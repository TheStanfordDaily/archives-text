# Carnegie Commission Criticizes Existing Health Care Systems
## 
### 
"Americans deserve and can afford
better health care," contends the
recently released report of the Carnegie
Commission on Medical Education in
the United States. According to the
report, the United States has the
"highest standard of living but not the
highest standard of life."
The commission concludes that top
priority should be placed on providing
better health care systems for
Americans. Specific suggestions
include: 1) more and better health
manpower, 2) more and better health
care facilities, 3) better financial
arrangements for the health care of the
population and 3) better planning for
health manpower and health care
delivery.
Since 1910, medical schools in the
United States have applied the Flexner
Plan (developed by Dr. Abraham
Flexner) to medical research,
education, and health care delivery.
According to the report, "It has led
to great strides forward in the quality
of research and the quality of
individual medical practitioners."
Two Weaknesses
However, the Flexner method of
research has two major weaknesses. "It
largely ignores health care delivery
outside the medical school and its own
hospital, and it sets science in the
medical school apart from science on
the general campus with resulting
duplication of effort."
As a result, there has been excessive
waste of manpower, equipment, and
finances. Medical schools have had their
own departments carrying on research
which has been developed
simultaneously in other departments.
Citing this increasing waste, the

report suggests two new medical school
models.
The first is the health care delivery
model, where the medical school, in
addition to training, does research in
health care delivery, advises local
hospitals and health authorities, works
with community colleges and
comprehensive colleges on the training
of allied health personnel, carries on
continuing education for health
personnel, and generally orients itself
to external service.
The second is the integrated science
model, where most of all of the basic
science (and social science) instruction
is carried on within the main campus
(or other general campuses) and not
duplicated in the medical school, which
provides mainly clinical instruction.
New Direction
The Carnegie Commission believes
that the change from the Flexner plan
need not be universal. A few schools
and parts of other schools are
productive as they are, but the majority
of schools would better serve the public
if they moved in different directions.
According to Dr. David A. Hamburg,
executive head, Department of
Psychiatry, Stanford School of
Medicine, and member of the
Commission's advisory committee on
medical education said Stanford would
be one of the schools to retain a large
portion of the Flexner style research.
"Medicine is too broad a field to have
all research and all medical schools
participating in the same way. Stanford
has always had a strong commitment
to scientific research and should remain
as such."
The Commission cited other medical
problems existing in the country today.

"Although the best medical care in this
country is as good as any in the world,
many Americans receive inferior care,
and some health care needs go entirely
untreated." The major causes of this
problem are the geographic distribution
of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.
Rising Health Costs
In 1928-1929, total health care
expenditures amounted to 4 percent of
the gross national product. It rose to 7
percent in 1968-1969. Public
expenditures, greatly augmented after
the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 1965 , were meeting 36
percent of the total in 1968-69, while
private insurance benefits, despite the
fact that about four-fifths of the
population had some insurance
protection, were meeting only 22
percent.
The commission cited seven causes
for the discrepancy between the high
proportion of insured people and the
lack of total expenditures covered by
the insurance companies: 1) Provision
for services in the hospital is much
more common than for services in the
physician's office or in the home, 2)
there are limitations on reimbursable
charges, 3) psychiatric care is covered
only on a highly restricted basis, 4)
dental care is barely beginning to be
covered, although dental insurance
protection is now spreading quite
rapidly, 5) charges for health services
are typically made on a fee-for-service
basis, and increases in costs are passed
on in the form of higher premiums, 6)
hospital services are over-utilized,
except under prepaid comprehensive

plans, partly because so many people
have hospital insurance but no
protection for care outside the hospital,
and 7) despite much talk about the
need for preventive care, insurance
plans are poorly designed to encourage
it."
More Medical Students
To help alleviate the financial crisis
facing poor people who need medical
care, the Carnegie Commission
proposes a large increase in the number
of M.D. and D.D.S. students in

university health science centers. Also a
plan is proposed to expand the
programs for training medical and
dental assistants.
In addition to expanding medical
training in general, the commission
recommends that universities extend
training programs for women and
members of minority groups as medical
and dental students.
According to Dr. Hamburg,
emphasis was placed on the issue of
training more black, brown, and
women doctors. 'In addition to
training more doctors who represent
minorities, group practice methods
should be applied to better meet the
medical needs of the people. The Palo
Alto Medical Clinic is an example of
group practice. The clinic has a number
of doctors with different specialties all
practicing in the same place. If a
patient is examined by one doctor who
cannot treat an ailment as well as
another doctor, the patient can be sent
to another doctor in the same building
thus cutting a great deal of time and
expense. The Stanford Medical Center
has also begun this type of practice.
Increased Funding
The Carnegie commission believes
that medical and dental education are
critically underfunded and that greatly
increased financial support is required
to bring about 1) the development of a
sufficient and effective supply of
physicians and dentists and their
associates and assistants, 2) equality of
opportunity to enter these health
professions, 3) effective use of
educational resources, 4) regional
dispersion of health manpower
educational institutions, 5) equitable
distribution of the cost burden, and 6)
adaptation of health manpower
education to changing patterns of
health care delivery."

One of the reasons that people can't
get the medical care they should have is
simply that the cost of medical services
is far too expensive. Dr. Hamburg
commented, "This is true for
middle-income families as well as
low-income families. In the last 40
years medical costs have become
unreasonable for most Americans. A
more feasible health insurance scheme
is going to have to be developed.
"Under Medicare many doctors
charge high service fee rates knowing
that most of the money will come from

the government and not directly out of
the patient's pocket. One way or
another the costs get back to the
general public who are already suffering
from inadequate care."
According to Dr. Hamburg, "The
government is simply going to have to
control the costs of medical service. A
certain reasonable cost for a checkup or
an examination could easily be arrived
at and made into a nationwide fee so
there would be consistent service fees.
The Federal Government is going to
have to play a major role in changing
the direction of medical care."

model, where the medical school, in
addition to training, does research in
health care delivery, advises local
hospitals and health authorities, works
with community colleges and
comprehensive colleges on the training
of allied health personnel, carries on
continuing education for health
personnel, and generally orients itself
to external service.
The second is the integrated science
model, where most of all of the basic
science (and social science) instruction
is carried on within the main campus
(or other general campuses) and not
duplicated in the medical school, which
provides mainly clinical instruction.
New Direction
The Carnegie Commission believes
that the change from the Flexner plan
need not be universal. A few schools
and parts of other schools are
productive as they are, but the majority
of schools would better serve the public
if they moved in different directions.
According to Dr. David A. Hamburg,
executive head, Department of
Psychiatry, Stanford School of
Medicine, and member of the
Commission's advisory committee on
medical education said Stanford would
be one of the schools to retain a large
portion of the Flexner style research.
"Medicine is too broad a field to have
all research and all medical schools
participating in the same way. Stanford
has always had a strong commitment
to scientific research and should remain
as such."
The Commission cited other medical
problems existing in the country today.

"Although the best medical care in this
country is as good as any in the world,
many Americans receive inferior care,
and some health care needs go entirely
untreated." The major causes of this
problem are the geographic distribution
of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.
Rising Health Costs
In 1928-1929, total health care
expenditures amounted to 4 percent of
the gross national product. It rose to 7
percent in 1968-1969. Public
expenditures, greatly augmented after
the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 1965 , were meeting 36
percent of the total in 1968-69, while
private insurance benefits, despite the
fact that about four-fifths of the
population had some insurance
protection, were meeting only 22
percent.
The commission cited seven causes
for the discrepancy between the high
proportion of insured people and the
lack of total expenditures covered by
the insurance companies: 1) Provision
for services in the hospital is much
more common than for services in the
physician's office or in the home, 2)
there are limitations on reimbursable
charges, 3) psychiatric care is covered
only on a highly restricted basis, 4)
dental care is barely beginning to be
covered, although dental insurance
protection is now spreading quite
rapidly, 5) charges for health services
are typically made on a fee-for-service
basis, and increases in costs are passed
on in the form of higher premiums, 6)
hospital services are over-utilized,
except under prepaid comprehensive

plans, partly because so many people
have hospital insurance but no
protection for care outside the hospital,
and 7) despite much talk about the
need for preventive care, insurance
plans are poorly designed to encourage
it."

To help alleviate the financial crisis
facing poor people who need medical
care, the Carnegie Commission

university health science centers. Also a
plan is proposed to expand the
programs for training medical and
dental assistants.
In addition to expanding medical
training in general, the commission
recommends that universities extend
training programs for women and
members of minority groups as medical
and dental students.
According to Dr. Hamburg,
emphasis was placed on the issue of
training more black, brown, and
women doctors. 'In addition to
training more doctors who represent
minorities, group practice methods
should be applied to better meet the
medical needs of the people. The Palo
Alto Medical Clinic is an example of
group practice. The clinic has a number
of doctors with different specialties all
practicing in the same place. If a
patient is examined by one doctor who
cannot treat an ailment as well as
another doctor, the patient can be sent
to another doctor in the same building
thus cutting a great deal of time and
expense. The Stanford Medical Center
has also begun this type of practice.
Increased Funding
The Carnegie commission believes
that medical and dental education are
critically underfunded and that greatly
increased financial support is required
to bring about 1) the development of a
sufficient and effective supply of
physicians and dentists and their
associates and assistants, 2) equality of
opportunity to enter these health
professions, 3) effective use of
educational resources, 4) regional
dispersion of health manpower
educational institutions, 5) equitable
distribution of the cost burden, and 6)
adaptation of health manpower
education to changing patterns of
health care delivery."

One of the reasons that people can't
get the medical care they should have is
simply that the cost of medical services
is far too expensive. Dr. Hamburg
commented, "This is true for
middle-income families as well as
low-income families. In the last 40
years medical costs have become
unreasonable for most Americans. A
more feasible health insurance scheme
is going to have to be developed.
"Under Medicare many doctors
charge high service fee rates knowing
that most of the money will come from

the government and not directly out of
the patient's pocket. One way or
another the costs get back to the
general public who are already suffering
from inadequate care."
According to Dr. Hamburg, "The
government is simply going to have to
control the costs of medical service. A
certain reasonable cost for a checkup or
an examination could easily be arrived
at and made into a nationwide fee so
there would be consistent service fees.
The Federal Government is going to
have to play a major role in changing
the direction of medical care."
"Americans deserve and can afford
better health care," contends the
recently released report of the Carnegie
Commission on Medical Education in
the United States. According to the
report, the United States has the
"highest standard of living but not the
highest standard of life."
The commission concludes that top
priority should be placed on providing
better health care systems for
Americans. Specific suggestions
include: 1) more and better health
manpower, 2) more and better health
care facilities, 3) better financial
arrangements for the health care of the
population and 3) better planning for
health manpower and health care
delivery.
Since 1910, medical schools in the
United States have applied the Flexner
Plan (developed by Dr. Abraham
Flexner) to medical research,
education, and health care delivery.
According to the report, "It has led
to great strides forward in the quality
of research and the quality of
individual medical practitioners."
Two Weaknesses
However, the Flexner method of
research has two major weaknesses. "It
largely ignores health care delivery
outside the medical school and its own
hospital, and it sets science in the
medical school apart from science on
the general campus with resulting
duplication of effort."
As a result, there has been excessive
waste of manpower, equipment, and
finances. Medical schools have had their
own departments carrying on research
which has been developed
simultaneously in other departments.
Citing this increasing waste, the

report suggests two new medical school
models.

of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.
Rising Health Costs
In 1928-1929, total health care
expenditures amounted to 4 percent of
the gross national product. It rose to 7
percent in 1968-1969. Public
expenditures, greatly augmented after
the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 1965 , were meeting 36
percent of the total in 1968-69, while
private insurance benefits, despite the
fact that about four-fifths of the
population had some insurance
protection, were meeting only 22
percent.
The commission cited seven causes
for the discrepancy between the high
proportion of insured people and the
lack of total expenditures covered by
the insurance companies: 1) Provision
for services in the hospital is much
more common than for services in the
physician's office or in the home, 2)
there are limitations on reimbursable
charges, 3) psychiatric care is covered
only on a highly restricted basis, 4)
dental care is barely beginning to be
covered, although dental insurance
protection is now spreading quite
rapidly, 5) charges for health services
are typically made on a fee-for-service
basis, and increases in costs are passed
on in the form of higher premiums, 6)
hospital services are over-utilized,
except under prepaid comprehensive

plans, partly because so many people
have hospital insurance but no
protection for care outside the hospital,
and 7) despite much talk about the
need for preventive care, insurance
plans are poorly designed to encourage
it."

university health science centers. Also a
plan is proposed to expand the
programs for training medical and
dental assistants.
In addition to expanding medical
training in general, the commission
recommends that universities extend
training programs for women and
members of minority groups as medical
and dental students.
According to Dr. Hamburg,
emphasis was placed on the issue of
training more black, brown, and
women doctors. 'In addition to
training more doctors who represent
minorities, group practice methods
should be applied to better meet the
medical needs of the people. The Palo
Alto Medical Clinic is an example of
group practice. The clinic has a number
of doctors with different specialties all
practicing in the same place. If a
patient is examined by one doctor who
cannot treat an ailment as well as
another doctor, the patient can be sent
to another doctor in the same building
thus cutting a great deal of time and
expense. The Stanford Medical Center
has also begun this type of practice.
Increased Funding
The Carnegie commission believes
that medical and dental education are
critically underfunded and that greatly
increased financial support is required
to bring about 1) the development of a
sufficient and effective supply of
physicians and dentists and their
associates and assistants, 2) equality of
opportunity to enter these health
professions, 3) effective use of
educational resources, 4) regional
dispersion of health manpower
educational institutions, 5) equitable
distribution of the cost burden, and 6)
adaptation of health manpower
education to changing patterns of
health care delivery."

One of the reasons that people can't
get the medical care they should have is
simply that the cost of medical services
is far too expensive. Dr. Hamburg
commented, "This is true for
middle-income families as well as
low-income families. In the last 40
years medical costs have become
unreasonable for most Americans. A
more feasible health insurance scheme
is going to have to be developed.
"Under Medicare many doctors
charge high service fee rates knowing
that most of the money will come from

the government and not directly out of
the patient's pocket. One way or
another the costs get back to the
general public who are already suffering
from inadequate care."
According to Dr. Hamburg, "The
government is simply going to have to
control the costs of medical service. A
certain reasonable cost for a checkup or
an examination could easily be arrived
at and made into a nationwide fee so
there would be consistent service fees.
The Federal Government is going to
have to play a major role in changing
the direction of medical care."
"Americans deserve and can afford
better health care," contends the
recently released report of the Carnegie
Commission on Medical Education in
the United States. According to the
report, the United States has the
"highest standard of living but not the
highest standard of life."
The commission concludes that top
priority should be placed on providing
better health care systems for
Americans. Specific suggestions
include: 1) more and better health
manpower, 2) more and better health
care facilities, 3) better financial
arrangements for the health care of the
population and 3) better planning for
health manpower and health care
delivery.
Since 1910, medical schools in the
United States have applied the Flexner
Plan (developed by Dr. Abraham
Flexner) to medical research,
education, and health care delivery.
According to the report, "It has led
to great strides forward in the quality
of research and the quality of
individual medical practitioners."
Two Weaknesses
However, the Flexner method of
research has two major weaknesses. "It
largely ignores health care delivery
outside the medical school and its own
hospital, and it sets science in the
medical school apart from science on
the general campus with resulting
duplication of effort."
As a result, there has been excessive
waste of manpower, equipment, and
finances. Medical schools have had their
own departments carrying on research
which has been developed
simultaneously in other departments.
Citing this increasing waste, the

report suggests two new medical school
models.
The first is the health care delivery
model, where the medical school, in
addition to training, does research in
health care delivery, advises local
hospitals and health authorities, works
with community colleges and
comprehensive colleges on the training
of allied health personnel, carries on
continuing education for health
personnel, and generally orients itself
to external service.
The second is the integrated science
model, where most of all of the basic
science (and social science) instruction
is carried on within the main campus
(or other general campuses) and not
duplicated in the medical school, which
provides mainly clinical instruction.
New Direction
The Carnegie Commission believes
that the change from the Flexner plan
need not be universal. A few schools
and parts of other schools are
productive as they are, but the majority
of schools would better serve the public
if they moved in different directions.
According to Dr. David A. Hamburg,
executive head, Department of
Psychiatry, Stanford School of
Medicine, and member of the
Commission's advisory committee on
medical education said Stanford would
be one of the schools to retain a large
portion of the Flexner style research.
"Medicine is too broad a field to have
all research and all medical schools
participating in the same way. Stanford
has always had a strong commitment
to scientific research and should remain
as such."
The Commission cited other medical
problems existing in the country today.

"Although the best medical care in this
country is as good as any in the world,
many Americans receive inferior care,
and some health care needs go entirely
untreated." The major causes of this
problem are the geographic distribution
of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.

university health science centers. Also a
plan is proposed to expand the
programs for training medical and
dental assistants.
In addition to expanding medical
training in general, the commission
recommends that universities extend
training programs for women and
members of minority groups as medical
and dental students.
According to Dr. Hamburg,
emphasis was placed on the issue of
training more black, brown, and
women doctors. 'In addition to
training more doctors who represent
minorities, group practice methods
should be applied to better meet the
medical needs of the people. The Palo
Alto Medical Clinic is an example of
group practice. The clinic has a number
of doctors with different specialties all
practicing in the same place. If a
patient is examined by one doctor who
cannot treat an ailment as well as
another doctor, the patient can be sent
to another doctor in the same building
thus cutting a great deal of time and
expense. The Stanford Medical Center
has also begun this type of practice.
Increased Funding
The Carnegie commission believes
that medical and dental education are
critically underfunded and that greatly
increased financial support is required
to bring about 1) the development of a
sufficient and effective supply of
physicians and dentists and their
associates and assistants, 2) equality of
opportunity to enter these health
professions, 3) effective use of
educational resources, 4) regional
dispersion of health manpower
educational institutions, 5) equitable
distribution of the cost burden, and 6)
adaptation of health manpower
education to changing patterns of
health care delivery."

One of the reasons that people can't
get the medical care they should have is
simply that the cost of medical services
is far too expensive. Dr. Hamburg
commented, "This is true for
middle-income families as well as
low-income families. In the last 40
years medical costs have become
unreasonable for most Americans. A
more feasible health insurance scheme
is going to have to be developed.
"Under Medicare many doctors
charge high service fee rates knowing
that most of the money will come from

the government and not directly out of
the patient's pocket. One way or
another the costs get back to the
general public who are already suffering
from inadequate care."
According to Dr. Hamburg, "The
government is simply going to have to
control the costs of medical service. A
certain reasonable cost for a checkup or
an examination could easily be arrived
at and made into a nationwide fee so
there would be consistent service fees.
The Federal Government is going to
have to play a major role in changing
the direction of medical care."
"Americans deserve and can afford
better health care," contends the
recently released report of the Carnegie
Commission on Medical Education in
the United States. According to the
report, the United States has the
"highest standard of living but not the
highest standard of life."
The commission concludes that top
priority should be placed on providing
better health care systems for
Americans. Specific suggestions
include: 1) more and better health
manpower, 2) more and better health
care facilities, 3) better financial
arrangements for the health care of the
population and 3) better planning for
health manpower and health care
delivery.
Since 1910, medical schools in the
United States have applied the Flexner
Plan (developed by Dr. Abraham
Flexner) to medical research,
education, and health care delivery.
According to the report, "It has led
to great strides forward in the quality
of research and the quality of
individual medical practitioners."
Two Weaknesses
However, the Flexner method of
research has two major weaknesses. "It
largely ignores health care delivery
outside the medical school and its own
hospital, and it sets science in the
medical school apart from science on
the general campus with resulting
duplication of effort."
As a result, there has been excessive
waste of manpower, equipment, and
finances. Medical schools have had their
own departments carrying on research
which has been developed
simultaneously in other departments.
Citing this increasing waste, the

report suggests two new medical school
models.
The first is the health care delivery
model, where the medical school, in
addition to training, does research in
health care delivery, advises local
hospitals and health authorities, works
with community colleges and
comprehensive colleges on the training
of allied health personnel, carries on
continuing education for health
personnel, and generally orients itself
to external service.
The second is the integrated science
model, where most of all of the basic
science (and social science) instruction
is carried on within the main campus
(or other general campuses) and not
duplicated in the medical school, which
provides mainly clinical instruction.
New Direction
The Carnegie Commission believes
that the change from the Flexner plan
need not be universal. A few schools
and parts of other schools are
productive as they are, but the majority
of schools would better serve the public
if they moved in different directions.
According to Dr. David A. Hamburg,
executive head, Department of
Psychiatry, Stanford School of
Medicine, and member of the
Commission's advisory committee on
medical education said Stanford would
be one of the schools to retain a large
portion of the Flexner style research.
"Medicine is too broad a field to have
all research and all medical schools
participating in the same way. Stanford
has always had a strong commitment
to scientific research and should remain
as such."
The Commission cited other medical
problems existing in the country today.

"Although the best medical care in this
country is as good as any in the world,
many Americans receive inferior care,
and some health care needs go entirely
untreated." The major causes of this
problem are the geographic distribution
of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.
Rising Health Costs
In 1928-1929, total health care
expenditures amounted to 4 percent of
the gross national product. It rose to 7
percent in 1968-1969. Public
expenditures, greatly augmented after
the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 1965 , were meeting 36
percent of the total in 1968-69, while
private insurance benefits, despite the
fact that about four-fifths of the
population had some insurance
protection, were meeting only 22
percent.
The commission cited seven causes
for the discrepancy between the high
proportion of insured people and the
lack of total expenditures covered by
the insurance companies: 1) Provision
for services in the hospital is much
more common than for services in the
physician's office or in the home, 2)
there are limitations on reimbursable
charges, 3) psychiatric care is covered
only on a highly restricted basis, 4)
dental care is barely beginning to be
covered, although dental insurance
protection is now spreading quite
rapidly, 5) charges for health services
are typically made on a fee-for-service
basis, and increases in costs are passed
on in the form of higher premiums, 6)
hospital services are over-utilized,
except under prepaid comprehensive

plans, partly because so many people
have hospital insurance but no
protection for care outside the hospital,
and 7) despite much talk about the
need for preventive care, insurance
plans are poorly designed to encourage
it."
