# Carnegie Commission Criticizes Existing Health Care Systems
## 
### 
"Americans deserve and can afford
better health care," contends the
recently released report of the Carnegie
Commission on Medical Education in
the United States. According to the
report, the United States has the
"highest standard of living but not the
highest standard of life."
The commission concludes that top
priority should be placed on providing
better health care systems for
Americans. Specific suggestions
include: 1) more and better health
manpower, 2) more and better health
care facilities, 3) better financial
arrangements for the health care of the
population and 3) better planning for
health manpower and health care
delivery.
Since 1910, medical schools in the
United States have applied the Flexner
Plan (developed by Dr. Abraham
Flexner) to medical research,
education, and health care delivery.
According to the report, "It has led
to great strides forward in the quality
of research and the quality of
individual medical practitioners."
Two Weaknesses
However, the Flexner method of
research has two major weaknesses. "It
largely ignores health care delivery
outside the medical school and its own
hospital, and it sets science in the
medical school apart from science on
the general campus with resulting
duplication of effort."
As a result, there has been excessive
waste of manpower, equipment, and
finances. Medical schools have had their
own departments carrying on research
which has been developed
simultaneously in other departments.
Citing this increasing waste, the

report suggests two new medical school
models.
The first is the health care delivery
model, where the medical school, in
addition to training, does research in
health care delivery, advises local
hospitals and health authorities, works
with community colleges and
comprehensive colleges on the training
of allied health personnel, carries on
continuing education for health
personnel, and generally orients itself
to external service.
The second is the integrated science
model, where most of all of the basic
science (and social science) instruction
is carried on within the main campus
(or other general campuses) and not
duplicated in the medical school, which
provides mainly clinical instruction.
New Direction
The Carnegie Commission believes
that the change from the Flexner plan
need not be universal. A few schools
and parts of other schools are
productive as they are, but the majority
of schools would better serve the public
if they moved in different directions.
According to Dr. David A. Hamburg,
executive head, Department of
Psychiatry, Stanford School of
Medicine, and member of the
Commission's advisory committee on
medical education said Stanford would
be one of the schools to retain a large
portion of the Flexner style research.
"Medicine is too broad a field to have
all research and all medical schools
participating in the same way. Stanford
has always had a strong commitment
to scientific research and should remain
as such."
The Commission cited other medical
problems existing in the country today.

"Although the best medical care in this
country is as good as any in the world,
many Americans receive inferior care,
and some health care needs go entirely
untreated." The major causes of this
problem are the geographic distribution
of medical personnel, which is very
uneven, and medical expenses, which
have risen enormously in the last 40
years.
Rising Health Costs
In 1928-1929, total health care
expenditures amounted to 4 percent of
the gross national product. It rose to 7
percent in 1968-1969. Public
expenditures, greatly augmented after
the adoption of Medicare and Medicaid
programs in 1965 , were meeting 36
percent of the total in 1968-69, while
private insurance benefits, despite the
fact that about four-fifths of the
population had some insurance
protection, were meeting only 22
percent.
The commission cited seven causes
for the discrepancy between the high
proportion of insured people and the
lack of total expenditures covered by
the insurance companies: 1) Provision
for services in the hospital is much
more common than for services in the
physician's office or in the home, 2)
there are limitations on reimbursable
charges, 3) psychiatric care is covered
only on a highly restricted basis, 4)
dental care is barely beginning to be
covered, although dental insurance
protection is now spreading quite
rapidly, 5) charges for health services
are typically made on a fee-for-service
basis, and increases in costs are passed
on in the form of higher premiums, 6)
hospital services are over-utilized,
except under prepaid comprehensive

plans, partly because so many people
have hospital insurance but no
protection for care outside the hospital,
and 7) despite much talk about the
need for preventive care, insurance
plans are poorly designed to encourage
it."
More Medical Students
To help alleviate the financial crisis
facing poor people who need medical
care, the Carnegie Commission
proposes a large increase in the number
of M.D. and D.D.S. students in
