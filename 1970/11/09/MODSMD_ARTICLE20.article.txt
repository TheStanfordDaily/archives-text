# Victory Cannon Mishap Injures Two At Game
## 
### 
The Stanford cannon crew took
special precautions Saturday to prevent
any accidents such as the one which
occurred last weekend in a football
halftime show in New Orleans.
The new measures didn't work. In
fact, they may have been the cause of
the explosion that sent two crew
members to the hospital during the first
quarter of the Stanford-Washington
football game.
Rick Leicher and Sam Boot were
knocked to the ground and burned
when the cannon, long a fixture in
Stanford Stadium, unexpectedly went
off while it was being reloaded. They
were rushed to the Stanford Medical
Center where Boot suffering from
burns on his hands was released the
same night.
Leicher was more seriously injured.
He suffered burns on the face, possible
third degree burns on his hands, and a
cut cornea. He will remain with his
hands in traction in Hoover Pavilion at
least until Wednesday, and may need a

skin graft.
According to Leicher, the new
procedures called for blowing out the
barrel with air after each firing to cool
the gun. After Stanford's first
touchdown, the cannon was fired and
immediately reloaded for the extra
point. The cooling air apparently
fanned the flame from the recent firing
and when the new powder was added,
it exploded immediately, sending the
ramrod 130 yards and felling the two
victims. Leicher was gripping the
ramrod when the explosion occurred
and underwent surgery for two and
one-half hours on his badly damaged
hands.
The cannon crew was also using a
new type of rapid-burning,
fast-compression powder.
Last weekend, the New Orleans
Saints football team staged "The Battle
of New Orleans" at halftime of their
game with the Los Angeles Rams.
Numerous cannons backfired, maiming
several performers.
