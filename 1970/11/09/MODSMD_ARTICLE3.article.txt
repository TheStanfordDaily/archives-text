# Los Siete 'Not Guilty' Of Murder
## 
### 
After 18 months in jail and a 17 week trial, six Latinos
won acquittal Friday night on charges of murdering
patrolman Joseph Brodnik and attempting to murder his
partner patrolman Paul McGoran during an encounter and
fight on May 1 , 1969.
However, the large audience of relatives, friends, and
supporters were shocked to hear that the men are not yet
to be freed. Allegedly, all six of the defendants were
arrested in a stolen car at gun point bv Santa Cruz police.
It was the first time that defense lawyer Charles Garry
had heard of the detention.
The jury was sent back for deliberation on the burglary
charges for two hours. About 7 5 Los Siete supporters
waited outside the courtroom for the announcement of the
second verdict.
After hearing testimony that Brodnik had been shot by
McGoran accidently and that McGoran had provoked the
fight which resulted in the shooting, the jury acquitted all
defendants of murder and attempted murder charges.
Accepting the alibis of Nelson Rodriguez and Rodolfo
Martinez that they were not present at the shooting, the
jury also acquitted them of the burglary charges. They were
deadlocked over burglary charges against the other four:
Gary Lescallet, Mario Martinez, Jose Rios and Danilo
Melendez.

A mistrial was declared and $1000 bail set for each of
the defendants pending a new trial.
Garry stated that he did not think the defendants got a
fair trial and that Judge Lawrence Mana and prosecutor
Thomas Norman had tried to "railroad them right and
left."
He added that McGoran should be put on trial for
"Perjury and attempting to commit the murder of these six
beautiful persons."
Garry was bitter yesterday and charged that his clients
failed to get fair treatment from Judge Mana. "If they had
been treated fairly," he said, "they wouldn't have been put
on trial. We've had this charade for 4-1 /2 months."
The team of four defense lawyers had contended
throughout the trial that Norman and Mana were trying to
railroad the youths into the gas chamber.
One of the main points of the defense throughout the
case was the apparent hot temper and racist attitude of the
prosecution's key witness Patrolman McGoran. According
to the successful defense, McGoran had started the fight
with Gary Lascallet for no apparent reason.
McGoran's wife testified that she had seen him brutalize
persons he chanced upon while off-duty and that he also
beat her up.
Four of the six defendants must now face burglary
charges in Santa Cruz and San Mateo counties.
