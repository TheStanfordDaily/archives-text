# Coffin--A Prophet With Vision, But No Immediate Direction
## 
### KAY GUSTAFSON FELICITY BARRINGER 
He knelt, engrossed, pleading for
guidance from his Deity. When he
spoke, it was powerfully, with speed
and sureness, as if he were empowered
to rule the hearts and souls of the flock
before him. He commanded his
dominion, his congregation, with
expressive, stacatto gestures and
dramatic intonations.
*****
He sat, subdued, thinking somewhat
distractedly. When he spoke, it was
coolly, with slowness and some doubt.
He was a simpler man conversing with
only a few listeners. His inner anxiety
was evident in the constant drumming
of his fingers, the jerks of his hand. His
nails were bitten to the quick.
The first, the Rev. Dr. William
Sloane Coffin, a preacher controlling
the thoughts of nearly 2000 in
Memorial Church on Sunday morning.
The second. Bill Coffin, was a man
sharing thoughts with only four people
on the terrace of the Faculty Club
yesterday afternoon.
Both the same . man. Both
communicated a frustrating lack of
immediate direction.
Coffin has been and is a man of
strong conviction. But now he sees no
clear path to follow. His sermon
yesterday morning spoke of a
"psychological moratorium" being
suffered by the nation; he said
yesterday afternoon that he was
suffering from the same moratorium.
"We know we can do a lot of things
to make things worse—but we're not
sure right now what we can do to make
things better. A great many of us are
sure we're not sure what to do.
"It's quite all right not to know
what to do."
Coffin spoke quietly, condemning
the "naive" attitude of revolutionaries
who want to provoke repression.
"We're in a pre-revolutionary
situation," he said, "not a

revolutionary one. For a revolution,
you need either any army or a
movement—we have neither. It's wrong
to be precipitate.
"We're in for the long haul."
He discussed the dilemma facing
those people who want to "make a
decent living, and live a decent
life"—and who find it sometimes
impossible to do both.
"People are not now joining up with
the giant corporations. They're
withdrawing their support from these
institutions, finding alternative ways.
The tough thing is finding alternative
tools to work with.
"Students, in the past, have shown
an enormous amount of concern. Now
they have to develop competence.
Competence has to match concern.
"Perhaps only patient, pedestrian
tactics will be effective."

A note of discouragement entered
his voice. "Just as Europe lost a
generation of youth after World War I,
the United States has lost one after the
6 o's." He sighed. "Maybe there will be
no future interest in public life."
His face brightened a little as he
spoke of the Church's position in the
future, and the path it should take.
"The Church should wage a lover's
quarrel with the nation and the world, '
he said.
There was conviction in Coffin's
words at the Faculty Club. There was a
tenseness about the man, at times a
slight air of preoccupation. But the
words were straightforward, sure. But
with no clear action in mind, with no
clear path to follow, Coffin's words,
spoken with conviction, seemed
inspirationless.

The tough thing is finding alternative
tools to work with.
"Students, in the past, have shown
an enormous amount of concern. Now
they have to develop competence.
Competence has to match concern.
"Perhaps only patient, pedestrian
tactics will be effective."

A note of discouragement entered
his voice. "Just as Europe lost a
generation of youth after World War I,
the United States has lost one after the
6 o's." He sighed. "Maybe there will be
no future interest in public life."
His face brightened a little as he
spoke of the Church's position in the
future, and the path it should take.
"The Church should wage a lover's
quarrel with the nation and the world, '
he said.
There was conviction in Coffin's
words at the Faculty Club. There was a
tenseness about the man, at times a
slight air of preoccupation. But the
words were straightforward, sure. But
with no clear action in mind, with no
clear path to follow, Coffin's words,
spoken with conviction, seemed
inspirationless.
He knelt, engrossed, pleading for
guidance from his Deity. When he
spoke, it was powerfully, with speed
and sureness, as if he were empowered
to rule the hearts and souls of the flock
before him. He commanded his
dominion, his congregation, with
expressive, stacatto gestures and
dramatic intonations.

He sat, subdued, thinking somewhat
distractedly. When he spoke, it was
coolly, with slowness and some doubt.
He was a simpler man conversing with
only a few listeners. His inner anxiety
was evident in the constant drumming
of his fingers, the jerks of his hand. His
nails were bitten to the quick.

Sloane Coffin, a preacher controlling
the thoughts of nearly 2000 in
Memorial Church on Sunday morning.
The second. Bill Coffin, was a man
sharing thoughts with only four people
on the terrace of the Faculty Club
yesterday afternoon.
Both the same . man. Both
communicated a frustrating lack of
immediate direction.
Coffin has been and is a man of
strong conviction. But now he sees no
clear path to follow. His sermon
yesterday morning spoke of a
"psychological moratorium" being
suffered by the nation; he said
yesterday afternoon that he was
suffering from the same moratorium.
"We know we can do a lot of things
to make things worse—but we're not
sure right now what we can do to make
things better. A great many of us are
sure we're not sure what to do.
"It's quite all right not to know
what to do."
Coffin spoke quietly, condemning
the "naive" attitude of revolutionaries
who want to provoke repression.
"We're in a pre-revolutionary
situation," he said, "not a

revolutionary one. For a revolution,
you need either any army or a
movement—we have neither. It's wrong
to be precipitate.
"We're in for the long haul."
He discussed the dilemma facing
those people who want to "make a
decent living, and live a decent
life"—and who find it sometimes
impossible to do both.
"People are not now joining up with
the giant corporations. They're
withdrawing their support from these
institutions, finding alternative ways.
