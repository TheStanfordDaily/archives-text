# sabre—toothed tigers
## The 						Power Specialists 
### BARRY WOOD 
In the evolutionary past the
survival of a species has often
been tied to the development of
specialized tools and skills. The
horns of antelope and elk, the
long neck of the giraffe, and the
running legs of the horse are
survival features, along with the
wings of birds and claws of hawks.
With men survival features
took a new turn. A completely
generalized hand and arm allowed
man to turn his fingers into any
shape, simply by grasping a tool.
Moreover, his naked and weak
body demanded the cooperation
found in family and social
structures. Despite Robinson
Crusoe, a single man is not well
equipped for brute survival.
Man's incredible rise to
planetary dominance has been
made possible by cooperation, by
the joint efforts that led to
farming, herding, mining, city
building, and political
organization. Ultimately, of
course, these joint efforts led back
into specialization again,
occupational and cultural.
And there is the rub.
Specialization leads back into
primitive survival problems
connected with horns and claws.
Horns and claws are marvelously
effective, but we are reminded
that the sabre-toothed tiger
probably became extinct because
his teeth became too long and
heavy to haul about.
There is nothing wrong with
human specialization except those
forms of it which center on
power. The position of power

depends on a master-slave
relationship, since power means
power over someone else. When
such power is hitched to the
divine, a pope holds the keys to
heaven. When linked to money,
power leads to a corrupt
monarchy. When linked to
technology, power leads to the
police state of 19 84 .
Horatio Alger
In the developed nations of the
world, power has become linked
to slavery, money, and
technology. Its mythology is that
everyone can become a
Master—the Horatio Alger myth.
Its reality is that most people will
remain slaves. They are slaves
because money buys power in the
form of technology, and the
resources consumed by that
technology leave the slaves
depleted of any means of cashing
in on the system
To support the Masters of the
developed countries many
specialized institutions have been
devised. "Capitalism:" a means by
which those who have money can
make more of it. The "Assembly
Line:" a means by which
resources must flow through the
hands of the rich before being
measured out to the poor.
"Education:" a means by which
subversive types will not make it
into the system, thus keeping it
"pure." "Atomic warfare:" a
means by which those in power
are assured of remaining in power.
"Racism:" a means by which
one's superior position is justified.
"Economic aid:" a means by
which the slaves are bribed and
the strong are relieved of guilt,
while the Master-slave relationship
is not endangered.
While those in power are
traditionally responsible for the
survival of themselves and their
slaves, the Power Specialists have
lost the means of survival. Failing
to remain healthy and lean, they
have gobbled up so much food
and goodies that millions of slaves
are sick and dying.
Subliminal Power
Corrupted by the exploitation
of slaves around the world, the

Barry wood

Power Specialists have learned to
exploit each other. Through the
soporific power of TV and the
subliminal power of the unclad
female body, all the Masters are
daily convincing each other that
everybody "needs" two cars,
three houses, four pair of shoes,
untold numbers of face creams
and colors, electric toothbrushes,
four-channel stereo, and an
incredible array of products which
are on the verge of collapse before
they are unpacked and
obsolescent as soon as used. This
unbelievable array of things
enslaves the Masters and draws off
the riches of the slaves who have
nothing to show for it but DDT in
their fat and strontium 90 in their
bones, defoliated farm lands and
poisoned air overhead—along with
the false hopes of American
affluence which is paraded
through the world-wide
circulation of Time, Life,
Playboy, Better Homes and
Gardens, and the American
tourist.
The flaw of the Power
Specialists is that his support
system is not confined to the
slavery system. Both Masters and
slaves are chained to a flying rock
way out in space where the failure
of one of their "systems" will
leave them doomed to die in
orbit. There is no earthly home
base to return to and the hope of
"pie in the sky when you die" has
been recently debunked by the
death of God theologians.
Tinker-Toy
The whole situation is tragic
from the inside and ludicrous
from the outside. The Power
Specialists have built a tinker-toy
world with all the seriousness of
ants building a hill. Yet these ants
have invented their own
insecticides.
If there is any truth to this
analysis it might lie in the fact
that nonsense like Capitalism,
Assembly Lines, American
Education, Atomic Warfare,
Racism, and Economic Aid are
the oversized sabre-teeth of the
Power Specialists—rapidly
becoming too cumbersome for the
rest of the system to support.

There is nothing wrong with
human specialization except those
forms of it which center on
power. The position of power

depends on a master-slave
relationship, since power means
power over someone else. When
such power is hitched to the
divine, a pope holds the keys to
heaven. When linked to money,
power leads to a corrupt
monarchy. When linked to
technology, power leads to the
police state of 19 84 .
Horatio Alger
In the developed nations of the
world, power has become linked
to slavery, money, and
technology. Its mythology is that
everyone can become a
Master—the Horatio Alger myth.
Its reality is that most people will
remain slaves. They are slaves
because money buys power in the
form of technology, and the
resources consumed by that
technology leave the slaves
depleted of any means of cashing
in on the system
To support the Masters of the
developed countries many
specialized institutions have been
devised. "Capitalism:" a means by
which those who have money can
make more of it. The "Assembly
Line:" a means by which
resources must flow through the
hands of the rich before being
measured out to the poor.
"Education:" a means by which
subversive types will not make it
into the system, thus keeping it
"pure." "Atomic warfare:" a
means by which those in power
are assured of remaining in power.
"Racism:" a means by which
one's superior position is justified.
"Economic aid:" a means by
which the slaves are bribed and
the strong are relieved of guilt,
while the Master-slave relationship
is not endangered.
While those in power are
traditionally responsible for the
survival of themselves and their
slaves, the Power Specialists have
lost the means of survival. Failing
to remain healthy and lean, they
have gobbled up so much food
and goodies that millions of slaves
are sick and dying.
Subliminal Power
Corrupted by the exploitation
of slaves around the world, the

Barry wood

Power Specialists have learned to
exploit each other. Through the
soporific power of TV and the
subliminal power of the unclad
female body, all the Masters are
daily convincing each other that
everybody "needs" two cars,
three houses, four pair of shoes,
untold numbers of face creams
and colors, electric toothbrushes,
four-channel stereo, and an
incredible array of products which
are on the verge of collapse before
they are unpacked and
obsolescent as soon as used. This
unbelievable array of things
enslaves the Masters and draws off
the riches of the slaves who have
nothing to show for it but DDT in
their fat and strontium 90 in their
bones, defoliated farm lands and
poisoned air overhead—along with
the false hopes of American
affluence which is paraded
through the world-wide
circulation of Time, Life,
Playboy, Better Homes and
Gardens, and the American
tourist.
The flaw of the Power
Specialists is that his support
system is not confined to the
slavery system. Both Masters and
slaves are chained to a flying rock
way out in space where the failure
of one of their "systems" will
leave them doomed to die in
orbit. There is no earthly home
base to return to and the hope of
"pie in the sky when you die" has
been recently debunked by the
death of God theologians.
Tinker-Toy
The whole situation is tragic
from the inside and ludicrous
from the outside. The Power
Specialists have built a tinker-toy
world with all the seriousness of
ants building a hill. Yet these ants
have invented their own
insecticides.
If there is any truth to this
analysis it might lie in the fact
that nonsense like Capitalism,
Assembly Lines, American
Education, Atomic Warfare,
Racism, and Economic Aid are
the oversized sabre-teeth of the
Power Specialists—rapidly
becoming too cumbersome for the
rest of the system to support.
In the evolutionary past the
survival of a species has often
been tied to the development of
specialized tools and skills. The
horns of antelope and elk, the
long neck of the giraffe, and the
running legs of the horse are
survival features, along with the
wings of birds and claws of hawks.
With men survival features
took a new turn. A completely
generalized hand and arm allowed
man to turn his fingers into any
shape, simply by grasping a tool.
Moreover, his naked and weak
body demanded the cooperation
found in family and social
structures. Despite Robinson
Crusoe, a single man is not well
equipped for brute survival.
Man's incredible rise to
planetary dominance has been
made possible by cooperation, by
the joint efforts that led to
farming, herding, mining, city
building, and political
organization. Ultimately, of
course, these joint efforts led back
into specialization again,
occupational and cultural.
And there is the rub.
Specialization leads back into
primitive survival problems
connected with horns and claws.
Horns and claws are marvelously
effective, but we are reminded
that the sabre-toothed tiger
probably became extinct because
his teeth became too long and
heavy to haul about.

hands of the rich before being
measured out to the poor.
"Education:" a means by which
subversive types will not make it
into the system, thus keeping it
"pure." "Atomic warfare:" a
means by which those in power
are assured of remaining in power.
"Racism:" a means by which
one's superior position is justified.
"Economic aid:" a means by
which the slaves are bribed and
the strong are relieved of guilt,
while the Master-slave relationship
is not endangered.
While those in power are
traditionally responsible for the
survival of themselves and their
slaves, the Power Specialists have
lost the means of survival. Failing
to remain healthy and lean, they
have gobbled up so much food
and goodies that millions of slaves
are sick and dying.
Subliminal Power
Corrupted by the exploitation
of slaves around the world, the

Barry wood

Power Specialists have learned to
exploit each other. Through the
soporific power of TV and the
subliminal power of the unclad
female body, all the Masters are
daily convincing each other that
everybody "needs" two cars,
three houses, four pair of shoes,
untold numbers of face creams
and colors, electric toothbrushes,
four-channel stereo, and an
incredible array of products which
are on the verge of collapse before
they are unpacked and
obsolescent as soon as used. This
unbelievable array of things
enslaves the Masters and draws off
the riches of the slaves who have
nothing to show for it but DDT in
their fat and strontium 90 in their
bones, defoliated farm lands and
poisoned air overhead—along with
the false hopes of American
affluence which is paraded
through the world-wide
circulation of Time, Life,
Playboy, Better Homes and
Gardens, and the American
tourist.
The flaw of the Power
Specialists is that his support
system is not confined to the
slavery system. Both Masters and
slaves are chained to a flying rock
way out in space where the failure
of one of their "systems" will
leave them doomed to die in
orbit. There is no earthly home
base to return to and the hope of
"pie in the sky when you die" has
been recently debunked by the
death of God theologians.
Tinker-Toy
The whole situation is tragic
from the inside and ludicrous
from the outside. The Power
Specialists have built a tinker-toy
world with all the seriousness of
ants building a hill. Yet these ants
have invented their own
insecticides.
If there is any truth to this
analysis it might lie in the fact
that nonsense like Capitalism,
Assembly Lines, American
Education, Atomic Warfare,
Racism, and Economic Aid are
the oversized sabre-teeth of the
Power Specialists—rapidly
becoming too cumbersome for the
rest of the system to support.
In the evolutionary past the
survival of a species has often
been tied to the development of
specialized tools and skills. The
horns of antelope and elk, the
long neck of the giraffe, and the
running legs of the horse are
survival features, along with the
wings of birds and claws of hawks.
With men survival features
took a new turn. A completely
generalized hand and arm allowed
man to turn his fingers into any
shape, simply by grasping a tool.
Moreover, his naked and weak
body demanded the cooperation
found in family and social
structures. Despite Robinson
Crusoe, a single man is not well
equipped for brute survival.
Man's incredible rise to
planetary dominance has been
made possible by cooperation, by
the joint efforts that led to
farming, herding, mining, city
building, and political
organization. Ultimately, of
course, these joint efforts led back
into specialization again,
occupational and cultural.
And there is the rub.
Specialization leads back into
primitive survival problems
connected with horns and claws.
Horns and claws are marvelously
effective, but we are reminded
that the sabre-toothed tiger
probably became extinct because
his teeth became too long and
heavy to haul about.
There is nothing wrong with
human specialization except those
forms of it which center on
power. The position of power

depends on a master-slave
relationship, since power means
power over someone else. When
such power is hitched to the
divine, a pope holds the keys to
heaven. When linked to money,
power leads to a corrupt
monarchy. When linked to
technology, power leads to the
police state of 19 84 .
Horatio Alger
In the developed nations of the
world, power has become linked
to slavery, money, and
technology. Its mythology is that
everyone can become a
Master—the Horatio Alger myth.
Its reality is that most people will
remain slaves. They are slaves
because money buys power in the
form of technology, and the
resources consumed by that
technology leave the slaves
depleted of any means of cashing
in on the system
To support the Masters of the
developed countries many
specialized institutions have been
devised. "Capitalism:" a means by
which those who have money can
make more of it. The "Assembly
Line:" a means by which
resources must flow through the
hands of the rich before being
measured out to the poor.
"Education:" a means by which
subversive types will not make it
into the system, thus keeping it
"pure." "Atomic warfare:" a
means by which those in power
are assured of remaining in power.
"Racism:" a means by which
one's superior position is justified.
"Economic aid:" a means by
which the slaves are bribed and
the strong are relieved of guilt,
while the Master-slave relationship
is not endangered.
