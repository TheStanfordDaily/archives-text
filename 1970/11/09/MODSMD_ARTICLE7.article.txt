Dear President Lyman,
The Teamsters, U.S.E., the United Electrical Workers, the Workers
Action Caucus, and S.E.A. are organizing a mass meeting of all
Stanford workers on Friday, November 13, in Cubberley Auditorium.
So that all workers may attend without penalty, we ask that the
administration grant a half day of paid time off on that afternoon.
As you know, the National Labor Relations Board is now holding
hearings in San Francisco to determine as "appropriate bargaining
unit" for Stanford workers and to determine which unions will have
the opportunity to represent workers in that unit. Even though these
hearings will have a strong effect on our lives, they are impossible for
us to attend due to the time and place they are being held.
Consequently, we have a difficult time learning about the unions
and issues involved, particularly since the only information we receive
comes from the administration. Many rumors are circulating among
the workersâ€”that clerical workers (nearly all of them women) will be
excluded from the bargaining unit, that Third World groups will have
no right to organize separately, that S.E.A. is a "company union," etc.
It is in order to remedy this situation that we have planned a mass
meeting where the representatives of the relevant unions and other
organized groups can debate the issues and where we workers can
begin to learn which group will best serve our interests.
Stanford students just received two days off for campaign work.
Administrators and faculty members commonly receive paid time off
for conferences, travel, sabbatical leave, etc. Our request for one half
day of paid time off to discuss a matter so crucial is very reasonable.
Teamsters, U.S.E.,
United Electrical Workers,
Workers Action Caucus,
S.E.A.
