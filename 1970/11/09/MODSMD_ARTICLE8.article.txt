Editor, THE DAILY:
For sight-seeing on Stanford
Campus there is always the
perpetually earthbound
moon-rocket reach of Hoover
Tower, the mosaicked spread of
Mem. Church and the
monumental columns supporting
the Museum.
But give me (an occasional
visitor to the academic environs),
the Coffee Room, which is a little
gem lying buried in the back-end
of the Art Gallery—just a step or
two from Nathan Oliveira's
Lithographic Shop.
1 write this letter to thank the
University, and especially the Art
department, for the privilege of
frequenting this lovely and
charming place to dawdle over
coffee. Lining its walls are scenic
paintings from the Stanford
family collection showing The
Farm's original lay-out, and the
whole effect is mellowed by the
lighting which idles softly from
olden chandeliers with long glass
pendants which reflect memories
of a kind of elegance long gone.
Even the chairs around the tables
seem to have come straight out of
the past from the Potato-eaters'
kitchen.
Actually, the only things out
of place are the machine-age
vending machines—but they are
defensively lined-up against the
rear wall!
Sincerely yours,

PATU Action
Editor, THE DAILY:
The editorial by B.L. in last
Thursday's Daily states that the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union (PATU)
"has...apparently decided that
working through the
governmental structure is
counter-productive." This is
incorrect.
PATU is currently involved in a
lawsuit in federal court which
claims that the city of Palo Alto is
violating the right of freedom of
association by enforcing certain
zoning laws against communes in
Palo Alto. Also, PATU was

involved in the recent Willow
Expressway hearings, as it will
continue to be in the future.
What is correct is that PATU has,
as an organization, stopped
attending rubber-stamp city
council meetings.
Most people in PATU believe
that "working through the
governmental structure" may or
may not be productive, depending
on the concrete situation. What is
not productive is to rely
exclusively on that structure,
which—as B.L. points out in his
editorial - has shown absolutely no
indication of being responsive to
the real housing needs of the
Mid-Peninsula.
The governmental structure,
whether at the local, state, or
federal level, is interested in such
profitable ventures as the "Willow
Expressway plan which would
destroy 433 units of housing in
the area," not in the economically
unsound task of satisfying
citizens' basic needs.
Thus, to rely exclusively or
even primarily on the
"governmental structures" would
be a big mistake. Only when we
start to take control of our own
lives, through our own peoples'
structures (such as PATU), will
the basic needs of all of us really
begin to be met.
Power to the people!

Dog Attack
Editor, The Daily:
On Sunday afternoon, October
25, 1970, my family and 1 were
leaving Tresidder Union when a
pack of five dogs swept through
us. One large short-haired black
clog in the pack bit my seven year
old son on the buttock. After 1
chased the pack out into the
Union court yard, I returned to
the front of the Union where my
wife and four year old son were
attending the seven year old son.
Before I realized what was
happening, the same pack of dogs
swept through again, knocked my
four year old son to the ground.

and the same large short-haired
black dog bit the four year old
son on the leg. This pack of five
dogs had been chased from inside
the Union only a few minutes
earlier. Both incidents were totally
unprovoked.
A campus policeman happened
by shortly after the incident. He
attempted to catch the one dog
that had done the biting, but he
would have been bitten also if he
had forcibly attempted to catch
the dog with his bare hands. At
this time, the policeman called the
county dog catcher, and 1 left to
carry my two sons to the hospital.
By some stroke of good luck
(after a sufficient supply of bad
luck for one day) both dog bites
had only scratched the skin.
After returning from the
hospital, I learned from the police
that the dog had not been
captured. Only then did 1 realize
how very lucky the children had
been in that the bites did not
puncture the skin. Can you
imagine telling your small children
that they must undergo the
extremely painful rabies
treatment that consists of
fourteen to twenty-one shots all
because someone was not
considerate enough to keep their
dog on a leash and the University
makes no overt attempt to
enforce the existing leash law. (It
should be noted that the
antirabies vaccine is not
universally effective and may give
rise to dangerous complications.
These complications may range
from local allergic reactions to
general paralysis.)
The above incident was
reported to the Daily on Sunday
afternoon in an attempt to get
some publicity for the serious dog
problem on campus. To this date,
nothing has appeared in the Daily.
Some people have figuratively
stated that Stanford is going to
the dogs. 1 believe that Stanford
has literally gone to the dogs. If
you agree with this, then please
make your feelings known to Hal
Wilson, university health officer
and also to President Lyman's
office.

Call To Violence?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the aftermath of the article
by D. McGuire published October
2, you voted to carry the
responsibility to prevent future
publication of calls for specific
acts of violence.
On Friday, October 30, the
heading to your letters column
carried S. Krute's cartoon call for
fire bombing the Bank of
America. The cartoon clearly
shows the Palo Alto area as the
location, gasoline in a Coke bottle
as the instrument and B of A as
the target. To my mind these are
specific enough to show that for
you the responsibility you took
up in early October did not last
out the month.
I'm sure that you can stretch
your concept of Free speech to
cover Krute's cute cartoon, but
please remember Wisconsin and
Isla Vista as you do.
Yours in peace and
non-violence.

My dear Prof. Franklin:
Glad you finally noticed my
secret instructions to you.
Congratulations; the logo first ran
5 months ago. Why haven't you
carried out my orders yet?
You did miss one point,
however. 1 do not call for, nor
condone in any way, the
destruction of a Bank of America.
I do, however, wholeheartedly
endorse any means by which
copies of the Palo Alto Times can
be ecologically erased.

A campus policeman happened
by shortly after the incident. He
attempted to catch the one dog
that had done the biting, but he
would have been bitten also if he
had forcibly attempted to catch
the dog with his bare hands. At
this time, the policeman called the
county dog catcher, and 1 left to
carry my two sons to the hospital.
By some stroke of good luck
(after a sufficient supply of bad
luck for one day) both dog bites
had only scratched the skin.
After returning from the
hospital, I learned from the police
that the dog had not been
captured. Only then did 1 realize
how very lucky the children had
been in that the bites did not
puncture the skin. Can you
imagine telling your small children
that they must undergo the
extremely painful rabies
treatment that consists of
fourteen to twenty-one shots all
because someone was not
considerate enough to keep their
dog on a leash and the University
makes no overt attempt to
enforce the existing leash law. (It
should be noted that the
antirabies vaccine is not
universally effective and may give
rise to dangerous complications.
These complications may range
from local allergic reactions to
general paralysis.)
The above incident was
reported to the Daily on Sunday
afternoon in an attempt to get
some publicity for the serious dog
problem on campus. To this date,
nothing has appeared in the Daily.
Some people have figuratively
stated that Stanford is going to
the dogs. 1 believe that Stanford
has literally gone to the dogs. If
you agree with this, then please
make your feelings known to Hal
Wilson, university health officer
and also to President Lyman's
office.

Call To Violence?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the aftermath of the article
by D. McGuire published October
2, you voted to carry the
responsibility to prevent future
publication of calls for specific
acts of violence.
On Friday, October 30, the
heading to your letters column
carried S. Krute's cartoon call for
fire bombing the Bank of
America. The cartoon clearly
shows the Palo Alto area as the
location, gasoline in a Coke bottle
as the instrument and B of A as
the target. To my mind these are
specific enough to show that for
you the responsibility you took
up in early October did not last
out the month.
I'm sure that you can stretch
your concept of Free speech to
cover Krute's cute cartoon, but
please remember Wisconsin and
Isla Vista as you do.
Yours in peace and
non-violence.

Congratulations; the logo first ran

You did miss one point,
however. 1 do not call for, nor

I do, however, wholeheartedly

PATU Action
Editor, THE DAILY:
The editorial by B.L. in last
Thursday's Daily states that the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union (PATU)
"has...apparently decided that
working through the
governmental structure is
counter-productive." This is
incorrect.
PATU is currently involved in a
lawsuit in federal court which
claims that the city of Palo Alto is
violating the right of freedom of
association by enforcing certain
zoning laws against communes in
Palo Alto. Also, PATU was

involved in the recent Willow
Expressway hearings, as it will
continue to be in the future.
What is correct is that PATU has,
as an organization, stopped
attending rubber-stamp city
council meetings.
Most people in PATU believe
that "working through the
governmental structure" may or
may not be productive, depending
on the concrete situation. What is
not productive is to rely
exclusively on that structure,
which—as B.L. points out in his
editorial - has shown absolutely no
indication of being responsive to
the real housing needs of the
Mid-Peninsula.
The governmental structure,
whether at the local, state, or
federal level, is interested in such
profitable ventures as the "Willow
Expressway plan which would
destroy 433 units of housing in
the area," not in the economically
unsound task of satisfying
citizens' basic needs.
Thus, to rely exclusively or
even primarily on the
"governmental structures" would
be a big mistake. Only when we
start to take control of our own
lives, through our own peoples'
structures (such as PATU), will
the basic needs of all of us really
begin to be met.
Power to the people!

Dog Attack
Editor, The Daily:
On Sunday afternoon, October
25, 1970, my family and 1 were
leaving Tresidder Union when a
pack of five dogs swept through
us. One large short-haired black
clog in the pack bit my seven year
old son on the buttock. After 1
chased the pack out into the
Union court yard, I returned to
the front of the Union where my
wife and four year old son were
attending the seven year old son.
Before I realized what was
happening, the same pack of dogs
swept through again, knocked my
four year old son to the ground.

and the same large short-haired
black dog bit the four year old
son on the leg. This pack of five
dogs had been chased from inside
the Union only a few minutes
earlier. Both incidents were totally

PATU Action
Editor, THE DAILY:
The editorial by B.L. in last
Thursday's Daily states that the
Palo Alto Tenants' Union (PATU)
"has...apparently decided that
working through the
governmental structure is
counter-productive." This is
incorrect.
PATU is currently involved in a
lawsuit in federal court which
claims that the city of Palo Alto is
violating the right of freedom of
association by enforcing certain
zoning laws against communes in
Palo Alto. Also, PATU was

involved in the recent Willow
Expressway hearings, as it will
continue to be in the future.
What is correct is that PATU has,
as an organization, stopped
attending rubber-stamp city
council meetings.
Most people in PATU believe
that "working through the
governmental structure" may or
may not be productive, depending
on the concrete situation. What is
not productive is to rely
exclusively on that structure,
which—as B.L. points out in his
editorial - has shown absolutely no
indication of being responsive to
the real housing needs of the
Mid-Peninsula.
The governmental structure,
whether at the local, state, or
federal level, is interested in such
profitable ventures as the "Willow
Expressway plan which would
destroy 433 units of housing in
the area," not in the economically
unsound task of satisfying
citizens' basic needs.
Thus, to rely exclusively or
even primarily on the
"governmental structures" would
be a big mistake. Only when we
start to take control of our own
lives, through our own peoples'
structures (such as PATU), will
the basic needs of all of us really
begin to be met.
Power to the people!

Dog Attack
Editor, The Daily:
On Sunday afternoon, October
25, 1970, my family and 1 were
leaving Tresidder Union when a
pack of five dogs swept through
us. One large short-haired black
clog in the pack bit my seven year
old son on the buttock. After 1
chased the pack out into the
Union court yard, I returned to
the front of the Union where my
wife and four year old son were
attending the seven year old son.
Before I realized what was
happening, the same pack of dogs
swept through again, knocked my
four year old son to the ground.

and the same large short-haired
black dog bit the four year old
son on the leg. This pack of five
dogs had been chased from inside
the Union only a few minutes
earlier. Both incidents were totally
unprovoked.
A campus policeman happened
by shortly after the incident. He
attempted to catch the one dog
that had done the biting, but he
would have been bitten also if he
had forcibly attempted to catch
the dog with his bare hands. At
this time, the policeman called the
county dog catcher, and 1 left to
carry my two sons to the hospital.
By some stroke of good luck
(after a sufficient supply of bad
luck for one day) both dog bites
had only scratched the skin.
After returning from the
hospital, I learned from the police
that the dog had not been
captured. Only then did 1 realize
how very lucky the children had
been in that the bites did not
puncture the skin. Can you
imagine telling your small children
that they must undergo the
extremely painful rabies
treatment that consists of
fourteen to twenty-one shots all
because someone was not
considerate enough to keep their
dog on a leash and the University
makes no overt attempt to
enforce the existing leash law. (It
should be noted that the
antirabies vaccine is not
universally effective and may give
rise to dangerous complications.
These complications may range
from local allergic reactions to
general paralysis.)
The above incident was
reported to the Daily on Sunday
afternoon in an attempt to get
some publicity for the serious dog
problem on campus. To this date,
nothing has appeared in the Daily.
Some people have figuratively
stated that Stanford is going to
the dogs. 1 believe that Stanford
has literally gone to the dogs. If
you agree with this, then please
make your feelings known to Hal
Wilson, university health officer
and also to President Lyman's
office.

Call To Violence?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the aftermath of the article
by D. McGuire published October
2, you voted to carry the
responsibility to prevent future
publication of calls for specific
acts of violence.
On Friday, October 30, the
heading to your letters column
carried S. Krute's cartoon call for
fire bombing the Bank of
America. The cartoon clearly
shows the Palo Alto area as the
location, gasoline in a Coke bottle
as the instrument and B of A as
the target. To my mind these are
specific enough to show that for
you the responsibility you took
up in early October did not last
out the month.
I'm sure that you can stretch
your concept of Free speech to
cover Krute's cute cartoon, but
please remember Wisconsin and
Isla Vista as you do.
Yours in peace and
non-violence.

imagine telling your small children
that they must undergo the
extremely painful rabies
treatment that consists of
fourteen to twenty-one shots all
because someone was not
considerate enough to keep their
dog on a leash and the University
makes no overt attempt to
enforce the existing leash law. (It
should be noted that the
antirabies vaccine is not
universally effective and may give
rise to dangerous complications.
These complications may range
from local allergic reactions to
general paralysis.)
The above incident was
reported to the Daily on Sunday
afternoon in an attempt to get
some publicity for the serious dog
problem on campus. To this date,
nothing has appeared in the Daily.
Some people have figuratively
stated that Stanford is going to
the dogs. 1 believe that Stanford
has literally gone to the dogs. If
you agree with this, then please
make your feelings known to Hal
Wilson, university health officer
and also to President Lyman's
office.

Call To Violence?
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the aftermath of the article
by D. McGuire published October
2, you voted to carry the
responsibility to prevent future
publication of calls for specific
acts of violence.
On Friday, October 30, the
heading to your letters column
carried S. Krute's cartoon call for
fire bombing the Bank of
America. The cartoon clearly
shows the Palo Alto area as the
location, gasoline in a Coke bottle
as the instrument and B of A as
the target. To my mind these are
specific enough to show that for
you the responsibility you took
up in early October did not last
out the month.
I'm sure that you can stretch
your concept of Free speech to
cover Krute's cute cartoon, but
please remember Wisconsin and
Isla Vista as you do.
Yours in peace and
non-violence.

My dear Prof. Franklin:
Glad you finally noticed my
secret instructions to you.
Congratulations; the logo first ran
5 months ago. Why haven't you
carried out my orders yet?
You did miss one point,
however. 1 do not call for, nor
condone in any way, the
destruction of a Bank of America.
I do, however, wholeheartedly
endorse any means by which
copies of the Palo Alto Times can
be ecologically erased.
Yours in poopadoodle,
Stan Krute
