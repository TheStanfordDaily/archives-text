# Funds Available For Ecology Study
## 
### 
A new program was announced
by the National Science
Foundation earlier this year to
encourage interdisciplinary effort
on the part of undergraduate and
graduate students who are
concerned about the deterioration
of the environment and who
would like to do something
concrete about it.
The program, "Student
Originated Studies," is being
funded for one million dollars for
the current fiscal year and
provides for groups of 5 to 15
undergraduate and some graduate
students to conduct research on
problems of their own choosing
related to the environment
physical, biological, and/or social.
The projects are to be originated,
planned, and directed by students,
with one student acting as the
project director similar to the role
of faculty principal investigator in
faculty-originated research
projects.
The projects are to be planned
to occupy fully the time of the
student investigators for an
uninterrupted period of 10 to 1 2
weeks, hence most projects will be
conducted during the summer.
Proposals for this first

competition must be received by
NSF no later than November 30,
1 970 , with the awards being
announced sometime after
mid-February, 1971. It is
anticipated that there will be as
many as 8 0 project teams selected
throughout the nation.
Students will receive stipends
of up to 80 dollars per week, and
9ome funds will be granted to
cover other costs incurred. At
least one group on this campus
has already formed a team and has
written a proposal to NSF—a
group of students in the Civil
Engineering Department studying
a solid waste disposal scheme.
This information has been
supplied by the Committee on
Alternate Sources of Research
Funding of the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, a
group of concerned students and
faculty who have been working
together since last May in search
of alternatives to the Defense
Department as a source of funding
on this campus.
The committee has been given
some funds with which to
supplement the grants of any
successful proposal team involving
engineering students.

FCC'S MAVERICK—NichoIas Johnson, outspoken and
unconventional FCC Commissioner and author of such speeches as
"For Whom Does Bell Toil?", spoke to the students of
Communications 225 A on Saturday. Johnson, a sharp critic of the
broadcast industry and of AT&T, discussed possible means of
regulating commercial broadcast stations. He also described the
substratum of the communications industry, where, he said, most of
the industry's power lie.

FCC'S MAVERICK—NichoIas Johnson, outspoken and
unconventional FCC Commissioner and author of such speeches as
"For Whom Does Bell Toil?", spoke to the students of
Communications 225 A on Saturday. Johnson, a sharp critic of the
broadcast industry and of AT&T, discussed possible means of
regulating commercial broadcast stations. He also described the
substratum of the communications industry, where, he said, most of
the industry's power lie.
A new program was announced
by the National Science
Foundation earlier this year to
encourage interdisciplinary effort
on the part of undergraduate and
graduate students who are
concerned about the deterioration
of the environment and who
would like to do something
concrete about it.
The program, "Student
Originated Studies," is being
funded for one million dollars for
the current fiscal year and
provides for groups of 5 to 15
undergraduate and some graduate
students to conduct research on
problems of their own choosing
related to the environment
physical, biological, and/or social.
The projects are to be originated,
planned, and directed by students,
with one student acting as the
project director similar to the role
of faculty principal investigator in
faculty-originated research
projects.
The projects are to be planned
to occupy fully the time of the
student investigators for an
uninterrupted period of 10 to 1 2
weeks, hence most projects will be
conducted during the summer.
Proposals for this first

competition must be received by
NSF no later than November 30,
1 970 , with the awards being
announced sometime after
mid-February, 1971. It is
anticipated that there will be as
many as 8 0 project teams selected
throughout the nation.
Students will receive stipends
of up to 80 dollars per week, and
9ome funds will be granted to
cover other costs incurred. At
least one group on this campus
has already formed a team and has
written a proposal to NSF—a
group of students in the Civil
Engineering Department studying
a solid waste disposal scheme.
This information has been
supplied by the Committee on
Alternate Sources of Research
Funding of the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics, a
group of concerned students and
faculty who have been working
together since last May in search
of alternatives to the Defense
Department as a source of funding
on this campus.
The committee has been given
some funds with which to
supplement the grants of any
successful proposal team involving
engineering students.
