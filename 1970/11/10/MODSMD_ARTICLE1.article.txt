# No Suspects, Leads Found In Behavioral Center Fire
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Early on the morning of April 24,
1970, in the foothills above Stanford,
arsonists set three fires at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences. Monetary losses came to over
$100,000, but a greater loss was the
destruction of the research work of ten
fellows lost in the damaged offices.
Hardest hit was Dr. M.N. Srinivas, an
Indian sociologist, who lost data crucial
to a 20-year study he was finishing on
an Indian village.
The only suspects were several
motorcyclists who had been seen in the
area during the previous few days. They
turned out to be student firemen who
had been patrolling the Center and the
campus to avert exactly the kind of
incident that occurred.
Since that time there have been few
substantive leads, and six months later
authorities are no closer to finding any
suspects.
Santa Clara County Fire Marshall,
John Baker, handled the investigation.
He says his department is no longer
actively working on it. "We have not
determined who any of the people
involved were, but the file is not closed.
We carried out a complete
investigation, but we failed to come up
with any real leads."

When questioned about his hopes of
solving the crime, Baker was not
optimistic. "Some you solve and some
you don't. In this kind of an arson
attack it's hard to come up with any
suspects."
In addition to having no suspects,
the authorities still have no definite
motive. Said Baker, "I still can't see
why anyone would want to hit a place
like the Center."
The Director of the Center, Dr. O.
Meredith Wilson, former president of
the University of Minnesota, is as
uncertain as anyone about the motives
of the attack. "I can hardly believe that
any person educated to the purpose of
the Center could be bent on its
destruction."
Not War-Related
The Center, which is funded mainly
by the Ford Foundation, is for
"distinguished scholars to study, write,
reflect, or hold seminars together,"
according to a letter sent to prospective
fellows.
Running down the Center's list of
financial backers, Wilson claimed that
none were actively involved in any
war-related or major Defense
Department work. He also didn't feel
that any of the backers or any of the

directors had previously been major
targets of radical terrorism.
Wilson went on to discuss the theory
that the attack had been directed at
someone working at the Center. Most
of those who had thought it was a
personal attack felt that it was directed
towards Dr. John Bunzel, former
chairman of the political science
department at San Francisco State
College, now president of San Jose
State College. In 1969 , after refusing to
support a student strike at S.F. State,
and after criticizing Black Studies
Department Chairman Dr. Nathan
Hare, Bunzel was a frequent target of
violent radical attacks.

it was hit by arsonists last spring. It has since been rebuilt.
Wilson and most others today
discredit this idea. Bunzel's office was
damaged but the firebombs did not
seem to be directly aimed at his office.
Furthermore, most people feel that an
attack on Bunzel would more likely
have been directed towards his person
or his home. And those offices most
heavily damaged were occupied by
unlikely radical targets, among them
Srinivas and Sol Tax, a University of
Chicago anthropologist noted for his
sympathies for the American Indian.
To back up this rationalization,
Wilson cited an editorial in the
Berkeley Barb which criticized the

attackers for hitting the wrong place
and the wrong people.

associates the incident with the turmoil
on the Stanford campus at the time.
This theory seems to be most widely
held by people at the Center and by
investigating authorities.

people occupied the Old Union in an

morning of the 24 th, 13 people were
arrested at the Old Union. Following
the arrests, street fighting broke out.

firebombings may have been directly

The Center, which is funded mainly
by the Ford Foundation, is for
"distinguished scholars to study, write,
reflect, or hold seminars together,"
according to a letter sent to prospective
fellows.
Running down the Center's list of
financial backers, Wilson claimed that
none were actively involved in any
war-related or major Defense
Department work. He also didn't feel
that any of the backers or any of the

directors had previously been major
targets of radical terrorism.
Wilson went on to discuss the theory
that the attack had been directed at
someone working at the Center. Most
of those who had thought it was a
personal attack felt that it was directed
towards Dr. John Bunzel, former
chairman of the political science
department at San Francisco State
College, now president of San Jose
State College. In 1969 , after refusing to
support a student strike at S.F. State,
and after criticizing Black Studies
Department Chairman Dr. Nathan
Hare, Bunzel was a frequent target of
violent radical attacks.

AFTERMATH—This smoldering wreckage is the remains of one wing of the Center for the Study of Behavioral Sciences after
it was hit by arsonists last spring. It has since been rebuilt.
Wilson and most others today
discredit this idea. Bunzel's office was
damaged but the firebombs did not
seem to be directly aimed at his office.
Furthermore, most people feel that an
attack on Bunzel would more likely
have been directed towards his person
or his home. And those offices most
heavily damaged were occupied by
unlikely radical targets, among them
Srinivas and Sol Tax, a University of
Chicago anthropologist noted for his
sympathies for the American Indian.
To back up this rationalization,
Wilson cited an editorial in the
Berkeley Barb which criticized the

attackers for hitting the wrong place
and the wrong people.
The main theory remaining
associates the incident with the turmoil
on the Stanford campus at the time.
This theory seems to be most widely
held by people at the Center and by
investigating authorities.
On the afternoon of April 23, 460
people occupied the Old Union in an
anti-ROTC sit-in. At 1:10 a.m. on the
morning of the 24 th, 13 people were
arrested at the Old Union. Following
the arrests, street fighting broke out.
Wilson feels that the Center
firebombings may have been directly
related to this earlier violence.
Early on the morning of April 24,
1970, in the foothills above Stanford,
arsonists set three fires at the Center
for Advanced Study in the Behavioral
Sciences. Monetary losses came to over
$100,000, but a greater loss was the
destruction of the research work of ten
fellows lost in the damaged offices.
Hardest hit was Dr. M.N. Srinivas, an
Indian sociologist, who lost data crucial
to a 20-year study he was finishing on
an Indian village.
The only suspects were several
motorcyclists who had been seen in the
area during the previous few days. They
turned out to be student firemen who
had been patrolling the Center and the
campus to avert exactly the kind of
incident that occurred.
Since that time there have been few
substantive leads, and six months later
authorities are no closer to finding any
suspects.
Santa Clara County Fire Marshall,
John Baker, handled the investigation.
He says his department is no longer
actively working on it. "We have not
determined who any of the people
involved were, but the file is not closed.
We carried out a complete
investigation, but we failed to come up
with any real leads."

When questioned about his hopes of
solving the crime, Baker was not
optimistic. "Some you solve and some
you don't. In this kind of an arson
attack it's hard to come up with any
suspects."
In addition to having no suspects,
the authorities still have no definite
motive. Said Baker, "I still can't see
why anyone would want to hit a place
like the Center."
The Director of the Center, Dr. O.
Meredith Wilson, former president of
the University of Minnesota, is as

Chicago anthropologist noted for his
sympathies for the American Indian.
To back up this rationalization,
Wilson cited an editorial in the
Berkeley Barb which criticized the

attackers for hitting the wrong place
and the wrong people.
The main theory remaining
associates the incident with the turmoil
on the Stanford campus at the time.
This theory seems to be most widely
held by people at the Center and by
investigating authorities.
On the afternoon of April 23, 460
people occupied the Old Union in an
anti-ROTC sit-in. At 1:10 a.m. on the
morning of the 24 th, 13 people were
arrested at the Old Union. Following
the arrests, street fighting broke out.
Wilson feels that the Center
firebombings may have been directly
related to this earlier violence.
