## Tommy The 'Bum' 
### 
TJ was a radical, an almost fanatical believer in
man's right to exercise control over the powerful
forces which shape his existance. His political
thinking was fraught with fears of the harm that
remote and powerful aristocratic government
could do to a people and a country.
Lanky and big-boned, TJ, who wore his
sandy-brown hair tied in a pigtail behind his head,
was often sloppily dressed. He seemed to
deliberately "dress down" on certain occasions.
But amidst his unorganized appearance, his eyes
shone with a keen intensity indicative of his
shrewd and piercing intellect.
You couldn't help but respect the man. His
analyses were quick and accurate; his thinking
revealed a broad education and a heartfelt
understanding of the human condition, a
condition he radiated a sincere and overwhelming
desire to improve.
But TJ was not so much of the idealistic
philosopher that he did not realize that in order to
attain certain levels of human accomplishment
some moral guideposts might have to beset aside.
He knew that, presented no new challenge, a
prizefighter loses his edge, and that by the time he
is once again called upon to utilize his skills, he
may have grown old and his reflexes and muscle
tone might not be what they once were.
It was to this end that he wrote, in a letter to a

- jesse cedarbaum

friend, "A little rebellion now and then is a good
thing ... It is a medicine necessary to the sound
functioning of government."
And, in yet another letter, "What country
before ever existed a century and a half without a
rebellion? God forbid we should be twenty years
with (one) ... The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."
When TJ wrote these words, he was not in the
course of advocating or propagating a revolution.
Indeed, it was a scant 1 0 years before that he had
immortalized on parchment the call to one of the
most significant rebellions history has known.
Yet in his wisdom, TJ knew that the process of
change is an ongoing one, that the revolution he
and others had instituted was not an end in itself,
but rather a beginning.
It is rather a credit to TJ and his
contemporaries that the institutions they
established have persisted for a century and a half
without the necessity of intensely resurrected
challenge. But it is a greater credit to TJ that he
recognized the fallibility his creation and the value
of criticism of an intense and rebellious nature.
it is indeed a shame that the tradition TJ began
is becoming as obsolescent as the two-dollar bills
on which his visage once appeared.

some moral guideposts might have to beset aside.
He knew that, presented no new challenge, a
prizefighter loses his edge, and that by the time he
is once again called upon to utilize his skills, he

friend, "A little rebellion now and then is a good
thing ... It is a medicine necessary to the sound
functioning of government."
And, in yet another letter, "What country
before ever existed a century and a half without a
rebellion? God forbid we should be twenty years
with (one) ... The tree of liberty must be
refreshed from time to time with the blood of
patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."
When TJ wrote these words, he was not in the
course of advocating or propagating a revolution.
Indeed, it was a scant 1 0 years before that he had
immortalized on parchment the call to one of the
most significant rebellions history has known.
Yet in his wisdom, TJ knew that the process of
change is an ongoing one, that the revolution he
and others had instituted was not an end in itself,
but rather a beginning.
It is rather a credit to TJ and his
contemporaries that the institutions they
established have persisted for a century and a half
without the necessity of intensely resurrected
challenge. But it is a greater credit to TJ that he
recognized the fallibility his creation and the value
of criticism of an intense and rebellious nature.
it is indeed a shame that the tradition TJ began
is becoming as obsolescent as the two-dollar bills
on which his visage once appeared.

TJ was a radical, an almost fanatical believer in
man's right to exercise control over the powerful
forces which shape his existance. His political
thinking was fraught with fears of the harm that
remote and powerful aristocratic government
could do to a people and a country.
Lanky and big-boned, TJ, who wore his
sandy-brown hair tied in a pigtail behind his head,
was often sloppily dressed. He seemed to
deliberately "dress down" on certain occasions.
But amidst his unorganized appearance, his eyes
shone with a keen intensity indicative of his
shrewd and piercing intellect.
You couldn't help but respect the man. His
analyses were quick and accurate; his thinking
revealed a broad education and a heartfelt
understanding of the human condition, a
condition he radiated a sincere and overwhelming
desire to improve.
But TJ was not so much of the idealistic
philosopher that he did not realize that in order to
attain certain levels of human accomplishment
some moral guideposts might have to beset aside.
