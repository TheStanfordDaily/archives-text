# Thefts More Disturbing
## 'Purge War Criminals'â€” Scheer Says 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"Anyone working as a war
criminal should be...purged from
the community," Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom Party
Senatorial candidate in last week's
election, told the "War Crimes
Commission" Sunday night.
The mock hearing on
"genocide in Southeast Asia" held
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
initiated what an organizer called
"along series of hearings on war
crimes and war complicity at
Stanford."
Scheer's definition of war
criminals included all those who
work in support of U.S. war
efforts and foreign policy.
The crowd of about 200,
which New Left Project sponsors
described as a disappointing
turnout, heard Scheer explain,
"The sharpie social scientist who
figures out how to hustle people's
minds is no better than the one
who figures out how to burn their
bodies."
Katherine Barkley of the New
Left Project said volunteers would
investigate "war crimes" at
Stanford and surrounding
communities and present results
at future Commission "hearings."
About fifty people filled out
index cards volunteering as
investigators. A meeting of those
interested in the Commission is
planned for tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Grove-Hurlburt lounge.
Build a Movement
In an interview, Miss
Barkley said the New Left Project
"hopes to build a movement for
this year" from interest in the
hearings which are patterned after
a radical project at Berkeley.
Scheer, who was editor of
"Ramparts Magazine" for five
years, said Nuremberg War Trial
definitions of war crimes must be
expanded to create a "an
alternative, revolutionary legal
framework.
"The very act of waging war
against a people's war is in itself a
war crime. The very foreign policy
of the United States is criminal."
Scheer admitted a Commission
"indicting" specific local business
and academic leaders may seem to
be a radical version of Senator

Joseph McCarthy's "witch hunts,"
but said, "1 don't want to see
people able to (use) college
tranquility to be able to destroy
people."
As part of the investigation,
Scheer said, "We should break
into (professors') files and offices
and get the facts....We obviously
have to use any means necessary
to get the facts."

Fighting against U.S.
"genocide" has created "a new
man, a new woman" in the
"cultural revolutions" of
countries such as North Vietnam,
North Korea, and Communist
China," according to Scheer.
Scheer visited those countries
this summer on an "Asian tour"
led by exiled Black Panther
Eldridge Cleaver.

destroyed over "fifty per cent of
the arable land," and said tear and
nausea gases are used in extreme
concentration to flush out
civilians who are then shot.
Truskier described a peasant he
met in Hanoi. The scarred,
deformed, partially paralyzed man
had been napalmed by U.S.
planes.
He said civilian massacres such
as that alleged at My Lai are not
isolated.
Torture of prisoners captured
by the U.S. includes what soldiers
call the "Bell Telephone Hour,"
electrically shocking a prisoner by
attaching wires from a field
telephone generator to his
fingertips, mouth, or genitals.
Truskier claimed that President
Nixon's troop withdrawals are a
trick to make it politically
possible for the "genocidal" effort
to continue for years with greater
firepower and more sophisticated
technology.
Relating Truskier's charges to
Stanford, Miss Barkley alleged
new infrared devices to spot
traffic on the Ho Chi Min TTail
were developed by Stanford
Research Institute, formerly
owned by Stanford.

And she said former President
Kenneth Pitzer helped "decide to
use" napalm while a Harvard
chemist.
Forced Urbanization
Earl Martin, who worked in a
volunteer project in South
Vietnam for three years, described
the U.S. "forced urbanization
policy."
He depicted the traditional
Vietnamese village as a "garden of
Eden, harmoniously blending with
nature."
But he said he saw U.S. troops
move villagers to bleak urban
areas where Viet Cong activity can
be prevented.
Speaking in a softer, but more
emotional voice than the other,
Martin described 6,000 troops
surrounding a series of villages.
The citizens were loaded into
helicopters and flown seven miles
to a "bleak riverside" where
11,000 people from different
villages were imprisoned in a city
surrounded by barbed wire.
Martin said insensitive
American officials described the
refugee camps as a "modernizing
experience" because they
substituted tin roofs for thatch.

Vietnamese village as a "garden of
Eden, harmoniously blending with
nature."
But he said he saw U.S. troops
move villagers to bleak urban
areas where Viet Cong activity can
be prevented.
Speaking in a softer, but more
emotional voice than the other,
Martin described 6,000 troops
surrounding a series of villages.
The citizens were loaded into
helicopters and flown seven miles
to a "bleak riverside" where
11,000 people from different
villages were imprisoned in a city
surrounded by barbed wire.
Martin said insensitive
American officials described the
refugee camps as a "modernizing
experience" because they
substituted tin roofs for thatch.
"Anyone working as a war
criminal should be...purged from
the community," Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom Party
Senatorial candidate in last week's
election, told the "War Crimes
Commission" Sunday night.
The mock hearing on
"genocide in Southeast Asia" held
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
initiated what an organizer called
"along series of hearings on war
crimes and war complicity at
Stanford."
Scheer's definition of war
criminals included all those who
work in support of U.S. war
efforts and foreign policy.
The crowd of about 200,
which New Left Project sponsors
described as a disappointing
turnout, heard Scheer explain,
"The sharpie social scientist who
figures out how to hustle people's
minds is no better than the one
who figures out how to burn their
bodies."
Katherine Barkley of the New
Left Project said volunteers would
investigate "war crimes" at
Stanford and surrounding
communities and present results
at future Commission "hearings."
About fifty people filled out
index cards volunteering as
investigators. A meeting of those
interested in the Commission is
planned for tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Grove-Hurlburt lounge.
Build a Movement
In an interview, Miss
Barkley said the New Left Project
"hopes to build a movement for
this year" from interest in the
hearings which are patterned after
a radical project at Berkeley.
Scheer, who was editor of
"Ramparts Magazine" for five
years, said Nuremberg War Trial
definitions of war crimes must be
expanded to create a "an
alternative, revolutionary legal
framework.
"The very act of waging war
against a people's war is in itself a
war crime. The very foreign policy
of the United States is criminal."
Scheer admitted a Commission
"indicting" specific local business
and academic leaders may seem to
be a radical version of Senator

Joseph McCarthy's "witch hunts,"
but said, "1 don't want to see
people able to (use) college
tranquility to be able to destroy
people."
As part of the investigation,
Scheer said, "We should break
into (professors') files and offices
and get the facts....We obviously
have to use any means necessary
to get the facts."

Fighting against U.S.
"genocide" has created "a new
man, a new woman" in the
"cultural revolutions" of
countries such as North Vietnam,
North Korea, and Communist
China," according to Scheer.
Scheer visited those countries
this summer on an "Asian tour"
led by exiled Black Panther
Eldridge Cleaver.

the arable land," and said tear and
nausea gases are used in extreme
concentration to flush out
civilians who are then shot.
Truskier described a peasant he
met in Hanoi. The scarred,
deformed, partially paralyzed man
had been napalmed by U.S.
planes.
He said civilian massacres such
as that alleged at My Lai are not
isolated.
Torture of prisoners captured
by the U.S. includes what soldiers
call the "Bell Telephone Hour,"
electrically shocking a prisoner by
attaching wires from a field
telephone generator to his
fingertips, mouth, or genitals.
Truskier claimed that President
Nixon's troop withdrawals are a
trick to make it politically
possible for the "genocidal" effort
to continue for years with greater
firepower and more sophisticated
technology.
Relating Truskier's charges to
Stanford, Miss Barkley alleged
new infrared devices to spot
traffic on the Ho Chi Min TTail
were developed by Stanford
Research Institute, formerly
owned by Stanford.

And she said former President
Kenneth Pitzer helped "decide to
use" napalm while a Harvard
chemist.
Forced Urbanization
Earl Martin, who worked in a
volunteer project in South
Vietnam for three years, described
the U.S. "forced urbanization
policy."

possible for the "genocidal" effort
to continue for years with greater
firepower and more sophisticated
technology.
Relating Truskier's charges to
Stanford, Miss Barkley alleged
new infrared devices to spot
traffic on the Ho Chi Min TTail
were developed by Stanford
Research Institute, formerly
owned by Stanford.

And she said former President
Kenneth Pitzer helped "decide to
use" napalm while a Harvard
chemist.
Forced Urbanization
Earl Martin, who worked in a
volunteer project in South
Vietnam for three years, described
the U.S. "forced urbanization
policy."
He depicted the traditional
Vietnamese village as a "garden of
Eden, harmoniously blending with
nature."
But he said he saw U.S. troops
move villagers to bleak urban
areas where Viet Cong activity can
be prevented.
Speaking in a softer, but more
emotional voice than the other,
Martin described 6,000 troops
surrounding a series of villages.
The citizens were loaded into
helicopters and flown seven miles
to a "bleak riverside" where
11,000 people from different
villages were imprisoned in a city
surrounded by barbed wire.
Martin said insensitive
American officials described the
refugee camps as a "modernizing
experience" because they
substituted tin roofs for thatch.
"Anyone working as a war
criminal should be...purged from
the community," Robert Scheer,
Peace and Freedom Party
Senatorial candidate in last week's
election, told the "War Crimes
Commission" Sunday night.
The mock hearing on
"genocide in Southeast Asia" held
at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
initiated what an organizer called
"along series of hearings on war
crimes and war complicity at
Stanford."
Scheer's definition of war
criminals included all those who
work in support of U.S. war
efforts and foreign policy.
The crowd of about 200,
which New Left Project sponsors
described as a disappointing
turnout, heard Scheer explain,
"The sharpie social scientist who
figures out how to hustle people's
minds is no better than the one
who figures out how to burn their
bodies."
Katherine Barkley of the New
Left Project said volunteers would
investigate "war crimes" at
Stanford and surrounding
communities and present results
at future Commission "hearings."
About fifty people filled out
index cards volunteering as
investigators. A meeting of those
interested in the Commission is
planned for tonight at 8 p.m. in
the Grove-Hurlburt lounge.
Build a Movement
In an interview, Miss
Barkley said the New Left Project
"hopes to build a movement for
this year" from interest in the
hearings which are patterned after
a radical project at Berkeley.
Scheer, who was editor of
"Ramparts Magazine" for five
years, said Nuremberg War Trial
definitions of war crimes must be
expanded to create a "an
alternative, revolutionary legal
framework.
"The very act of waging war
against a people's war is in itself a
war crime. The very foreign policy
of the United States is criminal."
Scheer admitted a Commission
"indicting" specific local business
and academic leaders may seem to
be a radical version of Senator

Joseph McCarthy's "witch hunts,"
but said, "1 don't want to see
people able to (use) college
tranquility to be able to destroy
people."
As part of the investigation,
Scheer said, "We should break
into (professors') files and offices
and get the facts....We obviously
have to use any means necessary
to get the facts."

Fighting against U.S.
"genocide" has created "a new
man, a new woman" in the
"cultural revolutions" of
countries such as North Vietnam,
North Korea, and Communist
China," according to Scheer.
Scheer visited those countries
this summer on an "Asian tour"
led by exiled Black Panther
Eldridge Cleaver.

destroyed over "fifty per cent of
the arable land," and said tear and
nausea gases are used in extreme
concentration to flush out
civilians who are then shot.
Truskier described a peasant he
met in Hanoi. The scarred,
deformed, partially paralyzed man
had been napalmed by U.S.
planes.
He said civilian massacres such
as that alleged at My Lai are not
isolated.
Torture of prisoners captured
by the U.S. includes what soldiers
call the "Bell Telephone Hour,"
electrically shocking a prisoner by
attaching wires from a field
telephone generator to his
fingertips, mouth, or genitals.
