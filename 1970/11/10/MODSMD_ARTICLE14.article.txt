# Police Don't Look For 'Pot' Violations
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
The general policy of the Stanford police is
not to go out looking for marijuana violations,
.Police Chief Thomas Bell said in a recent
interview with the Daily.
If in the course of their normal duties,
however, they come upon an infraction, an
arrest will be made, Bell added. -Since
marijuana possession is a felony, the individual
officer can not exercise his own discretion.
In Bell's judgment, a major problem with
hard drugs does not yet exist on the Stanford
campus. However information regarding the
limited heroin usage which does exist is turned
over to county and state authorities. Lacking
an undercover squad, Bell explained, the police
are not trained for this type of work and
would only interfere with state and federal
investigations.
According to Bell, students sometimes
anonymously notify police of drug use in their
dorms; however, there are only a few such calls
each month.

The information so received, said Bell, is
passed on to the dorm adviser who is asked to
handle the situation before a more serious
problem arises. If, however, the information
received pertains to heroin, the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department is notified and
conducts its own investigation. In the event
that outside police must come on campus to
make an arrest, University officials are notified
immediately. It's an oversight if they are not,
Bell claimed.
Although Stanford police do not make a
point of rounding up drug offenders among
Stanford students, Bell said that complaints
filed by parents whose high school students
return from campus stoned or drunk do
warrant police action. It is, however, up to the
citizen whether or not charges will be pressed.
Apparently, the effect of the University on
the drug problem in Palo Alto can not be
ascertained. "Marijuana is readily available and
there are many simple routes to pick it up,"

said Palo Alto police Chief William Hydie.
Only when a drug violation originates or
occurs within the Palo Alto city limits would
Palo Alto police become involved on campus.
Even then, says Hydie, any information they
obtain is turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department.
Although the Palo Alto police department
doesn't keep separate statistics on Stanford
students, they arrested 1 7 people on marijuana
violations in a three month period in 1969 and
31 during a similar period in 197 0, an increase
of 81 percent.
While the University is a private corporation
located in an unincorporated area of the
county, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office has the main responsibility for the
campus.
More thanwith dope violations, the Stanford
Police, says Bell, are primarily concerned with
the major increase in thefts on University
property.

campus. However information regarding the
limited heroin usage which does exist is turned
over to county and state authorities. Lacking
an undercover squad, Bell explained, the police
are not trained for this type of work and
would only interfere with state and federal
investigations.
According to Bell, students sometimes
anonymously notify police of drug use in their
dorms; however, there are only a few such calls
each month.

The information so received, said Bell, is
passed on to the dorm adviser who is asked to
handle the situation before a more serious
problem arises. If, however, the information
received pertains to heroin, the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department is notified and
conducts its own investigation. In the event
that outside police must come on campus to
make an arrest, University officials are notified
immediately. It's an oversight if they are not,
Bell claimed.
Although Stanford police do not make a
point of rounding up drug offenders among
Stanford students, Bell said that complaints
filed by parents whose high school students
return from campus stoned or drunk do
warrant police action. It is, however, up to the
citizen whether or not charges will be pressed.
Apparently, the effect of the University on
the drug problem in Palo Alto can not be
ascertained. "Marijuana is readily available and
there are many simple routes to pick it up,"

said Palo Alto police Chief William Hydie.
Only when a drug violation originates or
occurs within the Palo Alto city limits would
Palo Alto police become involved on campus.
Even then, says Hydie, any information they
obtain is turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department.
Although the Palo Alto police department
doesn't keep separate statistics on Stanford
students, they arrested 1 7 people on marijuana
violations in a three month period in 1969 and
31 during a similar period in 197 0, an increase
of 81 percent.
While the University is a private corporation
located in an unincorporated area of the
county, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office has the main responsibility for the
campus.
More thanwith dope violations, the Stanford
Police, says Bell, are primarily concerned with
the major increase in thefts on University
property.

The general policy of the Stanford police is
not to go out looking for marijuana violations,
.Police Chief Thomas Bell said in a recent
interview with the Daily.
If in the course of their normal duties,
however, they come upon an infraction, an
arrest will be made, Bell added. -Since
marijuana possession is a felony, the individual
officer can not exercise his own discretion.
In Bell's judgment, a major problem with
hard drugs does not yet exist on the Stanford
campus. However information regarding the
limited heroin usage which does exist is turned
over to county and state authorities. Lacking
an undercover squad, Bell explained, the police
are not trained for this type of work and

problem arises. If, however, the information
received pertains to heroin, the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department is notified and
conducts its own investigation. In the event
that outside police must come on campus to
make an arrest, University officials are notified
immediately. It's an oversight if they are not,
Bell claimed.
Although Stanford police do not make a
point of rounding up drug offenders among
Stanford students, Bell said that complaints
filed by parents whose high school students
return from campus stoned or drunk do
warrant police action. It is, however, up to the
citizen whether or not charges will be pressed.
Apparently, the effect of the University on
the drug problem in Palo Alto can not be
ascertained. "Marijuana is readily available and
there are many simple routes to pick it up,"

said Palo Alto police Chief William Hydie.
Only when a drug violation originates or
occurs within the Palo Alto city limits would
Palo Alto police become involved on campus.
Even then, says Hydie, any information they
obtain is turned over to the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department.
Although the Palo Alto police department
doesn't keep separate statistics on Stanford
students, they arrested 1 7 people on marijuana
violations in a three month period in 1969 and
31 during a similar period in 197 0, an increase
of 81 percent.
While the University is a private corporation
located in an unincorporated area of the
county, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office has the main responsibility for the
campus.
More thanwith dope violations, the Stanford
Police, says Bell, are primarily concerned with
the major increase in thefts on University
property.

The general policy of the Stanford police is
not to go out looking for marijuana violations,
.Police Chief Thomas Bell said in a recent
interview with the Daily.
If in the course of their normal duties,
however, they come upon an infraction, an
arrest will be made, Bell added. -Since
marijuana possession is a felony, the individual
officer can not exercise his own discretion.
In Bell's judgment, a major problem with
hard drugs does not yet exist on the Stanford
campus. However information regarding the
limited heroin usage which does exist is turned
over to county and state authorities. Lacking
an undercover squad, Bell explained, the police
are not trained for this type of work and
would only interfere with state and federal
investigations.
According to Bell, students sometimes
anonymously notify police of drug use in their
dorms; however, there are only a few such calls
each month.

The information so received, said Bell, is
passed on to the dorm adviser who is asked to
handle the situation before a more serious
problem arises. If, however, the information
received pertains to heroin, the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department is notified and
conducts its own investigation. In the event
that outside police must come on campus to
make an arrest, University officials are notified
