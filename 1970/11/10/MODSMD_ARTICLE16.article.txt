# Doctors' Aide Plan, Computerized Care Among Medical Center Innovations
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
A program to train
doctors'aides in an effort to
expand the delivery of family
health care and alleviate the
doctor shortage, will begin in
January at the University Medical
Center.
The project grew out of a
program to rechannel medical
corpsmen into civilian health care,
and another aimed at giving
qualified minority people
opportunities in medical careers,
an area that has been previously
closed to them.
Candidates for the course can
be high school graduates with
some additional training or
college. Already 210 applications
have been received for 30 spaces
in the initial class. If new funding
plans fail, only eight will be
chosen for the first program.
According to Dr. Michael
Dennis, program director, there
are many qualified candidates.
"There are a lot of bright,
dedicated men who have had
medical corpsmen training, but
because of the structure of
medical education, they just
haven't been able to continue
their medical career. With the
younger fellows, financial
difficulties and continuing
discrimination have put up real
entrance barriers to their getting
started." A number of nurses who
are eager for more responsibility
have also applied.
Two Prong Program
The program has two phases.
The first is the equivalent of
nursing or medical corpsmen
training, aiming to create in 12
months a civilian corpsman who
can handle a variety of medical
emergencies.
The second phase is a
15-month course including four
months of formal teaching and 11

(months of apprenticeship to a
general practitioner.
The California Board of
Medical Examiners will set
guidelines to determine what the
graduates of the course will
actually be allowed to do. Dr.
Dennis hopes that the aides will
be able to help deliver babies and
to cover for doctors in nursing
homes. Graduates will work in
areas with severe doctor shortages
such as East Palo Alto and rural
communities in California.
The Medical Center also
announced several technological
innovations to improve health
care in the future.
A major new research center to
exploit the revolutionary
technology of integrated
electronics for use in medical care
is being set up here under a
$25 0,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW).
Researchers from the schools
of Engineering and Medicine
will work together in the five-year,
$1.7 million program. Electrical
Engineering Professor James D.
Meindl, integrated circuit expert,
will direct the program.
Electronics Innovation
Integrated electronics, which
has already changed the
electronics industry, is a kind of
super-miniaturization of
electronic devices such as radios
and computers. For example, a
silicon chip smaller than a
fingernail serves as a radio and a
three-inch silicon wafer can hold
almost the entire electronics of a
computer.
Such complex, yet minuscule
electronic devices suggest
dramatic new possibilities for
medical use, especially if
implanted within the body,
according to Meindl.
Other new developments
involve the use of computers. A

computer has been keeping tabs
on dangerous bacteria and helping
select which antibiotic drugs
should be used to treat infections
for the last 10 months at the
Medical Center.
Knowing which of the
different antibiotics are active or
inactive against various
micro-organisms helps doctors
prescribe the right treatment for
patients, but standard tests are
completely accurate.
Computer Control
"Computer quality control
improves the reliability of such
tests," researchers emphasize,
"and results in improved
diagnosis, timelier treatment, and
far less medical paper work."
In another area, a
computerized blook bank system,
which can give medical personnel
instant access to information
about donors and related clinical
data, has been designed by
University scientists.

A person without computer
programming experience can use
the computer to choose available
donors with just the right blood
type, and print out the names of
people to be contacted in an
emergency or when the blood
bank's inventory is low.
Ten per cent of the blood
supply in the Stanford bank
becomes outdated before it is
used, but the use of the computer
in keeping accurate inventory is
expected to reduce the loss to less
than five per cent. The system will
also be useful in cross-matching
and preparing components of
blood.
Dr. Paul Wolf, associate
professor of pathology and
director of clinical laboratories
and the blood bank at the
University Medical Center, and
Drs. Herbert R. Ludwig and
Jacques Vallee of the
Computation Center, developed
the system.

expand the delivery of family
health care and alleviate the
doctor shortage, will begin in
January at the University Medical
Center.
The project grew out of a
program to rechannel medical
corpsmen into civilian health care,
and another aimed at giving
qualified minority people
opportunities in medical careers,
an area that has been previously
closed to them.
Candidates for the course can
be high school graduates with
some additional training or
college. Already 210 applications
have been received for 30 spaces
in the initial class. If new funding
plans fail, only eight will be
chosen for the first program.
According to Dr. Michael
Dennis, program director, there
are many qualified candidates.
"There are a lot of bright,
dedicated men who have had
medical corpsmen training, but
because of the structure of
medical education, they just
haven't been able to continue
their medical career. With the
younger fellows, financial
difficulties and continuing
discrimination have put up real
entrance barriers to their getting
started." A number of nurses who
are eager for more responsibility
have also applied.
Two Prong Program
The program has two phases.
The first is the equivalent of
nursing or medical corpsmen
training, aiming to create in 12
months a civilian corpsman who
can handle a variety of medical
emergencies.
The second phase is a
15-month course including four
months of formal teaching and 11

(months of apprenticeship to a
general practitioner.
The California Board of
Medical Examiners will set
guidelines to determine what the
graduates of the course will
actually be allowed to do. Dr.
Dennis hopes that the aides will
be able to help deliver babies and
to cover for doctors in nursing
homes. Graduates will work in
areas with severe doctor shortages
such as East Palo Alto and rural
communities in California.
The Medical Center also
announced several technological
innovations to improve health
care in the future.
A major new research center to
exploit the revolutionary
technology of integrated
electronics for use in medical care
is being set up here under a
$25 0,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW).
Researchers from the schools
of Engineering and Medicine
will work together in the five-year,
$1.7 million program. Electrical
Engineering Professor James D.
Meindl, integrated circuit expert,
will direct the program.
Electronics Innovation
Integrated electronics, which
has already changed the
electronics industry, is a kind of
super-miniaturization of
electronic devices such as radios
and computers. For example, a
silicon chip smaller than a
fingernail serves as a radio and a
three-inch silicon wafer can hold
almost the entire electronics of a
computer.
Such complex, yet minuscule
electronic devices suggest
dramatic new possibilities for
medical use, especially if
implanted within the body,
according to Meindl.
Other new developments
involve the use of computers. A

computer has been keeping tabs
on dangerous bacteria and helping
select which antibiotic drugs
should be used to treat infections
for the last 10 months at the
Medical Center.
Knowing which of the
different antibiotics are active or
inactive against various
micro-organisms helps doctors
prescribe the right treatment for
patients, but standard tests are
completely accurate.
Computer Control
"Computer quality control
improves the reliability of such
tests," researchers emphasize,
"and results in improved
diagnosis, timelier treatment, and
far less medical paper work."
In another area, a
computerized blook bank system,
which can give medical personnel
instant access to information
about donors and related clinical
data, has been designed by
University scientists.

A person without computer
programming experience can use
the computer to choose available
donors with just the right blood
type, and print out the names of
people to be contacted in an
emergency or when the blood
bank's inventory is low.
Ten per cent of the blood
supply in the Stanford bank
becomes outdated before it is
used, but the use of the computer
in keeping accurate inventory is
expected to reduce the loss to less
than five per cent. The system will
also be useful in cross-matching
and preparing components of
blood.
Dr. Paul Wolf, associate
professor of pathology and
director of clinical laboratories
and the blood bank at the
University Medical Center, and
Drs. Herbert R. Ludwig and
Jacques Vallee of the
Computation Center, developed
the system.

The project grew out of a
program to rechannel medical
corpsmen into civilian health care,
and another aimed at giving
qualified minority people
opportunities in medical careers,
an area that has been previously
closed to them.
Candidates for the course can
be high school graduates with
some additional training or
college. Already 210 applications
have been received for 30 spaces
in the initial class. If new funding
plans fail, only eight will be
chosen for the first program.
According to Dr. Michael
Dennis, program director, there
are many qualified candidates.
"There are a lot of bright,
dedicated men who have had
medical corpsmen training, but
because of the structure of
medical education, they just
haven't been able to continue
their medical career. With the
younger fellows, financial
difficulties and continuing
discrimination have put up real
entrance barriers to their getting
started." A number of nurses who
are eager for more responsibility
have also applied.
Two Prong Program
The program has two phases.
The first is the equivalent of
nursing or medical corpsmen
training, aiming to create in 12
months a civilian corpsman who
can handle a variety of medical
emergencies.
The second phase is a
15-month course including four
months of formal teaching and 11

(months of apprenticeship to a
general practitioner.
The California Board of
Medical Examiners will set
guidelines to determine what the
graduates of the course will
actually be allowed to do. Dr.
Dennis hopes that the aides will
be able to help deliver babies and
to cover for doctors in nursing
homes. Graduates will work in
areas with severe doctor shortages
such as East Palo Alto and rural
communities in California.
The Medical Center also
announced several technological
innovations to improve health
care in the future.
A major new research center to
exploit the revolutionary
technology of integrated
electronics for use in medical care
is being set up here under a
$25 0,000 grant from the U.S.
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare (HEW).
Researchers from the schools
of Engineering and Medicine
will work together in the five-year,
$1.7 million program. Electrical
Engineering Professor James D.
Meindl, integrated circuit expert,
will direct the program.
Electronics Innovation
Integrated electronics, which
has already changed the
electronics industry, is a kind of
super-miniaturization of
electronic devices such as radios
and computers. For example, a
silicon chip smaller than a
fingernail serves as a radio and a
three-inch silicon wafer can hold
almost the entire electronics of a
computer.
Such complex, yet minuscule
electronic devices suggest
dramatic new possibilities for
medical use, especially if
implanted within the body,
according to Meindl.
Other new developments
involve the use of computers. A

computer has been keeping tabs
on dangerous bacteria and helping
select which antibiotic drugs
should be used to treat infections
for the last 10 months at the
Medical Center.
Knowing which of the
different antibiotics are active or
inactive against various
micro-organisms helps doctors
prescribe the right treatment for
patients, but standard tests are
completely accurate.
Computer Control
"Computer quality control
improves the reliability of such
tests," researchers emphasize,
"and results in improved
diagnosis, timelier treatment, and
far less medical paper work."
In another area, a
computerized blook bank system,
which can give medical personnel
instant access to information
about donors and related clinical
data, has been designed by
University scientists.

A person without computer
programming experience can use
the computer to choose available
donors with just the right blood
type, and print out the names of
people to be contacted in an
emergency or when the blood
bank's inventory is low.
Ten per cent of the blood
supply in the Stanford bank
becomes outdated before it is
used, but the use of the computer
in keeping accurate inventory is
expected to reduce the loss to less
than five per cent. The system will
also be useful in cross-matching
and preparing components of
blood.
Dr. Paul Wolf, associate
professor of pathology and
director of clinical laboratories
and the blood bank at the
University Medical Center, and
Drs. Herbert R. Ludwig and
Jacques Vallee of the
Computation Center, developed
the system.
