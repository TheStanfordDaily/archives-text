Some more information has
been released on those photo
identification cards which will be
put into use beginning winter
quarter.
The plastic card, which will
carry the name, signature, and in
most cases a photograph, will
serve as both a student body
registration/identification
certificate and (for food service
users) a meal ticket.
Although the photograph is an
option left up to the student, it
will be required as identification
by the Food Service and by
campus check cashing agencies. It
may or may not be required by
other University services,
including libraries and physical
education facilities.

Students who already have
Food Service photo cards should
bring them to winter quarter
registration for validation. All
other students should report to
the Photo-Repro Annex on
Panama Street, whether or not
they elect to be photographed, by
Friday, November 13. Cards
processed this quarter will be
included in the winter quarter
registration packets.
