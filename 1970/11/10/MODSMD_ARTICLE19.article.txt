# Poor Communications Behind Bookstore's Economic Woes
## 
### D. CRAIG NORDLUND 
A "change in student buying
habits" and "poor communication
between the bookstore and
professors on textbook needs" are
the primary reasons that the
Stanford Bookstore has been
losing money for the past year,
according to general books
manager Dan Duncan.
"More and more courses have
only 'recommended texts'
Duncan explained, "As a
consequence, one textbook is
returned for every two sold."
With the present high cost of most
texts, "many students are buying
used books or trading with other
students," he added.
The professors are the worst
contributors to what Duncan
refers to as "the economic
pollution" of the bookstore.
According to bookstore manager
Sanderson, "out of every fifty
books placed on the
recommended list, there are
probably only seven that the

professor really deems essential,
yet the professor often insists that
the bookstore carry a full stock of
all titles." Asa result, many books
remain unsold.
Small Book Discount
Because of the small discount,
(20 per cent), given the bookstore
by publishers and the fact that the
bookstore can return only a
percentage of unsold texts,
"textbooks are usually a loss
item," Duncan explained. Last
year the textbook department lost
over $1 00,000. Half of this loss
was due to all the course and text
changes during the strike last
spring.
In an attempt to recoup the
losses on textbooks, the
bookstore has expanded its
stationary and supplies section.
"We make money on pens, but
lose money on books. We cannot
serve the community's needs if we
are losing money. Profits are an
indicator of service."
Sanderson added that the
bookstore tries to maintain
$1 00,000 in working capital to
pay for expansion and
improvements. The rest of the
profits are "returned to the
students in their five per cent
discount. If profits increase," he
added, "the board of directors
will return them to the students
by revising the discount."
Poor communication seems to
be at the root of the bookstore's
economic woes. Duncan cited the
example of a publisher who sold
the bookstore a ten dollar
philosophy text without
explaining that in four weeks the
same book would be available in a
$2.95 paperback. As a result, the
bookstore was stuck with twenty
copied of the hardbound edition
that would not sell.
Reform Needed
Both Duncan and Sanderson
agree that reform is needed.
Sanderson said that he would like
to break textbooks down into
three categories: "required,
recommended, and highly
recommended." "This," he said,
"would give the bookstore a
better indication of the quantities
of texts needed to satisfy the
demand."
Required books would then be
ordered according to class size.
Highly recommended books
would be ordered on a percentage
of class size, while recommended

books would be ordered in lots of
five or six. According to Mr.
Duncan, this more efficient
textbook system would allow the
bookstore to "utilize more time
and money in stocking the general
books section in accordance with
the community's needs." Still it is
up to the professors "to be more
careful in their ordering."
Mr. Duncan said that an
"inventory control system" is
used to keep as many books as
possible in stock. But "if a book
doesn't sell more than three times
a year, we take it off the shelf."
He added that the bookstore will
always special order books, "but
due to the fact that most
publishers have their warehouses
on the East coast, standard
waiting time is about one month."
No-profit Trend
If the no-profit trend
continues, Sanderson expects that
student discounts will have to be
discontinued and a service charge
added to all special orders. "The
Harvard Co-op," he said, "has
already dropped their discount
rate to three per cent and the
University of Oregon Bookstore
no longer gives any discount."
However, he explained, "if
professors will give us more help
on textbook ordering and as long
as gift items compensate for any
remaining losses, the present
discount should continue."
Duncan says that he works
under the philosophy of "as much
power to as many people as
possible." The bookstore is here
to "provide a service to the
community." It is run by a board
of directors comprised of five
faculty members and two
students. "We are not out to make
huge profits at the expense of the
student," he added. "My door is
always open to anyone who has
suggestions on how we can
improve our service."

A FEW FOR A DOLLAR- They're cheap, but not exactly bestsellers. Reduced prices on these books as
well as text books returned or unpurchased during the past year resulted in over $100,000 loss for the
Bookstore.
