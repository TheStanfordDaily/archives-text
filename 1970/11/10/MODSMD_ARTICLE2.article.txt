# Court Refuses To Hear Vietnam War Challenge
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme
Court declined 6 to 3 Monday to be
drawn into a judgment of the Vietnam
war.
Without stating its reasons the court
rejected a suit by the State of
Massachusetts that questioned the
legality of U.S. military action in
Indochina.
The issue now will be fought out in
lower courts while the war goes on.
All the court said in response to the
Massachusetts suit was: "The motion
for leave to file a bill of complaint is
denied."
Justice William O. Douglas, in
dissent, said the court should not have
deferred to the White House and to
Congress but should have carried out its
duty to interpret the Constitution.
"It is far more important to be
respectful to the Constitution than to a
coordinate branch of government," the
72-year-old justice wrote.
The six-man majority consisted of
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and
Associate Justices Hugo L. Black,
William J. Brennan, Jr., Byron R.

White, Thurgood Marshall and Harry A.
Blackmun. Justices Potter Stewart and
John M. Harlan dissented without
subscribing to Douglas's opinion.
The division did not follow
liberal-conservative lines. Harlan and
Stewart generally are cautious jurists
while Brennan and Marshall are usually
numbered in the court's "activist"
wing.
The Nixon administration had
advised the court not to hear
Massachusetts. Justice Department
officials said a judicial inquiry into the
legality of the was would hamstring the
President, insult Congress and
embarrass the nation.
In last Tuesday's election,
Massachusetts voters overwhelmingly
approved an advisory referendum
supporting President Nixon's plan for
phased withdrawal of troops.
The war question is likely to return
to the Supreme Court. In the past few
months several federal judges have
upheld the government in suits brought
by soldiers and civilians, who now will
appeal from the adverse rulings.
