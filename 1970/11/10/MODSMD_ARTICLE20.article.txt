GM Bargaining Intensifies
DETROIT — Under a reported agreement to continue
bargaining through the night, negotiators for the General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers strove
Monday to reach a contract agreement that could end an
eight-week, economy-hobbling strike.
The company said it must have an agreement by today
if it is to get back into production by Dec. 1.
A source close to the bargaining table said the
company had not made a new contract offer and added
that bargaining consisted of "shuffling the pieces back
and forth, trying to fit them together."
Another highly placed source said the chances of
reaching an agreement by Tuesday were "50-50. . .or
60-4 0, if you want to be optimistic."
"There are so many things up in the air," the
informant added, "that they could bog down on any one
of them."
GM reportedly has offered to move towards the
union's demand that an unlimited cost-of-living escalator
be restored to the contract provided the union makes
some concessions in other areas.
The company also has reportedly offered to raise its
first-year wage offer from 38 cents hourly to 48 cents
hourly. The union has been demanding a 61 + cent hourly
increase.
Kent Report Denounced
WASHINGTON - Kent State University's president said
Monday a state grand jury acted blindly in its probe of
the shooting deaths of four students and returned
findings which pose a threat to all major schools.
"In the grand jury's analysis," Robert I. White said, "I
see a prime example of a brewing national disaster.
"The grand jury report was inaccurate, disregarded
clear evidence and, if pursued in all its nuances, would
eventually destroy not only Kent State but all major
universities in America."
Commenting publicily for the first time since the
grand jury returned its indictments last month, White said
in a statement:
"Every one of the charges brought against us by the
local grand jury has been made generally over the nation.
But the direction of the findings transcends the Kent
State administration. The charges are applicable to all
higher education."
Twenty-five persons were indicted in the grand jury
inquiry stemming from the four days of campus disorder
last May that ended wiht the shooting deaths of four
students and wounding of nine during a confrontation
between students and National Guardsmen.
The grand jury exonerated the National Guard.
In a related development, former U.S. Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark said yesterday he will defend Craig

Morgan, Kent State University student body president,
on charges of second-degree riot. Morgan was among the
25 persons indicted by the grand jury investigation.
Cambodians Attack
PHNOM PENH — powerful enemy attacks against three
towns, an airport, and two bridges left the Cambodian
government's northern front in serious disarray and
confusion Tuesday.
The high command rushed several regiments toward
the battle zone along Highway 7 but the relief force was
reported halted well short of the area by the destruction
of a large bridge during the night which isolated the
entire northern front.
Government troops were sent fleeing from one small
town in such apparent confusion that half retreated to
the east and the other half to the west seeking safety.
It was the second day of attacks on the northern
front. The high command said the fighting ended at least
temporarily Monday afternoon in most of the areas.
The attacks destroyed much of the security belt
painstakingly set up by the high command and isolated
Kompong Cham, the nation's third largest city. Kqmpong
Cham is a provincial capital and headquarters of the first
military region.
North Vietnamese troops crashed tlirough Cambodian
defenses and into the vital road junction at Skoun in the
north early Monday but were beaten back only 5 0 yards
short of the government command post.
Russia Frees Generals
MOSCOW — The Soviet government is freeing two U.S.
generals, their U.S. Army pilot and a Turkish colonel held
since their plane crossed the Turkish-Soviet border on
Oct. 21, Tass announced Tuesday.
The report by the official Soviet news agency
indicated that the four officers had left the Soviet Union,
but officials in Ankara would confirm only that the Turk,
Col. Cevat Denli, had been delivered to Turkish officials
at the border.
The Tass announcement said Soviet officials had made
a thorough investigation "into the circumstances of the
violation of the state frontier of the U.S.S.R. and the
degree of guilt of the persons who were on board the
airplane.
"Taking into account the results of the investigation
and the regret expressed by the governments of the
United States and Turkey, and also taking into
consideration appropriate assurances from their side, the
Soviet government deemed it possible not to institute
proceedings against these persons and let them leave the
Soviet Union."
Moscow's decision was announced in Washington
Monday night by the State Department.

Col. Cevat Denli, had been delivered to Turkish officials
at the border.
The Tass announcement said Soviet officials had made
a thorough investigation "into the circumstances of the
violation of the state frontier of the U.S.S.R. and the
degree of guilt of the persons who were on board the
airplane.
"Taking into account the results of the investigation
and the regret expressed by the governments of the
United States and Turkey, and also taking into

Soviet government deemed it possible not to institute
proceedings against these persons and let them leave the
Soviet Union."
Moscow's decision was announced in Washington
Monday night by the State Department.
GM Bargaining Intensifies
DETROIT — Under a reported agreement to continue
bargaining through the night, negotiators for the General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers strove
Monday to reach a contract agreement that could end an
eight-week, economy-hobbling strike.
The company said it must have an agreement by today
if it is to get back into production by Dec. 1.
A source close to the bargaining table said the
company had not made a new contract offer and added
that bargaining consisted of "shuffling the pieces back
and forth, trying to fit them together."
Another highly placed source said the chances of
reaching an agreement by Tuesday were "50-50. . .or
60-4 0, if you want to be optimistic."
"There are so many things up in the air," the
informant added, "that they could bog down on any one
of them."
GM reportedly has offered to move towards the
union's demand that an unlimited cost-of-living escalator
be restored to the contract provided the union makes
some concessions in other areas.
The company also has reportedly offered to raise its
first-year wage offer from 38 cents hourly to 48 cents
hourly. The union has been demanding a 61 + cent hourly
increase.
Kent Report Denounced
WASHINGTON - Kent State University's president said
Monday a state grand jury acted blindly in its probe of
the shooting deaths of four students and returned
findings which pose a threat to all major schools.
"In the grand jury's analysis," Robert I. White said, "I
see a prime example of a brewing national disaster.
"The grand jury report was inaccurate, disregarded
clear evidence and, if pursued in all its nuances, would
eventually destroy not only Kent State but all major
universities in America."
Commenting publicily for the first time since the
grand jury returned its indictments last month, White said
in a statement:
"Every one of the charges brought against us by the
local grand jury has been made generally over the nation.
But the direction of the findings transcends the Kent
State administration. The charges are applicable to all
higher education."
Twenty-five persons were indicted in the grand jury
inquiry stemming from the four days of campus disorder
last May that ended wiht the shooting deaths of four
students and wounding of nine during a confrontation
between students and National Guardsmen.
The grand jury exonerated the National Guard.
In a related development, former U.S. Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark said yesterday he will defend Craig

Morgan, Kent State University student body president,
on charges of second-degree riot. Morgan was among the
25 persons indicted by the grand jury investigation.
Cambodians Attack
PHNOM PENH — powerful enemy attacks against three
towns, an airport, and two bridges left the Cambodian
government's northern front in serious disarray and
confusion Tuesday.
The high command rushed several regiments toward
the battle zone along Highway 7 but the relief force was
reported halted well short of the area by the destruction
of a large bridge during the night which isolated the
entire northern front.
Government troops were sent fleeing from one small
town in such apparent confusion that half retreated to
the east and the other half to the west seeking safety.
It was the second day of attacks on the northern
front. The high command said the fighting ended at least
temporarily Monday afternoon in most of the areas.
The attacks destroyed much of the security belt
painstakingly set up by the high command and isolated
Kompong Cham, the nation's third largest city. Kqmpong
Cham is a provincial capital and headquarters of the first
military region.
North Vietnamese troops crashed tlirough Cambodian
defenses and into the vital road junction at Skoun in the
north early Monday but were beaten back only 5 0 yards
short of the government command post.

Russia Frees Generals
MOSCOW — The Soviet government is freeing two U.S.
generals, their U.S. Army pilot and a Turkish colonel held
since their plane crossed the Turkish-Soviet border on
Oct. 21, Tass announced Tuesday.
The report by the official Soviet news agency
indicated that the four officers had left the Soviet Union,
but officials in Ankara would confirm only that the Turk,
Col. Cevat Denli, had been delivered to Turkish officials
at the border.
The Tass announcement said Soviet officials had made
a thorough investigation "into the circumstances of the
violation of the state frontier of the U.S.S.R. and the
degree of guilt of the persons who were on board the
airplane.
"Taking into account the results of the investigation
and the regret expressed by the governments of the
United States and Turkey, and also taking into
consideration appropriate assurances from their side, the
Soviet government deemed it possible not to institute
proceedings against these persons and let them leave the
Soviet Union."
Moscow's decision was announced in Washington
Monday night by the State Department.
GM Bargaining Intensifies
DETROIT — Under a reported agreement to continue
bargaining through the night, negotiators for the General
Motors Corp. and the United Auto Workers strove
Monday to reach a contract agreement that could end an
eight-week, economy-hobbling strike.
The company said it must have an agreement by today
if it is to get back into production by Dec. 1.
A source close to the bargaining table said the
company had not made a new contract offer and added
that bargaining consisted of "shuffling the pieces back
and forth, trying to fit them together."
Another highly placed source said the chances of
reaching an agreement by Tuesday were "50-50. . .or
60-4 0, if you want to be optimistic."
"There are so many things up in the air," the
informant added, "that they could bog down on any one
of them."
GM reportedly has offered to move towards the
union's demand that an unlimited cost-of-living escalator
be restored to the contract provided the union makes
some concessions in other areas.
The company also has reportedly offered to raise its
first-year wage offer from 38 cents hourly to 48 cents
hourly. The union has been demanding a 61 + cent hourly
increase.
Kent Report Denounced
WASHINGTON - Kent State University's president said
Monday a state grand jury acted blindly in its probe of
the shooting deaths of four students and returned
findings which pose a threat to all major schools.
"In the grand jury's analysis," Robert I. White said, "I
see a prime example of a brewing national disaster.
"The grand jury report was inaccurate, disregarded
clear evidence and, if pursued in all its nuances, would
eventually destroy not only Kent State but all major
universities in America."
Commenting publicily for the first time since the
grand jury returned its indictments last month, White said
in a statement:
"Every one of the charges brought against us by the
local grand jury has been made generally over the nation.
But the direction of the findings transcends the Kent
State administration. The charges are applicable to all
higher education."
Twenty-five persons were indicted in the grand jury
inquiry stemming from the four days of campus disorder
last May that ended wiht the shooting deaths of four
students and wounding of nine during a confrontation
between students and National Guardsmen.
The grand jury exonerated the National Guard.
In a related development, former U.S. Atty. Gen.
Ramsey Clark said yesterday he will defend Craig

Morgan, Kent State University student body president,
on charges of second-degree riot. Morgan was among the
25 persons indicted by the grand jury investigation.
Cambodians Attack
PHNOM PENH — powerful enemy attacks against three
towns, an airport, and two bridges left the Cambodian
government's northern front in serious disarray and
confusion Tuesday.
The high command rushed several regiments toward
the battle zone along Highway 7 but the relief force was
reported halted well short of the area by the destruction
of a large bridge during the night which isolated the
entire northern front.
Government troops were sent fleeing from one small
town in such apparent confusion that half retreated to
the east and the other half to the west seeking safety.
It was the second day of attacks on the northern
front. The high command said the fighting ended at least
temporarily Monday afternoon in most of the areas.
The attacks destroyed much of the security belt
painstakingly set up by the high command and isolated
Kompong Cham, the nation's third largest city. Kqmpong
Cham is a provincial capital and headquarters of the first
military region.
