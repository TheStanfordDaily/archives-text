# Natural Milk Needed
## 
### 
A small but intense drama of
survival is being played in the Stanford
University Hospital. The key to its
successful outcome is needed from the
only people in the world who can
help—nursing mothers.
Two babies are making a major fight
for their lives in the hospital. In spite of
all the excellent care they are getting,
they might not survive if they cannot
receive human milk, doctors say.
The babies cannot tolerate any
formula the hospital can devise, said
Dr. Philip Sunshine, associate professor
pediatrics. The only thing they are
thriving on at all is the familiar,
down-through-the-ages mother's
nourishment and the available supply at
the hospital is rapidly being used up.
One of the babies, Jason, is five
months old. He weighs about nine
pounds, which was his initial birth
weight. He has had a major intestinal
operation, and the blood supply to his
intestines in limited.
Tommy is also five months old, but
except for his eyes, which are bright,
clear and watchful, he looks newborn.
He weighs six and one-half pounds,
although he was a full-term five and
one-half pound baby. He was born with
a major gastrointestinal allergy. He is
currently being fed a glucose-amino
acid solution through a vein in his
neck.
Dr. Sunshine stressed that the milk
donated can be frozen to be used as
needed.

However, the problem of keeping a
supply of milk on hand is a continuing
one, because there aren't ever enough
donations, Sunshine said. "We always
have babies who have to have this kind
of help. Right now it's Tommy and
Jason. But it could be any baby at any
time. Mathers' milk donations are
needed and used constantly."
