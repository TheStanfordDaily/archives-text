# V.P. Of Student Affairs?
## Dean Of Students Role Uncertain 
### CAROL LEWIS 
"Perhaps the very title Dean of
Students is obsolete" noted President
Lyman in a recent memorandum
distributed to key university
administrators. Lyman's comment and
a proposal for a study on the subject
leave the future of Stanford's new
vacant Dean's office most uncertain.
Responsibilities of the Dean's office
have always been nebulous. President
Lyman explained that today "there
appears to be little consensus as to
what the Dean's responsibilities aw."
One inherent problem in defining
the role of the Dean is establishing his
realm of authority. No longer the
disciplinarian, the Dean's aim is to serve
the needs of students. However, at all
times, he must answer to the university
president.
When student concern directly
challenges university governance or
university involvement in American
society, the Dean has a built-in
problem.
What role should the Dean assume?
Should he act as advocate of the
students, communicator between
students and administration, or as a
strict administrator?
This was precisely the dilemma that
Dean Peter Z. Bulkeley faced during
the student demonstrations last spring.
As Assistant Dean Stone remarked,
"Last year wasn't the world's greatest
year. There were a lot of disagreements
in the office."
Personalities Important
Personality is another important
factor in defining the role of Dean. Bob
Grant, member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents believes "structure itself

doesn't create an effective
mechanism ... it is far less important
than the people who work inside it."
Grant feels a Dean who holds the
respect and faith of students and
administrators increases the possibility
for decisive action in the Dean's office.
The flux of student activities and
concerns has always meant an
everchanging job for the Dean. "I spent
my entire time trying to serve the needs
of students as I saw them," explained
H. Donald Winbigler, Dean of Students
for 17 years.
Traditional responsibilities of the
Dean's office do not exist. The onus of
filing charges against students no longer
resides with the Dean, but instead with
the new Special Assistant to the
President for disciplinary affairs.
(This division of labor comes five
years after a Daily article which asked,
"If the Dean was just a counselor
separated from the judicial process,
might he be more effective?")
Stanford was one of the first schools
to abolish blatent parietal authority.
Former Dean Winbigler regards those
regulations which served "in loco
parentis" as responses to the "historical
time in our culture when they
(regulations) were expected."
Without these two traditional
responsibilities the role of Dean
becomes more difficult to define.
"There is a necessary function to
perform in that gray space between
student and administrator" states
Grant.
Opportunity to Investigate
The vacancy created by Dean
Bulkeley's resignation this summer
provides the opportunity for a study

committee to decide precisely what
that function should be.
On a wider scale, this vacancy along
with numerous others throughout the
administration provides an opportunity
for substantial restructuring of
university hierarchy.
The office of Dean of Students may
well disappear. Someone or some office
will however continue to be concerned
with the quality of student life. The
question becomes: will a new title or
structural change influence the
function or authority exercised by the
present Dean of Students?
Director of Student Services is
perhaps a "better description of the
position," according to President
Lyman. In this case a new title would
serve primarily to erase anachronistic
concepts tied to the Dean of Students.
New VP Position?
Another new name might be Vice
President of Student Affairs. With

administrative vacancies including the
Vice President for Business and the
Vice President for Medical Affairs,
almalgamation of duties relating to
students services in a new Vice
President position would involve
definite structural change. In some
minds it would also greatly increase the
authority now held by Dean of
Students.
With the Dean's office presently in
the Old Union, another suggestion is
that a position be created in Building
10 (the President's office) for
"someone close to the top who can
argue the student point of view."
Criticism of this suggestion ranges
from the unnecessary—"the president is
not insular"—to the unfeasible—
"students often cannot articulate what
they want."
With the study committee yet to be
picked and administrators reticent
about volunteering opinions, all future
moves remain an object of speculation.
