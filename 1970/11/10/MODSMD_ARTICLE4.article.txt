# Biz School Takes New Social View
## 
### GREGORY VAIL 
"The Graduate School of Business has rrore
potential for changing society than any other school
or department in the University," said Ron Groden,
news editor of the Graduate School of Business'
(GSB) weekly newspaper, The Stanford Reporter.
Such a sweeping statement certainly contrasts with
the GSB's traditional image of a conservative, socially
unconscious producer of executives interested solely
in corporate profits and avarice at the expense of
society.
But Groden's statement seems to reflect the
general tenor of the GSB 600 MBA and 100 Ph.D.
students. Most of these students pride themselves as
progressive pragmatists, somewhat mellowed by
age—the average being 2 6 and practicalized by
financial independence and military service-over 5 0
percent are veterans.
Although the Business School is still
predominately white, there are 37 minority group
students enrolled in the school, twice as many as
three years ago. Roger Salquist, the GSB Student
Association president says that the relatively small
number of minority students at the GSB does not
reflect any kind of discriminatory admissions policies,
but is rather an indication that blacks and other
minority groups generally do not feel that their going
into corporate business would have any direct benefit
to their communities.
New Placement Policies
While the typical GSB graduate used to enter the
business world with corporate giants such as IBM,
General Motors and Ford, there is presently an
increasing tendency for graduates to join smaller
companies whose fields lie in the public interest.
Partly responfcble for the change is Gerry Peterson,

the GSB's new placement head, who orients his
efforts towards smaller and public corporations rather
than the giants of the business world. According to
one student, his predecessor, who was almost 7 0
years old had "absolutely no comprehension of what
was on business students' minds."
The most popular courses at the GSB are
public-oriented. Tim Wollaeger, an MBA candidate,
says that he never hears a business student saying "I
want to be a stockbroker and make a million dollars."
But whether such aspirations have completely
disappeared or whether they are lurking
unfashionably under a facade of "progressive
pragmatism" remains a point of contention.
Radical Attack
The Business School was the focus of bitter attack
by radicals last Spring. However, Salquist said, "We
do not disagree with the basic viewpoints of many
radicals, but rather, it's a question of tactics."
Tim Wollaeger, who hopes to enter the public
housing field, elaborated, saying that while the
emotionalism of many radicals is understandable, it
has no effect in solving problems.
Larry Evans, another MBA candidate, believes that
the proximity of the Business School to ROTC
headquarters caused many rock throwers to vent their
anger on both buildings. He said that many were
provoked by the fiery rhetoric of radical leaders who
told protesters that ROTC and the GSB "were in
cahoots with the running of the military-industrial
complex."
"Of course," Evans said, "when the radicals began
throwing rocks at us, we were very upset, not so
much because of the damage that they were causing,
but rather that they didn't understand that their goals
are basically the same as ours."

Ron Groden, who participated in the strike at
Columbia in 1 968, offered a slightly different view.
The question that was foremost in his mind was
"Why us? We can't stop the war. We have no more
power at present for change than any other student
group." He explained another possible reason for
radicals' dislike of the Business School: "Many
protesters feel that since the Business School is
training students to enter the Establishment, they will
be some kind of John I). Rockefeller looking for the
next ghetto to exploit."
But the radical feeling against the Business School
seems to go deeper. "The Last Radical Guide to
Stanford" said that the programs of the Graduate
School of Business "all serve to rationalize the
business practices of the 'Free World' empire. These
programs are guided by the needs of multi-national
capitalism. The people usually lose out.
"The so-called progressive programs of the
Business School push social adjustment-no social
change. By this we mean that business urges reform
only within the context of continued corporate
stability and profit. We contend that the profit
system itself is contrary to the interests of the vast
majority of people in the world, and that any
program that makes the profit system more efficient
only perpetuates repression of the people."
Work From Within
Doug Watson, a second year student who received
his bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from
San Jose State, disagrees.
Watson feels that to achieve meaningful social
change, power must be seized from within. He said
that "people like Ralph Nader can only be effective
as long as corporations don't know how to work
