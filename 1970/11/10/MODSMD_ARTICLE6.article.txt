## Libertarian Views Of Freedom 
### 
In his column entitled
"Freedom and Unfreedom" in the
November 5 Daily, Don Ayer of
the Young Republicans correctly
identifies "freedom from"
oppression as a primary goal of
libertarians.
Of course, "freedom from"the
systematic oppression of the
United States government (which
is of the same kind and nature as
the violation of human rights
practiced in all societies with a
power elite, who control the
coercive apparatus of the State)
will not catapult people into a
situation in which there are no
constraints on what people can
do.
1 fully agree with Mr. Ayer that
"sheer physical ability" remains a
constraint. Helvetius made the
necessary distinction quite well:
"The free man is the man who is
not in irons, nor imprisoned in a
jail, nor terrorized like a slave by
the fear of punishment ... it is
not lack of freedom not to fly like
an eagle or swim like a whale."
But in a free society,
man-made oppression will not be
institutionalized by force and
then surrounded with a mystique
of legitimacy, as it is in the
American system.
Mr. Ayer is mistaken in
thinking that a free society is
nothing but an "abstract ideal."
When people have been free from
the control of a state-privileged
ruling class, they have shown
themselves capable of creating a
rich variety of voluntary
associations to provide goods and
services. These organizations have
not been perfect or static. They
are able to innovate or copy new
forms, and people who participate
in them are able to "vote with
their feet" for other alternatives.
This concrete reality of free
organization is what libertarians
support. Libertarians are working
to smash the fetters which confine
the free and voluntary
organization of men.
Participation in an organization
is voluntary when one has the

bill evers

right of secession with resources.
A slave may be resigned to his
fate, and thus in some sense
"spirtually free," but he cannot
change his condition of bondage.
The high costs of secession from
the institutions of American
society (like the draft) stem from
the coercion of the State and the
attendant caste oppression of
women and of racial minorities.
These costs are man-made and
must be abolished.
interpersonal comparisons of
people's preferences, in order to
make decisions on their behalf,
should not be made by Platonic
philosopher-kings (or any other
ruling class). Such social decisions
should be made by people's
choices as revealed in their free
commitments to voluntary
associations.
To say that human freedom is
a primary goal is not to say that
other objectives valued by people
are unimportant. When people are
free, they will not be paralyzed by
what Mr. Ayer calls "overchoice,"
but will freely pursue their
happiness (and other goals).
Mr. Ayer has in his column
emerged as a self-professed
opponent of human liberation.
D.H. Lawrence's concept of
freedom (organic oneness with a
developing fatherland and
obedience to mystical religious
belief), quoted with approval by
Mr. Ayer, is close enough to the
philosophies of the Dark Ages and
of contemporary clerical fascism
to give one pause for thought.
Political authority is
incompatible with moral
autonomy, as Robert Paul Wolff
demonstrates in his recent In
Defense of Anarchism. D. H.
Lawrence's position may in fact
suggest that we would be more
free if we internalized the values
which the coercion wielded by
our oppressors is intended to
enforce. I, for once, agree with
Rousseau: to know one's chains
for what they are is better than to
deck them with flowers.
(Bill Evers is a member of the
New Left Project.)

in his most recent column, "Freedom and
Unfreedom," YR president Don Ayer makes
comments about liberty, freedom, and the
American character that 1 feel must be contested.
He starts by stating that "Americans don't like
being told what to do." This is somewhat like
declaring "Americans don't enjoy being hit by a
truck." Who likes being told what to do? Or, more
accurately, who likes being told what to do as long
as he is deceiving himself that, in fact, no person
or agency outside of himself is calling the shots for
him?
Saying that Americans hold a perpetual distruct
of large, potentially dangerous organizations, or
that the quest for individual freedom has been
"the essence of our national experience"
demonstrates an immense capacity for ignoring the
progress that America has made away from
freedom since its inception in 1789 .
If Americans have been so damn anxious to
preserve their liberties, why have they accepted
and in fact encouraged the expansion of
government from the Alien and Sedition Acts to
the Selective Service Act to Senator Percy's
soon-to-be-proposed bill that would limit income
tax exemptions for children to two, presumably to
punish those who disagree with his arbitrary
concept of the population explosion? The
tendency of Americans has been toward
collectivism, not individual freedom.
Freedom is a relative concept, and Americans
are relatively free. I agree with Mr. Ayer that the
state of perfect liberty is fanciful. But it is also an
ideal toward which all Americans should work,
thus reversing their tendencies of the past two
hundred years. And they should count every step
toward this reversal as a victory, whether it means
repealing an authoritarian law or electing an
official who will work toward this ideal, or, on the
personal level, acting in opposition to all
manifestations of the collectivist mentality.
Toward the end of his article, Mr. Ayer makes
an incredible, rather frightening statement: "To be
truly unfree, (man) must possess the desire to do

Chris hocker

what is denied him. He must be diseontented with
the limitations on his situation." Are we to believe
that, for man to be truly free, he must have no
desire to do what is denied him, and be content
with the limitations imposed on him immorally
from an outside source?
I'd like to be charitable and say that Mr. Ayer
probably didn't really mean that, or that he wrote
it after a hard day with the YR's, or something.
But 1 have this nasty suspicion that he is actually
expounding the classic collectivist (and
present-day liberal) line that, after all, government
really does know what's best for us and who am I
to say that 1 may benefit my society best by acting
in my own rational self-interest.
Even more frightening that this, if possible, are
the ideas put forward by the Radical Left. Their
line, much as they deny it, is basically similar to
that of the liberals. They insist that the individual
must be suppressed for the good of the whole,
while that good is determined only by
self-appointed spokesmen. They claim that they
oppose large governments such as that of the
United States, yet they advocate a system that
could be practically enforced only by a
government many times larger than that under
which they now live relatively freely.
It amazes me that the only choice of systems
apparent in the University is that between Mr.
Ayer's ideas, which accept present restrictions on
freedom and label those restrictions good, and the
ideas of the Radicals which, despite their emphasis
on freedom, could be implemented fully only by
placing a multitude of restrictions on those who
deviate from their arbitrary definition of the
public welfare.
"There must be some kind of way outa here,"
as Bob Dylan says, and there is a way to increase
liberty. Collectivism can only propagate more
collectivism; but reverse this trend, and measures
of true freedom will be gained as each individual
works toward it.

opponent of human liberation.
D.H. Lawrence's concept of
freedom (organic oneness with a
developing fatherland and
obedience to mystical religious

Mr. Ayer, is close enough to the
philosophies of the Dark Ages and
of contemporary clerical fascism
to give one pause for thought.
Political authority is
incompatible with moral
autonomy, as Robert Paul Wolff
demonstrates in his recent In
Defense of Anarchism. D. H.

suggest that we would be more
free if we internalized the values

our oppressors is intended to
enforce. I, for once, agree with
Rousseau: to know one's chains

deck them with flowers.

in his most recent column, "Freedom and
Unfreedom," YR president Don Ayer makes
comments about liberty, freedom, and the
American character that 1 feel must be contested.
He starts by stating that "Americans don't like
being told what to do." This is somewhat like
declaring "Americans don't enjoy being hit by a
truck." Who likes being told what to do? Or, more
accurately, who likes being told what to do as long
as he is deceiving himself that, in fact, no person
or agency outside of himself is calling the shots for
him?
Saying that Americans hold a perpetual distruct
of large, potentially dangerous organizations, or
that the quest for individual freedom has been
"the essence of our national experience"
demonstrates an immense capacity for ignoring the
progress that America has made away from
freedom since its inception in 1789 .
If Americans have been so damn anxious to
preserve their liberties, why have they accepted
and in fact encouraged the expansion of
government from the Alien and Sedition Acts to
the Selective Service Act to Senator Percy's
soon-to-be-proposed bill that would limit income
tax exemptions for children to two, presumably to
punish those who disagree with his arbitrary
concept of the population explosion? The
tendency of Americans has been toward
collectivism, not individual freedom.
Freedom is a relative concept, and Americans
are relatively free. I agree with Mr. Ayer that the
state of perfect liberty is fanciful. But it is also an
ideal toward which all Americans should work,
thus reversing their tendencies of the past two
hundred years. And they should count every step
toward this reversal as a victory, whether it means
repealing an authoritarian law or electing an
official who will work toward this ideal, or, on the
personal level, acting in opposition to all
manifestations of the collectivist mentality.
Toward the end of his article, Mr. Ayer makes
an incredible, rather frightening statement: "To be
truly unfree, (man) must possess the desire to do

Chris hocker

what is denied him. He must be diseontented with
the limitations on his situation." Are we to believe
that, for man to be truly free, he must have no
desire to do what is denied him, and be content
with the limitations imposed on him immorally
from an outside source?
I'd like to be charitable and say that Mr. Ayer
probably didn't really mean that, or that he wrote
it after a hard day with the YR's, or something.
But 1 have this nasty suspicion that he is actually
expounding the classic collectivist (and
present-day liberal) line that, after all, government
really does know what's best for us and who am I
to say that 1 may benefit my society best by acting
in my own rational self-interest.
Even more frightening that this, if possible, are
the ideas put forward by the Radical Left. Their
line, much as they deny it, is basically similar to
that of the liberals. They insist that the individual
must be suppressed for the good of the whole,
while that good is determined only by
self-appointed spokesmen. They claim that they
oppose large governments such as that of the
United States, yet they advocate a system that
could be practically enforced only by a
government many times larger than that under
which they now live relatively freely.
It amazes me that the only choice of systems
apparent in the University is that between Mr.
Ayer's ideas, which accept present restrictions on
freedom and label those restrictions good, and the
ideas of the Radicals which, despite their emphasis
on freedom, could be implemented fully only by
placing a multitude of restrictions on those who
deviate from their arbitrary definition of the
public welfare.
"There must be some kind of way outa here,"
as Bob Dylan says, and there is a way to increase
liberty. Collectivism can only propagate more
collectivism; but reverse this trend, and measures
of true freedom will be gained as each individual
works toward it.

In his column entitled
"Freedom and Unfreedom" in the
November 5 Daily, Don Ayer of
the Young Republicans correctly
identifies "freedom from"
oppression as a primary goal of
libertarians.
Of course, "freedom from"the
systematic oppression of the
United States government (which
is of the same kind and nature as
the violation of human rights
practiced in all societies with a
power elite, who control the
coercive apparatus of the State)
will not catapult people into a
situation in which there are no
constraints on what people can
do.
1 fully agree with Mr. Ayer that
"sheer physical ability" remains a
constraint. Helvetius made the
necessary distinction quite well:
"The free man is the man who is
not in irons, nor imprisoned in a
jail, nor terrorized like a slave by
the fear of punishment ... it is
not lack of freedom not to fly like
an eagle or swim like a whale."
But in a free society,
man-made oppression will not be
institutionalized by force and
then surrounded with a mystique
of legitimacy, as it is in the
American system.
Mr. Ayer is mistaken in
thinking that a free society is
nothing but an "abstract ideal."
When people have been free from
the control of a state-privileged
ruling class, they have shown
themselves capable of creating a
rich variety of voluntary
associations to provide goods and
services. These organizations have
not been perfect or static. They
are able to innovate or copy new

freedom (organic oneness with a
developing fatherland and
obedience to mystical religious
belief), quoted with approval by
Mr. Ayer, is close enough to the
philosophies of the Dark Ages and
of contemporary clerical fascism
to give one pause for thought.
Political authority is
incompatible with moral
autonomy, as Robert Paul Wolff
demonstrates in his recent In
Defense of Anarchism. D. H.
Lawrence's position may in fact
suggest that we would be more
free if we internalized the values
which the coercion wielded by
our oppressors is intended to
enforce. I, for once, agree with
Rousseau: to know one's chains
for what they are is better than to
deck them with flowers.

in his most recent column, "Freedom and
Unfreedom," YR president Don Ayer makes
comments about liberty, freedom, and the
American character that 1 feel must be contested.
He starts by stating that "Americans don't like
being told what to do." This is somewhat like
declaring "Americans don't enjoy being hit by a
truck." Who likes being told what to do? Or, more
accurately, who likes being told what to do as long
as he is deceiving himself that, in fact, no person
or agency outside of himself is calling the shots for
him?
Saying that Americans hold a perpetual distruct
of large, potentially dangerous organizations, or
that the quest for individual freedom has been
"the essence of our national experience"
demonstrates an immense capacity for ignoring the
progress that America has made away from
freedom since its inception in 1789 .
If Americans have been so damn anxious to
preserve their liberties, why have they accepted
and in fact encouraged the expansion of
government from the Alien and Sedition Acts to
the Selective Service Act to Senator Percy's
soon-to-be-proposed bill that would limit income
tax exemptions for children to two, presumably to
punish those who disagree with his arbitrary
concept of the population explosion? The
tendency of Americans has been toward
collectivism, not individual freedom.
Freedom is a relative concept, and Americans
are relatively free. I agree with Mr. Ayer that the
state of perfect liberty is fanciful. But it is also an
ideal toward which all Americans should work,
thus reversing their tendencies of the past two
hundred years. And they should count every step
toward this reversal as a victory, whether it means
repealing an authoritarian law or electing an
official who will work toward this ideal, or, on the
personal level, acting in opposition to all
manifestations of the collectivist mentality.
Toward the end of his article, Mr. Ayer makes
an incredible, rather frightening statement: "To be
truly unfree, (man) must possess the desire to do

Chris hocker

what is denied him. He must be diseontented with
the limitations on his situation." Are we to believe
that, for man to be truly free, he must have no
desire to do what is denied him, and be content
with the limitations imposed on him immorally
from an outside source?
I'd like to be charitable and say that Mr. Ayer
probably didn't really mean that, or that he wrote
it after a hard day with the YR's, or something.
But 1 have this nasty suspicion that he is actually
expounding the classic collectivist (and
present-day liberal) line that, after all, government
really does know what's best for us and who am I
to say that 1 may benefit my society best by acting
in my own rational self-interest.
Even more frightening that this, if possible, are
the ideas put forward by the Radical Left. Their
line, much as they deny it, is basically similar to
that of the liberals. They insist that the individual
must be suppressed for the good of the whole,
while that good is determined only by
self-appointed spokesmen. They claim that they
oppose large governments such as that of the
United States, yet they advocate a system that
could be practically enforced only by a
government many times larger than that under
which they now live relatively freely.
It amazes me that the only choice of systems
apparent in the University is that between Mr.
Ayer's ideas, which accept present restrictions on
freedom and label those restrictions good, and the
ideas of the Radicals which, despite their emphasis
on freedom, could be implemented fully only by
placing a multitude of restrictions on those who
deviate from their arbitrary definition of the
public welfare.
"There must be some kind of way outa here,"
as Bob Dylan says, and there is a way to increase
liberty. Collectivism can only propagate more
collectivism; but reverse this trend, and measures
of true freedom will be gained as each individual
works toward it.

Studies and co-editor of the ARENA.)
In his column entitled
"Freedom and Unfreedom" in the
November 5 Daily, Don Ayer of
the Young Republicans correctly
identifies "freedom from"
oppression as a primary goal of
libertarians.
Of course, "freedom from"the
systematic oppression of the
United States government (which
is of the same kind and nature as
the violation of human rights
practiced in all societies with a
power elite, who control the
coercive apparatus of the State)
will not catapult people into a
situation in which there are no
constraints on what people can
do.
1 fully agree with Mr. Ayer that
"sheer physical ability" remains a
constraint. Helvetius made the
necessary distinction quite well:
"The free man is the man who is
not in irons, nor imprisoned in a
jail, nor terrorized like a slave by
the fear of punishment ... it is
not lack of freedom not to fly like
an eagle or swim like a whale."
But in a free society,
man-made oppression will not be
institutionalized by force and
then surrounded with a mystique
of legitimacy, as it is in the
American system.
Mr. Ayer is mistaken in
thinking that a free society is
nothing but an "abstract ideal."
When people have been free from
the control of a state-privileged
ruling class, they have shown
themselves capable of creating a
rich variety of voluntary
associations to provide goods and
services. These organizations have
not been perfect or static. They
are able to innovate or copy new
forms, and people who participate
in them are able to "vote with
their feet" for other alternatives.
This concrete reality of free
organization is what libertarians
support. Libertarians are working
to smash the fetters which confine
the free and voluntary
organization of men.
Participation in an organization
is voluntary when one has the

bill evers

right of secession with resources.
A slave may be resigned to his
fate, and thus in some sense
"spirtually free," but he cannot
change his condition of bondage.
The high costs of secession from
the institutions of American
society (like the draft) stem from
the coercion of the State and the
attendant caste oppression of
women and of racial minorities.
These costs are man-made and
must be abolished.
interpersonal comparisons of
people's preferences, in order to
make decisions on their behalf,
should not be made by Platonic
philosopher-kings (or any other
ruling class). Such social decisions
should be made by people's
choices as revealed in their free
commitments to voluntary
associations.
To say that human freedom is
a primary goal is not to say that
other objectives valued by people
are unimportant. When people are
free, they will not be paralyzed by
what Mr. Ayer calls "overchoice,"
but will freely pursue their
happiness (and other goals).
Mr. Ayer has in his column

progress that America has made away from
freedom since its inception in 1789 .
If Americans have been so damn anxious to
preserve their liberties, why have they accepted
and in fact encouraged the expansion of
government from the Alien and Sedition Acts to
the Selective Service Act to Senator Percy's
soon-to-be-proposed bill that would limit income
tax exemptions for children to two, presumably to
punish those who disagree with his arbitrary
concept of the population explosion? The
tendency of Americans has been toward
collectivism, not individual freedom.
Freedom is a relative concept, and Americans
are relatively free. I agree with Mr. Ayer that the
state of perfect liberty is fanciful. But it is also an
ideal toward which all Americans should work,
thus reversing their tendencies of the past two
hundred years. And they should count every step
toward this reversal as a victory, whether it means
repealing an authoritarian law or electing an
official who will work toward this ideal, or, on the
personal level, acting in opposition to all
manifestations of the collectivist mentality.
Toward the end of his article, Mr. Ayer makes
an incredible, rather frightening statement: "To be
truly unfree, (man) must possess the desire to do

Chris hocker

what is denied him. He must be diseontented with
the limitations on his situation." Are we to believe
that, for man to be truly free, he must have no
desire to do what is denied him, and be content
with the limitations imposed on him immorally
from an outside source?
I'd like to be charitable and say that Mr. Ayer
probably didn't really mean that, or that he wrote
it after a hard day with the YR's, or something.
But 1 have this nasty suspicion that he is actually
expounding the classic collectivist (and
present-day liberal) line that, after all, government
really does know what's best for us and who am I
to say that 1 may benefit my society best by acting
in my own rational self-interest.
Even more frightening that this, if possible, are
the ideas put forward by the Radical Left. Their
line, much as they deny it, is basically similar to
that of the liberals. They insist that the individual
must be suppressed for the good of the whole,
while that good is determined only by
self-appointed spokesmen. They claim that they
oppose large governments such as that of the
United States, yet they advocate a system that
could be practically enforced only by a
government many times larger than that under
which they now live relatively freely.
It amazes me that the only choice of systems
apparent in the University is that between Mr.
Ayer's ideas, which accept present restrictions on
freedom and label those restrictions good, and the
ideas of the Radicals which, despite their emphasis
on freedom, could be implemented fully only by
placing a multitude of restrictions on those who
deviate from their arbitrary definition of the
public welfare.
"There must be some kind of way outa here,"
as Bob Dylan says, and there is a way to increase
liberty. Collectivism can only propagate more
collectivism; but reverse this trend, and measures
of true freedom will be gained as each individual
works toward it.

In his column entitled
"Freedom and Unfreedom" in the
November 5 Daily, Don Ayer of
the Young Republicans correctly
identifies "freedom from"
oppression as a primary goal of
libertarians.
Of course, "freedom from"the
systematic oppression of the
United States government (which
is of the same kind and nature as
the violation of human rights
practiced in all societies with a
power elite, who control the
coercive apparatus of the State)
will not catapult people into a
situation in which there are no
constraints on what people can
do.
1 fully agree with Mr. Ayer that
"sheer physical ability" remains a
constraint. Helvetius made the
necessary distinction quite well:
"The free man is the man who is
not in irons, nor imprisoned in a
jail, nor terrorized like a slave by
the fear of punishment ... it is
not lack of freedom not to fly like
an eagle or swim like a whale."
But in a free society,
man-made oppression will not be
institutionalized by force and
then surrounded with a mystique
of legitimacy, as it is in the
American system.
Mr. Ayer is mistaken in
thinking that a free society is
nothing but an "abstract ideal."
When people have been free from
the control of a state-privileged
ruling class, they have shown
themselves capable of creating a
rich variety of voluntary
associations to provide goods and
services. These organizations have
not been perfect or static. They
are able to innovate or copy new
forms, and people who participate
in them are able to "vote with
their feet" for other alternatives.
This concrete reality of free
organization is what libertarians
support. Libertarians are working
to smash the fetters which confine
the free and voluntary
organization of men.
Participation in an organization
is voluntary when one has the

bill evers

right of secession with resources.
A slave may be resigned to his
fate, and thus in some sense
"spirtually free," but he cannot
change his condition of bondage.
The high costs of secession from
the institutions of American
society (like the draft) stem from
the coercion of the State and the
attendant caste oppression of
women and of racial minorities.
These costs are man-made and
must be abolished.
interpersonal comparisons of
people's preferences, in order to
make decisions on their behalf,
should not be made by Platonic
philosopher-kings (or any other
ruling class). Such social decisions
should be made by people's
choices as revealed in their free
commitments to voluntary
associations.
To say that human freedom is
a primary goal is not to say that
other objectives valued by people
are unimportant. When people are
free, they will not be paralyzed by
what Mr. Ayer calls "overchoice,"
but will freely pursue their
happiness (and other goals).
Mr. Ayer has in his column
emerged as a self-professed
opponent of human liberation.
D.H. Lawrence's concept of
freedom (organic oneness with a
developing fatherland and
obedience to mystical religious
belief), quoted with approval by
Mr. Ayer, is close enough to the
philosophies of the Dark Ages and
of contemporary clerical fascism
to give one pause for thought.
Political authority is
incompatible with moral
autonomy, as Robert Paul Wolff
demonstrates in his recent In
Defense of Anarchism. D. H.
Lawrence's position may in fact
suggest that we would be more
free if we internalized the values
which the coercion wielded by
our oppressors is intended to
enforce. I, for once, agree with
Rousseau: to know one's chains
for what they are is better than to
deck them with flowers.

New Left Project.)

in his most recent column, "Freedom and
Unfreedom," YR president Don Ayer makes
comments about liberty, freedom, and the
American character that 1 feel must be contested.
He starts by stating that "Americans don't like
being told what to do." This is somewhat like
declaring "Americans don't enjoy being hit by a
truck." Who likes being told what to do? Or, more
accurately, who likes being told what to do as long
as he is deceiving himself that, in fact, no person
or agency outside of himself is calling the shots for
him?
Saying that Americans hold a perpetual distruct
of large, potentially dangerous organizations, or
that the quest for individual freedom has been
"the essence of our national experience"
demonstrates an immense capacity for ignoring the
progress that America has made away from
freedom since its inception in 1789 .
