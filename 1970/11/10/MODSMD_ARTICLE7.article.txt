# An Open Letter To President Nixon
## 
### 
The following is an open letter to President Nixon, who so recently
honored Santa Clara County with his presence:
"Dear Mr. President:
"1 was one of the people who picketed your appearance in San
Jose, California, on October 29. I am writing to say that everyone
who gathers to publicly express his opposition to your policies (or
non-policies) is not a member of (he "vicious, lawless element." 1
consider the stoning of the President of the United States to be
equally criminal with the acts of violence perpetrated by the United
States, under your direction, in Southeast Asia. 1 find them both
morally abhorrent. In your definition, however, 1 represent 'the worst
in America.'
"When those who choose to exercise their rights of assembly and
petition are classed as 'the worst in America,' there are hints of
'crimethink' and 198 4. The few inflammatory leftists cause you to
brand everyone to the left of you on the political spectrum with
vicious epithets; but the few inflammatory rightists win your praise
for demanding 'law and order,' albeit possibly at the expense of civil
liberty.
"You made fine campaign promises in 1968. If the nation begins to
see results an end to war and inflation the hostile crowds will
dwindle. You said you wanted to "bring us together again." Your
statement after the San Jose rally seems to indicate a change in plans.
