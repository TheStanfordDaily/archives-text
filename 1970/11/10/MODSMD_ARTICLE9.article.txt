## Insurgency On The Escalator 
### 
Bangkok, Thailand
(DNSl)...lnsurgency is a nice way
of saying revolution. But no
matter how you say it, here in
Thailand it is on an escalator up.
There are an estimated 5,000
rebels under arms in Thailand and
the number is reported to be
increasing. Hot spots include the
South, Northeast and North,
though cells of revolutionaries are
thought to exist right in Bangkok.
As dramatized by the
ambushes of a province governor,
provincial police chief and
division-level army officer in the
northern Lao-border province of
Chiang Rai on August 20 th,
security is deteriorating most
rapidly in the mountainous
Northern section of the country.
In the North, Meo and Yao hill
tribesmen reportedly allied with
the pro-communist Thai Patriotic
Front now have strongholds
stretching from the Laos border
to the Burma border, into which
the Thai government can move
only with battalion-size force and
at almost guaranteed cost of
casualties.
The shooting in Chiang Rai
only draws attention to an
on-going loss of Border Patrol
Police and Army since
confrontation of between the
hilltribes and the Thai government
broke into the open during the
Summer of 1967.
Troop Withdrawals
The Thai government recently
announced that it is withdrawing
its troops in Viet Nam to meet
more immediate threats to
Thailand's security. It is also
mobilizing the armed forces to
100 per cent strength of about

200,000 men, and is now
registering 17 -year olds for
compulsory military service, and
dispatching Thai forces to sweep
the provinces bordering with
Laos.
This is an indication that the
Thais are falling back on the old
stand-by, the military, to quell
insurgency in the North and
elsewhere. In doing so, some
experts here argue, the Thai
government is falling victim of the
"escalatory spiral," whereby
revolution leads to military
response leads to more revolution.
Lt. General Saiyud Kerdpol,
Director of Operations of the Thai
government's Communist
Suppression Operations
Directorate, has pointed this out.
During the summer of 1967,
according to the General,
"Quarrels over land rights and
taxation erupted throughout
Chiang Rai and Nan Provinces.
The Communists reckoned
correctly that the Government
would seek to solve these
problems quickly through the use
of force.
Villages Destroyed
"The military...responded with
the full weight of their
conventional military strength.
Villages which had harbored
Communist cadre were destroyed.
The villagers were offered the
clear-cut decision of evacuating to
a hill tribe refugee area or joining
the Communists in the jungle.
Many, embittered by the loss of
their homes and unwilling to face
the difficulties of adapting to the
lowland environment, chose the
latter. As the number of tribal
dissidents grew, the military force

expanded proportionally to cope
with the threat."
But General Saiyud does not
command troops, and is
said—rightfully one would
suspect—to be a frustrated man.
There are now an estimated
1600 to 2000 hilltribesmen,
mostly of the Meo (Mung) tribe,
under arms, twice the number in
1968.
Sanctuaries
They have carved out
sanctuaries for themselves in the
mountians along Thailand's
northern border with Laos, in
Phitsanulok Province to the
south-and-center, and to the east
along the Burma border near the
town of Maesot.
American and Thai
counterinsurgency experts feel
they now have the capacity to cut
major highways and rail lines. And
it is common to hear the phrase,
"a Laos-type war" ascribed to the
region's future.
Those who fear the hilltribe
uprising as a step in a strategy to
introduce revolutionary war to
Thailand generally are more
worried about political expansion
of the movement into the valleys,
however, than attempts to cut
arteries of communication. Said
one counterinsurgency expert,
"they are still working with
mountain people 1 if they can
make the transition to ethnic
Thais living in the valleys then
we're really in trouble."
Transition
According to sources close to
the American Embassy, that
transition is beginning to be made
in rural areas near the Laos border
town of Chieng Khong.

Like insurgents elsewhere in
Thailand, the Meo have been
colored Red. Though they appear
to be getting help from the Fathet
Lao and North Vietnamese in the
form of arms, and there are
reports of Meo cadre being trained
in Laos and Viet Nam, as General
Saiyud's statement pointed out,
injustice seems to have more to do
with the Meo uprising than the
ideology of Lenin or Mao
Tse-tung.
Injustice to the Meo means
many things. They are treated as
inferiors (the work Meo is a
derogatory one derived from the
Chinese word for "cat"). Their
silver is sometimes stolen by
undisciplined policemen. They are
not considered citizens and are
thus denied property rights.
Opium Prohibited
They are forced to move
from their beloved five-thousand
feet and higher mountian tops
into the valleys where they often
fall victim to malaria, and where
they are prohibited from growing
their principal cash crop, opium.
They are fined and imprisoned for
making their traditional liquors or
for violating other laws they
didn't even know about until the
Thais began paying attention to
them about ten years ago. They
have been brutally treated by the
military.
What is more important to
remember with regard to
expansion of revolution in
Thailand, moreover, is that the
Meos are not the only ones
suffering injustice.
To the Thai people in the
valleys of the North and in the
Central Plain further south, to the
ethnic Lao in the Northeast, to
the Muslim Thai in the South, the
problems may be somewhat
different, but the results are often
the same: unfair treatment at the
hands of the local
governmental-commercial
establishment.
Corruption
As one American
counterinsurgency expert put it,
"all they (the pro-Communist
Thai Patriotic Front) talk about
on the radio is corruption. They
say if the police won't give you
justice we will. Join us and get rid
of the police."

That expert and others admit
that corruption is rampant and
not getting any better. The
problem starts at the top with
grand-scale graft and finishes at
the bottom with petty extortion.
It is fed by a system of low pay
for civil servants, averaging $4 0
per month.
Beyond the mere fact of
alliance between power and
wealth, moreover, there is almost
no opportunity for the peasant to
attain the privileged status which
permits either.
Wealth is denied him by his
limited resources, high rents,
usurous lending fees (about 10 per
cent per month) and a
government rice tax which takes
half the export value of his crop.
Power, in the words of an
American counterinsurgency
expert, is "for the urban-born and
the urban-educated, or for those
rural-born people who have
abandoned their rural ties and
adopted urban Thai values,
language dialect and career
patterns."
Economic development to date
has done very little to redistribute
opportunities. Tenancy has gone
up in the most developed areas.
Education has gone down in the
most impoverished. As one
economist put it, "Development is
a general increment. It has little
positive effect on distribution of
income, at least in the short run,
and it may even have a negative
effect."
There is growing acceptance
among counterinsurgency experts
here that, as one Thai writer
recently put it, "insurgency...re
sults from the conflicts which
exist over the unfair distribution
of values or privileges whereby
large sections of the rural
community are excluded from a
reasonable distribution of justice,
wealth, political participation and
involvement."
In other words, the Thai
government must not only escape
military escalation but make a
social revolution to quell the
malaise of the country. There are
many here who feel the
government has neither the insight
nor the moral capacity to do
either.
