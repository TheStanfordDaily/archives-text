# The 						Heroin Trip: Living From Hit To Hit To Hit To Hit
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF First in a Series 
Running from drug to drug, Chris' life was a case
study of the steep spiral downward into the dope
world. At 15 he smoked grass and soon became a
dealer in his high school.
Two years later he tried speed (methudrine),
eventually contracted hepatitis from a dirty needle,
but went back to drugs when he recovered. This time
he took "downers," pills called "reds" and
"yellows"—cheap but potent depressants that
produced a fuzzy, floating feeling much like
drunkeness.
From there it was a short step to heroin for him.
"I hated it the first time. I took too much, and it
made me physically sick. But after that 1 started to
dig it. You see, at first you don't care about it, and
when you do it's too late."
At 2 0 he is now free from the crushing heroin
habit. He was doubly fortunate to have family money
to pay for intense medical treatment necessary to
take him off the drug, and he was also strong enough
to pull away from the narrow rutted lifestyle that led
him into addiction.
Running Heavy
"When I was running heavy, I'd wake up around
11 o'clock and shoot up what was left. When I ran
out, I'd go out to some wealthy area around here and
steal.
"I had a pretty good routine. I'd park in the
driveway and knock on the door. If someone was
home, I'd pretend it was the wrong house. If no one
was there, I'd break in and take hi-fi's, TV's, and stuff
like that.
"Occasionally they'd come home while I was in
the house, and I'd have to hit them to split. I did this
for about a year and a half, and I was never caught,"
he said.
The husky six-foot youth comes from a white
working class family in Menlo Park. Chris feels that
there were few family problems to which he could lay

the blame for his smack habit. "I guess it's an escape.
The stuff can really get to you after a while. If you're
ever upset or unhappy, you just go get stoned."
Seven Balloons
He sold what he stole to a fence in San Francisco
and then walked across the street to "shoot some
stuff." He bought seven small balloons of heroin for
$100, keeping three for himself and selling four of
them back to addicts in Palo Alto.
"1 shot up five times a day: in the morning when I
got up to get me going, in the afternoon, in the
evening, before 1 crashed, and then I'd set my alarm
clock to wake up in the middle of the night. I needed
it about every four or five hours."
Though he was never arrested on theft or heroin
charges, he decided to quit. He made the decision
after he ran through $600 worth of morphine in two
weeks. Chris went back to his family who then paid
for a $60 a day tranquilizer treatment in a San Jose
sanitarium.
Cold Turkey
In the hospital he tried on his own to withdraw
the most direct and painful way by shutting himself
up alone in a room for three days. By enduring the
wracking physical demands, he hoped to shake off
the habit forcibly without any medication or outside
help.
"On the first day I was nauseous, sick to my
stomach," he explained. At night it was impossible to
sleep and he shuddered with hot and cold chills. "I
couldn't eat, my eyes watered, my nose was stuffed
up. You can't do a thing except outlast it."
But the effort to "cold turkey" was only part of
the problem. "When you try to withdraw, it's the
psychological letdown that is the worst. Your mind is
just destroyed."'
Single Craving
For eighteen months his whole life was focused on
a single craving. He divided his life into hustling,
scoring, and "nodding" off into a smack stupor. There

was time lor nothing else. He had few friends except
his fellow addicts who only met to buy or sell more
of the drug.
"I couldn't trust a soul, and no one would trust
me," he said. "When you're on it, you'd do anything
for money." He moved around from house to house,
staying with fellow addicts. "It was like living in a
house full of strangers."
Heroin ran his life, and he darted from one
mind-soaring hit to the next. To quit his habit meant
he now had to force himself to leave his life of the
last few years.
Yet quitting also meant that just when he needed
trusted friends to steady him gently and coax him
away trom the needle, he had to find a completely
different group of people. He could not fall back on
his old friends for fear that he might lapse into
addiction again. It is at this level that most heroin
rehabilitation programs fail.
Whole New Set
"When you come out of it, you really need a lot of
help. It's incredibly hard. At a time when you need
your friends most, you've got to find a whole new
set. That phrase 'once a junkie, always a junkie' is
pretty true," he said.
"I had to re-direct my energy entirely. Now I'm
into radical politics, I'm a revolutionary."
His life now is turned around. He actively opposes
heroin dealers "who rip off their brothers and
sisters." He styles himself as a "street organizer," one
who specializes in helping Palo Alto's small
community of bikers, street-people, drifters, and
dropouts.
Chris feels the heroin problem "lies in the streets,
not in the high schools," and so he spends his time
warning his friends against dealers who peddle
Seconal "reds" and Nembutal "yellows"—the same
drugs that led him to smack. The pills cost only 30c
for a good high, yet have the same staggering release
as several dollars worth of beer or liquor.
