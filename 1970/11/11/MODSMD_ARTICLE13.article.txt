# Celluloid Crusade For Christ
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
"For Pete's Sake" admittedly
is a different kind of movie. How
many movies start with Billy
Graham preaching to tens of
thousands in a football stadium
and end with 25 members of the
audience going down to the stage
to "be received by Christ?"
Packed in between these two
occurrences is almost two hours
of the trials and tribulations one
middle American goes through in
trying to understand religion.
Pete Harper is a gas station
attendant who ends up one
Sunday afternoon at a Billy
Graham crusade with his wife and
son.
They then go through a long
period of inability to grasp a
belief in Christ, which they are
hoping to find. Only after his wife
is hospitalized with a ruptured
ulcer do they finally "find Christ"
during her period of convalesence.
After a big Christmas
celebration which his wife calls,
"our first real Christmas, since
we've found Christ," she suddenly
dies from a coronary and
everything changes. Harper ships
his kid off to his mother's house
and sinks into a shell. Included in
his withdrawal are some
not-so-well done scenes in which
Harper rejects religion and tells
off his minister.
But, helped by one of his
fellow workers who is a believer,
Harper finally sees the light. His
son returns home and they end up
living happily together. Harper
becomes the model Christian and
even tears down the barbed wire
fence he had constructed so his
neighbor, the nasty Mr. Cochoran,
wouldn't drive over his rose
bushes.
Becoming more and more
fanatic every day, Harper comes
on with a strong recruiting drive

in the final moments of the action
and ends up converting his only
non-believing fellow worker and
the Yamaha-25 0 driving
motorcycle punks who frequent
his pumps.
The movie ends with the
motorcycle riders heading off
together in their new lives. But
before the lights go on and people
can put on their coats, one of

Graham's crusaders comes on
stage and invites people to come
on down and join the fellowship
of Christ.
No less that 25 of an audience
numbering less than 100 accepted
his invitation. And some of the
remaining paused a moment on
the way out to stop and look at
Billy Graham books and albums

which were on sale 'n the lobby.
Somehow though, considering
who it was directed at, the movie
came off fairly well. The
Middle-Americans who Graham
usually aims at had to be affected
by the simplistic concepts of
religion presented in the movie.
And the sad moments in the
movie really had to affect anyone
who was watching. And while not

driving us to join the movement,
the questions raised by the movie
at least drove some of us cynical
Stanford students into a long
philosophical discussion.
Technically, the movie is easy
to criticize. The acting is often
atrocious and the cliches never
stop coming. Add to this a highly
predictable plot and some

sickening stereotypes, and it's
easy to realize that "For Pete's
Sake" isn't about to receive much
critical acclaim.
But 1 don't think anyone could
feel that the movie was made to
win awards. It's a movie which is
an attempt to stir up support for
Graham's upcoming visit to
Oakland and falling short of this
goal it is at least intended to

provoke some controversial
discussion.
A quarter of the audience was
ready to join up immediately and
a lot more looked as if they'd be
in Oakland when Graham comes.
And at least some of the rest of us
were driven to thinking. "For
Pete's Sake." maybe it does make
some sense.


OH HAPPY DAY—This happy family is enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the Roekies. Notice the peace
reflected in the smiles of Pete, Marge, and Ronnie. Good thing Marge doesn't know she's about to drop
dead of a coronary and her little son is going to be shipped away while his father carouses.

to "be received by Christ?"
Packed in between these two
occurrences is almost two hours
of the trials and tribulations one
middle American goes through in
trying to understand religion.
Pete Harper is a gas station
attendant who ends up one
Sunday afternoon at a Billy
Graham crusade with his wife and
son.
They then go through a long
period of inability to grasp a
belief in Christ, which they are
hoping to find. Only after his wife
is hospitalized with a ruptured
ulcer do they finally "find Christ"
during her period of convalesence.
After a big Christmas
celebration which his wife calls,
"our first real Christmas, since
we've found Christ," she suddenly
dies from a coronary and
everything changes. Harper ships
his kid off to his mother's house
and sinks into a shell. Included in
his withdrawal are some
not-so-well done scenes in which
Harper rejects religion and tells
off his minister.
But, helped by one of his
fellow workers who is a believer,
Harper finally sees the light. His
son returns home and they end up
living happily together. Harper
becomes the model Christian and
even tears down the barbed wire
fence he had constructed so his
neighbor, the nasty Mr. Cochoran,
wouldn't drive over his rose
bushes.
Becoming more and more
fanatic every day, Harper comes
on with a strong recruiting drive

in the final moments of the action
and ends up converting his only
non-believing fellow worker and
the Yamaha-25 0 driving
motorcycle punks who frequent
his pumps.
The movie ends with the
motorcycle riders heading off
together in their new lives. But
before the lights go on and people
can put on their coats, one of

Graham's crusaders comes on
stage and invites people to come
on down and join the fellowship
of Christ.
No less that 25 of an audience
numbering less than 100 accepted
his invitation. And some of the
remaining paused a moment on
the way out to stop and look at
Billy Graham books and albums

which were on sale 'n the lobby.
Somehow though, considering
who it was directed at, the movie
came off fairly well. The
Middle-Americans who Graham
usually aims at had to be affected
by the simplistic concepts of
religion presented in the movie.
And the sad moments in the
movie really had to affect anyone
who was watching. And while not

driving us to join the movement,
the questions raised by the movie
at least drove some of us cynical
Stanford students into a long
philosophical discussion.
Technically, the movie is easy
to criticize. The acting is often
atrocious and the cliches never
stop coming. Add to this a highly
predictable plot and some

sickening stereotypes, and it's
easy to realize that "For Pete's
Sake" isn't about to receive much
critical acclaim.
But 1 don't think anyone could
feel that the movie was made to
win awards. It's a movie which is
an attempt to stir up support for
Graham's upcoming visit to
Oakland and falling short of this
goal it is at least intended to

provoke some controversial
discussion.
A quarter of the audience was
ready to join up immediately and
a lot more looked as if they'd be
in Oakland when Graham comes.
And at least some of the rest of us
were driven to thinking. "For
Pete's Sake." maybe it does make
some sense.


OH HAPPY DAY—This happy family is enjoying a beautiful afternoon in the Roekies. Notice the peace
reflected in the smiles of Pete, Marge, and Ronnie. Good thing Marge doesn't know she's about to drop
dead of a coronary and her little son is going to be shipped away while his father carouses.
"For Pete's Sake" admittedly
is a different kind of movie. How
many movies start with Billy
Graham preaching to tens of
thousands in a football stadium
and end with 25 members of the
audience going down to the stage
to "be received by Christ?"
