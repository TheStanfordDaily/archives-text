# Feminist View Of Mini-Midi
## 
### PENNY GOLD 
The latest fashion dilemma
illustrates many of the attitudes
of both sexes that the women's
movement is trying to fight, and
since many women are still
concerned with what they wear,
the question of dress is a
significant issue.
It is clear to me, from a
number of years experience, that
wearing mini-skirts have helped to
keep women from attaining the
freedom of movement that is
necessary to one's mental
well-being. When wearing a skirt
that is a foot above the knee a
woman cannot help but think
continually of keeping her body
covered. Separate your legs a little
bit and your crotch will be in full
view. Bend over just a bit and
your ass will be hanging out. And
of course, your legs are always in

view to be whistled at, sneered at,
or commented upon.
The mini-skirt is designed to
two purposes: 1) to prevent
women from sitting and moving
comfortably, and 2) to be
provocative for men. The first
adds to the already existing
notion of women's weakness,
inability to do physical tasks,
daintiness, delicateness. The
second plays up the already
prevalent attitude of men to think
of and relate to women as sex
objects.
Wearing a short skirt is only
one of the ways that women try
to look "sexy." But it is a more
dangerous way than, say, wearing
a very low cut tight black sweater,
because that is so blatant that it is
not an acceptable thing to wear
every day. Short skirts are also
provocative, but because they
have been dictated by fashion,
and because women rely on being

physically attractive to men,*
women wear them every day.
Pressure
So the pressure to wear short
skirts comes from two directions:
1) from the often expressed male
preference for short skirts and 2)
from the attitude inculcated from
birth in women that when they
wake up each morning they
should think about what they are
going to wear and should make
themselves as "attractive" as
possible. The first attitude women
cannot fight directly, but the
second is an attitude that every
woman who wants to be free
should make every effort to
destroy in herself.
There is no advantage for
women in wearing short skirts.
(The only one I can think of is
that on very warm days they are
cool, but there aren't many days
in the year warm enough to make
it worth it. And the, if you wear a

short skirt on those days, you
can't sit or lie comfortably on the
grass if there is anyone around to
whom you would rather not show
your body.)
Longer skirts have some
advantage—they do keep your
body covered and you can bend
over or sit with your legs
separated; but they restrict
freedom of movement in other
ways—it is difficult to run when
wearing a skirt below your knees,
and you still wouldn't be able to
do a headstand. The only thing
that should matter about clothing
is its warmth (which short skirts
certainly do not provide) and
comfort.
Rebellion?
It is often taken as a good sign
of women's growing assertiveness
that they are not following the
advice of the fashion designers
and are continuing to wear their
skirts short. But notice the
fashionwhich women have chosen
to rebel against—one which would
give them some small added
measure of comfort and some
added protection from men
ever-ready to look up their skirts!
Instead of being an example of
women's rebelliousness, the fight
to retain the mini-skirt is a sad
example of women adopting the
mentality of their oppressor.
The above should be qualified
somewhat to take into
consideration those women who
are honestly tired of being pushed
around by fashion designers and
pressured into buying a whole
new wardrobe every year. These
women already have; a rack of
minis and don't care to or can't
afford to buy a lot of new longer
skirts.
A practical suggestion: short
dresses look nice worn over pants,
which you probably have a pair of
around. And in general, you
probably need much less clothing
than you thought you did.But I
do not mean to give fashion
advice; what I really mean to say
is "Sisters, think about why you
wear what you wear and if you
wear it to please someone else
when it doesn't particularly please
you, wear something else that
does."
And consider wearing pants.

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS—is this girl wearing a short skirt
and laughing because she is so comfortable in it? Are these boys
gaping at her legs because they look so comfortable? Or might there
be something else involved, as our friend up front seems to suggest?

are honestly tired of being pushed
around by fashion designers and
pressured into buying a whole
new wardrobe every year. These
women already have; a rack of
minis and don't care to or can't
afford to buy a lot of new longer
skirts.
A practical suggestion: short
dresses look nice worn over pants,
which you probably have a pair of
around. And in general, you
probably need much less clothing
than you thought you did.But I
do not mean to give fashion
advice; what I really mean to say
is "Sisters, think about why you
wear what you wear and if you
wear it to please someone else
when it doesn't particularly please
you, wear something else that
does."

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS—is this girl wearing a short skirt
and laughing because she is so comfortable in it? Are these boys
gaping at her legs because they look so comfortable? Or might there
be something else involved, as our friend up front seems to suggest?
The latest fashion dilemma
illustrates many of the attitudes
of both sexes that the women's
movement is trying to fight, and
since many women are still
concerned with what they wear,
the question of dress is a
significant issue.
It is clear to me, from a
number of years experience, that
wearing mini-skirts have helped to
keep women from attaining the
freedom of movement that is
necessary to one's mental
well-being. When wearing a skirt
that is a foot above the knee a
woman cannot help but think
continually of keeping her body
covered. Separate your legs a little
bit and your crotch will be in full
view. Bend over just a bit and
your ass will be hanging out. And
of course, your legs are always in

view to be whistled at, sneered at,
or commented upon.
The mini-skirt is designed to
two purposes: 1) to prevent
women from sitting and moving
comfortably, and 2) to be
provocative for men. The first
adds to the already existing
notion of women's weakness,
inability to do physical tasks,
daintiness, delicateness. The
second plays up the already
prevalent attitude of men to think
of and relate to women as sex
objects.
Wearing a short skirt is only
one of the ways that women try
to look "sexy." But it is a more
dangerous way than, say, wearing
a very low cut tight black sweater,
because that is so blatant that it is
not an acceptable thing to wear
every day. Short skirts are also
provocative, but because they
have been dictated by fashion,
and because women rely on being

physically attractive to men,*
women wear them every day.
Pressure
So the pressure to wear short
skirts comes from two directions:
1) from the often expressed male
preference for short skirts and 2)
from the attitude inculcated from
birth in women that when they
wake up each morning they
should think about what they are
going to wear and should make
themselves as "attractive" as
possible. The first attitude women
cannot fight directly, but the
second is an attitude that every
woman who wants to be free
should make every effort to
destroy in herself.
There is no advantage for
women in wearing short skirts.
(The only one I can think of is
that on very warm days they are
cool, but there aren't many days
in the year warm enough to make
it worth it. And the, if you wear a

short skirt on those days, you
can't sit or lie comfortably on the
grass if there is anyone around to
whom you would rather not show
your body.)
Longer skirts have some
advantage—they do keep your
body covered and you can bend
over or sit with your legs
separated; but they restrict
freedom of movement in other
ways—it is difficult to run when
wearing a skirt below your knees,
and you still wouldn't be able to
do a headstand. The only thing
that should matter about clothing
is its warmth (which short skirts
certainly do not provide) and
comfort.
Rebellion?
It is often taken as a good sign
of women's growing assertiveness
that they are not following the
advice of the fashion designers
and are continuing to wear their
skirts short. But notice the
fashionwhich women have chosen
to rebel against—one which would
give them some small added
measure of comfort and some
added protection from men
ever-ready to look up their skirts!
Instead of being an example of
women's rebelliousness, the fight
to retain the mini-skirt is a sad
example of women adopting the
mentality of their oppressor.
The above should be qualified
somewhat to take into
consideration those women who
are honestly tired of being pushed
around by fashion designers and
pressured into buying a whole
new wardrobe every year. These
women already have; a rack of
minis and don't care to or can't

separated; but they restrict
freedom of movement in other
ways—it is difficult to run when
wearing a skirt below your knees,
and you still wouldn't be able to
do a headstand. The only thing
that should matter about clothing
is its warmth (which short skirts
certainly do not provide) and
comfort.
Rebellion?
It is often taken as a good sign
of women's growing assertiveness
that they are not following the
advice of the fashion designers
and are continuing to wear their
skirts short. But notice the
fashionwhich women have chosen
to rebel against—one which would
give them some small added
measure of comfort and some
added protection from men
ever-ready to look up their skirts!
Instead of being an example of
women's rebelliousness, the fight
to retain the mini-skirt is a sad
example of women adopting the
mentality of their oppressor.
The above should be qualified
somewhat to take into
consideration those women who
are honestly tired of being pushed
around by fashion designers and
pressured into buying a whole
new wardrobe every year. These
women already have; a rack of
minis and don't care to or can't
afford to buy a lot of new longer
skirts.
A practical suggestion: short
dresses look nice worn over pants,
which you probably have a pair of
around. And in general, you
probably need much less clothing
than you thought you did.But I
do not mean to give fashion
advice; what I really mean to say
is "Sisters, think about why you
wear what you wear and if you
wear it to please someone else
when it doesn't particularly please
you, wear something else that
does."
And consider wearing pants.

THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS—is this girl wearing a short skirt
and laughing because she is so comfortable in it? Are these boys
gaping at her legs because they look so comfortable? Or might there
be something else involved, as our friend up front seems to suggest?
The latest fashion dilemma
illustrates many of the attitudes
of both sexes that the women's
movement is trying to fight, and
since many women are still
concerned with what they wear,
the question of dress is a
significant issue.
It is clear to me, from a
number of years experience, that
wearing mini-skirts have helped to
keep women from attaining the
freedom of movement that is
necessary to one's mental
well-being. When wearing a skirt
that is a foot above the knee a
woman cannot help but think
continually of keeping her body
covered. Separate your legs a little
bit and your crotch will be in full
view. Bend over just a bit and
your ass will be hanging out. And
of course, your legs are always in

view to be whistled at, sneered at,
or commented upon.
The mini-skirt is designed to
two purposes: 1) to prevent
women from sitting and moving
comfortably, and 2) to be
provocative for men. The first
adds to the already existing
notion of women's weakness,
inability to do physical tasks,
daintiness, delicateness. The
second plays up the already
prevalent attitude of men to think
of and relate to women as sex
objects.
Wearing a short skirt is only
one of the ways that women try
to look "sexy." But it is a more
dangerous way than, say, wearing
a very low cut tight black sweater,
because that is so blatant that it is
not an acceptable thing to wear
every day. Short skirts are also
provocative, but because they
have been dictated by fashion,
and because women rely on being

physically attractive to men,*
women wear them every day.
Pressure
So the pressure to wear short
skirts comes from two directions:
1) from the often expressed male
preference for short skirts and 2)
from the attitude inculcated from
birth in women that when they
wake up each morning they
should think about what they are
going to wear and should make
themselves as "attractive" as
possible. The first attitude women
cannot fight directly, but the
second is an attitude that every
woman who wants to be free
should make every effort to
destroy in herself.
There is no advantage for
women in wearing short skirts.
(The only one I can think of is
that on very warm days they are
cool, but there aren't many days
in the year warm enough to make
it worth it. And the, if you wear a

short skirt on those days, you
can't sit or lie comfortably on the
grass if there is anyone around to
whom you would rather not show
your body.)
Longer skirts have some
advantage—they do keep your
body covered and you can bend
over or sit with your legs
separated; but they restrict
freedom of movement in other
ways—it is difficult to run when
wearing a skirt below your knees,
and you still wouldn't be able to
do a headstand. The only thing
that should matter about clothing
is its warmth (which short skirts
certainly do not provide) and
comfort.
