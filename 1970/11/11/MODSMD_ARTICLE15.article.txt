# Fall To Fall--Defeat To Victory

### 
THEN AND NOW-Football
coach John Ralston (above) is
seen reacting to the scoreboard
which tells the unbelievable story
of how USC stole the Rose Bowl
last year. A year later in the photo
to the right he is seen reacting to
Stanford s first Rose Bowl trip in
19 years. Surprisingly he doesn't
seem any happier now that he
won. Maybe he's thinking about
all the Christmas parties he'll miss
while he's in Pasadena for two
weeks.
