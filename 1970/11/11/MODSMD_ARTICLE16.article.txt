# Harriers Run Ragged
## 
### 
It wasn't much, but it was still
a win.
Stanford's cross country team
finished out an undefeated
dual-meet season Saturday,
defeating California 24-31 in a
race Coach Marshall Clark called
"ragged."
Highlight for the Tribe was
Don Kardong's 18 :5 0.1 first-place
time over the four-mile course at
Layfayette Reservoir near
Berkeley which was only a tenth
of a second off ex-bear Bob
Waldon's course record.
Cal's top runner, Cliff West,
finished second, 20 seconds
behind Kardong.
Bernie Lahde (19:13) placed
third, Brian Mittelstaedt (19:40)
was fifth, Arvid Kretz (19:44) was
sixth and Duncan McDonald
(20:01) finished ninth to
complete Stanford scoring.
The Indians had figured to win
by a bigger margin. Part of the
problem was that Robert Coe,
who hurt his knee while jogging
Friday, didn't run.
"We don't know exactly what
he did to it," Coach Clark said.
"He's going to miss the workouts
this week and we hope he'll be
back for the league race next
week."
The Bears and Stanford ran on
the Layfayette course because the
week's rains had made Cal's

regular course at Strawberry
Canyon too muddy for safe
footing. The four miles at
Layfayette Reservoir included
rolling hills and pavement.
Peter Fitzmaurice (20:33), Neil
Bernstein (21:02), and Rick
Geisler (24:10) also competed in
the varsity race for Stanford but
did not score.
Though the Cards won, they
were not able to run effectively in
a pack, as they will have to do if
they hope to finish well next
week at the Pac-8 race in Pullman,
Wash.
Saturday, 23 seconds separated
Stanford's first and second men,
27 seconds separated the second

and third runners, only four
seconds separated the third and
fourth men, and 17 seconds were
between the fourth and fifth
runners
Coe willhave to come back to
his normal proficiency for
Stanford to score well at the
league meet. For awhile, anyway,
the Indians had entertained hopes
of upsetting defending champion
Oregon.
In Saturday's junior varsity
race, Stanford's Bob Hay man
(20:29) and Rick Davis (20:50)
finished first and third but Cal
swept fourth through seventh to
win the JV race, 24-31.

behind Kardong.
Bernie Lahde (19:13) placed
third, Brian Mittelstaedt (19:40)
was fifth, Arvid Kretz (19:44) was
sixth and Duncan McDonald
(20:01) finished ninth to
complete Stanford scoring.
The Indians had figured to win
by a bigger margin. Part of the
problem was that Robert Coe,
who hurt his knee while jogging
Friday, didn't run.
"We don't know exactly what
he did to it," Coach Clark said.
"He's going to miss the workouts
this week and we hope he'll be
back for the league race next
week."
The Bears and Stanford ran on
the Layfayette course because the
week's rains had made Cal's

regular course at Strawberry
Canyon too muddy for safe
footing. The four miles at
Layfayette Reservoir included
rolling hills and pavement.
Peter Fitzmaurice (20:33), Neil
Bernstein (21:02), and Rick
Geisler (24:10) also competed in
the varsity race for Stanford but
did not score.
Though the Cards won, they
were not able to run effectively in
a pack, as they will have to do if
they hope to finish well next
week at the Pac-8 race in Pullman,
Wash.
Saturday, 23 seconds separated
Stanford's first and second men,
27 seconds separated the second

and third runners, only four
seconds separated the third and
fourth men, and 17 seconds were
between the fourth and fifth
runners
Coe willhave to come back to
his normal proficiency for
Stanford to score well at the
league meet. For awhile, anyway,
the Indians had entertained hopes
of upsetting defending champion
Oregon.
In Saturday's junior varsity
race, Stanford's Bob Hay man
(20:29) and Rick Davis (20:50)
finished first and third but Cal
swept fourth through seventh to
win the JV race, 24-31.

It wasn't much, but it was still
a win.
Stanford's cross country team
finished out an undefeated
dual-meet season Saturday,
defeating California 24-31 in a
race Coach Marshall Clark called
"ragged."
Highlight for the Tribe was
Don Kardong's 18 :5 0.1 first-place
time over the four-mile course at
Layfayette Reservoir near
Berkeley which was only a tenth
of a second off ex-bear Bob
Waldon's course record.
Cal's top runner, Cliff West,
finished second, 20 seconds
behind Kardong.
