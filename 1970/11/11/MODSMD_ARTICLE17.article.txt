# Wafer Poloists Sunk By SC
## 
### HALL DAILY 
It was sink or swim for
Stanford's poloists at Encina Pool
Saturday morning as they played
USC for a spot in the NCAA
play-offs. The Indians did a lot of
swimming but when the final gun
soundes, SC had eliminated
Stanford 11-8 in a see-saw
struggle.
In the first 2 minutes and 1 5
seconds, five goals had been
scored: Stanford 3, SC 2. Bill
Simpkins opened the Cardinal
assault with a tally on the first
team drive. Five seconds later,
Trojan Mike McFadden tied it up.
Twenty seconds later, Rick

Massimino tossed in a goal on his
first shot. Then nearly a minute
passed without another goal.
Lead Changes Hands
Then with 5:55 left in the first
period, Troy tied the contest
again with a shot by Frank
Heckle. But nine seconds later,
Simpkins shot the Indians back
into the lead with his second goal,
3-2.
SoCal tied it up again with
3:05 to go in the first quarter.
'Hien with 2:10 left, Massimino
put the farm ahead 4-3 with a
well-timed loh shot from the hole.
Massimino scored again with

25 seconds left on a brilliant
backhand shot that brought
applause from Indian and Trojan
fans alike. SC picked up another
goal in the closing moments
narrowing the gap to 5 -4.
Gadd the Goalie
ilie second quarter saw
Stanford's lead increased on
Massimino's successful penalty
shot to 6-4. Although two SC
goals tied the game at halftime,
the period was highlighted by
goalie Peter Gadd's great save on a
USC penalty shot half way
through the quarter.
In the third quarter, Gadd
saveH another USC penalty throw

and Massimino capitalized on his
second penalty toss. Two more
goals pave the Trojans the lead for
the first time 8 -7.
After an early fourth quarter
score had boosted SC's lead to
9-7 , Simpkins scored his third goal
to narrow the lead to 9 -8. An SC
blitz expanded their edge to 11 -8 .
The Indians never recaptured
their lost momentum and dropped
their fourth conference decision.
Cal had beaten the Trojans
10-8 on Friday to tie the Indians
for third place. A Stanford win
would have assured the Indians a
tie for second. Now the Cards will
face Cal to escape the league
cellar.
