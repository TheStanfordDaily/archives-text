## Footballers Sixth 
### 
Stanford's FOOTBALL team is
ranked sixth in the nation in both
the UPI and AP polls this week.
Saturday's opponent, the Air
Force Academy dropped to 12 th
in UPI and 13 th in AP as a result
of their 46-35 loss to Oregon last
weekend.
In a season which has
produced many minor injuries,
two more Indians have been
sidelined. Fullback Hillary
Shockley suffered a sprained left
knee against Washington, while
linebacker Ron Kadziel sprained
his left ankle. Both are doubtful
for the Air Force contest.

Tackles Bill Meyers, Greg
Sampson, Steve Jubb, linebacker
Jeff Siemon and flanker Demea
Wahsington have also been slowed
recently by injuries, but all should
be ready for Saturday's game.
The INTRAMURAL cross
country meet has been scheduled
for 4 p.m. Friday at the second
tee of the Stanford golf course.
Persons interested in running
should call the IM office, ex.
4270, for details.
The intramural boxing
tournament has been cancelled
due to lack of pugilists.
Monday's IM football results:
Alpha Sig 38, DU 34
Dislocations 32 , Biz 116
Beta 33, Phi Sig 0
Zete 33, Theta Chi 0
Cedro 2 5 , Loro 0
It's difficult to imagine I>ake
Lag quietly filling up with water
accompanied by no more
excitement than that generated by
a flock of tired ducks finally
discovering a spot to rest for the
night on their long flight South.
But it looks like that's the way
it's going to be. A dearth of
insurance for such events has
forced cancellation of this year's
LAG SECA Automotive Classic.
Insurance companies aren't
leaping at the chance to cover
student activities following the
events of last Spring, and Lloyd's
of liondon can't get here in time
to inspect the course before
Sunday's scheduled race.
