National Guard Equipped
WASHINGTON - Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird moved Tuesday to provide the National Guard
and Reserves with more riot-control training and
protective equipment such as face masks, flack vests
and wooden batons.
Although the stated purpose is to reduce the risk
of injury to guardsmen in civil disturbances, Pentagon
officials made clear the action aims also at minimizing
the much-criticized use of firearms by guardsmen on
riot-control duty.
"If they (the guardsmen) are trained and
protected, they will be less likely to react in certain
extreme ways out of fears." Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim stated.
Reporters noted that guardsmen and reservists are
now being issued the rapid-firing Ml 6 rifle as their
standard weapon and Friedheim said, "it certainly
would be our desire to see alternatives to that
weapon" in riot-control situations.
He said Laird would ask the Senate next week to
add $20 million to the military appropriations bill
already passed by the House to pay for the extra
training and new equipment.
Folsom Prison Locked-Up
FOLSOM — Warden Walter Craven of Folsom Prison
kept more than 2,000 men locked in their cells
Tuesday, saying "confusion and fear" exist behind
the stone walls that house California's toughest
convicts.
Craven first ordered a general lockup last Thursday
after a "manifesto" began circulating through the
century-old prison demanding an end to alleged racial
discrimination, creation of labor unions for prisoners
and abandonment of California's system of
indeterminate prison sentences with the length of
confinement determined by the State Adult
Authority.
The warden lifted the lockup Monday but restored
it when inmates balked at returning to their jobs at
the prison's tomato processing and license plate
plants. Craven said guards reported hearing threats
that prisoners would be attakced by fellow inmates if
they reported to work area.
Craven said he believes "revolutionary type"
groups outside the prison are responsible for the
attempted strike.
Union Threatens RR Strike
WASHINGTON — A union leader said Tuesday he
will call a nationwide railroad strike Dec. 11 unless

the industry boosts a White House board's proposed
biggest wage increase in rail history.
"This is not enough," President C. L. Dennis of
the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks said of the
board's recommendation for wage hikes of 36 per
cent over three years for 500 ,000 workers now
averaging $3.68 per hour.
Dennis's strike date is one day after delaying
provisions of the Railway Labor Act expire. He said
once on strike, rail workers probably would defy
federal courts and Congress if necessary and remain
off the job until they won their demands for some 45
per cent in wage hikes plus other benefits.
"We have complied with all existing lasw—and if
we go out on Dec. 11, we stay out. It's as simple as
that," he said at a news conference.
Dennis said that if they strike his union members
would offer to continue moving devense shipments,
coal for electric power and all passenger trains.
Mothers Respond
STANFORD — Officials at Stanford University
Hospital say more than 500 women answered their
plea in less than 24 hours after word went out human
milk was needed for two baby boys.
"We were overwhelmed," said a hospital
spokesman.
"There is plenty of milk for the babies."
The public appeal went out Monday when it
became apparent the two babies' mothers did not
have enough milk of their own and the infants
couldn't tolerate any formula.
GM Talks Continue
DETROIT — Bargainers for the United Auto Workers
and General Motors Corp. continued their intensified
efforts to settle an eight-week strike Tuesday. One
highly placed source said the chances of a settlement
were 70-30.
Another source said a 17 -hour negotiating session
which began at 9 a.m. Mlnday had produced
concessions of "major significance" in the talks.
Most reports of concessions made by the company
and the union concern the union's demand for a
return to an unlimited cost-of-living wage escalator
and for a substantial pay increase in the first year of a
three-year contract.

National Guard Equipped
WASHINGTON - Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird moved Tuesday to provide the National Guard
and Reserves with more riot-control training and
protective equipment such as face masks, flack vests
and wooden batons.
Although the stated purpose is to reduce the risk
of injury to guardsmen in civil disturbances, Pentagon
officials made clear the action aims also at minimizing
the much-criticized use of firearms by guardsmen on
riot-control duty.
"If they (the guardsmen) are trained and
protected, they will be less likely to react in certain
extreme ways out of fears." Pentagon spokesman
Jerry W. Friedheim stated.
Reporters noted that guardsmen and reservists are
now being issued the rapid-firing Ml 6 rifle as their
standard weapon and Friedheim said, "it certainly
would be our desire to see alternatives to that
weapon" in riot-control situations.
He said Laird would ask the Senate next week to
add $20 million to the military appropriations bill
already passed by the House to pay for the extra
training and new equipment.
Folsom Prison Locked-Up
FOLSOM — Warden Walter Craven of Folsom Prison
kept more than 2,000 men locked in their cells
Tuesday, saying "confusion and fear" exist behind
the stone walls that house California's toughest
convicts.
Craven first ordered a general lockup last Thursday
after a "manifesto" began circulating through the
century-old prison demanding an end to alleged racial
discrimination, creation of labor unions for prisoners
and abandonment of California's system of
indeterminate prison sentences with the length of
confinement determined by the State Adult
Authority.
The warden lifted the lockup Monday but restored
it when inmates balked at returning to their jobs at
the prison's tomato processing and license plate
plants. Craven said guards reported hearing threats
that prisoners would be attakced by fellow inmates if
they reported to work area.
Craven said he believes "revolutionary type"
groups outside the prison are responsible for the
attempted strike.
Union Threatens RR Strike
WASHINGTON — A union leader said Tuesday he
will call a nationwide railroad strike Dec. 11 unless

the industry boosts a White House board's proposed
biggest wage increase in rail history.
"This is not enough," President C. L. Dennis of
the Brotherhood of Railway Clerks said of the
board's recommendation for wage hikes of 36 per
cent over three years for 500 ,000 workers now
averaging $3.68 per hour.
Dennis's strike date is one day after delaying
provisions of the Railway Labor Act expire. He said
once on strike, rail workers probably would defy
federal courts and Congress if necessary and remain
off the job until they won their demands for some 45
per cent in wage hikes plus other benefits.
"We have complied with all existing lasw—and if
we go out on Dec. 11, we stay out. It's as simple as
that," he said at a news conference.
Dennis said that if they strike his union members
would offer to continue moving devense shipments,
coal for electric power and all passenger trains.
Mothers Respond
STANFORD — Officials at Stanford University
Hospital say more than 500 women answered their
plea in less than 24 hours after word went out human
milk was needed for two baby boys.
"We were overwhelmed," said a hospital
spokesman.
"There is plenty of milk for the babies."
The public appeal went out Monday when it
became apparent the two babies' mothers did not
have enough milk of their own and the infants
couldn't tolerate any formula.
