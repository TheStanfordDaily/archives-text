# MECHA Plan
## Campus To Use Only Union Lettuce 
### 
From now on all lettuce served on
campus will be picked by union
members of Cesar Chavez's United
Farm Workers Organizing Committee.
The announcement that Tresidder
and all dormitories would carry
union-label lettuce came from Jaime
Enrique, who headed MECHA efforts
to ban non-union brands from campus.
Enrique indicated that the decision
to stock the UFWOC produce had been
worked out informally by members of
MECHA, the chicano student union,
and the local distributor.
"This is not an administration
policy. The agreement was worked out
directly with Service Fruit and Produce
of Palo Alto," said Enrique. MECHA
worked out the arrangement with the
permission of Tresidder Union director
Forrest Tregea.

Tregea added that Tresidder would
serve UFWOC lettuce, as long as the
supply held out. He pointed out that
the move was "an informal agreement.
Most of the work was done by Jaime."
The union lettuce represents the
second UFWOC product to gain
acceptance on campus. Non-union
grapes were excluded from< dorms and
Tresidder after a long series of petitions
and meetings during the fall of 1968.
Both union products are packed in
boxes branded with UFWOC's black
eagle ensignia.
In the grape boycott campaign,
UFWOC attempted to halt all sales of
grapes since there were no union
contracts signed. The only way to gain
union recognition, organizers felt, was

to force grape growers to sign or face a
shrinking market due to UFWOC's
boycott efforts.
Thus compared to the grape
boycott, the union lettuce issue
presents less of a problem for the
University since there are already
several grower-UFWOC contracts
signed.
During late summer there were
conflicts between UFWOC and the
Teamster union in the Salinas "salad
bowl" area over the right to organize
fieldhands there. UFWOC leader
Chavez accused Teamster officials of
signing "sweetheart" contracts with
local growers which granted the
Teamsters organizing rights in return
for what Chavez judged were
insignificant reforms and wage
increases.
The Teamsters in response accused
Chavez of heading a "religious
movement." After a bitter strike that
lasted several weeks, UFWOC won the
right to organize the fieldworkers and
the Teamsters settled for running the
trucking and refrigeration operations.
With the major portion of the
on-campus lettuce drive finished,
MECHA is planning to move into a
more active role in community wide
action. Presently UFWOC volunteers
are boycotting grocery stores in the
Palo Alto area. Enrique called for
students to help this effort.
To help organize off-campus action
a series of dormitory meetings are being
held this week. Representatives from
MECHA or the UFWOC of Palo Alto
will present a brief history of the
lettuce situation and answer questions.

SECOND SUCCESSâ€”Last year it was grapes, but today the issue is lettuce and
from now on campus supplies of the pictured produce will be supplied exclusively
by the United Farm Workers Organizing Committee. The arrangement was worked
out between MECHA and the University supplier, and does not represent a policy
decision by the food service.
