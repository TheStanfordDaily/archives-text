# Colleges Consider Insurance Pool
## 
### 
The nation's major universities are
considering a voluntary property
insurance pool because of increasing
difficulties in obtaining coverage from
private companies.
Robert M. Beth, insurance manager
of Stanford and president of the
national University Insurance Managers
Association (UIMA), said he feels the
proposal, presented at the
just-concluded meeting of the
organization, "will receive good
support" from colleges and universities.
If studies now going forward are
completed, the pool could be formed
by next July 1, Beth said.
Alexander & Alexander, consultants
for UIMA, reported that "the current
insurance situation for major
universities is serious enough to warrant
joint action," and added that since the
industry could not be expected to
initiate such a change, the universities
would have to do it as a group.
"In the past two years," the report
said, "universities have found
themselves changed from paragons to
pariahs in the eyes of insurance
underwriters. Some of the causes of
this radical shift are obvious: the
cauldron of student unrest and the

substantial losses to property
connected with the unrest; the
tremendous growth of universities in
physical size, scope and impact on our
national life; an overall inflationary
economy. The result has been an
equally radical increase in both
property and liability insurance costs,
lb some observers insurance companies

have responded with panic. There is
much evidence to support this view."
The study made by UIMA's
consultants covered 41 universities,
representing 3.3 percent of all
institutions of higher education in the
nation, and 1 2 percent of the total U.S.
student population.
