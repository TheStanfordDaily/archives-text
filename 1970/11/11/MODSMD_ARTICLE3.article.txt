# Last Of Generation's Leaders, De Gaulle Stabilized His Nation
## 
### DON LINDEMANN 
The death of Gen. Charles DeGaulle
"marks the end of a generation which
produced some great ones," according
to history professor Gordon Wright.
The former president of France died of
a heart attack Monday night.
"As historians look back over the
past, DeGaulle will stand out from the
second rank of leaders as did Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Eisenhower," said Prof.
Wright, who returned in September
from a two-year assignment as U.S.
cultural attache in Paris.
De Gaulle, who would have
celebrated his 80 th birthday on Nov.
22, will be buried in a small cemetary
near his home alongside his daughter,
Anne, who was mentally retarded and
died in 1948 at the age of 20.
President Nixon was to fly to Paris
today for memorial services in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame.

According to Prof. Wright, De
Gaulle, "as many great men do, carried
off some remarkable achievements and
made some grave mistakes." Wright
believes the general should have
stepped down after two terms of the
presidency, when he would have been
admired and respected. "By hanging on
and insisting there would be chaos after
him, he lost much glamour and
prestige," he said.
Common Market
Wright also believes De Gaulle made
another mistake in refusing to admit
Great Britain to the European Common
Market.
Prof. Peter Paret, a military
historian, added, "More than any other
modern statesman, De Gaulle was
inspired by the history and
achievements of Europe. In his long
career he did many things with which
we can disagree, and not all of his
policies were successful; but even his
failures expressed a firm concept of the
world community and of France's role
in it."
De Gaulle was president of France
for 11 years until he quit in April,
1969, when the voters rejected his plan
for administrative reform.
Heart Attack
He was stricken just after dealing
himself a hand of solitaire while waiting
in front of the television set for the
evening news. Mrs. De Gaulle said her
husband put both hands below his
waist and cried out: "Oh, how it
hurts." Death was ascribed to an
aneurysm, a dilated blood vessel, which
is a form of heart attack.
Tuesday night, in accordance with
the French custom, the body rested in
the living room at his home. Wearing
his general's uniform, he lay on a bier

draped in the tricolor flag. A Cross of
Lorraine, symbol of the Free French he
led during World War 11, was at his feet
and between his hands a rosary given
him by Pope Paul VI. A small candle
burned near the head.
The general himself had said that the
only way to scorn death was by
working until the end. He had
contempt for old age and often
repeated the phrase, "Old age is a
shipwreck." Frequently he told his
associates: "I won't forget to die."
Role In History
Wright knew De Gaulle in 1945
when he served in the American
embassy in Paris and De Gaulle was in
power. He feels that De Gaulle's tragic
flaw was pride.
"He was always concerned about
what history would think of him,"said
Wright. "He once told an aide, 'Every
day I take a few minutes to reflect on
my role in history."
Paret said, "He was both a visionary
and a political realist, equally effective
in opposing the Right and the
Communists. The survival of
democracy in France and in Europe
after the Second World War owes a
great deal to him."
Incarnation of France
De Gaulle, who considered himself
the incarnation of France, rallied the
nation after its defeat in World War 11.
He saved France from civil war in 1 958 ,
emerging from retirement to become
president and restore peace in the
French colony of Algeria. And he saved
it again in 1968 when student-labor
uprisings brought France close to civil
war.
He left a testament calling for a
simple funeral with "no music, no
fanfare, no bell-ringing." The funeral

itself will follow his wishes, but the
government has proclaimed a national
day of mourning as world leaders arrive
in Paris for the memorial service.
De Gaulle was a man who could
have had almost dictatorial power in
France but chose not to do so,
according to Gabriel Almond, professor
of French and European political
history.
Metaphysical Identity
"It is quite clear that in the late
1950's and early 1 960's De
Gaulle . . . could have attained greater
power but did not," said Almond.
He added, "He was a nationalist and
a patriot with an almost metaphysical
identity with France. He intuitively
knew what was right for France."
In the early days of the Fifth
Republic, De Gaulle started out as a
hero, according to Almond. Later,
when his reform plans were turned
down at the polls, he stepped down
because he couldn't get as strong a
presidency as he wanted.
News Delayed
News of De Gaulles' death was
delayed until Tuesday morning when
the word was telephoned to President
Georges Pompidou. He broke the news
to the nation with the words: "General
De Gaulle is dead. France is a widow."
In a lunch time television speech,
Pompidou told the nation:
"In 1940, General De Gaulle saved
our honor. In 194 4 , he led us to the
liberation and to victory. In 1958 he
saved us from civil war. He gave France
her institutions, her place in the world.
"In this hour of mourning for the
country, let us bow to the grief of
Mme. De Gaulle, of her children and
grandchildren.

day I take a few minutes to reflect on

Paret said, "He was both a visionary
and a political realist, equally effective
in opposing the Right and the

democracy in France and in Europe

Incarnation of France
De Gaulle, who considered himself
the incarnation of France, rallied the
nation after its defeat in World War 11.
He saved France from civil war in 1 958 ,
emerging from retirement to become
president and restore peace in the
French colony of Algeria. And he saved
it again in 1968 when student-labor
uprisings brought France close to civil
war.
He left a testament calling for a
simple funeral with "no music, no
fanfare, no bell-ringing." The funeral

itself will follow his wishes, but the
government has proclaimed a national
day of mourning as world leaders arrive
in Paris for the memorial service.
De Gaulle was a man who could
have had almost dictatorial power in
France but chose not to do so,
according to Gabriel Almond, professor
of French and European political
history.
Metaphysical Identity
"It is quite clear that in the late
1950's and early 1 960's De
Gaulle . . . could have attained greater
power but did not," said Almond.
He added, "He was a nationalist and
a patriot with an almost metaphysical
identity with France. He intuitively
knew what was right for France."
In the early days of the Fifth
Republic, De Gaulle started out as a
hero, according to Almond. Later,
when his reform plans were turned
down at the polls, he stepped down
because he couldn't get as strong a
presidency as he wanted.
News Delayed
News of De Gaulles' death was
delayed until Tuesday morning when
the word was telephoned to President
Georges Pompidou. He broke the news
to the nation with the words: "General
De Gaulle is dead. France is a widow."
In a lunch time television speech,
Pompidou told the nation:
"In 1940, General De Gaulle saved
our honor. In 194 4 , he led us to the
liberation and to victory. In 1958 he
saved us from civil war. He gave France
her institutions, her place in the world.
"In this hour of mourning for the
country, let us bow to the grief of
Mme. De Gaulle, of her children and
grandchildren.
The death of Gen. Charles DeGaulle
"marks the end of a generation which
produced some great ones," according
to history professor Gordon Wright.
The former president of France died of
a heart attack Monday night.
"As historians look back over the
past, DeGaulle will stand out from the
second rank of leaders as did Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Eisenhower," said Prof.
Wright, who returned in September
from a two-year assignment as U.S.
cultural attache in Paris.
De Gaulle, who would have
celebrated his 80 th birthday on Nov.
22, will be buried in a small cemetary
near his home alongside his daughter,
Anne, who was mentally retarded and
died in 1948 at the age of 20.
President Nixon was to fly to Paris
today for memorial services in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame.

According to Prof. Wright, De
Gaulle, "as many great men do, carried
off some remarkable achievements and
made some grave mistakes." Wright
believes the general should have
stepped down after two terms of the
presidency, when he would have been
admired and respected. "By hanging on
and insisting there would be chaos after
him, he lost much glamour and
prestige," he said.
Common Market
Wright also believes De Gaulle made
another mistake in refusing to admit
Great Britain to the European Common
Market.
Prof. Peter Paret, a military
historian, added, "More than any other
modern statesman, De Gaulle was
inspired by the history and
achievements of Europe. In his long
career he did many things with which
we can disagree, and not all of his
policies were successful; but even his
failures expressed a firm concept of the
world community and of France's role
in it."
De Gaulle was president of France
for 11 years until he quit in April,
1969, when the voters rejected his plan
for administrative reform.
Heart Attack
He was stricken just after dealing
himself a hand of solitaire while waiting
in front of the television set for the
evening news. Mrs. De Gaulle said her
husband put both hands below his
waist and cried out: "Oh, how it
hurts." Death was ascribed to an
aneurysm, a dilated blood vessel, which
is a form of heart attack.
Tuesday night, in accordance with
the French custom, the body rested in
the living room at his home. Wearing
his general's uniform, he lay on a bier

draped in the tricolor flag. A Cross of
Lorraine, symbol of the Free French he
led during World War 11, was at his feet
and between his hands a rosary given
him by Pope Paul VI. A small candle
burned near the head.
The general himself had said that the
only way to scorn death was by
working until the end. He had
contempt for old age and often
repeated the phrase, "Old age is a
shipwreck." Frequently he told his
associates: "I won't forget to die."
Role In History
Wright knew De Gaulle in 1945
when he served in the American
embassy in Paris and De Gaulle was in
power. He feels that De Gaulle's tragic
flaw was pride.
"He was always concerned about
what history would think of him,"said
Wright. "He once told an aide, 'Every
day I take a few minutes to reflect on
my role in history."

today for memorial services in the
Cathedral of Notre Dame.

According to Prof. Wright, De
Gaulle, "as many great men do, carried
off some remarkable achievements and
made some grave mistakes." Wright
believes the general should have
stepped down after two terms of the
presidency, when he would have been
admired and respected. "By hanging on
and insisting there would be chaos after
him, he lost much glamour and
prestige," he said.
Common Market
Wright also believes De Gaulle made
another mistake in refusing to admit
Great Britain to the European Common
Market.
Prof. Peter Paret, a military
historian, added, "More than any other
modern statesman, De Gaulle was
inspired by the history and
achievements of Europe. In his long
career he did many things with which
we can disagree, and not all of his
policies were successful; but even his
failures expressed a firm concept of the
world community and of France's role
in it."
De Gaulle was president of France
for 11 years until he quit in April,
1969, when the voters rejected his plan
for administrative reform.
Heart Attack
He was stricken just after dealing
himself a hand of solitaire while waiting
in front of the television set for the
evening news. Mrs. De Gaulle said her
husband put both hands below his
waist and cried out: "Oh, how it
hurts." Death was ascribed to an
aneurysm, a dilated blood vessel, which
is a form of heart attack.
Tuesday night, in accordance with
the French custom, the body rested in
the living room at his home. Wearing
his general's uniform, he lay on a bier

draped in the tricolor flag. A Cross of
Lorraine, symbol of the Free French he
led during World War 11, was at his feet
and between his hands a rosary given
him by Pope Paul VI. A small candle
burned near the head.
The general himself had said that the
only way to scorn death was by
working until the end. He had
contempt for old age and often
repeated the phrase, "Old age is a
shipwreck." Frequently he told his
associates: "I won't forget to die."
Role In History
Wright knew De Gaulle in 1945
when he served in the American
embassy in Paris and De Gaulle was in
power. He feels that De Gaulle's tragic
flaw was pride.
"He was always concerned about
what history would think of him,"said
Wright. "He once told an aide, 'Every
day I take a few minutes to reflect on
my role in history."
Paret said, "He was both a visionary
and a political realist, equally effective
in opposing the Right and the
Communists. The survival of
democracy in France and in Europe
after the Second World War owes a
great deal to him."
Incarnation of France
De Gaulle, who considered himself
the incarnation of France, rallied the
nation after its defeat in World War 11.
He saved France from civil war in 1 958 ,
emerging from retirement to become
president and restore peace in the
French colony of Algeria. And he saved
it again in 1968 when student-labor
uprisings brought France close to civil
war.
He left a testament calling for a
simple funeral with "no music, no
fanfare, no bell-ringing." The funeral

itself will follow his wishes, but the
government has proclaimed a national
day of mourning as world leaders arrive
in Paris for the memorial service.
De Gaulle was a man who could
have had almost dictatorial power in
France but chose not to do so,
according to Gabriel Almond, professor
of French and European political
history.
Metaphysical Identity
"It is quite clear that in the late
1950's and early 1 960's De
Gaulle . . . could have attained greater
power but did not," said Almond.
He added, "He was a nationalist and
a patriot with an almost metaphysical
identity with France. He intuitively
knew what was right for France."
In the early days of the Fifth
Republic, De Gaulle started out as a
hero, according to Almond. Later,
when his reform plans were turned
down at the polls, he stepped down
because he couldn't get as strong a
presidency as he wanted.
News Delayed
News of De Gaulles' death was
delayed until Tuesday morning when
the word was telephoned to President
Georges Pompidou. He broke the news
to the nation with the words: "General
De Gaulle is dead. France is a widow."
In a lunch time television speech,
Pompidou told the nation:
"In 1940, General De Gaulle saved
our honor. In 194 4 , he led us to the
liberation and to victory. In 1958 he
saved us from civil war. He gave France
her institutions, her place in the world.
"In this hour of mourning for the
country, let us bow to the grief of
Mme. De Gaulle, of her children and
grandchildren.
The death of Gen. Charles DeGaulle
"marks the end of a generation which
produced some great ones," according
to history professor Gordon Wright.
The former president of France died of
a heart attack Monday night.
"As historians look back over the
past, DeGaulle will stand out from the
second rank of leaders as did Roosevelt,
Churchill, and Eisenhower," said Prof.
Wright, who returned in September
from a two-year assignment as U.S.
cultural attache in Paris.
De Gaulle, who would have
celebrated his 80 th birthday on Nov.
22, will be buried in a small cemetary
near his home alongside his daughter,
Anne, who was mentally retarded and
died in 1948 at the age of 20.
