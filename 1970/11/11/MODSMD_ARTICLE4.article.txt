# FBI Probes Stanford Students Regarding San Jose Disturbance
## 
### 
The Stanford Daily has learned that
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)
agents based in Palo Alto have
contacted at least two University
students to question them about
President Nixon's visit to San Jose two
weeks ago.
FBI spokesmen in San Francisco and
in Palo Alto have refused to discuss the
matter. Apparently, no charges have
been brought against the individuals
sought for questioning.
One student, who asked that his
name not be used, said he was called at
8:15 a.m. Monday and asked to come
to the FBl's Palo Alto offices to
"discuss" the San Jose incident. He
made an appointment for that
afternoon, but after consulting legal
counsel, did not go to the agency's
offices.

Jim Wolpman, the student's
attorney, said he telephoned the FBI
but could not determine what the
agency wa; interested in or how the
student's name was obtained.
"Wolpman told the FBI to 'fuck
off," the student told the Daily.
The student compared the FBl's
investigation to a "fishing expedition"
and charged that the agency is using
"carte blanche" to investigate "every
campus group on the Peninsula" in its
effort to determine if shots were fired
at the President's motorcade when he
left the San Jose Civic Auditorium.
In a related development, the
criminal complaints committee of the
Santa Clara County grand jury will
begin a new round ,of investigations
today into the San Jose incident.

Leonard Winston, chairman of the
committee, would not say exactly what
his committee was investigating. He
indicated that no action would be
taken before his committee reports to
the full grand jury, possibly next week.
"My committee has asked a number
of specific questions of the police, and
those answers, along with some of their
own personal observations on what
they saw and heard should give us the
input we need to make a decision,
Winston said.
The committee has also interviewed
other persons present at the incident,
but Winston would not elaborate. The
committee has asked the San Jose
police for a complete "narrative
summary" of the President's visit for
today's meeting.
