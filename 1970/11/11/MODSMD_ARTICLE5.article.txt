# the 						war brought home

The Wichita State University
football team plummets to the
ground and 29 lay dead. The trees
around the wreck are charred and
shattered and limbs of young
athletes smolder in the debris. A
nation mourns and a Kansas city
and campus are stunned.
H. Ross Perot is a Texas
billionaire who has made his
cleansing of the Augean Stables
the freeing of Americans held
prisoner of war by the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam: Hanoi.
Through Perot's efforts—which, of
course, are commended by Nixon
and Agnew—local and national
organizations of the spouses and
parents and families of POW's
have started.

They claim to be apolitical, in
tact, humanitarian, seeking to
make socialist Vietnam return, in
light of ''public pressure" those
prisoners. And. further, they
claim the DRV has violated the
Geneva Convention statements on
prisoner of war treatment.
First things first: the American
soldiers—around 38 o—are in DRV
prisons because they, for the most
part, were caught and captured in
the attempt to destroy Vietnam.
The systematic mass terror of
total destruction has been waged
on northern — and
southern—Vietnam.
Bombing the North
Every single village in the
north has been destroyed at least
once. Air Force manuals describe
the hospitals and orphanages as
demoralizing targets. The
hundreds of thousands— millions!-
—of dead Vietnamese testify to
the just reasons for imprisonment
of American pilots. Most are
officers, and, by morally agreeing
to commit their bombing raids,
are complicit in the criminality of
American aggression.
Naplam is terror and the DRV
has no air force. And no draft.
The Geneva Convention rules
gambit is specious: they need not
even be called into the argument
since the subsequent violation of
the Geneva Indochina Accords
lead America into seeking the
destruction of the thousand year
old Vietnamese nation. Passed in
1 954 , they called for free and
democratic elections in 1 956.
America, under the wise
leadership of Eisenhower and
Dulles, did not sign the accords,
but, instead, upheld them "in
principle," words rather
meaningless from the mouth of
imperialism.
Ho Chi Minh's Election
Eisenhower stated in his
memoirs the 1 95 6 elections would
have seen Ho Chi Minh swept into
office by an 8 0 per cent landslide.
And, of course, by 1956, billions
of American dollars had already

been spent in defense of France's
racist colonial policy of
exterminating all who wanted
independence in Vietnam.
Of course, the Saigon
dictatorship's tiger cages and
torture cells, the imprisonment of
upwards of 5 0,000 political
prisoners, the censoring of
Nixon's speeches in the Saigon
press are hardly cricket, but.
unreality is just an Agnew away.
The fact that for more than a
year the Black Panther Party has
offered to exchange their political
prisoners for the Americans held
in the DRV's prisons is also
neglected—censored is a better
word—by the American
commercial media is also
interesting. Panthers have access
to Hanoi's representatives on a
much more easy and familiar basis
than America's creep Ambassador
apologists for a genocidal war.
Panthers and POW's
The Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell
regime—tutor of the Thieu-Ky
regime—has, however, instead of
taking up the Panthers on the
offer, sought to exterminate
them. That the Panthers could
have engineered the release of the
POW's is actual and real: the
Nixon administration, however,
content to manipulate and direct
the grief of families and wives,
smashes the Panthers.
And their plan. .
Cynics who might think the
Panthers are as "insidious" as
Nixon, might consider several
things: the Vietnamese war is
against a non-white people, is
genocidal—an open and honest
fear of black and chicano
Americans—and disproportionate
ly drafts non-white males to fight
it. The Panthers stake is as real
and moral as the history of racist
oppression demands. And, rather
obviously, Nixon is the chief
spokesman of the Empire which
has killed blacks and orientals and
Latins and Indians for
centuries—today—for profit.
Hardly the Panther's bag.
China Trip
A couple of days ago, a
contingent of white, black and
brown Americans returned from a
tour of free Southeast Asia and
China with 37 4 letters from DRV
prisoners. Letters to drop into
American mailboxes to spouses
and families. They were met by
armed federal agents who seized
the mail.
Far from "inhuman" the DRV
treatment of POW's makes no
attempt at the barbarism of even

American jails for wayward
soldiers. Far from silent, through
the Panthers, through anti-war
activists and neutral governments,
the DRV has sought to reach
accord on the prisoner situation.
America, however, does not
recognize the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam. It continues
to bomb it and destroy it. It
continues to support a
dictatorship whose parallel of
Agnew cites Adolf Hitler as his
hero. While GI money entices
war-destroyed southern women
into the black market and
prostitution, while U.S. tax
dollars "aid" a fascist
government, in the DRV schools
and hospitals are built
underground. Guns are available
to all the people. Prostitution and
drug sales have been erased.
Vietnamese People
World opinion does work: that
is why, after 20 years of
consistent defense of colonialism
and 10 years of armed aggression
America still cannot topple the
resistance of the Vietnamese
people. A provisional government,
based in rural villages—in Saigon
districts!—leads the south to
reunification with
America-divided Vietnam.
The POW's will be released
when imperialism lets up on its
annihilation of the Vietnamese
people, culture and land. World
opinion, from the streets of
America to Japan to Sweden and

jon hillson

Paris, Tanzania and Mozambique
and Chile is for Vietnam and
against imperialism.. American
"democracy" still seeks to hide
from a much misused and
many-times manipulated
American people that even the
allies of Nixon-Agnew must be
bought.
The POW issue means one rain
drop in an ocean: there is nothing
sacred about American lives as
long as their holiness is used to
mask the reality of a racist,
genocidal war. Nuremburg, and
not Hanoi, indicts the POW's. And
Vietnam's victory—not Texas
billionaires whose interests dictate
foreign and domestic polocy—will
free them.
Plane Crashes
Imagine that Wichita plane
crash, every minute, everywhere
in your country, for 35 years,
nearly without cessation. Imagine
children and families in the
rubble. Imagine the flags first of
France, then Japan, then France,
then America on top of the
debris. And imagine now, imagine
for a moment, the mouth from
behind the latest flag, the latest
gun, the latest leer for profits and
labor asking you for kindness and
freedom for the men who
triggered the explosion.
The enemy wears many masks.
But only one face.

old Vietnamese nation. Passed in
1 954 , they called for free and
democratic elections in 1 956.
America, under the wise
leadership of Eisenhower and
Dulles, did not sign the accords,
but, instead, upheld them "in
principle," words rather
meaningless from the mouth of
imperialism.
Ho Chi Minh's Election
Eisenhower stated in his
memoirs the 1 95 6 elections would
have seen Ho Chi Minh swept into
office by an 8 0 per cent landslide.
And, of course, by 1956, billions
of American dollars had already

been spent in defense of France's
racist colonial policy of
exterminating all who wanted
independence in Vietnam.
Of course, the Saigon
dictatorship's tiger cages and
torture cells, the imprisonment of
upwards of 5 0,000 political
prisoners, the censoring of
Nixon's speeches in the Saigon
press are hardly cricket, but.
unreality is just an Agnew away.
The fact that for more than a
year the Black Panther Party has
offered to exchange their political
prisoners for the Americans held
in the DRV's prisons is also
neglected—censored is a better
word—by the American
commercial media is also
interesting. Panthers have access
to Hanoi's representatives on a
much more easy and familiar basis
than America's creep Ambassador
apologists for a genocidal war.
Panthers and POW's
The Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell
regime—tutor of the Thieu-Ky
regime—has, however, instead of
taking up the Panthers on the
offer, sought to exterminate
them. That the Panthers could
have engineered the release of the
POW's is actual and real: the
Nixon administration, however,
content to manipulate and direct
the grief of families and wives,
smashes the Panthers.
And their plan. .
Cynics who might think the
Panthers are as "insidious" as
Nixon, might consider several
things: the Vietnamese war is
against a non-white people, is
genocidal—an open and honest
fear of black and chicano
Americans—and disproportionate
ly drafts non-white males to fight
it. The Panthers stake is as real
and moral as the history of racist
oppression demands. And, rather
obviously, Nixon is the chief
spokesman of the Empire which
has killed blacks and orientals and
Latins and Indians for
centuries—today—for profit.
Hardly the Panther's bag.
China Trip
A couple of days ago, a
contingent of white, black and
brown Americans returned from a
tour of free Southeast Asia and
China with 37 4 letters from DRV
prisoners. Letters to drop into
American mailboxes to spouses
and families. They were met by
armed federal agents who seized
the mail.
Far from "inhuman" the DRV
treatment of POW's makes no
attempt at the barbarism of even

American jails for wayward
soldiers. Far from silent, through
the Panthers, through anti-war
activists and neutral governments,
the DRV has sought to reach
accord on the prisoner situation.
America, however, does not
recognize the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam. It continues
to bomb it and destroy it. It
continues to support a
dictatorship whose parallel of
Agnew cites Adolf Hitler as his
hero. While GI money entices
war-destroyed southern women
into the black market and
prostitution, while U.S. tax
dollars "aid" a fascist
government, in the DRV schools
and hospitals are built
underground. Guns are available
to all the people. Prostitution and
drug sales have been erased.
Vietnamese People
World opinion does work: that
is why, after 20 years of
consistent defense of colonialism
and 10 years of armed aggression
America still cannot topple the
resistance of the Vietnamese
people. A provisional government,
based in rural villages—in Saigon
districts!—leads the south to
reunification with
America-divided Vietnam.
The POW's will be released
when imperialism lets up on its
annihilation of the Vietnamese
people, culture and land. World
opinion, from the streets of
America to Japan to Sweden and

jon hillson

Paris, Tanzania and Mozambique
and Chile is for Vietnam and
against imperialism.. American
"democracy" still seeks to hide
from a much misused and
many-times manipulated
American people that even the
allies of Nixon-Agnew must be
bought.
The POW issue means one rain
drop in an ocean: there is nothing
sacred about American lives as
long as their holiness is used to
mask the reality of a racist,
genocidal war. Nuremburg, and
not Hanoi, indicts the POW's. And
Vietnam's victory—not Texas
billionaires whose interests dictate
foreign and domestic polocy—will
free them.
Plane Crashes
Imagine that Wichita plane
crash, every minute, everywhere
in your country, for 35 years,
nearly without cessation. Imagine
children and families in the
rubble. Imagine the flags first of
France, then Japan, then France,
then America on top of the
debris. And imagine now, imagine
for a moment, the mouth from
behind the latest flag, the latest
gun, the latest leer for profits and
labor asking you for kindness and
freedom for the men who
triggered the explosion.
The enemy wears many masks.
But only one face.

genocidal—an open and honest
fear of black and chicano
Americans—and disproportionate
ly drafts non-white males to fight
it. The Panthers stake is as real
and moral as the history of racist
oppression demands. And, rather
obviously, Nixon is the chief
spokesman of the Empire which
has killed blacks and orientals and
Latins and Indians for
centuries—today—for profit.
Hardly the Panther's bag.
China Trip
A couple of days ago, a
contingent of white, black and
brown Americans returned from a
tour of free Southeast Asia and
China with 37 4 letters from DRV
prisoners. Letters to drop into
American mailboxes to spouses
and families. They were met by
armed federal agents who seized
the mail.
Far from "inhuman" the DRV
treatment of POW's makes no
attempt at the barbarism of even

American jails for wayward
soldiers. Far from silent, through
the Panthers, through anti-war
activists and neutral governments,
the DRV has sought to reach
accord on the prisoner situation.
America, however, does not
recognize the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam. It continues
to bomb it and destroy it. It
continues to support a
dictatorship whose parallel of
Agnew cites Adolf Hitler as his
hero. While GI money entices
war-destroyed southern women
into the black market and
prostitution, while U.S. tax
dollars "aid" a fascist
government, in the DRV schools
and hospitals are built
underground. Guns are available
to all the people. Prostitution and
drug sales have been erased.
Vietnamese People
World opinion does work: that
is why, after 20 years of
consistent defense of colonialism
and 10 years of armed aggression
America still cannot topple the
resistance of the Vietnamese
people. A provisional government,
based in rural villages—in Saigon
districts!—leads the south to
reunification with
America-divided Vietnam.
The POW's will be released
when imperialism lets up on its
annihilation of the Vietnamese
people, culture and land. World
opinion, from the streets of
America to Japan to Sweden and

jon hillson

Paris, Tanzania and Mozambique
and Chile is for Vietnam and
against imperialism.. American
"democracy" still seeks to hide
from a much misused and
many-times manipulated
American people that even the
allies of Nixon-Agnew must be
bought.
The POW issue means one rain
drop in an ocean: there is nothing
sacred about American lives as
long as their holiness is used to
mask the reality of a racist,
genocidal war. Nuremburg, and
not Hanoi, indicts the POW's. And
Vietnam's victory—not Texas
billionaires whose interests dictate
foreign and domestic polocy—will
free them.
Plane Crashes
Imagine that Wichita plane
crash, every minute, everywhere
in your country, for 35 years,
nearly without cessation. Imagine
children and families in the
rubble. Imagine the flags first of
France, then Japan, then France,
then America on top of the
debris. And imagine now, imagine
for a moment, the mouth from
behind the latest flag, the latest
gun, the latest leer for profits and
labor asking you for kindness and
freedom for the men who
triggered the explosion.
The enemy wears many masks.
But only one face.

The Wichita State University

around the wreck are charred and
shattered and limbs of young

H. Ross Perot is a Texas
billionaire who has made his
cleansing of the Augean Stables
the freeing of Americans held
prisoner of war by the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam: Hanoi.
Through Perot's efforts—which, of
course, are commended by Nixon
and Agnew—local and national
organizations of the spouses and
parents and families of POW's
have started.

They claim to be apolitical, in
tact, humanitarian, seeking to
make socialist Vietnam return, in
light of ''public pressure" those
prisoners. And. further, they
claim the DRV has violated the
Geneva Convention statements on
prisoner of war treatment.
First things first: the American
soldiers—around 38 o—are in DRV
prisons because they, for the most
part, were caught and captured in
the attempt to destroy Vietnam.
The systematic mass terror of
total destruction has been waged
on northern — and
southern—Vietnam.
Bombing the North
Every single village in the
north has been destroyed at least
once. Air Force manuals describe
the hospitals and orphanages as
demoralizing targets. The
hundreds of thousands— millions!-
—of dead Vietnamese testify to
the just reasons for imprisonment
of American pilots. Most are
officers, and, by morally agreeing
to commit their bombing raids,
are complicit in the criminality of
American aggression.
Naplam is terror and the DRV
has no air force. And no draft.
The Geneva Convention rules
gambit is specious: they need not
even be called into the argument
since the subsequent violation of
the Geneva Indochina Accords
lead America into seeking the
destruction of the thousand year
old Vietnamese nation. Passed in
1 954 , they called for free and
democratic elections in 1 956.
America, under the wise
leadership of Eisenhower and
Dulles, did not sign the accords,
but, instead, upheld them "in
principle," words rather
meaningless from the mouth of
imperialism.
Ho Chi Minh's Election
Eisenhower stated in his
memoirs the 1 95 6 elections would
have seen Ho Chi Minh swept into
office by an 8 0 per cent landslide.
And, of course, by 1956, billions
of American dollars had already

been spent in defense of France's
racist colonial policy of
exterminating all who wanted
independence in Vietnam.
Of course, the Saigon
dictatorship's tiger cages and
torture cells, the imprisonment of
upwards of 5 0,000 political
prisoners, the censoring of
Nixon's speeches in the Saigon
press are hardly cricket, but.
unreality is just an Agnew away.
The fact that for more than a
year the Black Panther Party has
offered to exchange their political
prisoners for the Americans held
in the DRV's prisons is also
neglected—censored is a better
word—by the American
commercial media is also
interesting. Panthers have access
to Hanoi's representatives on a
much more easy and familiar basis
than America's creep Ambassador
apologists for a genocidal war.
Panthers and POW's
The Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell
regime—tutor of the Thieu-Ky
regime—has, however, instead of
taking up the Panthers on the
offer, sought to exterminate
them. That the Panthers could
have engineered the release of the
POW's is actual and real: the
Nixon administration, however,
content to manipulate and direct
the grief of families and wives,
smashes the Panthers.
And their plan. .
Cynics who might think the
Panthers are as "insidious" as
Nixon, might consider several
things: the Vietnamese war is
against a non-white people, is
genocidal—an open and honest
fear of black and chicano
Americans—and disproportionate
ly drafts non-white males to fight
it. The Panthers stake is as real

people, culture and land. World
opinion, from the streets of
America to Japan to Sweden and

Paris, Tanzania and Mozambique
and Chile is for Vietnam and
against imperialism.. American
"democracy" still seeks to hide
from a much misused and
many-times manipulated
American people that even the
allies of Nixon-Agnew must be
bought.
The POW issue means one rain
drop in an ocean: there is nothing
sacred about American lives as
long as their holiness is used to
mask the reality of a racist,
genocidal war. Nuremburg, and
not Hanoi, indicts the POW's. And
Vietnam's victory—not Texas
billionaires whose interests dictate
foreign and domestic polocy—will
free them.
Plane Crashes
Imagine that Wichita plane
crash, every minute, everywhere
in your country, for 35 years,
nearly without cessation. Imagine
children and families in the
rubble. Imagine the flags first of
France, then Japan, then France,
then America on top of the
debris. And imagine now, imagine
for a moment, the mouth from
behind the latest flag, the latest
gun, the latest leer for profits and
labor asking you for kindness and
freedom for the men who
triggered the explosion.
The enemy wears many masks.
But only one face.

The Wichita State University
football team plummets to the
ground and 29 lay dead. The trees
around the wreck are charred and
shattered and limbs of young
athletes smolder in the debris. A
nation mourns and a Kansas city
and campus are stunned.
H. Ross Perot is a Texas
billionaire who has made his
cleansing of the Augean Stables
the freeing of Americans held
prisoner of war by the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam: Hanoi.
Through Perot's efforts—which, of
course, are commended by Nixon
and Agnew—local and national
organizations of the spouses and
parents and families of POW's
have started.

They claim to be apolitical, in
tact, humanitarian, seeking to
make socialist Vietnam return, in
light of ''public pressure" those
prisoners. And. further, they
claim the DRV has violated the
Geneva Convention statements on
prisoner of war treatment.
First things first: the American
soldiers—around 38 o—are in DRV
prisons because they, for the most
part, were caught and captured in
the attempt to destroy Vietnam.
The systematic mass terror of
total destruction has been waged
on northern — and
southern—Vietnam.
Bombing the North
Every single village in the
north has been destroyed at least
once. Air Force manuals describe
the hospitals and orphanages as
demoralizing targets. The
hundreds of thousands— millions!-
—of dead Vietnamese testify to
the just reasons for imprisonment
of American pilots. Most are
officers, and, by morally agreeing
to commit their bombing raids,
are complicit in the criminality of
American aggression.
Naplam is terror and the DRV
has no air force. And no draft.
The Geneva Convention rules
gambit is specious: they need not
even be called into the argument
since the subsequent violation of
the Geneva Indochina Accords
lead America into seeking the
destruction of the thousand year
old Vietnamese nation. Passed in
1 954 , they called for free and
democratic elections in 1 956.
America, under the wise
leadership of Eisenhower and
Dulles, did not sign the accords,
but, instead, upheld them "in
principle," words rather
meaningless from the mouth of
imperialism.
Ho Chi Minh's Election
Eisenhower stated in his
memoirs the 1 95 6 elections would
have seen Ho Chi Minh swept into
office by an 8 0 per cent landslide.
And, of course, by 1956, billions
of American dollars had already

been spent in defense of France's
racist colonial policy of
exterminating all who wanted
independence in Vietnam.
Of course, the Saigon
dictatorship's tiger cages and
torture cells, the imprisonment of
upwards of 5 0,000 political
prisoners, the censoring of
Nixon's speeches in the Saigon
press are hardly cricket, but.
unreality is just an Agnew away.
The fact that for more than a
year the Black Panther Party has
offered to exchange their political
prisoners for the Americans held
in the DRV's prisons is also
neglected—censored is a better
word—by the American
commercial media is also
interesting. Panthers have access
to Hanoi's representatives on a
much more easy and familiar basis
than America's creep Ambassador
apologists for a genocidal war.
Panthers and POW's
The Nixon-Agnew-Mitchell
regime—tutor of the Thieu-Ky
regime—has, however, instead of
taking up the Panthers on the
offer, sought to exterminate
them. That the Panthers could
have engineered the release of the
POW's is actual and real: the
Nixon administration, however,
content to manipulate and direct
the grief of families and wives,
smashes the Panthers.
And their plan. .
Cynics who might think the
Panthers are as "insidious" as
Nixon, might consider several
things: the Vietnamese war is
against a non-white people, is
genocidal—an open and honest
fear of black and chicano
Americans—and disproportionate
ly drafts non-white males to fight
it. The Panthers stake is as real
and moral as the history of racist
oppression demands. And, rather
obviously, Nixon is the chief
spokesman of the Empire which
has killed blacks and orientals and
Latins and Indians for
centuries—today—for profit.
Hardly the Panther's bag.
China Trip
A couple of days ago, a
contingent of white, black and
brown Americans returned from a
tour of free Southeast Asia and
China with 37 4 letters from DRV
prisoners. Letters to drop into
American mailboxes to spouses
and families. They were met by
armed federal agents who seized
the mail.
Far from "inhuman" the DRV
treatment of POW's makes no
attempt at the barbarism of even

American jails for wayward
soldiers. Far from silent, through
the Panthers, through anti-war
activists and neutral governments,
the DRV has sought to reach
accord on the prisoner situation.
America, however, does not
recognize the Democratic
Republic of Vietnam. It continues
to bomb it and destroy it. It
continues to support a
dictatorship whose parallel of
Agnew cites Adolf Hitler as his
hero. While GI money entices
war-destroyed southern women
into the black market and
prostitution, while U.S. tax
dollars "aid" a fascist
government, in the DRV schools
and hospitals are built
underground. Guns are available
to all the people. Prostitution and
drug sales have been erased.
Vietnamese People
World opinion does work: that
is why, after 20 years of
consistent defense of colonialism
and 10 years of armed aggression
America still cannot topple the
resistance of the Vietnamese
people. A provisional government,
based in rural villages—in Saigon
districts!—leads the south to
reunification with
America-divided Vietnam.
The POW's will be released
when imperialism lets up on its
annihilation of the Vietnamese
people, culture and land. World
opinion, from the streets of
America to Japan to Sweden and
