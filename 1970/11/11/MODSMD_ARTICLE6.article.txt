## Liberate The 'Daily' 
### 
wily liberator

To the People:
Have you ever really considered what is behind the brouhaha over
demands that the Daily go independent? Just think for a moment
whose interests are served by the Daily and how you would go about
protecting those interests.
There is a curious entanglement between our so called radical
newspaper and a university deeply involved with the imperialist
Defense Department and the Fascist police repression.
If the university really did not like the paily, why would it give the
paper a large, tax free, rent free building to operate out of? Have you
ever visited the Storke building? Ask who built it for the Daily. You
might be surprised at the names of the alumni contributors.
If the university really did not like the Daily, why would it allow
the paper to accumulate $20,000 in debts? What better way to
control a group than to have them in your debt.
If the Daily is in such financial distress that it must ask for $1 per
quarter from every student, why does it print university
announcements for free 1 Remember the adage about you scratch my
back. . . ?7?

But if these cntaglements really represent anything more than mere
coincidence, why was such a fuss made about making the Daily
independent? That same proposal has been made every year for the
last five years and nothing has ever been done about it. And nothing
ever will. The administration won't release its house organ. Instead, a
false sense of conflict is created, a straw man argument is set up and
broken down. The Daily and the administration are publicly displayed
as at odds, while behind the scenes they work together. Have you
heard anything more about plans for making the Daily independent?
Don't hold your breath.
But what else does the university get out of this deal, what makes
the Daily so valuable to them?
The Daily is the most important socializing influence on this
campus. The material in the paper each day floods every person on
this campus with propaganda that supports this capitalist state of
Amerika that we live in.
Advertisements
Count the number of column inches each day devoted to capitalist
enterprise. Every day advertisements fill column after column. Could
anything be more effective at submerging the revolutionary sense than
to publicize the propaganda of the capitalist elite in such a subtle and
indirect manner. Count the square inches devoted to this. It's
astonishing.
Now count the number of editorial columns by fascists like Sidney
Hook and J. Edgar Hoover. Remember the Hoover article 1 Check
back issues of the Daily, he's there. This propaganda is doubly
effective, because it not only confuses potential revolutionaries with
irrational arguments, but it creates the impression that in fact there
are two sides to the argument. The Daily is trying to foist on the
uneducated masses the idea that someone could honestly hold such
fascist opinions.
Few Left Writers
Finally, count the number of writers for the revolutionary left.
Have you noticed the clever technique they use to make you think
there are only a small group of revolutionaries on campus? And to
make you think they are afraid of the fascist pigs? The first technique
is simply to allow only the same person to write for the Daily. Ever
heard people ask why the Daily prints so many articles by Lenny
Siegel? The second technique is to make the articles anonymous. Ever
heard people ask why the revolutionaries are afraid to identify
themselves? A subtle but effective way to undermine the credibility of
our revolutionary brothers!
Does it all seem a little clearer to you now? Do you 9ee the
interlocking interests, the subtle socializing techniques that make the
Daily so valuable to the administration.
One cause of action will free the people from this tool of
oppression. This time we really must liberate the Daily. We have to
free it from the control of the administration and allow it to become a
true voice of the people and the revolution and not the lackeyorgan of
the administration it is today. Fight for an independent Daily!
Up the Revolution.
People Power.

Now count the number of editorial columns by fascists like Sidney
Hook and J. Edgar Hoover. Remember the Hoover article 1 Check
back issues of the Daily, he's there. This propaganda is doubly
effective, because it not only confuses potential revolutionaries with
irrational arguments, but it creates the impression that in fact there
are two sides to the argument. The Daily is trying to foist on the
uneducated masses the idea that someone could honestly hold such
fascist opinions.
Few Left Writers
Finally, count the number of writers for the revolutionary left.
Have you noticed the clever technique they use to make you think
there are only a small group of revolutionaries on campus? And to
make you think they are afraid of the fascist pigs? The first technique
is simply to allow only the same person to write for the Daily. Ever
heard people ask why the Daily prints so many articles by Lenny
Siegel? The second technique is to make the articles anonymous. Ever
heard people ask why the revolutionaries are afraid to identify
themselves? A subtle but effective way to undermine the credibility of
our revolutionary brothers!
Does it all seem a little clearer to you now? Do you 9ee the
interlocking interests, the subtle socializing techniques that make the
Daily so valuable to the administration.
One cause of action will free the people from this tool of
oppression. This time we really must liberate the Daily. We have to
free it from the control of the administration and allow it to become a
true voice of the people and the revolution and not the lackeyorgan of
the administration it is today. Fight for an independent Daily!
Up the Revolution.
People Power.

To the People:
Have you ever really considered what is behind the brouhaha over
demands that the Daily go independent? Just think for a moment
whose interests are served by the Daily and how you would go about
protecting those interests.
There is a curious entanglement between our so called radical
newspaper and a university deeply involved with the imperialist
Defense Department and the Fascist police repression.
If the university really did not like the paily, why would it give the
paper a large, tax free, rent free building to operate out of? Have you
ever visited the Storke building? Ask who built it for the Daily. You
might be surprised at the names of the alumni contributors.
If the university really did not like the Daily, why would it allow
the paper to accumulate $20,000 in debts? What better way to
control a group than to have them in your debt.
If the Daily is in such financial distress that it must ask for $1 per
quarter from every student, why does it print university
announcements for free 1 Remember the adage about you scratch my
back. . . ?7?

But if these cntaglements really represent anything more than mere
coincidence, why was such a fuss made about making the Daily
independent? That same proposal has been made every year for the
last five years and nothing has ever been done about it. And nothing
ever will. The administration won't release its house organ. Instead, a
false sense of conflict is created, a straw man argument is set up and
broken down. The Daily and the administration are publicly displayed
as at odds, while behind the scenes they work together. Have you
heard anything more about plans for making the Daily independent?
Don't hold your breath.
But what else does the university get out of this deal, what makes
the Daily so valuable to them?
The Daily is the most important socializing influence on this
campus. The material in the paper each day floods every person on
this campus with propaganda that supports this capitalist state of
Amerika that we live in.
Advertisements
Count the number of column inches each day devoted to capitalist
enterprise. Every day advertisements fill column after column. Could
anything be more effective at submerging the revolutionary sense than
to publicize the propaganda of the capitalist elite in such a subtle and
indirect manner. Count the square inches devoted to this. It's
astonishing.

Hook and J. Edgar Hoover. Remember the Hoover article 1 Check
