# BBC Spokesman Leads Middle East Discussion
## 
### CAROL LEWIS 
"If someone walked up to me in my native home
and told me his people lived there 2 000 years ago
and that he wanted the land back now, I'm sure I
would have a rude rejoinder for him."
With the British knack for understatement,
Michael Adams, formerly of the Manchester
Guardian and now freelance for the British
Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) spoke on the
Middle East Crisis before a small, but highly diverse,
audience in Tresidder Union Monday night.
The intensity and emotion involved in the
Middle East crisis was highlighted in a heated and
often chaotic period of questions and comments
which followed Adams' presentation.
"The underlying problem (in the Middle East) is
Palestine," said Adams. Beginning his discussion
with a review of the "misunderstood" Balfour
Declaration, a document used to support the
creation of a Zionist state, Adams pointed to
subsequent injustices suffered by Palestinians.
"The creation of a Jewish state could have only
two possible results: dispersion of the Arabs, or
subjugation of the Arabs to the Jews. In either case
the rights of Palestinians are ignored."
Speaking about Western reaction to the problem

he said, "It's a bit of a shock to find your
government doing something with which you don't
at all agree." Adams rejected the Cold War
mentality which legitimized Western armament of
Israel. "Communist takeover in Middle East is
almost totally complete rubbish," he said.
When pressed to speak of the current problem
rather than give an historical analysis, Adams said he
believed the Palestinians should be allowed to return
to their homes and a "multinational" Israel be
created.
The problem with this proposal was dramatized
during the evening when an Arab and Israeli,
standing on opposite sides of the room, argued
vehemently the possibilities for the two cultures to
co-exist.
Throughout the question and answer period,
there was mixed applause and jeering. Twice during
the evening Professor George Rentz, Middle East
history professor, interrupted the audience with a
plea that questions be directed to Adams.
Adams, author of the book, Chaos or Rebirth:
Arab Outlook, did not seem at all miffed by critics
who claimed he was naive or misinformed. Adams
began his foreign correspondence in 195 6 with an
"uninformed and open mind." He bases his position
on 15 years experience in the Middle East.
