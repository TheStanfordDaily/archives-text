"THE NIXON POEMS arc
poisoned arrows, leathered
with wit and right on target."
MARYA MANNE.S
Dedicated to the Constitution
of the United States—and to
the proposition that the pen is
mightier than equal TV time —
THE NIXON POEMS is a
one-woman revolution against
the sensibilities of the man in
the White House (and some
others who would like to be
there) and what nils our na
tional character.
"I didn't think there could he
anything new in anti-Nixnn
jokes, hut Eve Merrinm turns
the subject into very funny and
very painful little poems."
