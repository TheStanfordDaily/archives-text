# Lewis Predicts China Will Join United Nations In Two Years
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
For the past 21 years, Red China has
been quietly pawing at the door of the
United Nations, to no avail. Those
inside have combined to keep her out
in the cold.
But, according to Professor John
Lewis, Red China has her foot in the
door, and will gain the inner circle,
despite the protests of the United
States, within the next two years.
China's 2 0-year struggle for
admission to the world body has
included three separate phases, said
Lewis. The first began in 1945 , when
Chairman Mao Tse-Tung first hinted
that his country wanted recognition
and membership. Lewis remarked, "In
January, 1950, the People's Republic
of China formally expressed a desire to
be seated in the U.N.
"They felt that as soon as they'd
taken over the Chinese mainland, the
government of the People's Republic
should be officially recognized by the
U.N. as the government of China." But
the General Assembly rejected
recognition, and Communist China was
an outcast.
Second Phase
Lewis characterized the second
phase of this struggle as the ten year
period between 1 9 50 and 1960 in
which the United States successfully
postponed the U.N.'s consideration of
China's admission.
In 1960, fearing the erosion of
Nationalist China's influence, the
United States gained a technical victory
when it succeeded in changing the vote
to admit Red China to the U.N. from a
"procedural" to an "important"
question. The passage of this
resolution, which is renewable each
year, required that China receive a 2 /3
majority rather than a simple majority
vote from the members of the General
Assembly for it to be admitted.
But in 1965 , the General Assembly
deadlocked, 47 -47 over the question to
admit Red China. At that point, recalls
Lewis, "a series of compromise
proposals emerged. One of the most
prominent was the two China proposal
in which Red China would take over
Taiwan's (Nationalist China) seat, and

Taiwan would be re-admitted as a new
state.
"Early in 1 965, Communist China
might have accepted the proposal, but
later in the year, because of Vietnam as
well as the onset of the Cultural
Revolution, Red China decided not to
join even if admitted."
During the Cultural Revolution, Red
China adopted a hard line against the
U.S. and condemned what it termed
'U.S. imperialism.' Red Chinese Foreign
Minister Chen Yi, in a 1965 address,
proclaimed that the U.N. must free
itself from U.S. control.
"Peking was calling for either a purge
of the entire U.N. of U.S. imperialism,
or the formation of a revolutionary
United Nations in its place," said
Lewis.
Reacting to this hard line, U.N.
sentiment shifted away from Red
China, and by 1969 a proposal to admit
it was turned back 56-48 with 21
abstentions.
Since the Cultural Revolution,
however, Red China has displayed a
genuine interest in re-establishing
foreign relations with other countries.
The recent diplomatic ties formed with
Canada and Italy amply illustrate this
desire.
Because of these breakthroughs in
diplomacy, Lewis predicts that the gap
evidenced in the balloting of 1969 will
narrow considerably in the next two
years. "During that time," he added, "a
majority vote will be attained, and the
United States will be forced to make a
decision."
Three Alternatives
In Lewis' view, the U.S. has three
alternatives. It can back off, and allow
the majority vote of the Assembly to
prevail. It can re-introduce the 1960
resolution to make Red China's
admission an important question,
thereby forcing the General Assembly
to attain a 2 /3 majority. Or, and Lewis
terms this "unlikely," the U.S. can
support Red China in its bid for a seat
in the U.N.
For the U.S. the major consideration

here is the future of the Nationalist
government of China in Taipei. In the
event that Red China is admitted, the
Nationalist Chinese will probably lose
their seat.
"There is almost no chance for a
seating compromise anymore,"
observed Lewis. "The era of the 'One
China, One Taiwan' alternative is
probably over.
"The way in which we approach the
vote will largely determine the course
of U.S.-Red Chinese relations in the
future. If we don't actively, hostilely
organize against them, we will be
expressing our desire to develop a new
policy with Red China.
"If we try to block them, and Red
China still attains a majority, regardless
of our implementation of the
'Important question' we'll have
suffered a major political defeat."
