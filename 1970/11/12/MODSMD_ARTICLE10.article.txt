# going to the dogs
## Police Book Bow-Wow 
### 
Stanford police yesterday
arrested a dog on the terrace of
Tresidder Union and immediately
booked him on charges of biting
people.
Sgt. Sanguinetti, who made the
arrest, claims that the dog refused
to give his name, "and clammed
up as soon as I read him his
rights."
"He only asked for a lawyer,"
noted the sergeant.
After an initial legal proceeding
failed, which would have
prevented the dog's extradition
from the Stanford pen to the
Santa Clara Humane Society, the
dog was taken to the Santa Clara
pound.
"All in all," said Sergeant
Sanguinetti, commenting on the
suspect," he seemed like a pretty
nice dog."
Hold the Mustard
Stanford police are currently
investigating a report that the dog
had been stolen and hence was a
"hot" dog. It has since been
learned that each policeman has
been armed with ketchup,
mustard, and buns, and that a
large jar of relish is being kept on
hand for emergencies at the
station.
The immediate reaction of the
Stanford canine community to
the arrest was one of outrage
amidst growls that the arrest is
further evidence of the political
harassment of Stanford canines,

who appear to literally be the
underdogs.
A Canine Defense Fund has
been formed, which is going to
sponsor a Rin-Tin-Tin film series
to raise money for the arrested
dog.
Also, leashes with the Canine
Liberation Front symbol, an
upraised fire hydrant, will go on
sale tomorrow in White Plaza.
The head of the Canine
Defense Fund, Rover, said late

Jonathan dedmon

yesterday afternoon that a "Free
All Canine Prisoners" rally has
been scheduled for White Plaza at
noon on Thursday, at which the
speaker will be Lassie. It has also
been rumored that Bugs Bunny
will appear to speak on
non-canine attitudes and fears
towards dogs in a speech entitled,
"Eh, what's up dog?"
(Jon Dedmon is a regular (?) Daily
rumor columnist, which is the
least of his problems.)

what's to be done about the police's recent moves to muzzle in on
dogs putting the bite on Tresidder patrons.
