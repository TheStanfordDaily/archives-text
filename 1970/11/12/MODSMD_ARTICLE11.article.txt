# Wily Coyote Wins Wyoming's Vote
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Back in the days when
antelope outnumbered registered
voters ten-to-one and politicians
packed a Colt .45 around as a part
of their Law and Order appeal,
political campaigning was a
phenomenon as unique as Tom
Mix's ungodly ability to shoot
forty shots at an outlaw without
ever reloading his six-shooter.
High in the plateau country of the
Rocky Mountains, outlaws, guns,
and antelope still play a part in
some people's politics.

The state has so few people
ihat it doesn't really qualify for
even one representative in the
House. Graciously, the
government allows Wyoming to
have one seat anyway, but the
safer and more influential political
ground of the Senate usually
beckons Wyoming's lone
representative into a battle with
an incumbent senator, when the
chance comes along. This was no
different.
Sidewinding Varmit
John Wold, a Sidewinding
Varmit from Casper, strapped on
President Nixon's silver-barrelled
gunbelt, complete with a loud and
sometimes deadly
vice-attachment, and went
gunning for that Wily Coyote,
Gale McGee, the incumbent
Senator looking for his third term.
The first few weeks of the
showdown were uneventful.
Wyoming has no pollution, no
crime, and no college unrest so

campaigns get about as lively as a
half-cooked beefsteak that
somebody's dropped in the
campfire ashes. The Varmit made
the first move however, and
caught Wily off-guard.
A glance at the mud-spattered
bumper of almost any four-wheel
drive Chevy pick-up revealed
Wold's quickdraw trick. There, in
big black letters on flaming orange
background read the rustic slogan,
"The West Wasn't Won with a
Registered Gun."
What wasn't mentioned,
though, was the fact that the
winning of the West came to a
bloody conclusion well before the
turn of the century. The only
charge Wyoming's Indians make
now is on the welfare office. But
no matter. The gunfight is on.
Man's Best Friend
It seems that the Wily Coyote
mentioned that he thought it was
time for a gun control bill after
that easterner was gunned down
in Los Angeles. The Sidewinder
didn't think so. "Everybody
knows that a gun is a Wyoming
man's best friend," snarled a Wold
man from Moose, "because they
can kill those pesky dogs that are
always runnin' off with lambs."
At least the idea is an interesting
variation on man's relationship to
dogs.

All along the Oregon Trail,
billboards appeared showing
frontiersman John Wold knee
deep in a marsh, clutching a
shotgun in one hand and a
mangled duck in the other. "On
the record," the ad boasted,
"John Wold stands with Wyoming
sportsmen." What the billboard
actually pointed out was that
John usually stands with
mutilated ducks, not sportsmen,
but in Wyoming even the duck
vote is significant.
Old Wily McGee would not be
out-gunned. He argued that in fact
he hadn't voted for the Tydings
Amendment on Gun Control and
was in full support of Wyoming's
hunters. To prove it, he put up
more and bigger billboards all
along the Union Pacific Railroad
with a slogan that read "Asa Man
who enjoys the out-of-doors
himself, McGee knows that
hunting constitutes a major
industry in Wyoming."
One Dead Duck
The mark of a seasoned
gunman won out. Instead of one
dead duck, the McGee billboards
showed the senator with three
pheasants and an Irish Setter. Not
bad shootin', right?
When you're outgunned,
there's only one place to turn.
The Varmit Wold put up more
billboards. This time though,

Pious John was sitting with a
group of children and the angelic
caption read, "Allow Local
Schools to Permit Voluntary
Prayer (pronounced Prawh-yrr).
John Wold Believes in our Pledge
of Allegiance." "Now he's got
that Wily McGee," snickered a
Wold man from Big Piney.
Not so fast. When you've got
prawh-yrr on one side and guns on
the other it's a tough choice.
After all, "The West Wasn't Won
with a Registered Prawh-yrr"
either. In a few selected cases a
prawh-yrr has stopped a bullet,
but on the whole, which would
you rather have, bullets or
Prawh-s rr's?
The final showdown, at sunset
on November 3 rd, was the same in
every main street in Wyoming.
From Sundance to Cheyenne to
Jackson Hole, Prawh-yrr bit the
dust. The Wily Coyote, Gale
McGee, put the Sidewinder into
Wyoming's political Boot Hill.
After the fight, the Coyote was
asked about the fight. "Well," he
drawled, "By sticking to my guns
and speaking out on the
issues- regardless of the politics
involved- I gui>ss I've earned the
respect of Wyoming."
That's probably true. After all,
if somebody was sticking his guns
out at you, you'd probably
respect him no matter what kind
of politician he was.
