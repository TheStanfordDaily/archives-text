# Changes In Sexual Behavior Subject Of Nine Month Study
## 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
Dr. Warren B. Miller, assistant
professor of Psychiatry, is
conducting a survey on sexual
behavior and the use of
contraceptives in the freshmen
class. In mid-October, he mailed
questionnaires to three-hundred
randomly-selected students.
The thirty-page questionnaire
is "designed to elicit information
about interests, values, and
attitudes concerning sexual
knowledge and behavior," Miller
said. The survey is "completely
voluntary and anonymous." "The
study's purpose is to better
understand and deal with the
problems associated with changing
sexual practices, unwanted
pregnancies, and the tremendous
population growth." Miller
explained.
Another survey will be sent out
in the spring to the same people
"in order to assess changes which
have taken place during the year."
Miller continued.
Miller's interests are personal,
and his work is not being

financially supported by the
University. "The college
population is going through an
important time in their lives. The
students are challenging
traditional values and r*»orals
concerning sex and drugs." Miller
said. "1 am specifically interested
in how individuals change their
behavior concerning sex. Since we
are now doing between 15 00 and
200 0 abortions a year at the
Medical Center, it is important to
know how women get unwanted
pregnancies in the first place,"
Miller continued.
"This study also concerns
personality theory: that is, how
an individual's personality affects
the decisions he has to make in
our technological society," he
noted. Miller said the resulting
information "must be properly
used, so that the individual
repsonses are completely
confidential, and that the
information is made public
immediately."
There are no results yet, Miller
reported, since the study

continues in the spring, but his
first impressions are "that the
two-hundred students who have
so far responded have taken the
survey very seriously." He said,"l
expect to find a relationship
between a student's acceptance of
traditional family values and the
degree of change and
experimentation that goes on in
the first year of college."
The bulky questionnaire
consists of two personality
inventories, a basic sexual
physiology questionnaire, and two
sexual attitude inventories. The
questions become quite explicit,
asking a detailed history of the
individual's sexual habits and
experiments. Attitudes towards
virginity, masturbation,
mo u th - genital contact,
homosexual behavior, and
contraceptives are explored. "At
all times, however, the strictest
confidence is maintained," Miller
added.
"We are terribly concerned
with the population explosion, so
we are very interested in the
psychological factors involved
with limiting child bearing,"
Miller concluded.
