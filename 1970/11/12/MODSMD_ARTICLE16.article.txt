# Band Won't Travel To Air Force Game
## 
### 
The INCOMPARABLE Leland Stanford Junior University
Marching Band came up with an INSUFFICIENT amount of
money to get to Air Force, and will use the $3,0 00 in
contributions to help finance the Band's stay in Pasadena.
Band Manager Ken Peterson said the contributions, which
were solicited to send the bandsmen either to Air Force or to
Pasadena, fell $1 ,000 short of the money needed to get to
Colorado Springs.
He emphasized that the money would be used for room and
board on the Rose Bowl trip, and not for $3,000 worth of kegs.
