# TMU Worker Says Dismissal Unfair
## 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
Since the beginning of this
quarter, Judy King has been
running the Snack Wagon. On
October 30, she was called at
home by her superior, Skip Cook,
a Si.tnford senior, and fired.
Earlier in the week Miss King
had gone to see Cook in his office
in Tresidder Union.
According to her, Cook
claimed that sales were too low
and that she was in danger of
being fired. She replied that she
had heard nothing about the
problem before and asked for a
two-week trial period in which to
bring up sales. Miss King says
Cook indicated at that time that
she could have until November 6.
During the next two days she
circulated a petition at the Snack
Wagon. It read, "I have been a
customer of Judy King since the
wagon has been coming around
this year. I find her service
courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic and I would dislike to
see her leave." Within two days
Judy collected over 200
signatures.
Miss King sent the petition to
Cook and went to see him on
Friday. She was told that she was
out. In a letter to the Daily, she

indicated that she felt Cook's
superiors had gotten hold of the
petition and told Cook to fire her.
During the week she claims she
raised sales from an average of
$7 0 daily to $9 0 on both
Wednesday and Thursday.
Miss King feels that the direct
cause of her dismissal was the
petition. Steven Klees, a friend of
hers, talked to Skip Cook for
two-and-a-half hours Saturday and
came away with the impression
that Cook was acting on the
instruction of his superiors
(Phillip G. Duffy, Business
Manager TMU, and Forrest
Tregea, Director TMU). Klees
believes that Judy was fired
because of her style of dress and
because of the petition she
circulated.
At this time, TMU directors
will say only that meetings
between Judy and themselves are
now in progress, and that an
investigation is being made into
the matter.
Roland Fensten, past President
of United Stanford Employees,
reported that, after talking with
Tregea, he felt optimistic that
Miss King would either be
reinstated in her old job or given a
new position at TMU. "*

between Judy and themselves are
now in progress, and that an
investigation is being made into
the matter.
Roland Fensten, past President
of United Stanford Employees,
reported that, after talking with
Tregea, he felt optimistic that
Miss King would either be
reinstated in her old job or given a
new position at TMU. "*
Since the beginning of this
quarter, Judy King has been
running the Snack Wagon. On
October 30, she was called at
home by her superior, Skip Cook,
a Si.tnford senior, and fired.
Earlier in the week Miss King
had gone to see Cook in his office
in Tresidder Union.
According to her, Cook
claimed that sales were too low
and that she was in danger of
being fired. She replied that she
had heard nothing about the
problem before and asked for a
two-week trial period in which to
bring up sales. Miss King says
Cook indicated at that time that
she could have until November 6.
During the next two days she
circulated a petition at the Snack
Wagon. It read, "I have been a
customer of Judy King since the
wagon has been coming around
this year. I find her service
courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic and I would dislike to
see her leave." Within two days
Judy collected over 200
signatures.
Miss King sent the petition to
Cook and went to see him on
Friday. She was told that she was
out. In a letter to the Daily, she

indicated that she felt Cook's
superiors had gotten hold of the
petition and told Cook to fire her.
During the week she claims she
raised sales from an average of
$7 0 daily to $9 0 on both
Wednesday and Thursday.
Miss King feels that the direct
cause of her dismissal was the
petition. Steven Klees, a friend of
hers, talked to Skip Cook for
two-and-a-half hours Saturday and
came away with the impression
that Cook was acting on the
instruction of his superiors
(Phillip G. Duffy, Business
Manager TMU, and Forrest
Tregea, Director TMU). Klees
believes that Judy was fired
because of her style of dress and
because of the petition she
circulated.
At this time, TMU directors
will say only that meetings
between Judy and themselves are
now in progress, and that an
investigation is being made into
the matter.

of United Stanford Employees,
