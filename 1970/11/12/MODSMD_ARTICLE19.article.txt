# Cal Tomorrow
## Papooses Catch USC, 35-34 
### TOM QUINN 
Stanford's freshman football
team closes out its season
tomorrow afternoon when they
face the Cal Frosh in the Stadium
at 1:30 p.m. Stanford will enter
the game with a 2-1 season record,
while the Bears are 1-2. Both
teams have beaten Cal Poly San
Luis Obispo and lost to UCLA.
Freshman coach Bill Moultrie
expects the Bearcubs to give his
club quite a test, especially since
it is the last game of the season
for both teams. Moultrie said,
"Cal is well grounded in the
fundamentals and is a very solid
ball club. They stick to the basics
and don't try a lot of fancy
stuff."
Looking at his own club,
Moultrie said, "We really want to
win this last game and thus go out
on the victorious side. We won't
try any special things, but only go
out and play football. We'll find
out tomorrow if Cal is vulnerable
in any spots."
Injuries Hurt
The Stanford injury situation
looks about the same as it has
been in the past with the gimpy
leg being the major problem.
Leonard Austin is definitely out
and Curt Brohard and David
Walker are doubtful starters.
Quarterbacks Mike Gilyard and
Eric Test are both still slowed by
ankle injuries.
However Gilyard will still start
against Cal. He comes off a great
performance in which he led the
Papooses to a 35-34
come-from-behind win over USC.
Despite a rain-soaked field Gilyard
hit on five thouchdown passes for
a new freshman record.

The Indians appeared to be in
deep trouble when the Trojans
moved out to a 34-13 fourth
quarter lead. After a 33 yard TD
from Gilyard to Lasater, the Tribe
scored on a 9 2-yard threeman pass
play. From his own eight Gilyard
hit Terry Pape who made it to the
Stanford 45 where he lateralled to
flanker Rufus Shaw, a 9.5
sprinter, who ran it in for the
score.
Winning TD
With 4:50 remaining, Gilyard
hit high school teammate Shaw
again (for a 14 yard TD) and Jim
Ferguson scored a two point
conversion to give Stanford a
35 -34 win. On the last play of
the game, USC almost won it, but
their receiver bobbled the ball in
the end zone and couldn't hang
on until he was past the end line.
Moultrie called the game, "a
real thriller. The team really
showed a lot of character,
especially in the second half. They
beat USC, the best team in the
league. They had very good
personnel, but we were still able
to come back and keep chipping
away until we had the game."
"A Winner"
He went on to say, "The
coaches got at the players at the
half. They thought we had the
better team and weren't happy at
all with the performance. The
credit for the victory should go to
the young men and the assistant
coaches. Overall we played much
better than the previous weeks
and are taking on the form I
envisioned in October—that of a
winner."

quarterback Mike Gilyard threw five touchdown passes to set a new
freshman mark. Gilyard, Goldstein and the rest of the Papooses finish
their season against Cal tomorrow at 1:30 in the Stadium.
