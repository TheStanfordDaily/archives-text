# GM, UAW Reach Tentative Accord
## 
### 
DETROIT — The United Auto Workers
and General Motors reached a tentative
agreement yesterday on a new
three-year labor contract which could
set the strike-crippled auto giant moving
towards full production by the end of
the month.
Ratification of the national contract
by 394,000 GM workers and the
settlement of outstanding U.S. local
contracts still stand in the way of a full
resumption of car and truck output by
the world's largest automaker.
Earl R. Bramblett, GM's vice
president for personnel and top
bargainer, said the new contract was
inflationary by the standard definition
of the word, but added that this was the
pattern today in labor contracts.
Details of the contract were withheld
until it is presented to the union's
35 0-member GM council, which must
okay the pact before it is passed on to
the membership for ratification.
The council met at 1 p.m.
Wednesday to look at the contract, but
the meeting was adjourned until 9:30

a.m. today to give union officials more
time to write up an explanation of the
offer.
Bargaining table sources said the pact
included these items:
—A return to an unlimited
cost-of-living allowance (COLA) which
moves wages up or down with quarterly
changes in the Consumer Price Index.
The union agreed to a ceiling on COLA
in the 1967 Big Three contracts and
made a return to the unlimited formula
a top demand in this year's bargaining.
—A first-year wage increase of about
50 cents on top of the current average
hourly wage of $4.02. The union had
sought 61.5 cents and GM's last offer
was for 38 cents.
—Retirement for workers with 30
years service at $5 00 a month at age 58
in the first year of the contract, age 56
in the second year and age 55 in the
third year. The union had originally
sought retirement at $5 00 a month after
30 years, regardless of age. Under the
current contract a 55-year-old worker

with 30 years of service could retire at a
maximum of $1 0 4 .22 monthly.
Four weeks vacation for workers
with 20 years of service.
The final details of the contract were
put together in two long sessions, a
17-hour one that began Monday
morning and a final one which began
Tuesday morning and ended early
Wednesday. Bargaining had been
stepped up since Oct. 30.
