# Indians Keep Grip On Pac -8 Numbers
## 
### 
You'll probably agree that
these football statistics stories are
getting a bit tedious week after
week.
But then it's still good
news—for the most part—if that's
any consolation.
After six rounds of Pac-8 play,
Stanford maintains its lead in total
defense, takes over the top spot in
passing defense, and remains
second in rushing defense, passing
offense and total offense.
The Indians are giving up an
average of 299 yards per game
defensively—that's still 128 yards
more than the national leader, the
cynics will point out—which is
nine yards ahead of Oregon
State's second-place 308 figure.
The Tribe is tied with the
Beavers for the passing defense

lead with 174 yards. USC leads
Stanford in rushing defense by
one yard, 124 to 1 25.
USC also leads the local club
by 2 9 yards a game in total
offense with a 470 average and
only Oregon tops the Indians in
passing offense, 291 to 276.
Stanford's lowest category is
rushing offense where it is fifth
with a 164 average, one yard
behind Cal in fourth. The knee
injury to starting fullback Hillary
Shockley last week won't be
much help there, either.
Jim Second
In the national calculations,
quarterback Jim Plunkett. is
second in total offense, averaging
269 yards to Auburn's Pat
Sullivan who averages 2 73.4.
Jim is listed fifth in
passing—which is figured by
completions per game—with a
17.1 mark. Washington's Sonny
Sixkiller continues to lead the
category at 18 .9.
Stanford's other individual
appearing in the national figures is
place kicker Steve Horowitz who
has been kicking 6.2 points per
game, good for tenth place.
In national team figures,
Stanford is third in forward
passing (276.4 ) behind Oregon
(290.9) and Auburn (281), eighth
in total offense with a 4 4 0.8
average (Notre Dame leads with
55 3) and 12th in scoring with a
32 point average.
Back to league individual
statistics, Plunkett continues to
lead in passing and total offense.
Horowitz is second in scoring with
5 6 points, 10 behind Oregon's
Bobby Moore.
In receiving, Randy Vataha is
fourth with 41 receptions; Jackie
Brown is 10 th with 28; and tight
end Bob Moore is tied for 12 th
with 27.

Eric Cross continues his lead in
the punt return section with a
12.4 average and Jackie Brown is
tied for sixth in rushing (509
yards and a 5 6.6 average) and
Shockley is ninth (457 yards and
a 5 0.8 average.)
Team tackles, assisted and
unassisted, go this way: Jeff

Jim is listed fifth in
passing—which is figured by
completions per game—with a
17.1 mark. Washington's Sonny
Sixkiller continues to lead the
category at 18 .9.
Stanford's other individual
appearing in the national figures is
place kicker Steve Horowitz who
has been kicking 6.2 points per
game, good for tenth place.
In national team figures,
Stanford is third in forward
passing (276.4 ) behind Oregon
(290.9) and Auburn (281), eighth
in total offense with a 4 4 0.8
average (Notre Dame leads with
55 3) and 12th in scoring with a
32 point average.
Back to league individual
statistics, Plunkett continues to
lead in passing and total offense.
Horowitz is second in scoring with
5 6 points, 10 behind Oregon's
Bobby Moore.
In receiving, Randy Vataha is
fourth with 41 receptions; Jackie

Eric Cross continues his lead in
the punt return section with a
12.4 average and Jackie Brown is
tied for sixth in rushing (509
yards and a 5 6.6 average) and
Shockley is ninth (457 yards and

Team tackles, assisted and

You'll probably agree that
these football statistics stories are
getting a bit tedious week after
week.
But then it's still good
news—for the most part—if that's
any consolation.
After six rounds of Pac-8 play,
Stanford maintains its lead in total
defense, takes over the top spot in
passing defense, and remains
second in rushing defense, passing
offense and total offense.
The Indians are giving up an
average of 299 yards per game
defensively—that's still 128 yards
more than the national leader, the
cynics will point out—which is
nine yards ahead of Oregon
State's second-place 308 figure.
The Tribe is tied with the
Beavers for the passing defense

lead with 174 yards. USC leads
Stanford in rushing defense by
one yard, 124 to 1 25.
USC also leads the local club
by 2 9 yards a game in total
offense with a 470 average and
only Oregon tops the Indians in
passing offense, 291 to 276.
Stanford's lowest category is
rushing offense where it is fifth
with a 164 average, one yard
behind Cal in fourth. The knee
injury to starting fullback Hillary
Shockley last week won't be
much help there, either.
