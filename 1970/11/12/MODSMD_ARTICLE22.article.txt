# New Ecology Film A Waste Product
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Ecology, conservation, and
pollution are fashionable topics
these days. It was only a matter of
time before a film would be made
on the subject of man and his
deteriorating environment. The
time has come. The film is
entitled, "NO BLADE OF
GRASS" and is the waste product
of one year of Cornell Wilde's
career.
I find it difficult to criticize a
film made by a man with such
good intentions. Producer-director
Wilde explained in a recent
interview that he was affected by
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and
spent years looking for a script
that would "get people
emotionally aroused" about the
inevitability of an ecological
disaster.
"I didn't want to make a
documentary because people only
react intellectually to
documentaries and aren't stirred
to do anything."
He employed the talents of
Sean Forestal and Jefferson Pascal
to adapt John Christopher's 1956
novel about a world famine
caused by a virus, bred of
pesticide abuse and air pollution
conditions, that attacks all grains
and grasses. "What was
science-fiction fourteen years ago
is science-fact today."
The film version of "NO
BLADE OF GRASS" relates the
efforts of an English architect
(Nigel Davenport), his family and
assorted friends as they flee
panic-stricken London, one of the
cities seriously affected by a
world famine, and attempt to

make their way to food and safety
in the country. "The film was set
in England because such an event
would have a greater impact in
England. The U.S. wouldn't have
been as believable in terms of the
availability of food and other
products."
In the course of their journey
the respectable, but desperate,
Englishmen resort to shooting
anyone who stands between them
and the peace and security of the
country fortress. Intercut with
shots of polluted streams and
dead lambs are scenes of people
getting blown apart by shotfuns,
Hell's Angel types staging a
cowboy and Indian style attack
on the band of travellers, and a
very symbolic rape and childbirth.
The newspaper advertising for the
film reads: "Yesterday, they were
decent people letting their
environment die. Now, they are
savages, killing to keep themselves
alive."
It's incredible that Mr. Wilde
expects his audience to believe
that in the event of a food
shortage England would be
overcome in three days by
anarchy and that people would
roam the countryside killing each
other over food and weapons.
And how can we have any
compassion or concern for dead
fish and animals when the
characters in the film have no
compassion or concern for any
human life except their own?
Cornell Wilde defended and
attempted to justify his film by
citing parallels between the events
in the movie, the blight that
affected the U.S. corn crop this
summer and the violent activities
of the skin heads in England.
However, there's no justification
for filming sickening amounts of
death and violence and pawning it
off on the public as a warning of
what can happen if we don't stop
dumping sewage in rivers.

pesticide abuse and air pollution
conditions, that attacks all grains
and grasses. "What was
science-fiction fourteen years ago
is science-fact today."
The film version of "NO
BLADE OF GRASS" relates the
efforts of an English architect
(Nigel Davenport), his family and
assorted friends as they flee
panic-stricken London, one of the
cities seriously affected by a
world famine, and attempt to

make their way to food and safety
in the country. "The film was set
in England because such an event
would have a greater impact in
England. The U.S. wouldn't have
been as believable in terms of the
availability of food and other
products."
In the course of their journey
the respectable, but desperate,
Englishmen resort to shooting
anyone who stands between them
and the peace and security of the
country fortress. Intercut with
shots of polluted streams and
dead lambs are scenes of people
getting blown apart by shotfuns,
Hell's Angel types staging a
cowboy and Indian style attack
on the band of travellers, and a
very symbolic rape and childbirth.
The newspaper advertising for the
film reads: "Yesterday, they were
decent people letting their
environment die. Now, they are
savages, killing to keep themselves
alive."
It's incredible that Mr. Wilde
expects his audience to believe
that in the event of a food
shortage England would be
overcome in three days by
anarchy and that people would
roam the countryside killing each
other over food and weapons.
And how can we have any
compassion or concern for dead
fish and animals when the
characters in the film have no
compassion or concern for any
human life except their own?
Cornell Wilde defended and
attempted to justify his film by
citing parallels between the events
in the movie, the blight that
affected the U.S. corn crop this
summer and the violent activities
of the skin heads in England.
However, there's no justification
for filming sickening amounts of
death and violence and pawning it
off on the public as a warning of
what can happen if we don't stop
dumping sewage in rivers.

The 1939 version of "THE
ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK
HOLMES" will be shown
Thursday at 7:30 and 10 in
Cubberley. "FALL OF THE
HOUSE OF USHER" (1929) and
"LAPIS," a psychedelic short, are
included in the program.
Ecology, conservation, and
pollution are fashionable topics
these days. It was only a matter of
time before a film would be made
on the subject of man and his
deteriorating environment. The
time has come. The film is
entitled, "NO BLADE OF
GRASS" and is the waste product
of one year of Cornell Wilde's
career.
I find it difficult to criticize a
film made by a man with such
good intentions. Producer-director
Wilde explained in a recent
interview that he was affected by
Rachel Carson's Silent Spring and
spent years looking for a script
that would "get people
emotionally aroused" about the
inevitability of an ecological
disaster.
"I didn't want to make a
documentary because people only
react intellectually to
documentaries and aren't stirred
to do anything."
He employed the talents of
Sean Forestal and Jefferson Pascal
to adapt John Christopher's 1956
novel about a world famine
caused by a virus, bred of
pesticide abuse and air pollution
conditions, that attacks all grains
and grasses. "What was
science-fiction fourteen years ago
