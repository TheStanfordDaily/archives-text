What the Daily needs is a good
five-cent rock reviewer, or even a
higher priced product! Also, the
Features Editor could sure use
book reviewers, food reviewers,
and just general reviewers of the
passing scene. If you qualify and
the alluring prospect of your
name in print is sufficient
enticement, stop by any
afternoon at the Daily office,
and ask for Jane.
