# Med Center: Study In Sterility
## 
### LEE GREATHOUSE 
B I had expected Broderick
Crawford. Crawford stars on
another medical show, the Young
Interns (counterpart to the Young
Lawyers?). Instead, the medical
show I chose to watch, Medical
Center, featured Dr. Gannon and
Dr. Ganford. Dr. Gannon is
young, intelligent, and
conscientious. Dr. Canford is in
his late forties, one of the best
neurosurgeons in the country, just
back from Vietnam, a swinger,
and an alcoholic who has not yet
admitted it to himslef. Both men
are surgeons in Medical Center.
Gannon Is on the staff; Canford is
there provisionally pending
approval of his appointment.
I tried watching Medical Center
with an open mind's eye. No luck.
This PHisohex soap opera goes
nowhere from first incision to
final suture. If you like watching
people yell at each other there are
enough firey emotional scenes to
keep you from succumbing to the
anesthesia of the plot. As
television investment counselor I
recommend against sinking 55
minutes of your precious
attention in Center. You can buy
better sedatives in the drug store.
Or if, like Dunbar in Catch 22,
you want to make life last longer
by staying bored, you can find
more constructive ways. Do your
laundry. Read sociology theory.
The episode of "Center" I
watched presented us with four
thrilling problems of the human
condition: Will Dr. Gannon lose
his head? Will the little girl lose
her arm? Will Dr. Canford lose his
courage? Will we lose our dinner?
Watch and find out. The girl is
sixteen. She's cute, bubbly, on the
mend from a motorcycle spill, and
has a sarcoma in her elbow (watch
shows like this and you will be
able to amaze your friends with
the number of names of diseases
you can drop onto their dinner
plates.) She is also in love with Dr.
Canford who has troubles with his
mouth and the amount of alcohol
that goes into it. Neurosurgeons
have the highest patient mortality
rate and the highest suicide rate of
the medical specialties.
Canford is a neurosurgeon just
back from Nam where he lost as
many of his friends as he saved. It
weighs upon him; weighs almost
as much as his head before the big

operation; but we're getting ahead
of our story. Dr. Gannon is a man
with many burdens too. He must
decide whether or not Canford
stays. Canford was a close friend
before he left for Vietnam.
Canford was also a close friend of
Gannon's girlfriend, much to
Gannon's dismay.
And, to add icing to the
cupcake, it is apparent that
Gannon is the star of the hospital
and Canford, brilliant surgeon as
he is, might steal some of
Gannon's thunder. Will the young
doctor's professional objectivity
crumble under these awsome
pressures' Will envy and horniness
sully his hospital white ethics?
Of course not. You're watching
television, remember?
Canford has patched the
motorcycle girl back together but
Gannon has discovered from
x-rays that her elbow is
deteriorating. Only Gannon is not
the one who should have made
the discovery. Canford should
have. The girl was his patient. He
was supposed to see her on his
rounds. What happened to him?
Could it be that he was hung over
from the night before? We last
saw him talking loudly and

swinging on a supperclub dance
floor with Gannon's girlfriend in
one hand and a glass in the other.
Today he did not show! Shucks,
turns out he had an emergency
call in obstetrics.
Were you sympathizing with
Gannon? Shame on you. You
should admit you were wrong as
Gannon does when he watches
Canford's inspired hands in
another operation. You should,
that Ls, except, except. . . The
patient dies and Canford roars off
in his car gulping from his flask as
he goes.
Can you guess the plot yet?
No? How about one more piece of
information. The only other
doctor in the country besides
Canford who can do a bone graft
on the girl's arm is on vacation in
the unreachable north woods.
The show must go on; we don't
care where that doctor is! Bubbly
young thing now suitably sedated
is wrapped in surgical swaddling
and carted off to surgery. Gannon
dresses and begins operating
procedure. He leaves the operating
room to find Canford. Seconds
later he bursts back into the room
shouting, "Bring her back up. The
operation is scrubbed!" We next

see the sodden, weaving Canford
collapsed on a bench in the
dressing room.
He is sorry. He apologizes. He
tried. Gannon answers by politely
pinning him to the wall and, in
case you haven't noticed it yet,
outlines this climactic moment
with a searing lecture designed to
fry tht' alcohol out of Canford's
brain.
The great surgeon returns from
the woods. The girl's operation is
successful. Gannon's superiors
realize it was not jealousy that
made him want to keep them
from getting Canford the shining
star on their staff. Gannon's girl
professes undying love for him.
Canford switches to grass and
starts the road to recovery by
declaring soberly to his friends
that he is an alcoholic. And you
arnl I go to a movie for some
entertainment.
Medical Center has the best
equipment twentieth century
technology can provide. It also
has the finest of staff personnel.
But it desperately needs one more
specialist—a script doctor.

one hand and a glass in the other.
Today he did not show! Shucks,
turns out he had an emergency
call in obstetrics.
Were you sympathizing with
Gannon? Shame on you. You
should admit you were wrong as
Gannon does when he watches
Canford's inspired hands in
another operation. You should,
that Ls, except, except. . . The
patient dies and Canford roars off
in his car gulping from his flask as
he goes.
Can you guess the plot yet?
No? How about one more piece of
information. The only other
doctor in the country besides
Canford who can do a bone graft
on the girl's arm is on vacation in
the unreachable north woods.
The show must go on; we don't
care where that doctor is! Bubbly
young thing now suitably sedated
is wrapped in surgical swaddling
and carted off to surgery. Gannon
dresses and begins operating
procedure. He leaves the operating
room to find Canford. Seconds
later he bursts back into the room
shouting, "Bring her back up. The
operation is scrubbed!" We next

see the sodden, weaving Canford
collapsed on a bench in the
dressing room.
He is sorry. He apologizes. He
tried. Gannon answers by politely
pinning him to the wall and, in
case you haven't noticed it yet,
outlines this climactic moment
with a searing lecture designed to
fry tht' alcohol out of Canford's
brain.
The great surgeon returns from
the woods. The girl's operation is
successful. Gannon's superiors
realize it was not jealousy that
made him want to keep them
from getting Canford the shining
star on their staff. Gannon's girl
professes undying love for him.
Canford switches to grass and
starts the road to recovery by
declaring soberly to his friends
that he is an alcoholic. And you
arnl I go to a movie for some
entertainment.
Medical Center has the best
equipment twentieth century
technology can provide. It also
has the finest of staff personnel.
But it desperately needs one more
specialist—a script doctor.

B I had expected Broderick
Crawford. Crawford stars on
another medical show, the Young
Interns (counterpart to the Young
Lawyers?). Instead, the medical
show I chose to watch, Medical
Center, featured Dr. Gannon and
Dr. Ganford. Dr. Gannon is
young, intelligent, and
conscientious. Dr. Canford is in
his late forties, one of the best
neurosurgeons in the country, just
back from Vietnam, a swinger,
and an alcoholic who has not yet
admitted it to himslef. Both men
are surgeons in Medical Center.
Gannon Is on the staff; Canford is
there provisionally pending
approval of his appointment.
I tried watching Medical Center
with an open mind's eye. No luck.
This PHisohex soap opera goes
nowhere from first incision to
final suture. If you like watching
people yell at each other there are
enough firey emotional scenes to
keep you from succumbing to the
anesthesia of the plot. As
television investment counselor I
recommend against sinking 55
minutes of your precious
attention in Center. You can buy
better sedatives in the drug store.
Or if, like Dunbar in Catch 22,
you want to make life last longer
by staying bored, you can find
more constructive ways. Do your
laundry. Read sociology theory.
The episode of "Center" I
watched presented us with four
thrilling problems of the human
condition: Will Dr. Gannon lose
his head? Will the little girl lose
her arm? Will Dr. Canford lose his
courage? Will we lose our dinner?
Watch and find out. The girl is
sixteen. She's cute, bubbly, on the
mend from a motorcycle spill, and
has a sarcoma in her elbow (watch
shows like this and you will be
able to amaze your friends with
the number of names of diseases
you can drop onto their dinner
plates.) She is also in love with Dr.
Canford who has troubles with his
mouth and the amount of alcohol
that goes into it. Neurosurgeons
have the highest patient mortality
rate and the highest suicide rate of
the medical specialties.
Canford is a neurosurgeon just
back from Nam where he lost as
many of his friends as he saved. It
weighs upon him; weighs almost
as much as his head before the big

operation; but we're getting ahead
of our story. Dr. Gannon is a man
with many burdens too. He must
decide whether or not Canford
stays. Canford was a close friend
before he left for Vietnam.
Canford was also a close friend of
Gannon's girlfriend, much to
Gannon's dismay.
And, to add icing to the
cupcake, it is apparent that
Gannon is the star of the hospital
and Canford, brilliant surgeon as
he is, might steal some of
Gannon's thunder. Will the young
doctor's professional objectivity
crumble under these awsome
pressures' Will envy and horniness
sully his hospital white ethics?
Of course not. You're watching
television, remember?
Canford has patched the
motorcycle girl back together but
Gannon has discovered from
x-rays that her elbow is
deteriorating. Only Gannon is not
the one who should have made
the discovery. Canford should
have. The girl was his patient. He
was supposed to see her on his
rounds. What happened to him?
Could it be that he was hung over
from the night before? We last
saw him talking loudly and

swinging on a supperclub dance
floor with Gannon's girlfriend in
one hand and a glass in the other.
Today he did not show! Shucks,
turns out he had an emergency

thrilling problems of the human
condition: Will Dr. Gannon lose
his head? Will the little girl lose
her arm? Will Dr. Canford lose his
courage? Will we lose our dinner?
Watch and find out. The girl is
sixteen. She's cute, bubbly, on the
mend from a motorcycle spill, and
has a sarcoma in her elbow (watch
shows like this and you will be
able to amaze your friends with
the number of names of diseases
you can drop onto their dinner
plates.) She is also in love with Dr.
Canford who has troubles with his
mouth and the amount of alcohol
that goes into it. Neurosurgeons
have the highest patient mortality
rate and the highest suicide rate of
the medical specialties.
Canford is a neurosurgeon just
back from Nam where he lost as
many of his friends as he saved. It
weighs upon him; weighs almost
as much as his head before the big

operation; but we're getting ahead
of our story. Dr. Gannon is a man
with many burdens too. He must
decide whether or not Canford
stays. Canford was a close friend
before he left for Vietnam.
Canford was also a close friend of
Gannon's girlfriend, much to
Gannon's dismay.
And, to add icing to the
cupcake, it is apparent that
Gannon is the star of the hospital
and Canford, brilliant surgeon as
he is, might steal some of
Gannon's thunder. Will the young
doctor's professional objectivity
crumble under these awsome
pressures' Will envy and horniness
sully his hospital white ethics?
Of course not. You're watching
television, remember?
Canford has patched the
motorcycle girl back together but
Gannon has discovered from
x-rays that her elbow is
deteriorating. Only Gannon is not
the one who should have made
the discovery. Canford should
have. The girl was his patient. He
was supposed to see her on his
rounds. What happened to him?
Could it be that he was hung over
from the night before? We last
saw him talking loudly and

swinging on a supperclub dance
floor with Gannon's girlfriend in
one hand and a glass in the other.
Today he did not show! Shucks,
turns out he had an emergency
call in obstetrics.
Were you sympathizing with
Gannon? Shame on you. You
should admit you were wrong as
Gannon does when he watches
Canford's inspired hands in
another operation. You should,
that Ls, except, except. . . The
patient dies and Canford roars off
in his car gulping from his flask as
he goes.
Can you guess the plot yet?
No? How about one more piece of
information. The only other
doctor in the country besides
Canford who can do a bone graft
on the girl's arm is on vacation in
the unreachable north woods.
The show must go on; we don't
care where that doctor is! Bubbly
young thing now suitably sedated
is wrapped in surgical swaddling
and carted off to surgery. Gannon
dresses and begins operating
procedure. He leaves the operating
room to find Canford. Seconds
later he bursts back into the room
shouting, "Bring her back up. The
operation is scrubbed!" We next

see the sodden, weaving Canford
collapsed on a bench in the
dressing room.
He is sorry. He apologizes. He
tried. Gannon answers by politely
pinning him to the wall and, in
case you haven't noticed it yet,
outlines this climactic moment
with a searing lecture designed to
fry tht' alcohol out of Canford's
brain.
The great surgeon returns from
the woods. The girl's operation is
successful. Gannon's superiors
realize it was not jealousy that
made him want to keep them
from getting Canford the shining
star on their staff. Gannon's girl
professes undying love for him.
Canford switches to grass and
starts the road to recovery by
declaring soberly to his friends
that he is an alcoholic. And you
arnl I go to a movie for some
entertainment.
Medical Center has the best
equipment twentieth century
technology can provide. It also
has the finest of staff personnel.
But it desperately needs one more
specialist—a script doctor.

B I had expected Broderick
Crawford. Crawford stars on
another medical show, the Young
Interns (counterpart to the Young
Lawyers?). Instead, the medical
show I chose to watch, Medical
Center, featured Dr. Gannon and
Dr. Ganford. Dr. Gannon is
young, intelligent, and
conscientious. Dr. Canford is in
his late forties, one of the best
neurosurgeons in the country, just
back from Vietnam, a swinger,
and an alcoholic who has not yet
admitted it to himslef. Both men
are surgeons in Medical Center.
Gannon Is on the staff; Canford is
there provisionally pending
approval of his appointment.
I tried watching Medical Center
with an open mind's eye. No luck.
This PHisohex soap opera goes
nowhere from first incision to
final suture. If you like watching
people yell at each other there are
enough firey emotional scenes to
keep you from succumbing to the
anesthesia of the plot. As
television investment counselor I
recommend against sinking 55
minutes of your precious
attention in Center. You can buy
better sedatives in the drug store.
Or if, like Dunbar in Catch 22,
you want to make life last longer
by staying bored, you can find
more constructive ways. Do your
laundry. Read sociology theory.
