De Gaulle Funeral
PARIS — A soldier home from the wars, Gen. Charles
de Gaulle is going to his grave today in a $63 wooden
coffin.
His funeral at Colombey, simple in accordance with
his own directions, will follow memorial services four
hours earlier in Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral.
Security officials drew on their reserves to protect
such visitors as President Nixon and Soviet President
Nikolai V. Podgorny.
While church bells toll all over Erance the dignitaries
will attend a Requiem Mass at the 600-year-old
cathedral. The service, like the one in De Gualle's home
village of Colombey les Deux Eglises, will be bare of
eulogy or the playing of "Taps." These were the
restrictions—"no bands, no bugles"—that De Gaulle set
down in a handwritten directive 18 years ago.
Then, later, De Gaulle will be buried beside his
daughter Anne, dead 22 years, and a forgotten farm
laborer.
A Foreign Office list of mourners at Notre Dame
included more than 80 chiefs of state, heads of
government and other great officials. The final list was
expected to approach the representation of 92
high-level delegations that attended the funerals of
John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The official list of mourners included Prince Charles
of Britain, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of
Ethiopia, Queen Juliana of Holland, King Baudouin of
Belgium and former Premier David Ben-Gurion of
Israel.

ANKA , Turkey — The pilot of the U.S. Army plane
that mistakenly flew into the Soviet Union last month
with two generals mixed up railroad tracks he was
using as a ground guide, informants said yesterday.
TTie aircraft was headed for Kars in eastern Turkey
but came down Oct. 21 in Soviet Armenia.

The plane was not intercepted by Soviet jets and
apparently flew inside the Soviet Union for about 10
minutes without detection, the sources said, adding:
The pilot, Maj. James Russell; Maj. Gen. Edward C. D.
Scherrer, and Brig. Gen Claude Mc McQuarrie Jr., and a
Turkish officer, Col. Cevat Denli, thought that they
were at Kars when the plane touched down and
awaited a vehicle to lead them to the terminal.
A vehicle appeared, but on it instead of the Turkish
red star and crescent there was only a large red star, the
Soviet symbol.
The pilot suggested trying to take off again, but
Scherrer said it was dangerous and ordered him to stay
on the ground.
An astonished Russian officer stepped out of the
vehicle. With sign language he ordered the Americans
and the Turkish officer into the terminal building.
They sat there for an hour before a translator
appeared.
"Who are you?" he asked.
"Where are we?" the Americans asked.
Thurmond Carrotted
RIVERSIDE Calif. — Students shouted and threw
carrots Wednesday at Sen. Strom Thurmond, during an
outdoor speech at the University of California at
Riverside.
The students heckled Thurmond, 67, as he urged
support of President Nixon's administration policies.
Several carrots were thrown toward the podium during
a question-and-answer period. Thurmond referred to
the hecklers as "a bunch of wild animals."
One student in the audience of about 700 asked
Thurmond how it felt "to know that you're going
down in history as one of the biggest bigots and racists
of our time."
"At least I will by loyal to my country," snapped
Thurmond to catcalls from the audience. "At least I
will treat all the people with manners which is more
than you are doing."

Die - Off In Bay
REDWOOD CITY — Federal and state biologists are
trying to find out why an estimated 10,000 perch died
in one of the biggest fish kills ever recorded in San
Francisco Bay.
The dead fish began surfacing Sunday in the
Redwood City municipal marina, 20 miles south of San
Francisco. More appeared Monday. Then the
unexplained kill tapered off, said D.A. Clanton, chief
inspector for the State Fish and Game Department.
Clanton said no other species except perch was
found dead.
He added there was evidence of some raw sewage in
the marina. The city of Redwood City discharges
treated sewage in a nearby slough.
State biologist Jack Ladd said most of the perch had
hemorrhaging of the gills, indicating possible toxic
poisoning either from sewage or some other source.
Samples of the dead black shiner and wall-eye perch
and marina water were turned over to the Federal
Water Quality Administration laboratory in Alameda
for further analysis.
Soledad Killing
SOLEDAD Calif. — A young convict was stabbed to
death yesterday in a gang fight at racially tense Soledad
prison—the seventh person killed in 10 months.
Robert Daniel Hark ins, 22 , of Garden Grove, Calif.,
was found on the floor of an exercise room of the
maximum security section of the prison.
Deputy Supt. Jiro Enomot said a racially mixed
group of 14 prisoners was in the exercise area when a
fight broke out. He said a guard outside the area saw a
struggle involving a large number of the prisoners.
Harkins, who is white, had a history of fights in
prison, Enomoto said. But there was no evidence of a
racial motive in the slaying, although the other
prisoners nearby included blacks and
Mexican-Americans, he said.

village of Colombey les Deux Eglises, will be bare of
eulogy or the playing of "Taps." These were the
restrictions—"no bands, no bugles"—that De Gaulle set
down in a handwritten directive 18 years ago.
Then, later, De Gaulle will be buried beside his
daughter Anne, dead 22 years, and a forgotten farm
laborer.
A Foreign Office list of mourners at Notre Dame
included more than 80 chiefs of state, heads of
government and other great officials. The final list was
expected to approach the representation of 92
high-level delegations that attended the funerals of
John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The official list of mourners included Prince Charles
of Britain, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of
Ethiopia, Queen Juliana of Holland, King Baudouin of
Belgium and former Premier David Ben-Gurion of
Israel.
'Where Are We? 9
ANKA , Turkey — The pilot of the U.S. Army plane
that mistakenly flew into the Soviet Union last month
with two generals mixed up railroad tracks he was
using as a ground guide, informants said yesterday.
TTie aircraft was headed for Kars in eastern Turkey
but came down Oct. 21 in Soviet Armenia.

The plane was not intercepted by Soviet jets and
apparently flew inside the Soviet Union for about 10
minutes without detection, the sources said, adding:
The pilot, Maj. James Russell; Maj. Gen. Edward C. D.
Scherrer, and Brig. Gen Claude Mc McQuarrie Jr., and a
Turkish officer, Col. Cevat Denli, thought that they
were at Kars when the plane touched down and
awaited a vehicle to lead them to the terminal.
A vehicle appeared, but on it instead of the Turkish
red star and crescent there was only a large red star, the
Soviet symbol.
The pilot suggested trying to take off again, but
Scherrer said it was dangerous and ordered him to stay
on the ground.
An astonished Russian officer stepped out of the
vehicle. With sign language he ordered the Americans
and the Turkish officer into the terminal building.
They sat there for an hour before a translator
appeared.
"Who are you?" he asked.
"Where are we?" the Americans asked.
Thurmond Carrotted
RIVERSIDE Calif. — Students shouted and threw
carrots Wednesday at Sen. Strom Thurmond, during an
outdoor speech at the University of California at
Riverside.
The students heckled Thurmond, 67, as he urged
support of President Nixon's administration policies.
Several carrots were thrown toward the podium during
a question-and-answer period. Thurmond referred to
the hecklers as "a bunch of wild animals."
One student in the audience of about 700 asked
Thurmond how it felt "to know that you're going
down in history as one of the biggest bigots and racists
of our time."
"At least I will by loyal to my country," snapped
Thurmond to catcalls from the audience. "At least I
will treat all the people with manners which is more
than you are doing."

Die - Off In Bay
REDWOOD CITY — Federal and state biologists are
trying to find out why an estimated 10,000 perch died
in one of the biggest fish kills ever recorded in San
Francisco Bay.
The dead fish began surfacing Sunday in the
Redwood City municipal marina, 20 miles south of San
Francisco. More appeared Monday. Then the
unexplained kill tapered off, said D.A. Clanton, chief
inspector for the State Fish and Game Department.
Clanton said no other species except perch was
found dead.
He added there was evidence of some raw sewage in
the marina. The city of Redwood City discharges
treated sewage in a nearby slough.
State biologist Jack Ladd said most of the perch had
hemorrhaging of the gills, indicating possible toxic
poisoning either from sewage or some other source.
Samples of the dead black shiner and wall-eye perch
and marina water were turned over to the Federal
Water Quality Administration laboratory in Alameda
for further analysis.
Soledad Killing
SOLEDAD Calif. — A young convict was stabbed to
death yesterday in a gang fight at racially tense Soledad
prison—the seventh person killed in 10 months.
Robert Daniel Hark ins, 22 , of Garden Grove, Calif.,
was found on the floor of an exercise room of the
maximum security section of the prison.
Deputy Supt. Jiro Enomot said a racially mixed
group of 14 prisoners was in the exercise area when a
fight broke out. He said a guard outside the area saw a
struggle involving a large number of the prisoners.
Harkins, who is white, had a history of fights in
prison, Enomoto said. But there was no evidence of a
racial motive in the slaying, although the other
prisoners nearby included blacks and
Mexican-Americans, he said.

high-level delegations that attended the funerals of
John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The official list of mourners included Prince Charles
of Britain, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of
Ethiopia, Queen Juliana of Holland, King Baudouin of
Belgium and former Premier David Ben-Gurion of
Israel.
'Where Are We? 9
ANKA , Turkey — The pilot of the U.S. Army plane
that mistakenly flew into the Soviet Union last month
with two generals mixed up railroad tracks he was
using as a ground guide, informants said yesterday.
TTie aircraft was headed for Kars in eastern Turkey
but came down Oct. 21 in Soviet Armenia.

The plane was not intercepted by Soviet jets and
apparently flew inside the Soviet Union for about 10
minutes without detection, the sources said, adding:
The pilot, Maj. James Russell; Maj. Gen. Edward C. D.
Scherrer, and Brig. Gen Claude Mc McQuarrie Jr., and a
Turkish officer, Col. Cevat Denli, thought that they
were at Kars when the plane touched down and
awaited a vehicle to lead them to the terminal.
A vehicle appeared, but on it instead of the Turkish
red star and crescent there was only a large red star, the
Soviet symbol.
The pilot suggested trying to take off again, but
Scherrer said it was dangerous and ordered him to stay
on the ground.
An astonished Russian officer stepped out of the
vehicle. With sign language he ordered the Americans
and the Turkish officer into the terminal building.
They sat there for an hour before a translator
appeared.
"Who are you?" he asked.
"Where are we?" the Americans asked.
Thurmond Carrotted
RIVERSIDE Calif. — Students shouted and threw
carrots Wednesday at Sen. Strom Thurmond, during an
outdoor speech at the University of California at
Riverside.
The students heckled Thurmond, 67, as he urged
support of President Nixon's administration policies.
Several carrots were thrown toward the podium during
a question-and-answer period. Thurmond referred to
the hecklers as "a bunch of wild animals."
One student in the audience of about 700 asked
Thurmond how it felt "to know that you're going
down in history as one of the biggest bigots and racists
of our time."
"At least I will by loyal to my country," snapped
Thurmond to catcalls from the audience. "At least I
will treat all the people with manners which is more
than you are doing."

Die - Off In Bay
REDWOOD CITY — Federal and state biologists are
trying to find out why an estimated 10,000 perch died
in one of the biggest fish kills ever recorded in San
Francisco Bay.
The dead fish began surfacing Sunday in the
Redwood City municipal marina, 20 miles south of San
Francisco. More appeared Monday. Then the
unexplained kill tapered off, said D.A. Clanton, chief
inspector for the State Fish and Game Department.
Clanton said no other species except perch was
found dead.
He added there was evidence of some raw sewage in
the marina. The city of Redwood City discharges
treated sewage in a nearby slough.
State biologist Jack Ladd said most of the perch had
hemorrhaging of the gills, indicating possible toxic
poisoning either from sewage or some other source.
Samples of the dead black shiner and wall-eye perch
and marina water were turned over to the Federal
Water Quality Administration laboratory in Alameda
for further analysis.
Soledad Killing
SOLEDAD Calif. — A young convict was stabbed to
death yesterday in a gang fight at racially tense Soledad
prison—the seventh person killed in 10 months.
Robert Daniel Hark ins, 22 , of Garden Grove, Calif.,
was found on the floor of an exercise room of the
maximum security section of the prison.
Deputy Supt. Jiro Enomot said a racially mixed
group of 14 prisoners was in the exercise area when a
fight broke out. He said a guard outside the area saw a
struggle involving a large number of the prisoners.
Harkins, who is white, had a history of fights in
prison, Enomoto said. But there was no evidence of a
racial motive in the slaying, although the other
prisoners nearby included blacks and
Mexican-Americans, he said.
De Gaulle Funeral
PARIS — A soldier home from the wars, Gen. Charles
de Gaulle is going to his grave today in a $63 wooden
coffin.
His funeral at Colombey, simple in accordance with
his own directions, will follow memorial services four
hours earlier in Paris' Notre Dame Cathedral.
Security officials drew on their reserves to protect
such visitors as President Nixon and Soviet President
Nikolai V. Podgorny.
While church bells toll all over Erance the dignitaries
will attend a Requiem Mass at the 600-year-old
cathedral. The service, like the one in De Gualle's home
village of Colombey les Deux Eglises, will be bare of
eulogy or the playing of "Taps." These were the
restrictions—"no bands, no bugles"—that De Gaulle set
down in a handwritten directive 18 years ago.
Then, later, De Gaulle will be buried beside his
daughter Anne, dead 22 years, and a forgotten farm
laborer.
A Foreign Office list of mourners at Notre Dame
included more than 80 chiefs of state, heads of
government and other great officials. The final list was
expected to approach the representation of 92
high-level delegations that attended the funerals of
John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower.
The official list of mourners included Prince Charles
of Britain, the Shah of Iran, Emperor Haile Selassie of
