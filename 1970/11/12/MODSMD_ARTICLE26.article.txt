# Toyon Hall Cleared After Late-Night Bomb Threat
## 
### 
The 210 undergraduates living in
Toyon Hall were evacuated late last
night after a University switchboard
operator received a telephoned bomb
threat. No bomb was found.
At 10:45 p.m., an unidentified male
called the switchboard with the
message, "A bumb in Toyon Hall will
go off at midnight."
Bruce Wiggins, the University's
director of public safety, said residents
of the coed dorm, located behind
Branner near Encina Hall, were asked
to leave the building at 11:15 p.m. and
were instructed to remain outside until
at least 1 a.m., one hour after the caller
said the bomb would explode.

Assistant Fire Chief John Barr, the
Fire Department's explosives expert,
reported just before midnight that a
search of the building revealed no
explosive devices.
Barr later reported that the wing of
Branner closest to Toyon was briefly
evacuated, but the occupants were
allowed to re-enter the building after
the area was searched.
During the nearly two-hour wait,
Toyon residents waited in and near the
eating clubs just east of the structure or
stood at considerable distance from the
structure on either side, conversing
with firemen and Stanford police
officers who had responded to the
threat.
