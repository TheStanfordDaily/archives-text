# Shoplifters Rip Off Campus Stores
## 
### CRAIG CORTORA 
Two teen-age boys confidently
walked into a sporting-goods store,
picked up a canoe and walked out. They
were caught when they returned for the
paddles.
Ridiculous, but true. Brazen
shoplifting, or "ripping off" as it is
popularly known, is plaguing campus
stores as well as commercial businesses.
The Bookstore loses about $42,000

a year to shoplifters, Ivan Sanderson,
manager, estimates. That figure
represents 1.5 percent of total sales.
The Tresidder Food Service and
Drugstore are also favorite targets of
the light-fingered. Both average
"industrial shrinkage" of 2 percent,
which includes losses due to
merchandising errors as well as rip-offs.
A determined shoplifter is hard to stop,
according to Miss Frances Silva, store
manager.

Sanderson agrees. Man> stores have
often found that combating shoplifting
with mirrors and TV cameras is not
significantly reducing their shoplifting
losses," he says, while hiring
floor-walkers is impractical.
What kinds of people shoplift?
A Harvard psychologist, Kenneth T.
Dinklage, feels that the predominant
type of college shoplifter is a student
who was completely successful in high
school whose world falls apart in
college.
But most student Robin Hoods seem
to defy classification.
"I save a lot of money doing it,"
says one admitted shoplifter, while
another argues that shoplifting is really
a perverse form of communism. "If
you're a communist, ripping off is
taking community property," he says.
"A large part of the incentive to rip
off is because it's so easy to do," says
yet another student. "In the Bookstore
you can always take paperbacks
downstairs and then go up to the
balcony and hide them where there are
really no people who have the time to
watch you."
"A lot of times, you don't even have
to conceal an item," an expert
comments. "If you walk around with
something, people think it's yours."
However, Sanderson thinks that
there are less problems here with
shoplifting than at other colleges.
"Most students at Stanford are pretty
ethical about this," he says.
