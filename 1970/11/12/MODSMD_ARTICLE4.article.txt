# Aid Latin American Children
## Doctors Fix Birth Defects 
### JEFF WORK 
A surgical team from the Stanford
University School of Medicine has
initiated a program that will help
eliminate the misery of grotesque
deformity in Central America.
The program began when a fourteen
year old Mexican boy was brought to
Stanford through the San Francisco
based Latin American Mission Project.
The boy was deformed with a cleft lip
and palate. He had grown up in his
community as a social outcast.
With the help of corrective surgery
at Stanford, the boy was transformed
into a constructive member of his
society.
Rare in U.S.
Investigation of this case showed
that cleft lip and palate are very
common in Latin America. In the
United States this deformity does not
appear to be as common because since

194 0, public health care improvements
have allowed for its correction in
infancy.
The fact that the problem is so
common in Latin America aroused the
interest of Stanford physicians, in
particular Dr. Donald R. Laub, head of
the Division of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery.
Dr. Laub led the first expedition
into Mexico in 1968. Each expedition
contains surgeons, anesthetists, nurses,
residents, students, and an
anaplastologist.
The program has a four pronged
attack:
—Two journeys a year are
made to select patients for the
program, and also to follow up
on previous cases.
—Twice a year an expedition
flies southward for a weekend
of surgery, each time treating
between eleven and seventeen
patients.
—A mutual learning
experience. The surgeons from
Stanford learn about repairing
the deformity and the local
doctors gain instruction on
new techniques of surgery and
anesthesia.
— Patients that need more
intensive care than is available
in their local area are brought
back to Stanford. Here the
patients live with persons who
volunteered to help with the
program, and receive

treatment at the Medical
Center.
Plans for long-term expansion of this
program, as quoted from Dr. Laub's
booklet entitled "Surgical
Reconstruction in Mexico and Central
America," include:
—research of cleft disease;
—improvement of training
practices, including more
exchanges of doctors between
Stanford and foreign hospitals;
—possible expansion of the
project to include the
American Indians in Arizona;
—expansion into more
developing countries;
—mounting six expeditions a
year, treating 2 00 patients
annually.
The only prohibitive part of the
program is its cost. Originally costs
were shared by the participating
doctors from Stanford, with very little
outside support.
Drugs and equipment for the
operations have largely been donated
by interested commercial companies.
But the major cost of the program has
been travel expenses.
The cost of the medical expeditions

for the next few years will be
approximately $18,000 annually, to
treat 200 patients. This figures to be
roughly $90 a patient.
Benefits from the program reach far
beyond the obvious "good-will"
generated in the countries being helped.
The patients have rid themselves of the
deformity that caused them to live the
life of an outcast, and the removal is at
no charge to the patient. In exchange
the doctors receive information on the
problem of cleft lip and palate. Also, as
Dr. Laub emphasizes, "the plastic
surgeon finds that he does not have to
work on merely a cosmetic basis. But
he can also take an active part in
changing a person's life."

made to select patients for the
program, and also to follow up
on previous cases.
—Twice a year an expedition
flies southward for a weekend
of surgery, each time treating
between eleven and seventeen
patients.
—A mutual learning
experience. The surgeons from
Stanford learn about repairing
the deformity and the local
doctors gain instruction on
new techniques of surgery and
anesthesia.
— Patients that need more
intensive care than is available
in their local area are brought
back to Stanford. Here the
patients live with persons who
volunteered to help with the
program, and receive

treatment at the Medical
Center.
Plans for long-term expansion of this
program, as quoted from Dr. Laub's
booklet entitled "Surgical
Reconstruction in Mexico and Central
America," include:
—research of cleft disease;
—improvement of training
practices, including more
exchanges of doctors between
Stanford and foreign hospitals;
—possible expansion of the
project to include the
American Indians in Arizona;
—expansion into more
developing countries;
—mounting six expeditions a
year, treating 2 00 patients
annually.
The only prohibitive part of the
program is its cost. Originally costs
were shared by the participating
doctors from Stanford, with very little
outside support.
Drugs and equipment for the
operations have largely been donated
by interested commercial companies.
But the major cost of the program has
been travel expenses.
The cost of the medical expeditions

for the next few years will be
approximately $18,000 annually, to
treat 200 patients. This figures to be
roughly $90 a patient.
Benefits from the program reach far
beyond the obvious "good-will"
generated in the countries being helped.
The patients have rid themselves of the
deformity that caused them to live the
life of an outcast, and the removal is at
no charge to the patient. In exchange
the doctors receive information on the
problem of cleft lip and palate. Also, as
Dr. Laub emphasizes, "the plastic
surgeon finds that he does not have to
work on merely a cosmetic basis. But
he can also take an active part in
changing a person's life."
A surgical team from the Stanford
University School of Medicine has
initiated a program that will help
eliminate the misery of grotesque
deformity in Central America.
The program began when a fourteen
year old Mexican boy was brought to
Stanford through the San Francisco
based Latin American Mission Project.
The boy was deformed with a cleft lip
and palate. He had grown up in his
community as a social outcast.
With the help of corrective surgery
at Stanford, the boy was transformed
into a constructive member of his
society.
Rare in U.S.
Investigation of this case showed
that cleft lip and palate are very
common in Latin America. In the
United States this deformity does not
appear to be as common because since

194 0, public health care improvements
have allowed for its correction in
infancy.
The fact that the problem is so
common in Latin America aroused the
interest of Stanford physicians, in
particular Dr. Donald R. Laub, head of
the Division of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgery.
Dr. Laub led the first expedition
into Mexico in 1968. Each expedition
contains surgeons, anesthetists, nurses,
residents, students, and an
anaplastologist.
The program has a four pronged
attack:
—Two journeys a year are
made to select patients for the
program, and also to follow up
on previous cases.
—Twice a year an expedition
flies southward for a weekend
of surgery, each time treating
between eleven and seventeen
patients.
