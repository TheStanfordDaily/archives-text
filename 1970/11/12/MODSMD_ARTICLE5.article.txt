# Smack Spreads Out From Ghetto
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF Second in a Series 
Heroin is the leading cause of death for people
under 21 in New York City. On Halloween some
worried parents made their children sift through their
trick or treat sacks and throw out any candy that
might be laced with the drug. Public officials, once
content to view smack as mainly a ghetto problem are
now suddenly "concerned" as addiction spills over
into white suburban communities.
Generalities about heroin are difficult to form.
Now many addicts are white, a fact which clashes
with the stereotype of the urban black or chicano
addict. Many have short hair since a straight
appearance allows them to forge checks or wander
through stores while shoplifting without arousing
suspicion.
Few people know very much about the local
population of heroin addicts. No one can even agree
on a rough estimate of its size. Police officials
estimate 150 to 2 00. A member of the Free
University puts the number anywhere between 100
and 1 000. A group of young film-makers who
recently debuted a film on Palo Alto addicts gauge
the population between 5 00 and 1000 and claim that
most live within a mile of the old City Hall at Newell
and Embarcadero.
Thus, collecting information becomes haphazard
at best. Heroin is new to the area. Three years ago,
police claim, there was only a fraction of the number
they list now, and officials base their claim on the rise
of "heroin-related" crimes such as assault, thefts over
$50 , auto theft, and burglary.
Hand in Hand
"The two go hand in hand," said officer Donald
Simerly in an interview wilh the Palo Alto Times.
A Palo Alto High student who pushes only
"organic" drugs estimates that out of 1500 students
in his school, "maybe 40 at the outside have used
smack." Only four he thought could be called regular
users.

"We've been through too much of the scientific
explanation to get into smack heavily," he said. "Kids
here are bright, rich, and white. We're hardly smack
recruiting ground."
Occasional Lectures
He and his friends avoid smack addicts and the
pushers. Occasionally he lectures the users, but "it
doesn't do much good."
The smack problem that he sees lies not in his
school or even in the tree-lined streets of central Palo
Alto. Instead he points to high schools such as
Cubberley and Ravenswood that lie on the edges of
lower class parts of Palo Alto.
. "Farther south, it gets worse. Mountain View and
San Jose, they're smack cities. They're poorer, full of
black and brown people."
Drug Problems
John Dolly writes frequent columns for the Free
You newspaper about drug problems. He aims his
writing at the dangers of drug abuse and warns
pushers to stop selling heroin, speed, and "reds," the
pills with which many dealers introduce clients to
heroin.
"For a long time smack was easy to get in the
ghetto. It was allowed to exist without much trouble.
Smack was OK." Dolly feels that police in big cities
take payoffs to ignore most of the heroin problem or
are otherwise incapable of handling narcotics. "The
only people against the pushers were the Black
Panthers. In New York the police find dead pushers
with needles in their arms or through their necks.
These deaths are generally attributed to the Panthers.
But the Mafia controls the situation and also a lot of
the people who are supposed to prevent heroin from
being distributed."
A kilo of heroin imported to New York costs the
buyer $1000, said Dolly. But by the time that it
filtered down to the addict on the street and was sold
in $5 "nickel bags," the same kilo was selling for $1
million.

Heroin use has spread, Dolly feels, and "now it's
into the suburbs. Suburban police are trying to catch
the dealers, but they can't. The Red Squad around
here is in charge of that, but instead they spend 90
percent of their time chasing radicals and
revolutionaries." The "Red Squad" is a special
intelligence unit of the Palo Alto police.
Police Concerned
"In general, the police are concerned and so is the
city government. It's their kids that are in trouble.
But even if they did something, how hard is it to go
up to San Francisco to get it?" said Dolly.
On campus the Health Center claims there are only
three recorded cases of heroin addiction, one of the
students chicano and the other two white from
upper-middle class backgrounds. Dr. David Dorosin
of the psychiatric staff at Cowell felt, "Stanford
students are not plagued by the low self-esteem, the
great sense of desperation that characterizes the speed
freak, the junkie, the people with severe sustained
drug problems." All three cases had carried over their
addiction from high school and found that campus
life made their heroin problem more difficult to live
with.
Two have left the University, and the third was
able to break his habit and continue with school.
Council Meeting
Discussion of heroin problems surfaced in a recent
Palo Alto city council meeting. Last Monday night
Robert Cullenbine, a past head of the Free
University, claimed that the police lacked the
necessary funds to crack down on drug dealing. The
Council members protested that the police was doing
all it could.
Councilman William Clark, a doctor, agreed with
Cullenbine that heroin was a problem and admitted
he had treated five youths between 16 and 2 0 for the
drug.
City Manager George Morgan said that the city
would not withhold funds from the police
department if they requested it.
