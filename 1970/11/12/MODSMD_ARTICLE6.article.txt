## Sexism Is Getting Worse 
### 
I became interested in
"sexism" when I met a woman
who had a masters degree, was a
typist, and earned a little over
$400 a month.
Was this an isolated incident? I
began to look around for facts
and found that things are really
bad for women workers. And that
they're getting worse.
The wage gap between
full-time working women and men
has widened over the last decade.
According to the Dept. of Labor,
in 1 955 the median wage of a
full-time woman worker was 63
percent of a man's. By 1968 it
had dropped to 58 percent. Her
mean pay was only 45 percent of
a man's that year. People have
argued that the differences in
wages are because men do the
heavier, more dangerous work.
But, if you look within all job
categories for '69 you will find
that a woman earned x h of what
men did in the SAME categories.
These categories include
professional, clerical, service,
technical, etc. The only deviation
was in sales where a woman
worker earned less than % of what
her male counterpart did, as she
took home an average of $3461
and he a pay of $8549.
Some have argued that men
earn more because they have more
edication. Well, let's look. A
woman with a college degree can
expect to earn a few dollars more
than a male with an eighth grade
education, according to U.S. News
and World Report. The day she
graduates from college, if she
works full-time, she can expect to
earn x h of what her male classmate
earns.
Black Problem
Others have argued that the
wage problem of black males is a
far worse problem, so let's look at
that. In 1968, for full-time work,
a black woman brought home V2
of what the black man did. White
women brought home 2 /3 of what
the black man did.
Women are doing no better at
the universities. The percentages
of women at all levels in
universities has declined since the
1920'5. In the twenties women
made up 30 percent of college
level faculties, now they comprise
18 percent.
Some have argued that women
tend to get degrees in
"impractical" subjects such as
English and biology, yet the
faculties of these "impractical"
departments are almost totally
male. Somehow the few men in
these fields seem able to get the
university appointments.
Ph.D.'s
In fields such as sociology 30
percent of the Ph.D.'s go to
women, but only 1 percent of the
full-professors in sociology are
women, despite the fact that
women Ph.D.'s tend to publish
more and perform better
academically than their male
colleagues, according to an article
in the Sept. 25 issue of Science.
How does Stanford fit into the
picture? The situation is best
illustrated by an ad we chuckled
over (but which really wasn't
funny), for a position; college
degree, 2 languages, typing
required, the pay was a little over
$450/ mo. It should be noted that
gardeners and groundsmen start
out at $525 and $570/ mo., which
is more than the average woman

worker can ever expect to earn at
Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!
Salary Ranges
The salary ranges for
professional positions last year
typically ranged from $600 to
$ 1 500 a month. Clerical salaries
ranged from $400 to $600. Thus,

men with college degrees (some of
which are irrelevant to their work)
are overwhelmingly placed in
professional, managerial and
official positions, whereas women
with the same background tend to
be automatically placed in clerical
positions which pay 1/3 to 1/2 as
much, and which tend to be the
more routine, dull, petty, tedious,
non-decision making tasks
including making coffee.
Let's look at the faculty
woman worker at Stanford. These
were the figures for 1968-69.

MEN WOMEN
full professor 490 8
assoc. professor 215 10
asst. professor 289 31
instructor 98 43
lecturer 89 30
Whereas nationally women
make up 18 percent of all college
level faculties, at Stanford they
are less than 5 percent of the
professors. Although 17 percent

of Stanford's graduate students
are women, less than 2 percent of
its full professors are women.
Marriage
Some argue that the low status
of women in universities result
from her being more tied to a
locality when she's married. Yet,
according to a Stanford report,
"the hypothesis that a woman's
marital status accounts for her
rank at Stanford is not
substantiated by the data."

What can be done about this
situation?
Myths
First some of the myths which
are usually given to justify the
keeping of women at the bottom
of the scale in status and pay,
both in business and in academia.
1) "Women are supplemental
workers—they don't really have to
work."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Most women
work because they have to work.
6,000,000 women are heads of
families and 2/3 of the families
headed by women are below
poverty level. In this supposedly
benevolently "paternalistic"
society over 60 percent of the
nations "poor" are women.
Poverty is correlated with being
female.
2) "Most women drop their
academic careers for other
things—that's why they never
make it."
Not true, according to the
September '70 issue of Science.
"91 percent of women who
receive doctorates in 1 957-58
were employed in 1964 , and 79
percent of them had not
interrupted their careers during
that time."
3) "Non-academic women
leave their jobs more often than
men—that's why they're paid so
little."
True in part. According to the
Dept. of Labor this lack of job
stability is not correlated with
being a woman but with low
paying, low status jobs. Men who
are paid equally poorly are
equally "mobile."
4) "Women are always sick, or
staying home with the kids."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Absenteeism is
about the same for men and
women.
The root causes of sexism are
imbedded in our social and
economic system which is often
based on exploitation of cheap
labor supplies, profiteering, and
self-interest. To solve these
problems we will have to change
the system.
In the meanwhile, we can do
something for the women workers
at Stanford.

Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!
Salary Ranges
The salary ranges for
professional positions last year
typically ranged from $600 to
$ 1 500 a month. Clerical salaries
ranged from $400 to $600. Thus,

men with college degrees (some of
which are irrelevant to their work)
are overwhelmingly placed in
professional, managerial and
official positions, whereas women
with the same background tend to
be automatically placed in clerical
positions which pay 1/3 to 1/2 as
much, and which tend to be the
more routine, dull, petty, tedious,
non-decision making tasks
including making coffee.
Let's look at the faculty
woman worker at Stanford. These
were the figures for 1968-69.

MEN WOMEN
full professor 490 8
assoc. professor 215 10
asst. professor 289 31
instructor 98 43
lecturer 89 30
Whereas nationally women
make up 18 percent of all college
level faculties, at Stanford they
are less than 5 percent of the
professors. Although 17 percent

of Stanford's graduate students
are women, less than 2 percent of
its full professors are women.
Marriage
Some argue that the low status
of women in universities result
from her being more tied to a
locality when she's married. Yet,
according to a Stanford report,
"the hypothesis that a woman's
marital status accounts for her
rank at Stanford is not
substantiated by the data."

What can be done about this
situation?
Myths
First some of the myths which
are usually given to justify the
keeping of women at the bottom
of the scale in status and pay,
both in business and in academia.
1) "Women are supplemental
workers—they don't really have to
work."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Most women
work because they have to work.
6,000,000 women are heads of
families and 2/3 of the families
headed by women are below
poverty level. In this supposedly
benevolently "paternalistic"
society over 60 percent of the
nations "poor" are women.
Poverty is correlated with being
female.
2) "Most women drop their
academic careers for other
things—that's why they never
make it."
Not true, according to the
September '70 issue of Science.
"91 percent of women who
receive doctorates in 1 957-58
were employed in 1964 , and 79
percent of them had not
interrupted their careers during
that time."
3) "Non-academic women
leave their jobs more often than
men—that's why they're paid so
little."
True in part. According to the
Dept. of Labor this lack of job
stability is not correlated with
being a woman but with low
paying, low status jobs. Men who
are paid equally poorly are
equally "mobile."
4) "Women are always sick, or
staying home with the kids."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Absenteeism is
about the same for men and
women.
The root causes of sexism are
imbedded in our social and
economic system which is often
based on exploitation of cheap
labor supplies, profiteering, and
self-interest. To solve these
problems we will have to change
the system.
In the meanwhile, we can do
something for the women workers
at Stanford.

I became interested in
"sexism" when I met a woman
who had a masters degree, was a
typist, and earned a little over
$400 a month.
Was this an isolated incident? I
began to look around for facts
and found that things are really
bad for women workers. And that
they're getting worse.
The wage gap between
full-time working women and men
has widened over the last decade.
According to the Dept. of Labor,
in 1 955 the median wage of a
full-time woman worker was 63
percent of a man's. By 1968 it
had dropped to 58 percent. Her
mean pay was only 45 percent of
a man's that year. People have
argued that the differences in
wages are because men do the
heavier, more dangerous work.
But, if you look within all job
categories for '69 you will find
that a woman earned x h of what
men did in the SAME categories.
These categories include
professional, clerical, service,
technical, etc. The only deviation
was in sales where a woman
worker earned less than % of what
her male counterpart did, as she
took home an average of $3461
and he a pay of $8549.
Some have argued that men
earn more because they have more
edication. Well, let's look. A
woman with a college degree can
expect to earn a few dollars more
than a male with an eighth grade
education, according to U.S. News
and World Report. The day she
graduates from college, if she
works full-time, she can expect to
earn x h of what her male classmate
earns.
Black Problem
Others have argued that the
wage problem of black males is a
far worse problem, so let's look at
that. In 1968, for full-time work,
a black woman brought home V2
of what the black man did. White
women brought home 2 /3 of what
the black man did.
Women are doing no better at
the universities. The percentages
of women at all levels in
universities has declined since the
1920'5. In the twenties women
made up 30 percent of college
level faculties, now they comprise
18 percent.
Some have argued that women
tend to get degrees in
"impractical" subjects such as
English and biology, yet the
faculties of these "impractical"
departments are almost totally
male. Somehow the few men in
these fields seem able to get the
university appointments.
Ph.D.'s
In fields such as sociology 30
percent of the Ph.D.'s go to
women, but only 1 percent of the
full-professors in sociology are
women, despite the fact that
women Ph.D.'s tend to publish
more and perform better
academically than their male
colleagues, according to an article
in the Sept. 25 issue of Science.
How does Stanford fit into the
picture? The situation is best
illustrated by an ad we chuckled
over (but which really wasn't
funny), for a position; college
degree, 2 languages, typing
required, the pay was a little over
$450/ mo. It should be noted that
gardeners and groundsmen start
out at $525 and $570/ mo., which
is more than the average woman

worker can ever expect to earn at
Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!

based on exploitation of cheap
labor supplies, profiteering, and
self-interest. To solve these
problems we will have to change
the system.
In the meanwhile, we can do
something for the women workers
at Stanford.

I became interested in
"sexism" when I met a woman
who had a masters degree, was a
typist, and earned a little over
$400 a month.
Was this an isolated incident? I
began to look around for facts
and found that things are really
bad for women workers. And that
they're getting worse.
The wage gap between
full-time working women and men
has widened over the last decade.
According to the Dept. of Labor,
in 1 955 the median wage of a
full-time woman worker was 63
percent of a man's. By 1968 it
had dropped to 58 percent. Her
mean pay was only 45 percent of
a man's that year. People have
argued that the differences in
wages are because men do the
heavier, more dangerous work.
But, if you look within all job
categories for '69 you will find
that a woman earned x h of what
men did in the SAME categories.
These categories include
professional, clerical, service,
technical, etc. The only deviation
was in sales where a woman
worker earned less than % of what
her male counterpart did, as she
took home an average of $3461
and he a pay of $8549.
Some have argued that men
earn more because they have more
edication. Well, let's look. A
woman with a college degree can
expect to earn a few dollars more
than a male with an eighth grade
education, according to U.S. News
and World Report. The day she
graduates from college, if she
works full-time, she can expect to
earn x h of what her male classmate
earns.
Black Problem
Others have argued that the
wage problem of black males is a
far worse problem, so let's look at
that. In 1968, for full-time work,
a black woman brought home V2
of what the black man did. White
women brought home 2 /3 of what
the black man did.
Women are doing no better at
the universities. The percentages
of women at all levels in
universities has declined since the
1920'5. In the twenties women
made up 30 percent of college
level faculties, now they comprise
18 percent.
Some have argued that women
tend to get degrees in
"impractical" subjects such as
English and biology, yet the
faculties of these "impractical"
departments are almost totally
male. Somehow the few men in
these fields seem able to get the
university appointments.
Ph.D.'s
In fields such as sociology 30
percent of the Ph.D.'s go to
women, but only 1 percent of the
full-professors in sociology are
women, despite the fact that
women Ph.D.'s tend to publish
more and perform better
academically than their male
colleagues, according to an article
in the Sept. 25 issue of Science.
How does Stanford fit into the
picture? The situation is best
illustrated by an ad we chuckled
over (but which really wasn't
funny), for a position; college
degree, 2 languages, typing
required, the pay was a little over
$450/ mo. It should be noted that
gardeners and groundsmen start
out at $525 and $570/ mo., which
is more than the average woman

worker can ever expect to earn at
Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!
Salary Ranges
The salary ranges for
professional positions last year
typically ranged from $600 to
$ 1 500 a month. Clerical salaries
ranged from $400 to $600. Thus,

men with college degrees (some of
which are irrelevant to their work)
are overwhelmingly placed in
professional, managerial and
official positions, whereas women
with the same background tend to
be automatically placed in clerical
positions which pay 1/3 to 1/2 as
much, and which tend to be the
more routine, dull, petty, tedious,
non-decision making tasks
including making coffee.
Let's look at the faculty
woman worker at Stanford. These
were the figures for 1968-69.

MEN WOMEN
full professor 490 8
assoc. professor 215 10
asst. professor 289 31
instructor 98 43
lecturer 89 30
Whereas nationally women
make up 18 percent of all college
level faculties, at Stanford they
are less than 5 percent of the
professors. Although 17 percent

of Stanford's graduate students
are women, less than 2 percent of
its full professors are women.
Marriage
Some argue that the low status
of women in universities result
from her being more tied to a
locality when she's married. Yet,
according to a Stanford report,
"the hypothesis that a woman's
marital status accounts for her
rank at Stanford is not
substantiated by the data."

What can be done about this
situation?
Myths
First some of the myths which
are usually given to justify the
keeping of women at the bottom
of the scale in status and pay,
both in business and in academia.
1) "Women are supplemental
workers—they don't really have to
work."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Most women
work because they have to work.
6,000,000 women are heads of
families and 2/3 of the families
headed by women are below
poverty level. In this supposedly
benevolently "paternalistic"
society over 60 percent of the
nations "poor" are women.
Poverty is correlated with being
female.
2) "Most women drop their
academic careers for other
things—that's why they never
make it."
Not true, according to the
September '70 issue of Science.
"91 percent of women who
receive doctorates in 1 957-58
were employed in 1964 , and 79
percent of them had not
interrupted their careers during
that time."
3) "Non-academic women
leave their jobs more often than
men—that's why they're paid so
little."
True in part. According to the
Dept. of Labor this lack of job
stability is not correlated with
being a woman but with low
paying, low status jobs. Men who
are paid equally poorly are
equally "mobile."
4) "Women are always sick, or
staying home with the kids."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Absenteeism is
about the same for men and
women.
The root causes of sexism are
imbedded in our social and
economic system which is often
based on exploitation of cheap
labor supplies, profiteering, and
self-interest. To solve these
problems we will have to change
the system.

$450/ mo. It should be noted that
gardeners and groundsmen start
out at $525 and $570/ mo., which
is more than the average woman

worker can ever expect to earn at
Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!
Salary Ranges
The salary ranges for
professional positions last year
typically ranged from $600 to
$ 1 500 a month. Clerical salaries
ranged from $400 to $600. Thus,

men with college degrees (some of
which are irrelevant to their work)
are overwhelmingly placed in
professional, managerial and
official positions, whereas women
with the same background tend to
be automatically placed in clerical
positions which pay 1/3 to 1/2 as
much, and which tend to be the
more routine, dull, petty, tedious,
non-decision making tasks
including making coffee.
Let's look at the faculty
woman worker at Stanford. These
were the figures for 1968-69.

MEN WOMEN
full professor 490 8
assoc. professor 215 10
asst. professor 289 31
instructor 98 43
lecturer 89 30
Whereas nationally women
make up 18 percent of all college
level faculties, at Stanford they
are less than 5 percent of the
professors. Although 17 percent

of Stanford's graduate students
are women, less than 2 percent of
its full professors are women.
Marriage
Some argue that the low status
of women in universities result
from her being more tied to a
locality when she's married. Yet,
according to a Stanford report,
"the hypothesis that a woman's
marital status accounts for her
rank at Stanford is not
substantiated by the data."

What can be done about this
situation?
Myths
First some of the myths which
are usually given to justify the
keeping of women at the bottom
of the scale in status and pay,
both in business and in academia.
1) "Women are supplemental
workers—they don't really have to
work."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Most women
work because they have to work.
6,000,000 women are heads of
families and 2/3 of the families
headed by women are below
poverty level. In this supposedly
benevolently "paternalistic"
society over 60 percent of the
nations "poor" are women.
Poverty is correlated with being
female.
2) "Most women drop their
academic careers for other
things—that's why they never
make it."
Not true, according to the
September '70 issue of Science.
"91 percent of women who
receive doctorates in 1 957-58
were employed in 1964 , and 79
percent of them had not
interrupted their careers during
that time."
3) "Non-academic women
leave their jobs more often than
men—that's why they're paid so
little."
True in part. According to the
Dept. of Labor this lack of job
stability is not correlated with
being a woman but with low
paying, low status jobs. Men who
are paid equally poorly are
equally "mobile."
4) "Women are always sick, or
staying home with the kids."
Not true, according to the
Dept. of Labor. Absenteeism is
about the same for men and
women.
The root causes of sexism are
imbedded in our social and
economic system which is often
based on exploitation of cheap
labor supplies, profiteering, and
self-interest. To solve these
problems we will have to change
the system.
In the meanwhile, we can do
something for the women workers
at Stanford.

I became interested in
"sexism" when I met a woman
who had a masters degree, was a
typist, and earned a little over
$400 a month.
Was this an isolated incident? I
began to look around for facts
and found that things are really
bad for women workers. And that
they're getting worse.
The wage gap between
full-time working women and men
has widened over the last decade.
According to the Dept. of Labor,
in 1 955 the median wage of a
full-time woman worker was 63
percent of a man's. By 1968 it
had dropped to 58 percent. Her
mean pay was only 45 percent of
a man's that year. People have
argued that the differences in
wages are because men do the
heavier, more dangerous work.
But, if you look within all job
categories for '69 you will find
that a woman earned x h of what
men did in the SAME categories.
These categories include
professional, clerical, service,
technical, etc. The only deviation
was in sales where a woman
worker earned less than % of what
her male counterpart did, as she
took home an average of $3461
and he a pay of $8549.
Some have argued that men
earn more because they have more
edication. Well, let's look. A
woman with a college degree can
expect to earn a few dollars more
than a male with an eighth grade
education, according to U.S. News
and World Report. The day she
graduates from college, if she
works full-time, she can expect to
earn x h of what her male classmate
earns.
Black Problem
Others have argued that the
wage problem of black males is a
far worse problem, so let's look at
that. In 1968, for full-time work,
a black woman brought home V2
of what the black man did. White
women brought home 2 /3 of what
the black man did.
Women are doing no better at
the universities. The percentages
of women at all levels in
universities has declined since the
1920'5. In the twenties women
made up 30 percent of college
level faculties, now they comprise
18 percent.
Some have argued that women
tend to get degrees in
"impractical" subjects such as
English and biology, yet the
faculties of these "impractical"
departments are almost totally
male. Somehow the few men in
these fields seem able to get the
university appointments.
Ph.D.'s
In fields such as sociology 30
percent of the Ph.D.'s go to
women, but only 1 percent of the
full-professors in sociology are
women, despite the fact that
women Ph.D.'s tend to publish
more and perform better
academically than their male
colleagues, according to an article
in the Sept. 25 issue of Science.
How does Stanford fit into the
picture? The situation is best
illustrated by an ad we chuckled
over (but which really wasn't
funny), for a position; college
degree, 2 languages, typing
required, the pay was a little over
$450/ mo. It should be noted that
gardeners and groundsmen start
out at $525 and $570/ mo., which
is more than the average woman

worker can ever expect to earn at
Stanford, whether she's doing
hard service work or whether she
has a college degree!
