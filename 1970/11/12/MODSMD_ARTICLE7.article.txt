# University Answer To Workers' Open Letter
## 
### 
I have been asked to reply to
the unsigned letter of November 6
in which your organization, along
with some of the other
organizations representing
Stanford employees and currently
involved in the NLRB
proceedings, is apparently asking
the University administration to
grant excused time to employees
to attend a meeting on Friday,
November 13, to discuss union
affairs and related issues.
As you know, unofficial and
voluntary employee groups at
Stanford, whether they be unions
or other organizations established
for economic, social, political or
other purposes, have always been
expected to conduct their

activities outside of regular
working hours.
Concerning union activities
specifically, the University has
clearly and repeatedly stated that
organizing and informational
activities are not to interfere with
regular University operations and
functions, and that policy is
applicable in this instance. On the
other hand, we have not
attempted in any way to interfere
with union activities during
non-working times or in
non-working areas. We cannot,
therefore, honor the request for
time off for such a meeting.
The analogy to the recent
election recess for students and
faculty is not apposite. Students
are not paid employees and their
"schedule" therefore is a matter
of very different concern from
that of such employees.
As for faculty, their schedule
too is different from that of
regular staff. Faculty do not work
assigned hours nor do they in all
but a most general sense have to

meet assigned tasks. In addition,
as you will recall, the
arrangements for the election
recess contemplated additional
work by both faculty and
students to make up for time lost.
The University has sought to
keep employees informed of the
NLRB hearings through the Staff
News, notices to staff, etc., and
will continue in that effort. But
more importantly, representatives
from the campus employee
organizations have been present at
the hearings, and I have assumed
all along that they have been
representing the wishes of their
constituencies.
If this is the case—and I
certainly hope that it is—then our
present way of proceeding must
be adequate. If it is not the case,
then it is up to the constituencies
of each group to ensure that its
representatives are informed of its
wishes.
