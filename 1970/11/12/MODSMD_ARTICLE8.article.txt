## Freedom Suite: Part III 
### 
It's not often that one article
earns the simultaneous enmity of
revolutionary and reactionary
alike. And it isn't that I don't feel
honored by this unsolicited
distinction which was showered
on me in Tuesday's Daily.
But I do regret that neither Mr.
Evers nor Mr. Hocker was able to
get far enough out of his own
well-tracked skull to give a
genuinely responsive reply to last
week's column entitled "Freedom
and Unfreedom." In a way, they
are living proof of the
pervasiveness of the freedom ideal
in America; on reading the title,
both seem to have developed a
glazed-gaze and noticeable drool

which impaired their
comprehension of what followed.
According to anarchist Evers, I
am a "self-professed opponent of
human liberation," and close
enough to "clerical fascism to give
one pause for thought." And
listening to Mr. Mocker, a trooper
in Harvey Hukari's little brigade,
my views are those of "the classic
collectivist (and present-day
liberal)." — an interesting
non-sequitur, typical of the para
noid Right.
Restrictive Society?
In fact, the thrust of my article
had nothing to do with fascism or
collectivism. It did not endorse
either the general concept of a
restrictive society, nor any of the
specific boogie-man restrictions
which have so animated Mssrs.
Evers and Mocker, ("systematic
oppression of the U.S.
government," and "collectivism"
which has been the "tendency" of
American history.)
To the contrary, I expressed
opposition to arbitrary limits on
freedom, and recognized that
some groups in particular are
treated unfairly. I expressed no
support, and have no sympathy
whatever for any force which
lords itself over all, or tries to
keep a particular group down.
Evers and Hocker, not
withstanding, the thrust of my
article was somewhere else
altogether. Far from supporting
domination by anyone, I was
criticizing the liberation approach
to the problem of human freedom
as an outlook which promises the
final solution in the morning, but
is utterly bankrupt in terms of
producing happiness. My goal was
to condemn the naivete of Evers
and Hocker, among too many
others.

For both present their
libertarianism as the key to
human satisfaction. To both,
liberty is the necessary and
sufficient prerequisite of
successful human life. Hocker's
analogy between disliking
authority and disliking being hit
by a truck, is cute in this regard;
but it is sadly revealing as to the
shallowness of his epistemology.
And neither deals seriously
with the argument that the lack of
a purpose broader than liberation
is the real cause of discontent.
Only Evers makes gestures in this
direction, and his effort amounts
to a denial, unsupported by
evidence.
Human Freedom
"To say that human freedom
is a primary goal is not to say that
other objectives. . .are
unimportant." People will not
lack direction under a system of
perfect liberty, but "will pursue
their happiness (and other goals.)"
A truly splendid, concrete
enunciation of purpose. . .

Hocker remains completely
mute on this point. And yet his
echo of Bob Dylan may be more
related to long range purpose than
he realizes. Yes, Chris, there
probably is "a way out of here."
But you've got to have some
conception of where you're at
before you can find the door out
of your frustration. And your
image of America as stifled by
collectivism isn't even close to the
truth.
So long as people like Hocker
and Evers devote all their mental
energies to thumping in
frustration on the walls that
surround them, they will have no
time to look for a key to unlock
the door which leads to a more
worthwhile existence. It's long
overtime (hat some Americans
start looking for meaning in
something other than wide open
spaces.

energies to thumping in
frustration on the walls that

It's not often that one article
earns the simultaneous enmity of
revolutionary and reactionary
alike. And it isn't that I don't feel
honored by this unsolicited
distinction which was showered
on me in Tuesday's Daily.
But I do regret that neither Mr.
Evers nor Mr. Hocker was able to
get far enough out of his own
well-tracked skull to give a
genuinely responsive reply to last
week's column entitled "Freedom
and Unfreedom." In a way, they
are living proof of the
pervasiveness of the freedom ideal
in America; on reading the title,
both seem to have developed a
glazed-gaze and noticeable drool

which impaired their
comprehension of what followed.
According to anarchist Evers, I
am a "self-professed opponent of
human liberation," and close
enough to "clerical fascism to give
one pause for thought." And
listening to Mr. Mocker, a trooper
in Harvey Hukari's little brigade,
my views are those of "the classic
collectivist (and present-day
liberal)." — an interesting
non-sequitur, typical of the para
noid Right.
Restrictive Society?
In fact, the thrust of my article
had nothing to do with fascism or
collectivism. It did not endorse
either the general concept of a
restrictive society, nor any of the
specific boogie-man restrictions
which have so animated Mssrs.
Evers and Mocker, ("systematic
oppression of the U.S.
government," and "collectivism"
which has been the "tendency" of
American history.)
To the contrary, I expressed
opposition to arbitrary limits on
freedom, and recognized that
some groups in particular are
treated unfairly. I expressed no
support, and have no sympathy
whatever for any force which
lords itself over all, or tries to
keep a particular group down.
Evers and Hocker, not
withstanding, the thrust of my
article was somewhere else
altogether. Far from supporting
domination by anyone, I was
criticizing the liberation approach
to the problem of human freedom
as an outlook which promises the
final solution in the morning, but
is utterly bankrupt in terms of
producing happiness. My goal was
to condemn the naivete of Evers
and Hocker, among too many
others.

For both present their
libertarianism as the key to
human satisfaction. To both,
liberty is the necessary and
sufficient prerequisite of
successful human life. Hocker's
analogy between disliking
authority and disliking being hit
by a truck, is cute in this regard;
but it is sadly revealing as to the
shallowness of his epistemology.
And neither deals seriously
with the argument that the lack of
a purpose broader than liberation
is the real cause of discontent.
Only Evers makes gestures in this
direction, and his effort amounts
to a denial, unsupported by
evidence.
Human Freedom
"To say that human freedom
is a primary goal is not to say that
other objectives. . .are
unimportant." People will not
lack direction under a system of
perfect liberty, but "will pursue
their happiness (and other goals.)"
