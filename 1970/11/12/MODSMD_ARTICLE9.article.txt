## Freedom And History 
### 
The essays on freedom by
libertarian spokesmen Bill Evers
and Chris Hocker betray the
traidtional misunderstanding of a
concept that has led this country
to bind itself in chains while
proclaiming itself to be free.
Freedom is not derived merely
by allowing voluntary associations
of men to develop spontaneously
without constraints. History has
disproved such Utopian ideas time
and time again. Freedom, if it is
defined as Evers and Hocker
suggest, becomes a meaningless
concept. When one realizes that
precisely this ideal was one upon
which this country was founded,
one must ask what has lead to the
betrayal of this seemingly worthy
concept. Surely not the
"collectivist mentality" as Hocker
suggests.
Any student of the history of
this country knows that the
reason government constraints
were instituted in the first place
(beginning with the anti-trust acts
of the early 1900's) was to
prevent "freedom" as private
property from destroying itself.
Because small-scale industry in the
course of its development
inevitably became monopoly
capitalism, the contradiction
between the concept of freedom
as laissez-faire and the reality of
monopolies, poverty and
exploitation became clear. This
lesson of history Evers and
Hocker have not learned. Perhaps
because they live in a world of the
ideal and not the real.
Freedom is a meaningful
concept but only if it is grounded
in concrete reality. Freedom is the
recognition of necessity. They
may resolve itself in one historical
period as laissez-faire capitalism
when industry in undeveloped and
in another as socialism. When the
means of production have become
so advanced and developed that
economic freedom turns into its
opposite—oppression of the many
and freedom for the few, then it
becomes "necessary" to advance
to a higher stage—with the
concept of freedom historically
re-defined. Under socialism, one is
freely guaranteed the material
necessities of life. Under any "free
association" of men, one is not.
This may be a small thing to Evers
and Hocker but it isn't to most of
the people in the world.
Such a system is surely
preferable to what Hocker and
Evers seem to suggest—turning our
backs on the advances of
technology and industrialization
and begin over again. Both are

afraid of something called
centralism. The concept has a
foreboding ring these days and it
should, because under capitalism
it is manifested as the rich few
controlling the destiny of
everyone else. To use this concept
of centralism as an abstraction
however with which to blur the
human and beneficial
potentialities of a centralized
economy is the tendency of
ligertarians.
Because their ideas are
ahistorical they are unable to
analyze and separate the good and
bad aspects of today's society.
They yearn for the old days when
a man was a man with only his

horse and his gun at his side. But
the old days are gone and a new
day is here. The only ideas that
make sense now are those that
realize and advocate the necessity
for change. The kind of change
that brings men together in
cooperation for their common
good. When men realize, as they
are the world over, that only by
cooperating and by re-defining
their individuality can they really
by "free," then they also realize
that the spectre of Hocker's
"collectivist" demon is bullshit
and perhaps man can be human
after all.
