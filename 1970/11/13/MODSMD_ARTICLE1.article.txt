# Stanford Research Institute: Yesterday And Today
## 
### FRED MANN First in a Series 
"It seems clear that the Peruvian and
Vietnamese peasants are not going to be able to
control their own lives, that the SKI intellectual
workers are not going to be able to do
constructive work, until Stanford students and
other Mid-Peninsula residents go over to the
Stanford Research Institute and talk to the
technicians about their work. And if talking
doesn't get SRI out of Southeast Asia and Latin
America, we may have to cast our wrenches into
the SRI machine."
Twenty five months ago, a Stanford radical
named David Pugh thus called for action against
the school's wholely-owned subsidiary research
foundation. His call was answered.
Talking did not achieve the stated goals, so
the wrenches were cast in demonstrations at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory, Encina Hall,
and SRI itself. And today, SRI is still in
Southeast Asia and Latin America.
With its main office located in Menlo Park
and branch offices in 13 other cities, ranging
from Bangkok, Thailand to Huntsville, Alabama,
SRI is now an independent research firm,
accepting projects from numerous clients at
home and abroad.
The company calls itself, "An independent,
non-profit organization performing
problem-solving research under contract with
business, industry, and government." Avid
supporters of SRI, of which there are many, go
further calling it a vital scientific link in the
growth of American industry and a valuable
contributor to the country's strength and
security.
Critics of SRI, of which there are also many,
have called it a den of intellectual whores and
the West Coast bulwark of the
military-industrial-university complex.
Created by Stanford
Up until January 13 of this year, SRI was

intimately connected with the University.
Founded under its auspices in 1 946, SRI was
intended to advance the educational purposes of
Stanford and provide specialized research
services to business, industry, foundations, and
the government.
The Stanford trustees were the general
members of the corporation controlling SRI,
and they elected its board of directors and its
chairman. At one time, nine trustees held seats
on the SRI board of directors, and others were
directors at SRI Associate corporations. Retiring
chairman of the board, Ernest C. Arbuckle is the
only man currently holding positions on both
bodies.
Five years ago however, the relationship
between Stanford and its researching offspring
began to go sour. The University realized a lack
of return, both educationally and financially
from SRI. Although some 5 0 faculty members
were consultants to SRI and 20 SRI researchers
were teaching at Stanford, the large, invaluable
interchange that was hoped for between the two
simply did not exist.
Discussions were held about the future of
SRI and its relationship to the University. But
the issue slipped away and no decision was
reached.
Martin Luther Style
However the connection between the two
institutes was soon brought to the public's
attention again. The "question of SRI"
dramatically became the "issue of SRI" when,
on October 8, 1968, the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) nailed a list of
demands on the office door of the Stanford
board of trustees.
The list included demands that all SRI
contracts, classified and unclassified, be made
public, as well as the values of the contracts and
the names of the individuals performing the
work on them. Furthermore, all Trustees, SRI
Directors and Stanford faculty were told to

make public all their corporate and government
connections.
Acting University president Robert Glaser
responded by calling for the creation of a
student-faculty committee to study the ties
between Stanford and SRI. He stated the study
"should be directed at not only the corporate
relationship with the University, but also at any
indirected relationship the University has with
SRI," and he appointed Law School Professor
Kenneth Scott as chairman.
Charges and Responses
While the committee undertook its work,
student radicals and SRI officers traded charges
and ans*wers about the type of research being
done at the institute. SDS claimed SRI had 55
men working on counterinsurgency projects, and
others producing new studies of defoliation,
bomb run cost analysis, and chemical and
biological warfare for the Department of
Defense.
SRI officials countered saying that less than
10 percent of their DOD contracts were
concerned with Vietnam, that only one man
studied chemical warfare, and that the only
study of biological agents was done in the areas
of cures for disease.
SRI went on to discredit the SDS demands as
invalid because "we are not, as they (SDS)
claim, a monolithic institution." Executive
vice-president Weldon B. Gibson added that SRI
was "extremely happy" with its connection with
the University.
Short Lived Happiness
The connection was not to last much longer
however, as the spring quarter saw sit-ins,
confrontations, and the bringing of police on
campus to oust demonstrators from Encina Hall.
The Stanford Research Institute and the
University's role in war and defense study had
become the most volitile issue in the University
history to that point.

In May of that year, in the midst of the SRI
protests, the Trustees followed a minority
opinion (favored by then Provost Richard
Lyman) of the student-faculty committee and
announced that SRI would be sold at a profit to
the University, and all affiliations would be
severed. (The majority report called for
separation with control by Stanford.) It was not
the answer most demonstrators were looking
for. Many felt that the severence of SRI would
not redirect the thrust of its work toward more
socially useful projects.
Any moderating influence the Stanford
community might have on the type of contracts
its research institute would accept would be
gone if it were sold.
But SRI officials claimed the bulk of their
work was already what protestors might term
"socially useful," and the organization went on
to purchase its own freedom.
Money to Stanford
SRI, by terms of the agreement with the
Stanford Trustees, is to pay the University in
excess of $25 million over a period of years, and
must relinquish the name "Stanford Research
Institute" within five years. The Trustees have
given up control of SRI, and the SRI Board of
Directors have become, in fact, the acting
general members of the corporation.
Rudolph K. Brunsvold, vice-president of SRI,
Is cautious about stating that the demonstrations
of 1969 actually caused the separation of the
corporation from Stanford. "Cause is too strong
a word," he said. The demonstrations "may have
accelerated it."
Committee chairman Professor Scott agreed
saying, "The actions against SRI certainly were
prominent factors in the split, and definitely
precipitated it, but there was dissatisfaction with
the set up long before that. The University
simply was not benefiting from it (SRI) the way
it was hoped it would."

protestors marching on the Menlo Park facility.
It is too early to judge the impact of the split
between Stanford and SRI, but at present, it
appears to have been a one-sided victory.
Radicals still express dissatisfaction with the
institution and its research, while for SRI,
autonomy has caused new efficiency and
productivity. Business has never been better.

that two years have brought.)
