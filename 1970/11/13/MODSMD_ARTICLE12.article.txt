# Indifferent Mitchum Discusses Latest Film
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
Robert Mitchum was in San
Francisco last week to talk about
his most recent film, "RYAN'S
DAUGHTER" which had its
premier November 9 in New
York.
Actors and directors are
usually sent around the country
to promote their latest efforts and
find themselves subjected to the
same stupid questions at least a
hundred times before their tour of
duty is up. Mitchum sees these
sessions as part of his obligation

and approaches them with the
same lack of fervor that he
approaches his role as an actor.
San Francisco was his last stop
before he went home to "check
on the laundry."
The actor was confronted by
half a dozen college students in
his room at the Fairmont and
naturally the conversation began
with the subject of politics.
Mitchum rambled on for half an
hour about African tribal politics
trying to make the point that

revolution is a never ending
process. So much for politics.
Mitchum explained that he
began his career as a writer for
radio when he was fifteen but
became a professional boxer at
the experienced age of nineteen.
After winning twenty-six
consecutive boxing matches he
lost his twenty-seventh and
decided it was time to quit. He
doesn't have time for sports
anymore, and besides, "you can't
invite anyone over on Sunday
afternoon and say, 'Let's bash
heads'."
"Fear and hunger" motivated
him to pursue a career in acting.
His sister was responsible for
getting him interested in the
theater and in short time he found
himself as a villain in a Hopalong
Cassidy film.
Mitchum has sixty-three films
to his credit and is in the process
of looking through fourteen
prospective scripts. When deciding
on a role he considers "the
amount of effort, absence of
tedium, the location, days off,
friendliness of the people on the
set, and money," not necessarily
in that order. But, despite twenty
years in the movies he honestly
contends that he doesn't like to
work. "It inhibits my freedom. I
really don't like to do anything
anyway."
Screenwriter Robert Bolt and
director David Lean who worked
on "LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"
and "DOCTOR ZHIVAGO"
together wrote an original
screenplay and wanted Mitchum
to portray the schoolmaster
husband in a triangular love story
set in 1916 Ireland. "I told Bobby

I couldn't because I was going to
commit suicide. He offered to pay
my funeral expenses if I
consented to do the picture fifst. I
consented."
Many critics speculate that his
role in "RYAN'S DAUGHTER" is
the one that will win Robert
Mitchum the Academy Award.
Asked if it would mean anything,
he said, "I better say yes. Actually
it will mean that my wife will get
a new dress and I'll go to the
theater that night."

premier November 9 in New
York.
Actors and directors are
usually sent around the country
to promote their latest efforts and
find themselves subjected to the
same stupid questions at least a
hundred times before their tour of
duty is up. Mitchum sees these
sessions as part of his obligation

and approaches them with the
same lack of fervor that he
approaches his role as an actor.
San Francisco was his last stop
before he went home to "check
on the laundry."
The actor was confronted by
half a dozen college students in
his room at the Fairmont and
naturally the conversation began
with the subject of politics.
Mitchum rambled on for half an
hour about African tribal politics
trying to make the point that

revolution is a never ending
process. So much for politics.
Mitchum explained that he
began his career as a writer for
radio when he was fifteen but
became a professional boxer at
the experienced age of nineteen.
After winning twenty-six
consecutive boxing matches he
lost his twenty-seventh and
decided it was time to quit. He
doesn't have time for sports
anymore, and besides, "you can't
invite anyone over on Sunday
afternoon and say, 'Let's bash
heads'."
"Fear and hunger" motivated
him to pursue a career in acting.
His sister was responsible for
getting him interested in the
theater and in short time he found
himself as a villain in a Hopalong
Cassidy film.
Mitchum has sixty-three films
to his credit and is in the process
of looking through fourteen
prospective scripts. When deciding
on a role he considers "the
amount of effort, absence of
tedium, the location, days off,
friendliness of the people on the
set, and money," not necessarily
in that order. But, despite twenty
years in the movies he honestly
contends that he doesn't like to
work. "It inhibits my freedom. I
really don't like to do anything
anyway."
Screenwriter Robert Bolt and
director David Lean who worked
on "LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"
and "DOCTOR ZHIVAGO"
together wrote an original
screenplay and wanted Mitchum
to portray the schoolmaster
husband in a triangular love story
set in 1916 Ireland. "I told Bobby

I couldn't because I was going to
commit suicide. He offered to pay
my funeral expenses if I
consented to do the picture fifst. I
consented."
Many critics speculate that his
role in "RYAN'S DAUGHTER" is
the one that will win Robert
Mitchum the Academy Award.
Asked if it would mean anything,
he said, "I better say yes. Actually
it will mean that my wife will get
a new dress and I'll go to the
theater that night."

duty is up. Mitchum sees these
sessions as part of his obligation

and approaches them with the
same lack of fervor that he
approaches his role as an actor.
San Francisco was his last stop
before he went home to "check
on the laundry."
The actor was confronted by
half a dozen college students in
his room at the Fairmont and
naturally the conversation began
with the subject of politics.
Mitchum rambled on for half an
hour about African tribal politics
trying to make the point that

revolution is a never ending
process. So much for politics.
Mitchum explained that he
began his career as a writer for
radio when he was fifteen but
became a professional boxer at
the experienced age of nineteen.
After winning twenty-six
consecutive boxing matches he
lost his twenty-seventh and
decided it was time to quit. He
doesn't have time for sports
anymore, and besides, "you can't
invite anyone over on Sunday
afternoon and say, 'Let's bash
heads'."
"Fear and hunger" motivated
him to pursue a career in acting.
His sister was responsible for
getting him interested in the
theater and in short time he found
himself as a villain in a Hopalong
Cassidy film.
Mitchum has sixty-three films
to his credit and is in the process
of looking through fourteen
prospective scripts. When deciding
on a role he considers "the
amount of effort, absence of
tedium, the location, days off,
friendliness of the people on the
set, and money," not necessarily
in that order. But, despite twenty
years in the movies he honestly
contends that he doesn't like to
work. "It inhibits my freedom. I
really don't like to do anything
anyway."
Screenwriter Robert Bolt and
director David Lean who worked
on "LAWRENCE OF ARABIA"
and "DOCTOR ZHIVAGO"
together wrote an original
screenplay and wanted Mitchum
to portray the schoolmaster
husband in a triangular love story
set in 1916 Ireland. "I told Bobby

I couldn't because I was going to
commit suicide. He offered to pay
my funeral expenses if I
consented to do the picture fifst. I
consented."
Many critics speculate that his
role in "RYAN'S DAUGHTER" is
the one that will win Robert
Mitchum the Academy Award.
Asked if it would mean anything,
he said, "I better say yes. Actually
it will mean that my wife will get
a new dress and I'll go to the
theater that night."
