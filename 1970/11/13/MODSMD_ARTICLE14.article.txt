# 'Seagull' A Success
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Drama Department
opened its 1970 season of
Undergraduate Studio
Productions Wednesday night
with Anton Chekov's "The Sea
Gull."
Chekhov is a playwright that
amateurs should tackle with great
care. His plays are quiet, subtle,
and in a way extremely gentle, as
he probes into the deepest
recesses of his characters. These
characters are invariably drawn
from the upper middle class
Russian society of the late
nineteenth century.
That was the beginning of the
Russian revolutionary period, and
probably because the
revolutionaries won, we tend to
think of Russia at that time as
being a country plagued with
dissension, persecution and social
unrest.
In fact, Russia was such a
country. But the people in
Chekhov's plays are merely feeling
the breezes. It will be several years
before the storrn hits. Most of
them realize that change is
coming, and are a bit upset by it.
But these cannot be the tyrants
against whom the Revolution has
directed so much invective. They
are quiet, sophisticated people,
living their personal lives in a way
which no one could possibly fault.
They merely ignore the misery
around them; and so it goes away.
To play characters such as
these, requires a certain amount
of maturity, both as a person and
as an actor. Therefore, it was with
some trepidation that I
approached this production; I am
happy to say that, with a few
exceptions, my fears were
groundless. It is a very satisfying
production of a very difficult
play, and I recommend it with no
hesitation.
Before I launch into the
standard rundown of cast and
director, I must mention the
outstanding job done by Robbie
Levitow in the part of Arkidina.
To lump Miss Levitow with the
rest would be to do her an
injustice, for as fine as the produc
tion may have been, Miss Levitow
stood way above it.
Arkadina must be a devilishly
difficulty part for an
undergraduate. She is an aging
actesss determined to hang onto
her youth, still living the glory of
her days on the Moscow stage.
Miss Levitow is only a junior, but
she brings to the part such poise,
such stage presence, such
consistency, that it was a pleasure
to watch her and hear her. If she
were made-up to look a little
older, the effect would have been
perfect. But that is no reflection
on Miss Levitow's work—she is a
fine actesss, and I hope Stanford
will be seeing more of her.
Fine Cast
The rest of the cast was, in
general, very good. Bob Fletcher

palys Trigorin, the closest thing
this play has to a heavy. He is a
villain with the Dry Look, sort of
a riverboat gambler, a' la Russe.
Mr. Fletcher is charming, modest,
and maddeningly ingratiating. He
is the type who slips the knife in
quietly, never disturbing the
serenity of the play.
Special praise must also go to
Thomas Cushing as Dorn,
Margaret Hasse as Paulina and
Steve Levin as Sorin.
The only real disappointments
were Peter Samelson as the
sensitive Konstantine and Carlisle
Ellis as Nina. Mr. Samelson seems
hyperactive rather than sensitive
or distraught. Perhaps it's because
the rest of the characters are so
quiet, but Mr. Samelson does
seem to be overreacting. Miss Ellis
has the opposite problem. For
three out of the four scenes she
cannot seem to bring herself up to
the level of the rest of the
company. Since she has, in effect,
the title role, this is a bit
distressing. She is much better in

the last scene, however, which
saves the end of the play.
Richard Geldard had his work
cut out for him as director, and he
has done a fine job. Given
Chekhov, amateur actors, and a
three quarter stage, he has put
together a production which
consistently brings out subtle
characterizations, almost always
keeps the incredibly entangled
alliances of the characters clear,
and which moves along at a slow,
quiet, country atmosphere pace.
I have only one complaint:
While Chekhov is certainly not a
playwright to rush, the pace
sometimes was so slow that the
play seemed to stop. This
happened in Trigorin's long scene
at the end of the first act, and
again several times during the
second act. It seemed about to
happen again when the play
suddenly ended with a slow fade
of the lights, leaving some of the
audience a bit bewildered.
"The Sea Gull" will be shown
this weekend, and next
Wednesday through Saturday.

keeps the incredibly entangled
alliances of the characters clear,
and which moves along at a slow,
quiet, country atmosphere pace.
I have only one complaint:
While Chekhov is certainly not a
playwright to rush, the pace
sometimes was so slow that the
play seemed to stop. This
happened in Trigorin's long scene
at the end of the first act, and
again several times during the
second act. It seemed about to
happen again when the play
suddenly ended with a slow fade
of the lights, leaving some of the
audience a bit bewildered.
"The Sea Gull" will be shown
this weekend, and next
Wednesday through Saturday.
The Drama Department
opened its 1970 season of
Undergraduate Studio
Productions Wednesday night
with Anton Chekov's "The Sea
Gull."
Chekhov is a playwright that
amateurs should tackle with great
care. His plays are quiet, subtle,
and in a way extremely gentle, as
he probes into the deepest
recesses of his characters. These
characters are invariably drawn
from the upper middle class
Russian society of the late
nineteenth century.
That was the beginning of the
Russian revolutionary period, and
probably because the
revolutionaries won, we tend to
think of Russia at that time as
being a country plagued with
dissension, persecution and social
unrest.
In fact, Russia was such a
country. But the people in
Chekhov's plays are merely feeling
the breezes. It will be several years
before the storrn hits. Most of
them realize that change is
coming, and are a bit upset by it.
But these cannot be the tyrants
against whom the Revolution has
directed so much invective. They
are quiet, sophisticated people,
living their personal lives in a way
which no one could possibly fault.
They merely ignore the misery
around them; and so it goes away.
To play characters such as
these, requires a certain amount
of maturity, both as a person and
as an actor. Therefore, it was with
some trepidation that I
approached this production; I am
happy to say that, with a few
exceptions, my fears were
groundless. It is a very satisfying
production of a very difficult
play, and I recommend it with no
hesitation.
Before I launch into the
standard rundown of cast and
director, I must mention the
outstanding job done by Robbie
Levitow in the part of Arkidina.
To lump Miss Levitow with the
rest would be to do her an
injustice, for as fine as the produc
tion may have been, Miss Levitow
stood way above it.
Arkadina must be a devilishly
difficulty part for an
undergraduate. She is an aging
actesss determined to hang onto
her youth, still living the glory of
her days on the Moscow stage.
Miss Levitow is only a junior, but
she brings to the part such poise,
such stage presence, such
consistency, that it was a pleasure
to watch her and hear her. If she
were made-up to look a little
older, the effect would have been
perfect. But that is no reflection
on Miss Levitow's work—she is a
fine actesss, and I hope Stanford
will be seeing more of her.
Fine Cast
The rest of the cast was, in
general, very good. Bob Fletcher

palys Trigorin, the closest thing
this play has to a heavy. He is a
villain with the Dry Look, sort of
a riverboat gambler, a' la Russe.
Mr. Fletcher is charming, modest,
and maddeningly ingratiating. He
is the type who slips the knife in
quietly, never disturbing the
serenity of the play.
Special praise must also go to
Thomas Cushing as Dorn,
Margaret Hasse as Paulina and
Steve Levin as Sorin.
The only real disappointments
were Peter Samelson as the
sensitive Konstantine and Carlisle
Ellis as Nina. Mr. Samelson seems
hyperactive rather than sensitive
or distraught. Perhaps it's because
the rest of the characters are so
quiet, but Mr. Samelson does
seem to be overreacting. Miss Ellis
has the opposite problem. For
three out of the four scenes she
cannot seem to bring herself up to
the level of the rest of the
company. Since she has, in effect,
the title role, this is a bit
distressing. She is much better in

the last scene, however, which
saves the end of the play.
Richard Geldard had his work
cut out for him as director, and he
has done a fine job. Given
Chekhov, amateur actors, and a
three quarter stage, he has put
together a production which
consistently brings out subtle
characterizations, almost always
keeps the incredibly entangled
alliances of the characters clear,
and which moves along at a slow,
quiet, country atmosphere pace.

seem to be overreacting. Miss Ellis
has the opposite problem. For
three out of the four scenes she
cannot seem to bring herself up to
the level of the rest of the
company. Since she has, in effect,
the title role, this is a bit
distressing. She is much better in

the last scene, however, which
saves the end of the play.
Richard Geldard had his work
cut out for him as director, and he
has done a fine job. Given
Chekhov, amateur actors, and a
three quarter stage, he has put
together a production which
consistently brings out subtle
characterizations, almost always
keeps the incredibly entangled
alliances of the characters clear,
and which moves along at a slow,
quiet, country atmosphere pace.
I have only one complaint:
While Chekhov is certainly not a
playwright to rush, the pace
sometimes was so slow that the
play seemed to stop. This
happened in Trigorin's long scene
at the end of the first act, and
again several times during the
second act. It seemed about to
happen again when the play
suddenly ended with a slow fade
of the lights, leaving some of the
audience a bit bewildered.
"The Sea Gull" will be shown
this weekend, and next
Wednesday through Saturday.
