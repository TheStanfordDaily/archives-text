# Indians Object
## Mascot Caricature Dropped 
### 
It has disappeared from the
shelves of the bookstore. Gone are
the T-shirts, the decals and the
ashtrays which bear the caricature
of the Stanford Indian.
The short dumpy figure with
the oversized nose will no longer
symbolize the athletic efforts of
Stanford University. Although the
mascot of the school is still
nominally the Indian, the
traditional cartoon representation

of the mascot has been
condemned as a racist stereotype.
The action came as the result
of objections by Indian students.
"Everyone was offended by it,"
said John White of Tecumseh
House, Stanford's Indian Cultural
Center. "The equivalent ethnic
stereotypes of the Jew with a big
nose and curls and dollar bills
stuffed in his pockets, or of a
pickaninny with a watermelon

were dropped years ago."
"We appreciate that everyone
involved was so cooperative,"
added White. "As soon as people
thought about it they realized
that it was inappropriate."
. The change came as something
of a shock to the Governor Time
Co., manufacturers of the Ronald
Reagan and USC Trojan
wristwatches. Capitalizing on
Stanford's Rose Bowl efforts, the
company designed a Stanford
Indian watch. The advertisement

they sought to place in the Daily
was refused.
"I'm dumbfounded," said
Silvio Delligatta, when informed
that the ad had been cancelled.
"We didn't mean to offend
Indians. We thought that was the
Stanford Indian. This is new to
us."
Governor Time may follow the
lead of the Athletic Department,
and redesign the watch using a
more favorable portrayal of the
Indian. The Stanford Sports News
letterhead now carries the profile
of a Plains Indian Chief which
somewhat resembles the mascot
of the Chicago Black Hawks.
In some cases the alteration
will involve some expense. For
example, ASSU paychecks, pay
requests and purchase orders
formerly showed ten little Indians
in the upper left hand corner, the
front one thumbing his nose.
"We've been ordered by the
Provost's office to delete the
Indians completely," reports
Silvia Harvey of the ASSU office.
"They don't know what they'll
put in place of it. The initial
printing order will cost $35 more
for new plates."
There are now 26 Indian
undergraduates at Stanford, 22 of
them freshmen. This year marked
the first time that a sizable
number of Indians were included
in the freshman class.
