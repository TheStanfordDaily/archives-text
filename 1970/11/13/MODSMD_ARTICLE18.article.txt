# Falcons Await Indians

"We want to go to that bowl
10-1," tight end Bob Moore said
last week after Stanford had
finally worked its way to the Rose
Bowl.
"We're really gonna play a
couple great football games now.
We've bt a little tight at times,
but I think now we'll really break
through. Being able to relax will
help a lot."
Relax?
"First Air Force Academy ball
carrier to rush for more than
1,000 yards in a season is junior
tailback Brian Bream. .." says the
sheet.
"Senior flanker Ernie Jennings
is the first academy player to gain
more than 1 ,000 yards in a season
by pass receiving," it continues.
Relax in the thin and freezing
air of Colorado Springs,
Colorado?
That's the prospect for 4 7
varsity football players who left at
7:15 this morning for a 1 p.m.
game with the Air Force
tomorrow.
The Falcons, who were beaten
for the first time this season last
week at Oregon, need the win if
they still hope to get invited to
some sort of bowl.
Nothing can keep Stanford
from Pasadena now, but as Moore
says, the Indians would rather go
there 10-1 instead of 8-3 or 9-2.
And if the Indians want to help
Jim Plunk ett in the Heisman
Trophy race, they can't afford
another loss.
The Falcons, meanwhile, have
a quarterback of considerable
repute, too. Bob Parker, Rhodes
Scholarship candidate, has thrown

158 passes in nine games—four
more than Plunkett—for a total of
2294 yards, 41 more than our
local hero. Jim, however, has the
edge in total offense, 2424 to
2291.
Receiver Jennings is eighth in
the nation with 5 6 receptions and
1 055 yards and tailback Bream is
fifth in rushing with 1096 yards
and—get this—lB touchdowns to
lead the nation in scoring.
Then there's the weather.
Snow was predicted for Thursday
night and clearing skies for today
and tomorrow.
And then there's the altitude,
something like 6100 feet at
Falcon Stadium. "That's no
problem," claims Coach John
Ralston. "We've been there
before. In fact, we played one of
our best fourth-quarters there five
years ago."
The score of that one was
17-16, Stanford.
A break for Stanford has been
the rapid recovery of first-string
Hillary Shockley who stretched
knee ligaments in the first half last
week and didn't figure to make
the Colorado trip.
But Hillary was running at
nearly full speed by the end of the
week's practice and may even
start. If he can't go the whole
game he'll alternate with Jim
Kehl.
Flanker Demea Washington,
who has had hamstring problems
for weeks, pulled it again in pass
practice Monday and won't make
the trip. Aside from . that,
Stanford goes into the game at
full strength.
The Falcons haven't been
playing one of the rougher

schedules around, but it's hard to
overlook that they are seventh in
the nation in total offense, fifth in
passing offense, ninth in scoring
and ranked 12 th in the polls.
It should be close and it should
be exciting. And if Stanford wins,
it might even be relaxing.
