# Cards In Pullman For League Race

### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's varsity cross
country team will travel to
Washington State University to
compete in the meet that they
have been preparing for all season,
the Pacific-8 championship which
will be run over a six-mile course
this Saturday.
The Indian runners have
soundly defeated the three Pac-8
opponents they have faced this
year. On October 17, the Cards
trounced a good USC team here
by the score of 24 to 46. Arvid
Dretz, Don Kardong, and Robert
Doe all broke UCLA's course
record in leading Stanford to a
21-34 win over the Bruins on
October 24. Finally, last week,
the Indian harriers dumped
California in a lackluster
performance at Berkeley.
Stanford will go into the Pac-8
championship with three
important wins over conference
rivals, but not having faced the
two strongest teams in the
conference, Oregon and
Washington State. Oregon finished
first in last year's championship
held on the Stanford golf course.
No other Pac-8 school was able to
approach the power of the
powerful Ducks. Oregon has most
of its runners back this year and is
favored to win the meet.
Washington has showed great
improvement this year and should
be strong enough to challenge for
the Pac-8 crown.
Stanford's chances rest on the
recovery of Robert Coe from his
knee injury and the whole squad
from its uninspired showing

against the Bears last week. Unless
the Indian runners run better and
bring their times closer together,
USC,UCLA, or Cal could place in
front of them in the conference.
In a meet of that size, anything
can happen and it is conceivable
that Stanford could muster the
strength to surprise Oregon and
win a berth in the NCAA meet to
be held on November 23 rd at
William and Mary.
If Stanford's runners can pull
together and recapture the power
they displayed against UCLA,
they have an excellent chance of
placing high in the meet and
possibly challenging Oregon for
the championship.
