# Liberation Front To Stop Big Game
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
"The Big Game will not be played."
This was the word yesterday from a
spokesman for the People's Athletic
Liberation who claimed that
negotiations between themselves and
the California and Stanford Athletic
Departments over a list of five demands
had failed to materialize.
Wednesday morning in Berkeley, the
PAL, which includes representatives
from the Gay Liberation Front,
Women's Liberation, the Youth
International Party, SDS, and the Jock
Liberation Front, presented a list of
five demands at a press conference
which they claimed must be met before
the Big Game can be played.
The five demands were: (1) free
admission to the Big Game and all
subsequent Cal and Stanford athletic
events; (2) an end to drug abuse in
sports; (3) elimination of brutality and
needless injury in sports; (4) the
involvement of athletes, students and
faculty and the community in the
operation of the school's athletic
departments; (5) a representative
committee from the Berkeley and
Stanford communities to determine the
Big Game halftime show.
Other long run demands of the
group include an entire restructuring of
all sports: "We call for the players to
democratically choose the lineups of all

sports and that all coaches must sit in
the stands during the game. We call for
the elimination of all officials and
referees from athletic events so as to
build trust among the players. We are
also in favor of abolishing the official
score so as to break down the
competitive ethic and aid the

participants in maintaining a more
humane social, economic and political
outlook.
Athletic Directors Won't Meet
National spokesman for the PAL,
Con O'Leary, a University of Kansas
graduate student claimed today that
negotiations fell through. "Cal Athletic
Director Dr. Paul Brechler refused to
talk to us and Stanford Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor talked to us, but
refused to meet and negotiate."
Contacted later in the afternoon,
Brechler's secretary claimed that he was
out of town and that she had set up an
appointment for them (the PAL) on

Tuesday afternoon. She added that
"they were very rude when they talked
to me."
When he saw a copy of the demands
on Wednesday afternoon Taylor said,
"I don't see any purpose in talking to
themsincethey are only making a pure
attack on intercollegiate athletic

activities and are trying to destroy it."
Taylor also said that he had contacted
Brechler earlier and he didn't think
Brechler was about to negotiate either.
Another spokesman for the PAL,
Sam Goldberg, minister .of sports for
the Youth International Party, was on
campus yesterday and talked about
what the people's action (O'Leary
mentioned) might constitute.
Goldberg said: "We intend to have
every yippie in the country at the Big
Game for a yip-in. It will be part of our

total offensive against the American pig
power structure. Yippie caravans will
be coming in from as far away as
Canada and Mexico.
"We are picking the Big Game as the
target of our attack because it is bigger
than the Super Bowl in the Bay Area.
Our offensive is directed towards this
sack tradition that represents the
cultural prostitution of sports. The Big
Game is a tradition that reaffirms
values which are the strength of
Amerika—brutality, drugs and rape.
"The Big Game symbolizes a
militantly business as usual attitude. It
is an example of "overkill" in which
the purpose is to annihilate your
opponent. We will take any action
necessary to stop it."
Kansas Jog-In
Goldberg is a nationally ranked
decathalon performer who was kicked
off the Kansas University track team
last spring. He organized a Jock
Liberation Front jog-in at Kansas in
October which was halted by massive
police security at the football stadium,
proposed site of the incident.
According to Goldberg, the joggers
had brought wire cutters to tear down

California turf for this year if the Big Game is canceled. The People's Athletic
Liberation has called for a massive Yip-in to protest exploitation of athletes and
the cultural prostitution of sports.
the fence and "we intended to liberate
the stadium and play touch football
and frisbee. But when we saw the 75
highway patrol cars and other pigs we
decided against going through with it."
Goldberg and Randy Smith are
leaders of the Woodstock Nation
Athletic Association which plans to
compete in this year's indoor AAU
track season. Their ideal is to make an
athlete the artist he is and to turn the
passive consumers into participants
themselves."
Wednesday Goldberg said that as
more and more athletes become aware
of the "Big Business idea of Amerikan
sports," we will see them "melt down
their medals and trophies to make
bullets for the revolution. Any athlete
who is serious about liberation and the

revolution must be prepared to kill his
eoarh."
Chicago Seven defendant Tom
Hayden added his support to the
movement at Wednesday's press
conference and Goldberg says that
Jerry Rubin and possibly Abbie
Hoffman will be out here for the game.
Other notables at the press conference
included Jack Scott, head of the
Institute for the Study of Sport in
Society, an outgrowth of controversial
sociology course he taught at Cal last
year.
The PAL'ers have announced
tentative plans for a press conference
next Wednesday in which they will
announce further plans for the format
of their Jog-In and disruption. Both the
Cal and Stanford athletic departments
appear to feel that the game will go on.
It should be quite a day.

more and more athletes become aware
of the "Big Business idea of Amerikan
sports," we will see them "melt down
their medals and trophies to make
bullets for the revolution. Any athlete
who is serious about liberation and the

revolution must be prepared to kill his
eoarh."
Chicago Seven defendant Tom
Hayden added his support to the
movement at Wednesday's press
conference and Goldberg says that
Jerry Rubin and possibly Abbie
Hoffman will be out here for the game.
Other notables at the press conference
included Jack Scott, head of the
Institute for the Study of Sport in
Society, an outgrowth of controversial
sociology course he taught at Cal last
year.
The PAL'ers have announced
tentative plans for a press conference
next Wednesday in which they will
announce further plans for the format
of their Jog-In and disruption. Both the
Cal and Stanford athletic departments
appear to feel that the game will go on.
It should be quite a day.
"The Big Game will not be played."
This was the word yesterday from a
spokesman for the People's Athletic
Liberation who claimed that
negotiations between themselves and
the California and Stanford Athletic
Departments over a list of five demands
had failed to materialize.
Wednesday morning in Berkeley, the
PAL, which includes representatives
from the Gay Liberation Front,
Women's Liberation, the Youth
International Party, SDS, and the Jock
Liberation Front, presented a list of
five demands at a press conference
which they claimed must be met before
the Big Game can be played.
The five demands were: (1) free
admission to the Big Game and all
subsequent Cal and Stanford athletic
events; (2) an end to drug abuse in
sports; (3) elimination of brutality and
needless injury in sports; (4) the
involvement of athletes, students and
faculty and the community in the
operation of the school's athletic
departments; (5) a representative
committee from the Berkeley and
Stanford communities to determine the
Big Game halftime show.
Other long run demands of the
group include an entire restructuring of
all sports: "We call for the players to
democratically choose the lineups of all

sports and that all coaches must sit in
the stands during the game. We call for
the elimination of all officials and
referees from athletic events so as to
build trust among the players. We are
also in favor of abolishing the official
score so as to break down the
competitive ethic and aid the

participants in maintaining a more
humane social, economic and political
outlook.
Athletic Directors Won't Meet
National spokesman for the PAL,
Con O'Leary, a University of Kansas
graduate student claimed today that
negotiations fell through. "Cal Athletic
Director Dr. Paul Brechler refused to
talk to us and Stanford Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor talked to us, but
refused to meet and negotiate."
Contacted later in the afternoon,
Brechler's secretary claimed that he was
out of town and that she had set up an
appointment for them (the PAL) on

Tuesday afternoon. She added that
"they were very rude when they talked
to me."
When he saw a copy of the demands
on Wednesday afternoon Taylor said,
"I don't see any purpose in talking to
themsincethey are only making a pure
attack on intercollegiate athletic

activities and are trying to destroy it."
Taylor also said that he had contacted
Brechler earlier and he didn't think
Brechler was about to negotiate either.
Another spokesman for the PAL,
Sam Goldberg, minister .of sports for
the Youth International Party, was on
campus yesterday and talked about
what the people's action (O'Leary
mentioned) might constitute.
Goldberg said: "We intend to have
every yippie in the country at the Big
Game for a yip-in. It will be part of our

total offensive against the American pig
power structure. Yippie caravans will
be coming in from as far away as
Canada and Mexico.
"We are picking the Big Game as the
target of our attack because it is bigger
than the Super Bowl in the Bay Area.
Our offensive is directed towards this
sack tradition that represents the
cultural prostitution of sports. The Big
Game is a tradition that reaffirms
values which are the strength of
Amerika—brutality, drugs and rape.
"The Big Game symbolizes a
militantly business as usual attitude. It
is an example of "overkill" in which
the purpose is to annihilate your
opponent. We will take any action
necessary to stop it."
Kansas Jog-In
Goldberg is a nationally ranked
decathalon performer who was kicked
off the Kansas University track team
last spring. He organized a Jock
Liberation Front jog-in at Kansas in
October which was halted by massive
police security at the football stadium,
proposed site of the incident.
According to Goldberg, the joggers
had brought wire cutters to tear down

California turf for this year if the Big Game is canceled. The People's Athletic
Liberation has called for a massive Yip-in to protest exploitation of athletes and
the cultural prostitution of sports.
the fence and "we intended to liberate
the stadium and play touch football
and frisbee. But when we saw the 75
highway patrol cars and other pigs we
decided against going through with it."
Goldberg and Randy Smith are
leaders of the Woodstock Nation
Athletic Association which plans to
compete in this year's indoor AAU
track season. Their ideal is to make an
athlete the artist he is and to turn the
passive consumers into participants
themselves."

Institute for the Study of Sport in
Society, an outgrowth of controversial
sociology course he taught at Cal last
year.
The PAL'ers have announced
tentative plans for a press conference
next Wednesday in which they will
announce further plans for the format
of their Jog-In and disruption. Both the
Cal and Stanford athletic departments
appear to feel that the game will go on.
It should be quite a day.
"The Big Game will not be played."
This was the word yesterday from a
spokesman for the People's Athletic
Liberation who claimed that
negotiations between themselves and
the California and Stanford Athletic
Departments over a list of five demands
had failed to materialize.
Wednesday morning in Berkeley, the
PAL, which includes representatives
from the Gay Liberation Front,
Women's Liberation, the Youth
International Party, SDS, and the Jock
Liberation Front, presented a list of
five demands at a press conference
which they claimed must be met before
the Big Game can be played.
The five demands were: (1) free
admission to the Big Game and all
subsequent Cal and Stanford athletic
events; (2) an end to drug abuse in
sports; (3) elimination of brutality and
needless injury in sports; (4) the
involvement of athletes, students and
faculty and the community in the
operation of the school's athletic
departments; (5) a representative
committee from the Berkeley and
Stanford communities to determine the
Big Game halftime show.
Other long run demands of the
group include an entire restructuring of
all sports: "We call for the players to
democratically choose the lineups of all

sports and that all coaches must sit in
the stands during the game. We call for
the elimination of all officials and
referees from athletic events so as to
build trust among the players. We are
also in favor of abolishing the official
score so as to break down the
competitive ethic and aid the

participants in maintaining a more
humane social, economic and political
outlook.
Athletic Directors Won't Meet
National spokesman for the PAL,
Con O'Leary, a University of Kansas
graduate student claimed today that
negotiations fell through. "Cal Athletic
Director Dr. Paul Brechler refused to
talk to us and Stanford Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor talked to us, but
refused to meet and negotiate."
Contacted later in the afternoon,
Brechler's secretary claimed that he was
out of town and that she had set up an
appointment for them (the PAL) on

Tuesday afternoon. She added that
"they were very rude when they talked
to me."
When he saw a copy of the demands
on Wednesday afternoon Taylor said,
"I don't see any purpose in talking to
themsincethey are only making a pure
attack on intercollegiate athletic

activities and are trying to destroy it."
Taylor also said that he had contacted
Brechler earlier and he didn't think
Brechler was about to negotiate either.
Another spokesman for the PAL,
Sam Goldberg, minister .of sports for
the Youth International Party, was on
campus yesterday and talked about
what the people's action (O'Leary
mentioned) might constitute.
Goldberg said: "We intend to have
every yippie in the country at the Big
Game for a yip-in. It will be part of our

total offensive against the American pig
power structure. Yippie caravans will
be coming in from as far away as
Canada and Mexico.
"We are picking the Big Game as the
target of our attack because it is bigger
than the Super Bowl in the Bay Area.
Our offensive is directed towards this
sack tradition that represents the
cultural prostitution of sports. The Big
Game is a tradition that reaffirms
values which are the strength of
Amerika—brutality, drugs and rape.
"The Big Game symbolizes a
militantly business as usual attitude. It
is an example of "overkill" in which
the purpose is to annihilate your
opponent. We will take any action
necessary to stop it."
Kansas Jog-In
Goldberg is a nationally ranked
decathalon performer who was kicked
off the Kansas University track team
last spring. He organized a Jock
Liberation Front jog-in at Kansas in
October which was halted by massive
police security at the football stadium,
proposed site of the incident.
According to Goldberg, the joggers
had brought wire cutters to tear down

California turf for this year if the Big Game is canceled. The People's Athletic
Liberation has called for a massive Yip-in to protest exploitation of athletes and
the cultural prostitution of sports.
the fence and "we intended to liberate
the stadium and play touch football
and frisbee. But when we saw the 75
highway patrol cars and other pigs we
decided against going through with it."
Goldberg and Randy Smith are
leaders of the Woodstock Nation
Athletic Association which plans to
compete in this year's indoor AAU
track season. Their ideal is to make an
athlete the artist he is and to turn the
passive consumers into participants
themselves."
Wednesday Goldberg said that as
more and more athletes become aware
of the "Big Business idea of Amerikan
sports," we will see them "melt down
their medals and trophies to make
bullets for the revolution. Any athlete
who is serious about liberation and the

revolution must be prepared to kill his
eoarh."
Chicago Seven defendant Tom
Hayden added his support to the
movement at Wednesday's press
conference and Goldberg says that
Jerry Rubin and possibly Abbie
Hoffman will be out here for the game.
