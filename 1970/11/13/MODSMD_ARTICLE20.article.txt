### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Ken Peterson sipped a beer,
and leaned back in the chair
behind his desk, as a cluster of
reporters crowded into his small
office at the Band Shak.
The diminutive band manager's
voice was void of emotion, but he
was obviously pleased as he began
to speak. "We've been pointing to
this one for eight years," he said.
"It's been an uphill struggle with
many disappointments, but it was
a team effort, and every one of
those 140 guys deserves the
credit."
Peterson's 140 guys consisted
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University Marching Band, a
group that moments earlier had
marched itself into its first Rose
Bowl since 1951.
"We started off slowly, losing a
heart-breaker to Arkansas,"
Peterson continued, "but we told
ourselves we were better than
that."
Since that early season loss, the
band has gone undefeated and
untied in eight successive games.

Geordie Lawry, the
band's field leader stumbled into
the office, apparently fatigued
from a marathon autograph
session, and, in the same
low-keyed manner, began talking
about the LSJUMB victory.
"I guess it really hasn't hit us
yet," said Lawry, known to his
teammates as HTC because he is
being pushed as Stanford's Heart
Transplant Candidate for 1970.
"We were well-drilled for this
game, and what is particularly
gratifying to me is the fact that
we won the clincher on national
television after having lost the
opener in front of a national
audience."
Lawry discounted earlier
reports from Los Angeles that he
had a sore whistle. It was feared
by some that this sort of ailment
would hamper the band's
performance.
No Problem
"My whistle hasn't been sore at
all this year," insisted Lawry,
"and at no time was I worried
that the band would blow it."
Looking ahead, the band
management cited a couple of
goals it'd like to achieve before
the end of the regular season.
"We'd like to get that transplant
for Geordie, and beating Cal
would certainly end the season on
a high note," said Peterson.
Peterson was also quick to
acknowledge the support of the
Stanford football team, which will
accompany the band to Pasadena
on New Year's Day. "They've
done a tremendous job this year,
and have really given us a helluva
lot of support. I don't think they
missed a game this year, and we've
been in a lot of 'em.
