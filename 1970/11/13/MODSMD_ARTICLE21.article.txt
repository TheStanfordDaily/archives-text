Scoring, scoring, scoring. That
was the story of Intramural
football action this week, despite
persistent rains that made the
fields muddy and the footing
trickv.
Scores were not only high but
also very lopsided. The best
example of this was the Phi
Kap-Theta XI game, where the Phi
Kaps, with their famed
point-a-minute offense
functioning smoothly, obliterated
their hapless opponents, 62 4).
In similar contests, Beta beat
Phi Sig, 33-0; Cedro downed
Lx>ro, 25-0; Zete smashed Theta
Chi, 33-0; and Dislocations
smothered Biz 11, 32-6. In closer
games, Med I topped Nemesis,
19-7, and Donncr edged Madera,
12-6.
Then there was the
Cuadro-Toro game. Sparked by
pleas of "Who's got the club
football?", Cuadro had hoped to
"even" its record at 1-3 by
winning the game they had been
pointing towards all season.
However, with captain Howard
O'Brien on the sidelines, Cuadro's
visions of victory vanished as they
went down to glorious defeat,
39-0.
