Heyns To Resign?
LOS ANGELES — The resignation of Roger W.
Heyns, chancellor of the University of California at
Berkeley, may be announced Friday, the Los Angeles
Times reports.
The newspaper said Heyns has been losing favor
among conservative members of the University of
California Board or Regents.
A spokesman for Heyns said he could neither
confirm not deny the newspaper report. Heyns could
not be reached for comment.
Heyns suffered a mild heart attack last July, and
his health was thought to be a factor in his retirement
decision, the Times said.
A former vice president of academic affairs at the
University of Michigan, Heyns, 52, was installed as
chancellor of the Berkeley campus in 1955.
He succeeded Martin Meyerson, who served as
acting chancellor after the resignation of Edward W.
Strong following campus disruptions involving the
Berkeley free speech disorders in 1964.
The Times said Heyns had reached his decision to
retire several days ago and would announce it by the
end of this week.
UA W Contract
DETROIT -- Representatives of 394,0 00 striking
General Motors workers approved Thursday a new
contract which one union executive said would raise
wages and fringe benefits by $1.80 an hour in three
years.
The United Auto Workers' 35 0-member GM
Council listened to union leaders explain the terms of
the tentative agreement for 5-1 /2 hours before
deciding by a 4-1 margin to recommend it to the
union's membership.
"I want to tell you I am not satisfied with this
package," UAW President Leonard Woodcock told
the Council. "But there comes a point of time in the
battle when gains to be made have to be weighed
against the hardships to be inflicted on the troops,
who are waging the front-line battle."
Contract provisions, withheld until Thursday's GM
council meeting, included:
—An average first-year wage increase of 51 cents
an hour, improved by 3 percent in each of the last
two years of the pact. The current average hourly
wage of a GM worker is $4 .02 .

—Restoration of unlimited cost-of-living
allowances under which wages are raised up or down
in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price
Index.
-Retirement at $5 00 a month after 30 years
service for persons age 58 in the second year of the
contract and at age 56 in the third year.
Bard Young, a regional director and executive
board member, estimated it would take at least a
week for local unions to complete their ratification
vote. And he said it might take considerably longer in
locals currently without at-the-plant settlements.
The local contracts, which supplement the
national agreement, remain unsettled at 68 of GM's
155 bargaining units in the United States. That figure
includes 18 of 2 4 assembly plants and 12 of 54
so-called key plants.
Minn. Lowers Voting Age
ST. PAUL, Minn. — A constitutional amendment
lowering Minnesota's voting age to 19 apparently has
been approved by a margin of 6 ,209 votes.
If the figures are formally certified by the State
Canvassing Board next Tuesday it will mean that
19-year-olds can vote in Minnesota, regardless of the
outcome of a Supreme Court test on the federal law
reducing the voting age to 18.
Minnesota's minimum voting age has been 21.
Nudity Ruling Sought
WASHINGTON — Eight persons who were fined
$200 apiece for staging a naked demonstration
against commercialized sex are seeking a Supreme
Court ruling that it is not unlawfully lewd to be
publicly nude.
Freedom of speech means freedom to strip, they
contend.
The five women and three men, then students at
lowa's Grinnell College, disrobed before about 80
people at a sex education lecture February 5 , 1969.
They protested the presence of Brice Draber, a
representative of Playboy Magazine there to discuss
the "Playboy philosophy."
They shucked their garments, according to
their appeal, "in order to display the depth of their
opposition and to demonstrate they were not
opposed to nudity, per se, but to ihe commercial

exploitation of the human body and sexual
relationships . .
They carried placards and sang a song with a
religious theme. After about 10 minutes of the
nude-in they put their clothes back on.
The Grinnell 8 were convicted of violating an lowa
law against "open and gross lewdness," or indecent
exposure. They were fined the maximum $2 0 0 each.
Their appeal to the lowa Supreme Court was
turned down 5 to 3 with one abstention.
TV Violence In Court
WASHINGTON Accusing the Federal
Communications Commission and the networks of
dragging their feet, a private foundation launched a
court fight Thursday to bar fron TV before 9 p.m.
programs that depict violence.
A 146-page brief field in U.S. District Court by the
Foundation to Improve Television seeks to prove that
such programs "harm the mental health and
well-being" of young children and that such injury is
irreparable.
The foundation, formed two years ago, is using as
a test case an effort to halt reruns of "Wild Wild
West" in late afternoons six days a week over
Washington station WTOP.
It described the program as one based on the
exploits of two fictional undercover agents who in
each episode "encounter new adventures which
feature acts of fictionalized violence and brutality."
The court action was taken on behalf of three
suburban area mothers.
Desgregation Views Conflict
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration and the
National Education Association took sharply
divergent views Thursday as to the progress of school
desegregation in the South.
One high administration official said school
desegregation in the South is sufficiently complete to
shift government enforcement officers from that area
to the North.
But the NEA said a task force study of 70 school
districts in Mississippi and Louisiana "cast serious
doubt on the supposed progress made in deep South
school desegregation in the past year."

Nudity Ruling Sought
WASHINGTON — Eight persons who were fined
$200 apiece for staging a naked demonstration
against commercialized sex are seeking a Supreme
Court ruling that it is not unlawfully lewd to be
publicly nude.
Freedom of speech means freedom to strip, they
contend.
The five women and three men, then students at
lowa's Grinnell College, disrobed before about 80
people at a sex education lecture February 5 , 1969.
They protested the presence of Brice Draber, a
representative of Playboy Magazine there to discuss
the "Playboy philosophy."
They shucked their garments, according to
their appeal, "in order to display the depth of their
opposition and to demonstrate they were not
opposed to nudity, per se, but to ihe commercial

exploitation of the human body and sexual
relationships . .
They carried placards and sang a song with a
religious theme. After about 10 minutes of the
nude-in they put their clothes back on.
The Grinnell 8 were convicted of violating an lowa
law against "open and gross lewdness," or indecent
exposure. They were fined the maximum $2 0 0 each.
Their appeal to the lowa Supreme Court was
turned down 5 to 3 with one abstention.
TV Violence In Court
WASHINGTON Accusing the Federal
Communications Commission and the networks of
dragging their feet, a private foundation launched a
court fight Thursday to bar fron TV before 9 p.m.
programs that depict violence.
A 146-page brief field in U.S. District Court by the
Foundation to Improve Television seeks to prove that
such programs "harm the mental health and
well-being" of young children and that such injury is
irreparable.
The foundation, formed two years ago, is using as
a test case an effort to halt reruns of "Wild Wild
West" in late afternoons six days a week over
Washington station WTOP.
It described the program as one based on the
exploits of two fictional undercover agents who in
each episode "encounter new adventures which
feature acts of fictionalized violence and brutality."
The court action was taken on behalf of three
suburban area mothers.
Desgregation Views Conflict
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration and the
National Education Association took sharply
divergent views Thursday as to the progress of school
desegregation in the South.
One high administration official said school
desegregation in the South is sufficiently complete to
shift government enforcement officers from that area
to the North.
But the NEA said a task force study of 70 school
districts in Mississippi and Louisiana "cast serious
doubt on the supposed progress made in deep South
school desegregation in the past year."
Heyns To Resign?
LOS ANGELES — The resignation of Roger W.
Heyns, chancellor of the University of California at
Berkeley, may be announced Friday, the Los Angeles
Times reports.
The newspaper said Heyns has been losing favor
among conservative members of the University of
California Board or Regents.
A spokesman for Heyns said he could neither
confirm not deny the newspaper report. Heyns could
not be reached for comment.
Heyns suffered a mild heart attack last July, and
his health was thought to be a factor in his retirement
decision, the Times said.
A former vice president of academic affairs at the
University of Michigan, Heyns, 52, was installed as
chancellor of the Berkeley campus in 1955.
He succeeded Martin Meyerson, who served as
acting chancellor after the resignation of Edward W.
Strong following campus disruptions involving the
Berkeley free speech disorders in 1964.
The Times said Heyns had reached his decision to
retire several days ago and would announce it by the
end of this week.
UA W Contract

The United Auto Workers' 35 0-member GM
Council listened to union leaders explain the terms of
the tentative agreement for 5-1 /2 hours before
deciding by a 4-1 margin to recommend it to the

package," UAW President Leonard Woodcock told
the Council. "But there comes a point of time in the
battle when gains to be made have to be weighed

who are waging the front-line battle."
Contract provisions, withheld until Thursday's GM
council meeting, included:
—An average first-year wage increase of 51 cents
an hour, improved by 3 percent in each of the last
two years of the pact. The current average hourly
wage of a GM worker is $4 .02 .

—Restoration of unlimited cost-of-living
allowances under which wages are raised up or down

TV Violence In Court
WASHINGTON Accusing the Federal
Communications Commission and the networks of
dragging their feet, a private foundation launched a
court fight Thursday to bar fron TV before 9 p.m.
programs that depict violence.
A 146-page brief field in U.S. District Court by the
Foundation to Improve Television seeks to prove that
such programs "harm the mental health and
well-being" of young children and that such injury is
irreparable.
The foundation, formed two years ago, is using as
a test case an effort to halt reruns of "Wild Wild
West" in late afternoons six days a week over
Washington station WTOP.
It described the program as one based on the
exploits of two fictional undercover agents who in
each episode "encounter new adventures which
feature acts of fictionalized violence and brutality."
The court action was taken on behalf of three
suburban area mothers.
Desgregation Views Conflict
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration and the
National Education Association took sharply
divergent views Thursday as to the progress of school
desegregation in the South.
One high administration official said school
desegregation in the South is sufficiently complete to
shift government enforcement officers from that area
to the North.
But the NEA said a task force study of 70 school
districts in Mississippi and Louisiana "cast serious
doubt on the supposed progress made in deep South
school desegregation in the past year."
Heyns To Resign?
LOS ANGELES — The resignation of Roger W.
Heyns, chancellor of the University of California at
Berkeley, may be announced Friday, the Los Angeles
Times reports.
The newspaper said Heyns has been losing favor
among conservative members of the University of
California Board or Regents.
A spokesman for Heyns said he could neither
confirm not deny the newspaper report. Heyns could
not be reached for comment.
Heyns suffered a mild heart attack last July, and
his health was thought to be a factor in his retirement
decision, the Times said.
A former vice president of academic affairs at the
University of Michigan, Heyns, 52, was installed as
chancellor of the Berkeley campus in 1955.
He succeeded Martin Meyerson, who served as
acting chancellor after the resignation of Edward W.
Strong following campus disruptions involving the
Berkeley free speech disorders in 1964.
The Times said Heyns had reached his decision to
retire several days ago and would announce it by the
end of this week.
UA W Contract
DETROIT -- Representatives of 394,0 00 striking
General Motors workers approved Thursday a new
contract which one union executive said would raise
wages and fringe benefits by $1.80 an hour in three
years.
The United Auto Workers' 35 0-member GM
Council listened to union leaders explain the terms of
the tentative agreement for 5-1 /2 hours before
deciding by a 4-1 margin to recommend it to the
union's membership.
"I want to tell you I am not satisfied with this
package," UAW President Leonard Woodcock told
the Council. "But there comes a point of time in the
battle when gains to be made have to be weighed
against the hardships to be inflicted on the troops,
who are waging the front-line battle."
Contract provisions, withheld until Thursday's GM
council meeting, included:
—An average first-year wage increase of 51 cents
an hour, improved by 3 percent in each of the last
two years of the pact. The current average hourly
wage of a GM worker is $4 .02 .

—Restoration of unlimited cost-of-living
allowances under which wages are raised up or down
in accordance with changes in the Consumer Price
Index.
-Retirement at $5 00 a month after 30 years
service for persons age 58 in the second year of the
contract and at age 56 in the third year.
Bard Young, a regional director and executive
board member, estimated it would take at least a
week for local unions to complete their ratification
vote. And he said it might take considerably longer in
locals currently without at-the-plant settlements.
The local contracts, which supplement the
national agreement, remain unsettled at 68 of GM's
155 bargaining units in the United States. That figure
includes 18 of 2 4 assembly plants and 12 of 54
so-called key plants.
Minn. Lowers Voting Age
ST. PAUL, Minn. — A constitutional amendment
lowering Minnesota's voting age to 19 apparently has
been approved by a margin of 6 ,209 votes.
If the figures are formally certified by the State
Canvassing Board next Tuesday it will mean that
19-year-olds can vote in Minnesota, regardless of the
outcome of a Supreme Court test on the federal law
reducing the voting age to 18.
Minnesota's minimum voting age has been 21.
Nudity Ruling Sought
WASHINGTON — Eight persons who were fined
$200 apiece for staging a naked demonstration
against commercialized sex are seeking a Supreme
Court ruling that it is not unlawfully lewd to be
publicly nude.
Freedom of speech means freedom to strip, they
contend.
The five women and three men, then students at
lowa's Grinnell College, disrobed before about 80
people at a sex education lecture February 5 , 1969.
They protested the presence of Brice Draber, a
representative of Playboy Magazine there to discuss
the "Playboy philosophy."
They shucked their garments, according to
their appeal, "in order to display the depth of their
opposition and to demonstrate they were not
opposed to nudity, per se, but to ihe commercial

exploitation of the human body and sexual
relationships . .
They carried placards and sang a song with a
religious theme. After about 10 minutes of the
nude-in they put their clothes back on.
The Grinnell 8 were convicted of violating an lowa
law against "open and gross lewdness," or indecent
exposure. They were fined the maximum $2 0 0 each.
Their appeal to the lowa Supreme Court was
turned down 5 to 3 with one abstention.
