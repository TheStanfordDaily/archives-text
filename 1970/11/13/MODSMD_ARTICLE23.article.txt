# More Housing Planned
## 
### 
Construction of 2 32 units of
University student housing is scheduled
to start in February, according to
action taken by the board of trustees
earlier in the week.
The project, known as Escondido V,
is located on a 10.6 acre site at the
intersection of Campus Drive and
Escondido Road.
Trustees gave contractors and
developers a freer hand in meeting basic
requirements and the low bid, 3.6
million, is approximately 20 per cent
under comparable apartment
construction costs.
Instead of preparing a detailed set of
plans and then putting th«'m out to bid,
the University developed an extensive
informational package of basic program
requirements and let private industry
develop site plans, architectural and
engineering design, etc.
"We've gotten outstanding results at
substantially lower cost," said Ed

Scoles, University housing officer.
United Homes Corporation of Federal
Way (Seattle-Tacoma), Washington was
selected to build the complex from 1 7
private industry proposals.
In the past, Scoles notes, "fine,
highly detailed designs by the
University created inherent high costs
in construction." By encouraging a
combined design-construction effort
from the outset, the new method
enables contractors to realize
substantial savings by adopting their
own techniques to meet the broad
University requirements.
Both students and faculty were
involved in the evaluation of proposals,
as well as in the earlier work on basic
criteria for the project, according to
Scoles.
Before construction is started, final
approval is needed from the
Department of Housing and Urban
Development, which provides loan
funds for the construction.
