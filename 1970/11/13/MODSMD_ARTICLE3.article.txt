# Interim Plan Passed For Faculty Discipline
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
approved interim measures to insure
faculty self-discipline, while a detailed
report on the question is compiled.
The three-pronged resolution, passed
by voice vote without dissent, called
for the selection of a faculty committee
to hear those faculty cases which do
not fall under the jurisdiction of
existing campus tribunals. The Senate's
Committee on Committees (CoC) will
choose this group, subject to the
approval of the entire Senate.
In addition, the resolution expressed
the Senate's appreciation to the
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University professors
(AAUP), which has established a
Commission on Faculty Self-Discipline,
headed by law professor Herbert
Packer.
This group intends to complete its
study of the subject by early January.
The third prong of the Senate
resolution creates mechanisms to
receive this report and formulate
legislation.
Revenue Possibilities
During the lengthy meeting, William
Miller, vice-president for Research,
discussed briefly measures the
University has adopted to combat the
current fiscal crisis.
Miller explained that there are four
options open to the University to
increase its budget:

—Increase tuition
—Increase the revenue from gifts
—Recover more fully the indirect
costs to the University—costs such as
maintenance, administration, and
depreciation—in part by taking a larger
slice of research grants to recover
indirect costs
—Operate at a deficit.
Miller added that the University is
presently implementing all of these
procedures.
Grants Should Pay
Genetics professor Joshua Lederberg
explained to maintain orderly
management, that research grants
"should at least pay their own way."
In the case of some grants, the rise
in the rate of indirect costs, which the
University receives, will be offset by a
corresponding rise in the size of the
grant. In these cases, the funds
allocated directly for research will
remain stable.
However, in those cases where the
grant will not be increased, direct
funding for research projects will be cut
back to allow for the rise of indirect
costs.
The Senate also discussed a report
from the CoC containing ten
recommendations for various campus
bodies established to insure community
self-discipline (distinct from the earlier
resolution).
The Senate took no action regarding
the report as a whole, which will head
the agenda for their meeting next
Thursday.
