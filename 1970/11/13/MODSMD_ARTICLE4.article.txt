## Campus Labor Trys To Organize 
### PHIL LIND 
groups were dissappointed however,
upon hearing that the University would
not grant the half day off.
According to Robert Nelson,
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, workers are allowed to
organize on their own time but not
during working hours. "What workers
do on their own time is not under
University jurisdiction. This means that
breaks and lunch hours are accepted as
a worker's time and not as the
University's time."
Letter to the Daily
In Thursday's Daily appeared a letter
written by Nelson stating the
University's position concerning time
off for the meeting. "Concerning union
activities specifically, the University has
clearly and repeatedly stated that
organizing and informational activities
are not to interfere with regular
University operations and function, and
that policy is applicable in this
instance. On the other hand, we have
not attempted in any way to interfere
with union activities during
non-working times or in non-working
areas. We cannot, therefore, honor the
request for time off for such a
meeting."
In a KZSU interview Tuesday night
President Lyman indicated that the
University cannot pay workers when
they are not working. "The situation
between workers and faculty being
given time off is quite different because
of the nature of the jobs," Lyman said.
According to Devera Satisky,
chairman of the Workers Action
Caucus, the refusal was disappointing
"Because of the importance of the

Several campus labor groups have
recently been attempting to establish
themselves as the bargaining unit for
Stanford workers. As the National
Labor Relations Board (NLRB)
hearings continue, the groups have
organized an open meeting today at 1
p.m. in Cubberley Auditorium for all
campus workers.
The purpose of the meeting is to
allow workers to hear the different
bargaining units and what it is each
group would like to do. In order to
encourage that a large number of
workers show up, most of the
important business will take place in
the first hour of the meeting, allowing
workers to take a late lunch and attend
the meeting on their own time thus not
risking the loss of their jobs.
On Monday of this week, an open
letter to President Lyman appeared in
the Daily asking the University to
grant a half day off paid time to discuss
this crucial matter. The letter was
signed by the Teamsters, United
Stanford Employees, (USE), United
Electrical Workers, Workers Action
Caucus, and Stanford Employees
Association (SEA), SEA has since
withdrawn support and will not be
represented at the meeting today.
According to Roland Finston of
USE, "Each group will have about 10
minutes to describe to the workers its
basic platform, who each wishes to
represent, and what their demands may
b«>. After this, the meeting will be open
for questions from the audience."
Representatives from the labor

meeting I thought that the University
may grant the time off. Workers who
are isolated need the meeting to clear
their minds of confusing ideas."
Rick Stuart of the Workers Action
Caucus felt that the University was not
being fair to the workers. "The most
oppressed workers at Stanford are the
ones that need to learn about
organizing the most. They certainly
can't afford to attend a meeting if they
loose their pay and how can they be
expected to stay after work when many
of them have to commute 30 or 4 0
miles 1
Even though the University has
refused time off for the workers, the
meeting will take place as planned,
today at 1 :0 0.
All of the groups participating in
Friday's meeting have presented cases
to the NLRB hearings in San Francisco
as to which segments of Stanford
employees should be included in the
bargaining unit.
Wide Bargaining Unit
According to Finston, USE is asking
for the widest possible bargaining unit.
USE wishes the NLRB to recognize all
people who work for the University
directly and all people who work on
the campus but not directly for the
University. "This includes the
employees at the Stanford Hospital, the
Book Store, and the carpenters who are
employed by an outside company but
contracted by the University."
USE has a very wide base of support
from many different depaitments. "II
is perhaps the broadest support of any
of the labor groups," according to
Finston.

The Workers Action Caucus has a
five point platform for action at
Stanford:
—"Struggle against the
oppression of black, brown,
and all third world people.
—"The right to actively
express political belief."
—"Struggle against the
oppression of women."
—"Carry on the struggle
against U.S. Imperialism."
—"Struggle against inferior
living standards."
Devera Satisky of WAC said that as a
supposedly neutral body the NLRB has
"shown itself as an extension of the
same people who are causing the
problems that require us to organize
ourselves. The NLRB hearings
themselves are being carried on during
working hours and in San Francisco.
This makes it virtually impossible for
the average worker to attend. The
hearings are supposed to be for the
benefit of the workers but this is not
the case and SEA appears to be
favored. SEA represents only a very
small group of workers. If the NLRB
rules that their plan should be accepted
then the workers are not being treated
fairly."
Miss Satisky continued with a list of
the grievances against the University.
"Women in some departments doing
the same job and having the same title
as men are paid less than the men.
Many women and some men who work
have to pay for child care during the
day. The University should provide free
child care centers for all of its workers."
