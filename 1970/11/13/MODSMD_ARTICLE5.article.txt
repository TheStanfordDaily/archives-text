## Commissioner Responds To Charges 
### 
Chris banks

Over the past few weeks I have
been subjected to a ridiculously
high degree of accusations and
falsehoods concerning the ASSU
Senate elections, all of which
seem to germinate from one focal
point, the ARENA staff.
Einding it very difficult to sit
back and observe day after day
the journalistic incompetence
being displayed by certain
members of the ARENA staff, I
deem it my responsibility, not
only as Elections Commissioner,
but also as a Stanford student, to
inform the Associated Students of
the inability of the ARENA to
report in a manner fitting the
profession.
The ARENA has charged in its
November 6 statewide issue that
"the postponement of the first
(Senatorial election resulted in
substantial costs to the Student
Body and candidates." The
additional cost to the student
body totaled close to $100 which,
taken out of a budget amounting
to nearly $2,000, is not in my
opinion a substantial loss in trade
for a finer product.
As to the costs to the
candidates, the only regulating
powers I hold over the candidates
is that of limiting the amount of
money they can spend on their
campaign to $5 0. The personal
budgeting of each candidate Ls his
own matter, not regulated by my
actions.
The ARENA states further that
"the Commissioner failed to act
on campaign violations" and
"failed to set up adequate means
of registering complaints."
Because of constitutional
limitations the ASSU Elections

Commissioner is given no punitive
jurisdiction over campaign
violators, i.e. illegal electioneering,
nor is he required to form or
provided with a complaint board.
(May you note here that one
charge of illegal electioneering was
lodged against the ARENA who
had campaign material within ten
feet of the polls).
The article goes on to state
that the election results have been
unnecessarily delayed. Granted a
letter was returned marked
"insufficient postage" which
resulted in a loss of four days. The
causeâ€”a postal meter
misunderstanding between myself
and an ASSU secretary.
The ARENA even goes so far
as to include a degrading
statement supposedly quoted
from an ASSU office worker.
When approached individually
without my knowledge, each
office worker flatly denied
originating the statement, and
signed a petition to that effect.
The position of running
elections is always awarded its
share of problems, and I shed no
shadow on the fact that I've had
mine. Although I'm not
constitutionally bound, I
recognize the equitable basis for
an alphabetical order arrangement
of ballot candidates and because
of this I admit the mistake of an
incorrect placement. I also accept
the responsibility for the two
candidates receiving the same
numerical ranking. Both mistakes
escaped the eyes of Jan Westfall,
last year's Elections
Commissioner, and myself, and
was simply an error.
But to be the subject of attack

by a group which seems to thrive
on sensationalism,
unsubstantiated acclaims, and the
desire to gain attention for the
sole reason of gaining that
attention, all of this for a mere
$60 a year is not only ridiculous
but inexcusable.
It is not in response to the
foolish accusations asserted bv the

ARENA, nor is it an explanation
of mistakes for petty politicians
to feed on, but rather I submit to
the responsible memebers of our
community a factual accounting
of all irregularities and mistakes in
question, a commodity rarely
found in ARENA journalism.

Elections Commissioner)
