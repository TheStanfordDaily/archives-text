Employees
Editor, THE DAILY:
I was glad to see the "Open
Letter" in Monday's Daily
announcing a meeting for campus
workers to become informed,
about the National Labor
Relations Board hearings and the
unions who participated in the
hearings. I heard of several
incidents involving employees
which convince me that all
campus workers should be
interested in labor issues at
Stanford.
Judy King's case Is one
example of what can happen to a
blue-collar employee. She worked

in Tresidder and was fired for
getting signatures on a petiiton
stating that her service on the
canteen truck she drove was good
and that she was well liked by her
customers. (Her letter was in the
Daily last week.)
Another case is that of Sandy
Medina whose story was in
"Employees Organize," the paper
of United Stanford Employees.
She was told by her supervisor
that she had gotten flea bites not
from cleaning up a dorm lounge
that was infested but from
"chasing men in the bushes." She
had refused to clean up such a
dorm area after having been bitten
severlv when she cleaned a lounge
area previously.

I also know that many of the
i gardners in the physical plant
■ must hold two jobs in order to
I meet the current cost of living.
The University sheds many
i bitter tears about how the money
is running out. Yet I find that my
sympathies are much more with
i the workers rather than the Board
■ of Trustees and the
Administration. With all the
• pwoer and influence they have
. you'd think that somehow
■ Stanford workers would be better
i off. But too much like other big
■ businessmen, they prefer to keep
i a closer watch on their
i super-profits from the war
■ industries, large banks, and big
manufacturing companies on
whose boards they sit or
influence.
The working man and woman
must pay the bills for the power
that these big men are in
competition for, no matter who is
elected from which party to what
office. It seems to me that us
"little people" should begin to
think of better ways to regain
control over our own lives.

Clarification
Editor, THE DAILY:
I did not say "Fuck off" to the
local FBI agent investigating the
Nixon thing. I simply told him
that my client would not talk
with him unless he gave a full
explanation of the purpose of his
investigation, the possibility of
criminal charges, and the facts
whichled him to contact my
client.
James Wolpman
New Weapon
Editor, THE DAILY:
The recent issue of Chemical &
Engineering News reports the
development of what could be the
penultimate nonviolent weapon:
"The National Research Council
of Canada has developed a
pneumatic cannon that fires dead
checkens at speeds up to 620
mph."
.Just, think of the possible uses:
riot control devices,
skeetshooting, gourmet cooking,
football games, and antiaircraft
devices. Pity this valuable research
is being wasted on bird-aircraft
collisions.

Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is to correct the
misinformation in your Monday
issue that SEA joined with other
organizations to demand time (iff

for employees to attend a mass
meeting. SEA did not sign a letter
to President Lyman and gave no
one authority to use its name.
SEA does not engage in such
ridiculous grandstanding.
SEA publishes its own bulletins
to inform all employees of the
facts of the NLRB proceeding.
There is no point in a so-called
debate with persons having
neither legal nor practical
experience in union
representation who seek merely to
explit the names of those who do.
It will be months before a
NLRB election is held. Rousing
the emotions and hopes of
employees at this time does them
a disservice.
There are established NLRB
policies which will govern the
decision on appropriate bargaining
units. A mass meeting could have
absolutely no effect on that
decision. Similarly, there are
established policies prohibiting
racial or ethnic discriminations in
bargaining units. A mass meeting
could have no effect on those
policies.
It is obvious that left wing
political groups are masquerading
as unions. They are concerned
with disruption rather than an
effective organization to gain
material benefits for employees.
Their participation in the NLRB
proceeding has designedly
prolonged the hearing and
confused the issues. By those
means they have assisted the
University as an employer. They
have no chance to persuade the
NLRB to their positions, so they
and the University work together,
both trying to defeat a legitimate
organization interested in the
welfare of workers rather than
radical politics.
SEA is the only labor
organization with a practical plan
to set up proper bargaining units.
The first will include technical,
maintenance and service
personnel. Then the next step can
establish a unit of office and
clerical personnel. They may
amalgamate later, but there is no
other practical method now. All
attempts to short cut this
procedure will defeat the interests
of the employees and can serve no
one but the strange fellowship of
a conservative administration and
radical disrupters.
