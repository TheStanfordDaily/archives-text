# Pollster Analyzes November Election
## 
### 
President Nixon's San Jose
campaign appearance plus Senator
George Murphy's election eve
"anarchy" ad produced an
overexposure to the candidate
which ended up alienating more
voters than it attracted, declared
veteran pollster Mervin Field.
Speaking before an audience of
75 in the Art Auditorium
Wednesday night, Field said, "The
whole episode, including the
President's endorsement, was
counterproductive and turned
into a disastrous loss."
The pollster claimed that when
a candidate reaches a certain level
of exposure or a saturation point,
any further exposure does more
harm than good.
"As a result," he said, "Tunney
won by more than he should have.
Now we'll see a lot of foolishness
in the media linking Tunney with
the late John F. Kennedy."
"Blame it on Murphy," he

joked, "because Tunney did
better than he should have "
The controversial Murphy ad
implied that a vote for Tunney
was equaJ to "anarchy" while a
vote for the Republican candidate
was equivalent to "law and
order."
The Riles-Rafferty contest for
state superintendent of public
instruction was a classic-example
of the impact of unknown fÂ°ctors.
Field said. "I have never seen a
race turn around so much in 25
years of polling," he added.
Wilson Riles came from 25
points behind Rafferty to one
percent ahead between June and
November, Field reported. Riles
had more local support groups
throughout the state than any
other candidate. Even
Reagan-Murphy conservatives
swung over into the Riles' camp,
he said.
