# No Change Seen In SRI Research Policy
## 
### FRED MANN Second in a Series 
The facade of the visitor's entrance
is modern, made of glass and steel.
New, "ornamental" riot-control fences
have been installed around parts of the
whole complex. Over the main entrance
is the corporation emblem: the red
letters SRI covering a globe.
The Stanford Research Institute has
not appreciably changed over the last
two years. The organization has severed
all connections with the University, but
continues to thrive on basically the
same type of research that it always
has. The fences seem to indicate that
SRI is more prepared for any type of
demonstrations that might be staged
against it, yet it still proudly "covers
the globe" with' offices, laboratories,
and clients.
"We are a considerably stronger
organization today than we were two
years ago," said Rudolph K. Brunsvold,
vice president of plans and special
programs at SRI. The disruptions of

two years ago tended to "unify the
organization," he said. "No new
restrictions have been forced on any
one here."
SRI does contracted research for
numerous clients at home and around
the world. Critics of the institute are
quick to point out that SRI would
never consider contracts from China or
the National Liberation Front, but
governments friendly to the United
States have benefited from the work of
the scientists and technicians in Menlo
Park.
Everything from planning
commissions for studying pollution to
chemical and petroleum forecasting
programs are initiated at SRI.
Researchers have recently begun
investigating a new rapid transit vehicle
which could travel at speeds up to 30 0
miles an hour, and a computerized
information system for the U.S. House
of Representatives.
Yet the bulk of the SRI research is
still of the same variety that protesters

questioned two years ago. SRI will
make $63 million this year, up $3
million from a year ago, and two-thirds
of the work will be done for the
government. Of this government work,
two-thirds (or 45 percent of the total
earnings) is contracted by the
Department of Defense.
Two years ago, government work
(federal, state, and local) made up three
quarters of SRl's total research, and the
DOD was responsible for three quarters
of that.
Brunsvold termed the drop in DOD
and overall government contracts "a
significant change for us." He cited
defense department cutbacks in all
areas as the reason for the drop in SRI
work. "But we are not suffering," he
said. "There has been a shift in national
priorities, and we have compensated by
doing more non-military work."
Increases in contracts from such
federal departments as transportation
and health, education and welfare have
partially accounted for the rise in SRI
revenue.

"Even before the issue of defense
contracts came up," said Brunsvold,
"our highest priority research was in
such areas as transportation and the
environment. We have the largest
program of research in education in the
country."
Ronald I. Deutsch, SRl's manager of
media relations, added that the
institute followed government research
increases in such fields as cancer,
housing, and poverty.
Cover Up
Critics of SRI have acknowledged
the existence of studies in these areas,
but claim they are coverups for
counterinsurgency and other types of
research covering Southeast Asia and
the Middle East.
Brunsvold stated that
"counterinsurgency work" was an
inappropriate title, and that although
SRI did in fact do research for agencies
that deal in counterinsurgency, each
SRI division was an interdisciplinary

study, dealing with "a multitude of
different problems."
He further remarked that SRI
people are in Southeast Asia doing
work, but claimed less than one percent
of SRl's work dealt with the war in
that area.
Less Than One
Two years ago, Brunsvold said that
the SRI study dealing with chemical
warfare was "a one man effort." Today
he says it is "less than that number."
He added that the organization was
doing no chemical-biological warfare
research at all, and on the question of
crop defoliation and bomb route
cost-analysis said, "I doubt that we're
doing research in that field."
One third of SRl's defense
department contracts are said to be
"classified," and only 10 percent
eventually comes out with a "secret"
label. Such contracts, a major target of
critics in the past, continue to come to
the institute, which is now enjoying a
healthy financial year. Another reason
for the added prosperity of SRI may be
the institute's recent split from the
University.
"It's hard to say our increased
income is a result of the separation,"
remarked Brunsvold, "but autonomy
makes you able to conduct your affairs
more directly."
Non-Profit
By their founding charter with the
State of California, SRI is a non-profit
organization, meaning there is no stock.
Profits from research contracts go for
new laboratory equipment, buildings,
and training programs. According to
the separation agreement, the
corporation must also pay one percent
of its gross operating revenue each year
to the University until an indefinite
total of over $25 million has been paid.
"The money is simply to fulfill the
terms of our founding charter," said
Brunsvold. "We were established to
'advance the educational purposes of
Stanford University,' and this fact can't
be ignored. We changed this obligation
to a dollar figure."
Still, connections between SRI and
its original founder exist. Graduate
students and university faculty do work
at the institute and a few SRI
researchers continue to teach courses at
the University. SRI officials are quick
to point out, however, that Stanford
teachers and students work only on an
individual basis, and that there is no
special agreement between the school
and the corporation.

Within five years, SRI will also lose
the Stanford name. "Right now, we
have no new ideas for a name," said
Brunsvold, "but the switch won't make
any difference. We've been in existence
for 25 years, and we are as well known
in our own right."
Streamlining
The new autonomy and efficiency
has been coupled with a streamlining of
the board of trustees at SRI. The
governing group is being cut from 33
members to 15, and no University
trustees will be serving both institutes.
The new board chairman is E.
Hornsby Wasson, former board
chairman of Pacific Telephone and a
director of Standard Oil of California,
Bank of America, and the Prudential
Life Insurance Co. Vice chairmen are
Edgar F. Kaiser (chairman of the board
of Kaiser Industries Corp.), and
Edmund W. Littlefield (foimer
University trustee and president and
general manager of Utah Construction
and Mining).
Other SRI directors hold impressive
business credentials as well. R.G. Follis
is the former board chairman of
Standard Oil of California, D.J. Russell
is chairman of the Southern Pacific Co.,
and S.D. Bechtel is senior director of
Bechtel Corp.
Two years ago, one of the SDS'
rejected demands was that all SRI
directors make public all their
government and corporate connections.
No Big Changes
Radicals this year have found the
institute almost totally unchanged from
the time in early 1969 when sit-ins and
road blockings attempted to force a
switch in SRI administration and
research. Powerful business leaders still
run the organization although all
University trustees are gone. Defense
department research is off only because
total defense spending has dropped.
Classified contracts are still being
accepted and investigated for
pro-American clients.
The main difference is that SRI and
Stanford University are no longer tied,
and pressure on the university for
change in the institute no longer holds
weight. Or so it would seem.
Perhaps the new "riot-control"
fences will be useful to the corporation,
for radical students have promised "a
major offensive against SRI and others
sometime this year."

conflicting views.)
