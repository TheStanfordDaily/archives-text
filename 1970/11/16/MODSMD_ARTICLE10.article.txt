Flight Delay
Flights to the Overseas
Campuses of Germany and
England for winter quarter may
be delayed to allow students to
attend the Rose Bowl Game,
according to Pat Shea, member of
the Council of Presidents.
The flights were scheduled to
leave December 28 but
negotiations with Pan American
Airways will hopefully change the
departure date to January 4, said
Shea.
He received a telegram Friday
from Najeeb E. Halaby, president
of Pan Am and a University
trustee, indicating that the
departure might be rearranged.
Shea said that the University
should know definitely by
Wednesday when student tickets
to the Rose Bowl game will go on
sale.
Questionnaire Test
Faculty members in
Humanities and Sciences have
been asked to participate in a test
of the effectiveness of a new course
evaluation questionnaire developed
by the Comittee on the Student
Evaluation of Teaching.
In addition to being valuable to
instructors for the improvement
of their own teaching, evaluations
are bing considered as sources of
information for organizational
decisions, such as those dealing
with tenure, promotions, and
assignment to overseas campuses;

and as an aid to students in course
selection.
In pursuit of these objectives,
the committee has developed a
series of new questionnaires,
recognizing that useful
information must be carefully
gathered and accurately
interpreted. This quarter's
program is the latest and largest
test phase in the ongoing
development of the program.
The new questionnaire
provides for evaluation on a
number of precise points as well
as subjective essay responses and
seeks maximum flexibility. The
committee hopes that this
quarter's program will
demonstrate the advantages of
this more comprehensive
approach.
Course Review
Course Abstracts, the stepchild
of last year's ASSU Course
Review, is making its debut today.
A compilation of detailed course
descriptions turned in by the
instructors of undergraduate
courses being offered next
quarter, Course Abstracts provides
information on subject matter,
class format, booklists, and actual
requirements.
Copies of the course
descriptions will be distributed to
several libraries, including Meyer,
Engineering, Wilbur, Lagunita,
Branner, and Breer; the most
convenient reference center,
however, will be the Academic
Information Center on the third
floor of the Old Union.
