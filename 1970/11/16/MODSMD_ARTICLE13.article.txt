# A 						Hard Question To Answer
## 
### FRED LEESON 
COLORADO SPRINGS—So
Stanford got burned—perhaps
"frozen" would be more
accurate— 31-14 by Air Force.
What happened?
"I just can't tell you," said
offensive tackle Bill Meyers. "We
didn't play our game, offensively
or defensively. I really thought we
were ready."
"I don't want to commit
myself," said tackle Terrell Smith.
"I thought we did all right. We'll
just have to see the films."
"They were just getting yardage
somewhere," said defensive tackle
Bill Alexander. "I really can't
understand how they did it."
"They were just up more than
we were," said full back Jim Kehl.
Falcons Want It
"They were a better football
team this particular day," said
Coach John Ralston. "They
wanted it more than we did. Up
front in the trenches is where we
lost it."
None of the Indians, from
Ralston down, would accept the
2 8-degree temperature or the
25-30 mile-an-hour winds as
excuses.
What happened, then was Ernie
Jennings.
Jennings is the brilliant senior
flanker who caught 13 of Bob
Parker's 16 passes for 174 yards
and three touchdowns. Whenever
the Falcons needed help they
went to Jennings, like that fourth
and 12 play in the fourth quarter
on the Stanford 32.
Jennings made a diving catch
on the 13 to set up the Falcons'
third touchdown, which put the
Air Force ahead 24-14 with seven
minutes left and wrapped up the
game.
"Everything a receiver is

supposed to have he has with a
bonus," said defensive back
Charles McCloud, who spent the
afternoon with Jim Kauffman,
Jack Schultz and Benny Barnes
chasing Jennings.
"He just finds a way to get
open," Ralston said. "He's a super
player."
Little Help
Ralston said last week his team
had two goals left: finish in the
top five nationally and get Jim
Plunkett the Heisman trophy. The
second loss? "It can't help either
one," he said.
But this wasn't like the earlier
loss to Purdue when seemingly
everything went wrong.
The offense cranked 343 yards,
fumbled just once (that on a
broken play) and allowed no
interceptions.
Fullback Hillary Shockley,
running on a knee that is
supposed to have stretched
ligaments, slammed for 112 yards
in 28 carries and scored both
Tribe touchdowns, from one and
three yards out.
Quaterback Plunkett threw as
sharply as he did a week ago and
completed 17 of 35 passes for 18 2
yards. Three of his offerings—one
in the endzone—were dropped.
He also ran for 5 0 some yards
(most coming on a play devised at
halftime in which he dropped
back three steps, then galloped
straight ahead) but finished with a
total of 17 after losses were
subtracted for the times he got
dumped trying to throw.
Stanford's only injury during
the game came to Jack Lasater
who badly sprained his right
ankle. With alternate split end
Demea Washington not even
making the trip because of an
injury, Ralston replaced Lasater

with Eric Cross who caught seven
passes for 60 yards.
Stanford's trouble was in
keeping drives going. After the
scoring treks of 73 and 8 0 yards
in the first half, the Tribe's
longest drive was 4 3 yards, and
that one ran out of downs with 15
seconds left and the game far
gone.

So all Ralston could point to
was a game that was apparently
lost at the lines.
Somehow the Thunder
Chickens were't thundering and
the Holding Company—the
nickname for the offensive
line—wasn't holding.
"This is too good a team to
play like that," Ralston told his

players.
On the plane back he said,
"These guys have a lot of pride.
This could be a tonic for us. 1
always look on the bright side. We
seem to work harder after a loss."
It seemed like a hard, cold way
to get ready for California next
week, but maybe it will be the
surest.

Jennings, who caught 13 of the
Falcons' 16 passes, scored three
touchdowns and accounted for
176 yards, takes a pass (above,

Stanford defenders, including Jim
Kauffman (23). The Indians, who
had their five-game winning streak
snapped and their record dropped
to 8-2, spent much of the long
afternoon trying to keep
warm -like Eric Cross (40) who
straddles one of four heaters
which just couldn't heat up the
Tribe.

bonus," said defensive back
Charles McCloud, who spent the
afternoon with Jim Kauffman,
Jack Schultz and Benny Barnes
chasing Jennings.
"He just finds a way to get
open," Ralston said. "He's a super
player."
Little Help
Ralston said last week his team
had two goals left: finish in the
top five nationally and get Jim
Plunkett the Heisman trophy. The
second loss? "It can't help either
one," he said.
But this wasn't like the earlier
loss to Purdue when seemingly
everything went wrong.
The offense cranked 343 yards,
fumbled just once (that on a
broken play) and allowed no
interceptions.
Fullback Hillary Shockley,
running on a knee that is
supposed to have stretched
ligaments, slammed for 112 yards
in 28 carries and scored both
Tribe touchdowns, from one and
three yards out.
Quaterback Plunkett threw as
sharply as he did a week ago and
completed 17 of 35 passes for 18 2
yards. Three of his offerings—one
in the endzone—were dropped.
He also ran for 5 0 some yards
(most coming on a play devised at
halftime in which he dropped
back three steps, then galloped
straight ahead) but finished with a
total of 17 after losses were
subtracted for the times he got
dumped trying to throw.
Stanford's only injury during
the game came to Jack Lasater
who badly sprained his right
ankle. With alternate split end
Demea Washington not even
making the trip because of an
injury, Ralston replaced Lasater

with Eric Cross who caught seven
passes for 60 yards.
Stanford's trouble was in
keeping drives going. After the
scoring treks of 73 and 8 0 yards
in the first half, the Tribe's
longest drive was 4 3 yards, and
that one ran out of downs with 15
seconds left and the game far
gone.

So all Ralston could point to
was a game that was apparently
lost at the lines.
Somehow the Thunder
Chickens were't thundering and
the Holding Company—the
nickname for the offensive
line—wasn't holding.
"This is too good a team to
play like that," Ralston told his

players.
On the plane back he said,
"These guys have a lot of pride.
This could be a tonic for us. 1
always look on the bright side. We
seem to work harder after a loss."
It seemed like a hard, cold way
to get ready for California next
week, but maybe it will be the
surest.

Jennings, who caught 13 of the
Falcons' 16 passes, scored three
touchdowns and accounted for
176 yards, takes a pass (above,
right) and threads his way among
Stanford defenders, including Jim
Kauffman (23). The Indians, who
had their five-game winning streak
snapped and their record dropped
to 8-2, spent much of the long
afternoon trying to keep
warm -like Eric Cross (40) who
straddles one of four heaters
which just couldn't heat up the
Tribe.
COLORADO SPRINGS—So
Stanford got burned—perhaps
"frozen" would be more
accurate— 31-14 by Air Force.
What happened?
"I just can't tell you," said
offensive tackle Bill Meyers. "We
didn't play our game, offensively
or defensively. I really thought we
were ready."
"I don't want to commit
myself," said tackle Terrell Smith.
"I thought we did all right. We'll
just have to see the films."
"They were just getting yardage
somewhere," said defensive tackle
Bill Alexander. "I really can't
understand how they did it."
"They were just up more than
we were," said full back Jim Kehl.
Falcons Want It
"They were a better football
team this particular day," said
Coach John Ralston. "They
wanted it more than we did. Up
front in the trenches is where we
lost it."
None of the Indians, from
Ralston down, would accept the
2 8-degree temperature or the
25-30 mile-an-hour winds as
excuses.
What happened, then was Ernie
Jennings.
Jennings is the brilliant senior
flanker who caught 13 of Bob
Parker's 16 passes for 174 yards
and three touchdowns. Whenever
the Falcons needed help they
went to Jennings, like that fourth
and 12 play in the fourth quarter
on the Stanford 32.
Jennings made a diving catch
on the 13 to set up the Falcons'
third touchdown, which put the
Air Force ahead 24-14 with seven
minutes left and wrapped up the
game.

keeping drives going. After the
scoring treks of 73 and 8 0 yards
in the first half, the Tribe's
longest drive was 4 3 yards, and
that one ran out of downs with 15
seconds left and the game far
gone.

So all Ralston could point to
was a game that was apparently
lost at the lines.
Somehow the Thunder
Chickens were't thundering and
the Holding Company—the
nickname for the offensive
line—wasn't holding.
"This is too good a team to
play like that," Ralston told his

players.
On the plane back he said,
"These guys have a lot of pride.
This could be a tonic for us. 1
always look on the bright side. We
seem to work harder after a loss."
It seemed like a hard, cold way
to get ready for California next
week, but maybe it will be the
surest.

HOT AND COLD: Flanker Emie
Jennings, who caught 13 of the
Falcons' 16 passes, scored three
touchdowns and accounted for
176 yards, takes a pass (above,
right) and threads his way among
Stanford defenders, including Jim
Kauffman (23). The Indians, who
had their five-game winning streak
snapped and their record dropped
to 8-2, spent much of the long
afternoon trying to keep
warm -like Eric Cross (40) who
straddles one of four heaters
which just couldn't heat up the
Tribe.
COLORADO SPRINGS—So
Stanford got burned—perhaps
"frozen" would be more
accurate— 31-14 by Air Force.
What happened?
"I just can't tell you," said
offensive tackle Bill Meyers. "We
didn't play our game, offensively
or defensively. I really thought we
were ready."
"I don't want to commit
myself," said tackle Terrell Smith.
"I thought we did all right. We'll
just have to see the films."
"They were just getting yardage
somewhere," said defensive tackle
Bill Alexander. "I really can't
understand how they did it."
"They were just up more than
we were," said full back Jim Kehl.
Falcons Want It
"They were a better football
team this particular day," said
Coach John Ralston. "They
wanted it more than we did. Up
front in the trenches is where we
lost it."
None of the Indians, from
Ralston down, would accept the
2 8-degree temperature or the
25-30 mile-an-hour winds as
excuses.
What happened, then was Ernie
Jennings.
Jennings is the brilliant senior
flanker who caught 13 of Bob
Parker's 16 passes for 174 yards
and three touchdowns. Whenever
the Falcons needed help they
went to Jennings, like that fourth
and 12 play in the fourth quarter
on the Stanford 32.
Jennings made a diving catch
on the 13 to set up the Falcons'
third touchdown, which put the
Air Force ahead 24-14 with seven
minutes left and wrapped up the
game.
"Everything a receiver is

supposed to have he has with a
bonus," said defensive back
Charles McCloud, who spent the
afternoon with Jim Kauffman,
Jack Schultz and Benny Barnes
chasing Jennings.
"He just finds a way to get
open," Ralston said. "He's a super
player."
Little Help
Ralston said last week his team
had two goals left: finish in the
top five nationally and get Jim
Plunkett the Heisman trophy. The
second loss? "It can't help either
one," he said.
But this wasn't like the earlier
loss to Purdue when seemingly
everything went wrong.
The offense cranked 343 yards,
fumbled just once (that on a
broken play) and allowed no
interceptions.
Fullback Hillary Shockley,
running on a knee that is
supposed to have stretched
ligaments, slammed for 112 yards
in 28 carries and scored both
Tribe touchdowns, from one and
three yards out.
Quaterback Plunkett threw as
sharply as he did a week ago and
completed 17 of 35 passes for 18 2
yards. Three of his offerings—one
in the endzone—were dropped.
He also ran for 5 0 some yards
(most coming on a play devised at
halftime in which he dropped
back three steps, then galloped
straight ahead) but finished with a
total of 17 after losses were
subtracted for the times he got
dumped trying to throw.
Stanford's only injury during
the game came to Jack Lasater
who badly sprained his right
ankle. With alternate split end
Demea Washington not even
making the trip because of an
injury, Ralston replaced Lasater

with Eric Cross who caught seven
passes for 60 yards.
Stanford's trouble was in
keeping drives going. After the
scoring treks of 73 and 8 0 yards
in the first half, the Tribe's
