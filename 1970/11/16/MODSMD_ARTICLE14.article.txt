# The 						Playpen
## Winter At The Academy 
### Fred Leeson 
Smack to the west, the Rockies
rocket into the storm clouds and
the steady wind swirls the snow
flurries among the pine.
Below sits the Air Force
Academy, perched, for the most
part, on a gigantic, monumental
concrete slab, leaving no question
what is nature's and what is
man's.
The mammoth main
quadrangle is brought to you by
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill,
paragons of modern design. Layer
on layer, the same glass
curtain-wall is broken at the same
intervals by the same
aluminum-encased girders.
"No visitors permitted without
authorization," say the signs on
the doors. "Keep doors locked in
high winds."
Icicles hang from the lowest
girders, dripping to the
unwalked-walkways below, where
the wind and cold freeze the
water in ripples. Inviting outdoor
stairways lead into snowbanks,
with only cement walls beyond.
Then there's the huge cement
ramp which resembles a spillway
of a dam more than a pedestrian
passage. "Bring me men," say the
aluminum letters above. "No
visitors beyond this point," says
the sign below.
Only the chapel of dramatic
swept-wing design and the superb
interior play of daylight through
the colored glass between the
aluminum panels brings color to
the central campus.
Otherwise the snow blends
coldly with the marble, stone,
aluminum and glass, and the
Academy stands on its huge
platform as defiant as the
weather.
The cadets, in their uniformly
thick woolen jackets with pointed
hoods, walk across the vast plaza
with its mounted jet plane, heads
down against the storm.

"Hi," say those with "USAFA
72" on their coats. "Good
afternoon," say those of 73. "Can
I help you find something," say
those of 74.
Tires spin in the parking lot
and combat boots are enlisted by
those riding out stuck vehicles.
On a school day in winter a visitor
doesn't even need a thumb to get
a ride; drivers stop and volunteer a
lift.

On bus to practice at Falcon
Stadium Friday, Jackie Brown
looked out the window and let in
the wold wind.
"Hey coach," he said, "we'll
play the football game, then have
Christmas."
But somehow it is difficult to
imagine Christmas—whether your
imagination conjures Christ or
Santa Claus—at the calculatedly
austere Air Force Academy.

But somehow it is difficult to
imagine Christmas—whether your
imagination conjures Christ or
Santa Claus—at the calculatedly
austere Air Force Academy.
Smack to the west, the Rockies
rocket into the storm clouds and
the steady wind swirls the snow
flurries among the pine.
Below sits the Air Force
Academy, perched, for the most
part, on a gigantic, monumental
concrete slab, leaving no question
what is nature's and what is
man's.
The mammoth main
quadrangle is brought to you by
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill,
paragons of modern design. Layer
on layer, the same glass
curtain-wall is broken at the same
intervals by the same
aluminum-encased girders.
"No visitors permitted without
authorization," say the signs on
the doors. "Keep doors locked in
high winds."
Icicles hang from the lowest
girders, dripping to the
unwalked-walkways below, where
the wind and cold freeze the
water in ripples. Inviting outdoor
stairways lead into snowbanks,
with only cement walls beyond.
Then there's the huge cement
ramp which resembles a spillway
of a dam more than a pedestrian
passage. "Bring me men," say the
aluminum letters above. "No
visitors beyond this point," says
the sign below.
Only the chapel of dramatic
swept-wing design and the superb
interior play of daylight through
the colored glass between the
aluminum panels brings color to
the central campus.
Otherwise the snow blends
coldly with the marble, stone,
aluminum and glass, and the
Academy stands on its huge
platform as defiant as the
weather.
The cadets, in their uniformly
thick woolen jackets with pointed
hoods, walk across the vast plaza
with its mounted jet plane, heads
down against the storm.

"Hi," say those with "USAFA
72" on their coats. "Good
afternoon," say those of 73. "Can
I help you find something," say
those of 74.
Tires spin in the parking lot
and combat boots are enlisted by
those riding out stuck vehicles.
On a school day in winter a visitor
doesn't even need a thumb to get
a ride; drivers stop and volunteer a
lift.

On bus to practice at Falcon
Stadium Friday, Jackie Brown
looked out the window and let in
the wold wind.
"Hey coach," he said, "we'll
play the football game, then have
Christmas."
But somehow it is difficult to
imagine Christmas—whether your
imagination conjures Christ or
Santa Claus—at the calculatedly
austere Air Force Academy.
