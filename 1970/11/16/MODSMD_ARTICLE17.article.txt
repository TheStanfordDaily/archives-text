Plane Crash Kills 75
KENOVA, W. Va. — A brush with tree tops on a high
ridge rising in front of a rainy airport runway was
blamed Sunday for sending Marshall University's
chartered football jetliner cartwheeling into a hillside,
killing all 75 persons aboard.
"If it hadn't been for those trees, he would have
probably made it. It was that close," said John H.
Reed, chairman of the National Transportation
Safety Board.
Reed and federal investigators combed the
backwoods area eight miles west of Huntington for
clues Sunday, while firemen finished the task of
carrying charred bodies from the twisted, burnt
wreckage of the plane that carried Marshall's
hard-luck football team, its coaching staff, boosters
and others.
The disaster was the second in less than two
months to cut down a college football team. But
investigators found no similarity with the 31-death
Wichita State crash in the Rocky Mountains east of
Denver October 2, which killed 14 players.
Laird Blasted
TOKYO — North Vietnam said Sunday it has a
legitimate right to shoot down any U.S. plane that
flies over its territory and that U.S. Defense Secretary
Melvin R. Laird's statement about possible retaliation
has not frightened the North Vietnamese.
Laird issued a statement Friday after North
Vietnam shot down an unarmed RF-4 reconnaissance
plane 105 miles north of the demilitarized zone,
presumably killing its two crewmen. He said the
United States might retaliate if there are further
attacks on unarmed U.S. reconnaissance planes by the
North Vietnamese.
Reacting to Laird's remark, the North Vietnamese
military daily, "Quan Doi Nhan Dan," commented:
"Mr. Laird's language cannot frighten the Vietnamese
people in any way.
Pakistani Cyclone
DACCA, East Pakistan — Government officials,
struggling to set up relief operations in sodden East
Pakistan, said Sunday that a cyclone and tidal waves
may have claimed 300,000 lives.

Estimates of the death toll from Friday's storm
grew hourly as reports filtered in from Hooded
coastal districts bordering the Bay of Bengal and
offshore islands.
Officials attributed the high death toll to an
increase in the population of the low-lying area
because of the rice harvest and a lack of sufficient
warning before the storm hit.
Four islands in the Ganges river Delta 60 miles
south of Decca were the hardest hit. Various
government sources reported there appeared to be
virtually no survivors on one of the four islands that
had a total population of 1.4 million according to the
1961 census.
Grand Jury To Meet
SAN JOSE — Another meeting will be needed before
a grand jury subcommittee decides whether to
recommend investigating violence at President
Nixon's visit October 29, the subcommittee chairman
said Sunday.
Leonard W. Winston said he and the two other
members considered Saturday a police report
answering 25 questions and that another session is
likely Tuesday. He said he hopes a recommendation
can be made then to the full Santa Clara County
Grand Jury at a meeting he would like held Thursday
or Friday.
"We're trying to get an overview of the total
event," Winston said. "There were wildly conflicting
stories out of the news media and we're trying to get
the true facts."
Some accounts said the President's car was struck
by rocks but others said only a few motorcade bus
windows were hit.
'Lame Duck 9 Congress
WASHINGTON — Congress begins its first lame-duck
session in 20 years Monday with much of the
thorniest legislation saved for last.
Birth control, President Nixon's plan to overhaul
the nation's welfare system, and a host of other
legislation including some $110 billion worth of
appropriations are crammed into the short session
that is supposed to end before Christmas.
