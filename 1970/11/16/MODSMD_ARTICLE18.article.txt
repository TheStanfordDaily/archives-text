# McGuire May Lose Probation
## 
### 
A controversial Daily article written
by a former student may cost him his
probation.
Diarmund McGuire, a former
graduate student in communications
and member of the Revolutionary
Union, has been ordered to appear in
Palo Alto-Mountain View Municipal
Court at 2 p.m., December 4 for a
probation hearing.
Deputy District Attorney Roger
Bourke is seeking to revoke McGuire's
probation on the grounds that his
article attempts to incite an assault and
is criminally libelous. "It is an obvious
attempt to intimidate witnesses from
testifying at future trials," Bourke
stated.
The article, which appeared in the
October 2 issue of the Daily, called two
students who identified him at his trial,
"snitches" (informers) and urged others
to "take care of snitches." McGuire

wrote that snitches in prison are beaten
until they have "the consistency of
chocolate pudding."
McGuire was convicted last July of
breaking glass during campus
disturbances that followed the U.S.
invasion of Cambodia. His sentence was
30 days in county jail and three year's
probation on the basis he would break
no laws during the period. If probation
were revoked, McGuire could be sent
back to jail for up to 11 months.
McGuire said yesterday, "This is a
clear attempt to use probation as a tool
for political repression." He feels that
his three years probation, which he
claims is "a very long period for a
misdemeanor," is being used "as a
veiled threat" to keep him out of
politics.
He also claimed that the "pressure
for this move against me comes from
Stanford. I personally believe it came
from Richard Lyman."

University President Richard Lyman
called (his claim "a total fabrication of
his (McGuire's) imagination. I had
nothing to do with it." He also
indicated that he did not know
anything about the attempt to revoke
the probation until last night.
Bourke said that he feels the Daily
and its editors are equally culpable for
the article.
After the publication of the story, a
majority of the editorial staff declared
in the paper that the names of the
alleged "snitches" should not have been
printed as it could be construed that
violence was encouraged by McGuire.
The editors maintained, however, that
they were not wrong in printing the
article.
A retraction of certain parts of the
McGuire column appears today on the
opinion page.
