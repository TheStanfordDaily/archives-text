# Low Turnout Mars Labor Meeting
## 
### PHIL LIND 
Fifty workers attended a meeting of
labor groups on Friday in Cubberly
Auditorium, a turnout that was
disappointing after the week long
debate about the meeting. The debate
centered around whether or not
workers should be given a half-day paid
time off.
The organizing groups represented
were United Stanford Employees
(USE), Workers Action Caucus (WAC),
United Electrical workers (UE), and the
Teamsters. Stanford Employees
Association (SEA) was scheduled to
have a representative at the meeting,
but pulled out believing that other
groups would spend a great deal of time
attacking them.
The forum began with moderator
Miriam Cherry, member of the
Stanford Community Against War and

Fascism, who presented a brief
explanation of why the groups felt it
was necessary to organize workers.
Jim Berk, representing USE, opened
the discussion with a description of his
labor group. "In the last year and a half
USE has exposed many of the unfair
labor practices that the University
perpetrated on workers and made a few
gains as far as wages, low cost housing,
and hiring and firing policies."
Devera Satisky, representing WAC,
spoke on the subject of unfair
treatment of women. "Women are
among the lowest paid workers and are
given the most menial clerical work.
The supervisors in many departments
intimidate the women under them and
cause a great deal of friction between
women in one office."
Representing the UE was Doris
Youdelman. UE apparently is trying to

organize on the industrial park in the
hopes of preventing more workers from
being laid off.
The Teamsters union is attempting
to organize only the Physical Plant. Its
representative explained that it would
be "too big a job to organize the entire
campus."
After the opening statements of
each of the Labor groups the meeting
was opened up to audience discussion.
The first discussion centered around
the Teamsters' bid for a small
bargaining unit.
A man in the audience implied that
organizing only a small unit would
eventually lead to a split among the
workers.
Defending his position, the
Teamsters' representative said that the
Teamster position would provide
incentive for the rest of the workers to
organize.
