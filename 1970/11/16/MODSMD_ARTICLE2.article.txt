# Administration Moves To Bypass Coyote Hill Subdivision Deadlock
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
In a move apparently designed to
bypass a pending lawsuit, the
University applied Friday to the Palo
Alto City Council for ratification of a
contested subdivision for the Coyote
Hill area of the Stanford Industrial
Park.
The action asks the council to give
its approval of the subdivision which
has been blocked for almost a year by a
lawsuit filed by the Committee for
Green Foothills.
The lawsuit is based on two
criterion: alleged improper procedures
by the University and city staff in
approving a four-lot land division, and
alleged conflict of interest on the part
of two City Council members who
voted for the subdivision.

- The original action was approved by
a vote of 5 to 4. If the two council
members involved—Mayor Jack
Wheatley, a contractor in the area, and
Frank Gallagher, a Stanford
administrator—had not been allowed to
vote for the motion, it would not have
passed. Now however, according to the
Palo Alto Times, "there have been
some hints that other votes may have
shifted."
Lawsuit Moot
University mamager of real estate,
Boyd Smith said that the effect of the
council ratification would be to make
the lawsuit "moot." He said, "There
may be some additional legal
manipulations the plaintives can make
but basically we feel that if it is
ratified—l'm not an attorney—but to

my understanding it pretty well
destroys the substance of their conflict
of interest point."
"No necessarily so," says James
Danaher, attorney for the group. "On
the first part, the illegal procedures, we
have that on appeal, and the
ratification would only apply to the
conflict of interest issue. To a certain
extent, we think that they are asking
the councilmen to cover up for the
conflict of interest people. It's
interfering with the judicial process.
"We think that there is a very
substantial question whether the
ratification will do what the city wants
it to do. That is render the lawsuit
'moot.' What they are doing effectively
is to ask the council to back up—to
cover up—for the conflict of interest so
that maybe the facts won't get out to
the public."
Industrial Park Development
At issue is an area of approximately
100 acres of open land adjacent to the
industrial park which the University has
planned to develop. Last spring, when
the lawsuit was initiated, the board of
trustees had already approved leases for
several firms. Since then all of the
prospective tenants have gone
elsewhere, and according to Smith,
"The university has already lost
$1 ,300,000 in pre-paid leases."
The university also claims that a golf
course planned for the north side of
Coyote Hill will be held up until the
lawsuit is settled. According to George
Norton, President of The Committee
for a Green Foothills, "We do not
oppose the golf course. All they have to
do is go to the city and have the golf
course approved and they can go ahead
with it."
But Smith says, "Of course, we can't
build the golf course until the lawsuit is
removed. We stand a real good chance
of losing the course if we can't proceed.
People can't wait around forever you
know. They've been waiting almost a
year."

The action also indicats an end to
what Norton terms, "negotiations to
try and maintain a gateway to the
foothills and to maintain open space
between Coyote Hill and Page Mill
Road." According to Danaher, "There
have been some discussions to see
whether or not there is a compromise
from everyone's point of view out
there. What we're interested in is saving
as much of that hill as possible."
Smith says that the new move is
entirely consistent with past actions. "I
wouldn't say that we've had
negotiations. We met with them once
officially a couple of weeks ago. We
were hopeful at that time that they
would drop the lawsuit. We haven't
really felt like we've had anything- to
negotiate; we've never tried to bargain
with them."
If the action is ratified, Smith does
not think the University will have any
trouble in finding tenants for the area.
"We're in quite a different market than
we were in a year ago, but .. . it's a
very good development and I don't
think we'll have any trouble in the long
run. In the short run, of course, we've
lost."
