# University To Form Larger Police Force
## 
### 
More than $200,000 will be spent
this year in order to tighten security on
campus, Bruce Wiggins, University
director of public safety, said
Thursday.
Over $100,000 of the sum will be
used to increase police manpower on
walking beats around the campus.
University trustees allocated the money
last month to stem the increase in
burglary, theft, and vandalism, and to
prepare for the possibility of campus
unrest.
The remaining funds will be shared
between the fire department and
emergency communications
department of the University, Wiggins
said.
Wiggins added that the number of
new men on the police force will be
decided in a month by business
personnel and other security officials.

"I don't want to minimize the
problems of extremism and violence,"
Wiggins said, "but we are confronted
with an everyday increase in crimes like
theft and burglary."
"The very nature of a university
makes it an easy mark as a free and
open place where people's comings and
goings are not questioned," Wiggins
continued.
Commenting on the increasing crime
rate, Wiggins said the population
growth and crowding are primary
causes. The University has already
spent $300,000 this year on lighting
around campus.
"When I came to Stanford, someone
could leave a wallet on a window sill on
Friday and return to find it itact on
Monday," said Wiggins, former fire
marshall of Santa Clara county.
