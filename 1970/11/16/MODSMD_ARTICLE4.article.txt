Big Game opened with a crash eariy
this morning as what appeared to be
some Berkeley students broke the glass
case containing the Stanford Axe.
However, the Axe was not stolen.
The fast-moving maurauders also
attempted to spread the Cal colors on
campus, but their efforts were cut short
by a crew of highly-mobile Band
members.
At last report, seven persons were
being transported to the Stanford
Police Department for questioning.
Band members speculated that
punishment for the raiders would be to
clean up the paint and toilet tissue that
they had imported.
