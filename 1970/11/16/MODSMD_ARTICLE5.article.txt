# Army Continues To Store Germ Weapons

WASHINGTON — Despite a presidential
renunciation of biological warfare nearly 10
months ago, the United States is still
maintaining a vast stockpile of lethal biological
agents.
Approximately 10,000 gallons of some of the
most deadly killers known to man—including the
dreaded disease Anthrax—are now stored at the
Army's biological production center at Pine
Bluff, Ark.
President Nixon announced November 25,
1969, that the United States would get out of
the biological warfare field, except for a small
program of defensive research. At a briefing on
the matter on February 14,1970, at the Florida
White House, a high White House official assured
newsmen that the biological agents and weapons
were "in the process of being destroyed."
Yet it can now be reported that four
biological warfare agents are currently in the
U.S. stockpile. The agents and their military
codenames are: Tularemia, known as TT in its
wet storage form and ZZ in its dry, cold storage
form; Q Fever, called MN in its wet form and
NT when dry-stored; Anthrax known as TR-2 in
dry storage form and Venezuelan Equine
Encephalitis, known as TI).
The existence of the agents and their
codenames is still regarded as classified

information by the Pentagon, although President
Nixon has specifically renounced their use, even
in retaliation.
Sophisticated Warfare
In addition, the military has developed a
dozen sophisticated biological warfare spray
tanks, bombs, and other delivery systems
capable of disseminating dry or wet biological
agents from most of the attack planes now in
the U.S. arsenal. Special bombs for use or the
huge B-5 2 bombers even have been devised. The
development, testing, and procurement of the
delivery systems was conducted in strict secrecy.
The continued existence of the large
stockpiles and delivery' systems underlies the
contradictions and inconsistencies among
various Administration agencies as the
government seeks to implement the Presidential
declaration.
For example, public health officials
announced in June that they were "fully
satisfied" with an Army plan to dispose of the
biological materials at Pine Bluff by rendering
them harmless and spreading them about the
base. An earlier Army plan to sterilize the agents
and dump them into the Arkansas River had
been vetoed.
No Chance
Boris Osheroff, special assistant to the

surgeon general, told a newsman in June that
"There is absolutely no chance of living
organisms coming through intact" after the
Army disposal. Yet no disposal has been made.
Osheroff now refuses to talk, and other public
health service officials will only say that the
dumping plan is still under review.
Both the biological production facility at
Pine Bluff, a super-secret area valued at more
than $100 million, and the biological research
facility at Fort Detrick, Md., the Army's main
biological center, are scheduled to be turned
over to the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare for medical and other non-military
research. The Pentagon initially scheduled such
an announcement last June. 19, but abruptly
canceled a news briefing on the matter when,
according to officials, the White House lodged
an objection.
There has been no further official word since
then, although some jobs at Pine Bluff and Fort
Detrick are scheduled to be cut back.
More Money
Despite the cutbacks, the Army's 1971
budget request for biological warfare research
was $23.2 million, about $1.3 million more than
was appropriated for such work in the current
fiscal year. Overall, in fact, the Army's research
and development program for next year will be

$74.9 million, more than $3 million higher than
the current budget.
Another contradictory area involves defensive
biological research. White House officials have
repeatedly emphasized that the defensive
research authorized by the President last
November would be limited to immunization
and other protective measures. At the Florida
news briefing last February, the White House
specifically said "there will be no need for secret
research in this field under this program."
Yet many administration sources
acknowledged in interviews that at least one
major classified program involving biological
warfare research will continue at the Army's
main test center in Dugway, Utah, site of the
errant nerve gas test in March, 1968, that killed
6,000 sheep. As many as 250 civilian scientists
from Pine Bluff and Fort Detrick will be
transferred, or are in the process of doing so, to
the Utah base to continue the biological
program.
Defensive Measure
A Pentagon official, asked about the report,
said the programs at the Dugway Proving
Grounds were defensive in nature and would not
need to be classified.
A major argument offered by the military for
the classified program at Dugway involves the
need for secret analyzation of foreign biological

materials and/or weapons produced by the U.S.
intelligence community. Critics argue that such
research could just as easily—and far less
expensively—be handled by the sophisticated
laboratories at HEW's Communicable Disease
Center in Atlanta, Ga.
Even if the biological agents are destroyed,
and Eort Detrick and Pine Bluff shut down, the
failure of the United States to outlaw secret
research into biological warfare—defensive or
not—would seriously hinder one of the
important goals inherent in President Nixon's
statement last year—that of encouraging other
nations to follow the U.S. example and
renounce the use of biological warfare. Thus far
only the Netherlands has done so, an indication
that other nations have reservations about the
scope and seriousness of President Nixon's
November statement.
Rep. Richard D. McCarthy, New York
Democrat who led the Congressional fight
against chemical and biological warfare in 1969,
said in an interview that "As long as they keep
any programs secret anyone would be dubious
about what's going on. If it's legitimate
defensive research, there's no need to classify
it."
"There are grave questions here that arc
unanswered," McCarthy added. "The
Administration's credibility is at stake."

Army disposal. Yet no disposal has been made.
Osheroff now refuses to talk, and other public
health service officials will only say that the
dumping plan is still under review.
Both the biological production facility at
Pine Bluff, a super-secret area valued at more
than $100 million, and the biological research
facility at Fort Detrick, Md., the Army's main
biological center, are scheduled to be turned
over to the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare for medical and other non-military
research. The Pentagon initially scheduled such
an announcement last June. 19, but abruptly
canceled a news briefing on the matter when,
according to officials, the White House lodged
an objection.
There has been no further official word since
then, although some jobs at Pine Bluff and Fort
Detrick are scheduled to be cut back.
More Money
Despite the cutbacks, the Army's 1971
budget request for biological warfare research
was $23.2 million, about $1.3 million more than
was appropriated for such work in the current
fiscal year. Overall, in fact, the Army's research
and development program for next year will be

$74.9 million, more than $3 million higher than
the current budget.
Another contradictory area involves defensive
biological research. White House officials have
repeatedly emphasized that the defensive
research authorized by the President last
November would be limited to immunization
and other protective measures. At the Florida
news briefing last February, the White House
specifically said "there will be no need for secret
research in this field under this program."
Yet many administration sources
acknowledged in interviews that at least one
major classified program involving biological
warfare research will continue at the Army's
main test center in Dugway, Utah, site of the
errant nerve gas test in March, 1968, that killed
6,000 sheep. As many as 250 civilian scientists
from Pine Bluff and Fort Detrick will be
transferred, or are in the process of doing so, to
the Utah base to continue the biological
program.
Defensive Measure
A Pentagon official, asked about the report,
said the programs at the Dugway Proving
Grounds were defensive in nature and would not
need to be classified.
A major argument offered by the military for
the classified program at Dugway involves the
need for secret analyzation of foreign biological

materials and/or weapons produced by the U.S.
intelligence community. Critics argue that such
research could just as easily—and far less
expensively—be handled by the sophisticated
laboratories at HEW's Communicable Disease
Center in Atlanta, Ga.
Even if the biological agents are destroyed,
and Eort Detrick and Pine Bluff shut down, the
failure of the United States to outlaw secret
research into biological warfare—defensive or
not—would seriously hinder one of the
important goals inherent in President Nixon's
statement last year—that of encouraging other
nations to follow the U.S. example and
renounce the use of biological warfare. Thus far
only the Netherlands has done so, an indication
that other nations have reservations about the
scope and seriousness of President Nixon's
November statement.
Rep. Richard D. McCarthy, New York
Democrat who led the Congressional fight
against chemical and biological warfare in 1969,
said in an interview that "As long as they keep
any programs secret anyone would be dubious
about what's going on. If it's legitimate
defensive research, there's no need to classify
it."
"There are grave questions here that arc
unanswered," McCarthy added. "The
Administration's credibility is at stake."
Dispatch News Service
WASHINGTON — Despite a presidential
renunciation of biological warfare nearly 10
months ago, the United States is still
maintaining a vast stockpile of lethal biological
agents.
Approximately 10,000 gallons of some of the
most deadly killers known to man—including the
dreaded disease Anthrax—are now stored at the
Army's biological production center at Pine
Bluff, Ark.
President Nixon announced November 25,
1969, that the United States would get out of
the biological warfare field, except for a small
program of defensive research. At a briefing on
the matter on February 14,1970, at the Florida
White House, a high White House official assured
newsmen that the biological agents and weapons
were "in the process of being destroyed."
Yet it can now be reported that four
biological warfare agents are currently in the
U.S. stockpile. The agents and their military
codenames are: Tularemia, known as TT in its
wet storage form and ZZ in its dry, cold storage
form; Q Fever, called MN in its wet form and
NT when dry-stored; Anthrax known as TR-2 in
dry storage form and Venezuelan Equine
Encephalitis, known as TI).
The existence of the agents and their
codenames is still regarded as classified

information by the Pentagon, although President
Nixon has specifically renounced their use, even
in retaliation.
Sophisticated Warfare
In addition, the military has developed a
dozen sophisticated biological warfare spray
tanks, bombs, and other delivery systems
capable of disseminating dry or wet biological
agents from most of the attack planes now in
the U.S. arsenal. Special bombs for use or the
huge B-5 2 bombers even have been devised. The
development, testing, and procurement of the
delivery systems was conducted in strict secrecy.
The continued existence of the large
stockpiles and delivery' systems underlies the
contradictions and inconsistencies among
various Administration agencies as the
government seeks to implement the Presidential
declaration.
For example, public health officials
announced in June that they were "fully
satisfied" with an Army plan to dispose of the
biological materials at Pine Bluff by rendering
them harmless and spreading them about the
base. An earlier Army plan to sterilize the agents
and dump them into the Arkansas River had
been vetoed.
No Chance
Boris Osheroff, special assistant to the

surgeon general, told a newsman in June that
"There is absolutely no chance of living
organisms coming through intact" after the
Army disposal. Yet no disposal has been made.

WASHINGTON — Despite a presidential
renunciation of biological warfare nearly 10
months ago, the United States is still
maintaining a vast stockpile of lethal biological
agents.
Approximately 10,000 gallons of some of the
most deadly killers known to man—including the
dreaded disease Anthrax—are now stored at the
Army's biological production center at Pine
Bluff, Ark.
President Nixon announced November 25,
1969, that the United States would get out of
the biological warfare field, except for a small
program of defensive research. At a briefing on
the matter on February 14,1970, at the Florida
White House, a high White House official assured
newsmen that the biological agents and weapons
were "in the process of being destroyed."
Yet it can now be reported that four
biological warfare agents are currently in the
U.S. stockpile. The agents and their military
codenames are: Tularemia, known as TT in its
wet storage form and ZZ in its dry, cold storage
form; Q Fever, called MN in its wet form and
NT when dry-stored; Anthrax known as TR-2 in
dry storage form and Venezuelan Equine
Encephalitis, known as TI).
The existence of the agents and their
codenames is still regarded as classified

information by the Pentagon, although President
Nixon has specifically renounced their use, even
in retaliation.
Sophisticated Warfare
In addition, the military has developed a
dozen sophisticated biological warfare spray
tanks, bombs, and other delivery systems
capable of disseminating dry or wet biological
agents from most of the attack planes now in
the U.S. arsenal. Special bombs for use or the
huge B-5 2 bombers even have been devised. The
development, testing, and procurement of the
delivery systems was conducted in strict secrecy.
The continued existence of the large
stockpiles and delivery' systems underlies the
contradictions and inconsistencies among
various Administration agencies as the
government seeks to implement the Presidential
declaration.
For example, public health officials
announced in June that they were "fully
satisfied" with an Army plan to dispose of the
biological materials at Pine Bluff by rendering
them harmless and spreading them about the
base. An earlier Army plan to sterilize the agents
and dump them into the Arkansas River had
been vetoed.
No Chance
Boris Osheroff, special assistant to the

surgeon general, told a newsman in June that
"There is absolutely no chance of living
organisms coming through intact" after the
Army disposal. Yet no disposal has been made.
Osheroff now refuses to talk, and other public
health service officials will only say that the
dumping plan is still under review.
Both the biological production facility at
Pine Bluff, a super-secret area valued at more
than $100 million, and the biological research
facility at Fort Detrick, Md., the Army's main
biological center, are scheduled to be turned
over to the Department of Health, Education
and Welfare for medical and other non-military
research. The Pentagon initially scheduled such
an announcement last June. 19, but abruptly
canceled a news briefing on the matter when,
according to officials, the White House lodged
an objection.
There has been no further official word since
then, although some jobs at Pine Bluff and Fort
Detrick are scheduled to be cut back.
More Money
Despite the cutbacks, the Army's 1971
budget request for biological warfare research
was $23.2 million, about $1.3 million more than
was appropriated for such work in the current
fiscal year. Overall, in fact, the Army's research
and development program for next year will be

$74.9 million, more than $3 million higher than
the current budget.
Another contradictory area involves defensive
biological research. White House officials have
repeatedly emphasized that the defensive
research authorized by the President last
November would be limited to immunization
and other protective measures. At the Florida
news briefing last February, the White House
specifically said "there will be no need for secret
research in this field under this program."
Yet many administration sources
acknowledged in interviews that at least one
major classified program involving biological
warfare research will continue at the Army's
main test center in Dugway, Utah, site of the
errant nerve gas test in March, 1968, that killed
6,000 sheep. As many as 250 civilian scientists
from Pine Bluff and Fort Detrick will be
transferred, or are in the process of doing so, to
the Utah base to continue the biological
program.
Defensive Measure
A Pentagon official, asked about the report,
said the programs at the Dugway Proving
Grounds were defensive in nature and would not
need to be classified.
A major argument offered by the military for
the classified program at Dugway involves the
need for secret analyzation of foreign biological

materials and/or weapons produced by the U.S.
intelligence community. Critics argue that such
research could just as easily—and far less
expensively—be handled by the sophisticated
laboratories at HEW's Communicable Disease
Center in Atlanta, Ga.
Even if the biological agents are destroyed,
and Eort Detrick and Pine Bluff shut down, the
