# women workers' manifesto
## Sexism: Part II 
### 
~ linda crouse

In part I (printed Friday) we
saw women faculty were
overwhelmingly placed in the
lower paying, lower status
positions of research assistants,
research associates, instructors
and lecturers. Only one out of ten
faculty women make it to the
professorial level, compared to
one out of two faculty men.
On the staff side, if you looked
at the Stanford "minority"
employment report you found
that about 70 percent of men

workers are put into professional
positions (professional positions
require a college degree or
equivalent training), or into
official and managerial positions.
Most women, including those with
bachelor's or master's degrees are
placed in clerical positions
(clerical positions include all
clerical work regardless of
difficulty or education required).
Clerical positions pay about 1 /2
to 1/3 as much as the typically
male categories.

What can we do about this
situation?
Presidential executive order
11 375 bars federal contractors
from discriminating against
individuals because of sex. This
applies to all aspects of
employment, and federal
contracts can be withheld for
non-compliance with the order.
Contractors are required to take
"affirmative action" if a pattern
of discrimination is found.
Hopefully Stanford will
voluntarily file a plan of
affirmative action with teeth in it.
This means the following:
—It must not only present an
analysis of the problem, but must
itemize specific goals with
timetables to correct inequities.
—It must establish an
implementing and research body.
—It must enforce this plan.
An implementing body should
be a Women's Office at the
vice-presidential level. One of its
primary tasks should be to collect
data in three areas:
1) Job inequities: The
distribution of women faculty by
status, rank and pay should be the
same as the distribution for men,
regardless of the number of men
and women on the faculty. The
same holds for staff women.
2) Job classification: Staff
women should be placed in
positions of the same status and
pay as men with comparable
educational backgrounds. This

means that many women with
degrees should be upgraded from
their clerical positions to
managerial and professional
categories. If a clerical job
requires a degree or special skills,
the worker should be paid on a
professional level.
3) Selection rates: Students at
all levels should be admitted to
Stanford on the basis of ability
without regard to sex. Women
faculty should be hired in
proportion to the number of
women trained by a department.
Technical, service, clerical
women must have an effective
union.
Women must be in positions of
power and decision making. The
Women's Office, then, would
monitor staff and faculty
appointments, promotions and
pay. It would not control specific
appointments but could
determine if in fact a department
was reducing sex discrimination
according to the University's plan
of action.
Collecting statistics means
nothing if the University doesn't
act on them. It must require the
following of every department
shown to have a pattern of
discrimination:
1) The chairman must submit a
plan with timetable.
2) Every department is
required to comply with
Department of Labor guidelines.
3) The department is required
to release all statistics requested
by the Women's Office.
The Women's Office will
publish a yearly and public report
on a department and
University-wide basis.
Currently women have to
individually complain of
discrimination. This mechanism is
unrealistic because the women
being discriminated against is in

an already bad position. She is the
least likely individual to rock the
boat more. In the end she loses by
complaining regardless of the
official outcome of a review
board. A plan of "affirmative
action" means that instead of
placing the burden of complaint
on individual women, we place
the burden of enforcement on the
University.
Women workers are the lowest
paid "minority" group on
campus. Twice as large a
percentage of minority males get
put into the higher paying
professional, technical and
managerial positions. Women

workers and faculty want a
specific plan and powers of
enforcement to change this, and
they hope that the University will
voluntarily take action. The
government has just held up
contracts to Harvard, Michigan
and other universities because
women at them complained of a
pattern of discrimination.
Any individual can file
complaints with the Office of
Federal Contract Compliance, the
Department of Labor. Or with the
Civil Rights Division, HEW, as the
Civil Rights Act prohibits
discrimination because of sex in
all conditions of employment.
