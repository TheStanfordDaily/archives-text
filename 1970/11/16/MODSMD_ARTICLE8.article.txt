## Racism Manifested Again 
### 
black students union

The accusations levied against
Chris Banks by last week's
ARENA were not only a personal
attack on the brother, but also an
attack on the Black community.
At this point we are not
concerned with refuting the
blatant lies that were printed.
Chris has exposed them already.
Our concern is rather with
focusing on the racist nature of a
few individuals who have a
publication in their power, the
political implications, and the
psychopathology to which Black
people have been subjected for
too long.
Having experienced a similar
incident exactly one year ago,
involving the same kind of
journalistic slander from the same
newspaper, the Black Students
Union made it clear that we had
no intention of tolerating it. But
for some reason there continue to
exist persons like those on the
ARENA staff who cannot
understand, or refuse to accept
the fact that Black students ain't
bullshitin!
Just as the ARENA printed a
picture of a blonde reading a book
(the epitome of white beauty),
under which the caption read,
"Intelligence is a product of
heredity, not environment," and
just as the ARENA printed an
article in which three Black
women were referred to as "spade
chicks," it is the ARENA once
again unleashing its racist
mentality.
The psychology of the matter

is that Black students are now
much more a part of the campus
political games that were once
dominated and controlled by
whites. It should be pointed out
that we are not here to play
games. We are here struggling to
survive. Yet it seems to hurt the
"superior" white conservative
conscience to even conceive of the
possibility that Black students
could gain some kind of campus
political power.
This fall marks the largest
number of Blacks ever to run for
the 40 seat student senate. Given
this racist mentality, the ARENA
cannot help but cry "cheat" if
Black students are elected.
Thus, we are not fooled, nor
tricked in any sense by the fact
that the ARENA refrained from
directly implicating the Black
Students Union. Simply by its
racist Nixonian politics (ardent
lies), and its history of shit-sheet
journalism, the ARENA attack on
the competence of brother Chris
Banks is an attack on all Black
students.

That much of the BSU article
was devoted to last year's
misunderstanding indicates the
shaky ground on which the BSU
argument rests. In its most recent
issue, the ARENA essentially
stated: Chris Banks was a lousy

Elections Commissioner. I
reiterate this opinion, as I am
satisfied that the evidence is
overwhelming in support of this
contention. The fact that Chris
Banks is black does not exempt
him from criticism, any more than
Kenneth Pitzer's whiteness
exempted him from being a bad
President. The question of race
simply plays no part in the
election controversy.

Bill Buckley once philosophized
that one should not answer a
fallacious charge since the answer
itself might point to possible guilt.
Even though I normally admire
Mr. Buckley's sense of wisdom, I
cannot prevent myself from
answering the BSU's fallacious
charge that the ARENA is racist.
The charges leveled against
Chris Banks are completely true;
the article on the election
commissioner that appeared in the
last ARENA was not initiated
because of Mr. Bank's affiliation
with the BSU; the ARENA is not,
nor are any of its staff members
to my knowledge, in any way
racist.
It is unfortunate that the BSU
must cloud the issue of Chris
Bank's disasterous handling of the
Senate election with
counter-charges of
"racist-smears."
