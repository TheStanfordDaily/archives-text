# Retraction

### 
Ray White has asked the Daily
to retract several allegedly libelous
statements made in a column by
Diarmuid McGuire on October 2,
19 70. We have decided that two
of these statements should be
retracted and that the others are
not libelous and must stand.
First, the retractions. As we
said in an editorial on October 8,
we regret printing the statements
that could be construed as
threatening the lives of White and
Roger Reed. Such statements are
contrary to Daily policy and we
retract them.
We also retract McGuire's
assertion that Roger Reed may
have profited by being a "snitch."
We know of no evidence that
indicates that this is true. White
claims that the implications of
this same statement also libel him.
We see no such implication, but if
it is suggested in the column, we
retract the suggestion.
Now, for the statements we
refuse to retract. White demands
that we rescind statements that
accuse him of being an oppressor,
and of being in some way
responsible for the murder of
Vietnamese.
We refuse to take back these
accusations, even though many of
us do not believe them and most
of us pass them off as rhetoric. If
we were to retract them, we
would be forced to quash some
columns expressing a class analysis
or a radical view of the Vietnam
war.
We have been told by our legal
counsel that these accusations
could be libelous, yet we are
forced to brush aside these
warnings in order to preserve in
our paper some semblance of a
free and open forum.
