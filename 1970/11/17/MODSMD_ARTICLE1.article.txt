# Methadone Program — A Road Back From Heroin
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF Last in a Series 
Each day beginning at 6 :30 a.m., nearly 200
men and women walk down the long halls of a
dingy rundown building to a small kitchenette.
They stop at the door, give their names to a
woman inside, and receive in return a small cup
of pink koolaid.
Some linger and talk to friends while many
hurry back out to the parking lot and drive off
to their jobs. All are former heroin addicts
taking part in a new project that may help them
to return to normal life.
All are part of the Santa Clara County's pilot
methadone treatment program in San Jose, the
most promising effort yet devised for solving the
problem of heroin addiction. According to the
program's director Dr. Avram Goldstein of the
Med School here, methadone "seems to be the
only program that is effective at all."
The key to the program's success lies in the
synthetic drug methadone, a
laboratory-developed drug which takes the place
of heroin in an addict's habit. By taking a high
dosage of methadone, an addict becomes
"tolerant," or unresponsive, to lower dosages of
other drugs.
No High
By lifting addicts off of their heroin habit,
they feel no high if they fall back on smack.
Methadone dulls the kick, and the attraction to
heroin's heavy hit is gone.
"The methadone program evaluates well
compared to others. You look at their records.
Psychiatrists don't have any luck, neither do
penal authorities, and neither do the half-way
houses," said Goldstein.
As he suggests, rehabilitation up to now has
been notable in its failure. Most prison programs

which included psychiatric consultation
succeeded in helping only one addict in ten
return to normal life. The vast majority did not
change, and when they were released, they were
soon back on the same streets, shooting smack,
and stealing to finance their habit.
No Results
One of the assistants at the methadone
program, an ex-addict named Joe, said, "1 went
through Tracy, Soledad, Chico, Vacaville,
Corona Rehabilitation Center, and none of them
got me off smack until I entered this program.
"There I was forced, here I can do what I
want. Here there are no walls, guards, or
shotguns. Here they come because they want to
come," he smiled.
For many addicts the hardest part of the
heroin experience is facing up to their grinding,
trapped life as they chase from fix to fix. But
the break free from the cycle is a tremendous
effort for some and nearly impossible for others.
Regain Their Balance
Methadone may help addicts regain their
balance and open the way to a new handling of
the heroin problem. It may outmode the past
reliance on intense counseling, encounter
groups, tranquilizer treatments, and repetitive
drug education that have so far proved
ineffective.
At the same time that methadone dulls the
potency of heroin, the achieved "tolerance" will
also fail to give the addict any kick from
methadone itself. Repeated doses at the same
level allow methadone to meet the demands of
the narcotic habit and no more.
In this manner methadone has a gradual,
calming effect on an addict. Instead of the fast
rush to a heroin high that most addicts feel, a
person on methadone will experience little since

the drug meets his physical cravings in a steady,
smooth pattern.
No Downs or Ups
On methadone an addict is able to lead a
more settled life and hold a job since there
would be no sharp, jangling down or up periods.
He also does not have to fear the mental and
physical shock of an abrupt return to the
straight world through the nightmare of a "cold
turkey" withdrawal.
Goldstein claims great success for his
program. "People have been on it for six or
seven months and are doing very well." All of

perhaps 1000. A group of young film-makers
who have just finished a movie on heroin use in
the Palo Alto area feel that there may be as
many assooo to 6000 addicts in San Jose alone.
New York and Oregon
New York and Oregon already have extensive
methadone programs on which the California
trial system is based. The San Jose clinic is one
of four in the state.
However, there is sharp criticism of
methadone on several points. Mike Dolan, one
of the makers, feels that setting up methadone
clinics is at best a partial solution. "The problem
is that the addict has to be willing to go into the
program. The addict in his subculture may want
to stay there. It's a free floating world for him."
Dolan pointed out that the program forces
some responsibility onto the addict that he may
be unready or unwilling to accept. "You have to
cut your hair, you have to show up on time, you
have to get a job—these are all things that an
addict may not want to do," Dolan observed.
More Addicts Now
He also pointed out that in Oregon where all
heroin addicts are admitted to the program, the
number of addicts continues to grow. "There's
more and more junk around today. We've got to
cut the supply as well as give addicts
methadone," Dolan said.
To achieve any solution, Dolan felt, "it takes
both sides giving in a little. We have to take
away some of the myth surrounding drugs, and I
think that the other side has to admit that grass
doesn't always lead to heroin."
Goldstein himself admits there are some
slight medical problems involved with
methadone, but he firmly defends it as the only
tested and successful method of curing heroin
addiction. He points to New York and Oregon's

programs as evidence of the initial success of the
new drug, but cautions that definitive results
will have to wait for several years when there
will be more patients by which to judge.
The Clinic
Goldstein's best evidence is the clinic. Since
the program began six months ago, many of the
addicts have "earned" the right to take several
days dosage home with them at once. By staying
''clean" of heroin, they prove to the doctors that
they are able to handle the responsibility of
rationing a three or four day dose themselves. At
random intervals the doctors check the patients
to see if they keep off smack.
One of the less successful patients is a 3 6-year
old named George who started taking drugs
when he was 17. At the bend of his arm is a
smooth red patch where his veins once were. "I
sort of shot them away," he said.
He smiles easily, joking with the other early
morning arrivals. Asked how methadone feels
compared to heroin, he laughed and said, "I
don't know what normal is. Sometimes I shoot
up and sometimes I don't. I do it just with some
friends occasionally."
George didn't feel that his inability to settle
down with methadone was a serious problem.
"For some they think it's a trippy thing, but for
me it's an outgoing sociable high where I want
to rap and do things," he said.
As much as he still enjoys an occasional hit,
he admits, "I had no life on heroin, and now I'm
going to school."
Just then a man in a black raincoat with a
leather briefcase rushed past. "See that cat?"
chuckled George. "He works in a real estate
office. He's really straight now. Before he was
worse than most guys, but now he's got it
together pretty well."


the nearly 200 people in the program are still in
it though some have moved out of the area or
are serving time in prisons. Nobody has dropped
out to return to the heroin life," said Goldstein.
The waiting list is long. One clinic worker
estimates that there are 300 addicts waiting to
be admitted. Goldstein has hopes that the clinic
will expand to 600 patient capacity and then

penal authorities, and neither do the half-way
houses," said Goldstein.
As he suggests, rehabilitation up to now has
been notable in its failure. Most prison programs

which included psychiatric consultation
succeeded in helping only one addict in ten
return to normal life. The vast majority did not
change, and when they were released, they were
soon back on the same streets, shooting smack,
and stealing to finance their habit.
No Results
One of the assistants at the methadone
program, an ex-addict named Joe, said, "1 went
through Tracy, Soledad, Chico, Vacaville,
Corona Rehabilitation Center, and none of them
got me off smack until I entered this program.
"There I was forced, here I can do what I
want. Here there are no walls, guards, or
shotguns. Here they come because they want to
come," he smiled.
For many addicts the hardest part of the
heroin experience is facing up to their grinding,
trapped life as they chase from fix to fix. But
the break free from the cycle is a tremendous
effort for some and nearly impossible for others.
Regain Their Balance
Methadone may help addicts regain their
balance and open the way to a new handling of
the heroin problem. It may outmode the past
reliance on intense counseling, encounter
groups, tranquilizer treatments, and repetitive
drug education that have so far proved
ineffective.
At the same time that methadone dulls the
potency of heroin, the achieved "tolerance" will
also fail to give the addict any kick from
methadone itself. Repeated doses at the same
level allow methadone to meet the demands of
the narcotic habit and no more.
In this manner methadone has a gradual,
calming effect on an addict. Instead of the fast
rush to a heroin high that most addicts feel, a
person on methadone will experience little since

the drug meets his physical cravings in a steady,
smooth pattern.
No Downs or Ups
On methadone an addict is able to lead a
more settled life and hold a job since there
would be no sharp, jangling down or up periods.
He also does not have to fear the mental and
physical shock of an abrupt return to the
straight world through the nightmare of a "cold
turkey" withdrawal.
Goldstein claims great success for his
program. "People have been on it for six or
seven months and are doing very well." All of

perhaps 1000. A group of young film-makers
who have just finished a movie on heroin use in
the Palo Alto area feel that there may be as
many assooo to 6000 addicts in San Jose alone.
New York and Oregon
New York and Oregon already have extensive
methadone programs on which the California
trial system is based. The San Jose clinic is one
of four in the state.
However, there is sharp criticism of
methadone on several points. Mike Dolan, one
of the makers, feels that setting up methadone
clinics is at best a partial solution. "The problem
is that the addict has to be willing to go into the
program. The addict in his subculture may want
to stay there. It's a free floating world for him."
Dolan pointed out that the program forces
some responsibility onto the addict that he may
be unready or unwilling to accept. "You have to
cut your hair, you have to show up on time, you
have to get a job—these are all things that an
addict may not want to do," Dolan observed.
More Addicts Now
He also pointed out that in Oregon where all
heroin addicts are admitted to the program, the
number of addicts continues to grow. "There's
more and more junk around today. We've got to
cut the supply as well as give addicts
methadone," Dolan said.
To achieve any solution, Dolan felt, "it takes
both sides giving in a little. We have to take
away some of the myth surrounding drugs, and I
think that the other side has to admit that grass
doesn't always lead to heroin."
Goldstein himself admits there are some
slight medical problems involved with
methadone, but he firmly defends it as the only
tested and successful method of curing heroin
addiction. He points to New York and Oregon's

programs as evidence of the initial success of the
new drug, but cautions that definitive results
will have to wait for several years when there
will be more patients by which to judge.
The Clinic
Goldstein's best evidence is the clinic. Since
the program began six months ago, many of the
addicts have "earned" the right to take several
days dosage home with them at once. By staying
''clean" of heroin, they prove to the doctors that
they are able to handle the responsibility of
rationing a three or four day dose themselves. At
random intervals the doctors check the patients
to see if they keep off smack.
One of the less successful patients is a 3 6-year
old named George who started taking drugs
when he was 17. At the bend of his arm is a
smooth red patch where his veins once were. "I
sort of shot them away," he said.
He smiles easily, joking with the other early
morning arrivals. Asked how methadone feels
compared to heroin, he laughed and said, "I
don't know what normal is. Sometimes I shoot
up and sometimes I don't. I do it just with some
friends occasionally."
George didn't feel that his inability to settle
down with methadone was a serious problem.
"For some they think it's a trippy thing, but for
me it's an outgoing sociable high where I want
to rap and do things," he said.
As much as he still enjoys an occasional hit,
he admits, "I had no life on heroin, and now I'm
going to school."
Just then a man in a black raincoat with a
leather briefcase rushed past. "See that cat?"
chuckled George. "He works in a real estate
office. He's really straight now. Before he was
worse than most guys, but now he's got it
together pretty well."


the nearly 200 people in the program are still in
it though some have moved out of the area or
are serving time in prisons. Nobody has dropped
out to return to the heroin life," said Goldstein.
The waiting list is long. One clinic worker
estimates that there are 300 addicts waiting to
be admitted. Goldstein has hopes that the clinic
will expand to 600 patient capacity and then
Each day beginning at 6 :30 a.m., nearly 200
men and women walk down the long halls of a
dingy rundown building to a small kitchenette.
They stop at the door, give their names to a
woman inside, and receive in return a small cup
of pink koolaid.
Some linger and talk to friends while many
hurry back out to the parking lot and drive off
to their jobs. All are former heroin addicts
taking part in a new project that may help them
to return to normal life.
All are part of the Santa Clara County's pilot
methadone treatment program in San Jose, the
most promising effort yet devised for solving the
problem of heroin addiction. According to the
program's director Dr. Avram Goldstein of the
Med School here, methadone "seems to be the
only program that is effective at all."
The key to the program's success lies in the
synthetic drug methadone, a
laboratory-developed drug which takes the place
of heroin in an addict's habit. By taking a high
dosage of methadone, an addict becomes
"tolerant," or unresponsive, to lower dosages of
other drugs.
No High
By lifting addicts off of their heroin habit,
they feel no high if they fall back on smack.
Methadone dulls the kick, and the attraction to
heroin's heavy hit is gone.
"The methadone program evaluates well
compared to others. You look at their records.
Psychiatrists don't have any luck, neither do
penal authorities, and neither do the half-way
houses," said Goldstein.

methadone itself. Repeated doses at the same
level allow methadone to meet the demands of
the narcotic habit and no more.
In this manner methadone has a gradual,
calming effect on an addict. Instead of the fast
rush to a heroin high that most addicts feel, a
person on methadone will experience little since

the drug meets his physical cravings in a steady,
smooth pattern.
No Downs or Ups
On methadone an addict is able to lead a
more settled life and hold a job since there
would be no sharp, jangling down or up periods.
He also does not have to fear the mental and
physical shock of an abrupt return to the
straight world through the nightmare of a "cold
turkey" withdrawal.
Goldstein claims great success for his
program. "People have been on it for six or
seven months and are doing very well." All of

perhaps 1000. A group of young film-makers
who have just finished a movie on heroin use in
the Palo Alto area feel that there may be as
many assooo to 6000 addicts in San Jose alone.
New York and Oregon
New York and Oregon already have extensive
methadone programs on which the California
trial system is based. The San Jose clinic is one
of four in the state.
However, there is sharp criticism of
methadone on several points. Mike Dolan, one
of the makers, feels that setting up methadone
clinics is at best a partial solution. "The problem
is that the addict has to be willing to go into the
program. The addict in his subculture may want
to stay there. It's a free floating world for him."
Dolan pointed out that the program forces
some responsibility onto the addict that he may
be unready or unwilling to accept. "You have to
cut your hair, you have to show up on time, you
have to get a job—these are all things that an
addict may not want to do," Dolan observed.
More Addicts Now
He also pointed out that in Oregon where all
heroin addicts are admitted to the program, the
number of addicts continues to grow. "There's
more and more junk around today. We've got to
cut the supply as well as give addicts
methadone," Dolan said.
To achieve any solution, Dolan felt, "it takes
both sides giving in a little. We have to take
away some of the myth surrounding drugs, and I
think that the other side has to admit that grass
doesn't always lead to heroin."
Goldstein himself admits there are some
slight medical problems involved with
methadone, but he firmly defends it as the only
tested and successful method of curing heroin
addiction. He points to New York and Oregon's

programs as evidence of the initial success of the
new drug, but cautions that definitive results
will have to wait for several years when there
will be more patients by which to judge.
The Clinic
Goldstein's best evidence is the clinic. Since
the program began six months ago, many of the
addicts have "earned" the right to take several
days dosage home with them at once. By staying
''clean" of heroin, they prove to the doctors that
they are able to handle the responsibility of
rationing a three or four day dose themselves. At
random intervals the doctors check the patients
to see if they keep off smack.
One of the less successful patients is a 3 6-year
old named George who started taking drugs
when he was 17. At the bend of his arm is a
smooth red patch where his veins once were. "I
sort of shot them away," he said.
He smiles easily, joking with the other early
morning arrivals. Asked how methadone feels
compared to heroin, he laughed and said, "I
don't know what normal is. Sometimes I shoot
up and sometimes I don't. I do it just with some
friends occasionally."
George didn't feel that his inability to settle
down with methadone was a serious problem.
"For some they think it's a trippy thing, but for
me it's an outgoing sociable high where I want
to rap and do things," he said.
As much as he still enjoys an occasional hit,
he admits, "I had no life on heroin, and now I'm
going to school."
Just then a man in a black raincoat with a
leather briefcase rushed past. "See that cat?"
chuckled George. "He works in a real estate
office. He's really straight now. Before he was
worse than most guys, but now he's got it
together pretty well."


the nearly 200 people in the program are still in
it though some have moved out of the area or
are serving time in prisons. Nobody has dropped
out to return to the heroin life," said Goldstein.
The waiting list is long. One clinic worker
estimates that there are 300 addicts waiting to
be admitted. Goldstein has hopes that the clinic
will expand to 600 patient capacity and then
Each day beginning at 6 :30 a.m., nearly 200
men and women walk down the long halls of a
dingy rundown building to a small kitchenette.
They stop at the door, give their names to a
woman inside, and receive in return a small cup
of pink koolaid.
Some linger and talk to friends while many
hurry back out to the parking lot and drive off
to their jobs. All are former heroin addicts
taking part in a new project that may help them
to return to normal life.
All are part of the Santa Clara County's pilot
methadone treatment program in San Jose, the
most promising effort yet devised for solving the
problem of heroin addiction. According to the
program's director Dr. Avram Goldstein of the
Med School here, methadone "seems to be the
only program that is effective at all."
The key to the program's success lies in the
synthetic drug methadone, a
laboratory-developed drug which takes the place
of heroin in an addict's habit. By taking a high
dosage of methadone, an addict becomes
"tolerant," or unresponsive, to lower dosages of
other drugs.
No High
By lifting addicts off of their heroin habit,
they feel no high if they fall back on smack.
Methadone dulls the kick, and the attraction to
heroin's heavy hit is gone.
"The methadone program evaluates well
compared to others. You look at their records.
Psychiatrists don't have any luck, neither do
penal authorities, and neither do the half-way
houses," said Goldstein.
As he suggests, rehabilitation up to now has
been notable in its failure. Most prison programs

which included psychiatric consultation
succeeded in helping only one addict in ten
return to normal life. The vast majority did not
change, and when they were released, they were
soon back on the same streets, shooting smack,
and stealing to finance their habit.
No Results
One of the assistants at the methadone
program, an ex-addict named Joe, said, "1 went
through Tracy, Soledad, Chico, Vacaville,
Corona Rehabilitation Center, and none of them
got me off smack until I entered this program.
"There I was forced, here I can do what I
want. Here there are no walls, guards, or
shotguns. Here they come because they want to
come," he smiled.
For many addicts the hardest part of the
heroin experience is facing up to their grinding,
trapped life as they chase from fix to fix. But
the break free from the cycle is a tremendous
effort for some and nearly impossible for others.
Regain Their Balance
Methadone may help addicts regain their
balance and open the way to a new handling of
the heroin problem. It may outmode the past
reliance on intense counseling, encounter
groups, tranquilizer treatments, and repetitive
drug education that have so far proved
ineffective.

program. The addict in his subculture may want
to stay there. It's a free floating world for him."
Dolan pointed out that the program forces
some responsibility onto the addict that he may
be unready or unwilling to accept. "You have to
cut your hair, you have to show up on time, you
have to get a job—these are all things that an
addict may not want to do," Dolan observed.

He also pointed out that in Oregon where all
heroin addicts are admitted to the program, the
number of addicts continues to grow. "There's
more and more junk around today. We've got to
cut the supply as well as give addicts
methadone," Dolan said.
To achieve any solution, Dolan felt, "it takes
both sides giving in a little. We have to take
away some of the myth surrounding drugs, and I
think that the other side has to admit that grass
doesn't always lead to heroin."
Goldstein himself admits there are some
slight medical problems involved with
methadone, but he firmly defends it as the only
tested and successful method of curing heroin
addiction. He points to New York and Oregon's

programs as evidence of the initial success of the
new drug, but cautions that definitive results
will have to wait for several years when there
will be more patients by which to judge.
The Clinic
Goldstein's best evidence is the clinic. Since
the program began six months ago, many of the
addicts have "earned" the right to take several
days dosage home with them at once. By staying
''clean" of heroin, they prove to the doctors that
they are able to handle the responsibility of
rationing a three or four day dose themselves. At
random intervals the doctors check the patients
to see if they keep off smack.
One of the less successful patients is a 3 6-year
old named George who started taking drugs
when he was 17. At the bend of his arm is a
smooth red patch where his veins once were. "I
sort of shot them away," he said.
He smiles easily, joking with the other early
morning arrivals. Asked how methadone feels
compared to heroin, he laughed and said, "I
don't know what normal is. Sometimes I shoot
up and sometimes I don't. I do it just with some
friends occasionally."
George didn't feel that his inability to settle
down with methadone was a serious problem.
"For some they think it's a trippy thing, but for
me it's an outgoing sociable high where I want
to rap and do things," he said.
As much as he still enjoys an occasional hit,
he admits, "I had no life on heroin, and now I'm
going to school."
Just then a man in a black raincoat with a
leather briefcase rushed past. "See that cat?"
chuckled George. "He works in a real estate
office. He's really straight now. Before he was
worse than most guys, but now he's got it
together pretty well."


the nearly 200 people in the program are still in
it though some have moved out of the area or
are serving time in prisons. Nobody has dropped
out to return to the heroin life," said Goldstein.
The waiting list is long. One clinic worker
estimates that there are 300 addicts waiting to
be admitted. Goldstein has hopes that the clinic
will expand to 600 patient capacity and then
Each day beginning at 6 :30 a.m., nearly 200
men and women walk down the long halls of a
dingy rundown building to a small kitchenette.
They stop at the door, give their names to a
woman inside, and receive in return a small cup
of pink koolaid.
Some linger and talk to friends while many
hurry back out to the parking lot and drive off
to their jobs. All are former heroin addicts
taking part in a new project that may help them
to return to normal life.
All are part of the Santa Clara County's pilot
methadone treatment program in San Jose, the
most promising effort yet devised for solving the
problem of heroin addiction. According to the
program's director Dr. Avram Goldstein of the
Med School here, methadone "seems to be the
only program that is effective at all."
The key to the program's success lies in the
synthetic drug methadone, a
laboratory-developed drug which takes the place
of heroin in an addict's habit. By taking a high
dosage of methadone, an addict becomes
"tolerant," or unresponsive, to lower dosages of
other drugs.
No High
By lifting addicts off of their heroin habit,
they feel no high if they fall back on smack.
Methadone dulls the kick, and the attraction to
heroin's heavy hit is gone.
"The methadone program evaluates well
compared to others. You look at their records.
Psychiatrists don't have any luck, neither do
penal authorities, and neither do the half-way
houses," said Goldstein.
As he suggests, rehabilitation up to now has
been notable in its failure. Most prison programs

which included psychiatric consultation
succeeded in helping only one addict in ten
return to normal life. The vast majority did not
change, and when they were released, they were
soon back on the same streets, shooting smack,
and stealing to finance their habit.
No Results
One of the assistants at the methadone
program, an ex-addict named Joe, said, "1 went
through Tracy, Soledad, Chico, Vacaville,
Corona Rehabilitation Center, and none of them
got me off smack until I entered this program.
"There I was forced, here I can do what I
want. Here there are no walls, guards, or
shotguns. Here they come because they want to
come," he smiled.
For many addicts the hardest part of the
heroin experience is facing up to their grinding,
trapped life as they chase from fix to fix. But
the break free from the cycle is a tremendous
effort for some and nearly impossible for others.
Regain Their Balance
Methadone may help addicts regain their
balance and open the way to a new handling of
the heroin problem. It may outmode the past
reliance on intense counseling, encounter
groups, tranquilizer treatments, and repetitive
drug education that have so far proved
ineffective.
At the same time that methadone dulls the
potency of heroin, the achieved "tolerance" will
also fail to give the addict any kick from
methadone itself. Repeated doses at the same
level allow methadone to meet the demands of
the narcotic habit and no more.
In this manner methadone has a gradual,
calming effect on an addict. Instead of the fast
rush to a heroin high that most addicts feel, a
person on methadone will experience little since

the drug meets his physical cravings in a steady,
smooth pattern.
No Downs or Ups
On methadone an addict is able to lead a
more settled life and hold a job since there
would be no sharp, jangling down or up periods.
He also does not have to fear the mental and
physical shock of an abrupt return to the
straight world through the nightmare of a "cold
turkey" withdrawal.
Goldstein claims great success for his
program. "People have been on it for six or
seven months and are doing very well." All of

perhaps 1000. A group of young film-makers
who have just finished a movie on heroin use in
the Palo Alto area feel that there may be as
many assooo to 6000 addicts in San Jose alone.
New York and Oregon
New York and Oregon already have extensive
methadone programs on which the California
trial system is based. The San Jose clinic is one
of four in the state.
However, there is sharp criticism of
methadone on several points. Mike Dolan, one
of the makers, feels that setting up methadone
clinics is at best a partial solution. "The problem
is that the addict has to be willing to go into the
program. The addict in his subculture may want
to stay there. It's a free floating world for him."
Dolan pointed out that the program forces
some responsibility onto the addict that he may
be unready or unwilling to accept. "You have to
cut your hair, you have to show up on time, you
have to get a job—these are all things that an
addict may not want to do," Dolan observed.
