# Really Gay Gaieties Opens This Week
## 
### 
Ram's Head Productions'
annual Big Game Show -"The
Gaieties"—at Stanford Univesity is
living up to its name this year.
The presentation, entitled Couples
Only, has nothing to do with
sheep or football games but has a
lot to do with "gaieties" the two
principal characters are
homosexuals.
Set at Stanford during Spring
quarter, the show takes a musical
look at four student couples and
their problems. The action

revolves around Jack Townsend's
efforts to keep his "straight"
friends happy with their
respective better-halves while
trying to maintain a stable
relationship with his romantic
interest Bruce.
John M. Trowbridge, a
Stanford undergraduate in music,
wrote the book, music and lyrics.
His ideas for the show were
"based largely on my own
experiences with other college
students." Mr. Trowbridge also
commented, "In writing Couples
Only I approached the subject of
male homosexuality from what
might be called an unorthodox
point of view. Instead of treating
homosexuality in the usual
analytical style, I looked at it from
a romantic standpoint and worked
from there."
Director Jay Morris, when
asked about his feelings toward
the show, replied, "7 agreed to
direct before I had even seen or
heard anything about the script.
Now, having just about finished
my work, I find that the show is
quite entertaining and makes no
pretenses of being another social
commentary on honosexuality."
Tickets for the show, which is
being sponsored by the ASSU
Special Events Board, may be
purchased at the Tresidder Union
Box Office (Stanford University)
or at the door. The performances
will be November 1H and 21 at
