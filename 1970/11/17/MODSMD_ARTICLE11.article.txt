# Blah Day In Rock City

### TOM SMALL 
Undiscouraged by an earlier loss doing the same thing, the Palo
Alto Jaycee's put on a rock concert at the Baylands Athletic Center
last Sunday afternoon. The crowd was as big as the outfield, and the
two dollar gate went to charitable works and public services. Kicked
off with boppin Fast Eddie (current sounds at Mom's P.A.) the white
revue torqued out with Nevada, whereupon Fast Eddie returned to do
their club set since Tower of Power didn't show; and Alum was also
late, though they did finally do a long soulful set, which was
unfortunate. To the befuzzlcment of all, there wasn't enough time left
for Big Brother (who were present and ready to play), since it was
supposed to be over by 4:00 p.m. Oh well, people like to drive
home in rush hour traffic, and seriously, the Jaycees deserve lots of
good credit for going through all the hassles associated with rock
festival production; we hope to see more. Buffalo Springfield and
Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young records, the major musical event of
the day, played through an excellent PA system, and the peanut
butter and honey sandwiches were outstanding.
