# SCIRE -- Student Initiated Education
## 
### JOE PRESTON 
SCIRE, the Student Center for
Innovation in Research and
Education was established on the
belief that Stanford students
ought to determine more of their
own education. Implementing this
principle, SCIRE grants credit to
students for courses ranging from
suicide study to Guyana
Queh-Queh dances to
anthropological research in
Mexico.
Students with ideas for courses
not usually offered in the
traditional University structure

may go to the Center which will
help the student initiate the
course, find a sponsor and receive
credit for the project.
In addition, about half the
courses in the new Urban Studies
Program receive credit from
SCIRE. In fact, the center
sponsored the original course last
spring which developed into the
Urban Studies Program this year.
Next quarter SCIRE will offer
credit for a study of the
possibility of receiving credit for
work with Volunteers in Asia.
This project is one aspect of a
general SCIRE effort to develop
more University "education by
experience." Ideally, a regular
work-study program will be set
up.
SCIRE also provides valuable
support for this quarter's existing
programs. The popular SWOPSI
course on police, for example,
receives credit from the center.
Besides helping new programs
get on their way, SCIRE has
secured instructors and credit for
individual student projects which
are as varied as are student

interests. Under SCIRE auspices,
one student is continuing work
this quarter on the municipal
government of Sacramento.
When a girl became interested
in pottery glazes, the center found
her an instructor for research into
the chemistry of glazes.
Another student wanted to
learn Bengali. The center located
an instructor and two more
students came to join the course.
Since most of the courses
taken under the center are
pass-fail, public evaluation of their
success in encouraged. Later this
quarter students learning Guyana
Queh-Queh dances from a native
of Guyana will perform on stilts
in White Plaza.
Similarly, a slide presentation
will be given by a student who
received credit for his
anthropological research in
Oaxaca, Mexico, this past
summer.
The center is governed by a
policy board of five faculty and
six student members, who
determine the amount of credit

each course receives and manage
funding, evaluation and publicity.
This year the center is supported
by the Eord Foundation
innovation fund administered by
the University Fellows. Next year
the center will begin to support
itself.
Student center director, Lana
De Salve, maintains a file of over
120 "Friends of the Center."
faculty members and others who
have indicated willingness to
sponsor courses. When no
particular faculty member can be
found to sponsor a course the
center can provide outside experts
who are given temporary
academic appointments. The
study of suicide is currently
sponsored by two such volunteers
from San Francisco.
One of the major interests of
the center is interesting average
students in courses of their own.
Too often, according to Lana,
these students tend to think of
outside work as the private
preserve of honor students well
established in their majors.

However, she explained, any
student can initiate or join one of
the center's courses.
Over 35 0 students have taken
courses under the center since
SCIRE began last spring, and
many more are expected to use it
in the future. The deadline for
course proposals for winter
quarter is Wednesday, November
25. Interested students should
drop by the center in room
590-A, Old Union.
