# Bicycle Thefts On Campus Becoming Big Business
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
"Always lock your bike."
This standard warning is given
to nearly all Stanford freshmen
and new bike-owners. Other
precautions against theft are
registering and licensing bikes.
Bicycle-stealing has become a
major problem on the campus,
and according to Stanford police
records, it is getting worse.
Nearly 400 bikes have been
stolen from campus parking sites
since the beginning of June, 1 970.
Of these, barely five percent have
been reocvered. Palo Alto thefts
are also increasing, but because of
the availability of bikes, the
situation is worse on the campus.
Ignoring the danger of losing
their bicycles, a few students fail
to lock theirs. Most do, however.
Of 30 4 bikes parked near Wilbur
Hall, Branner, UGLY, the
bookstore, and Tresidder Union,
96 percent were locked. Either
one wheel was locked in position,
or the entire vehicle was fastened
in some way to a post or bike
rack.
Locks Not Enough
According to Captain William
Wullschleger of the Stanford
Police Department, locking the
bicycle is not always enough. He
estimates that about half of the
bikes stolen were locked.
"Wire cutters can cut through
the lighter wires and cables that
people use to lock their bikes," he
reports. "The cutters are small
enough to be concealed on one's
person.
"A heavy chain with a padlock
or even a double lock is better
security. Bolt cutters, which are

like long-handled pruning shears
and harder to hide, are needed to
cut heavy chains.
"Sometimes, when the wheel is
locked to the bike frame, or to a
rack, the wheel is simply removed
to steal the bike."
There has also been mass theft,
when trucks have come on
campus at night to carry away
racks of bikes.
Old bikes, whose owners have
not considered them worth
locking, are sometimes
"borrowed" for transportation
and then abandoned at, for
instance, the stadium. Captain
Wullschleger believes that
10-speed bikes are more likely to
be stolen, "probably because they
can be resold for more."
Theft Report
To report a stolen bicycle to
the Stanford police, an individual
fills out a form giving the make,
serial number, color, license
number, and general description.
Too often, the owner or an
unregistered bike cannot recall the
serial number, which complicates
recovery and identification.
The case is then filed under the
person's name, the serial number
and the license number. Before
each area bike sale, stolen bikes'
serial numbers are circulated to
precinct police stations to
forestall large-scale auction of
"hot" bikes.
Stealing bikes, unlike stealing
motor vehicles, is petty theft
rahter than a felony. Juveniles are
generally responsible for bike
thefts and sometimes work in
gangs. For this reason, when

schools are out during the
summer, the theft rate is highest.
In June, 140 bikes were stolen,
but only 5 9 disappeared last
month. About 130 have been
stolen since the beginning of the
school year, while 2 70 were
reported missing this past
summer.
Registration Important
Once stolen, bicycles are most
easily recovered and indentified if
they are registered. Registration
was available a few weeks ago for
fifty cents on campus. A sticker
on the bike shows it is registered,
and even if the sticker is removed,
the serial number is still filed with
the Stnaford police.
Despite the ready avialability
of registration, Wullschleger
believes that a "low percentage"
of students takes advantage of the
opportunity, although he believes
it is worthwhile.
If, for example, a patrolman
notices a locked bike being carried
or driven away in a car, he can
stop the car and check the bike's
serial number with headquarters.
If it is on file as being stolen, he is
in a position to do something. If,
however, the serial number is not
recorded, he is not able to prove
anything, since people
legitimately transport bikes in
cars. A general description is not
specific enough to trace most
stolen bikes.
Bicycle theft presents a
definite problem to the police and
primarily to Stanford students.
The only precautions—a heavy
chain and lock, registration,
licensing—are not always
sufficient protection against it.

rack.
Locks Not Enough
According to Captain William
Wullschleger of the Stanford
Police Department, locking the
bicycle is not always enough. He
estimates that about half of the
bikes stolen were locked.
"Wire cutters can cut through
the lighter wires and cables that
people use to lock their bikes," he
reports. "The cutters are small
enough to be concealed on one's
person.
"A heavy chain with a padlock
or even a double lock is better
security. Bolt cutters, which are

like long-handled pruning shears
and harder to hide, are needed to
cut heavy chains.
"Sometimes, when the wheel is
locked to the bike frame, or to a
rack, the wheel is simply removed
to steal the bike."
There has also been mass theft,
when trucks have come on
campus at night to carry away
racks of bikes.
Old bikes, whose owners have
not considered them worth
locking, are sometimes
"borrowed" for transportation
and then abandoned at, for
instance, the stadium. Captain
Wullschleger believes that
10-speed bikes are more likely to
be stolen, "probably because they
can be resold for more."
Theft Report
To report a stolen bicycle to
the Stanford police, an individual
fills out a form giving the make,
serial number, color, license
number, and general description.
Too often, the owner or an
unregistered bike cannot recall the
serial number, which complicates
recovery and identification.
The case is then filed under the
person's name, the serial number
and the license number. Before
each area bike sale, stolen bikes'
serial numbers are circulated to
precinct police stations to
forestall large-scale auction of
"hot" bikes.
Stealing bikes, unlike stealing
motor vehicles, is petty theft
rahter than a felony. Juveniles are
generally responsible for bike
thefts and sometimes work in
gangs. For this reason, when

schools are out during the
summer, the theft rate is highest.
In June, 140 bikes were stolen,
but only 5 9 disappeared last
month. About 130 have been
stolen since the beginning of the
school year, while 2 70 were
reported missing this past
summer.
Registration Important
Once stolen, bicycles are most
easily recovered and indentified if
they are registered. Registration
was available a few weeks ago for
fifty cents on campus. A sticker
on the bike shows it is registered,
and even if the sticker is removed,
the serial number is still filed with
the Stnaford police.
Despite the ready avialability
of registration, Wullschleger
believes that a "low percentage"
of students takes advantage of the
opportunity, although he believes
it is worthwhile.
If, for example, a patrolman
notices a locked bike being carried
or driven away in a car, he can
stop the car and check the bike's
serial number with headquarters.
If it is on file as being stolen, he is
in a position to do something. If,
however, the serial number is not
recorded, he is not able to prove
anything, since people
legitimately transport bikes in
cars. A general description is not
specific enough to trace most
stolen bikes.
Bicycle theft presents a
definite problem to the police and
primarily to Stanford students.
The only precautions—a heavy
chain and lock, registration,
licensing—are not always
sufficient protection against it.
"Always lock your bike."
This standard warning is given
to nearly all Stanford freshmen
and new bike-owners. Other
precautions against theft are
registering and licensing bikes.
Bicycle-stealing has become a
major problem on the campus,
and according to Stanford police
records, it is getting worse.
Nearly 400 bikes have been
stolen from campus parking sites
since the beginning of June, 1 970.
Of these, barely five percent have
been reocvered. Palo Alto thefts
are also increasing, but because of
the availability of bikes, the
situation is worse on the campus.
Ignoring the danger of losing
their bicycles, a few students fail
to lock theirs. Most do, however.
Of 30 4 bikes parked near Wilbur
Hall, Branner, UGLY, the
bookstore, and Tresidder Union,
96 percent were locked. Either
one wheel was locked in position,
or the entire vehicle was fastened
in some way to a post or bike
rack.
