Syria To Join UAR
DAMASCUS, Syria — Syria's new revolutionary
government announced Monday it would seek to join
the proposed Arab federation of Egypt, Libya and
Sudan—restoring in part the 1958 United Arab Republic
of Gamal Abdul Nasser.
The old Syrian-Egyptian merger collapsed in
September 1961 after existing mostly on paper.
The announcement of the Syrian plan was made by
Radio Damascus in the name of the new leader, Gen.
Hafez Assad, the air marshal and defense minister who
seized power on Friday. It followed a government
shakeup in Sudan and a report of new fighting in Jordan.
Hours before the Syrian announcement, the
Palestinian guerrilla organization A 1 Fatah charged that
Jordanian army patrols staged day-long raids Monday in
Irbid near the Syrian border and killed or wounded 35
persons.
The guerrillas accused the Jordan army of violating
the cease-fire agreement that ended the September
fighting.
There were reports of a government shakeup in
Sudan, which agreed Nov. 9 to the federation plan with
Egypt and Libya. The Sudan development followed a
Cabinet resignation in Egypt.
Another political development indicated that Israel is
easing up on its insistence on the withdrawal of
Egyptian missiles from the Suez Canal area as a
condition for an Israeli return to peace talks in New
York.
Premier Golda Meir told the Knesset, Israel's
parliament in Jerusalem, that her government would
settle for less than a total rollback of the missiles.
She said she never allowed herself to bank on
obtaining full compliance by the Egyptians.
My Lai Jury Picked
FT. BENNING, Ga. - Jury selection for the court
martial of Lt. William L. Calley Jr. charged with the
premeditated murder of 102 Vietnamese civilians at My
Lai 32 months ago, was completed Monday, with final
defense and prosecution agreement on six jurors.
The six-ranging in rank from captain to
colonel—include five combat veterans of Vietnam.
Witnesses in the case were scheduled to begin
testimony today.

Calley, 27, led a platoon sweep through My Lai on
March 16,1968. The government charges that during the
course of the operation unarmed men, women and
children were slaughtered indiscriminately by Calley and
his men. If convicted on the premeditated murder
charges, Calley faces death or life imprisonment.
The defense is expected to contend that any action
Calley took at My Lai was on orders from his superiors
who had reason to believe the villagers were either Viet
Cong or Viet Cong sympathizers in civilian garb.
Seale Trial Begins
NEW HAVEN, Conn. -- The trial of Black Panther party
chairman Bobby G. Seale and codefendant Ericka
Huggins on capital charges begins today with jury
selection expected to take at least a month.
Seale, 34-year-old cofounder of the Panthers, and
Mrs. Huggins, 23, widow of a slain Panther organizer,
face a variety of charges in Superior Court in connection
with the May 1969 slaying of another Panther member,
Alex Rack ley.
State's Atty. Arnold Markle and attorneys for the
two defendants begin the lengthy process of selecting a
12-member jury Tuesday in a courtroom with
bulletproof glass windows and in a courthouse under
2 4 -hour guard by state police.
