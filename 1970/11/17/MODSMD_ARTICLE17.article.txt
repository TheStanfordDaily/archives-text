# Elections Delayed, Completed

What is the big delay in the ASSU
Senate elections? The second election
was held a month ago, yet no one
knows who won.
The reason for the long wait is that
overseas results have not yet bO>n sent
back, according to Elections
Commissioner Chris Banks. Although
the packets of votes from the campuses
in Germany, Italy, and France have
come, those from Austria and Britain
have not. Until all results are in, the
ballots are not transferred to computer
cards for counting. -
Part of the problem is that the
voting forms were sent overseas with
insufficient postage shortly after ASSU
Election Day here. They had to be

remailed, thereby delaying the election
procedure.
Since the ballots from other
campuses have started to arrive, Banks
says he is beginning the process of
transferring them to computer cards.
He now hopes to release the election
results later this week.
In a campus wide election held last
week, the yell leading squad consisting
of Garry Peters, Ray Parks, Mike
Quinn, Doug Peart, and Bob
Tomlinson, also known as "4+l" have
emerged the victors. "4+l" will occupy
the yell leading position from this
coming basketball season until next.
Only 374 students voted in the
election and the winners received 24 6
votes.
