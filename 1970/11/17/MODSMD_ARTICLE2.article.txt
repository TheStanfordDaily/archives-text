# SRI Officials Claim Neutrality While Radicals Cite War Research
## 
### FRED MANN Last of a Series 
On October 13, 1968, Rudolph K.
Brunsvold, a vice president of the
Stanford Research Institute told the
Daily in an interview, "As an
institution, we don't take a view on the
Tightness or wrongness of a
government."
The position was the perfectly
stated antithesis of the spring quarter
protesters'. Those urgently concerned
with the moral stance of SRI and its
work for government and big business
contractors hoped to force the
organization to re-evaluate its
principles. Confrontations with police
and attempts to stop "business as
usual" were overt instances of critics
trying to pressure administrators,
workers, and the controlling University
to alter SRl's "amoral character."
Yet the result of the crisis and
confrontations was the separation of
the institute from the University, and
the loss of direct student influence over
the actions of SRI.
And last week, Brunsvold reaffirmed
SRl's position on moral judgments of
the corporation.
"We (SRI) are a government agency,
set up by law," he said. "We have a
mission defined by Congress. We don't
question the legality or morality of
research projects.
"When you get into the question of
morality, you have to decide whose
moral guidelines to go by. Who is the
judge?"
Controversial Projects
SRI media relations director Ronald
I. Deutsch remarked that the institute
is "not unaware of our research being
considered controversial by some
people," but stated SRI will not back
away from controversial items.
"Controversial hardly describes
SRI," said Lenny Siegel of the New
Left Project. "SRl's work is as bad as it
ever was," he said. "The

demonstrations hurt them. They were
embarrassed and some workers left the
institute for political reasons, but now
they have recovered. They lay out
contingencies for limited war in Asia,
and do feasability studies for military
projects all over the third world. They
also deny doing counterinsurgency
work in Thailand, but that's „
understandable. They always lie."
Targets of the most radical ire are
projects that they clsv-m are covered up
by layers of publicly acceptable
research. One such example cited is the
International division, a "key
department in fete SRI program."

No Weight to Demands
SRI officials denied the legitimacy
of protestors demands two years ago,
and indicated that they would be
influenced by them even less this year,
if they were to be raised again. "The
SDS demands (of 1968 -69 ) had no
legitimacy because they were not
Stanford demands," said Brunsvold.
And now, even demands from the
University would not be binding.
The critics' demand for SRI to make
public all contracts is cited by
Brunsvold as unrealistic and impossible.
"We don't even have the option to
make the contracts public," he said.
"That is the business of our clients."
He summed up the SRI position
aptly saying, "We research business, not
morality."
Quiet Opposition
But those unhappy with such
guidelines remain adamant (although
quiet) in their opposition. The move to
the Menlo Park facility of William
Rambo's Systems Technique Lab and
both the Operations Analysis and

Operations Research Divisions (accused
by critics of harboring much of SRl's
counterinsurgency studies) have
increased the importance of SRI in the
eyes of radicals. More than ever, critics
feel, the gynstitute is a center of an
immoral, military-industrial research

Influence Inside
Joel Yudken of the New Left
Project added that the War Crimes
Trials will hopefully "encourage those

within to consider their work."
Although some radicals are
proclaiming a "major offensive" against
the institute to take place some time
this year, others believe that there will
be a number of actions, depending on
the amount of support, the weather,
and other variables.
But for many students, the
separation of the research firm and the
University signaled the end of deep
concern with the issue of "morality at
SRI." The organization no longer had
to answer to the University, and there
were no major changes in research
policy, current or contemplated.
Although any SRI researcher is free to
abstain from projects he feels are
morally or ethically wrong, few, if any,
have done so.
The institute continues to flourish,
in spite of its critics, and will enter the
new year a more efficient, united, and
financially successful corporation than
it was two years ago.
