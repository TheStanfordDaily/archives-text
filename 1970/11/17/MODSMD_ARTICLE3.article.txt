# Band Foils Attempted Axe Heist
## Radio Net Turns On 
### ED KOHN 
For a limited time, two police forces
are working at night on the University
campus. One is the normal, expected
group—the Stanford Police
Department, the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs and their friends.
But the other, at least for the time
being, is far more effective in its own
little bailiwick. It's larger. It doesn't
bother with the paperwork.

In The Car

And, though less conspicuous, it's
flashier.
Strangely enough, the groups are
basically independent. Their objectives,
though, are similar.
This "other" police force uses
ordinary civilian cars—Mercuries, Jeeps,
Fords and Chevys. They are equipped
with one piece of optional equipment
not available at the factory: a Citizens'
Band transceiver, coupled with, in some
cases, a police-band monitor.
Like the Stanford police, this
strange group is also guarding the
campus—but not against bicycle
thieves, petty rippoff artists, bombers
or murderers. More specifically, this
group, best known by its initials,
LSJUMB, is guarding against
students—adventuresome Cal
supporters seeking to steal the Axe and
paint the campus blue and gold.
And, judging by Sunday night's

action, the Band seems to meet with
unique success.

As I slouched in the compact car,
the Citizens' Band radio at my knee
squawked incessantly:
"Unit Five to Control."
"Control bye."
"The white Peugeot has entered the
Tresidder parking lot. California license
number ..
"Ten-Four."
I was unit seven for the evening,
stationed directly behind Tresidder,
across from the old firehouse. A Daily
photographer and I were sitting back,
listening, waiting for a band of Cal
raiders to swoop down and make off
with the Stanford Axe.
Glancing at his watch, the
photographer noted it was after one
a.m. and that we had been sitting there,
watching people go by, for more than
an hour.
"Let's go home," he suggested, and
we did.
"Unit Seven, ten-seven at the
Daily."
* * *
Only minutes later—advised not by a
calm voice on the radio but by a
slightly incredulous Daily reporter—I
was to go screaming back to that spot.
But it was too late: the Axe case had
been shattered and painting incidents
were being reported near Hoover
Tower.
The Band's tight security net had
failed—but only temporarily. Cars shot

out to all corners of the campus: to
Campus Drive and Escondido; over by
the UGLY; to the ROTC building; by
Tresidder; in all parking lots; down by
Hoover Tower (thought to be a prime
target for display of the Cal "C" in
bright yellow).
Such measures had to pay off
fast—and they did. All traffic moving
on campus was closely detailed, and
some of it was followed. People on foot
were stopped and asked to produce
University ID. Within minutes, seven
Cal students had been captured—the
majority by two Daily reporters—and
taken to the Stanford Police Station for
identification checks.
Night-long campus-wide surveillance
will continue from now until Big Game.
As the incidents last night
demonstrated. Big Game is just a crash
away. Or just a splash away.

being, is far more effective in its own
little bailiwick. It's larger. It doesn't
bother with the paperwork.

In The Car

And, though less conspicuous, it's
flashier.
Strangely enough, the groups are
basically independent. Their objectives,
though, are similar.
This "other" police force uses
ordinary civilian cars—Mercuries, Jeeps,
Fords and Chevys. They are equipped
with one piece of optional equipment
not available at the factory: a Citizens'
Band transceiver, coupled with, in some
cases, a police-band monitor.
Like the Stanford police, this
strange group is also guarding the
campus—but not against bicycle
thieves, petty rippoff artists, bombers
or murderers. More specifically, this
group, best known by its initials,
LSJUMB, is guarding against
students—adventuresome Cal
supporters seeking to steal the Axe and
paint the campus blue and gold.
And, judging by Sunday night's

action, the Band seems to meet with
unique success.

As I slouched in the compact car,
the Citizens' Band radio at my knee
squawked incessantly:
"Unit Five to Control."
"Control bye."
"The white Peugeot has entered the
Tresidder parking lot. California license
number ..
"Ten-Four."
I was unit seven for the evening,
stationed directly behind Tresidder,
across from the old firehouse. A Daily
photographer and I were sitting back,
listening, waiting for a band of Cal
raiders to swoop down and make off
with the Stanford Axe.
Glancing at his watch, the
photographer noted it was after one
a.m. and that we had been sitting there,
watching people go by, for more than
an hour.
"Let's go home," he suggested, and
we did.
"Unit Seven, ten-seven at the
Daily."

Only minutes later—advised not by a
calm voice on the radio but by a
slightly incredulous Daily reporter—I
was to go screaming back to that spot.
But it was too late: the Axe case had
been shattered and painting incidents
were being reported near Hoover
Tower.
The Band's tight security net had
failed—but only temporarily. Cars shot

out to all corners of the campus: to
Campus Drive and Escondido; over by
the UGLY; to the ROTC building; by
Tresidder; in all parking lots; down by
Hoover Tower (thought to be a prime
target for display of the Cal "C" in
bright yellow).
Such measures had to pay off
fast—and they did. All traffic moving
on campus was closely detailed, and
some of it was followed. People on foot
were stopped and asked to produce
University ID. Within minutes, seven
Cal students had been captured—the
majority by two Daily reporters—and
taken to the Stanford Police Station for
identification checks.
Night-long campus-wide surveillance
will continue from now until Big Game.
As the incidents last night
demonstrated. Big Game is just a crash
away. Or just a splash away.
Would you believe a tinkle?
For a limited time, two police forces
are working at night on the University
campus. One is the normal, expected
group—the Stanford Police
Department, the Santa Clara County
Sheriffs and their friends.
But the other, at least for the time
being, is far more effective in its own
little bailiwick. It's larger. It doesn't
