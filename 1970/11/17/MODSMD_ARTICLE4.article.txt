# Skulkers Nab Ursi

### FELICITY BARRINGER 
I'm not a good skulker. I just don't
sneak around very well. That was my
biggest problem Sunday night.
And, with all due respect to its
membership, the band wasn't a hell of a
lot better than I.
But we were outclassed by our
competition.
Cal was terrible.
It all started at 10:26 p.m. Sunday

On Foot

night, when the Daily received an
anonymous phone call, allegedly from a
resident of a Cal dorm. He said his
fellow dormmates were going out to
steal the Axe. He said he thought the
whole thing was silly, and his
dormmates were nerds anyway, but we
might like to know about it.
The Daily staff, tempted by the
prospect of irrelevance in the midst of
the Relevant Age, called over to the
band shack to let them know about the
purported raid.
Not knowing the extent of the
electronic and automotive cyclone they
had let loose on campus, the Daily
decided to send two cool, dispassionate
reporters to the scene, to get a
first-hand report of the ensuing action.
So 1 and an equally cool and
dispassionate colleague set out towards
Tresidder, leaves crunching loudly
under our feet.

"Do you hear something, Ralph?" I
asked.
"Yeah. Leaves," he answered, cooly
and dispassionately.
We arrived about ten minutes before
C-hour, when the blue-and-gold hordes
were supposed to descend. We cased
the joint—and discovered that we could
neither fit into the available trash cans,
nor climb any of the nearby trees—and
how in the world is one supposed to
skulk effectively if he can't fit into
trash cans and trees bend under his
weight?
Events proceeded at about the same
level of excitement, for another hour or
so, at which point, casting a discerning
eye around the area, I pronounced that
nothing was going to happen, so we had
better return to the office.
We did so, followed shortly by our
fellow-reporters, who had been staked
out in a car behind Tresidder.
Five minutes later, the glass case
covering the Axe was shattered by four
blows.
As the news reached the Daily
office, I tore back to Tresidder, to find
Ralph and a glum band member,
complete with walkie-talkie, staring at
the damaged case.
Suddenly his machine squawked.
"There's a whole bunch of them down
at the corner of the Old Union," a
static-laden voice called. "We need
help."
The band member raced out. toward
the Old Union.
Ralph raced after him.
I raced after Ralph.
Two cars started up near Ralph, and
wheeled out of the Tresidder parking
lot before he could get the license
numbers. As he came over to tell me,
we ran into three bewildered-looking
students.
"Did they steal the Axe?' the
students asked.
"No," we answered in unison. Then
we paused a minute. "What dorm are
you from?" Ralph asked.
"That one over there," one said,
pointing at the Bookstore.
Ralph and I looked at each other.
We looked at the three students. We
looked at each other again.
Then we asked them to come with
us, and escorted them to the first band
vehicle we could find.
Cooly and dispassionately.

We looked at the three students. We
looked at each other again.
Then we asked them to come with
us, and escorted them to the first band
vehicle we could find.
Cooly and dispassionately.

PSYCH DEDICATION—Resigning Berkeley Chancellor Roger Heyns and
President Lyman chat following the dedication of Jordan Hall as the new
Psychology offices. Heyns gave the keynote address at the dedication.
I'm not a good skulker. I just don't
sneak around very well. That was my
biggest problem Sunday night.
And, with all due respect to its
membership, the band wasn't a hell of a
lot better than I.
But we were outclassed by our
competition.
Cal was terrible.
It all started at 10:26 p.m. Sunday

On Foot

night, when the Daily received an
anonymous phone call, allegedly from a
resident of a Cal dorm. He said his
fellow dormmates were going out to
steal the Axe. He said he thought the
whole thing was silly, and his
dormmates were nerds anyway, but we
might like to know about it.
The Daily staff, tempted by the
prospect of irrelevance in the midst of
the Relevant Age, called over to the
band shack to let them know about the
purported raid.
Not knowing the extent of the
electronic and automotive cyclone they
had let loose on campus, the Daily
decided to send two cool, dispassionate
reporters to the scene, to get a
first-hand report of the ensuing action.
So 1 and an equally cool and
dispassionate colleague set out towards
Tresidder, leaves crunching loudly
under our feet.

"Do you hear something, Ralph?" I
asked.
"Yeah. Leaves," he answered, cooly
and dispassionately.
We arrived about ten minutes before
C-hour, when the blue-and-gold hordes
were supposed to descend. We cased
the joint—and discovered that we could
neither fit into the available trash cans,
nor climb any of the nearby trees—and
how in the world is one supposed to
skulk effectively if he can't fit into
trash cans and trees bend under his
weight?
Events proceeded at about the same
level of excitement, for another hour or
so, at which point, casting a discerning
eye around the area, I pronounced that
nothing was going to happen, so we had
better return to the office.
We did so, followed shortly by our
fellow-reporters, who had been staked
out in a car behind Tresidder.
Five minutes later, the glass case
covering the Axe was shattered by four
blows.
As the news reached the Daily
office, I tore back to Tresidder, to find
Ralph and a glum band member,
complete with walkie-talkie, staring at
the damaged case.
Suddenly his machine squawked.
"There's a whole bunch of them down
at the corner of the Old Union," a
static-laden voice called. "We need
help."
The band member raced out. toward
the Old Union.
Ralph raced after him.
I raced after Ralph.
Two cars started up near Ralph, and
wheeled out of the Tresidder parking
lot before he could get the license
numbers. As he came over to tell me,
we ran into three bewildered-looking
students.
"Did they steal the Axe?' the
students asked.
"No," we answered in unison. Then
we paused a minute. "What dorm are
you from?" Ralph asked.
"That one over there," one said,
pointing at the Bookstore.
Ralph and I looked at each other.
We looked at the three students. We
looked at each other again.
Then we asked them to come with
us, and escorted them to the first band
vehicle we could find.
