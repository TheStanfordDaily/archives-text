"That 'independent radical
weekly' the Guardian would take
a novel like A Separate Peace and
review it us a story of Gene, a boy
who becomes alienated from his
oppressive, authoritarian society.
In a burst of Funonistic rage, he
pushes Finny out of the tree,
epitomizing the slave killing his
master and his own slave ego.
Finny, however. forgives him,
another example of the system's
ability to utilize repressive
tolerance, and Gene becomes
co-opted and reconciled to the
destruction of Leper Lepellier by
the military industrial complex.

"You're a very dangerous
person. When the Revolution
comes, you will have to be
eliminated. "
"Undoubtedly."
—from a very unpublished manu
script.
This fall a lot of friends have

told me they got out of politics
because it dehumanizes people.
One reply to this could be that it
is inhuman to be apolitical and
stand by while the shit is coming
down everywhere. We cannot
afford the luxury of dropping out
of the Movement when the stakes
are so high. This would not be a
bad reply. It would be short and
simple, and consequently would
probably be printed in the Daily.
But there is some validity
behind this allegation. There is a
noticeable growing rigidification,
narrowness, and humorlessness, a
"socialist realism," that comes
across in the rhetoric of left rallies
and publications like the Guardian
mentioned above.
When a radical friend of mine
challenges me with: "I think that
the Free You is much better
literature than Shakespeare," I
first try to beg off the
comparison, but if I'm
concerned you know, the mass
line finishes second.
Many Sides
It is so important to see the
many-sidedness of things and to
have a sense of humor. Joni
Mitchell's songs are very
indulgent, but they're beautiful. I
don't think she should be hauled
before a People's Tribunal for
self-criticism. Monet's pictures of
bourgeois pleasures are not the
experience of the working class of
America or of the French
proletariat contemporary with
him, but the man does such
incredible things with light. And
nobody's going to tell me James
Joyce is no good. If you say
Ulysses is too arcane for the
working man, you'd have to say
the same thing about folk poet
Bob Dylan's "Desolation Row."
This is not to say that art
should be studied outside its
social and political context or that
art should not have a political
role. I like Weiss's Marat Sade
because it has more than a
monochromatic view of
revolution. The poor shout, "We
want our rights and we don't care
how. . but there is that line
"Once we thought a few hundred

corpses would be enough. Then
we saw thousands would be too
few." There is the poet who joins
the revolution because he writes
bad verse, but when it is over, his
poems are still bad. And then
there is the Napoleon that
follows. And yet it is
revolutionary drama.
Brecht's "Those who take meat
from the table, teach
contentment. . ~" on the other
hand, just does not make it.
Literature is not necessarily good
because it is political.
Politics Icky?
"Oh, 1 think politics are icky,"
movement drop-outs say. "Don't
be so political." No. Our politics
should pervade our lives. But it
must be the right kind of politics.
If a guy is against imperialism,
racism, capitalism, but is
exploitative in his relations with
women, you don't say his politics
are good, but his personal life is
screwed up. You say his politics
are bad. I would go further.
Someone who is against all the
economic injustices of the world,
but doesn't have time to listen to
his roomate's problems or who
laughs only at jokes about offing
trustees has bad politics.
One can easily link up talking
down to people at the dinner
table, being indifferent to other
people's love crises, making jokes
only about the faculty's sexual
potency, and having a narrowness
of interests, with the type of
politics that is for one-party rule,
that defines all morality in terms
of the class truggle, that views
violence not as a sometimes
necessary tool, but as an act of
self-liberation, or that has gotten
over those "bourgeois hangups"
about the Stalin purges.
What about the guy who has a
radical analysis, is reasonably
considerate of his immediatee
associates, but always talks only
about the political economy?
Even he has bad politics. What are
we talking about, anyway? In
order to build a truly human
society, we must deal with all
aspects of human life.

Marx and Mao are important.
But Tom Paine and the Populists
are important, too. Bill Cosby is
important. Dylan Thomas
belligerent through the pubs is
important. Einstein and rotating
frames are important. Peter Snell
snapping the tape in 3:5 4.4 is
important. A perfectly angled
volley that hits right where the
green and white meet and spins
away is important. (1 know black
auto workers usually don't have
access to tennis, but that doesn't

make tennis bad. I played tennis
at lunch hour with machinist:- last
summer.) Long runs until you are
exhausted and collapse all sweaty
in the grass are important. Weird
rings around the moon at
midnight Friday the Thirteenth
are important. Embracing
someone for no good reason is
important.
But socialist realism is so
unreal.
