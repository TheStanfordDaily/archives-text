### 
ticket war
Editor, The DAILY:
Wednesday November 18 will
be a day of chaos and lost time
for a large proportion of the

Stanford student body owing to
the decision by a group of
committees to allocate only
1 1,000 Rose Bowl tickets to the
12,566 registered students. Long
and unnecessary queues of

students anxious to avoid missing
a ticket will be generated.
The waste could be avoided by
alloting every student who wanted
one a ticket, and by having sales
times staggered by surname

alphabetical order as at
registration. Even if 100 percent
of the student body bought
tickets, this would only require 1 4
percent more tickets for students
than the current allocation. In
practice purchases would be
somewhat less than 100 percent
and the number of extra tickets
required would be
correspondingly lower.
Many of the students' spouses
have been avid rooters through
the season, and are now told that
there are no Rose Bowl tickets for
them. Besides being rooters, many
of the spouses are extensive
contributors to Stanford finances
through the tuition they pay for
their students. Why is there no
allocation of student spouse
tickets?
Stanford's total ticket supply is
38 ,000. Why is the student ration
so limited? To whom are the
remaining 2 7,000 tickets being
allocated. The committees owe us
an accounting and an explanation
of the reasons for their
allocations.
