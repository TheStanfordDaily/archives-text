# Stanford Museum: A Trip And A Half
##

One mummified hand.
One mummified foot.
One mummified alligator.
The ingredients of a potion to
turn your girlfriend into a frog?
No. These items are part of a
tasteful souvenir collection which
Leland Stanford Jr. put together
at age eleven while traveling
through Europe with his parents.
The collection is but one of the
wide and oftentimes strange
assortment of exhibits to be
found in the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum, which iscertianly
worth a visit, even if you don't
have to write an article on it.
Perhaps when you arrive at the
museum, located near the
chemistry building, you will
wonder why there are all those

sheep in the front yard. This is
because you have gone to the
anatomy building by mistake. The
museum is behind you.
The museum is staffed by forty
volunteer guides, or to use
museum language, docents, who
give tours which are incredibly
interesting for an art museum. For
instance, you probably did not
know that when the museum was
constructed, Leland Sr. had a few
rails and ties left over from the
railroad which he placed in the
walls creating the first building of
reinforced concrete. You also
probably don't know the
difference between how Chinese
painters and Western painters
treat space. How did you get into
Stanford anyhow?
At any rate, one phone call to
the museum to arrange a tour can
remedy at least some of your

cultural malnutrition in a very
enjoyable manner, and unlike
your usual day at Stanford, you
may actually have the feeling that
you've learned something.
The first floor of the museum
contains European and Chinese
art and a beautiful jade collection.
Another room contains ancient
Mediterranean art, such as Greek
vases and Egyptian sculpture. Also
there is an Egyptian mummy, if
that's your thing.
Art Collection
An excellent collection of
modern art is upstairs as well as a
room containing primitive art,
such as Kundu drums from the
Abe lam tribe of the Sepik river
region in New Guinea, a Hurok
canoe, fertility fetishes, and
Muprik Gwalndu, whatever they
are. There ere also some wooden
masks from Africa, one of which
has two faces carved on it,
probably for the local tribal
politician. If you're a Kundu drum
freak, like fertility fetishes, or
enjoy a good wooden mask every
now and then, this room is a must
for you.
Finally, returning to the first
floor, there is an exhibit on the
Stanford family which you will
soon discover is in no way as
boring as it sounds. Along the
hallway leading into the first
room of the exhibit are old
photographs of the museum
before and after the 190 6
earthquake. Included among the
photos is the famous old favorite,
"John Hayes Planting a Tree in
Front of the Museum."
The next room contains a wide
variety of Stanford memorabilia,
probably a lot wider variety than
you really wanted to see, but you
might enjoy looking at Mrs.
Stanford's wardrobe, a citation
naming her an honorary regent in
the Daughters of the American

Revolution, or an invitation to
Grover Cleveland's wedding.
On the wall are portraits of the
Stanfords and more old photos,
such as a rare one of budding
capitalist Leland Stanford. Sr., in
front of his first store in Michigan
Bluff, California.
By far the most important
artifact in the room is the golden
spike which was driven on May
10, 1869, to complete the first
transcontinental railroad.
Playroom
Adjoining the room of
Stanford memorabilia is Leland's
playroom, containing the famous
European souvenir collection.
Apparently when he went to
Europe, the museum tells us,
"young Leland conceived the idea
of bringing away from each place
some object of local or historical
interest." But later little Leland's
plans broadened and"he was
ambitious to make a collection
that might furnish his playroom at
home."
The result was a collection of
objects which has to be seen not to
be believed.
Aside from the mummified
limbs and alligators, the room
contains stuffed owls, a stone
from the foot of the Paris obelisk,
the corner of a stove from the
kitchen of Charles Martel at
Salzburg Castle, a check signed by
George Washington, and confetti
thrown to Leland by the crown
prince of Italy at a carnival. Yet
these are but a small portion of
the items in a room which
obviously is pretty hard to
summarize, but if you've always
been wondering what Charles
Martel's stove looked like, or if
you've always wanted to see some
real Italian confetti, this is the
room for you.
The playroom also contains
some beautiful Turkish water

pipes, and conveniently located in
a case far from the pipes, a jar of
brown herb-like substance which
looks suspiciously like nutmeg
and which Leland had labeled
"Egyptian Tomb Weed."
Far be it from me to comment
on the morality of ripping off
some dead Egyptian's grass, but
some Pharaoh's afterlife certainly
must have been a bummer.
In any case, most of the
exhibits in the museum are
certainly worth the trip, and as in
this case, may actually be open.


CALIFORNIA DREAMIN'â€”Young Leland Stanford was a lad with
great foresight. Somehow he know, way back then, that this Turkish
water pipe would be one souvenir that would retain its fascination for
generations to come.
