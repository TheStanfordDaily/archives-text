Today In The 'Daily'
On this date in the year of our Lord 1936, Italy and
Germany recognized the Franco government in Spain. The
Spanish civil war between Franco's nationalists and the
supporters of the Republic—from liberals to communists and
anarchists—was a prologue to the later European war. Now
Spain is run by Opus Dei technocrats, and Franco is arranging
for a smooth transition when he leaves the scene.
