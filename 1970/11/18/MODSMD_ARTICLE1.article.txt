# Fewer Women Students Admitted To University Graduate Divisions
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
The outlook for women wishing
admission to graduate schools here has
grown bleaker over the past few years,
statistical studies show.
This trend is opposite to the increase
in women students suggested 18
months ago in the SES report on the
Education of Women, part of the
Report on Graduate Education.
According to the Registrar's figures,
the ratio of men to women in the

graduate schools last year was five to
one, higher than it has been any time in
the past 10 years. Ten years ago it
stood at four to one.
Perhaps the most significant aspect
of the admission picture for graduate
women is that the ratio of men to
women has increased as the total
number of graduate students has
declined.
Smaller Fraction
In 1969, for example, one out of
every 2.5 male applicants was accepted,
whereas only one out of every 3.9
female applicants got in.
In 1970 one out of every 2.8 men
got in; for women the fraction jumped
to one out of every 4.7 applicants. (All
of these figures exclude the three
professional schools.)
The process of admitting graduate
students is a complex one, according to
Lincoln Moses, Dean of the Graduate
Division.
The number of students admitted to
each department depends primarily on
the amount of financial aid available
for that department, since most
graduate students must be guaranteed
four years of financial support.
Some departments, such as
engineering, have their own endowment
and research grants to finance graduate
students. Other departments must rely
primarily on University funds.
Individual Committees
Committees of each department
consider the applications and decide
who to admit. Since there is no central
organization of graduate admissions it
is almost impossible to have a clear
policy on such matters as the admission
of women, according to Dean Moses.
Thus in the last few years, the only
central decision has been that there

shall be fewer graduate students. It is
apparently the departments which have
decided that the excluded graduate
students shall be women.
The size of the graduate enrollment
is likely to decrease still further in the
near future, according to Moses. One
cause is the financial pinch. Another
reason is that many departments, such
as physics, have voluntarily reduced the
size of their graduate division because
of the current over-supply of PhD's.
Virtual Autonomy
Since departments have virtual
autonomy on admissions, no one can
really discuss the admission of women
in terms of more than one department.
One history' professor said, "I have seen
blatant discrimination against women
in some of the discussions of applicants

in my department. I don't know about
the others."
Dean Moses states, "In my
department, which is statistics, I think
some discrimination exists in
admissions. I have no way of knowing
about the others."
Moses feels that there are usually
two reasons given for excluding
women. One is that they will not be
able to contribute as much time to
their professional life, and therefore it
is a waste to train them as researchers.
The second is that women will drop out
and get married before they have
completed their PhD. He stated that he
has seen no good evidence to either
support or refute these opinions.

There are several reasons which
partially explain the declining
enrollment of women in the graduate
division, according to Moses. One is
that the size of the School of
Education, which enrolls a relatively
large number of women, has been cut.
Another is that the Masters program
has been de-emphasized in most
departments.
In addition, many departments do
not like to take older students as PhD
candidates. This policy can discriminate
against the woman who has spent
several years raising children and then
wishes to return to complete her
education.
Moses states that the University has
done little for older women who wish

to return to graduate school, although
other universities have found that they
make fine students. He added, "Any
mature woman wishing to return to
graduate school on a part-time basis
would have support from me. I think if
we could help these women, we would
have done a lot." He feels that such
women could finance their education
by becoming part-time students.
At the present time, most women
graduate students are clustered in a few
departments. Departments having a
female majority are: anthropology,
linguistics, nursing, and some of the
languages. All other departments have a
male majority, which sometimes can
reach such astronomical proportions as
exist in the School of Engineering,
where the graduate ratio last year was
70 to 1.

graduate schools last year was five to
one, higher than it has been any time in
the past 10 years. Ten years ago it
stood at four to one.
Perhaps the most significant aspect
of the admission picture for graduate
women is that the ratio of men to
women has increased as the total
number of graduate students has
declined.
Smaller Fraction
In 1969, for example, one out of
every 2.5 male applicants was accepted,
whereas only one out of every 3.9
female applicants got in.
In 1970 one out of every 2.8 men
got in; for women the fraction jumped
to one out of every 4.7 applicants. (All
of these figures exclude the three
professional schools.)
The process of admitting graduate
students is a complex one, according to
Lincoln Moses, Dean of the Graduate
Division.
The number of students admitted to
each department depends primarily on
the amount of financial aid available
for that department, since most
graduate students must be guaranteed
four years of financial support.
Some departments, such as
engineering, have their own endowment
and research grants to finance graduate
students. Other departments must rely
primarily on University funds.
Individual Committees
Committees of each department
consider the applications and decide
who to admit. Since there is no central
organization of graduate admissions it
is almost impossible to have a clear
policy on such matters as the admission
of women, according to Dean Moses.
Thus in the last few years, the only
central decision has been that there

shall be fewer graduate students. It is
apparently the departments which have
decided that the excluded graduate
students shall be women.
The size of the graduate enrollment
is likely to decrease still further in the
near future, according to Moses. One
cause is the financial pinch. Another
reason is that many departments, such
as physics, have voluntarily reduced the
size of their graduate division because
of the current over-supply of PhD's.
Virtual Autonomy
Since departments have virtual
autonomy on admissions, no one can
really discuss the admission of women
in terms of more than one department.
One history' professor said, "I have seen
blatant discrimination against women
in some of the discussions of applicants

in my department. I don't know about
the others."
Dean Moses states, "In my
department, which is statistics, I think
some discrimination exists in
admissions. I have no way of knowing
about the others."
Moses feels that there are usually
two reasons given for excluding
women. One is that they will not be
able to contribute as much time to
their professional life, and therefore it
is a waste to train them as researchers.
The second is that women will drop out
and get married before they have
completed their PhD. He stated that he
has seen no good evidence to either
support or refute these opinions.

There are several reasons which
partially explain the declining
enrollment of women in the graduate
division, according to Moses. One is
that the size of the School of
Education, which enrolls a relatively
large number of women, has been cut.
Another is that the Masters program
has been de-emphasized in most
departments.
In addition, many departments do
not like to take older students as PhD
candidates. This policy can discriminate
against the woman who has spent
several years raising children and then
wishes to return to complete her
education.
Moses states that the University has
done little for older women who wish

to return to graduate school, although
other universities have found that they
make fine students. He added, "Any
mature woman wishing to return to
graduate school on a part-time basis
would have support from me. I think if
we could help these women, we would
have done a lot." He feels that such
women could finance their education
by becoming part-time students.
At the present time, most women
graduate students are clustered in a few
departments. Departments having a
female majority are: anthropology,
linguistics, nursing, and some of the
languages. All other departments have a
male majority, which sometimes can
reach such astronomical proportions as
exist in the School of Engineering,
where the graduate ratio last year was
70 to 1.
The outlook for women wishing
admission to graduate schools here has
grown bleaker over the past few years,
statistical studies show.
This trend is opposite to the increase
in women students suggested 18
months ago in the SES report on the
Education of Women, part of the
Report on Graduate Education.
