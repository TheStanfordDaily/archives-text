# I-Center Establishes Pakistan Relief Fund
## 
### 
The community of
international students has
established an East Pakistan Relief
Fund Committee to assist the
victims of the cyclone and tidal
wave which recently sstruck
Pakistan.
The committee is soliciting
contributions to the fund from
the University community.
The worst disaster in Pakistani
history, the cyclone and tidal
wave which hit the southern coast
of East Pakistan on November 13
left hundreds of thousands of

persons homeless and may have
killed as many as 300,000
persons. Unofficial death
estimates place the number of
deaths at one million. Some major
islands were left without a
survivor and the damage to crops
and livestock is inestimable.
Recent news indicates that
widespread cholera has broken
out in the devastated area.
Community members who
wish to contribute to the relief
fund should contact the East
Pakistan Relief Fund Committee,
International Center.

about the band's football game canon. At the last home game the gun
fired accidentally, injuring one student who was attempting to reload
it.
