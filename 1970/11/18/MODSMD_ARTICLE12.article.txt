# Modified Cannon Set For Big Game
## 
### 
It will be a modified version of
the Stanford cannon which will be
firing, hopefully quite often, this
Saturday in Berkeley and New
Year's Day in Pasadena.
Santa Clara Fire Marshal
Monday banned use of the Leland
Stanford Junior University
Marching Band's artillery piece in
its present muzzle-loading form.
"We will not allow them to use
the cannon ... in the manner in
which it is being used now. We
will not allow it to continue as a
muzzle loading operation," said
Fire Marshal Baker.
Baker's decision came at the
end of a nine-day investigation
into the cannon after a misfire at
the Stanford-Washington game
injured two of the piece's firing
crew.
Stanford bandsnu.. and the
two injured cannoneers were
upset with Baker's decision.
Although Band Manager Ken
Peterson claimed that whatever
adjustments were necessary would
be made to use the cannon at
Berkeley and in Pasadena, he
expressed discontent with the idea
of making such adjustments
permanent.
Injured cannoneer Rick
Leicher pointed out that the
reason for the misfire at the
Washington game was that

compressed air had been used to
cool off the cannon before
reloading. The air, claims Leicher,
had kept alive a spark which
ignited the new charge when it
was ramrodded in.
A new procedure has since
been developed which uses carbon
dioxide as a cooler. The carbon
dioxide extinguishes any flames.
This procedure was used in a
Monday afternoon test-firing
before a deputy fire marshal, a
representative from the state fire
marshal's office, University
firemen, the band, and assorted
spectators.
There are three possible
alternatives. The cannon can be
changed so that it loads at the
breech, that is, in the rear. The
muzzle can be fitted with a steel
insert which would contain a
prepackaged charge to be 9et off
electrically. Or the band could get
a new cannon.
Baker recommended the
second suggestion. "The band can
achieve the visual and audible
effects that they want in a much
safer manner, without putting a
projectile down the barrel."
Baker added that the
authorities who have jurisdiction
in Berkeley and Pasadena agreed
with his decision.
