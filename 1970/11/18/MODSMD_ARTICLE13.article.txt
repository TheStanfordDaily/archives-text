# Homestyle Beer Bar?
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Unless you keep piles of
sawdust on your livingroom floor,
MOM'S will probably not remind
you much of home—but you
might like the atmosphere
anyway. Located on University
and High in Palo Alto in the
building which houses the Full
Circle and used to house the now
defunct Poppycock, Mom's has
been engineered as a place where
anyone can come and have fun (if
they are over 21).
Peter Mair and Jim
Rummonds, two third year
Stanford law students are the
parents of Mom's. For several
years the friends had the idea of
establishing a club where all kinds
of people ranging from the
businessman to the student could
go for food, beer, and fun.
Although they hadn't originally
planned to set up shop in Palo
Alto, they took advantage of the
closing of the Poppycock earlier
this year and located there.

Pete and Jim mustered their
legal training in establishing a
corporation and then attempting
to acquire a beer license. The
license took over six months to
obtain but was finally gotten with
great perseverance and help from
some prominent Palo Alto
citizens. They were able to open
their doors early this quarter.
The duo called on a long time
friend, Brent Sellstrom, to act as
full time manager and take care of
the club while they were
attending school and helping with
the club. Brent spoke about
Mom's and related, "Mom's is
different from other places
around here. It is apolitical unlike
the Full Circle next door which
has definite ideological leanings,
and it is not as commercial as the
Round Table. We want people to
feel very unpressured here." Brent
told that he felt the failing of the
Poppycock was that it wasn't run
like a business. He added that
Mom's will be run like a business
because "we are in business."
The decor and design of the
club relates a few of the ways that
people can divert themselves
there. The entranceway houses a
bar and grill which serves up
hamburgers, hot dogs, "Louisiana
Hot" polish sausage, pastrami,

sandwiches, and a variety of beers.
The food is good and the prices
reasonable. Past the entrance are a
few rows of tables which open up
into Mom's Grand Ballroom.
There is a dancefloor and a
bandstand which hosts Fast Eddy
and the Sheiks and Rocking Ricky
Zumbo and His Miracle
Restoration Revival Band. The
groups play on alternate nights.
Rocking Ricky plays in the
Sha-Na-Na tradition and the
dancefloor fills up with couples
doing the bop and the jitterbug.
Fast Eddy concentrates more on
contemporary rock music rather
than the oldies.
The walls of the ballroom are
graced with two very distinctive
thirty foot long murals. On one
wall, a mural painted by Bill
Jameson is a collection of
Picasso-like faces in a crowd.
After a few feet of the mural had
been painted, Brent commented
that the faces should be happier.
Look at the painting and you will
notice the faces get cheerier as
you walk from left to right.
On the opposite wall a mural
portrays what will happen when
pollution finally disturbs the
cosmic balance of the universe.
The icecaps will melt and a wave

will hurtle down across the earth
sweeping up everything in its path
and uncovering lost civilizations
of dinosaurs.
While all this is going on,
people are sitting at the bar and
drinking beer—Mom's bar of
course. Owner Jim Rummonds is a
member of the President's
Commission on Population in the
American Future and the mural
reflects some of his thoughts on
ecocatastrophe as well as those of
the artist. The mural is
eyecatching when you walk in and
gets more interesting with each
pitcher.
The game room at the back of
the club is sort of a grown-up's
Disneyland. There is a pool table,
a foosball table, a shuffleboard
table, pinball games, and even a
W.C. Fields film peepshow. The
walls are covered with a painting
of the Stanford Indians trouncing
an opponent, done in charicature.
It is possible to see a large part of
the football team at Mom's since
Bob Moore, Jack Lasiter, Jack
Schultz, Mike Simone, and Ron
Kadziel are all employed there,
possibly one reason why barroom
brawls are at a bare minimum.

great perseverance and help from
some prominent Palo Alto
citizens. They were able to open
their doors early this quarter.
The duo called on a long time
friend, Brent Sellstrom, to act as
full time manager and take care of
the club while they were
attending school and helping with
the club. Brent spoke about
Mom's and related, "Mom's is
different from other places
around here. It is apolitical unlike
the Full Circle next door which
has definite ideological leanings,
and it is not as commercial as the
Round Table. We want people to
feel very unpressured here." Brent
told that he felt the failing of the
Poppycock was that it wasn't run
like a business. He added that
Mom's will be run like a business
because "we are in business."
The decor and design of the
club relates a few of the ways that
people can divert themselves
there. The entranceway houses a
bar and grill which serves up
hamburgers, hot dogs, "Louisiana
Hot" polish sausage, pastrami,

sandwiches, and a variety of beers.
The food is good and the prices
reasonable. Past the entrance are a
few rows of tables which open up
into Mom's Grand Ballroom.
There is a dancefloor and a
bandstand which hosts Fast Eddy
and the Sheiks and Rocking Ricky
Zumbo and His Miracle
Restoration Revival Band. The
groups play on alternate nights.
Rocking Ricky plays in the
Sha-Na-Na tradition and the
dancefloor fills up with couples
doing the bop and the jitterbug.
Fast Eddy concentrates more on
contemporary rock music rather
than the oldies.
The walls of the ballroom are
graced with two very distinctive
thirty foot long murals. On one
wall, a mural painted by Bill
Jameson is a collection of
Picasso-like faces in a crowd.
After a few feet of the mural had
been painted, Brent commented
that the faces should be happier.
Look at the painting and you will
notice the faces get cheerier as
you walk from left to right.
On the opposite wall a mural
portrays what will happen when
pollution finally disturbs the
cosmic balance of the universe.
The icecaps will melt and a wave

will hurtle down across the earth
sweeping up everything in its path
and uncovering lost civilizations
of dinosaurs.
While all this is going on,
people are sitting at the bar and
drinking beer—Mom's bar of
course. Owner Jim Rummonds is a
member of the President's
Commission on Population in the
American Future and the mural
reflects some of his thoughts on
ecocatastrophe as well as those of
the artist. The mural is
eyecatching when you walk in and
gets more interesting with each
pitcher.
The game room at the back of
the club is sort of a grown-up's
Disneyland. There is a pool table,
a foosball table, a shuffleboard
table, pinball games, and even a
W.C. Fields film peepshow. The
walls are covered with a painting
of the Stanford Indians trouncing
an opponent, done in charicature.
It is possible to see a large part of
the football team at Mom's since
Bob Moore, Jack Lasiter, Jack
Schultz, Mike Simone, and Ron
Kadziel are all employed there,
possibly one reason why barroom
brawls are at a bare minimum.

Unless you keep piles of
sawdust on your livingroom floor,
MOM'S will probably not remind
you much of home—but you
might like the atmosphere
anyway. Located on University
and High in Palo Alto in the
building which houses the Full
Circle and used to house the now
defunct Poppycock, Mom's has
been engineered as a place where
anyone can come and have fun (if
they are over 21).
Peter Mair and Jim
Rummonds, two third year
Stanford law students are the
parents of Mom's. For several
years the friends had the idea of
establishing a club where all kinds
of people ranging from the
businessman to the student could
go for food, beer, and fun.
Although they hadn't originally
planned to set up shop in Palo
Alto, they took advantage of the
closing of the Poppycock earlier
this year and located there.

Pete and Jim mustered their
legal training in establishing a
corporation and then attempting
to acquire a beer license. The
license took over six months to
obtain but was finally gotten with
great perseverance and help from
some prominent Palo Alto
citizens. They were able to open
their doors early this quarter.
