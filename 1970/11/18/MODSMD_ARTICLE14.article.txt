# The
						King Returns

### CHARLES DOUTHAT 
It was the strangest of seenes.
15,000 of the straightest people
I've ever seen jammed the Cow
Palace Friday night to see Klvis
Presley. Though their average age
must have been 35, for this one
magic night they were kids again.
They squirmed their way through
the first two acts, then as the
lights went out after intermission
a collective shiver passed through
the crowd. The back-up band
broke into the first number, then
the man himself bounded up onto
the stage. Instantly the place
exploded. Flashbulbs threw waves
of light across the audience, and
for a few out-front seconds
screams drowned out the music.
Elvis was still King.
The first song was "That's All
Right," and in a flash you knew
that after 20 years Elvis still had
more soul than any man alive. He
shook his head, threw his arms
around, and went into his
spread-eagled crouch to let that
ass shake. His hair, long but
styled, fell across his face and he
flipped it up, strutting back and
forth across the stage.
The song ended and Elvis
threw off his guitar then slowed
the pace with "Love Me Tender."
Next, the Rightous Brothers' hit
"You've Lost that Lovin' Feeling,"
with the orchestra building a Phil
Spector wall of sound behind
Elvis. Then, as the audience
quieted for a moment a
middle-aged woman near the front
stood up and screamed, "Elvis I
love you. Fifteen years I've loved
you." Elvis laughed and the band
broke into an incredible rock 'n'
roll medley of "Polk Salad
Annie," "Johnny B. Goode,"
"Heartbreak Hotel," "Blue Suede
Shoes," and "Hound Dog."
The music was superb, Elvis'
voice strong above it, but 15,000
people hadn't paid to hear music,
they had come to see Him. And
he was no disappointment. He
danced, he squirmed, he fell on
his back. He paced back and
forth, milking the crowd of
emotion one second then putting

everyone on the next. He let his
white silk shirt fall open, threw
his scarf into the audience, and
just boogied for 30 minutes.
Finally Elvis brought everyone
back down with "Suspicious
Mind," "How Great Thou Art,"
and"I Can't Help Falling In Love
With You." Then the set was over
and Elvis waltzed off the stage.
Except for a few pleading screams
the audience was quiet, and
trooped out of the Cow Palace
after only brief applause. They
had gladly paid $10.50 a ticket to

see the King and were apparently
satisfied with 50 minutes of his
presence.
But for all these Americans
who had grown up in thes o's, it
was an evening of more than just
entertainment. A figure from their
past had returned and dared them
to ride with him just one more
time. Obviously he had changed
along with his audience, but his
power, at least for fifty minutes,
was enough to pull the rest behind
him. "Just don't step on my blue
suede shoes."


A casual snapshot
ALIVE AND KICKING—The man himself once again proved that the
5 o's still sells and that Americans still abhor subtlety. In his set Elvis
paid tribute to such all time greats as Chuck Berry, Phil Spector,
himself, and God.
