# Birth Of New American Myth
## 
### DAVID F. SCRANTON 
A new American myth has
been born—and Charles Reich
would be one of the midwives.
This new myth is held out for us
to examine in Reich's book, The
Greening of America. So popular
is the work, that it has been
excerpted in the September 26 th
issue of the "New Yorker," has
sold as fast as it could be supplied
to distributors, and is now already
in its second printing—all in the
space of two month.
Tremendous acceptance—or
rather attention—for a new book
has always made me immediately
suspicious of its worth. Often a
book, merely by having been
advertised in serendipitous ways,
is hailed as a great work before it's
been read by any but a tiny
fraction of the public. It seems
that a vicious circle can begin in
which some attention begets more
attention begets so much more
attention.
One of the features of our
media, including this newspaper,
magazines, television, and radio, is
their unique capability of
commenting precisely on what is
current, is popular, or

much-discussed. We have a filter
that habitually turns the element
"culture" into the compound
"mass-culture." What comes out
may or may not be what we were
searching for initially.
So it is with great reluctance
that I review this excerpt from
Reich's book. I know that my
mere mention of it may have ten
or twenty more people read the
thing, which will in turn create
more attention and, consequently,
acceptance of the work as
"amazing" or "extraordinary."
Timely it is; but whether it is
remarkable as a piece of
fact—which it purports to be—is
another question.
Non-Objectivp
The first section of the
excerpt, entitled "The Corporate
State," begins by presenting
several related, general
conclusions about today's
corporate society. Reich then tries
to demonstrate the truth of those
generalities by examining our
economic and political structures
in more detail. He bases much of
his reasoning on Galbraith's book,
The New Industrial State, and
upon many ideas that are almost
Marcusian.

But Reich's style should give us
warning: he is not demonstrating
objective fact, but recounting and
developing a new American myth.
He gives us no sources for his
"facts," talks basically in general
absolutes, resorts frequently to
near-hyperbole, and concentrates
on only one aspect of the
corporate society. Rather than
reach his most important
conclusion—that sense of
individuality and uniqueness and
personal worth have been
destroyed by the American
society—he begins with that
assumption. His presupposition
guides the whole article: it
determines what he will focus on
for criticism, what sources he will
use for support, and what
conclusions he will draw.
Note that he talks essentially
about systems and institutions
and laws, and hardly ever about
individuals. Such an approach
cannot but lead to a mechanistic,
inhuman view of his object. Never
does he recount the force of
individual action (in a
bureaucracy) towards
humanization and sensitivity. It
does, though, exist. His sources,
too are biased. Galbraith,
although a supreme economist
and visionary, tends in his writing
to be dogmatic and very
one-sided. To base another book
on Galbraith's caricatures is to
ground one's own work in myth,
and not in "scientific fact."
Notice, too, that despite all his
support for his general theses, his
"support" appears to be more a
detailing of those generalities than
an actual evidentiary
reinforcement for them. Again,
Reich is presenting and
perpetuating a new myth, and not
a (quote-unquote) balanced view.
However, having satisfied
ourselves that Reich is tracing a
mylh, could we perhaps judge it
within that context? Reich's
theses deplore scientific
objectivism that excludes
affections and spontanaeity.
Perhaps the greatest power the
myth has is not its grounding in
observable fact, but is its
existence as a myth, as a vehicle
for belief. Such power that a
myth has is precisely what Reich
finds so important in the new
generation. He says in the second
section, entitled "The New
Consciousness," that
What has happened now is that
the state had begun to do
things that reveal the falsity of
existing illusions and myths.
But Reich's approach to the
New Consciousness is almost as
inconsistent as his analysis of the
Corporate Slate. He tries to
systemitize this change in terms
of three Consciousnesses, almost

as if he could delimit objectively
this change in belief. In fact, he
almost forgets that he is tracing,
not characters or consciousness,
but ideals and myths as they
have developed and are
developing.
Patronizing?
Sometimes it is very hard to
know, also, whether Reich is
patronizing young people, or
whether he actually believes this
myth of the New Consciousness.
Often he is as hyperbolic in his
praise of youth's clothes and
music as he has been in criticizing
the old System and
Consciousness.
His argument becomes quite
original and creative when he
begins to describe what forms the
"revolution" will take:
No political revolution is
possible in the United States
right now, but no such
revolution is needed,
For it is a revolution by
consciousness, and
requires two basic conditions.
First, a process of change of
consciousness must be under
way in the population—a
process that promises to
continue until it reaches a
majority of the people.
Second, the existing order
must depend for its power on
an earlier consciousness, and
therefore be unable to survive a
change of consciousness. Both
of these conditions now exist
in the United States,
This will bring even a new type of
revolution:
. . .the way each individual
actually lives is political in the
most decisive sense of that
word. It is action in one's own
life that counts. When enough
people have decided to live
differently, the political results
will follow naturally and easily,
and the old political forms will
simply be swept away in the
flood.
Reich's thought becomes original
precisely because he releases
himself to his new myth and all its
potentialities. His is a warm vision
of the Apocalypse and whatever
he had lost in scientific
credibility, he makes up for in
sincerity and metaphorical
excitement.
The Greening of America is a
myth; but. as Reich himself says,
its power is its potential for
fruition in the minds of the
American people. Its power
depends on just those media that
popularize what is current. I read
it as scientific proposition and
finished dissatisified; I read it
again as poetry and enjoyed it
very much. 1 recommend that you
read it—but that you read it both
ways.

systemitize this change in terms
of three Consciousnesses, almost

as if he could delimit objectively
this change in belief. In fact, he
almost forgets that he is tracing,
not characters or consciousness,
but ideals and myths as they
have developed and are
developing.
Patronizing?
Sometimes it is very hard to
know, also, whether Reich is
patronizing young people, or
whether he actually believes this
myth of the New Consciousness.
Often he is as hyperbolic in his
praise of youth's clothes and
music as he has been in criticizing
the old System and
Consciousness.
His argument becomes quite
original and creative when he
begins to describe what forms the
"revolution" will take:
No political revolution is
possible in the United States
right now, but no such
revolution is needed,
For it is a revolution by
consciousness, and
requires two basic conditions.
First, a process of change of
consciousness must be under
way in the population—a
process that promises to
continue until it reaches a
majority of the people.
Second, the existing order
must depend for its power on
an earlier consciousness, and
therefore be unable to survive a
change of consciousness. Both
of these conditions now exist
in the United States,
This will bring even a new type of
revolution:
. . .the way each individual
actually lives is political in the
most decisive sense of that
word. It is action in one's own
life that counts. When enough
people have decided to live
differently, the political results
will follow naturally and easily,
and the old political forms will
simply be swept away in the
flood.
Reich's thought becomes original
precisely because he releases
himself to his new myth and all its
potentialities. His is a warm vision
of the Apocalypse and whatever
he had lost in scientific
credibility, he makes up for in
sincerity and metaphorical
excitement.
The Greening of America is a
myth; but. as Reich himself says,
its power is its potential for
fruition in the minds of the
American people. Its power
depends on just those media that
popularize what is current. I read
it as scientific proposition and
finished dissatisified; I read it
again as poetry and enjoyed it
very much. 1 recommend that you
read it—but that you read it both
ways.
A new American myth has
been born—and Charles Reich
would be one of the midwives.
This new myth is held out for us
to examine in Reich's book, The
Greening of America. So popular
is the work, that it has been
excerpted in the September 26 th
issue of the "New Yorker," has
sold as fast as it could be supplied
to distributors, and is now already
in its second printing—all in the
space of two month.
Tremendous acceptance—or
rather attention—for a new book
has always made me immediately
suspicious of its worth. Often a
book, merely by having been
advertised in serendipitous ways,
is hailed as a great work before it's
been read by any but a tiny
fraction of the public. It seems
that a vicious circle can begin in
which some attention begets more
attention begets so much more
attention.
One of the features of our
media, including this newspaper,
magazines, television, and radio, is
their unique capability of
commenting precisely on what is
current, is popular, or

much-discussed. We have a filter
that habitually turns the element
"culture" into the compound
"mass-culture." What comes out
may or may not be what we were
searching for initially.
So it is with great reluctance
that I review this excerpt from
Reich's book. I know that my
mere mention of it may have ten
or twenty more people read the
thing, which will in turn create
more attention and, consequently,
acceptance of the work as
"amazing" or "extraordinary."
Timely it is; but whether it is
remarkable as a piece of
fact—which it purports to be—is
another question.
Non-Objectivp
The first section of the
excerpt, entitled "The Corporate
State," begins by presenting
several related, general
conclusions about today's
corporate society. Reich then tries
to demonstrate the truth of those
generalities by examining our
economic and political structures
in more detail. He bases much of
his reasoning on Galbraith's book,
The New Industrial State, and
upon many ideas that are almost
Marcusian.

But Reich's style should give us
warning: he is not demonstrating
objective fact, but recounting and
developing a new American myth.
He gives us no sources for his
"facts," talks basically in general
absolutes, resorts frequently to
near-hyperbole, and concentrates
on only one aspect of the
corporate society. Rather than
reach his most important
conclusion—that sense of
individuality and uniqueness and
personal worth have been
destroyed by the American
society—he begins with that
assumption. His presupposition
guides the whole article: it
determines what he will focus on
for criticism, what sources he will
use for support, and what
conclusions he will draw.
Note that he talks essentially
about systems and institutions
and laws, and hardly ever about
individuals. Such an approach
cannot but lead to a mechanistic,
inhuman view of his object. Never
does he recount the force of
individual action (in a
bureaucracy) towards
humanization and sensitivity. It
does, though, exist. His sources,
too are biased. Galbraith,
although a supreme economist
and visionary, tends in his writing
to be dogmatic and very
one-sided. To base another book
on Galbraith's caricatures is to
ground one's own work in myth,
and not in "scientific fact."
Notice, too, that despite all his
support for his general theses, his
"support" appears to be more a
detailing of those generalities than
an actual evidentiary
reinforcement for them. Again,
Reich is presenting and
perpetuating a new myth, and not
a (quote-unquote) balanced view.
However, having satisfied
ourselves that Reich is tracing a
mylh, could we perhaps judge it
within that context? Reich's
theses deplore scientific
objectivism that excludes
affections and spontanaeity.
Perhaps the greatest power the
myth has is not its grounding in
observable fact, but is its
existence as a myth, as a vehicle
for belief. Such power that a
myth has is precisely what Reich
finds so important in the new
generation. He says in the second
section, entitled "The New
Consciousness," that
What has happened now is that
the state had begun to do
things that reveal the falsity of
existing illusions and myths.
But Reich's approach to the
New Consciousness is almost as
inconsistent as his analysis of the
Corporate Slate. He tries to
systemitize this change in terms
of three Consciousnesses, almost

as if he could delimit objectively

warning: he is not demonstrating
objective fact, but recounting and
developing a new American myth.
He gives us no sources for his
"facts," talks basically in general
absolutes, resorts frequently to
near-hyperbole, and concentrates
on only one aspect of the
corporate society. Rather than
reach his most important
conclusion—that sense of
individuality and uniqueness and
personal worth have been
destroyed by the American
society—he begins with that
assumption. His presupposition
guides the whole article: it
determines what he will focus on
for criticism, what sources he will
use for support, and what
conclusions he will draw.
Note that he talks essentially
about systems and institutions
and laws, and hardly ever about
individuals. Such an approach
cannot but lead to a mechanistic,
inhuman view of his object. Never
does he recount the force of
individual action (in a
bureaucracy) towards
humanization and sensitivity. It
does, though, exist. His sources,
too are biased. Galbraith,
although a supreme economist
and visionary, tends in his writing
to be dogmatic and very
one-sided. To base another book
on Galbraith's caricatures is to
ground one's own work in myth,
and not in "scientific fact."
Notice, too, that despite all his
support for his general theses, his
"support" appears to be more a
detailing of those generalities than
an actual evidentiary
reinforcement for them. Again,
Reich is presenting and
perpetuating a new myth, and not
a (quote-unquote) balanced view.
However, having satisfied
ourselves that Reich is tracing a
mylh, could we perhaps judge it
within that context? Reich's
theses deplore scientific
objectivism that excludes
affections and spontanaeity.
Perhaps the greatest power the
myth has is not its grounding in
observable fact, but is its
existence as a myth, as a vehicle
for belief. Such power that a
myth has is precisely what Reich
finds so important in the new
generation. He says in the second
section, entitled "The New
Consciousness," that
What has happened now is that
the state had begun to do
things that reveal the falsity of
existing illusions and myths.
But Reich's approach to the
New Consciousness is almost as
inconsistent as his analysis of the
Corporate Slate. He tries to
systemitize this change in terms
of three Consciousnesses, almost

as if he could delimit objectively
this change in belief. In fact, he
almost forgets that he is tracing,
not characters or consciousness,
but ideals and myths as they
have developed and are
developing.
Patronizing?
Sometimes it is very hard to
know, also, whether Reich is
patronizing young people, or
whether he actually believes this
myth of the New Consciousness.
Often he is as hyperbolic in his
praise of youth's clothes and
music as he has been in criticizing
the old System and
Consciousness.
His argument becomes quite
original and creative when he
begins to describe what forms the
"revolution" will take:
No political revolution is
possible in the United States
right now, but no such
revolution is needed,
For it is a revolution by
consciousness, and
requires two basic conditions.
First, a process of change of
consciousness must be under
way in the population—a
process that promises to
continue until it reaches a
majority of the people.
Second, the existing order
must depend for its power on
an earlier consciousness, and
therefore be unable to survive a
change of consciousness. Both
of these conditions now exist
in the United States,
This will bring even a new type of
revolution:
. . .the way each individual
actually lives is political in the
most decisive sense of that
word. It is action in one's own
life that counts. When enough
people have decided to live
differently, the political results
will follow naturally and easily,
and the old political forms will
simply be swept away in the
flood.
Reich's thought becomes original
precisely because he releases
himself to his new myth and all its
potentialities. His is a warm vision
of the Apocalypse and whatever
he had lost in scientific
credibility, he makes up for in
sincerity and metaphorical
excitement.
The Greening of America is a
myth; but. as Reich himself says,
its power is its potential for
fruition in the minds of the
American people. Its power
depends on just those media that
popularize what is current. I read
it as scientific proposition and
finished dissatisified; I read it
again as poetry and enjoyed it
very much. 1 recommend that you
read it—but that you read it both
ways.
A new American myth has
been born—and Charles Reich
would be one of the midwives.
This new myth is held out for us
to examine in Reich's book, The
Greening of America. So popular
is the work, that it has been
excerpted in the September 26 th
issue of the "New Yorker," has
sold as fast as it could be supplied
to distributors, and is now already
in its second printing—all in the
space of two month.
Tremendous acceptance—or
rather attention—for a new book
has always made me immediately
suspicious of its worth. Often a
book, merely by having been
advertised in serendipitous ways,
is hailed as a great work before it's
been read by any but a tiny
fraction of the public. It seems
that a vicious circle can begin in
which some attention begets more
attention begets so much more
attention.
One of the features of our
media, including this newspaper,
magazines, television, and radio, is
their unique capability of
commenting precisely on what is
current, is popular, or

much-discussed. We have a filter
that habitually turns the element
"culture" into the compound
"mass-culture." What comes out
may or may not be what we were
searching for initially.
So it is with great reluctance
that I review this excerpt from
Reich's book. I know that my
mere mention of it may have ten
or twenty more people read the
thing, which will in turn create
more attention and, consequently,
acceptance of the work as
"amazing" or "extraordinary."
Timely it is; but whether it is
remarkable as a piece of
fact—which it purports to be—is
another question.
Non-Objectivp
The first section of the
excerpt, entitled "The Corporate
State," begins by presenting
several related, general
conclusions about today's
corporate society. Reich then tries
to demonstrate the truth of those
generalities by examining our
economic and political structures
in more detail. He bases much of
his reasoning on Galbraith's book,
The New Industrial State, and
upon many ideas that are almost
Marcusian.
