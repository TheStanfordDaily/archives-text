# Gilyard Leads Card Romp
## 
### TOM QUINN 
Mike Gilyard provided the
Stanford freshman football team
with one of its most satisfying
seasons as he led the Papooses to a
49-13 trashing over a hopelessly
out-manned Cal team last Friday.
Gilyard hit on 11 of 24 passes
for 228 yards and three
touchdowns before leaving the
game early in the fourth quarter.
Couch Bill Moultrie
complimented Gilyard's
performance by rating him as a
better quarterback at this point
than Washington's starting
quarterback Sonny Sixkiller, who
is second to Jim Plunkett in Pac-8
passing statistics.

Gilyard, who was never
completely well for any of the
four frosh games, was elected
most valuable player by his
teammates Monday.
But Gilyard wasn't the only
star in the massacre.
John Winesberry, chosen
outstanding back for the season
and labelled by Moultrie as
"potentially one of the finest
backs in Stanford history," played
only three quarters and caught
touchdown passes of six and 5 7
yards and rushed for 62 yards in
12 carries.
The Papooses built a 28-7
halftime lead on Gilyard's passing
and Winesberry's receptions.

Rufus Shaw scored on a 38-yard
pass play and Jim Ferguson,
elected team captain, burst
through from the one.
The second half was
anticlimatic.
Eric Test hit Terry Pape with a
one-yard scoring pass and Curt
Brohard intercepted an errant Cal
pass and rolled 8 yards to up
Stanford's point total to 41.
Linebacker Gordon Reigel,
chosen outstanding defensive
player of the season, picked up
Stanford's 49-13.
Stanford's only casualty in the
game was kicker Dave Marcelino
who suffered a broken leg when
he was hit after kicking an extra
point.
Mountrie couldn't help but be
satisfied with the team's
performance. "Overall, the team
finally developed to the stage
where we hoped to be. There's
great potential for the future. The
defense played real well. I would
have been happier if it had been a
shutout, but they played well as a
unit.
"If we're able to add a few
more ballplayers, and with the
freshmen we've just given wings
to, we should be back at the Rose
Bowl next year," he said.
The team finished with a 3-1
record.
In comparison with the other
teams Stanford played, Moultrie
regarded the team's success as due
to better coaching. He credited
head defensive coach Tom Massey
and head offensive coach Ed
Messer and their assistants for a
lot of the results.
Moultrie figures that 12 or 15
of the frosh will be making
contributions on the varsity next
year.

His list includes the eight
player nominated for awards by
their team members as well as
Rufus Shaw, flanker; Reggie
Ishman and Tom Lasater, wide
receivers; John Snider and Jim
Jordon, linebackers; Randy Poltl,
safety; Steve White, offensive
guard; and Keith Rowen,
offensive tackle—to name a few.
Team awards: Captain, James
Ferguson; Most Valuable, Mike
Gilyard; Outstanding Defensive
Back, Max Goldstein; Outstanding
Offensive Back, John Winesberry;
Outstanding Offensive Lineman,
Reuben Monmouth; Outstanding
Defensive Player, Gordon Reigel;
Most Improved Player, Terry
Pape; Most Inspirational, Jim
Preis.

HANDY—Frosh defenders Kevin McCloskey (45) and Randy Poltl (36) cover a Cal receiver in Friday's action at the stadium. The Papooses
walloped the Bear cubs 4 9-13, and snared seven pass interceptions in the process. The Papooses, who lost their opening game to UCLA, finished
up with consecutive wins over Cal Poly, USC and Califirnia to complete the season with a 3-1 mark. Quarterback Mike Gilyard paced the frosh
with 228 yards passing, 11 completions and three scoring passes while playing little more than three quarters.
