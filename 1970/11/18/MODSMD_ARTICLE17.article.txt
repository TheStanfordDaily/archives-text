# Gymnastics Sessions Open For All Women
## 
### 
Women in the community
interested in developing skills in
gymnastics are welcome to attend
Wednesday sessions from 7:30 to
10 p.m. in the women's
gymnasium.
The weekly sessions are
sponsored by the Women's
Recreation Association.
Women's gymnastics includes
four events: free exercise,
vaulting, balance beam and
uneven parallel bars. The sport,
considered to be one of the most
graceful and feminine in athletics,
is gaining in popularity at
Stanford, according to the WRA.
Miss Heidi Klaus is the
women's gymnastics coach.
The most challenging of the
four events is the balance
beam—four inches wide and four

feet off the ground—on which
experts do cartwheels,
handstands, rolls and dance steps.
The uneven parallel bars is
possibly the most spectacular of
the events, as the gymnast travels
between the high and low bar in
constant motion. Or at least the
more expert ones do. Those who
might think it looks easy and then
find their stomachs crashing
persistently into the low bar have
a tendency to change their
opinions quickly.
The WRA will put on a modern
gymnastics clinic December 4,
open to all interested persons.
Later in the year, Stanford will
sponsor two meets. Competitive
gymnastics will start towards the
end of winter quarter and extend
into the spring.
