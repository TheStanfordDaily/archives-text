## Harriers Third Two Runners Advance 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's third place finish in
the Pac-8 Championship meet at
Pullman, Washington last
Saturday ended the cross country
season for all the Indian runners
except Don Kardong and Arvid
Kretz who will run in the NCAA
Championship meet on November
23rd at William and Mary.
Kardong and Kretz were
responsible for all of Stanford's
first place finishes this year and
their seventh and eighth place
finishes in the Pac-8 meet should
give them a good chance to place
among the top 25 runners in the
nation.
Pac-8 Strong
The Pac-8 has traditionally
been one of the strongest cross
country conferences in the nation.
Last year, Oregon and Washington
State ran 1-2 in the Pac-8 and
placed 3rd and 4th in the NCAA
meet. Stanford's only entrant in
the national championship race

last year, Greg Brock, placed fifth
in the Pae-8 race and ninth at the
NCAA meet.
Junior Robert Coe is not going
to Williamsburg for the meet
because of a knee injury that he
incurred two weeks ago. Coe
finished 17 th in the Pae-8 meet,
running on a hilly and slippery
course that gave all the Indian
runners trouble.
Duncan Macdonald turned in a
surprisingly strong performance,
finishing tenth after placing only
ninth the week before in
Stanford's unimpressive victory
over Cal. Macdonald is a 3:59
miler and showed great versatility
in running well over WSLTs rough
six mile course.
Coach Marshall Clark conceded
that Oregon again proved this year
that it was decidedly superior ot
any Pac-8 team. Last year, the
Cards barely pulled out a third
place finish in the Pac-8 meet held
at Stanford. This year, however,
Clark saw his squad finish a strong

third and cast doubt on second
place Washington State's ability to
beat Stanford in the future.
Second Shot
Oregon's top runner, Steve
Prefontaine, is only a sophomore
and will lead an Oregon squad
that should dominate the Pac-8
next year. Kardong and Kretz will
get another chance to run against
Prefontaine in the NCAA meet.
This season, Stanford managed
to separate itself from the pack of
teams below Oregon and
Washington State and Clark's
squad should be able to challenge
for the leadership of the Pac-8
next year.
