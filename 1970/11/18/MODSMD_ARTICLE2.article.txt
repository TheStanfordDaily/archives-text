# Chicano Press
## Journalism Project Growing 
### WALLY THURSTON 
There aren't any flashy posters on
the second floor of MECHA House
(Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de
Aztlan). The staff of the Chicano Press
at Stanford (CPS) is too busy to worry
about political paraphanelia.
They have little to work with (an
old Daily typesetter, a tiny dark room
with dripping faucets, a headsetter
rented from General Electric and two
layout tables) and a lot to do.
The press, only six weeks old, will
start issuing its own releases this week
and already puts out three publications
regularly. Chicanismo, a monthly
publication is aimed at educating the
campus community on Chicano affairs.
La Lucha, a bilingual monthly serving
northern Santa Clara Communities,
covers schools, associations and
provides general information on
opportunities available to
Mexican-Americans.
The Chicano Quarterly, now in its
third edition, contains essays, term
papers, art and research by Stanford
Chicano students and faculty.
In addition to the editions,
journalism student A 1 Lopez, who
initiated the press, has invested in a
library that stocks every Chicano
publication in the United States; along
with journalism books, governmental
reports and research. Although the
library is only a few weeks old, it will
soon outgrow the small closet set apart
for filing back issues.
The Chicano Press success is
largely due to healthy funding. Lopez, a
short haired, dark eyed man is an
energetic and persuasive fund raiser. At
first the space and funding came
directly from Mecha, but the press is
quickly gaining life of its own.
The main source of income comes
from the typesetting it is doing for
other Chicano organizations. "Es

Tiempo," Foothill College's newspaper
is already being set at CPS Lopez is
negotiating with groups at DeAnza,
Canada and Venceremos college for
similar arrangements. The contracts will
be able to finance the Stanford issues
and pay capital costs of the general
operation. Chicano Press can charge
about half the commercial fee for its
work.
The press is also funded by some
staffers who participate in public
speaking and seminar programs and
voluntarily turn in their pay checks.
Others are on work-study programs
directed by the Financial Aids Office in
the Old Union.
According to Lopez, an Air Force
veteran who occasionally has to check
his "disciplinary tendencies," "Profits
involved are solely to support our own
organization, which tries to teach
Chicanos everything about publishing.
The center's purpose is to turn out
quality objective journalism from a
Chicano perspective. The publications
will always be somewhat biased; but all
publications are anyway." Lopez, a
photo-journalism enthusiast himself,
spends a lot of time teaching
photographic techniques to the staffers.
One of the greatest dangers facing
the CPS, insists Lopez, is a takeover by
power hungry individuals with a narrow
political vision. "I see too many
ideological diversifications in the
movement; our main purpose here is to
teach people good journalism, so that
they may become more influential
when they get out. We try to keep
away from bylines, we don't want any
particular individual to gain
prominence and recognition."
To make sure this "takeover"
doesn't occur, the press will soon have
an editorial board where policy and
business decisions are planned to be
made democratically. The board is
necessary because Lopez, who has been

directing the operation so far, will
graduate next quarter. He plans to
apply for a television reporting job
somewhere in California.
Although the Chicano Press at
Stanford still receives moral and
economic support from Mecha, it will
soon be able to stand on its own. Being
that it is not a direct Mecha project,
but a sort of offspring, possibilities of
severance exist. The decision, says
Lopez, would probably have to come
from Mecha, because they made the
initial investment.
Regardless of status, the Chicano
Press has the potential to become one
of the most important informational
and training centers for the movement
in the country. Its rapid growth and
enthusiatic achievements are probably
due mainly to Lopez's philosophy
which invades every corner of the floor,
"I believe in action; when people see
things happening instead of discussed,
they really come alive."
