Nixon Wants Aid
WASHINGTON — President Nixon has summoned
bipartisan congressional leaders to the White House
on Wednesday to tell them the administration wants
an added $1 billion in foreign aid funds for Israel and
several Asian nations.
The lion's share of the proposed new
appropriation, $5 00 million to finance the sale of
military equipment, is destined for Israel, according
to knowledgeable officials.
Cambodia is due to get $25 0 million of military
and economic aid under the pproposed assistance.
Nixon is expected to tell congressional leaders that
the main basis for the request for additional funds is
the Nixon Doctrine of reducing U.S. involvement in
the defense of foreign countries while at the same
time helping them to strengthen their won defense
resources. The supplemental appropriation would be
in addition to a $2.2 billion adminstration request
pending in Congress.
Soviet 'Bathtub 9 Lands
MOSCOW — A Soviet moonrover, looking like an
enclosed bathtub on wheels, rolled about the lunar
surface Tuesday, steered away from craters and rocks
by scientists on earth watching it on television.
The eight-wheeled vehicle rolled down a gangplank
from the unmanned Luna 17 moonship three hours
after making a soft landing on the lunar surface.
In the bathtub-like enclosure, the moonrover
carried scientific apparatus, ccontrol instruments,
television cameras and radio communications
equipment.
Panthers Investigated
WASHINGTON — A congressional investigator
testified Tuesday a $20,000 donation to a program
for hungry children was used to help raise bail for
Black Panther defense minister Huey P. Newton.
Investigator Neil Wetterman told the House

Internal Security Committee the check, through a
New York bank, listed the money as a gift from an
anonymous donor to the Black Panther breakfast
program. It was dated July 23 and was sent to the
Panther national headquarters in Berkeley, California,
he added.
Basing his testimony on banK records obtained
through subpoena, Wetterman said a Black Panther
party official withdrew that amount from the
national headquarters account August 5 in a check
payable to cash, then got a cashier's check that day
made out to the Alameda County Clerk at Oakland,
California. Newton was then released.

WASHINGTON — The Senate Tuesday passed a bill
establishing the first all-embracing job safety program
at the federal level to deal with 1 4,500 deaths and 2.2
million injuries which occur each year in industry.The
vote was 8 2 to 3, with the noes coming from Sens.
James Eastland, D-Miss., Sam Ervin Jr., D-N.C., and
Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.
Alan Cranston, D-California, said the job safety
bill Tuesday would enable California to get a 3.3
million federal grant and double its present
occupational health and safety bidget.
The bill still is subject to house passage and
presidential approval.
Syrian Coup 'Reassuring s
LIBYA — Strong man Col. Muammar Kadafi
concluded an unannounced 2 4-hour visit to Syria on
Tuesday, described the overthrow of the Marxist
regime there as "reassuring" and invited the new
Damascus government to join Egypt, Libya and
Sudan in their proposed federation.
Kadafi said Syria's new leaders assured him they
will establish a national union government to
"maintain Syria as the eastern Arab fortress on
Israel's border."
Diplomats in Beirut reported that Assad started a

purge of the ousted regime's supporters, and a Beirut
newspaper said 7 0 politicians and army officers have
asked for asylum in Lebanon.
Freedom Misunderstood
SAN DIEGO, Calif. — A national task force said
Tuesday that a majority of American young people
lacks "any consistent understanding or conviction
about the exercise of free speech."
The results of year-long surveys of about 90,000
persons up to the age of 35 were made public by the
Education Commission of the States, a non-profit
organization set up in 1964 with funds from the
Carnegie Corporation.
In a random sampling across the nation, those
interviewed were asked if they would permit
Americans to hear these statements by radio or
television: "Russia is better than the United States,"
"Some races of people are better than others," "It is
not necessary to believe in God."
Sixty-eight per cent of adults from 26 to 35 said
they would refuse to permit the broadcast. So would
94 per cent of boys and girls 13 years old and 78 per
cent of youngsters 17 years old.
Reporter Innocent
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal appeals court has
ruled that a newsman cannot be ordered to appear
before a secret U.S. grand jury session unless the
government demonstrates a "compelling public need"
for his presence.
The decision by the three-judge 9 th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals panel held that Earl Caldwell, a
New York Times reporter, was innocent of contempt
for failure to appear last June before a federal grand
jury probing Black Panther activities.
One of his attorneys, Law Prof. Anthony
Amsterdam of Stanford University, said, "I think it
gives the kind of protection newsmen need in these
times and prevents the government from using
newsmen as investigators."
