# Bowl Seats Sure For All Students
## 
### 
Student tickets to the Ruse Bowl go
on sale today at Maples Pavilion from 3
p.m. to midnight with each student
guaranteed a ticket if they buy today.
An advertisement in the Dailies of
the last week by the Athletic
Department indicated that the
maximum number of students tickets
available would be 11,000. However,
University Relations Director Lyle
Nelson told the Daily last night that the
University intends to "provide a ticket
for every registered student who wishes
to attend the game." There are 12,566
registered University students this
quarter.
The figure of 1 1,000 tickets, Nelson
said, is an estimate of the number of
students who will buy tickets today,
"based upon the fact that 10,650
student tickets were issued for the
regular year."
Student seating for the Bowl game
starts on the 5 0 yard line and proceeds
toward the end zones. All student
tickets will be for reserved seats.
"The (Athletic) Department expects
that all students will be served and
ticket sales completed considerably
before the midnight hour," Nelson said.
According to the advertisement on
Bowl game tickets on page 3 of today's
Daily, "Purchasers will be requested to
line up single file at three entrances
(Doors A, B, G) (at Maples Pavillion)."
There will be three or four sellers at
each sales point.
"Earliest arrivals will receive the best
yardline location on the 5 0 yard line,
but there will be no choice of seat

position (High, Middle or Low)."
Unversity ticket manager Ted Glarrow
thinks the student tickets will reach to
near the goal line.
The ticket price will be $4.00 each
and no spouse tickets will be available.
There will be a limit of one ticket sold
to each student and a limit of two cards
allowed per student.
Nelson said the University's
allocation of tickets is "approximately
42,000, of which 3,250 are earmarked
for official athletic department and
conference obligations (players,
coaches, band, game officials, etc.)
leaving 38 ,750 for others."
After selling student tickets, Nelson
expects 2 7,70 0 to be left. Of this
number, according to Nelson, "19,000
were allocated for regular season ticket
purchasers to Stanford's home games
(including approximately 2,300 faculty
and staff) and to members of the Buck
Club which supports the athletic
program; 4,900 for all official
University purposes (alumni leaders,
fund raising volunteers, etc.) ..."
This leaves "approximately 3,850 to
a general draw for alumni, faculty and
staff and others not eligible to receive
tickets" in the other categories. The
exact number will depend on how
many other tickets are sold.
Nelson did say that "plans are to
check student body cards at the gate in
Pasadena" but "wives or husbands will
need only to show some identification
establishing their relationship with the
student body card holder."

each sales point.
"Earliest arrivals will receive the best
yardline location on the 5 0 yard line,
but there will be no choice of seat

position (High, Middle or Low)."
Unversity ticket manager Ted Glarrow
thinks the student tickets will reach to
near the goal line.
The ticket price will be $4.00 each
and no spouse tickets will be available.
There will be a limit of one ticket sold
to each student and a limit of two cards
allowed per student.
Nelson said the University's
allocation of tickets is "approximately
42,000, of which 3,250 are earmarked
for official athletic department and
conference obligations (players,
coaches, band, game officials, etc.)
leaving 38 ,750 for others."
After selling student tickets, Nelson
expects 2 7,70 0 to be left. Of this
number, according to Nelson, "19,000
were allocated for regular season ticket
purchasers to Stanford's home games
(including approximately 2,300 faculty
and staff) and to members of the Buck
Club which supports the athletic
program; 4,900 for all official
University purposes (alumni leaders,
fund raising volunteers, etc.) ..."
This leaves "approximately 3,850 to
a general draw for alumni, faculty and
staff and others not eligible to receive
tickets" in the other categories. The
exact number will depend on how
many other tickets are sold.
Nelson did say that "plans are to
check student body cards at the gate in
Pasadena" but "wives or husbands will
need only to show some identification
establishing their relationship with the
student body card holder."
Student tickets to the Ruse Bowl go
on sale today at Maples Pavilion from 3
p.m. to midnight with each student
guaranteed a ticket if they buy today.
An advertisement in the Dailies of
the last week by the Athletic
Department indicated that the
maximum number of students tickets
available would be 11,000. However,
University Relations Director Lyle
Nelson told the Daily last night that the
University intends to "provide a ticket
for every registered student who wishes
to attend the game." There are 12,566
registered University students this
quarter.
The figure of 1 1,000 tickets, Nelson
said, is an estimate of the number of
students who will buy tickets today,
"based upon the fact that 10,650
student tickets were issued for the
regular year."
Student seating for the Bowl game
starts on the 5 0 yard line and proceeds
toward the end zones. All student
tickets will be for reserved seats.
"The (Athletic) Department expects
that all students will be served and
ticket sales completed considerably
before the midnight hour," Nelson said.
According to the advertisement on
Bowl game tickets on page 3 of today's
Daily, "Purchasers will be requested to
line up single file at three entrances
(Doors A, B, G) (at Maples Pavillion)."
There will be three or four sellers at
each sales point.
