# Arjay Miller â€” Organization Man Heads Biz School
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
Arjay Miller, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, is a classical
example of a man who puts his faith in
organizations. He's been a "Whiz Kid"
for Ford Motor Company, an
economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, and a
serviceman in the Air Force.
In 1968, Business School Professor
G.L. Bach persuaded Miller to leave his
job as vice-chairman of Ford Motor
Company and fill the deanship vacated
by Ernest Arbuckle. Many observers
felt that Miller was ripe for the job
offer since he was upset with Henry
Ford ll's decision to kick him upstairs
from his previous post as president.
Miller remained at Ford for one
more year in order "to become more
familiar with my new job," he says,
"and to institutionalize such programs
at Ford as minority hiring and
promotion and minority dealership
programs."
Miller feels that the world of
academia is not much different from
his world at Ford. "The mixture of
problems that I now face as dean," he
says, "will be common to the business
man of the future. That is, we are
moving away from a hierarchial
discipline structure towards one of
consensus."
Miller's Personality
Dean Miller's associates, however,
feel that the Dean is just beginning to
make his personality felt on the school.
Associate Dean Gary Williams says,
"These first 18 months have been ones
of adaptation for him. He is busy

getting used to the academic
environment, but he's learning fast.
He's receptive and he'll listen to almost
any idea."
Roger Salquist, president of the GSB
students, agrees. "Dean Miller has an
open door policy this year," he says.
"Anyone can go in and gripe to him.
He lunches with the second year
students and next quarter we'll expand
these luncheons to include the first
year students.

"Dean Miller has also expanded the
faculty. He shows great deference to
their advice. In fact, one of the things
which he says all the time is 'the real
power at this school is the faculty."
With new faculty have come new
courses, and among the more
iconoclastic which Dean Miller has
supported are the "Economics of
Poverty" and "Decision Making in the
Public Sector." He believes that the
crises in America, particularly the

urban problem, can be solved by more
social responsibility in private business,
a greater commitment of individuals to
public interest, and above all more
resourceful action and regulation by
government agencies. He is doing
everything he can to encourage such
ends.
Miller is almost a perfect example of
what Yale Law professor Charles Reich
calls "Consciousness II." He may
criticize specific aspects of society, but

his struggles for reform are within the
general current of American
organizational thought. When pushing
for change he is cautious about the
stand he takes in public.
Dean Miller believes strongly that
the business school "is not training
people to make money. The objective
of our school is to teach people
management. Managers are people who
know how to meet the needs of
society.

"When I got out of school the need
was for private goods. Industry filled
that need, and now the needs are
cleaner air and water, more housing,
safer products and so on. The kinds of
students who graduate from here will
have management skill with which they
can answer those needs."
Despite this dedication to
management, Miller will not consider
changing the name of the Business
School to the School of Management,
as other universities have done and as
some individuals suggest. "Names are
not important to me," he says. "What
is important is what we teach not what
we call ourselves."
And what the Business School
teaches is respect for the free enterprise
system. "I believe in pluralism, free
enterprise, the profit system," says
Miller. "Private businessmen make a
very significant contribution to our
society ... Take the executives of
Ford, for example. They make a
contribution by putting out a product
that meets the basic human need to
move. People all over the world have
been mobile. They like to go from
point A to point B when they feel like
it. The private automobile provides
that."
When asked how he felt about
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Dean
Miller, replied that "I wish there were a
hundred more of him . .. but standards
of safety should be stated in terms of
performance, not in terms of outlawing
or prescribing specific devices. In the
case of automobiles, for example, laws
should not prohibit internal


'/ believe in pluralism, free enterprise, the projit system'
combustion engines or require the use
of steam engines, but should establish
limits on pollutants. The government
should permit private manufacturers to
exercise their own ingenuity in meeting
performance standards."
Miller's whiz kid activities got
started in the Air Force. With a group
of statistical analysts, including Robert
S. McNamara, Edward Lundy and led
by Charles "Tex" Thorton, these
soldiers made plans to offer themselves
as a package deal to major American
corporations as soon as the war was
over.
Thorton prepared an employment
prospectus and sent it to more than
100 firms. Only Allegany Corporation
responded with an appointment for an
interview. Thorton displeased with his
sole prospect, responded to rumor that

Henry Ford II was looking for new men
to spark his company. He wired Ford,
who, impressed with the young man's
brash but direct manner, told him to
apply.
In 19 46 ten Air Force veterans
walked into Ford's main office in
Dearborn, Michigan. They became
known as the "Whiz Kids." Two still
remain on the staff: J. Edward Lundy
as executive vice president and Ben
Mills as purchasing vice president.
Three left soon after they were hired,
while Tex Thorton stayed two years
before leaving to join Howard Hughes
and later to found Litton Industries.
Two eventually became presidents of
Ford. McNamara followed Henry II in
1960 and Arjay Miller in turn
succeeded McNamara when he left the
presidency after only a month to join
President Kennedy as Secretary of
Defense.

of adaptation for him. He is busy

getting used to the academic
environment, but he's learning fast.
He's receptive and he'll listen to almost
any idea."
Roger Salquist, president of the GSB
students, agrees. "Dean Miller has an
open door policy this year," he says.
"Anyone can go in and gripe to him.
He lunches with the second year
students and next quarter we'll expand
these luncheons to include the first
year students.

"Dean Miller has also expanded the
faculty. He shows great deference to
their advice. In fact, one of the things
which he says all the time is 'the real
power at this school is the faculty."
With new faculty have come new
courses, and among the more
iconoclastic which Dean Miller has
supported are the "Economics of
Poverty" and "Decision Making in the
Public Sector." He believes that the
crises in America, particularly the

urban problem, can be solved by more
social responsibility in private business,
a greater commitment of individuals to
public interest, and above all more
resourceful action and regulation by
government agencies. He is doing
everything he can to encourage such
ends.
Miller is almost a perfect example of
what Yale Law professor Charles Reich
calls "Consciousness II." He may
criticize specific aspects of society, but

his struggles for reform are within the
general current of American
organizational thought. When pushing
for change he is cautious about the
stand he takes in public.
Dean Miller believes strongly that
the business school "is not training
people to make money. The objective
of our school is to teach people
management. Managers are people who
know how to meet the needs of
society.

"When I got out of school the need
was for private goods. Industry filled
that need, and now the needs are
cleaner air and water, more housing,
safer products and so on. The kinds of
students who graduate from here will
have management skill with which they
can answer those needs."
Despite this dedication to
management, Miller will not consider
changing the name of the Business
School to the School of Management,
as other universities have done and as
some individuals suggest. "Names are
not important to me," he says. "What
is important is what we teach not what
we call ourselves."
And what the Business School
teaches is respect for the free enterprise
system. "I believe in pluralism, free
enterprise, the profit system," says
Miller. "Private businessmen make a
very significant contribution to our
society ... Take the executives of
Ford, for example. They make a
contribution by putting out a product
that meets the basic human need to
move. People all over the world have
been mobile. They like to go from
point A to point B when they feel like
it. The private automobile provides
that."
When asked how he felt about
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Dean
Miller, replied that "I wish there were a
hundred more of him . .. but standards
of safety should be stated in terms of
performance, not in terms of outlawing
or prescribing specific devices. In the
case of automobiles, for example, laws
should not prohibit internal


'/ believe in pluralism, free enterprise, the projit system'
combustion engines or require the use
of steam engines, but should establish
limits on pollutants. The government
should permit private manufacturers to
exercise their own ingenuity in meeting
performance standards."
Miller's whiz kid activities got
started in the Air Force. With a group
of statistical analysts, including Robert
S. McNamara, Edward Lundy and led
by Charles "Tex" Thorton, these
soldiers made plans to offer themselves
as a package deal to major American
corporations as soon as the war was
over.
Thorton prepared an employment
prospectus and sent it to more than
100 firms. Only Allegany Corporation
responded with an appointment for an
interview. Thorton displeased with his
sole prospect, responded to rumor that

Henry Ford II was looking for new men
to spark his company. He wired Ford,
who, impressed with the young man's
brash but direct manner, told him to
apply.
In 19 46 ten Air Force veterans
walked into Ford's main office in
Dearborn, Michigan. They became
known as the "Whiz Kids." Two still
remain on the staff: J. Edward Lundy
as executive vice president and Ben
Mills as purchasing vice president.
Three left soon after they were hired,
while Tex Thorton stayed two years
before leaving to join Howard Hughes
and later to found Litton Industries.
Two eventually became presidents of
Ford. McNamara followed Henry II in
1960 and Arjay Miller in turn
succeeded McNamara when he left the
presidency after only a month to join
President Kennedy as Secretary of
Defense.
Arjay Miller, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, is a classical
example of a man who puts his faith in
organizations. He's been a "Whiz Kid"
for Ford Motor Company, an
economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, and a
serviceman in the Air Force.
In 1968, Business School Professor
G.L. Bach persuaded Miller to leave his
job as vice-chairman of Ford Motor
Company and fill the deanship vacated
by Ernest Arbuckle. Many observers
felt that Miller was ripe for the job
offer since he was upset with Henry
Ford ll's decision to kick him upstairs
from his previous post as president.
Miller remained at Ford for one
more year in order "to become more
familiar with my new job," he says,
"and to institutionalize such programs
at Ford as minority hiring and
promotion and minority dealership
programs."
Miller feels that the world of
academia is not much different from
his world at Ford. "The mixture of
problems that I now face as dean," he
says, "will be common to the business
man of the future. That is, we are
moving away from a hierarchial
discipline structure towards one of
consensus."

stand he takes in public.
Dean Miller believes strongly that
the business school "is not training
people to make money. The objective
of our school is to teach people
management. Managers are people who
know how to meet the needs of
society.

"When I got out of school the need
was for private goods. Industry filled
that need, and now the needs are
cleaner air and water, more housing,
safer products and so on. The kinds of
students who graduate from here will
have management skill with which they
can answer those needs."
Despite this dedication to
management, Miller will not consider
changing the name of the Business
School to the School of Management,
as other universities have done and as
some individuals suggest. "Names are
not important to me," he says. "What
is important is what we teach not what
we call ourselves."
And what the Business School
teaches is respect for the free enterprise
system. "I believe in pluralism, free
enterprise, the profit system," says
Miller. "Private businessmen make a
very significant contribution to our
society ... Take the executives of
Ford, for example. They make a
contribution by putting out a product
that meets the basic human need to
move. People all over the world have
been mobile. They like to go from
point A to point B when they feel like
it. The private automobile provides
that."
When asked how he felt about
consumer advocate Ralph Nader, Dean
Miller, replied that "I wish there were a
hundred more of him . .. but standards
of safety should be stated in terms of
performance, not in terms of outlawing
or prescribing specific devices. In the
case of automobiles, for example, laws
should not prohibit internal


'/ believe in pluralism, free enterprise, the projit system'
combustion engines or require the use
of steam engines, but should establish
limits on pollutants. The government
should permit private manufacturers to
exercise their own ingenuity in meeting
performance standards."
Miller's whiz kid activities got
started in the Air Force. With a group
of statistical analysts, including Robert
S. McNamara, Edward Lundy and led
by Charles "Tex" Thorton, these
soldiers made plans to offer themselves
as a package deal to major American
corporations as soon as the war was
over.
Thorton prepared an employment
prospectus and sent it to more than
100 firms. Only Allegany Corporation
responded with an appointment for an
interview. Thorton displeased with his
sole prospect, responded to rumor that

Henry Ford II was looking for new men
to spark his company. He wired Ford,
who, impressed with the young man's
brash but direct manner, told him to
apply.
In 19 46 ten Air Force veterans
walked into Ford's main office in
Dearborn, Michigan. They became
known as the "Whiz Kids." Two still
remain on the staff: J. Edward Lundy
as executive vice president and Ben
Mills as purchasing vice president.
Three left soon after they were hired,
while Tex Thorton stayed two years
before leaving to join Howard Hughes
and later to found Litton Industries.
Two eventually became presidents of
Ford. McNamara followed Henry II in
1960 and Arjay Miller in turn
succeeded McNamara when he left the
presidency after only a month to join
President Kennedy as Secretary of
Defense.
Arjay Miller, Dean of the Graduate
School of Business, is a classical
example of a man who puts his faith in
organizations. He's been a "Whiz Kid"
for Ford Motor Company, an
economist for the Federal Reserve
Bank of San Francisco, and a
serviceman in the Air Force.
In 1968, Business School Professor
G.L. Bach persuaded Miller to leave his
job as vice-chairman of Ford Motor
Company and fill the deanship vacated
by Ernest Arbuckle. Many observers
felt that Miller was ripe for the job
offer since he was upset with Henry
Ford ll's decision to kick him upstairs
from his previous post as president.
Miller remained at Ford for one
more year in order "to become more
familiar with my new job," he says,
"and to institutionalize such programs
at Ford as minority hiring and
promotion and minority dealership
programs."
Miller feels that the world of
academia is not much different from
his world at Ford. "The mixture of
problems that I now face as dean," he
says, "will be common to the business
man of the future. That is, we are
moving away from a hierarchial
discipline structure towards one of
consensus."
Miller's Personality
Dean Miller's associates, however,
feel that the Dean is just beginning to
make his personality felt on the school.
Associate Dean Gary Williams says,
"These first 18 months have been ones
of adaptation for him. He is busy

getting used to the academic
environment, but he's learning fast.
He's receptive and he'll listen to almost
any idea."
Roger Salquist, president of the GSB
students, agrees. "Dean Miller has an
open door policy this year," he says.
"Anyone can go in and gripe to him.
He lunches with the second year
students and next quarter we'll expand
these luncheons to include the first
year students.

"Dean Miller has also expanded the
faculty. He shows great deference to
their advice. In fact, one of the things
which he says all the time is 'the real
power at this school is the faculty."
With new faculty have come new
courses, and among the more
iconoclastic which Dean Miller has
supported are the "Economics of
Poverty" and "Decision Making in the
Public Sector." He believes that the
crises in America, particularly the

urban problem, can be solved by more
social responsibility in private business,
a greater commitment of individuals to
public interest, and above all more
resourceful action and regulation by
government agencies. He is doing
everything he can to encourage such
ends.
Miller is almost a perfect example of
what Yale Law professor Charles Reich
calls "Consciousness II." He may
criticize specific aspects of society, but

his struggles for reform are within the
general current of American
organizational thought. When pushing
for change he is cautious about the
stand he takes in public.
Dean Miller believes strongly that
the business school "is not training
people to make money. The objective
of our school is to teach people
management. Managers are people who
