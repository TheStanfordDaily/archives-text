## Business As Usual At SRI 
### 
SRI continues to grow. This year's
revenue from contract research will be $63
million, more than ever before. Work for
the Department of Defense is down
slightly, only because all DOD spending has
been cut back. Classified contracts and
total government work have proliferated in
the past two years.
The institute continues to take no moral
stand on the type of research for which
they are responsible. "We research business,
not morality," they say. If innocent people
in Asia and the Middle East die because the
work we do is applied to new bombing or
co unterin surge ncy programs, it is our
clients' responsibility, not ours.
In fact, the only change at SRI since the
demonstrations of two years ago has been
legal separation from the University.
Trustees with big business interests have
been replaced on the SRI board of
directors by other corporation presidents
and board chairmen. The end result has
been a more efficient and productive
organization whose work now reaches more
people and productive organization than
ever in its history.
Strengthening of SRI was the last thing
that protesters wanted when they took to

the streets in front of the institute. But the
demonstrations were a precipitating factor
in the split from the University, and today,
the independent institution is under
considerably less pressure to meet any
demands from student critics.
The public relations image is as
impressive as ever. Color slide shows
impress reporters with pictures of SRI
developing Disneyland and producing
miracle grains to feed the starving masses of
the world, but no mention is made of
electronic warfare devices or military
hardware research. Interviews are
tape-recorded, and the public relations
officer is close at hand with piles of SRI
pamphlets and press releases.
The low profile of DOD research, and
the thinning relationship between the
institute and the University have quieted
complaints about SRI. But the fact remains
that the thrust of its work has not been
redirected towards more socially useful
projects.
SRI remains a major eyesore in a
community pocked with military
production. And with the loss of University
influence, any change in SRl's position
seems more remote than ever.
