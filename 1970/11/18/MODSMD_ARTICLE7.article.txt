Is there anything new in Paris?
Yes, there are some new aspects
to the negotiating situation, but
they certainly should not be
overemphasized.
NLF representative, Madame
Nguyen Thi Binh's statement on
September 17 , 1970, contained at
least three new elements. First
there was an offer to "refrain
from attacking the withdrawing
troops of the United States," if
the U.S. in turn would set a date
when all her troops would be out
of Vietnam. This represented an
obvious opening for a negotiated
cease-fire, but only vis-a-vis
American and associated foreign
(Korean, Thai, etc.) troops.
Presumably a cease-fire with the
Saigon forces would be considered
an internal Vietnamese question,
and hence negotiated separately.
Secondly, Madame Binh
expressed a willingness to
negotiate all important political
questions with the Saigon
administration excluding
President Thieu, Vice President
Ky, and Prime Minister Khiem.
While obviously this represented
no softening in NLF hostility
towards the three top Saigon
leaders, it did indicate that the
NLF was willing to sit down with
cabinet-'evel people or army
officers.
Finally, Madame- Binh stated
that the release of all captured
military men could be the subject
of serious discussions at Paris,
providing again that a date was set
for total U.S. withdrawal.
About three weeks later, on
October 7, 1 970, President Nixon
made a brief speech on Indochina
that also contained at least three
new elements. Most important
was his stated willingness to
withdraw all U.S. forces as part of
a general settlement. Prior to this,
the implication was that the U.S.
might hold out for some bases in
South Vietnam, or that 5 0,000 or
more troops might have to remain
indefinitely to "guarantee"
negotiated arrangements.
Cease-Fire
Secondly, Mr. Nixon advocated
a "cease-fire in place," supervised
by international observers and
encompassing Laos and Cambodia
as well as Vietnam. Not only
standard ground operations would
be affected, but also such things
as aerial bombardment and acts of
terror.
Finally, there is something this

time that Mr. Nixon did not say:
he made no mention of elections
as an essential step in achieving a
new array of political forces in
South Vietnam. This may
represent belated recognition of
the fact that elections can never
"decide" a political disagreement
of the magnitude that exists in
Vietnam.
What does it all mean? From
the very beginning the NLF and
North Vietnam have been fighting
and negotiating for two things:
complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops from South Vietnam; and a
significant share for the NLF in
governing at the national level.
No Date
President Nixon now appears
to accept the first point in
principle, albeit without any date
having been mentioned and only
as part of a more general
settlement package. But
unfortunately he has said nothing
new regarding the second
consideration. Indeed the
probable intent of Nixon's
cease-fire proposal is to force an
indefinite partition on the South
Vietnamese people, with the
Thieu regime claiming the urban
areas and most of the productive
lowlands and the NLF getting the
jungles and a few outlying rice
paddies.
Besides grossly ignoring the
desire of almost all Vietnamese
for national unification, such a
cease-fire proposal has its origins
in concepts of warfare that are
now outmoded—military ideas
dating to a time when there were
such things as a battlefront,
protected communications, quiet
rear areas, and populations
committed firmly to one side or
the other. How does one
"partition" a village, for example,
that provides regular aid to the
NLF and accepts the existence of
a Saigon army post in its midst?
How does one allocate a canal or
stream that serves as a supply
route for both sides? Most
importantly, how does one
position a family that has
members fighting on both sides,
that pays taxes to both, and that
has a political outlook reflecting
these ambiguities?
In short, President Nixon's
cease-fire takes little or no
account of political warfare as a
revolutionary innovation in
Vietnam.
Grim Prospects
What happens next? The
prospects remain grim. The North

Vietnamese and the NLF realize
they are engaged in a protracted
struggle with a great power, a
power that is having a hard time
lowering its sights in Indochina.
They are physically and
psychologically prepared to
continue struggling at the present
level almost indefinitely.

President Nixon has shown
that he is capable of defusing the
war issue in terms of traditional
domestic electoral politics, at least
until 1972.
In short, barring some major
new diplomatic initiatives, each
side will continue grimly to
prepare for the time—perhaps a

year or two from
"Vietnamization" is put to its
ultimate political and military
test. Whoever finally proves to
have done his grisly equations
correctly, the tragedy will remain
that hundreds of thousands of
additional lives must thus be
smashed in the bargain.

of Vietnam. This represented an
obvious opening for a negotiated
cease-fire, but only vis-a-vis
American and associated foreign
(Korean, Thai, etc.) troops.
Presumably a cease-fire with the
Saigon forces would be considered
an internal Vietnamese question,
and hence negotiated separately.
Secondly, Madame Binh
expressed a willingness to
negotiate all important political
questions with the Saigon
administration excluding
President Thieu, Vice President
Ky, and Prime Minister Khiem.
While obviously this represented
no softening in NLF hostility
towards the three top Saigon
leaders, it did indicate that the
NLF was willing to sit down with
cabinet-'evel people or army
officers.
Finally, Madame- Binh stated
that the release of all captured
military men could be the subject
of serious discussions at Paris,
providing again that a date was set
for total U.S. withdrawal.
About three weeks later, on
October 7, 1 970, President Nixon
made a brief speech on Indochina
that also contained at least three
new elements. Most important
was his stated willingness to
withdraw all U.S. forces as part of
a general settlement. Prior to this,
the implication was that the U.S.
might hold out for some bases in
South Vietnam, or that 5 0,000 or
more troops might have to remain
indefinitely to "guarantee"
negotiated arrangements.
Cease-Fire
Secondly, Mr. Nixon advocated
a "cease-fire in place," supervised
by international observers and
encompassing Laos and Cambodia
as well as Vietnam. Not only
standard ground operations would
be affected, but also such things
as aerial bombardment and acts of
terror.
Finally, there is something this

time that Mr. Nixon did not say:
he made no mention of elections
as an essential step in achieving a
new array of political forces in
South Vietnam. This may
represent belated recognition of
the fact that elections can never
"decide" a political disagreement
of the magnitude that exists in
Vietnam.
What does it all mean? From
the very beginning the NLF and
North Vietnam have been fighting
and negotiating for two things:
complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops from South Vietnam; and a
significant share for the NLF in
governing at the national level.
No Date
President Nixon now appears
to accept the first point in
principle, albeit without any date
having been mentioned and only
as part of a more general
settlement package. But
unfortunately he has said nothing
new regarding the second
consideration. Indeed the
probable intent of Nixon's
cease-fire proposal is to force an
indefinite partition on the South
Vietnamese people, with the
Thieu regime claiming the urban
areas and most of the productive
lowlands and the NLF getting the
jungles and a few outlying rice
paddies.
Besides grossly ignoring the
desire of almost all Vietnamese
for national unification, such a
cease-fire proposal has its origins
in concepts of warfare that are
now outmoded—military ideas
dating to a time when there were
such things as a battlefront,
protected communications, quiet
rear areas, and populations
committed firmly to one side or
the other. How does one
"partition" a village, for example,
that provides regular aid to the
NLF and accepts the existence of
a Saigon army post in its midst?
How does one allocate a canal or
stream that serves as a supply
route for both sides? Most
importantly, how does one
position a family that has
members fighting on both sides,
that pays taxes to both, and that
has a political outlook reflecting
these ambiguities?
In short, President Nixon's
cease-fire takes little or no
account of political warfare as a
revolutionary innovation in
Vietnam.
Grim Prospects
What happens next? The
prospects remain grim. The North

Vietnamese and the NLF realize
they are engaged in a protracted
struggle with a great power, a
power that is having a hard time
lowering its sights in Indochina.
They are physically and
psychologically prepared to
continue struggling at the present
level almost indefinitely.

President Nixon has shown
that he is capable of defusing the
war issue in terms of traditional
domestic electoral politics, at least
until 1972.
In short, barring some major
new diplomatic initiatives, each
side will continue grimly to
prepare for the time—perhaps a

year or two from
"Vietnamization" is put to its
ultimate political and military
test. Whoever finally proves to
have done his grisly equations
correctly, the tragedy will remain
that hundreds of thousands of
additional lives must thus be
smashed in the bargain.

NLF was willing to sit down with
cabinet-'evel people or army
officers.
Finally, Madame- Binh stated
that the release of all captured
military men could be the subject
of serious discussions at Paris,
providing again that a date was set
for total U.S. withdrawal.
About three weeks later, on
October 7, 1 970, President Nixon
made a brief speech on Indochina
that also contained at least three
new elements. Most important
was his stated willingness to
withdraw all U.S. forces as part of
a general settlement. Prior to this,
the implication was that the U.S.
might hold out for some bases in
South Vietnam, or that 5 0,000 or
more troops might have to remain
indefinitely to "guarantee"
negotiated arrangements.
Cease-Fire
Secondly, Mr. Nixon advocated
a "cease-fire in place," supervised
by international observers and
encompassing Laos and Cambodia
as well as Vietnam. Not only
standard ground operations would
be affected, but also such things
as aerial bombardment and acts of
terror.
Finally, there is something this

time that Mr. Nixon did not say:
he made no mention of elections
as an essential step in achieving a
new array of political forces in
South Vietnam. This may
represent belated recognition of
the fact that elections can never
"decide" a political disagreement
of the magnitude that exists in
Vietnam.
What does it all mean? From
the very beginning the NLF and
North Vietnam have been fighting
and negotiating for two things:
complete withdrawal of U.S.
troops from South Vietnam; and a
significant share for the NLF in
governing at the national level.
No Date
President Nixon now appears
to accept the first point in
principle, albeit without any date
having been mentioned and only
as part of a more general
settlement package. But
unfortunately he has said nothing
new regarding the second
consideration. Indeed the
probable intent of Nixon's
cease-fire proposal is to force an
indefinite partition on the South
Vietnamese people, with the
Thieu regime claiming the urban
areas and most of the productive
lowlands and the NLF getting the
jungles and a few outlying rice
paddies.
Besides grossly ignoring the
desire of almost all Vietnamese
for national unification, such a
cease-fire proposal has its origins
in concepts of warfare that are
now outmoded—military ideas
dating to a time when there were
such things as a battlefront,
protected communications, quiet
rear areas, and populations
committed firmly to one side or
the other. How does one
"partition" a village, for example,
that provides regular aid to the
NLF and accepts the existence of
a Saigon army post in its midst?
How does one allocate a canal or
stream that serves as a supply
route for both sides? Most
importantly, how does one
position a family that has
members fighting on both sides,
that pays taxes to both, and that
has a political outlook reflecting
these ambiguities?
In short, President Nixon's
cease-fire takes little or no
account of political warfare as a
revolutionary innovation in
Vietnam.
Grim Prospects
What happens next? The
prospects remain grim. The North

Vietnamese and the NLF realize
they are engaged in a protracted
struggle with a great power, a
power that is having a hard time
lowering its sights in Indochina.
They are physically and
psychologically prepared to
continue struggling at the present
level almost indefinitely.

President Nixon has shown
that he is capable of defusing the
war issue in terms of traditional
domestic electoral politics, at least
until 1972.
In short, barring some major
new diplomatic initiatives, each
side will continue grimly to
prepare for the time—perhaps a

year or two from
"Vietnamization" is put to its
ultimate political and military
test. Whoever finally proves to
have done his grisly equations
correctly, the tragedy will remain
that hundreds of thousands of
additional lives must thus be
smashed in the bargain.

Is there anything new in Paris?
Yes, there are some new aspects
to the negotiating situation, but
they certainly should not be
overemphasized.
NLF representative, Madame
Nguyen Thi Binh's statement on
September 17 , 1970, contained at
least three new elements. First
there was an offer to "refrain
from attacking the withdrawing
troops of the United States," if
the U.S. in turn would set a date
when all her troops would be out
of Vietnam. This represented an
obvious opening for a negotiated
cease-fire, but only vis-a-vis
American and associated foreign
(Korean, Thai, etc.) troops.
Presumably a cease-fire with the
Saigon forces would be considered
an internal Vietnamese question,
and hence negotiated separately.
Secondly, Madame Binh
expressed a willingness to
negotiate all important political
questions with the Saigon
administration excluding
President Thieu, Vice President
Ky, and Prime Minister Khiem.
While obviously this represented
no softening in NLF hostility
towards the three top Saigon
leaders, it did indicate that the
NLF was willing to sit down with
cabinet-'evel people or army
officers.

military men could be the subject
