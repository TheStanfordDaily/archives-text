## Election Delays Detailed 
### 
bob grant

A number of news stories and
replies have been printed
concerning the delay in the Senate
elections. During the last two
weeks I have attempted to
ascertain the accuracy of various
accusations and the reasons for
the delay. There are a number of
distinguishable issues and each
should be dealt with individually.
Two mistakes by the Elections
Commissioner resulted in a delay
of several weeks in the election of
the Senate. The first mistake was
a failure to properly proof the
first ballot. One name was
misspelled badly, one left off the
ballot, two names in the same
division were given the number
14, and, although alphabetization
is not required, several names
were not in alphabetical order
while the remainder were in order.
When the errors were
discovered, the ballots were
withdrawn for correction and the
election postponed. No errors on
the corrected ballot have as yet
been brought to my attention.
Insufficient Postage
The 9econd mistake was a
failure to use sufficient postage to
mail the second set of overseas
ballots. Some, though not all,
were returned. A new mailing was
made and will probably require

two weeks or more to return.
Until the results are received from
the overseas campuses, the ballots
cannot be counted and have been
stored in the safe.
One accusation that has been
made is that illegal electioneering
occurred near the polls contrary
to the By-Laws of the Association
and that the Elections appearing in
the national figuress
Commissioner failed to prevent it.
Such irregularities are the fault of
those candidates who perpetrated
them. If anyone has evidence of
violations of election rules, he
should present the information to
the Student Judicial Council
which has responsibility for
disciplinary action.
Student Dishonesty
Another criticism made of the
Elections Commissioner related to
voting by students outside of their
constituency. I simply cannot see
how the dishonesty of some
students can be blamed on the
Commissioner. The only means to
prevent such acts is to check each
person's name against a computer
print-out of students by
department. The cost of such a
procedure is the additional time
required for voting, which in turn
reduces the total of votes cast.
The computer sign-out method
was resorted to out of necessity
only when it became clear that
students could not be trusted to
give an honest answer to the
question of which division they
were in.
Other allegations have been
made which go far beyond the
legitimate criticisms and
attempted to argue that the
irregularities were intentional
attempts to benefit candidates
supported by the Black Students
Union. The charge was based on
the fact that a full page ad for

these candidates was not run
during the first election when its
impact would have been wasted
and the delayed election offered a
second chance.The ad, originally
scheduled for Thursday, was
withdrawn by the Daily staff
when they were told the election
was postponed until the following
week. The author of the charge
has issued a statement
withdrawing the accusation. It is
unfortunate that the Daily would
give such wide publicity to such
an unnecessary slur on the
integrity of a campus organization
after it had been disavowed by its
author.
From my personal dealings
with the Elections Commissioner I
know that he went out of his way
to avoid any contacts with the
BSU and to eliminate the
possibility of any implication of
special advantage for that group. I
believe no one who has worked
with him has any doubt as to him
impartiality on this point.
Complex Job
One final issue related to the
selection of the Election
Commissioner. For a variety of
reasons, most of them
ill-considered, the Student Senate
last spring discourteously and
ungraciously dismissed Jan
Westfall as Commissioner after she
had faultlessly supervised a
difficult and heated election. The
problems this fall indicate how
complex the job of Elections
Commissioner really is and in turn
reflect very favorably on Jan's
performance last spring. There are
some By-Law revisions which will
aid in future elections and I hope
that when the Senate considers
them this fall, they will also offer
Jan the thanks that she deserves.

during the first election when its
impact would have been wasted
and the delayed election offered a
second chance.The ad, originally
scheduled for Thursday, was
withdrawn by the Daily staff
when they were told the election
was postponed until the following
week. The author of the charge
has issued a statement
withdrawing the accusation. It is
unfortunate that the Daily would
give such wide publicity to such
an unnecessary slur on the
integrity of a campus organization
after it had been disavowed by its
author.
From my personal dealings
with the Elections Commissioner I
know that he went out of his way
to avoid any contacts with the
BSU and to eliminate the
possibility of any implication of
special advantage for that group. I
believe no one who has worked
with him has any doubt as to him
impartiality on this point.
Complex Job
One final issue related to the
selection of the Election
Commissioner. For a variety of
reasons, most of them
ill-considered, the Student Senate
last spring discourteously and
ungraciously dismissed Jan
Westfall as Commissioner after she
had faultlessly supervised a
difficult and heated election. The
problems this fall indicate how
complex the job of Elections
Commissioner really is and in turn
reflect very favorably on Jan's
performance last spring. There are
some By-Law revisions which will
aid in future elections and I hope
that when the Senate considers
them this fall, they will also offer
Jan the thanks that she deserves.

A number of news stories and
replies have been printed
concerning the delay in the Senate
elections. During the last two
weeks I have attempted to
ascertain the accuracy of various
accusations and the reasons for
the delay. There are a number of
distinguishable issues and each
should be dealt with individually.
Two mistakes by the Elections
Commissioner resulted in a delay
of several weeks in the election of
the Senate. The first mistake was
a failure to properly proof the
first ballot. One name was
misspelled badly, one left off the
ballot, two names in the same
division were given the number
14, and, although alphabetization
is not required, several names
were not in alphabetical order
while the remainder were in order.
When the errors were
discovered, the ballots were
withdrawn for correction and the
election postponed. No errors on
the corrected ballot have as yet
been brought to my attention.
Insufficient Postage
The 9econd mistake was a
failure to use sufficient postage to
mail the second set of overseas
ballots. Some, though not all,
were returned. A new mailing was
made and will probably require

two weeks or more to return.
Until the results are received from
the overseas campuses, the ballots
cannot be counted and have been
stored in the safe.
One accusation that has been
made is that illegal electioneering
occurred near the polls contrary
to the By-Laws of the Association
and that the Elections appearing in
the national figuress
Commissioner failed to prevent it.
Such irregularities are the fault of
those candidates who perpetrated
them. If anyone has evidence of
violations of election rules, he
should present the information to
the Student Judicial Council
which has responsibility for
disciplinary action.
Student Dishonesty
Another criticism made of the
Elections Commissioner related to
voting by students outside of their
constituency. I simply cannot see
how the dishonesty of some
students can be blamed on the
Commissioner. The only means to
prevent such acts is to check each
person's name against a computer
print-out of students by
department. The cost of such a
procedure is the additional time
required for voting, which in turn
reduces the total of votes cast.
The computer sign-out method
was resorted to out of necessity
only when it became clear that
students could not be trusted to
give an honest answer to the
question of which division they
were in.
Other allegations have been
made which go far beyond the
legitimate criticisms and
attempted to argue that the
irregularities were intentional
attempts to benefit candidates
supported by the Black Students
Union. The charge was based on
the fact that a full page ad for

these candidates was not run
during the first election when its
impact would have been wasted
and the delayed election offered a
second chance.The ad, originally
scheduled for Thursday, was
withdrawn by the Daily staff
when they were told the election
was postponed until the following
week. The author of the charge
