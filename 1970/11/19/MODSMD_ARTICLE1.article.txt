# Wine Warms Cold Wait For Rose Bowl Tickets
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The first small groups of students
began arriving at 1 a.m., yesterday
morning. With the companionship of
beer, wine, books, and playing cards,
they waited 14 hours to purchase
tickets for 50-yard-line seats at the
Rose Bowl.
Late comers straggled in at
dinnertime Wednesday, and waited 15
or 20 minutes to get goal-line seats.
And thousands passed through the
ticket lines between the first and the
last.
The few early groups climbed over
the wire fences at Roscoe Maples
Pavilion before the gates were opened
in the morning, to get themselves a
little closer to the 50. According to
Ticket Manager Ted Garros, the first
1,6 00 students through the ticket
booths would get the 50 -yard line seats.
The greatest influx of students into
the three lines outside the Pavilion
came shortly after lunchtime. Dozens
of students worked in shifts, some
holding places in the line throughout
the morning, to be relieved by friends
in the afternoon.
Liquor, food, card games, footballs
and frisbees were very much in
evidence throughout the wait. The
blankets that had covered those who
stayed overnight were discarded as the
early morning fog burned off.

It was not a day for stereotypes, as
every sort of Stanford student
imaginable—radicals and clean-cut
business school students, fraternity
men and women's libertarionists—stood
and waited for the lines to move.
A small group of radical students
posed for Daily photographers and sold
buttons reading "Go Reds, Smash
State" to all comers.
A clean-cut business school student,
briefcase in hand, looked up at the
Pavilion as he entered its gates, and
murmured, "Who was Roscoe Maples,
anyway?"
Few complaints at the length of the
wait were heard—most students had
apparently steeled themselves for a long
stay. A small number of students were
observed cutting in at the front of one
of the three lines, but most in the
labyrinthine lines seemed content to
wait their turn.
Some of the lines bunched up more
than others, resulting in longer waits
for some students who cheerfully
thought they were joining a shorter
line. In one case, a student who had
arrived at 2 p.m. and a student who had
arrived at 4:15 both emerged at 5:30
with tickets for seats in the same area.
Late last night officials still had no
word on the number of tickets sold.
Word should be released this afternoon.
