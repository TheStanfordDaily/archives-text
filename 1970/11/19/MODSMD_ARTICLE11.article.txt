# Gaieties 'Surprisingly Good'
## 
### NEIL ARNET 
Tuesday night Ram's Head previewed the 19 70
Gaieties production of "Couples Only," a musical
written by John M. Trowbridge and directed by Jay
Morris. TTie official opening was last night. At the
outset, let me say that the show I saw was actually a
final dress rehearsal. It came off well, and I'll
assume that some of the obvious technical and stage
problems were corrected so that the opening was
even better.
"Couples Only" is similar to other Gaieties in
that it does include as a minor element the mythical
"Stanford dolly," brilliantly played by Teri Brown
(who I might add is not at all plastic in real life).
But the similarity ends there, for "Couples Only"
doesn't deal with Big Games or football games at all.
Rather the show portrays the romantic problem of
two homosexuals living in the Stanford community.
Bill Putnam plays Jack Townsend, a sensitive,
concerned, corrying young man who happens to be
a homosexual, and Rich Reitman portrays Bruce,
Jack's lover whose life is suddenly changed when his
parents suffer financial ruin. Both perform well
throughout the show. Indeed, it is actually Bill
Putnam who carries the show.
The best part of this show is its music, and
there's a lot of it, fifteen different numbers in all.
The music itself is almost all good, though the
singing isn't always the best. Fortunately, Bill
Putnam, who has a fine voice, sings in a large
portion of the numbers. I particularly like his
performance of "So Many Changes," which contains
the best words of any of the musical numbers.
As I said, the music is the best part of this show.
In general the dialogue is weak, often incorporating
some awful puns. But, of course, awful puns are
part of the spirit of Big Game Gaieties. And
occasionally there are even some very funny lines
thrown in by people with small parts. Chuck
Passantino, as a fag in a queer bar, is priceless.

Kathy Ogata, who appears in a couple of small
parts, also utters at least two notable funny
one-liners, and Teri Brown as "dolly" Barb along
with Dan Kolkey as the hustling, "all-American"
Howard, are entertaining.
The show, of course, does have problems. The
slower-moving scenes, those which contain little
singing and a lot of talking, or simply movement,
tend to be rather boring. However, there aren't too
many of these, so the audience interest tends to be
maintained by the larger number of fast-moving
scenes containing well-paced songs. Several of these
songs utilize a chorus, which though lacking
somewhat in singing talent, makes up for it in
enthusiasm and zest. Two of these songs,
"Springtime" and "Cable Car" are quite enjoyable.
Another good song, which probably should be
described as "cute" in keeping with Gaieties
tradition, is "Co-ed Dormitory," performed by Bill,
Rich, and Teri. "Trouble with Lovers," the opening
number performed by Randy Bales and Tom
Fleming in addition to Bill Putnam isn't bad either.
Yet, to me, the best number overall is the
opening one of the second act entitled, "Boy's
Night Out." It's fast, well-sung, choreographed quite
adequately, and a fine musical number to watch.
Well, let me see if I can put this all together now.
The Gaieties never has been, is not now, and never
will be the greatest musical show around. But it isn't
supposed to be. These shows are presented with a
lot of work forced into a short amount of time so
that students outside Ram's Head can be
entertained at Big Game time. This year the
production has taken on a somewhat more serious
tone wihtout altogether shunning foolishness. And
it is done well. John Trowbridge has written a very
enjoyable musical, the songs of which make this a
successful Gaieties production. I suggest you go see
"Couples Only," especially if you've never seen the
Gaieties before. And go with the spirit of enjoying
it. I did.
