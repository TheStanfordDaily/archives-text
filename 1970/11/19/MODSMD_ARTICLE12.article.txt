# Poloists Vie For Third
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity water polo
team travels to Berkeley today to
vie for a third place finish in
conference play. Both squads have
a 1 -4 league record.
Earlier this season, Stanford
outlasted the Bears 9-8 in double
overtime. Since then, neither the
Indians nor the Bears has met
with much success against UCLA
or USC. Cal did squeak past Troy
in their last home conference
game, 10-8, to pick up their only
conference triumph.
Last Friday, the Cardinals
boosted their over-all season log
to 15-6 by whipping San Jose
State 9 -6.
Coach Jim Gaughran called
Stanford's performance "one of
the best all-round games this
year."
Leading the team in scoring
was junior Rick Massimino with
six tallies. Mike Davis tossed in
two and Bill Simpkins also scored
a goal.
Coach Gaughran credited
goalie Peter Gadd with an
excellent game in the net. Holding

the Spartans to two goals in the
first half, Gadd also made a great
save on a SJ State penalty shot.
"Pete played very well. He
stopped another big penalty
throw. And he's played

outstanding polo all year,"
Gaughran said,
Randy Wilkins was also a
standout on the defense as the
Indians never trailed at the end of
any period.

NOT QUlTEâ€”Linebacker Mike Simone (50) moves in on Air Force
quarterback Bob Parker in Stanford's 31 -14 loss last week in Colorado
Springs. Parker, however, had already gotten his pass off. The loss
dropped the Cards to 11th in both national polls. The Falcons, who
went into the game ranked 12 th, came out 10 th in one and eighth in
the other, and won an invitation to the Sugar Bowl.
