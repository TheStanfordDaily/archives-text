Disaster Relief Delayed
DACCA East Pakistan — A question of which
country's pilots should fly relief helicopters has
delayed delivery of urgently needed aircraft from the
United States and Britain, Pakistani relief officials
said yesterday.
At the same time, the United States announced
the most massive direct government aid program—a
$10 million program of emergency food supplies,
disbursement of American counterpart funds in
Pakistan and reimbursement of direct dollar relief
costs.
International Red Cross officials in Geneva said
the largest pledge of help through their
organization—sl.24 million— came from Red China.
The Pakistani officials said their government
wanted the United States and Britain to provide the
aircraft for use by Pakistani pilots. But Washington
refused to go along, the officials said, so Pakistan
backed down and the helicopters were expected to
arrive late Thursday.
Two small American helicopters were expected
Thursday afternoon from Katmandu and a military
cargo plane was to bring in four Huey choppers
Thursday night, shortly after an American chartered
DCB carrying five tons of blankets and tents for
survivors of the disastrous storm and tidal wave that
claimed at least 55,000 lives on the Bay of Bengal
coast last Friday.
Unofficial estimates of the dead ranged from
300,000 to 650,000, but Pakistan's relief
commissioner, A. M. Anisuzzaman, said he could
neither confirm nor challenge the grim calculation.
$1 Billion Aid Increase
WASHINGTON — President Nixon asked Congress
yesterday to add $1 billion to the $2.8 billion he had
requested earlier for foreign aid in this fiscal year.

First indications were that the request faces a rocky
legislative road.
About half the added funds asked in a special
message to Congress would go to help Israel build its
military potential. Neighboring Arab states of Jordan
and Lebanon are down for $30 million and $5 million
respectively for what White House aides described as
internal security needs in those countries.
Apart from Israel, major sums would go to
Cambodia, South Korea and South Vietnam.
Nixon described the money as necessary to carry
out plans for reducing direct U.S. military
commitments abroad while increasing the ability of
allies to defend themselves.
White House officials conceded, however, that part
of the need for more money traces to the U.S.
intervention in Cambodia and to events in the Middle
East.
In addition, he asked for $100 million to restore
funds "to such vital programs as those for Taiwan,
Greece and Turkey" that had been diverted to
Cambodia last spring. About $5 2 million of the
diversion had not been disclosed before.
El Capitan Scaled
YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK, Calif. - Two hardy
mountain climbers struggled triumphantly to the top
of El Capitan just before noon yesterday, completing
in 27 days the first conquest of the sheer 3,000-foot
southeast face of the giant rock sentinel over-looking
Yosemite Valley.
Warren Harding, 46, and Dean Caldwell,27, had a
relatively easy climb up the last 400 sloping feet to
the summit after their perilous scaling of the vertical
cliff. El Capitan itself is 7,400 feet above sea level.

The men began their dangerous ascent October 23,
carrying all of their supplies of food, water, ropes,
steel pitons, hand drills, hammers and sleeping bags.
During the record climb, in which they spurned a
rescue attempt last Friday, the men said they both
took falls of 4 0 to 5 0 feet but that each was saved by
his partner's rope.
My Lai Trials Continue
FT. BENNING, Ga. — A former combat
photographer testified yesterday at the court-martial
of Lt. William Galley Jr. that he saw unarmed
Vietnamese men, women, children and babies slain at
My Lai. However, the prosecution made no attempt
to connect the testimony to Calley.
FT. HOOD, Tex. — The star defense witness in the
court-martial of Sgt. David Mitchell testified
yesterday he helped push Vietnamese civilians into a
drainage ditch at My Lai and saw the men who
allegedly shot into the ditch, but he did not list
Mitchell among them.
The defense said it wanted the testimony of only
one more man—Lt. William L. Calley Jr. There was no
indication whether the Army would permit Calley to
leave Ft. Benning, Georgia, where he is being
court-martialed on charges of murdering 102 South
Vietnamese civilians at My Lai.
Frazier KO's Foster
DETROIT, Mich. — Joe Frazier, a brutal punching
machine, floored Bob Foster twice with vicious left
hooks and scored a second-round knockout last night
in successful defense of his world heavyweight
championship that set up a possible $10 million
dream fight with Muhammad Ali.
The time was 49 seconds of the second round.
