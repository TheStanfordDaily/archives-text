# Big Game Then And Now
## Bitter Rivalry Slowly Mellowing 
### BILL CLASTER 
Big Game 1950! Students on both the Cal and Stanford
campuses are really keyed for the "Big One" on Saturday.
A week full of pranks ard rallies will be culminuated the
night before the game with super-big rallies and bonfires.
Whoopee.
Twenty years later, things have changed a bit. There are
still some pranks, but now they are fewer and done with
very little seriousness. And the bonfires and rallies will go

on, but now the excitement stems from fewer people and a
lot less enthusiasm.
The rivalry which used to be a bitter struggle between
studen's from the two schools is now largely gone. The
game <s really just an athletic contest, which at least for this
year has to be overshadowed by the USC and UCLA games
and ol course the Rose Bowl.
Alumni Excitement
The rivalry now instead seems to be one between the
alumni of the two schools. As one alumnus said, "They are
the ones who really get excited about the Big Game. It's a
social thing for them. They use it as an excuse to get
together. Frankly, this is the beauty of the game. Nobody
cares whether we win or lose as long as they get to the
game and have a good time."
Another alumnus commented on the deemphasizing of
student rivalry. "Students today are concerned over too
many other things to really worry about a rivalry out of the

past. After the war ended in 19 45 , Big Game spirit was at
its highest level."
"Everyone had just gone through four long years of war,
and they needed something simple-minded like the Big
Game rivalry. People were tired of being serious and just
wanted to have fun."
Not So Big
Other people, especially students seem a lot more
low-keyed than this. A student who has been at both
schools in the last few years agrees. "A Big Game victory
for either school would be exciting to the students, but
certainly not more than a win over USC."
In and of itself, this lack of importance of the Big Game
as a crucial contest is part of the cause. The Big Game has
not decided the Rose Bowl bid since 1958 . And at least one
footballer felt that the game would be important because
it's the last game before the Rose Bowl and not because the
opponent is Cal.
The only real spirit has been generated by the Band. One
band member said, "We are the spirit on the campus."
Another said, "There will probably be a lot more spirits
than spirit this weekend. The Big Game is mainly a social
event for everyone."
Socially Big
"It's a big weekend, as students go from the bonfire to
following the Band to the City, to the game and then to the
parties afterwards. For most students, the game is basically
an event around which a lot of fun things are planned."
The Big Game has not died. It is socially significant at
least to the Alumni and while not as big as USC and UCLA,
it is still usually a good football game. What really has died
is the heated rivalry of the past between the two schools.

Socially Big
"It's a big weekend, as students go from the bonfire to
following the Band to the City, to the game and then to the
parties afterwards. For most students, the game is basically
an event around which a lot of fun things are planned."
The Big Game has not died. It is socially significant at
least to the Alumni and while not as big as USC and UCLA,
it is still usually a good football game. What really has died
is the heated rivalry of the past between the two schools.
Big Game 1950! Students on both the Cal and Stanford
campuses are really keyed for the "Big One" on Saturday.
A week full of pranks ard rallies will be culminuated the
night before the game with super-big rallies and bonfires.
Whoopee.
Twenty years later, things have changed a bit. There are
still some pranks, but now they are fewer and done with
very little seriousness. And the bonfires and rallies will go

Commentary

on, but now the excitement stems from fewer people and a
lot less enthusiasm.
The rivalry which used to be a bitter struggle between
studen's from the two schools is now largely gone. The
game <s really just an athletic contest, which at least for this
year has to be overshadowed by the USC and UCLA games
and ol course the Rose Bowl.
Alumni Excitement
The rivalry now instead seems to be one between the
alumni of the two schools. As one alumnus said, "They are
the ones who really get excited about the Big Game. It's a
social thing for them. They use it as an excuse to get
together. Frankly, this is the beauty of the game. Nobody
cares whether we win or lose as long as they get to the
game and have a good time."
Another alumnus commented on the deemphasizing of
student rivalry. "Students today are concerned over too
many other things to really worry about a rivalry out of the

past. After the war ended in 19 45 , Big Game spirit was at
its highest level."
"Everyone had just gone through four long years of war,
and they needed something simple-minded like the Big
Game rivalry. People were tired of being serious and just
wanted to have fun."
Not So Big
Other people, especially students seem a lot more
low-keyed than this. A student who has been at both
schools in the last few years agrees. "A Big Game victory
for either school would be exciting to the students, but
certainly not more than a win over USC."
In and of itself, this lack of importance of the Big Game
as a crucial contest is part of the cause. The Big Game has
not decided the Rose Bowl bid since 1958 . And at least one
footballer felt that the game would be important because
it's the last game before the Rose Bowl and not because the
opponent is Cal.
The only real spirit has been generated by the Band. One
band member said, "We are the spirit on the campus."
Another said, "There will probably be a lot more spirits
than spirit this weekend. The Big Game is mainly a social
event for everyone."
