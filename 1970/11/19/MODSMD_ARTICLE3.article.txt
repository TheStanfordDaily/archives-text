# Medical Research, Training Suffer As Schools Feel Financial Squeeze
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Medical schools all across the
country are feeling the same financial
squeeze as their parent institutions.
Although Stanford's Department of
Medicine has not yet had to resort to
the drastic measures being taken by
other schools to cope with their fiscal
woes, the Department is "feeling the
pinch along with pveryone else,"
according to its Controller, William
Rowland.
The cause of the medical school
financial crisis is virtually the same
throughout the country. Institutions
are faced with rapidly rising costs at a
time when the level of their federal
support is uncertain or, in some cases,
curtailed.
One of the schools hardest hit is
New York Medical College. It required
a $500,000 Federal distress loan to
break even this year even though it
mortgaged property for $10,000,000
and is spending $6,000,000 in
endowment money.
May Close
In Washington D.C., Georgetown
University and George Washington
University say that their medical
schools may close unless Congress
appropriates money to cover their
combined $3.4 million deficits.
The St. Louis University Medical
School may not admit a first year class
in 1971, according to Dean Robert H.
Felix. The department is now surviving
on funds freed by the closing of the
University's dental, aviation technology
and engineering schools.
The strength of a 70-year reputation
has not spared the John Hopkins
University School of Medicine from the
financial crisis. This year its anticipated
deficit will reach $2,234,000. "If you
take the most conservative view, we
could only continue a few years at the

present rate," says Dr. Lincoln Gordon,
the University's president. The dean of
the Medical School comments, "It may
take the closing of several medical
schools to get the attention of the
(Nixon) Administration."
Control
Rowland hopes the Stanford
Department of Medicine will not have
to mortgage property or liquidate
portions of its endowment. "That looks
like a dead-end street to me," he
explains. "We don't want to wait until
we are so far gone that there's no
chance of recovery. We'll have to

control our expenses and cutback our
budget to insure our existence.
The uncertainty of federal funding
policy remains the primary problem
facing Medical School administrators.
Particularly threatened are aid to
students, loan programs and teaching
grants.
This uncertainty is particularly
troublesome when faced with the
nature of the Medical School. "We're
an ongoing organization," says
Rowland. "We've got personnel and
plant commitments of long duration."
Roughly half of the School's $23

million budget comes from federal
funds. This $23 million represents
about 20 percent of the total
University budget.
Cutbacks
One of the major targets of federal
cutbacks is research. The National
Institute of Health (NIH) research
funds of nearly every Medical School
investigator have been slashed 15-20
percent, according to Rowland. Dr.
Norman Kretchmer, professor of
pediatrics and a well-known researcher,
believes the reductions have been as
high as 30 percent for many projects.
Investigative medicine must also
cope with the changing emphasis of
federal appropriations. The trend seems
to be towards less money for research
and more for delivery of medical care.
Dr. Kretchmer has strong views
about this "pendular" type of policy.
"My attitude is that it's not wrong to
spend more on delivery of medical
care,"' he comments, "but that caution
must be taken so that research efforts
are not threatened."
Skeletal research programs have
forced the curtailment of training
programs, a development which
Kretchmer sees as particularly ominous.
"What is happening is that the research
group is getting older and older. As a
citizen, I fear that in 10 years this
country will facc a research manpower
shortage," he warns.
Shortage
A shortage of physicians already
exists. It is said that the United States
needs 50,000 more doctors than it has
today. Ironically, government pleas for
medical schools to increase their
enrollments have helped create the
current financial crisis.
Rowland states, "We've expanded
our classes, and the federal government
has granted funds to assist the
expansion, but they refuse to give
credit for funds spent in anticipation of
the actual expansion."

The future of American medical
schools, like the influx of the federal
money on which they depend, is
uncertain. "In the long run there will
be funding from public and private
sources," Rowland believes, "and the
strength of public demand will
determine the amount from public
sources."
But what of the immediate future,
when some schools may actually close
for lack of funds? And what of the
needs of research, about which the
public is less cognizant? These
unanswered questions reflect a crisis
which could effect the state of health
of the entire nation.

New York Medical College. It required
a $500,000 Federal distress loan to
break even this year even though it
mortgaged property for $10,000,000
and is spending $6,000,000 in
endowment money.
May Close
In Washington D.C., Georgetown
University and George Washington
University say that their medical
schools may close unless Congress
appropriates money to cover their
combined $3.4 million deficits.
The St. Louis University Medical
School may not admit a first year class
in 1971, according to Dean Robert H.
Felix. The department is now surviving
on funds freed by the closing of the
University's dental, aviation technology
and engineering schools.
The strength of a 70-year reputation
has not spared the John Hopkins
University School of Medicine from the
financial crisis. This year its anticipated
deficit will reach $2,234,000. "If you
take the most conservative view, we
could only continue a few years at the

present rate," says Dr. Lincoln Gordon,
the University's president. The dean of
the Medical School comments, "It may
take the closing of several medical
schools to get the attention of the
(Nixon) Administration."
Control
Rowland hopes the Stanford
Department of Medicine will not have
to mortgage property or liquidate
portions of its endowment. "That looks
like a dead-end street to me," he
explains. "We don't want to wait until
we are so far gone that there's no
chance of recovery. We'll have to

control our expenses and cutback our
budget to insure our existence.
The uncertainty of federal funding
policy remains the primary problem
facing Medical School administrators.
Particularly threatened are aid to
students, loan programs and teaching
grants.
This uncertainty is particularly
troublesome when faced with the
nature of the Medical School. "We're
an ongoing organization," says
Rowland. "We've got personnel and
plant commitments of long duration."
Roughly half of the School's $23

million budget comes from federal
funds. This $23 million represents
about 20 percent of the total
University budget.
Cutbacks
One of the major targets of federal
cutbacks is research. The National
Institute of Health (NIH) research
funds of nearly every Medical School
investigator have been slashed 15-20
percent, according to Rowland. Dr.
Norman Kretchmer, professor of
pediatrics and a well-known researcher,
believes the reductions have been as
high as 30 percent for many projects.
Investigative medicine must also
cope with the changing emphasis of
federal appropriations. The trend seems
to be towards less money for research
and more for delivery of medical care.
Dr. Kretchmer has strong views
about this "pendular" type of policy.
"My attitude is that it's not wrong to
spend more on delivery of medical
care,"' he comments, "but that caution
must be taken so that research efforts
are not threatened."
Skeletal research programs have
forced the curtailment of training
programs, a development which
Kretchmer sees as particularly ominous.
"What is happening is that the research
group is getting older and older. As a
citizen, I fear that in 10 years this
country will facc a research manpower
shortage," he warns.
Shortage
A shortage of physicians already
exists. It is said that the United States
needs 50,000 more doctors than it has
today. Ironically, government pleas for
medical schools to increase their
enrollments have helped create the
current financial crisis.
Rowland states, "We've expanded
our classes, and the federal government
has granted funds to assist the
expansion, but they refuse to give
credit for funds spent in anticipation of
the actual expansion."

The future of American medical
schools, like the influx of the federal
money on which they depend, is
uncertain. "In the long run there will
be funding from public and private
sources," Rowland believes, "and the
strength of public demand will
determine the amount from public
sources."
But what of the immediate future,
when some schools may actually close
for lack of funds? And what of the
needs of research, about which the
public is less cognizant? These
unanswered questions reflect a crisis
which could effect the state of health
of the entire nation.

QUIET FOR NOW—The Medical School Library is a serene study spot for the
moment, but med students will start to feel the financial pinch if the current fiscal
crisis continues. Schools around the country have been fighting for survival by
making drastic cutbacks in research and training programs.
Medical schools all across the
country are feeling the same financial
squeeze as their parent institutions.
Although Stanford's Department of
Medicine has not yet had to resort to
the drastic measures being taken by
other schools to cope with their fiscal
woes, the Department is "feeling the
pinch along with pveryone else,"
according to its Controller, William
Rowland.
The cause of the medical school
financial crisis is virtually the same
throughout the country. Institutions
are faced with rapidly rising costs at a
time when the level of their federal
support is uncertain or, in some cases,
curtailed.

on funds freed by the closing of the
University's dental, aviation technology
and engineering schools.
The strength of a 70-year reputation
has not spared the John Hopkins
University School of Medicine from the
financial crisis. This year its anticipated
deficit will reach $2,234,000. "If you
take the most conservative view, we
could only continue a few years at the

present rate," says Dr. Lincoln Gordon,
the University's president. The dean of
the Medical School comments, "It may
take the closing of several medical
schools to get the attention of the
(Nixon) Administration."
Control
Rowland hopes the Stanford
Department of Medicine will not have
to mortgage property or liquidate
portions of its endowment. "That looks
like a dead-end street to me," he
explains. "We don't want to wait until
we are so far gone that there's no
chance of recovery. We'll have to

control our expenses and cutback our
budget to insure our existence.
The uncertainty of federal funding
policy remains the primary problem
facing Medical School administrators.
Particularly threatened are aid to
students, loan programs and teaching
grants.
This uncertainty is particularly
troublesome when faced with the
nature of the Medical School. "We're
an ongoing organization," says
Rowland. "We've got personnel and
plant commitments of long duration."
Roughly half of the School's $23

million budget comes from federal
funds. This $23 million represents
about 20 percent of the total
University budget.
Cutbacks
One of the major targets of federal
cutbacks is research. The National
Institute of Health (NIH) research
funds of nearly every Medical School
investigator have been slashed 15-20
percent, according to Rowland. Dr.
Norman Kretchmer, professor of
pediatrics and a well-known researcher,
believes the reductions have been as
high as 30 percent for many projects.
Investigative medicine must also
cope with the changing emphasis of
federal appropriations. The trend seems
to be towards less money for research
and more for delivery of medical care.
Dr. Kretchmer has strong views
about this "pendular" type of policy.
"My attitude is that it's not wrong to
spend more on delivery of medical
care,"' he comments, "but that caution
must be taken so that research efforts
are not threatened."
Skeletal research programs have
forced the curtailment of training
programs, a development which
Kretchmer sees as particularly ominous.
"What is happening is that the research
group is getting older and older. As a
citizen, I fear that in 10 years this
country will facc a research manpower
shortage," he warns.
Shortage
A shortage of physicians already
exists. It is said that the United States
needs 50,000 more doctors than it has
today. Ironically, government pleas for
medical schools to increase their
enrollments have helped create the
current financial crisis.
Rowland states, "We've expanded
our classes, and the federal government
has granted funds to assist the
expansion, but they refuse to give
credit for funds spent in anticipation of
the actual expansion."

The future of American medical
schools, like the influx of the federal
money on which they depend, is
uncertain. "In the long run there will
be funding from public and private
sources," Rowland believes, "and the
strength of public demand will
determine the amount from public
sources."
But what of the immediate future,
when some schools may actually close
for lack of funds? And what of the
needs of research, about which the
public is less cognizant? These
unanswered questions reflect a crisis
which could effect the state of health
of the entire nation.

QUIET FOR NOW—The Medical School Library is a serene study spot for the
moment, but med students will start to feel the financial pinch if the current fiscal
crisis continues. Schools around the country have been fighting for survival by
making drastic cutbacks in research and training programs.
Medical schools all across the
country are feeling the same financial
squeeze as their parent institutions.
Although Stanford's Department of
Medicine has not yet had to resort to
the drastic measures being taken by
other schools to cope with their fiscal
woes, the Department is "feeling the
pinch along with pveryone else,"
according to its Controller, William
Rowland.
The cause of the medical school
financial crisis is virtually the same
throughout the country. Institutions
are faced with rapidly rising costs at a
time when the level of their federal
support is uncertain or, in some cases,
curtailed.
One of the schools hardest hit is
New York Medical College. It required
a $500,000 Federal distress loan to
break even this year even though it
mortgaged property for $10,000,000
and is spending $6,000,000 in
endowment money.
May Close
In Washington D.C., Georgetown
University and George Washington
University say that their medical
schools may close unless Congress
appropriates money to cover their
combined $3.4 million deficits.
The St. Louis University Medical
School may not admit a first year class
in 1971, according to Dean Robert H.
Felix. The department is now surviving
on funds freed by the closing of the
University's dental, aviation technology
and engineering schools.
