# Lag Boathouse Declared Unsafe For Tomorrow's Bonfire Rally
## 
### DON LINDEMANN 
Due to the poor condition of Lake
Lagunita's boathouse, tomorrow's "Big
Game" bonfire rally will be held
entirely on the lake bed.
The two projecting platforms from
the front of the boathouse have already
been removed, according to Pat Shea of
the ASSU Council of Presidents. He
said that the major entrance to the
dock would be fenced off before the
rally.
After an inspection of the boathouse
last month, an engineering firm (Rinne,
Hammond & Peterson) reported that
"the entire structure should be replaced
(or the substructure re-built) as soon as
practicable."
The ASSU, which owns the
boathouse, has arranged for student
police to keep people away from the
remaining platform, which was judged
inadequate for general purposes by the
engineering firm.
The boathouse has suffered from
"severe exposure and wracking caused
by uneven supports as the lake rises and
falls," according to the firm's report.
The boathouse was built in 19.19.
Shea said that repairs are now being
made on the underpinnings of the
building so that it can be used this
spring. But he expected it will be torn
down after this year. A fund-raising
drive would be necessary to build a
replacement.
Swimming protection is also
inadequate at Lagunita, which fills
gradually during winter quarter.
According to Robert Beth, Safety
Manager of the University, there have
been three drownings since the Spring
Of 1969.

"There is a tremendous need for
more lifeguards," said Beth. He
described present lifeguard protection
as "informal" and said there is a lack of
enforcement.
Beth also said lifeguards cannot be
effective unless swimmers are limited to
designated areas. Swimming in

dangerous areas could be controlled by
construction of a hurricane fence
around the lake, but that would cost at
least $15 ,0 00.
Beth suggested that signs be posted
concerning the lake depth. He also said
that boating rules should be established
and enforced.
