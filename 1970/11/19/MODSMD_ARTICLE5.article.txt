# 'political censorship'
## 'Daily' Editors Ignore Reality 
### 
Last night I got stoned with
my woman. Joni Mitchell was on
the stereo. It was very indulgent,
but it was beautiful.
"I'm unhappy," my woman
said.
I looked up from my Mao.
"What?" I said.
"I don't know. Nothing seems
important these days."
"How can you say that?" I
said, trying to prove myself
human after all. "All kinds of
things are important. Bill Cosby is
important. Einstein and rotating
frames are important. A perfectly
angled volley that hits right where

the green and white meet and
spins away is important."
"What the fuck is that?" she
said.
"Embracing someone for no
good reason is important."
"But the U.S. is trying to wipe
out the Vietnamese. The pigs are
trying to wipe out the Black
Panthers. The FBI is investigating
the Revolutionary Union."
"Right, and the Panthers are
trying to do something about it.
They have called for a
Revolutionary People's
Constitutional Convention in
Washington over Thanksgiving.

There will be workshops right
here at Stanford during this week
in preparation for that
convention."
"Far out," she said.

There it is, boys and girls in
Wilbur. Did you dig it? Did you
get beyond the first paragraph?
The editors of the Daily think
that this is all you can handle.
That is why you haven't seen
word one in the Daily about the
Revolutionary People's
Constitutional Convention,
although two people have tried to
get articles printed. And that is
why you are treated to whining
drivel from Jeff Well instead.
You see, the editors of the
Daily think that Stanford students
don't dig rhetoric. They are too
sophisticated. What is rhetoric?
Any mention of imperialism,
fascism, genocide, racism, or
communism. ("Embracing
someone for no good reason is
important" is, of course, sincere
emotion.) Therefore, any article
dealing with any of these
phenomena is rejected because of
style.
But, unfortunately for the
editors of the Daily, the U.S. is
not subjecting Indochina to the
most intense bombardment in

merle rabine

human history because of
rhetoric. Fred Hampton is not
dead and Bobby Seale not facing
the electric chair because of
rhetoric. Ruben Salazar was not
murdered in East Los Angeles
because of rhetoric. People all
over the U.S. are not rising up to
oppose their government and the
interests it represents because of
rhetoric.
These are real things that are
happening in the real world. What
the editors call "rhetoric" is what
I think is calling things by their
real names. This is not a
disagreement about style; it is a
disagreement about politics. By
using the criteria which they
profess, the editors are in fact
imposing political censorship on
what gets into the Daily.
This is most glaringly true of
the treatment of the
Revolutionary People's
Constitutional Convention, which
has a fair shot at being the most
important historical event of
1970. I would like to say more
about the convention and the
need for a new constitution, but I
am afraid that it wouldn't get in
because of "rhetoric." If you
want to find out more about the
Convention, go to the workshops.
They will be announced in the
Daily (maybe).
Merle Rabine is a member of the
Revolutionary Union.)

(Editor's Note: Revolutionary
Union members have twice re
cently asked us to run what
amounted to public relations re
leases on the Revolutionary
Peoples' Convention. We rejected
them not because of their content
but because of their rhetoric.)
