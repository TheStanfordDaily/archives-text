ticket fix
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems absurd that Mr. Roger
Heeler would question the sacred
institution of Stanford University
for being so generous as to give us
11,000 student Rose Bowl tickets
for 12,5 00 students. Profit is the
game. We are fortunate to have
received 11,0 0 0.
Realizing how tight Stanford
is, it's lucky the limit wasn't 1,000
or even 100 tickets. As to where
the other 27,000 tickets go—with
profits in mind—all Mr. Heeler had
to do was turn to page five of the
same issue to read from Unravel

Travel, Inc.—where for a measily
$161.00, one could travel to the
Rose Bowl by boat (however with
no ticket to the game). But there
are many travel agencies that for
$5 00 or less will get one a seat to
the game along with five nights in
a hotel, even if you were only
planning to stay two.
Remember—profit is the game.

no sheep, man

. .you will wonder why there
are all those sheep..
Most, indeed all, of those sheep
are goats. I know this because I
use them (most of them), to
advance human knowledge.
I know this because they smell
like goats. Goats in sheeps'
clothing, so to speak.

baaaa...
Ewe correctly lamb-bast me for
my baad mistake of referring to
your goats as sheep. I wasn't
trying to pull the wool over
anybody's eyes nor was I trying to
get anybody's goat. I hope I will
not flock up like that again.
