# Bonfire Ignites Tomorrow
## 
### 
The 5 0 foot poles reach up toward the sky
from the lake bed, the Cardinals Board is again
pleading with freshmen to help with construction
and the guarding against possible sabotage by
mysterious raiders has begun.
Stanford's annual gift to the pyrotechnics of
America fires up tomorrow night.
Bob Mathias, two-time Olympic Decathlon
winner and Stanford alumnus, will speak at the Big
Game rally and bonfire at 7 p.m. Recently elected
Republican congressman from the Tulare county
(California) area, he played on the 1951 Stanford
Rose Bowl team.
Pacific Gas and Electric and Pacific Telephone
have placed the telephone poles (donated) in the
Lake Lagunita bed and they await actual
construction to begin tomorrow morning at 6.
Tomorrow's rally, held in preparation for the
annual "Big Game" against California Saturday,
features the band, playing their repertoire,
speeches by football team members, and Bob
Mathias.
Pallets and boxes for the construction of the
bonfire have been donated (about 7,000 cubic

yards) and will be collected tomorrow with seven
rented trucks. After construction is completed, the
structure is doused with fuel oil and it is lit at the
conclusion of the rally.
Flames reach a height of about 150 feet and the
bonfire burns all night.
A street dance on Lasuen Road near the Post
Office, sponsored by the Cardinals Board will
follow the rally.
The bonfire costs approximately $1000, $300
of which comes from the athletic budget and the
rest from the Cardinals Board budget. The money
goes for truck rental, crude oil, cleanup, student
police and insurance.
Freshmen, under the direction of Cardinals
Board, are responsible for all the work of guarding
and building the bonfire.
Big Game pranks opened with paint and broken
glass Sunday night when some California raiders
were trying to do up the campus. For fear of more
attacks, freshmen are guarding the poles night and
day. In the past, Berkeley students have tried to
ignite the conflagration prematurely. The band is
maintaining nightly patrols around the campus to
protect against any hostile action.

REACH FOR THE SKYâ€”Fifty foot telephones look pretty tall from the ground. These poles, sitting in
the middle of a dried up Lake Lagunita, can be seen in flames tomorrow night at the annual Big Game
rally and bonfire.
