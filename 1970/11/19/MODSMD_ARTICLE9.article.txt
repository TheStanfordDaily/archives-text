# Financial Woes Plague 'Daily'
## 
### 
The Daily has been forced to
take a number of economy moves
in the face of past and projected
financial losses.
During the past two years the
newspaper lost $ 2 0,0 00, and early
last week Business Manager
George Guglemann announced
that he projected an $11,000 loss
for this year. And, late last week
Guglemann resigned.

As a result, the editorial staff
in conjunction with the business
office has decided to take these
immediate steps:
—To increase the percentage of
ads in each paper. In other words
each issue will have more
advertising per page, and there
will be four to six fewer pages of
the Daily each week.
—To increase the classified ad

rates from $1.5 0 to $2.00 for two
lines a week.
—To decrease business office
salaries by $1,000 over the
remainder of the year.
—To consolidate Campus
Roundup and OATQ so that there
will be sufficient room in the
paper to run articles of general
interest.
In addition to these new

policies the Daily is considering
three other proposals:
—Increasing the display ad rate
from $1 .95 per column inch to
from $2.20 to $2.50 per column
inch.
—Decreasing the press run by
one or two thousand copies to
eliminate wasted ones that often
remain at the Post Office and
Tresidder Union.
— Eliminating completely
editorial salaries for the remainder
of the year.
Daily co-editor Bill Freivogel
yesterday expressed his hopes that
these economy measures will
insure that the paper not only
avoids going into further debt, but
also that it pays off $3,000 of its
present debt to the ASSU.
"We apologize to our readers
for these cutbacks," he added,
"but we hope that the students
realize they are necessary if the
Daily is to remain a financially
viable campus newspaper."
Guglemann explained that the
losses over the past two years and
the projected loss for this year are
the result of a precipitous drop in
national advertising revenue, and a
concurrent rise in printing costs.
Two years ago national advertising
brought in $31 ,000 and this year
it should only yield $1 4 ,000.
