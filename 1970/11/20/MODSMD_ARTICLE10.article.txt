# 'Peoples' Constitution'
## Pre-Convention Sessions Set 
### PHIL LIND 
A Revolutionary Peoples'
Constitutional Convention has
been called by the Black Panther
Party for November 27-29 in
Washington, D.C.
In preparation for the
convention groups around the
nation have called for preparatory
conferences to allow the
maximum number of people to
participate in the construction of
the constitution.
The Peninsula Workers
Conference will be held tomorrow
at 10 a.m. in Tresidder. It is being
organized by the Workers Action
Caucus and the Telephone
Workers Caucus. All workers in
the area are being invited to
attend.
Bob Griffin of the Workers
Action Caucus will open the first
part of the meeting and introduce
speakers who will set the format
of the conference. After the large
meeting, the group will split up
into seven workshops to discuss
the areas that are to be included
in the new constitution.

According to John Kielch of
the Workers Action Caucus, the
workshops have been selected
"according to what we feel are the
major needs of the people at this
time." The workshops that will
meet include working standards,

living standards, people's
education and culture, liberation
of women, structure of peoples'
government, international
cooperation of workers, and
self-determination of black and
chicano workers.
