# 'Chaparral' Returns At End Of Quarter
## 
### 
"Some good investigative
journalism is in the works" for the
upcoming issue of Chaparral,
according to editor John Shoch.
Although debt waylaid the
magazine last year, keeping it
down to seven issues, the
publication is now solvent.
Chaparral will come out before
the end of the quarter and
reappear every two weeks, the
staff hopes.
Scheduling will be flexible,
Shoch says."It will depend on
our financial position and what

there is to write about."
Content will also be "flexible,"
according to Shoch. "Political
reporting, well-written features,
exposes, music reviews, whatever
comes up," will be found in
Chaparral, he notes.
Recently Chaparral has been
known as a radical publication,
but it was once strictly a humor
magazine. In the past three years,
the magazine has been shifting
toward more varied coverage of
things that interest Stanford
students.
