# 'Abraxas' Explosive

### VICKI LaBRIE 
Santana's newest album
"Abraxas" is bursting with great
sounds, definitely one of the best
albums produced this year.
Everything, from the sound
reproduction to the last guitar
note, is perfect. There isn't a bad
song on the album, all of which
were written by members of the
group except "Black Magic
Woman/Gypsy Queen," "Oye
Como Va," and "Incident at
Neshabur." Their first album was
an innovation on the music scene
and "Abraxas" is a reaffirmation
of our introduction to Latin-rock,
as well as a higher level of musical
ability, technical arranging, and
variety. You don't have to play
the album over and over to
become accustomed to the songs;
you will be overwhelmed the first
time you hear it, submerged in the
throbbing beat and electrifying
light of Carlos Santana's guitar,
Gregg Rolie's vocals and Chepito
Areas' timballes.
The excitement generated by a
live performance is usually lost in
the recording studio, whereas
some groups are plagued with the
unfortunate fact of performing
worse in person than on their
recordings. Santana, an extremely
explosive group in person, loses
none of its spontaneity or

earthiness on "Abraxas." The
album is a prime example of and
comparable to Santana's
distinctive sound and musical
virtuosity in live performance and
studio recording.
The first band "Singing Winds,
Crying Beasts" presents
shimmering metallic breezes ans
shrieking guitar, a smooth yet
piercing introduction of what is to
come, setting the scene for a
mellow mood. "Oye Como Va"
and "Incident at Neshabur" offer
beautiful guitar and organ solos.
"Incident," a song exhibiting a
variety of melodies and moods,
begins with a forceful congo beat,
followed by intricate organ and
guitar solos, and them mellows
out into tender strains by Carlos
Santana.
On the second side, there is a
nice little timballes solo on "Se a
Cabo" and Santana's jazz guitar
theme threads itself through the
whole song. Gregg Rolie wrote
two of the songs on the second
side. "Mother's Daughter" and
"Hope You're Feeling Better" and
does the singing on the pair of
songs. Both are somewhat
commercial-sounding and could
possibly be potential AM hits,
mainly because they have words
you can sing along with, and
"Mother's Daughter" has a guitar
ending that gathers excitement up
to the end. The guitar in "Hope
You're Feeling Better" sounds
reminiscent of Jimi Hendrix'
wah-wah guitar style.

The best song is "Black Magic
Woman/Gypsy Queen" combining
the best of both worlds—excellent
guitar riffs and beautiful
vocalizing. His understated
vocalizing is a fulfilling addition
to the album and the guitar
resolutions in the introduction are
particularly satisfying.
The "Gypsy Queen" part of
the song is instrumental
demonstrating brilliantly
controlled guitar by Carlos
Santana and violent rhythms that
will set your body moving.
However, now that AM radio has
"Black Magic Woman" in its
claws, it may very well suffer the
fate of other decent songs played
on the AM airwaves. Let's hope
not.
I could go on and on,
expostulating on the beautiful
work performed on this album,
but it's impossible to pick out all
the instances of craftsmanship,
and I wouldn't want to; it's not an
a bum to be picked and probed at
till you have the bare bones left.
It must be taken as a whole, each
instrument complimenting the
others; each note, word, and beat
savored together.
"Abraxas" is perfectly
created—the continuity is even,
one song melting into another;
Santana is so together musically,
rhythmically, and professionally,
that "Abraxas" is an exquisite
album you'll never tire of. It will
make you smile.
