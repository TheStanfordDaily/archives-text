## Another Time 
### Fred Leeson 
John Ralston lias lost to Cal only once in his years coaching at
Stanford, and as he goes into his eighth Big Game tomorrow it might
be of interest to reflect on times that were less-all-rosy, like that
26-3 loss to the Bears three years ago.
"Let's admit what everyone knows," said a letter to the editor
afterward. "Coach John is a lousy coach. And let's do something
about it. Let's reject Ralston. DUMP JOHN IN '68." And some of
those alums who had always said well, John beats Cal even if he
doesn't have spectacular season records, were having second thoughts.
"It's not easy to lose to Cal," Ralston said looking back this week.
"I found that out."
A Decision
Before that game in 1967, Ralston had a dilemma to consider. His
first-string quarterback. Chuck Williams, had knee troubles and
couldn't play. His back-up quarterback was an excellent defensive
back and a superb athlete, but he wasn't much of a passer.
Stanford also had a third quarterback that year, a sophomore
redshirt who was said to be able to throw the ball pretty well. Should
Ralston use a year of the redshirt's eligibility in one game to gear up
his offense, beat Cal, and probably finish 6-4 instead of 5-5 [
He didn't.
Mark Marquess started for the Indians and was spelled by the
injured Williams, who ran the club out of a shotgun formation-taking
the snap about four yards behind the center—because he couldn't run.
Stanford got bombed, 26-3, in front of 74,000 in the stadium.
So Ralston had never had a really good year in five attempts and
now he had lost to California, too. That letter to the editor was
indicative of the campus esteem for him.
One of his few defenders was a Daily sports editor (who turned
into a naming rad two years later, incidently) who concluded from
what he had seen, "Ralston is eminently human, and worth keeping at
Stanford."
The Thrilling Climax!
That redshirt quarterback Ralston decided not to use in 1967, if
you haven't guessed already, was Jim Plunkett.
Ralston says the decision not to use a year of Plunkett's eligibility
in that one game was simple. "It was a possibility, of course, but it
went 'bing', just like that. It wouldn't have been fair to Jim."
The pressure at the end of that 1967 season didn't bother him,
Ralston says, because his 1967 team didn't have the material to make
a run at the league championship as he thought his teams in 1966 and
1965 did.
Thermometer Check
As for the criticism, he says, "A coach always has to pay attention
to the adage, 'If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.' To a
lot of people criticism would be disturbing, but to me it's interesting.
"Nobody would think of going up to Dr. Behling(team physician)
and telling him how to do his job, but everybody will come to a coach
and tell him what to do. I don't mind it. At least they're interested in
what's going on."
After three years, Plunkett has broken all the records, Ralston has
put together a big season and the Indians are in the Rose Bowl. The
critics have turned to backslappers—for awhile,
anyway. t
