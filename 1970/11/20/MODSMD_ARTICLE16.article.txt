# Cards Dunk Cal In Season Final
## 
### 
Stanford downed Cal yesterday
in water polo 7-6 and grabbed
third place in league play.
Finishing off their regular season
play with a 1 6-6 record, hopes are
still alive for an NCAA playoff
berth.
In the Indians' second
conference victory over the
hapless Bears, all three of
Stanford's top scorer fouled out.
"The bench came in and won
the game for us," said Coach Jim
Gaughran.

"Our three high scorers—Rick
Massimino, Mike Davis, and Rob
Woolley—all fouled out. The subs
came off the bench and played a
great game," Gaughran said.
With the Indians' big guns out
of the game, the extra load was
placed on goalie Pete Gadd.
"Gadd played another fantastic
game in the goal for us. He
stopped a very crucial penalty
shot late in the game that helped
us win," Gaughran said.


THE CHALLENGER: California's Dave Penhall, who piloted Cal's
spirited comeback last year when the Bears fell to Stanford 29-28 , will
be looking for another upset chance tomorrow in California's
Memorial Stadium. Currently sixth in Pac-8 passing, the Bear
quarterback has completed 100 of 201 passes for 1,5 5 4 yards and
nine touchdowns in 10 games.
