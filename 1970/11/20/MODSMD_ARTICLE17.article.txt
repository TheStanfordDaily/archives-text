# A 						Not So Big Game
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The Big Game. For the 7 3rd
time this Saturday, the Stanford
and Cal football teams will meet
in what has always been called the
Big Game. Somehow the bigness
of the game is reflected more in
the alumni reunions and extra
parties than in the actual
importance of the game.
Stanford's already in the Rose
Bowl and Cal's not in anything
and no one can claim it is
important as say the USC or
UCLA games. But back on the
afternoon of October 17, it
looked like it really might be the
really big game.
Up until the final moments of
their game against UCLA on that

day, Cal appeared as if they would
win. They led 21-18 with less than
two minutes to go when UCLA
got possession deep in their own
territory.
UCLA Game
Aided by two controversial
bump and run pass interference
calls, UCLA drove deep into Cal
territory as time ran out. As the
final seconds elapsed, Dennis
Dummit rolled out from the three
and headed towards the goal line
flag.
An official who trailed the play
instead of viewing it from the goal
line where he should've been,
called it a touchdown. Not many
other people agreed.

The films tended to show that
he had touched his knee on the
two and even the Pac-8
representative who had to rate the
officials in the game admitted to
me he didn't think he scored. "I
don't really think the trajectory
of the ball crossed the plane of
the goal line when his knee
touched, but what could we do
about it?"
To a lot of people it was the
officials who had stolen the game
from the Bears. Cal had now lost
twice in league play and thus lost
all chance of winning a Rose Bowl
bid by beating Stanford, unless
somebody else did so first.
No Roses
As you all know, nobody did,
and Cal added another loss to
Oregon State, so the importance
of the Big Game won't be
increased by it being a battle for
the Rose Bowl.
Still it should, if nothing else,
be a good football game. Stanford
needs a win to gather some
momentum for their Rose Bowl
appearance and Cal (5-5) has the
incentive of finishing with a
winning record.
No team has been more
inconsistent than the Bears. They
lost unbelievably to Rice 28-0 and
only beat San Jose State by seven
a week ago. But they swamped
Washington State 4 5-0 and played
exceptionally well in d-10.
There's no doubt that Cal
has good personnel. Running
backs Stan Murphy and Tim Todd
have gained 1 04 0 yards between
them and their backup man, Isaac-
Curtis is a tremendous breadaway

threat. Quarterback Dave Penhall
has passed for 1 55 4 yards and has
some good receivers, especially
Steve Sweeney who has caught 38
for 61 4 yards.
O.Z. and Sherman
But Cal's defense is the real
key. When they're playing well as
they did against USC, they are
awfully tough. Defensive lineman
O.Z. White and Sherman White
are potentially two of the best in
the conference. Last week against
San Jose, Sherman got to
quarterback Ivan Lippi eight
times.
In the secondary they have two
good performers in Ray
Youngblood and Joe Acker. Only
Oregon has completed more than
5 0 per cent of its passes against
the Bear defense.
But the game may well be
decided by the kickers. Cal's
Randy Wersching is the
conference record holder for
career field goals with 22 out of
40. And Steve Horowitz is only
one behind him.
Injuries
Both teams have some injury
problems with Dave Tipton,
Demea Washington, Ron Kadziel
and Jack Lasater all considered
doubtful for Stanford. For the
Bears, Andy Anderson (dhb)
Kenny Adams (end) and Loren
Toews (lb) will probably miss the
game.
It should be a good and a close
game. A crowd of 75 ,000 is
expected. Too bad the game is
just for the Axe and not the roses
too.
