# Stanford Falls In First Big Toss-Off
## 
### BOB JACOBS 
Hate, blood, vengeance,
destruction. Another foreign war?
The Zetes-Law School football
game? .The Union at noon? No,
the setting was the first
Berkeley-Stanford Big Game Week
Frisbee Tournament held this past
Wednesday afternoon at Cat's
Sproul Plaza. The Indians, putting
forth a valiant and courageous
effort, nevertheless were downed
by the Bears, 3-1. However, the
score belies the incredible nature
of the contest's proceedings.
Cal, Frisbee capital of the
world, staged two-day
eliminations earlier this week to
determine their five finalists.
Among their platter freaks were
the International Frisbee
Association's (IFA) National
Distance Champion, the world's
only living human octopus and
the Berkeley Tac Squad's
champeen baton-wielder.
Stanford recruited its men

Tuesday night, employing the
Farm's traditionally rigid athletic
selection procedure. (The first five
people who recognized the word
"Frisbee" were automatically
chosen.) The five tough men who
represented our school were Rich
Miller, a soph in chem and anthro,
Tim Clock, a junior in Poly Sci,
Bob Sellers, a freshman in general
studies, Bob Jacobs, a sopn also in
general studies and involuntary
captain of the team, and Rex the
Wonder Horse.
1 200 insane Berkeley fans
lined the sides of the main campus
square, enthusiastically
applauding the victors of each of
the four events (accuracy,
distance, accuracy medley and
"guts") while pitilessly booing the
vanquished, all in grand Circus
Maximus tradition.
The match was reputed to be
the first intercollegiate battle of
its kind in this country. At least
Stanford gets its name on the
record books for something.
