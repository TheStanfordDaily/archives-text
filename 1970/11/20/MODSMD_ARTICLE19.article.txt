## Playoffs To Start 
### 
As the football season draws to
an end, pigskin fans look forward
to those annual clashes that often
mark the highlight of an otherwise
dismal season: Stanford-Cal,
USC-UCLA, and the Intramural
League Playoffs. This year's
playoffs begin on Monday,
although all the participants have
yet to be determined.
Seedings for this year's
playoffs are not complete, but
Dave Shaeffer, director of the
league, indicated that the
Dislocations would be top seeds
and the Theta Delts second. Also
sure to be highly ranked are the
KA's, Law 111, and El Toro.
The playoffs comprise all
teams that finish either first or
second in their league. Ties for
second place enable both teams to
go, and League 3 is sending four
teams due to a three-way tie for
second.
The same situation threatens to
occur in League 10. Toro has first

place clinched with a 4-0 record,
but there are three teams in the
running for second place: Tigre,
which has finished the season with
a 3-2 record; Ya Ya, which is 2-1
and has games left with Toro,
which they figure to lose, and
Arcos, which they should win;
and AFNA, which is 2-2 and has
one game remaining with winless
Cuadro.
