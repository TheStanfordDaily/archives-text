# Faculty Canvass Asked On Roles In Disturbances
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Three options have been made
available to faculty members who wish
to assist the University administration
during times of severe campus
disruption.
The Faculty Senate resolved
yesterday to "canvass the membership
of the Academic Council" to discover
which of its members would volunteer
to serve either as observers, monitors,
or members of emergency building
surveillance teams.
One example of observers' duties
would be to provide "detailed and
reliable first-hand information on the
nature,- extent, and gravity of the
disturbance."

Monitors would restrain, moderate,
and otherwise communicate with
individuals involved in the disturbance
"through persistence in rational
dialogue."
Faculty volunteering to serve.on
surveillance teams will have the choice
of keeping watch on Stanford buildings
in general, or on those which house
their own offices.
Emergency Planning
The Steering Committee of the
Senate has advised the president that
the responsibility for emergency
planning and decisions at the time of
emergency "must, inevitably rest with
the Administration."

"To the extent that facuPv
participation is called for," the repoit
continued, ". . . it should whenever
possible be individual, voluntary, and
under the specific direction of
responsible University officers."
It was in response to this advice that
the president requested assistance from
faculty members in the three forms
listed above.
In other actions, the Senate
unanimously by voice vote, approved a
report from its Committee on
Committees (CoC) on the question of
Community Self-Discipline. The report,
compiled by a task force of the CoC,
details ten recommendations for the
improvement of community discipline.
The recommendations will be
forwarded to President Lyman, the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and the Committee of 15
(C-15).
Alterations Asked
The CoC task force's report cited
"very mixed opinions" among the
community respecting the effectiveness
of the C-15, SCLC, SJC, and the
informal Consultative Committee on
Campus disruption.
It went on to state that it had
rejected the idea of scrapping the
existing campus mechanisms in favor of
formulating new ones, as "it is not
obvious that an alternative would bean
improvement; nor is there time
avialable for the development of an
alternative if the present system is
scrapped first.
"If the present system cannot be made
to work, alternatives not involving
self-government would very likely be
imposed," it added.
One of the ten recommendations
asked that the SJC's procedural rules be
amended to allow for the hearing of
certain cases by "small subsets of SJC
members."
Another recommends that the

University president exercise his
authority "to promulgate temporary
legislation in those areas where the urgent
need for rules can be forseen."
A third action, the senate heard and
adopted unanimously, a report from the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS) containing regulations on the
academic standing of undergraduates. In
essence, these regulations provide a new
means for making academic counseling
and advising available to those students
not making satisfactory academic
progress at the University.

listed above.
In other actions, the Senate
unanimously by voice vote, approved a
report from its Committee on
Committees (CoC) on the question of
Community Self-Discipline. The report,
compiled by a task force of the CoC,
details ten recommendations for the
improvement of community discipline.
The recommendations will be
forwarded to President Lyman, the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC), the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and the Committee of 15
(C-15).
Alterations Asked
The CoC task force's report cited
"very mixed opinions" among the
community respecting the effectiveness
of the C-15, SCLC, SJC, and the
informal Consultative Committee on
Campus disruption.
It went on to state that it had
rejected the idea of scrapping the
existing campus mechanisms in favor of
formulating new ones, as "it is not
obvious that an alternative would bean
improvement; nor is there time
avialable for the development of an
alternative if the present system is
scrapped first.
"If the present system cannot be made
to work, alternatives not involving
self-government would very likely be
imposed," it added.
One of the ten recommendations
asked that the SJC's procedural rules be
amended to allow for the hearing of
certain cases by "small subsets of SJC
members."
Another recommends that the

University president exercise his
authority "to promulgate temporary
legislation in those areas where the urgent
need for rules can be forseen."
A third action, the senate heard and
adopted unanimously, a report from the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
(CUS) containing regulations on the
academic standing of undergraduates. In
essence, these regulations provide a new
means for making academic counseling
and advising available to those students
not making satisfactory academic
progress at the University.
Three options have been made
available to faculty members who wish
to assist the University administration
during times of severe campus
disruption.
The Faculty Senate resolved
yesterday to "canvass the membership
of the Academic Council" to discover
which of its members would volunteer
to serve either as observers, monitors,
or members of emergency building
surveillance teams.
One example of observers' duties
would be to provide "detailed and
reliable first-hand information on the
nature,- extent, and gravity of the
disturbance."

Monitors would restrain, moderate,
and otherwise communicate with
individuals involved in the disturbance
"through persistence in rational
dialogue."
Faculty volunteering to serve.on
surveillance teams will have the choice
of keeping watch on Stanford buildings
in general, or on those which house
their own offices.
Emergency Planning
The Steering Committee of the
Senate has advised the president that
the responsibility for emergency
planning and decisions at the time of
emergency "must, inevitably rest with
the Administration."

"To the extent that facuPv
participation is called for," the repoit
continued, ". . . it should whenever
possible be individual, voluntary, and
under the specific direction of
responsible University officers."
It was in response to this advice that
the president requested assistance from
faculty members in the three forms
listed above.
