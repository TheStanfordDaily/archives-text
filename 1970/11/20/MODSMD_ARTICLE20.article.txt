# Pressure On D.A. Results In McGuire Probation Hearing
## 
### 
Diarmuid McGuire's probation may be
revokedâ€”apparently as a direct result of
pressure placed on the Santa Clara
County District Attorney by Ray White
in the form of a letter from his lawyer to
the district attorney's office.
According to District Attorney Roger
Bourke, the McGuire matter came to his
attention when White's lawyer contacted
his office. Since then the DA's office has
scheduled a hearing December 4, to
determine whether a column McGuire
wrote for the Daily violated his
probation.
McGuire said that his probation board
had not felt that the column constituted
a violation of his probation, and that the
District Attorney had gone over the head
of the probation board to obtain a
hearing before a judge. Bourke said that
while it is not normal for the DA's office
to become involved, it has occasionally
done so before.
White doesn't think the district
attorney would have done anything
without his pressure. "It got them off
their fat asses," he said. However, he
doubts whether the probation hearing
will result in any action. "It's a quasi-legal
thing, instead of going to court over the
charges."
McGuire considers his sentence
politically motivated. "The three-years
probation is clearly an attempt to inhibit
me from being politically active,"
McGuire said. "The whole probation

system is being used to suppress Third
World people, and the Anti-Imperialist
movement in this area."
MeGuire charges that the probation
hearing was a response to University
pressure concerning the column.
James V. Siena, Legal Adviser to

President Lyman, told the Daily, "I know
of no University pressure or involvement.
No one in the University has been asked
for views, nor have volunteered any views
on the matter." Bourke indicated that
there has been no pressure on him from
the University.
