# Travelling Band Plays 'Off-Broadway' Stand
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The Stanford Band, reputed to be
faster than a Board of Supervisors, more
powerful than a union lobby, and able to
leap waterfront towers with a single
bound, will invade San Francisco tonight
with fight songs, rock music and off-color
yells.
The traditional appearance of the band
and Dollies, which climaxes Big Game
week festivities, begins with a series of
alumni rallies. Next, Drum Major Geordie
Lawry will lead a march through San
Francisco which could afford the parade's
followers their only chance to see a
topless dancer writhe to the William Tell
Overture.
After playing at the Freshman Bonfire
until 7:30 p.m., the bandsmen will be
transported to the steps of the Fairmont
Hotel in San Francisco. ETA is 9 p.m.
The Crystal Room and the Pavillion
Room, containing the classes of '25 and
'30, will be the scene of the band's first
two concerts.
Then, at 9:45, the Mark Hopkins and
the class of '4 5 will be treated to the
famed musical questions of the 1 40 piece

band. All of this within the confines of
the Peacock Courtyard.
From here, it's all downhill, at least
until the band reaches Union Square,
where, after a brief but devastating
performance, that long-awaited journey
to North Beach will begin.
If the recent history of Big Game week
visits is any indication of things to come,
only those who are expecting to be
disappointed will be disappointed.
Last year, no fewer than 2,000
spectators accompanied the band to the
"Off Broadway," and witnessed a
dazzling display of dirty dancing. A taxi
cab was so overwhelmed by the frenzy
that its roof caved in. Moments later, the
band was confronted by the SFPD and
notified that it constituted an unlawful
assembly. The band played "Revolution."
This year, no taxi cabs and a police
escort.
This year also, in addition to the "Off
Broadway," and at the request of the
management, the band will play a free
concert at the Condor. (What Lola wants,

year, and while it may not be a
