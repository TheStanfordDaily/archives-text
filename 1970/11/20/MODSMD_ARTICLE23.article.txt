# In House Action
## Trade Bill Passed 
### 
WASHINGTON - Ignoring last-ditch
Nixon administration efforts to kick
foreign shoe and other quotas out of a
controversial trade bill, the House passed
and sent it to the Senate yesterday with
some opponents urging the President to
veto it.
The vote was 215 to 165.
Rep. Donald M. Fraser, D—Minn., told
the House a State Department
aide—saying she was "calling on behalf of
the White House"—urged him to support
a motion essentially to return the bill to
President Nixon's original request a year
ago.
But the motion—to strip the bill to
quotas against foreign textiles and a tax
break for U.S. exporters aimed at
encouraging a bigger outflow of U.S.
goods—was never even introduced.
Under the tight rule under which the
House considered the bill, opponents got
only one chance to offer a blanket
motion to try to revise it.
New Quotas Added
Rep. Harold R. Collier, R—lll., moved
to send the bill back to the Ways and
Means Committee with no instructions on
what to do with it. This was defeated 206
to 173.
The bill adds quotas on shoes and
textiles, perpetuates them on oil and
provides quotas on other foreign goods
when competing U.S. industries can prove
injury.
Rep. Paul Findley, R— 111., said he
hoped that a show of strength would
encourage President Nixon to kill the bill
if Congress does not.
Rep. Sam Gibbons, D—Fla., a leader of

the opponents' drive Wednesday said he
also hopes Nixon will reject the bill.
House Republican leader Gerald R.
Ford, pressed by Democrats on whether
Nixon would veto the bill, said Nixon
would make that decision only after he
saw what Congress passed.
State Department Opposition
Although the President has taken no
public stand on the House bill since last
summer when he said he favored only
textile relief, the State Department is on
record against the bill while the
Commerce Department has tended to
support it without publicly doing so.
The textile and shoe quotas —which
would be the first imposed by Congress
since 1 930— would cut imports from
abroad of those items next year to
1967-69 levels. A 5 per cent increase in
the imports would be permitted each year
after that until 1 976 when the quotas
would expire.

The Daily regrets any implication in
yesterday's article on the paper's
financial problems that business
manager George Gugelmann had
resigned when he anticipated a debt
for this year's publication.
