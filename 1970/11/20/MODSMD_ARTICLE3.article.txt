BULLETlN—Attempts by Cal students and an overzealous group of
Stanford's own to light the bonfire a night early were thwarted by
LSJUMB patrolmen and bonfire guards.
Four other Cal students were stopped by bandsmen on Campus Drive
after their car was observed acting suspiciously. A number of Stanford
road signs were found in the back seat of the vehicle which was escorted
by police to the station. It is not known if any charges were pressed.
A large number of Arroyo residents with torches were stopped just
short of the bonfire by a band jeep and other guards after they made a
wild charge across the lakebed.
Numerous other Cal vehicles, many with masking tape over their
parking stickers, were stopped and escorted off campus as the pre-Big
Game watch continued.
