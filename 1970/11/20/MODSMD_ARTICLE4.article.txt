# Student Retires After Week's Stint As FBI Informer On RU Activities
## 
### RON GOLDSTEIN 
The byline on this story is the
pseudonym given to me by the FBI for
use when I reported information to
them about the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union (RU).
My adventure as a junior G-man for
the last week was marked throughout
by an air of incompetence and naivete.
I had been approached the week
before by members of the RU, who
wished to discuss the possibility of my
joining their group. At that time I did
not want to join the RU, but I felt that
I might be able to get some interesting
information by approaching the FBI.

After several false starts, I contacted
the FBI. I told them I was an average
Stanford student who had been
approached by the RU, and that while I
realized that I could just tell the RU to
get lost, I thought that maybe the FBI
would be interested in any information
I could obtain. The agent said that they
might indeed be interested, and we
made an appointment for 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
Plain Office
The local FBI office is room 318 in
the Bank of America building at 2600
El Camino. The office features a
number of stark desks and, on one wall,
the "Ten Most Wanted" posters.
I was greeted at the door by Agent
Duncan, who showed me into a small
room off the main office. The room
contained a camera tripod, a
dictaphone, several filing cabinets, and
a desk.
"Glad to meet you Phil, we'd like to
find out a little about you before we
see if you can help us," Duncan began.
He asked some general questions
about my political philosophy, leading
up to his inquiring what had prompted
the RU to recruit me, and why I had
come to the FBI. I explained that I had
taken a class from H. Bruce Franklin
last year, and perhaps RU people had
thought that my participation in the
class indicated that I might want to join
the RU. Franklin is a prominent
member of the RU.
Duncan looked a little skeptical. He
leaned back in his swivel chair, and said
suddenly, "Do you still write for the
Daily?"
Associations
I answered that 1 had written for the
Daily, but now mainly do layout of the
editorial pagfs. This seemed to satisfy
Duncan, who then placed a brown
paper file on the table, and removed a
Xerox copy of a Daily article from last
spring, which mentioned that I, along
with Leonard Siegel, had reported
being sprayed with an irritating
substance during an Off-ROTC
demonstration last spring.
"Is it true that you know Leonard
Siegel, and participated in this
demonstration?" he asked.
I pointed out that simply because
both of our names were mentioned in
the same paragraph, it did not mean
that Lenny and I participated in the
demonstration together, oi that I even
knew him. Again DiU:e;m's suspicions
appeared to be allayed. (He left the file,
closed, on the table. There seemed to
be several more papers inside.)
The agent commented that perhaps

one of the reasons that the RU had
approached me was my position on the
Daily, and that they hoped to gain
control of the opinion pages by
recruiting me. I said that this could be
true, but I really didn't know.
Academic Freedom
Throughout the course of our
conversation, Duncan repeatedly
assured me that the FBI appreciated
my voluntary offer of service, and that
the Bureau did not wish to infringe on
anyone's academic freedom during the
investigation. After he used the phrase
academic freedom five or six times, I
asked exactly what that meant as far as
the FBI was concerned.

Narrative

"We don't want to prevent anyone
from being able to speak freely. That is
one of our great freedoms, and we
think it should be preserved. But when
groups go beyond speaking, to
advocating picking up the gun, that's
where we have to draw the line, and
regard them as a danger. It is fine for
people at an academic institution to
explain theories, such as Communism,
but when they advocate picking up the
gun, that's something else," he replied.
He then asked if I regarded the RU
as a group which advocates "picking up
the gun" against the government. I said
that I thought it probably was such a
group. He immediately wrote this
down, as he had all of my previous
statements.
Duncan asked exactly what contacts
I had had with the RU and I explained
that thus far I had talked to one
member, and that we had discussed the
politics of the RU. After noting the
name of the RU member, Duncan
explained that the FBI wanted to know
a little more about me.
Personal Information
He asked me several rhetorical
questions, perhaps to indicate that the
FBI knew a great deal about me
already.
"Do you still live in trailer 1 5 Z? Is
your home address still 744 7 Euclid
Parkway in Chicago? Are your
rommates still and ? He named
one of my roommates incorrectly, just
as it is listed incorrectly in the Stanford
directory.

He then examined me extensively on
personal information, asking for my
Social Security number, draft number,
driver's license number, parents' names,
my height, weight, date of birth, color
of eyes, and if I had ever been arrested.
After 1 replied to all of those
questions, Duncan took a paper from
my file on which was a prepared,
handwritten, statement which he asked
me to read and sign. "We want you to
sign this so that you know that the FBI
is not interested in infringing o
anyone's freedoms," Duncan explaineo
Meaningless Statement
The statement said that 1 voluntarily
came to the FBI to give them
information because I am opposed to
the overthrow of the government by
force, and am interested in helping the
FBI oppose any group which advocates
this. I signed the statement after
mentally assuring myself that it was so
vaguely worded as to be meaningless.
Duncan slipped it back into the file.
He asked me what information 1
thought I would be able to furnish. I
said that at the beginning 1 could
probably do little more than go to RU
collective meetings and report who was
there. He asked me if I knew anyone,
other than the contact who 1 had
named who I believed was in the RU. I
mentioned several names, all well
known Stanford RU members.
I then asked Duncan what
information the FBI would like me to
He said that the FBI is
interested in the activities of groups
which advocate the violent overthrow
of the government, and that any
information would be helpful. I
thought this was a glaring evasion of
my question, but I didn't press him.
After several more minutes of
general discussion, Duncan suggested
that I wait for the RU to contact me
again, and call him at the Palo Alto FBI
office if they did. He said, "For your
own safety, we would like you to use
the name Ron Goldstein when calling
here. Ask for Duncan, but say t hat Ron
is calling, and I'll know who you are. n
I have occasion to call you, I will say
that I am Harry Baker."
He then got up, ushered me to the
door, and thanked me for volunteering
my information.
Having acquired my first secret
identity, I left the office.
Wednesday afternoon 1 spoke to H
Bruce Franklin, telling him what had
happened at the FBI office the day
before. 1 asked r ;anklin what
information 1 could safely give the FBI

located in this Bank of America office building on El Camino Real.
without jeopardizing any members of the
RU. Franklin said he would think about
it, but suggested that 1 not go very deeply
into the RU, because "it might be
embarassing later. Unless you really want
to join the RU, 1 would not advise
carrying this on further."
Franklin did suggest that a good way
to finish the matter would be to call the
FBI and claim that Bruce Franklin had
approached me, saying that he knew all
the details of my meeting with Duncan,
and that I would be better off dropping
the matter quickly.
Feeling slightly yippieeish, 1 called
Duncan and told him this. After a long
pause, Duncan muttered,
"strange .. . very strange. Did he
(Franklin) indicate how he found this
out?" I replied that Franklin did not tell
me where he had gotten the information,
but that I was scared, and wanted to get
out of the situation as soon as possible.
Duncan said that 1 should do nothing for

a week, that he would check some things
out, and that I should call him back next
week.

FBI oppose any group which advocates
this. I signed the statement after
mentally assuring myself that it was so
vaguely worded as to be meaningless.
Duncan slipped it back into the file.
He asked me what information 1
thought I would be able to furnish. I
said that at the beginning 1 could
probably do little more than go to RU
collective meetings and report who was
there. He asked me if I knew anyone,
other than the contact who 1 had
named who I believed was in the RU. I
mentioned several names, all well
known Stanford RU members.
I then asked Duncan what
information the FBI would like me to
He said that the FBI is
interested in the activities of groups
which advocate the violent overthrow
of the government, and that any
information would be helpful. I
thought this was a glaring evasion of
my question, but I didn't press him.
After several more minutes of
general discussion, Duncan suggested
that I wait for the RU to contact me
again, and call him at the Palo Alto FBI
office if they did. He said, "For your
own safety, we would like you to use
the name Ron Goldstein when calling
here. Ask for Duncan, but say t hat Ron
is calling, and I'll know who you are. n
I have occasion to call you, I will say
that I am Harry Baker."
He then got up, ushered me to the
door, and thanked me for volunteering
my information.
Having acquired my first secret
identity, I left the office.
Wednesday afternoon 1 spoke to H
Bruce Franklin, telling him what had
happened at the FBI office the day
before. 1 asked r ;anklin what
information 1 could safely give the FBI

without jeopardizing any members of the
RU. Franklin said he would think about
it, but suggested that 1 not go very deeply
into the RU, because "it might be
embarassing later. Unless you really want
to join the RU, 1 would not advise
carrying this on further."
Franklin did suggest that a good way
to finish the matter would be to call the
FBI and claim that Bruce Franklin had
approached me, saying that he knew all
the details of my meeting with Duncan,
and that I would be better off dropping
the matter quickly.
Feeling slightly yippieeish, 1 called
Duncan and told him this. After a long
pause, Duncan muttered,
"strange .. . very strange. Did he
(Franklin) indicate how he found this
out?" I replied that Franklin did not tell
me where he had gotten the information,
but that I was scared, and wanted to get
out of the situation as soon as possible.
Duncan said that 1 should do nothing for

a week, that he would check some things
out, and that I should call him back next
week.

The byline on this story is the
pseudonym given to me by the FBI for

them about the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union (RU).
My adventure as a junior G-man for
the last week was marked throughout
by an air of incompetence and naivete.
I had been approached the week
before by members of the RU, who
wished to discuss the possibility of my
joining their group. At that time I did
not want to join the RU, but I felt that
I might be able to get some interesting
information by approaching the FBI.

After several false starts, I contacted
the FBI. I told them I was an average
Stanford student who had been
approached by the RU, and that while I
realized that I could just tell the RU to
get lost, I thought that maybe the FBI
would be interested in any information
I could obtain. The agent said that they
might indeed be interested, and we
made an appointment for 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
Plain Office
The local FBI office is room 318 in
the Bank of America building at 2600
El Camino. The office features a
number of stark desks and, on one wall,
the "Ten Most Wanted" posters.
I was greeted at the door by Agent
Duncan, who showed me into a small
room off the main office. The room
contained a camera tripod, a
dictaphone, several filing cabinets, and
a desk.
"Glad to meet you Phil, we'd like to
find out a little about you before we
see if you can help us," Duncan began.
He asked some general questions
about my political philosophy, leading
up to his inquiring what had prompted
the RU to recruit me, and why I had
come to the FBI. I explained that I had
taken a class from H. Bruce Franklin
last year, and perhaps RU people had
thought that my participation in the
class indicated that I might want to join
the RU. Franklin is a prominent
member of the RU.
Duncan looked a little skeptical. He
leaned back in his swivel chair, and said
suddenly, "Do you still write for the
Daily?"
Associations
I answered that 1 had written for the
Daily, but now mainly do layout of the
editorial pagfs. This seemed to satisfy
Duncan, who then placed a brown
paper file on the table, and removed a
Xerox copy of a Daily article from last
spring, which mentioned that I, along
with Leonard Siegel, had reported
being sprayed with an irritating
substance during an Off-ROTC
demonstration last spring.
"Is it true that you know Leonard
Siegel, and participated in this
demonstration?" he asked.
I pointed out that simply because
both of our names were mentioned in
the same paragraph, it did not mean
that Lenny and I participated in the
demonstration together, oi that I even
knew him. Again DiU:e;m's suspicions
appeared to be allayed. (He left the file,
closed, on the table. There seemed to
be several more papers inside.)
The agent commented that perhaps

one of the reasons that the RU had
approached me was my position on the
Daily, and that they hoped to gain
control of the opinion pages by
recruiting me. I said that this could be
true, but I really didn't know.
Academic Freedom
Throughout the course of our
conversation, Duncan repeatedly
assured me that the FBI appreciated
my voluntary offer of service, and that
the Bureau did not wish to infringe on
anyone's academic freedom during the
investigation. After he used the phrase
academic freedom five or six times, I
asked exactly what that meant as far as
the FBI was concerned.

Narrative

"We don't want to prevent anyone
from being able to speak freely. That is
one of our great freedoms, and we
think it should be preserved. But when
groups go beyond speaking, to
advocating picking up the gun, that's
where we have to draw the line, and
regard them as a danger. It is fine for
people at an academic institution to
explain theories, such as Communism,
but when they advocate picking up the
gun, that's something else," he replied.
He then asked if I regarded the RU
as a group which advocates "picking up
the gun" against the government. I said
that I thought it probably was such a
group. He immediately wrote this
down, as he had all of my previous
statements.
Duncan asked exactly what contacts
I had had with the RU and I explained
that thus far I had talked to one
member, and that we had discussed the
politics of the RU. After noting the
name of the RU member, Duncan
explained that the FBI wanted to know
a little more about me.
Personal Information
He asked me several rhetorical
questions, perhaps to indicate that the
FBI knew a great deal about me
already.
"Do you still live in trailer 1 5 Z? Is
your home address still 744 7 Euclid
Parkway in Chicago? Are your
rommates still and ? He named
one of my roommates incorrectly, just
as it is listed incorrectly in the Stanford
directory.

He then examined me extensively on
personal information, asking for my
Social Security number, draft number,
driver's license number, parents' names,
my height, weight, date of birth, color
of eyes, and if I had ever been arrested.
After 1 replied to all of those
questions, Duncan took a paper from
my file on which was a prepared,
handwritten, statement which he asked
me to read and sign. "We want you to
sign this so that you know that the FBI
is not interested in infringing o
anyone's freedoms," Duncan explaineo
Meaningless Statement
The statement said that 1 voluntarily
came to the FBI to give them
information because I am opposed to
the overthrow of the government by
force, and am interested in helping the
FBI oppose any group which advocates
this. I signed the statement after
mentally assuring myself that it was so
vaguely worded as to be meaningless.

appeared to be allayed. (He left the file,
closed, on the table. There seemed to
be several more papers inside.)
The agent commented that perhaps

one of the reasons that the RU had
approached me was my position on the
Daily, and that they hoped to gain
control of the opinion pages by
recruiting me. I said that this could be
true, but I really didn't know.
Academic Freedom
Throughout the course of our
conversation, Duncan repeatedly
assured me that the FBI appreciated
my voluntary offer of service, and that
the Bureau did not wish to infringe on
anyone's academic freedom during the
investigation. After he used the phrase
academic freedom five or six times, I
asked exactly what that meant as far as
the FBI was concerned.

Narrative

"We don't want to prevent anyone
from being able to speak freely. That is
one of our great freedoms, and we
think it should be preserved. But when
groups go beyond speaking, to
advocating picking up the gun, that's
where we have to draw the line, and
regard them as a danger. It is fine for
people at an academic institution to
explain theories, such as Communism,
but when they advocate picking up the
gun, that's something else," he replied.
He then asked if I regarded the RU
as a group which advocates "picking up
the gun" against the government. I said
that I thought it probably was such a
group. He immediately wrote this
down, as he had all of my previous
statements.
Duncan asked exactly what contacts
I had had with the RU and I explained
that thus far I had talked to one
member, and that we had discussed the
politics of the RU. After noting the
name of the RU member, Duncan
explained that the FBI wanted to know
a little more about me.
Personal Information
He asked me several rhetorical
questions, perhaps to indicate that the
FBI knew a great deal about me
already.
"Do you still live in trailer 1 5 Z? Is
your home address still 744 7 Euclid
Parkway in Chicago? Are your
rommates still and ? He named
one of my roommates incorrectly, just
as it is listed incorrectly in the Stanford
directory.

He then examined me extensively on
personal information, asking for my
Social Security number, draft number,
driver's license number, parents' names,
my height, weight, date of birth, color
of eyes, and if I had ever been arrested.
After 1 replied to all of those
questions, Duncan took a paper from
my file on which was a prepared,
handwritten, statement which he asked
me to read and sign. "We want you to
sign this so that you know that the FBI
is not interested in infringing o
anyone's freedoms," Duncan explaineo
Meaningless Statement
The statement said that 1 voluntarily
came to the FBI to give them
information because I am opposed to
the overthrow of the government by
force, and am interested in helping the
FBI oppose any group which advocates
this. I signed the statement after
mentally assuring myself that it was so
vaguely worded as to be meaningless.
Duncan slipped it back into the file.
He asked me what information 1
thought I would be able to furnish. I
said that at the beginning 1 could
probably do little more than go to RU
collective meetings and report who was
there. He asked me if I knew anyone,
other than the contact who 1 had
named who I believed was in the RU. I
mentioned several names, all well
known Stanford RU members.
I then asked Duncan what
information the FBI would like me to
He said that the FBI is
interested in the activities of groups
which advocate the violent overthrow
of the government, and that any
information would be helpful. I
thought this was a glaring evasion of
my question, but I didn't press him.
After several more minutes of
general discussion, Duncan suggested
that I wait for the RU to contact me
again, and call him at the Palo Alto FBI
office if they did. He said, "For your
own safety, we would like you to use
the name Ron Goldstein when calling
here. Ask for Duncan, but say t hat Ron
is calling, and I'll know who you are. n
I have occasion to call you, I will say
that I am Harry Baker."
He then got up, ushered me to the
door, and thanked me for volunteering
my information.
Having acquired my first secret
identity, I left the office.
Wednesday afternoon 1 spoke to H
Bruce Franklin, telling him what had
happened at the FBI office the day
before. 1 asked r ;anklin what
information 1 could safely give the FBI

without jeopardizing any members of the
RU. Franklin said he would think about
it, but suggested that 1 not go very deeply
into the RU, because "it might be
embarassing later. Unless you really want
to join the RU, 1 would not advise
carrying this on further."
Franklin did suggest that a good way
to finish the matter would be to call the
FBI and claim that Bruce Franklin had
approached me, saying that he knew all
the details of my meeting with Duncan,
and that I would be better off dropping
the matter quickly.
Feeling slightly yippieeish, 1 called
Duncan and told him this. After a long
pause, Duncan muttered,
"strange .. . very strange. Did he
(Franklin) indicate how he found this
out?" I replied that Franklin did not tell
me where he had gotten the information,
but that I was scared, and wanted to get
out of the situation as soon as possible.
Duncan said that 1 should do nothing for

a week, that he would check some things
out, and that I should call him back next
week.
(In his spare time, Ron Goldstein is
Daily editorial pane editor Phil Revzin.)
The byline on this story is the
pseudonym given to me by the FBI for
use when I reported information to
them about the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union (RU).
My adventure as a junior G-man for
the last week was marked throughout
by an air of incompetence and naivete.
I had been approached the week
before by members of the RU, who
wished to discuss the possibility of my
joining their group. At that time I did
not want to join the RU, but I felt that
I might be able to get some interesting
information by approaching the FBI.

After several false starts, I contacted
the FBI. I told them I was an average
Stanford student who had been
approached by the RU, and that while I
realized that I could just tell the RU to
get lost, I thought that maybe the FBI
would be interested in any information
I could obtain. The agent said that they
might indeed be interested, and we
made an appointment for 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
Plain Office
The local FBI office is room 318 in
the Bank of America building at 2600
El Camino. The office features a
number of stark desks and, on one wall,
the "Ten Most Wanted" posters.
I was greeted at the door by Agent
Duncan, who showed me into a small
room off the main office. The room
contained a camera tripod, a
dictaphone, several filing cabinets, and
a desk.
"Glad to meet you Phil, we'd like to
find out a little about you before we
see if you can help us," Duncan began.
He asked some general questions
about my political philosophy, leading
up to his inquiring what had prompted
the RU to recruit me, and why I had
come to the FBI. I explained that I had
taken a class from H. Bruce Franklin
last year, and perhaps RU people had
thought that my participation in the
class indicated that I might want to join
the RU. Franklin is a prominent
member of the RU.
Duncan looked a little skeptical. He
leaned back in his swivel chair, and said
suddenly, "Do you still write for the
Daily?"
Associations
I answered that 1 had written for the
Daily, but now mainly do layout of the
editorial pagfs. This seemed to satisfy
Duncan, who then placed a brown
paper file on the table, and removed a
Xerox copy of a Daily article from last
spring, which mentioned that I, along
with Leonard Siegel, had reported
being sprayed with an irritating
substance during an Off-ROTC
demonstration last spring.
"Is it true that you know Leonard
Siegel, and participated in this
demonstration?" he asked.
I pointed out that simply because
both of our names were mentioned in
the same paragraph, it did not mean
that Lenny and I participated in the
demonstration together, oi that I even
knew him. Again DiU:e;m's suspicions
appeared to be allayed. (He left the file,
closed, on the table. There seemed to
be several more papers inside.)
The agent commented that perhaps

one of the reasons that the RU had

out, and that I should call him back next
week.
(In his spare time, Ron Goldstein is
Daily editorial pane editor Phil Revzin.)
The byline on this story is the
pseudonym given to me by the FBI for
use when I reported information to
them about the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union (RU).
My adventure as a junior G-man for
the last week was marked throughout
by an air of incompetence and naivete.
I had been approached the week
before by members of the RU, who
wished to discuss the possibility of my
joining their group. At that time I did
not want to join the RU, but I felt that
I might be able to get some interesting
information by approaching the FBI.

After several false starts, I contacted
the FBI. I told them I was an average
Stanford student who had been
approached by the RU, and that while I
realized that I could just tell the RU to
get lost, I thought that maybe the FBI
would be interested in any information
I could obtain. The agent said that they
might indeed be interested, and we
made an appointment for 3 p.m.
Tuesday.
Plain Office
The local FBI office is room 318 in
the Bank of America building at 2600
El Camino. The office features a
number of stark desks and, on one wall,
the "Ten Most Wanted" posters.
I was greeted at the door by Agent
Duncan, who showed me into a small
room off the main office. The room
contained a camera tripod, a
dictaphone, several filing cabinets, and
a desk.
"Glad to meet you Phil, we'd like to
find out a little about you before we
see if you can help us," Duncan began.
He asked some general questions
about my political philosophy, leading
up to his inquiring what had prompted
the RU to recruit me, and why I had
come to the FBI. I explained that I had
taken a class from H. Bruce Franklin
last year, and perhaps RU people had
thought that my participation in the
class indicated that I might want to join
the RU. Franklin is a prominent
member of the RU.
Duncan looked a little skeptical. He
leaned back in his swivel chair, and said
suddenly, "Do you still write for the
Daily?"
Associations
I answered that 1 had written for the
Daily, but now mainly do layout of the
editorial pagfs. This seemed to satisfy
Duncan, who then placed a brown
paper file on the table, and removed a
Xerox copy of a Daily article from last
spring, which mentioned that I, along
with Leonard Siegel, had reported
being sprayed with an irritating
substance during an Off-ROTC
demonstration last spring.
"Is it true that you know Leonard
Siegel, and participated in this
demonstration?" he asked.
I pointed out that simply because
both of our names were mentioned in
the same paragraph, it did not mean
that Lenny and I participated in the
demonstration together, oi that I even
knew him. Again DiU:e;m's suspicions
appeared to be allayed. (He left the file,
closed, on the table. There seemed to
be several more papers inside.)
The agent commented that perhaps

one of the reasons that the RU had
approached me was my position on the
Daily, and that they hoped to gain
control of the opinion pages by
recruiting me. I said that this could be
true, but I really didn't know.
Academic Freedom
Throughout the course of our
conversation, Duncan repeatedly
assured me that the FBI appreciated
my voluntary offer of service, and that
the Bureau did not wish to infringe on
anyone's academic freedom during the
investigation. After he used the phrase
academic freedom five or six times, I
asked exactly what that meant as far as
the FBI was concerned.

Narrative

"We don't want to prevent anyone
from being able to speak freely. That is
one of our great freedoms, and we
think it should be preserved. But when
groups go beyond speaking, to
advocating picking up the gun, that's
where we have to draw the line, and
regard them as a danger. It is fine for
people at an academic institution to
explain theories, such as Communism,
but when they advocate picking up the
gun, that's something else," he replied.
He then asked if I regarded the RU
as a group which advocates "picking up
the gun" against the government. I said
that I thought it probably was such a
group. He immediately wrote this
down, as he had all of my previous
statements.
Duncan asked exactly what contacts
I had had with the RU and I explained
that thus far I had talked to one
member, and that we had discussed the
politics of the RU. After noting the
name of the RU member, Duncan
explained that the FBI wanted to know
a little more about me.
Personal Information
He asked me several rhetorical
questions, perhaps to indicate that the
FBI knew a great deal about me
already.
"Do you still live in trailer 1 5 Z? Is
your home address still 744 7 Euclid
Parkway in Chicago? Are your
rommates still and ? He named
one of my roommates incorrectly, just
as it is listed incorrectly in the Stanford
directory.

He then examined me extensively on
personal information, asking for my
Social Security number, draft number,
driver's license number, parents' names,
my height, weight, date of birth, color
of eyes, and if I had ever been arrested.
After 1 replied to all of those
questions, Duncan took a paper from
my file on which was a prepared,
handwritten, statement which he asked
me to read and sign. "We want you to
sign this so that you know that the FBI
is not interested in infringing o
anyone's freedoms," Duncan explaineo
Meaningless Statement
The statement said that 1 voluntarily
came to the FBI to give them
information because I am opposed to
the overthrow of the government by
force, and am interested in helping the
FBI oppose any group which advocates
this. I signed the statement after
mentally assuring myself that it was so
vaguely worded as to be meaningless.
Duncan slipped it back into the file.
He asked me what information 1
thought I would be able to furnish. I
said that at the beginning 1 could
probably do little more than go to RU
collective meetings and report who was
there. He asked me if I knew anyone,
other than the contact who 1 had
named who I believed was in the RU. I
mentioned several names, all well
known Stanford RU members.
I then asked Duncan what
information the FBI would like me to
He said that the FBI is
interested in the activities of groups
which advocate the violent overthrow
of the government, and that any
information would be helpful. I
thought this was a glaring evasion of
my question, but I didn't press him.
After several more minutes of
general discussion, Duncan suggested
that I wait for the RU to contact me
again, and call him at the Palo Alto FBI
office if they did. He said, "For your
own safety, we would like you to use
the name Ron Goldstein when calling
here. Ask for Duncan, but say t hat Ron
is calling, and I'll know who you are. n
I have occasion to call you, I will say
that I am Harry Baker."
He then got up, ushered me to the
door, and thanked me for volunteering
my information.
Having acquired my first secret
identity, I left the office.
Wednesday afternoon 1 spoke to H
Bruce Franklin, telling him what had
happened at the FBI office the day
before. 1 asked r ;anklin what
information 1 could safely give the FBI

without jeopardizing any members of the
RU. Franklin said he would think about
it, but suggested that 1 not go very deeply
into the RU, because "it might be
embarassing later. Unless you really want
to join the RU, 1 would not advise
carrying this on further."
Franklin did suggest that a good way
to finish the matter would be to call the
FBI and claim that Bruce Franklin had
approached me, saying that he knew all
the details of my meeting with Duncan,
and that I would be better off dropping
the matter quickly.
Feeling slightly yippieeish, 1 called
Duncan and told him this. After a long
pause, Duncan muttered,
"strange .. . very strange. Did he
(Franklin) indicate how he found this
out?" I replied that Franklin did not tell
me where he had gotten the information,
but that I was scared, and wanted to get
out of the situation as soon as possible.
Duncan said that 1 should do nothing for

a week, that he would check some things
out, and that I should call him back next
week.
