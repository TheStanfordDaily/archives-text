# Football Game Slated With Upstate Team
## Klassic Kapers Kontinue 
### APHLINGOE T. MCNAUGHT 
A battle between three forces each
claiming to be the true representatives
of the People-promises to enliven an
otherwise dull afternoon of football
tomorrow.
Although the papers have already
given great publicity to Jock Lib, other
relatively unpublicized forces plan to
contest the coalition's claims to
popular supremacy.
The Daily Californian reported on
Tuesday, "the people (that's us) will
engage in water warfare with the mass
of demagogic avaricious ruling-class
buffons who are known as the leland
Stanford JUNIOR university rooting
section." (Sic.)
Water warfare will take the
traditional Bakeleyian form of shooting
water ballons at the Stanford rooters,
an art form which in recent years has
reached a low state at the East Bay
campus.
1966 saw the Berkeley pranksters
showering the Stanford rooters with
water ballons in the midst of a
drenching downpour. The next two
years the clever chaps' aim failed
miserably doing nothing but slightly
dampening the tracks around the fields.
The Berkeley administration has
reportedly threatened to exercise no
controls over the ballooners if the
Stanford band flauntingly displays a
Cal band uniform liberated several
vears back.

Jock Lib is demanding Big Game be
free and is asking its followers to crash
the gates. It has also demanded an end
to drug abuse in athletics, free
admission to all Stanford-Cal sports
events, community control of athletic
departments, and an end to
dehumanizing violence in sports.
Stanford's contributions to free
games will consist at least of tonight's
bonfire at 7 :30 on Lake Lag, and the
annual band march through the City
starting at 9 :00 p.m. at the Fairmount.
Of course the essence of Big Game
spirit is embodied in the Axe, a plaque
awarded annually to the school winning
the football game. Seven out of the
past nine years the Axe has resided at
Stanford: one year Berkeley won the
Big Garnet another year, some Cal fans
borrowed it from its fortified case in
Tresidder. Bandsmen and Daily staffers
repulsed another attack on the Axe
Sunday evening.
Other classic Big Game pranks
( include stealing the Axe back from Cal
on April 3, 1930 by the Immortal 21,
kidnapping the Cal pom pon dollies,
and stealing a gigantic University of
California banner from a cafeteria
there.
But the magnitude of the pranks
have increased just a bit this year.
According to an unidentified informed


Daily ohoto by Bill Cooke
OH SWEET YESTERYEAR- But barring a stupendous Cal rip-off, (his y<;..r's
bonfire has every hope of resembling 1968 s. Of course, the hair may be a little
longer.
