BERKELEY—"Tactics for the
liberation of the Big Game" were
outlined in a tape recorded speech at a
press conference called yesterday
morning by the People's Athletic
Committee (PAC).
The anonymous tape recording
stated, "The People's Athletic
Liberation Movement calls for the
Revolutionary People to assemble in
Sproul Plaza at noon Saturday to hear a
communique to implement point,
one—free admission to the game and to
insure that the Big Game does not take
place as usual."
After saying that the players, band
members, and cheerleaders are
"brothers and sisters," the mystery
voice continued, "Of course we know
that the pigs are the enemy of the
people and must be attacked if they
attempt to prevent the liberation
effort.
"The revolutionary community is
taking this action as an act of love in
direct opposition to pig Amerika's
death culture as epitomized by
gladitorial football clashes," the
recorder voice said.
Speakers at the meeting gave further
indications of the radicals' plans f)r
Saturday morning.
Peoples' Tactics
". . . Asa result of the
of the Cal and Stanford athletic
departments in negotiations, we cannot
<•< ndemn the use of peoples' tactics this
Saturday,'" remarked one member of
the PAC.

Another claimed that "at least 5 ,000
people will be at the Sproul Plaza rally
and will be prepared to liberate the
game." He added, "Some even want to
burn down the stadium and we've had
trouble controlling them."
Despite the threat of a
confrontation and possible violence, a
police spokesman claimed that no
special security arrangements have been
planned.
Lt. Robert Ludden said that 5 0
University of California policemen have
been assigned to the game, a normal
number for a crowd of 75,000. In
addition to the 50 campus policemen,
Ludden said there will be 25 Alameda
County Sheriff Deputies on duty and
about 75 Berkeley policemen who will
be doing traffic work, but who could
be used in the event of an emergency.
Ludden claimed that the o f fers will
be in regular uniforms and will not be
riot equipped. He also denied that there
will be any tactical or riot squads on
call during the game.
"We're not scared, of these people,"
he said. "We've run up against them
before and we feel that we will be able
to control any trouble with our usual
complement of officers."
Claim Discounted
Ludden also discounted the People's
Ahtletic Committee's claim of 5,000
expected supporters. "If they had that
many people, they wouldn't need to
call for the rally."
