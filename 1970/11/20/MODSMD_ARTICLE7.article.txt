## FBI Files And Political Naivete 
### 
The FBI informant story (see page 1) tells much about
the widening search efforts of the government and its desire
to compile facts on everyone who seems remotely connected
with protest movements. Most of all it should show us a
little of our own naivete in never facing up to this sordid and
intimidating situation.
The file on the Daily reporter illustrates the extent of the
FBl's work since the informant hardly considers himself a
radical. He writes occasionally for the paper and does not
specialize in political reporting. He currently takes a course
from Professor Bruce Franklin, but he does not spend his
days and nights poring over Lin Piao or class contradictions.
"Ron Goldstein" participated in the student strike last
spring along with several thousand other students. He carries
no gun, he plants no bombs, and he rarely talks of hijacking
planes. One of his roommates is a political heavy-a writer for
the Arena and a member of the Free Campus Movement.
The whole affair might be comic with the bumbling
gullibility and eager attentiveness of the FBI agent if it were
not so real. In short though, it seems the Daily's double
agent is no different than many, many young people in
college who object to the way this country is run. The
government judges him noteworthy because he wanders on
the fringes of the radical movement and often sees fit to
attend anti-war rallies.
The FBI watches him through its surprisingly thorough
and up-to-date files. Obviously the Bureau chieftans do not
spend their lives chasing after him and others like him, and
so perhaps much of the instant paranoia is unwarranted. But
their scrutiny amounts to an uncomfortably close watch.
The files themselves are an unknown factor; no one but
their keepers know anything of them. The Army apparently
keeps a large data center in Maryland stocked wi.th the latest

speech by Jane Fonda and other information on people who
they sense are suspicious. It employs a thousand
"intelligence" experts to collect the data.
Against the national background of the Army and the
FBI lie the surveillance efforts of the local police. Palo Alto
has its own experts on the "Red Squad," a group originally
set up to handle sensitive crime problems such as drugs and
gambling and now devoted to keeping track of area radicals.
Even closer to home, Stanford police supposedly destroyed
their own files on radicals last year after an embarrassing
episode in which they tried to infiltrate a radical group.
All these files are troubling, for in most peoples' minds
they amount to a tacit accusation. None of those listed can
see or gain any knowledge of what the government says of
them. The agencies no doubt exchange information about
those on file and probably make an effort to keep abreast of
the latest developments. The statistics which the agent asked
the Daily reporter suggest the applicability of an efficient
computer to help the FBI keep tabs on the scene.
This display of overkill is appallingly stupid. Yet it is also
frightening since the files must be viewed as an effort,
however indirect, to intimidate and quiet protest. The
existence of files can mean little else: they are for use in
tracking political enemies and in building up court cases
against them.
To react to the reporter's story with amazement or
surprise appears naive in a very unsettling way. Many are
startled to learn the government keeps files on left-liberals or
that FBI agents mouth platitudes on freedom of speech
while taking notes on political beliefs. People must begin to
look beyond just isolated incidents.
Pieces of a picture are strewn all around, and still we
never place them together until we ourselves are a piece.
