# 'Daily' Stuff Prepares For Ink Bowl
## 
### JESSE CEDARBAUM 
1970 seems to be the year in which old jinxes and bugaboos are
going the way of the good $5 lid, especially as far as Stanford and
football are concerned.
And hopefully one more hex will vanish down the vortex Saturday
morning in Berkeley as the jousting journalists of the Daily truck onto

enemy turf to tackle the wanton woolies of the Daily Cal staff in that
annual pre-post-season classic, the Ink Bowl.
The origins of the Ink Bowl lie buried deep in the days of clay
tablets, crew cuts and white sox. But we do know that traditionally,
with only one or two exceptions in recent memory, the mentor of the
winning team goes on to lose the Big Game.
No one knows the exact tally of wins and losses in the liquid
classic, but the last time the Stanford scribes emerged with victory
grins etched on their smug faces, the varsity blew it. That was 196 7, in
the days B.P.
Last year's Ink Bowl ended in a 6-6 deadline in a vicious,
mud-slinging contest.
The lone Daily touchdown came on a perfectly executed halfback
option play, with sports scribe Hull Daily winging the ball in from the
two to photog Bill Hudson. In the ensuing conversion attempt, ace
sportswriter Fred Mann suffered a slight concussion trying to make a
leaping catch. Poor Fred hasn't covered a football game since, but he
no longer thinks he's Randy Vataha, either.
This year Fred and the rest of the witless writers are out for
revenge, with what Coach Fred Leeson feels is a "much improved
team," despite a gaping hole in our line left by the departure of
Sulphurbottom Schwartz.
"We're really up for this one," added his assistant, Don Tollefson.
"Our game plan is far superior to theirs." Rumor has it that the Cal
layout was censored by the Regents.
Calling the numbers for Stanford will be Hall Daily, dubbed
"T.H.C." by his teammates. Daily attributes both his nickname and
his starting berth to last year's easy touchdown pass. "It was just a
stone's throw away," he explained.
Summing up the Daily's attitude toward Saturday's opponent,
Hunchback Jonathan Dedmon wryly observed, "It sould be a bear,
but I think we can handle it." Write on.
