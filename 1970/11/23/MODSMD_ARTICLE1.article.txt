# US Warplanes Sweep Indochina; Laird Claims Bombing Retaliatory
## 
### PHIL LIND 
Striking from three aircraft carriers
in the Gulf of Tonkin and air bases in
Thailand and South Vietnam, as many
as 400 warplanes swept across a wide
area of Indochina including North
Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia in a
double wave of attacks last Friday and
Saturday.
According to Pentagon spokesmen,
the major reason for the new raids was
the shooting down of a U.S. RF4
reconaissance jet over North Vietnam
on Nov. 13.

Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird
said, "I want to state that we will
continue to take protective reaction as
necessary to protect the pilots of our
unarmed reconaissance planes."
One Pentagon official, who refused
to use his name, was reported in the
New York Times as saying, "Heavy
rains and B-5 2 strikes along the Ho Chi
Minh Trail system in Laos have
prevented the North Vietnamese from
moving much of these supplies south.
They have been piling up for weeks. If
this strike is successful, and I have
every confidence it will be, it will
present quite a setback to the enemy."
Tacit Agreement
Laird indicated that with the
November 1 968 bombing halt there
was a tacit agreement with the North
Vietnamese that reconaissance planes
would not be attacked. However, a
story in yesterday's San Francisco
Examiner said that CBS correspondent
Robert Pierpont had learned from an
unnamed former member of the
Johnson Administration that such an
agreement had never been reached.
The political sensitivity of the raids
was underscored by the U.S.
Command's refusal to comment on two

of their major aspects. First, North
Vietnam reported that five U.S.
fighter-bombers and one helicopter
were shot down. There has been no
direct denial of this by spokesmen in
Saigon. Second, Hanoi reported that a
number of "old persons and children"
were killed during the attacks.
U.S. spokesmen indicated that the
19 th parallel was supposed to have
been the limit of the bombings of the
North which would have placed the
bombings well below the Hanoi region.
However, reports from Hanoi indicated
that the bombings reached far above
the 19 th parallel and that a
prisoner-of-war camp north of Hanoi
was struck, causing casualities among
the Americans held there.
Laird Denial
Laird denied these reports but
refused to explain how the U.S. was
certain of this.
According to the Examiner
informed sources said there had been "
more than 60 protective reaction
strikes flown against the North since
the 1968 bombing halt. The U.S.
Command has acknowledged only a
fraction of those, usually when a plane
was lost."

The attack was not limited to North
Vietnam however, as about 200 planes
raided supply depots across the border
in Laos.
North's Reaction
North Vietnam's foreign minister
said in a broadcast over Hanoi's official
news agency that the bombings posed
"a grave threat to the work of the Paris
conference on Vietnam. U.S. warplanes
repeatedly attacked many populated
areas, communication lines and
economic establishments in Quang Bing
and HaTinh provinces."
Defense Secretary Melvin Laird said
of the bombings that they were of
"limited duration and protective
reaction air strikes against missile and
anti-aircraft gun sites and related
facilities in North Vietnam, south of
the 19th parallel."
However, two professors here, John
W. Lewis and Lyman Van Slyke, as well
as Banning Garrett, a writer for
Ramparts Magazine challenged Laird's
statement in interviews with the Daily
last night.
According to China expert Lewis,
the bombings are certainly not a new
