# Ink Classic Tradition Fails
## 
### 
With gallant Daily staffers just
15 tards from paydirt, the clock
ran out Saturday to end a
comeback bid for an upset in the
annual Ink Bowl Touch Football
Classic. Hall Dailey's desperation
pass fell incomplete in the
endzone as the journalists clung to
a fragile but, alas, final 22-18 lead.
In the past seven years, the
school fielding the big loser in the
Ink Bowl has gone on to take
home the Axe in the other game
played on the next to last
Saturday in November. For all the
good it did, the Tribe Scribes
might just as well have won.
That's not to say they didn't
play their hearts out, but the long
road trip had its telling effects. So
did the Cal rules.
Early in the first half as Daily
dropped back to punt, the Scribe
linemen doggedly held their

positions awaiting the thud of
shoe on ball as per Section Four,
Article Six of the Stanford IM
Official Rulebook. Doggedly they
held their ground as the hordes of
blue and yellow journalists blew
by to block the kick. A somewhat
heated discussion ensued but the
spirit of fair play prevailed and
Cal took over first and goal at the
ten.
The Berkeleyites had fourteen
points on the board before the
Tribe Scribes could get it
together, and the Indians were
forced to depart from their game
plan and play comeback ball.
HTC (Hall The Clutch) Daily
went right to work and hit Nick
Corff with an over the shoulder
touchdown pass in the left corner
of the endzone.
Berkeley scored again, but the
second half was all Stanford's.
Ed Kohn, Jesse Cedarbaum,
Lang Atwood and Chris Peck
blanketed the Bear receivers, and
a fierce pass rush by on "Last
Laugh" Dedmon and Don
"Terrible Tolly" Tollefson forced
several turnovers including a pass
interception by Cliff Nancarrow.
Taking advantage of the
breaks, Daily picked up good
yardage on passes to fleetfooted

Bill Freivogel and returning
veteran, Fred Mann, before
throwing to Mann for the final
two TD'sof the morning.
Unable to score any
conversions, Daily was again
looking for his favorite receiver
for the go-ahead touchdown when
the gun sounded.
