Cambodian Highway Cut
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Hard fighting erupted on
Cambodia's key highway to the sea yesterday after an
enemy ambush drove Cambodian troops out of the
Elephant range of mountains.
The Cambodian high command announced that a
government cartridge workshop at Stung Chral, Cambodia's
only arms factory, was the scene of a major assault Sunday
afternoon and that fighting continued despite bombing and
strafing by planes.
Stung Chral's Czech built factory manufactures
cartridges for obsolete French World War II single shot
rifles. It is located on Highway 4, 6 0 miles southwest of
Phnom Penh.
A few hours earlier an enemy ambush at Pech Nil Gap, a
mountain pass leading into the Elephant range, drove a
Cambodian battalion from the hills. Former head of state
Prince Norodom Sihanouk had a villa close to the pass,
which leads to the ammunition factory at a point where the
highway leaves flat country.
Brig. Gen. Sosthene Fernandez, commander of the
military region through which Highway 4 passes to the sea,
reported by telephone from his headquarters at Kompong
Speu that his troops had been able to regroup and link up
with a second Cambodian battalion about two miles from
the pass. Gen. Fernandez said the ambushed troops claimed
they had been attacked by troops which included North
Koreans.
Prison Farm Flare-Up
CUMMINS PRISON FARM, Ark. - About 55 armed state
troopers remained at Cummins Prison Farm yesterday in
the wake of two days of fighting that stemmed from
demands for separate quarters for black and white inmates.
Correction Commissioner Robert Sarver said the
troopers were aiding in separating the militant,
"recalcitrant" inmates from the rest of the inmate
population.
He said these inmates, numbering about 100, would be
made to pick cotton at the prison all day yesterday before
being housed in separate barracks.
Sarver said there was a minor scuffle in the dining room
yesterday morning that was quelled by state police. A
police spokesman also said about six inmates in the prison's
isolation unit tried to cut their way out of the unit at about
2 a.m., but were stopped by troopers.
There are 1,160 inmates in the prison. Sarver said that

about 500 inmates participated in the fighting at one time
or another. He said 10 of the most militant inmates were
transferred two days ago to Tucker Prison Farm
indefinitely.
State police were called Saturday night when Sarver said
conditions at Cummins had reached riot proportions.
Cross Letter Discovered
MONTREAL — A letter apparently from kidnaped British
Diplomat James R. Cross saying he is alive and well has
been found with a note from the terrorist Quebec
Liberation Front asking United Nations Secretary-General
U Thant to intercede in behalf of "political prisoners."
Police said yesterday they were checking the
authenticity of the documents. If the letter really is from
Cross it would be the first communication from him in
more than a month.
Cross was kidnaped Oct. 5, Quebec Labor Minister
Pierre Laporte was abducted Oct. 10 and murdered a week
later. Separate cells of the front, known by its French
initials FLQ, claimed responsibility for the kidnapings.
The note asked Thant to intervene to speed the release
of 24 " political prisoners" persons serving terms or
awaiting trial for terrorist acts in exchange for Cross.
The note and letter were found two days ago in response
to anonymous telephone calls. The letter was dated Nov.
15 and the note Nov. 21.
The letter, signed "J.R. Cross" and addressed "to whom
it may concern," said "I want to assure those who are
interested .. . that 1 am in good health and being well
treated."
Physicist Claims Credit
MOSCOW — A Soviet physicist has charged that American
scientists have taken credit for producing a new artificial
element after his institute already produced it.
Academician Georgi Flerov, chief of the nuclear
reactions laboratory at Dubna Research Center near
Moscow, said Dubna publisbc-d early this year the first
reliable information on the new chemical element, called
Hahnium by the Americans.
Flerov made his charge in a letter in the current issue of
the magazine Priroda Nature. He said Dubna sent copies of
its findings to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley. He said Dubna
researchers were deeply convinced of the accuracy of their
findings.

Physicist Claims Credit
MOSCOW — A Soviet physicist has charged that American
scientists have taken credit for producing a new artificial
element after his institute already produced it.
Academician Georgi Flerov, chief of the nuclear
reactions laboratory at Dubna Research Center near
Moscow, said Dubna publisbc-d early this year the first
reliable information on the new chemical element, called
Hahnium by the Americans.
Flerov made his charge in a letter in the current issue of
the magazine Priroda Nature. He said Dubna sent copies of
its findings to the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory at the
University of California at Berkeley. He said Dubna
researchers were deeply convinced of the accuracy of their
findings.
Cambodian Highway Cut
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia Hard fighting erupted on
Cambodia's key highway to the sea yesterday after an
enemy ambush drove Cambodian troops out of the
Elephant range of mountains.
The Cambodian high command announced that a
government cartridge workshop at Stung Chral, Cambodia's
only arms factory, was the scene of a major assault Sunday
afternoon and that fighting continued despite bombing and
strafing by planes.
Stung Chral's Czech built factory manufactures
cartridges for obsolete French World War II single shot
rifles. It is located on Highway 4, 6 0 miles southwest of
Phnom Penh.
A few hours earlier an enemy ambush at Pech Nil Gap, a
mountain pass leading into the Elephant range, drove a
Cambodian battalion from the hills. Former head of state
Prince Norodom Sihanouk had a villa close to the pass,
which leads to the ammunition factory at a point where the
highway leaves flat country.
Brig. Gen. Sosthene Fernandez, commander of the
military region through which Highway 4 passes to the sea,
reported by telephone from his headquarters at Kompong
Speu that his troops had been able to regroup and link up
with a second Cambodian battalion about two miles from
the pass. Gen. Fernandez said the ambushed troops claimed
they had been attacked by troops which included North
Koreans.
Prison Farm Flare-Up
CUMMINS PRISON FARM, Ark. - About 55 armed state
troopers remained at Cummins Prison Farm yesterday in
the wake of two days of fighting that stemmed from
demands for separate quarters for black and white inmates.
Correction Commissioner Robert Sarver said the
troopers were aiding in separating the militant,
"recalcitrant" inmates from the rest of the inmate
population.
He said these inmates, numbering about 100, would be
made to pick cotton at the prison all day yesterday before
being housed in separate barracks.
Sarver said there was a minor scuffle in the dining room
yesterday morning that was quelled by state police. A
police spokesman also said about six inmates in the prison's
isolation unit tried to cut their way out of the unit at about
2 a.m., but were stopped by troopers.
There are 1,160 inmates in the prison. Sarver said that

about 500 inmates participated in the fighting at one time
or another. He said 10 of the most militant inmates were
transferred two days ago to Tucker Prison Farm
indefinitely.
State police were called Saturday night when Sarver said
conditions at Cummins had reached riot proportions.
