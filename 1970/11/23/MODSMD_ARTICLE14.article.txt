ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) —
President Sekou Toure of Guinea said
African and European troops of the
Portuguese army and navy invaded his
Marxist-oriented nation yesterday and
held ground in the capital of Conakry.
Toure appealed to U.N.
Secretary-General U Thant for the
immediate dispatch of U.N. airborne
troops.
In response, the U.N. Security
Council by unanimous vote early today
demanded the withdrawal of all foreign
armed forces in Guinea.
The council resolution also
authorized a special mission to
investigate the situation in the West
African nation, but the council's
African and Asian members rejected
Guinea's request for U.N. troops.
A spokesman for the Portuguese
Foreign Ministry in Lisbon expressed
"surprise" at Tourer's charge and added:
"We were caught by the oddity of this
news in the middle of the weekend and
the only thing I can add now is that we
are still awaiting official texts of
Toure's statement."
Toure's government has given shelter
and open encouragement to rebels
trying to oust the Portuguese from
neighboring Portuguese Guinea. Radio
Conakry quoted captured raiders
yesterday night as saying the invasion
force came from there.
Radio Conakry quoted a prisoner,
described as "one of the principal
leaders of the attack" and identified as
Capt. Ambroise Fernando, as saying the
raiding force had more than 10 heavily
armed warships and its mission was to
seize the Guinea Defense Ministry.
The radio quoted another prisoner
as saying the invasion force numbered
about 35 0 men, including 5 0 Guineans
serving as guides.
A Guinean captured with the
invaders claimed the force set sail
Friday morning in six boats from an
undisclosed place and arrived off the
Guinean coast Saturday night, the radio

said. He was quoted as saying five
Guineans and a sergeant were to have
captured the Defense Ministry, and a
contingent of 35 Portuguese and three
Guineans was assigned to attack the
planes at Conakry airport.
Toure said in a radio statement that
Conakry was under bombardment but

the attack had been contained by
popular resistance. He said the U.N.
troops were needed for the purpose of
"wiping out, with our national army,
the last positions occupied by the
Portuguese mercenaries and to pursue
the aggressors' ships in our territorial
waters."
