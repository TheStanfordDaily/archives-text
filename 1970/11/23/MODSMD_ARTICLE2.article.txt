# Nixon's Aims Fail Here
## Anti-Draft Feelings Strong 
### PAUL BOYD 
Since becoming President, Richard
Nixon has attempted to eliminate the
inequities in the draft system. He has
established a lottery system, has
replaced aging Louis B. Hershey as head
of the Selective Service, and has
pointed to an all-volunteer army as a
long-range goal.
Many observers have seen President
Nixon's effort to reform the draft as
purely a political move: a means for
cooling off the draft as a political issue,
and in effect, crippling a major part of
the anti-war movement.
If indeed, political motives are
behind Mr. Nixon's reforms, reports
from the Bay Area indicate that he
seems to have failed. Phil Katzen, a
draft counselor for the Resistance in
Palo Alto, feels that "the anti-draft
movement is getting stronger all the
time."
Katzen, who counsels between 20
and 30 people a week, says that the
lottery system has made the draft
"highly visible, and much more
political in nature."
Everyone Knows
"With the oldest men called first, it
wasn't visible who was getting drafted.
Now with the lottery, everyone knows
and sees how many people are getting
drafted."
Katzen's views on the strength of
the anti-draft movements are shared by
Mark Edwards, a draft counselor at
Stanford. He sees the Repeal the Draft
movement growing, as "groups across
the country are co-ordinating their
efforts."
Edwards is working with the
National Council to Repeal the Draft,
an organization that wants the
immediate creation of an all-volunteer
army.
He is optimistic about the success of
the movement, seeing the close vote on
the Hatfield Amendment this summer
as proof that Congress wants to end the
draft.

The amendment, which was tacked
onto an Armed Services bill, would
have increased the pay of first-term
soldiers, would have increased
recruiting drives, and would have
established a stand-by draft system if
enlistments were sufficient to meet the
demand.
Bill Avoided Channels
Thirty-five Senators voted for the
amendment, and Edwards thinks that
more "would have gone for it, if it had
gone through the proper channels, in
this case, the committee system."
At present, the two goals: a one-year
extension of the draft at the end of
June, 1971, instead of the two-year
extension asked for by President
Nixon, and Congressional hearings on
the draft system.
Edwards, along with Allan Strain,
senior draft counselor at Stanford, is
teaching a course that is studying the
draft and preparing testimony for the
Congressional hearings. He feels that
when the hearings are held, the
volunteer army will sell itself,
"economically, logically, as well as
morally."
In the Bay Area, the anti-draft
movement has grown considerably in

the last year. Loren Bashom, head of
the Selective Service Lawyers Panel in
San Francisco, says that in the last
three years, there have been
approximately eight thousand
induction refusals.
Complaints Up
In a report submitted by the U.S.
Attorney's Office, the number of
complaints filed by draft boards in
1969 against men who refused
induction was listed as 1 ,8 04 , some 2 00
more than in 1 968.
Bashom says that "the work done
by draft counselors has gone up
tremendously." He says approximately
5 0 per cent of the men who are
inducted in the Oakland area don't
show up, and 10 per cent of those who
do show up, refuse induction.
All of these men associated with the
anti-draft movement agree on one
point: the movement is growing. They
are optimistic about the chances of an
all-volunteer army being created in the
near future, despite cries from the
Defense Department.
It seems that opposition to the draft
has been increased, not diminished,
despite President Nixon's reform
efforts.
