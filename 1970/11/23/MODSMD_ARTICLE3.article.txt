# Eight Men Here Named On List Of Harvard Presidency Candidates
## 
### R. BRUCE LITTERMAN 
The names of eight persons
associated with Stanford were included
in a list released Friday of 69 men
being considered for the Presidency of
Harvard University.
The list, printed in the Harvard
Crimson, was described in the
newspaper as "the official final list
released by the Harvard
Corporation . .. the first
comprehensive compilation of
remaining contenders."
The Stanford names were as follows:
David Abernethy, Professor of Political
Science; Sidney Drell, Deputy Director
of SLAC, James Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies; David
Hamburg, Chairman of the Department
of Psychiatry and chairman of the
faculty's Presidential Search Committee
last summer; Donald Kennedy,
Chairman of the Department of
Biological Sciences; Joshua Lederberg,
Chairman of the Department of
Genetics; Wolfgang Panofsky, Director
of SLAC; and Otis Peace, Trustee and
former history professor.
Stanford, with eight names,
provided the largest representation
other than Harvard itself. Other
universities and the number of

representatives were Berkeley with
four, University of Chicago with four,
New York University with three, and a
total of five persons from other Ivy
League schools.
According to the Crimson, "one
explanation of the predominance of the
West Coast names is the distance and
inaccessability of reliable interviewing
on the qualifications of candidates.
East Coast candidates, particularly in
Ivy schools are better known among
their Harvard collegues and in the
present democratic 'shoot'em down'
consultation are less likely to survive.
Ironically names associated with
Eastern universities are therefore more
likely to be the strongest candidates."
Only two of the eight Stanford
candidates were available for comment.
According to Abernethy, "I don't have
the temperament or administrative
ability. I really don't think that they
would appoint someone at my age
anyway." Abernethy is 33 years old.
Drell when contacted about his
inclusion on the list said, "that's news
to me." Drell, along with Panofsky has
served on the President's Science
Advisory Committee. Kennedy
presently holds several positions on
Harvard committees, and Gibbs was
once recruited for the head of
Afro-American studies at Harvard.

Others of note on the list included
George P. Shultz, Director of the
Bureau of Management, and a former
fellow at the Institute for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences; G.
Alexander Heard, special adviser to
President Nixon on campus unrest and
Chancellor of Vanderbilt University;
Roger Heyns, who resigned last week as
chancellor of Berkeley; and David E.
Bell, executive vice-president of the
Ford Foundation and former head of
the Agency for International
Development.
The complete list follows: David
Abernethy; H. Gardner Ackley; Robert
McCormick Adams, Jr.; Bernard Bailyn;

The names of eight persons
associated with Stanford were included
in a list released Friday of 69 men
being considered for the Presidency of
Harvard University.
The list, printed in the Harvard
Crimson, was described in the
newspaper as "the official final list
released by the Harvard
Corporation . .. the first
comprehensive compilation of
remaining contenders."
The Stanford names were as follows:
David Abernethy, Professor of Political
Science; Sidney Drell, Deputy Director
of SLAC, James Gibbs, Dean of
Undergraduate Studies; David
Hamburg, Chairman of the Department
of Psychiatry and chairman of the
faculty's Presidential Search Committee
last summer; Donald Kennedy,
Chairman of the Department of
Biological Sciences; Joshua Lederberg,
Chairman of the Department of
Genetics; Wolfgang Panofsky, Director
of SLAC; and Otis Peace, Trustee and
former history professor.
Stanford, with eight names,
provided the largest representation
other than Harvard itself. Other
universities and the number of

representatives were Berkeley with
four, University of Chicago with four,
New York University with three, and a
total of five persons from other Ivy
League schools.
According to the Crimson, "one
explanation of the predominance of the
West Coast names is the distance and
inaccessability of reliable interviewing
on the qualifications of candidates.
East Coast candidates, particularly in
Ivy schools are better known among
their Harvard collegues and in the
present democratic 'shoot'em down'
consultation are less likely to survive.
Ironically names associated with
Eastern universities are therefore more
likely to be the strongest candidates."
Only two of the eight Stanford
candidates were available for comment.
According to Abernethy, "I don't have
the temperament or administrative
ability. I really don't think that they
would appoint someone at my age
anyway." Abernethy is 33 years old.
Drell when contacted about his
inclusion on the list said, "that's news
to me." Drell, along with Panofsky has
served on the President's Science
Advisory Committee. Kennedy
presently holds several positions on
Harvard committees, and Gibbs was
once recruited for the head of
Afro-American studies at Harvard.

Others of note on the list included
George P. Shultz, Director of the
Bureau of Management, and a former
fellow at the Institute for Advanced
Study in the Behavioral Sciences; G.
Alexander Heard, special adviser to
President Nixon on campus unrest and
Chancellor of Vanderbilt University;
Roger Heyns, who resigned last week as
chancellor of Berkeley; and David E.
Bell, executive vice-president of the
Ford Foundation and former head of
the Agency for International
Development.
The complete list follows: David
Abernethy; H. Gardner Ackley; Robert
McCormick Adams, Jr.; Bernard Bailyn;
David E. Bell; Ivan Bennett, Jr.; Darek C.
Bok; William B. Cannon; Allen M. Cartter;
Donald Cook; Archibald Cox; Robert D.
