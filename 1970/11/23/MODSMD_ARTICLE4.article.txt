# Band Hits Town, Sees Piece Of City
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Police, a more-than-topless dancer, several dazed alumni, and
over 3000 rooters, revelers, and assorted parade chasers frolicked
in the streets Friday night as the Incomparable Stanford Band
went on its annual pre-game lurch through the City of San
Francisco.
The parade originated in the plush halls of the Fairmont Hotel
and culminated in North Beach, where the band accompanied a
lush dancer who was, to say the least, scantily dressed.
In point of fact, she wore nothing at all save a pair of
gold-spangled spike-heeled shoes. One bandsman later remarked
in disgust, "And me with my foot fetish."
As the police — San Francisco's stalwart guardians of the
public morals — opened a path for the dancer, the expression on
Drum Major Geordie Lawry's face was one of supreme
amazement and mortification. What Lawry said at the exact
moment the girl stepped out of her robe was not recorded for
posterity, but it was probably unprintable anyway.
The North Beach concert — at the "Off Broadway" club came
at the end of a three-hour march through several hotels, to Union
Square, and through Chinatown. The band did not appear at the
infamous "Condor", despite or because of heavy publicity by
promoter Davey Rosenberg.
Rosenberg, you will recall, is the press agent who brought his
topless girls to Stanford so they could meet Jim Plunkett. Last
week, Rosenberg announced that the band had agreed to make an
appearance at his establishment, and released a photograph of
dancer Lola Raquel (44-23-36 ) emblazoned with a "Beat Kal"
sticker on the 4 4 .
"We decided not to show up at the Condor because we felt we
were being used by Rosenberg for his own purposes," explained
Band Manager Ken Peterson.
It is not known whether Rosenberg's dancers survived their
long and fruitless wait in the cold night air.

SHK SHOULD HAVE DANCKD ALL NlGHT—Barely surpassing the performance of
the dollies, a topless-bottomless dancer of the Off-Broadwav nignt club entertains the
band and convincingly displays to wide-eyed spectators that it's what's up front that
counts.
