# A.C.T.'s Modern 'Merchant'
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The American Conservatory
Theater opened its official
1 970-71 season last week at the
Cleary Theater in San Francisco
with an amazing production of
"The Merchant of Venice." This
may not be the definitive
interpretation of the play, but it's
certainly an unusual one. After
all, how many productions have
featured a topless Jessica?
Now that I've got your
attention, let me point out that
when Jessica (played by Deborah
Sussel, lovely girl) rips off her
blouse for a brief flurry of topless
dancing, it is completely in
character, for director Ellis Rabb
has taken Shakespeare's popular
story of a Jewish money-leader's
single-minded search for revenge
and transferred it, dialogue intact,
into what looks like the set for a
Fellini movie. Instead of an
Elizabethan melodrama we now
have a tale of the decadent
upper-middle class in post-war
Italy, a Shakespearean Dolce Vita;
and considering the problems that
are inherent in the play, Mr. Rabb
has done a marvelous job.
What problems are inherent in
the play? Well, audiences no
longer get terribly enthused about
plays which are blatantly
anti-Semitic. You see, there was
this Hitler thing and that took
most of the fun out of the great
comic moment when a court
orders a Jew to either renounce
his faith or die. That was a pretty
good joke to the Elizabethans,
and to many others, but
nowadays it seems to have lost a
bit of it's zing.
Most productions in the last
twenty years or so have skirted
the issue by playing Shylock as a
sympathetic, almost pathetic
character, a victim of blind and
demeaning prejudice. But not Mr.

Rabb. He has tried to finesse the
anti-Semitism problem by making
Shylock such a rotten stinker that
anyone would hate him. It may
not be the best solution, but it
works.
All of the characters in this
play are rotten to some extent.
They are so dissolute you can
almost see them decaying before
your eyes. Antonio, as played by
Marcello Mastroianni, as played
by Ken Ruta, is old, tired, and
sick of it all. His relationship to
David Gilliam's Bassanio is
obviously more than a close
friendship, and he seems hurt, but
resigned, when the young
Bassanio tells him of his love for
Portia.
Portia, as played by Michael
Learned, is probably the most
sympathetic character in the play,
although even she is capable of a
brief flash of racism when her
guard is down; but when she hurts
the feelings of her Negro maid
Nerissa (Ann Weldon) she feels
sorry about it, which in this play
qualifies her for the Brotherhood
Award.
The most important character
in any production of "The
Merchant of Venice" is Shylock,
the Jewish money-lender, and
Peter Donat (who on alternate
nights plays the Pope in "Hadrian
VII"), is porbably the most
bigoted Shylock to appear on an
American stage in a century. His
hate of Christians is matched only
by his love of money. He is so
nasty that he makes it easy for
them to be anti-Semitic, and from
the way his colleague Tubal
(Joseph Bird) behaves, one gets
the impression that the other
Jewish money lenders in Venice
would not be terribly disturbed if
he were to fall into a canal.
While this interpretation of
Shylock seems to work, it has the

disadvantage of making him
one-dimensional. His famous
appeal for understanding, "Hath
not a Jew eyes?," which is of ten
quoted as evidence that
Shakespeare wasn't really
anti-Semitic, has become an
exercise in logic to explain why it
is perfectly reasonable for
Shylock to want to cut out
Antonio's heart.
Another unfortunate effect of
this interpretation, and indeed, of
the whole concept of the
production, is that it changes the
anti-Semitism of Shakespeare,
who had never seen a Jew in his
life and was using it merely as a
dramatic device, into the
anti-Semitism of Twentiety
century Europe. I am not sure if
Mr. Rabb intended Bassanio and

his friends to look like Young
Fascists, but that's what happens.
Shylock is despicable enough in
his own right, but when the Duke
of Venice addresses him as "Jew"
instead of by his name, one
wonders why the Duke's not
wearing an armband.
Ellis Rabb has directed with a
stunning attention to detail. He
has used sets, costumes, music,
and projections, along with an
army of extras, about as well as
anyone could wish.
"The Merchant of Venice" will
be playing in repertory for the
next few months. Student rush
tickets are available just before
curtain, but this one looks like a
real winner, so I would advise
checking on ticket availability
before you go.
