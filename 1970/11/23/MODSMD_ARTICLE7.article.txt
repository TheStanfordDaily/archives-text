# Freaking At Winterland
## 
### TOM SMALL 
Country Joe Mac Donald and
Stephen (Guitar) Miller held forth
at the Winterland this
weekendâ€”have you ever been
there? From inside seeming as big
as the Vanderburg hangar, flooded
with ultraviolet, and thundering
throughout from Fenders, Sunns,
Marshalls, telecasters,
stratocasters, and more, the old
skating rink regularly shelters in
its dirty, smoke-filled chambers an
enormous crowd.
We sit out the six hour concert
in cramped conditions on the hard
bare floor near the stage or in the
hard close chairs farther away; or
many prefer to linger in the
antechambers and halls,
circulating and greeting the city's
many splendored frightening and
frightful people, and everyone is
welcome here.
This is from the germ of Kesey,
who in '66 with his electric
kool-aid (acid punch) inspired
what must have been one helluva
party, and provided Stewart
Brand, Bill Graham, and Roy
Sebum with a format too sensuous
and wild to ever have originated
from the rich musical comedy
theatres or the symphonies or
schools, and too proletariat for
the Broadway ethnic.
The poster art alone is enough
to boggle the minds of most, and
the visuals inside are even more
devastating; the steady growth of
psychedelia in all its forms is the
envy of the recessed uptown, and
the smaller clubs also prosperous.
Go to the Winterland! Take
$350 each for the long line at the
door if you don't buy the ticket
in advance at Discount Records
(Menlo Park): the first Van Ness
exit from 101 leads by a right and
left through a tricky intersection
to Van Ness, then a left after the
red Fosters' sign puts you on
Geary, where the Winterland will
flash on your right before the big
Sears warehouse. It's too loud to
talk, so go with someone on either
a non-verbal or shouting basis, and
be up for it.
Stocky Steve Miller opened up
with a warble kind of wave shaper
for Space Cowboy; then he put on
a sustainer to do a nice floating
lead on a blues, proving again that
blues is a classical form that never
fades as long as people like Miller

are around to do it properly. Ever
since Mary Ford (remember Les
Paul and Mary Ford?) first taught
him the chords, Steve has been
wheeling around: with Barry
Goldberg in Chicago in '66, Sailor,
and Brave New World.
The present quartet was in fine
form when we were there, and did
a long set, including a medley of
the Children of the Future album,
McCartney's 000 You, and,
especially at the start of the set,
some groovy jams. Country Joe
was the first I've seen to do a solo
on the Winterland stage, and he
did a convincing act with friendly
raps, softer interpretations of
"Sweet Martha Lorraine,"
"Martha's Return," "Janis," and a
song about flying to Algeria. He's
in the movie Zachariah, which has
something to do with a CIA boy

and a Peace Corps girl in South
America.
Big Brother and the Holding
Company, led by David Gety on
drums and James Gurley on bass
(hear him on treble guitar on the
Cheap Thrills album or especially
in the incredible movie Monterey)
was also flying. A new member is
David Shallock, and Nick
Gravenites shares the vocals with
Sam Amdrew; the result is thick,
snewy, scruffy, SF folk music.
Rita Coolidge (who did
Superstar with the Mad Dogs &
Englishmen) puts out a wall of
sound with the nine piece band
Roxy, and the light show by Holy
See, although marred by
amateurish handling of the
graphics projectors, was real fine:
the liquid projections were the
product of true genius.
