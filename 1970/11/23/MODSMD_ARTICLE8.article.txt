# A 						Somber Finish Ends An Exceptional' Year
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Cleats beat on the maze of
wooden stairs at the end of the
concrete tunnel. Besides that, the
end of Stanford's most successful
football season in 19 years was
strictly silent.
Behind the locked doors
players stared at the floor and
John Ralston did some slow
pacing.
After a few minutes the Big
Red Machine and all that was
reduced to a pile of sweat- and
grass-stained pants and jerseys in
the middle of the floor.
California had beaten Stanford
2 2-14, and with successive losses
in two weeks the Indians would
be limping into the Rose Bowl 8 -3
instead of going with a proud
10-1.
Ralston ordered the doors
open and accepted all the blame,
as usual.
"We were out-coached out
outplayed. Somewhere we lost
that momentum after clinching
the Rose Bowl. That's a personal
thing with me. I've got to find
where we lost it.
"We've got a big job in
regrouping but we've got a month
and a half to do it. It's a one-game
shot. This is too good a team to
close in defeat."
But it wasn't the coach who
made the fumble, or threw the
short pass or committed the
penalty. In fact, maybe nobody
made that penalty.
Some Call
That was the interference call
in the endzone on a

hope-and-prayer long pass from
Dave Penhall that gave Cal the ball
on Stanford's one, setting up the
Bear's winning touchdown.
Mike Ewing and Jack Schultz
were allegedly guilty, charged by
the head linesman who came clear
across the field to make the call.
"I don't know," Schultz said
afterward. "1 was really surprised
at the call, period. I'm not at all
positive I didn't bump him some."
There were, of course, a few
happier incidences, like two long
touchdown passes and a tight
goal-line stand.
Cal took four plays from
the Stanford two in the second
quarter and couldn't score. On
fourth down and less than half a
yard, Tom Sones broke through
Cal's line and dumped
quarterback Dave Penhall who
was rolling to his left.
"I got ahold of his foot,"
Sones said. "I was surprised he
rolled out in that situation. I was
lucky to get a hand on him."
Good Fake
Down 13-0 late in the first
half, Stanford moved from its 20
to the Cal 38 where it faced a
third and one. Plunkett faked a
handoff straight ahead, then
dropped back and threw long to
Randy Vataha in the endzone.
"It came in from the bench,"
Plunkett said quietly. "It was the
same play we had called back
against Washington."
In the third quarter the Tribe
took its only lead, 14-13, on
another long pass, this one coming
on a third and 28 play from the
Stanford 26.

Jackie Brown gathered a
medium-long pass, found running
room, then took to the sidelines
and out-raced everybody.
So much for the glory.
Stanford had two chances to
win the game in the final quarter
and couldn't make either go.
The Tribe drove 61 yards to
the Cal nine, but threw three
incomplete passes and gave up the
ball. "I thought long and hard
about running when we were third
and three," Ralston said. "I may
have made a mistake."
The other opportunity came
with 5:36 left, Stanford getting
good field position on the Cal 48.
Plunkett ran for 11 yards, then
fumbled.
Cal held the ball for four
minutes and kicked a field goal to
end it.
No Question
Nobody wanted to ask
Plunkett about either drive.
Instead, he related a few Rose
Bowl cliches to the quietly
nodding heads and that was that.
Ralston will give his players a
week off now to recover from a
host minor wounds and maybe
forget football for awhile. Then
it's back to practice, and Ralston
says he'll start with blocking and
tackling fundamentals and go
from there.
After losing the first game this
season, what now seems like a
long time ago, Ralston told his
players, "If you beat USC next
week nobody will remember
Purdue." It'll take a win over
Ohio State to forget Cal and Air
Force.
