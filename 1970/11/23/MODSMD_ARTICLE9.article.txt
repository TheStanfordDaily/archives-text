# PAC Tactics Fizzle

Despite numerous threats from
the People's Athletic Committee
and local yippies that they would
stop and disrupt it, the Big Game
went on as usual Saturday.
Almost. The organizers'
predictions of 5,000 supporters
were a bit off, as only 75
protestors marched from Sproul
Plaza to the stadium gate where
they were turned back by a
handful of police.
However a minor disturbance
did occur during the Stanford
band's halftime show. But it
ended quickly with three
protestors being arrested, one of
whom left the stadium
unconscious.
While the LSJUMB was
performing its generation gap
halftime show, Sam "Jim Thorpe
Yippie" Goldberg, athletic
director of the Youth
International Party, ran on the
field with a National Liberation
Front flag. During the Cal band's
pre-game show, the former Kansas
University decathalon star had
come on the field, but had
quickly returned into the stands.
This time however, when a
band member and the band's
equipment manager tried to escort
him off the field, he ran.
Unfortunately he ran into another
bandsmen and while the rest of
the band played on, about ten
members attacked Goldberg.
A couple of Goldberg's
supporters tried to come to his
rescue and one did succeed in

getting the NLF flag. But he was
quickly tackled by three of the 5 0
odd policemen who charged onto
the field.
The action ended shortly and
the police led the three arrestees
out of the stadium to the cheers
of much of the crowd. The band
continued their halftime show
without any interruption of their
music. The show concluded with a
remark by Hal Mickelson about

how "the gentle soldiers of peace
and love (the band) had
triumphed over the forces of
anarchy."
The unconscious Goldberg was
treated at a local hospital and
then booked on charges of
disturbing the peace. His two
companions, Anthony Wilde, 26,
and Steve Wasserman, 18, were
charged with resisting arrest in
addition to disturbing the peace.
