# Protesters Smash Windows In Brief Foray Last Night
## 
### ED KOHN 
The Indochinese War apparently
precipitated another season of sporadic,
guerilla-type violence as about 100
persons last night broke at least 5 0
windows in six University buildings.
Damage centered around the Physics
Tank and the Durand Aeronautics and
Astronautics Building as an "action
meeting" called to protest U.S.

Radical groups have scheduled a
noon rally today in White Plaza to
protest the increased bombing and
incursion into North Vietnam.
Following the rally, they plan to march
to the Menlo Park offices of the
Stanford Research Institute.
Members of several radical
organizations are still attempting to
arrange a convocation for 8 p.m.
tonight to discuss the Indochina
situation. Attempts to secure Memorial
Church for such a convocation have
failed, and the groups presently have no
meeting hall.

activities in North Vietnam (see
related story, this page) broke up
amidst loud chants of "Trash Aero and
Astro."
Many of those involved in the
rock-throwing and in the meeting that
preceeded it appeared to be members
of the Bay Area Revolutionary Union,
the White Panthers, "street people" and
high school — and younger — students.
The younger students appeared to be
the first to begin throwing rocks.

Santa Clara SherifFs Sergeant Don
Tamm said that no arrests were made.
Police and sheriff's forces were
apparently caught off-guard, and no
police cars were in sight during the
actual attack on the buildings, which
was carried out on the run.
The only sign of officialdom was a
lone Stanford Fire Department
pumper, which cruised by the Aero and
Astro Building several times during the
rock throwing. The senior officer on
the truck said he did not see any rocks
being thrown, according to Bruce
Wiggins, the University's director of
public safety.
No injuries were reported, although
Daily correspondents observed
numerous instances of rocks — and in
at least two cases, freshly-dug railroad
spikes — being thrown through
windows where the rooms were
occupied. In the Aero and Astro
Building, occupants hurriedly drew
curtains across the windows to present
less of a target to the strong-armed
marksmen.
No Estimate Available
No official estimate of damages was
available last night.
University officials were quick to
offer comment after the trashing.
President Lyman expressed disgust at
the protest:
"I hope the student body is going to
get fed up enough with this irrelevency
to make clear that it shouldn't happen
again. I find it very discouraging. Short
of having a couple of thousand of
armed guards there's no way to prevent

it. I had no foreknowledge that
anything like this was going to
happen."
John Schwartz, special assistant to
the president, said, "The only thing we
can do is to ask as many people as
possible to identify people involved.
There isn't any way to prevent
hit-and-run tactics at all.
Identifications Sought
"Our hope is that more and more
people will help us identify the people
involved. That is the most we have
going for us," he added.
He said that prosecution, if any,
would be handled through both the
University and Santa Clara County.
Any formal investigation, he said,
would be conducted by the sheriff's
department but his office will gather
information.
Schwartz added that, since the
University had no warning of
impending radical activities, no faculty
patrols or any official observers were
on hand.
The movement to attack the
building was a spontaneous decision
that developed after nearly an hour's
discussion at the rally on how to focus
community attention on the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI). The Institute
was denounced by several well-known
speakers, including Harry Cleaver, Jim
Shoch and Lennie Siegel, for its ties
with the Department of Defense and
the Indochinese War.
200 Demonstrators
Nearly 200 persons were in
attendance at the start of the meeting.

Nearly three-quarters of the 150
remaining after the discussion in the
cold, damp evening got up after shouts
of "Let's off the pig" and "Trash Aero
and Astro" and moved to Panama
Street, chanting "Free Erica, Kill
America"and "One-two-three-four, we
don't, want your fucking war." About
30 people remained in the Old Union
Courtyard, site of the rally, to discuss
the situation and debate the merits of
the impending action.
As the marchers passed by gardens
and shrubbery, some of them reached
down and scooped up rocks from the
soil.

Outer Quad, paused for a moment, and,
picking up more rocks, began its
familiar running attack around the
Physics Tank, past the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, the Electronics
Research Laboratory and Petroleum
Engineering, and moved to the
McCullough Engineering and Aero and
Astro Buildings.
At this point, many of the
demonstrators were winded, and a
fistfight errupted between some of the
demonstrators and a student who
apparently had been working in the
Aero and Astro Building. The group
retreated to the parking lot across the

street, threw a few more rocks at cars
and the Illumination Laboratory there,
and slowly drifted toward Tresidder
Memorial Union.
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Pat C. Shea, who followed the
demonstrators at close range,
denounced the rock throwing: "This is
the same type of hysterical crap we
suffered through last spring. The
decision students will be making this
year is whether or not they will allow
this type of action.

Many of those involved in the
rock-throwing and in the meeting that
preceeded it appeared to be members
of the Bay Area Revolutionary Union,
the White Panthers, "street people" and
high school — and younger — students.
The younger students appeared to be
the first to begin throwing rocks.

Santa Clara SherifFs Sergeant Don
Tamm said that no arrests were made.
Police and sheriff's forces were
apparently caught off-guard, and no
police cars were in sight during the
actual attack on the buildings, which
was carried out on the run.
The only sign of officialdom was a
lone Stanford Fire Department
pumper, which cruised by the Aero and
Astro Building several times during the
rock throwing. The senior officer on
the truck said he did not see any rocks
being thrown, according to Bruce
Wiggins, the University's director of
public safety.
No injuries were reported, although
Daily correspondents observed
numerous instances of rocks — and in
at least two cases, freshly-dug railroad
spikes — being thrown through
windows where the rooms were
occupied. In the Aero and Astro
Building, occupants hurriedly drew
curtains across the windows to present
less of a target to the strong-armed
marksmen.
No Estimate Available
No official estimate of damages was
available last night.
University officials were quick to
offer comment after the trashing.
President Lyman expressed disgust at
the protest:
"I hope the student body is going to
get fed up enough with this irrelevency
to make clear that it shouldn't happen
again. I find it very discouraging. Short
of having a couple of thousand of
armed guards there's no way to prevent

it. I had no foreknowledge that
anything like this was going to
happen."
John Schwartz, special assistant to
the president, said, "The only thing we
can do is to ask as many people as
possible to identify people involved.
There isn't any way to prevent
hit-and-run tactics at all.
Identifications Sought
"Our hope is that more and more
people will help us identify the people
involved. That is the most we have

He said that prosecution, if any,
would be handled through both the
University and Santa Clara County.
Any formal investigation, he said,
would be conducted by the sheriff's
department but his office will gather
information.
Schwartz added that, since the
University had no warning of
impending radical activities, no faculty
patrols or any official observers were
on hand.
The movement to attack the
building was a spontaneous decision
that developed after nearly an hour's
discussion at the rally on how to focus
community attention on the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI). The Institute
was denounced by several well-known
speakers, including Harry Cleaver, Jim
Shoch and Lennie Siegel, for its ties
with the Department of Defense and
the Indochinese War.
200 Demonstrators
Nearly 200 persons were in
attendance at the start of the meeting.

Nearly three-quarters of the 150
remaining after the discussion in the
cold, damp evening got up after shouts
of "Let's off the pig" and "Trash Aero
and Astro" and moved to Panama
Street, chanting "Free Erica, Kill
America"and "One-two-three-four, we
don't, want your fucking war." About
30 people remained in the Old Union
Courtyard, site of the rally, to discuss
the situation and debate the merits of
the impending action.
As the marchers passed by gardens
and shrubbery, some of them reached
down and scooped up rocks from the
soil.

Police and sheriff's forces were
apparently caught off-guard, and no
police cars were in sight during the
actual attack on the buildings, which
was carried out on the run.
The only sign of officialdom was a
lone Stanford Fire Department
pumper, which cruised by the Aero and
Astro Building several times during the
rock throwing. The senior officer on
the truck said he did not see any rocks
being thrown, according to Bruce
Wiggins, the University's director of
public safety.
No injuries were reported, although
Daily correspondents observed
numerous instances of rocks — and in
at least two cases, freshly-dug railroad
spikes — being thrown through
windows where the rooms were
occupied. In the Aero and Astro
Building, occupants hurriedly drew
curtains across the windows to present
less of a target to the strong-armed
marksmen.
No Estimate Available
No official estimate of damages was
available last night.
University officials were quick to
offer comment after the trashing.
President Lyman expressed disgust at
the protest:
"I hope the student body is going to
get fed up enough with this irrelevency
to make clear that it shouldn't happen
again. I find it very discouraging. Short
of having a couple of thousand of
armed guards there's no way to prevent

it. I had no foreknowledge that
anything like this was going to
happen."
John Schwartz, special assistant to
the president, said, "The only thing we
can do is to ask as many people as
possible to identify people involved.
There isn't any way to prevent
hit-and-run tactics at all.
Identifications Sought
"Our hope is that more and more
people will help us identify the people
involved. That is the most we have
going for us," he added.
He said that prosecution, if any,
would be handled through both the
University and Santa Clara County.
Any formal investigation, he said,
would be conducted by the sheriff's
department but his office will gather
information.
Schwartz added that, since the
University had no warning of
impending radical activities, no faculty
patrols or any official observers were
on hand.
The movement to attack the
building was a spontaneous decision
that developed after nearly an hour's
discussion at the rally on how to focus
community attention on the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI). The Institute
was denounced by several well-known
speakers, including Harry Cleaver, Jim
Shoch and Lennie Siegel, for its ties
with the Department of Defense and
the Indochinese War.
200 Demonstrators
Nearly 200 persons were in
attendance at the start of the meeting.

Nearly three-quarters of the 150
remaining after the discussion in the
cold, damp evening got up after shouts
of "Let's off the pig" and "Trash Aero
and Astro" and moved to Panama
Street, chanting "Free Erica, Kill
America"and "One-two-three-four, we
don't, want your fucking war." About
30 people remained in the Old Union
Courtyard, site of the rally, to discuss
the situation and debate the merits of
the impending action.
As the marchers passed by gardens
and shrubbery, some of them reached
down and scooped up rocks from the
soil.

Outer Quad, paused for a moment, and,
picking up more rocks, began its
familiar running attack around the
Physics Tank, past the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, the Electronics
Research Laboratory and Petroleum
Engineering, and moved to the
McCullough Engineering and Aero and
Astro Buildings.
At this point, many of the
demonstrators were winded, and a
fistfight errupted between some of the
demonstrators and a student who
apparently had been working in the
Aero and Astro Building. The group
retreated to the parking lot across the

street, threw a few more rocks at cars
and the Illumination Laboratory there,
and slowly drifted toward Tresidder
Memorial Union.
ASSU Council of Presidents member
Pat C. Shea, who followed the
demonstrators at close range,
denounced the rock throwing: "This is
the same type of hysterical crap we
suffered through last spring. The
decision students will be making this
year is whether or not they will allow
this type of action.
