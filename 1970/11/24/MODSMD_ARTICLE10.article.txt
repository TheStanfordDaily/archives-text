My Lai Trial
FT. BENNING, Ga. (AP) — A helicopter pilot testified
Monday that he received little or no cooperation from
American Gls while trying to rescue wounded civilians at
My Lai. But there was no mention of Lt. William ('alley Jr.
in his recital of alleged atrocities committed against
unarmed Vietnamese.
Calley's court-martial jury heard the witness, Lt. Hugh
Thompson, 27, testify that he landed beside a ditch where
from 5 0 to 100 old men, women and children lay dead or
wounded. He said he asked an American Negro sergeant,
"Is there any way I can help the wounded?"
"He said something to the effect that the only way I
could help them was to put them out of their misery," said
Thompson.
"There were just a lot of bodies in there women, kids,
babies, old men. Some of them were dead, some of them
were alive ..."
Thompson, then a warrant officer, flew reconnaissance
for Charlie Company on its March 16, 1968 assault on My
Lai. Calley, 27, headed the company's 1 st platoon and is on
trial for his life, charged with premeditated murder of 102
unresisting Vietnamese civilians, including those in the
ditch.
Prison Strike Ends
FOLSOM (AP) — After 18 days, the longest general
lock—up in the 80 year history of Folsom Prison ended
Monday in what Warden Walter Craven called a "common
sense" victory for both prisoners and staff.
The lockup of more than2,ooo inmates began Nov. 5
after a work strike halted inmate labor two days before.
Twenty-four inmates refused to leave their cells
Monday, and about 20 to 25 per cent of prisoners stayed
away from jobs and other activities, Craven said.
During the lockup, Warden Craven said 29 men were put
in the prison adjustment center termed the "hole" by
prisoners and four other prisoners were transferred to other
institutions in the state.
Craven said none of the 31 demands in a "Folsom Prison
Manifesto" smuggled out of the granite-walled maximum
security institution were considered by prison authorities
during the lockup.
Two of the demands - for improved privileges and for
improved medical service - were covered by earlier prison
studies and building improvements this year, Craven said.
The warden has charged that outside groups were

responsible for the work strike but lawyers defending
prisoners inside Folsom say the strike originated from
inside the prison, and was planned at least three months in
advance of the election day work stoppage.
Supreme Court Ruling
WASHINGTON (AP) — A man who says he is really
innocent but is pleading guilty only because he fears a jury
might return a stiffer sentence should be permitted to do
so, the Supreme Court held Monday in a 6-3 ruling.
The decision, in a North Carolina murder case, found
such guilty pleas voluntary in a constitutional sense and
said they preserve very human values by allowing
defendants to avoid a death sentence or other grim
alternatives.
Most people who plead guilty admit also they are guilty.
But even if they argue they are innocent and motivated
only by a desire to escape a tougher sentence, said Justice
Byron R. White for the majority, trial judges should accept
their pleas.
The decision indicates a hardening stand by the court in
criminal cases. Significant, also, is that Black man cast his
vote along conservative lines.
Nixon Veto Sustained
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Senate sustained Monday-
President Nixon's veto of a bill to limit campaign spending
for radio and television broadcasts, after a Republican
leader called the measure a step backwards in the quest for
broad political reform.
The roll call vote was 58 in favor of overriding the
President, 34 against, a margin of 4 votes short of the
necessary two-thirds.
Nine Republicans joined 4 9 Democrats in voting to
override but six Democrats joined 28 Republicans in
making the veto stick. Since the Senate has sustained the
President there is no need for the House to vote.
Sen. John O. Pastore, D-R.L, chief sponsor of the
broadcast limit measure, said in advance that to sustain the
veto would deal a probably fatal setback to reform.
"You pass this up today and you can forget it," Pastore
cried. "Don't refuse to take this giant step today."
Republican Leader Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania pledged
an effort at comprehensive campaign reform next year, and
Nixon said the administration would work with him.
