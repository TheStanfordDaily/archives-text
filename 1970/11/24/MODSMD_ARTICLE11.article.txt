# Lyman Explains Rose Bowl Income
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In a press, conference which ran the
gamut of issues - from campus
disruption to budget cuts in the
University - President Richard Lyman
commented extensively yesterday
morning on the breakdown of the
revenue from the Jan. 1 Rose Bow!
game.
Lyman explained that the income
produced by the Rose Bowl, including
"about $1 million" in television rights,
is placed in a general pool. 25 per cent
of the pool goes to the Rose Bowl
Association, and the remaining 75 per
cent is divided equally between the Big
10 and the Pacific Eight football
conferences.
The conferences in turn divide
their share of the proceeds equally
between their members.
Lyman estimated the University's
share at $123,000-$1 35,000, in
addition to the $90,000 which
Stanford, as Pac-a Rose Bowl
representative, receives to cover the
expenses it incurs for travel, room and
board, and related costs.
Travel Service Tickets
He also denied charges that a part of
the University's ticket allotment is
being sold to travel services. "There's
no truth at all in this," he said. "We're
told that these organizations get their
tickets... by buying up tickets that
have been sold to legitimite buyers —
students, season ticket holders, and so
forth."
During the pre-taped session, which
will be broadcast tonight at seven p.m.
over KZSU, questioners driiled Lyman
on various aspects of campus
disruptions — both general questions
and specifics relating to last Spring's
demonstrations.
Asked by Arena co-editor Chris
Hocker whether the administration had
specific tactics planned for dealing with
disruptions, or whether they intended

"to play it by ear", Lyman replied,
"It's hard to talk about specific tactics
without committing a strategic error.
"This (error) is to get oneself locked
into positions that may be totally
irrelevant to whatever the problem is at
the moment.
"I think we face a real difficulty in
making that point without giving
people the impression that we're giving
no thought to the question," he added.
Lyman also denied a rumor
mentioned by Hocker that the
administration was "not worrying
about student legislation" and
"planning to send in police
immediately upon the sitting-in of a
building."
Disruption Policies
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council, a student-faculty
administration group of which Hocker
is a member, is presently considering
whether or not to pass legislation
specifying violations of the
fundamental standard and the

University Policy on campus
disruption.
"I don't want to suggest off the top
of my head what the SCLC would be
best advised to do," continued Lyman.
"I have some feeling that legislation
should be as simple as is compatible
with fairness and adequacy to the
problems we face."
Clarifying the three options now
open to faculty members who wish to
play a role during a disruption - that of
monitor, observer, or member of a
building surveillance team - Lyman
commented, "Chiefly, we're trying to
be a little bit clearer as to the various
kinds of roles faculty can usefully play.
"What actually turns out to be
useful depends on what the problem is
at the moment.
"In each of the last couple of years,
there has been a need to do this in a
considerable rush. It's less likely to get
done well if it has to be done under
pressure," he added.

share at $123,000-$1 35,000, in
addition to the $90,000 which
Stanford, as Pac-a Rose Bowl
representative, receives to cover the
expenses it incurs for travel, room and
board, and related costs.
Travel Service Tickets
He also denied charges that a part of
the University's ticket allotment is
being sold to travel services. "There's
no truth at all in this," he said. "We're
told that these organizations get their
tickets... by buying up tickets that
have been sold to legitimite buyers —
students, season ticket holders, and so
forth."
During the pre-taped session, which
will be broadcast tonight at seven p.m.
over KZSU, questioners driiled Lyman
on various aspects of campus
disruptions — both general questions
and specifics relating to last Spring's
demonstrations.
Asked by Arena co-editor Chris
Hocker whether the administration had
specific tactics planned for dealing with
disruptions, or whether they intended

"to play it by ear", Lyman replied,
"It's hard to talk about specific tactics
without committing a strategic error.
"This (error) is to get oneself locked
into positions that may be totally
irrelevant to whatever the problem is at
the moment.
"I think we face a real difficulty in
making that point without giving
people the impression that we're giving
no thought to the question," he added.
Lyman also denied a rumor
mentioned by Hocker that the
administration was "not worrying
about student legislation" and
"planning to send in police
immediately upon the sitting-in of a
building."
Disruption Policies
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council, a student-faculty
administration group of which Hocker
is a member, is presently considering
whether or not to pass legislation
specifying violations of the
fundamental standard and the

University Policy on campus
disruption.
"I don't want to suggest off the top
of my head what the SCLC would be
best advised to do," continued Lyman.
"I have some feeling that legislation
should be as simple as is compatible
with fairness and adequacy to the
problems we face."
Clarifying the three options now
open to faculty members who wish to
play a role during a disruption - that of
monitor, observer, or member of a
building surveillance team - Lyman
commented, "Chiefly, we're trying to
be a little bit clearer as to the various
kinds of roles faculty can usefully play.
"What actually turns out to be
useful depends on what the problem is
at the moment.
"In each of the last couple of years,
there has been a need to do this in a
considerable rush. It's less likely to get
done well if it has to be done under
pressure," he added.
In a press, conference which ran the
gamut of issues - from campus
disruption to budget cuts in the
University - President Richard Lyman
commented extensively yesterday
morning on the breakdown of the
revenue from the Jan. 1 Rose Bow!
game.
Lyman explained that the income
produced by the Rose Bowl, including
"about $1 million" in television rights,
is placed in a general pool. 25 per cent
of the pool goes to the Rose Bowl
Association, and the remaining 75 per
cent is divided equally between the Big
10 and the Pacific Eight football
conferences.
The conferences in turn divide
their share of the proceeds equally
between their members.
Lyman estimated the University's
share at $123,000-$1 35,000, in
