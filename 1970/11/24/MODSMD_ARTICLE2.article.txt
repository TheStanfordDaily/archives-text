## Three Year College Program Recommended 
### BOB LITTERMAN DAVE SPECTOR 
The Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education recommended yesterday a
reduction in time required to earn
college degrees and continuation of
formal education throughout a person's
lifetime.
The changes would also reduce
operating expenditures 10 to 15
percent a year by 198 0 and
construction expenditures by five
billion dollars during the 1 970's.
At a press conference held in San
Francisco, Commission chairman Clark
Kerr said, "these changes would go a
long way toward alleviating campus
unrest and even bridging the generation
It
gap.
The report proposes modifications
in four ways: 1. Shortening the time
required for formal education. 2.
Providing more options for youth. 3.
Making educational opportunities more
appropriate to lifetime interests. 4.
Educational opportunities should be
more readily available to more people,
including women, employed persons,
older people and persons from lower
income levels.

The difficulty in implementing the
reforms may come from university
faculties. "The most conservative group
in the world about their own affairs is a
university faculty, and at the same time
they're the most radical about
everybody else's business," Kerr stated.
The main thrust of the report is
altering the degree structure. The new
structure has four levels: the Associate
of Arts degree (A.A.) after one or two
years, the Bachelor of Arts (8.A.)
degree after three or four years, a
Master of Philosophy (M. Phil.) degree
after four or five years, and a Doctor of
Arts (D.A) or a Doctor of Philosophy
(Ph*D.) degree after seven or eight
years.
To shorten the time for the 8.A.,
the Commission suggested that high
schools be accredited by state
university systems to give the
equivalent of the first year of college
work. Now 50,000 students receive
credit for advanced standing in college;
this number could jump to 500,000.
The lower division in college would
become a one-year program except for
students needing remedial instruction.

The master of philosophy degree is
for persons intending to teach in high
schools, community colleges, and in the
lower division in colleges. It could also
serve occupations which require more
formal training than the one-year
Master of Arts now provides.
Standard Teaching Degree
The D.A. would be a specially
designed program that would become
the standard degree for college
teachers. The new degree would declare
that teaching is important and will be as
equally rewarded as research. The Ph.D.
will be a specialized degree for research
personnel; the pay scale for both
degrees will be the same.
"Wo now select and train a student
to do research; then employ him to
teach; and then promote him on the
basis of his research. This both confuses
him and subverts the teaching process."
The D.A. would change that trend.
The granting of a degree every two
years would give students more points
at which to reassess their direction,
takf time out for work experience, or
stop with credit.
To make the employment

alternatives effective, the Commission
urges that employers rely less on the
B.A. degree and more on independent
judgement and new tests of talents and
performance.
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
James Gibbs feels, "the Commission's
notion of alternating formal study with
practical experience would provide
students with a mature perspective
which would enrich not only the
students' lives, but the universities as
well.
Life Long Kducation
The report asserts that opportunities
should be created for persons
throughout their active careers to
re-enter higher education in regular
classes, night classes, summer courses
and special short-term programs with
degrees and certificates available.
To promote life-long learning and
extension of educational opportunity,
all persons, after high school
graduation, should have two years of
postsecondary education placed "in the
bank'" for them and to be withdrawn at
any time in their lives when it best suits
them.
