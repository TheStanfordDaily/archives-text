In Washington, Defense Secretary
Melvin R. Laird revealed that U.S.
Army and Air Force volunteers made a
daring but futile helicopter raid near
Hanoi to rescue American prisoners of
war. He said the camp was found
abandoned and the raiders departed
safely.
Laird originally said that was the
"only operation that took place north
of the 19 th parallel" in North Vietnam
over the weekend, while some 250 U.S.
fighter-bombers were pummelling the
North Vietnamese panhandle.
"Contradiction"
Later, Laird said the U.S. Navy
undertook a small diversionary air
mission, dropping flares over the North
Vietnamese coast above the 19 th
parallel to help carry off the rescue
attempt.
The defense secretary made his
startling disclosure about four hours
after a Pentagon spokesman steadfastly
refused to say whether U.S. warplanes
operated above the 19 th parallel during
the "protective reaction" strikes which
were billed as retaliation for North
Vietnamese downing of a U.S.
reconnaissance plane more than a week
ago.
The spokesman's refusal to say
anything about operations above the
19 th parallel left the United States at a
distinct propaganda disadvantage in
light of North Vietnamese claims last
Saturday that U.S. warplanes had hit a
prisoner of war camp, wounding a
number of American captives, and
struck in the vicinity of Haiphong and
Hanoi.
Laird previously denied that any
American prisoners had been harmed in
the bombing strikes arid the Pentagon
had spoken only of retaliation against
the North Vietnamese air defenses and
"telated facilities."

The daring raid, first ever inside
North Vietnam, was approved by
President Nixon several hours before it
was mounted. Many earlier efforts to
rescue individual pilots downed in
North Vietnam have been made but
this was the first camp raid.
Laird said he recommended the
operation because of "new information
we received this month that some of
our men were dying in prisoner-of-war
camps."
According to the latest Pentagon
figures there are 45 7 known U.S.
prisoners of war in North Vietnam and
an additional 1 ,090 missing.
"Fighting Continues"
The United States
kept up spy flights over North Vietnam
Monday in the face of mounting
protests and a move by the
Communists to boycott the Paris peace
talks because of the heavy weekend
bombing raids over the North.

The reconnaissance flights went out
to get photographs of the damage
inflicted in the bombing strikes even as
the controversy over the raids
increased.
While reconnaissance flights
continued over North Vietnam, scores
of American warplanes roamed over
Laos and Cambodia, supporting
embattled government troops in both
countries and bombing North
Vietnamese supply routes running
southward.
In South Vietnam, ground fighting
was at a low level, with only small
actions reported.
And in Paris, the North Vietnamese
and Viet Cong delegations to the peace
talks announced they would boycott
the next session scheduled for
Wednesday, although they said they
would return to the conference table
Dec. 3.
