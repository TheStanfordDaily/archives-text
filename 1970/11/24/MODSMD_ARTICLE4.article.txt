# Senate Results Out After Long Delay
## 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
A coalition of radical, left liberal
and minority group students has won a
clear majority in last month's elections
for the Student Senate.
In returns released last night by
Elections Commissioner Chris Banks,
the coalition of Black Students Union,
Radical Caucus, International
Association, and independent
candidates took 21 of the 4 0 seats at
stake.
The slate consisted 4 6 names; other
slates did not do so well. An .Arena
slate of 17 saw only two of its members
elected, and a Young
Republican-oriented slate got two of its
six members elected. At least four
other students of a "moderate" or
conservative viewpoint were also
elected.
Last year, an ad hoc coalition similar
to the one which won a majority voted
to organize the Senate by electing Dave
Kdwards chairman and -John Shoch
deputy chairman. The rest of the year
was marked by bitter infighting among
all factions particularly over the
distribution of ASSU funds.
Two other students can probably be
expected to vote with the majority
coalition on the basis of past
performance, and the remaining nine
are political unknowns.
The first Senate meeting will
probably be held next Thursday.
The list of alternates will be
available in a few days.
