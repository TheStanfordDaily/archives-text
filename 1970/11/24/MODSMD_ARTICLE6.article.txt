# Vietnam, Credibility...
## 
### 
Nixon's words, lower battle casualties, and
the wearisome continuum of a never-ending
war lulled many of us to sleep over the past
few months. "Vietnamization" had effectively
defused Indochina as a major issue, even
among most college students.
But, over the weekend, massive bombings
and a "Dirty Dozen" commando raid
reawakened some of us to the issue. Like the
Cambodian invasion, these raids injected a new
perspective on the Indochina War. They made
the weekly death tolls and the film clips on
Walter Cronkite seem less surreal and more
concrete.
Yet, even though these raids have
momentarily refocused attention on the war,
they are not the major issue. It may be another
six weeks or six months before the next
"protective reaction" strike, and by that time
a lot of us may be dozing again.
The main issue that we must respond to is
whether we support the Nixon policy of
Vietnamization and prolonged withdrawals.
We do not.
Our primary reason for opposing the
President is that the foundations of his
"Vietnamization" policy are cemented
together with the premise that the U.S. had a
right to intervene militarily in Vietnam. It

never had that right. The 1954 Geneva
Accords clearly established Vietnam as a single
country. So the Vietnam war is a revolutionary
civil war with an outside twist—U.S. military
intervention.
The war is wrong. We are interfering in the
internal affairs of another country and thus
undermining the principles of world law.
And what does Vietnamization mean?
Turning control of the fighting over to the
Saigon government with our blessing. To the
Saigon government—which bans or jails

opposition candidates and depends on an
assembly of the landed elite.
In addition, the vast strengthening of South
Vietnamese armed forces all but assures that
the dreary war which has been grinding on for
more than two decades will continue-and
always the same people suffer.
We must withdraw immediately, leaving the
Vietnamese to work their own wills. Increasing
planes and bombs does not decrease war.
One more thing. Remember the phrase

"credibility gap"? It came to prominence
during the Johnson Administration. The events
of this past weekend have proved that it is not
yet obsolete. For instance:
—Melvin Laird said Sunday that the U.S.
did not operate above the 19th parallel. The
New York Times Sunday described air raids
near Hanoi in a report from that city.
Yesterday Laird admitted his lie.
—The U.S. has consistently claimed that the
North Vietnamese agreed not to shoot at
reconaissance planes at the time of the 1968
bombing ceasefire, yet Sunday's Examiner tells
of a high-ranking Johnson Administration
official who denies that allegation.
— Lastly, don't forget the timing. It is highly
doubtful that the administration would have
publicly embarked on raids like these four
weeks ago, when Nixon was still stumping for
'his' candidates. There were no headlines about
protective retaliation then. Nixon may not
have been lying, but neither was he telling the
truth.
A comparison can be made between the
timing of this action and the timing of the
October 1968 bombing halt. There's
something obscene about toying with far-away
lives for immediate and transitory political
gain.
