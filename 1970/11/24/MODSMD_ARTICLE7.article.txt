# ...Rocks Again
## 
### 
It's almost like Spring.
The rocks are flying again.
The same rocks. The same
targets. The same glass.
But where is the sense?
Perhaps for revolutionaries it
could be the first spark of a
movement. And it will take a
while before we see whether the
'people' will follow.
Yet last night's destruction
seems counter-productive to the

point of absurdity. A few more
broken windows here are not
going to bring Richard Lyman,
Melvin Laird, or Richard Nixon to
their knees—now or ever. It will
not stop the bombing, the My
Lais, the oppression or the death.
It will do a lot to help people
ignore them.
It would be greatly
underestimating the intelligence
and sophistication of many
Stanford radicals to think that
they are not fully aware of this.
Even for revolutionaries, the
polarization that this kind of

action creates is not always
desirable.
Then why did it happen?
It was impossible to judge who,
if anyone, was leading the roving
band. One thing is certain—many
of the rocks were thrown by
students from high school, junior
high school, and even younger.
Many, but not all.
The 12-year-old rock-throwers
may have been the pawns in some
revolutionary's cosmic scheme for
the re-ordering of the world. Or it
may be that the young vanguard
were acting on their own visionary

ideals—smashing evil as
personified by a pane of
glass-and having a hell of a time.
And even if none of the familiar
radical figures were advocating the
action, there was no move to
discourage it.
So the rocks flew. And so did
the railroad spikes. Right through
the windows. In a few cases, right
by the heads of the people inside.
Last Spring proved that rocks can
maim. Last night's futile flailings
almost proved it again. Trading
off the real possibility of human
injury for pointless 'political'
action is perverted.
