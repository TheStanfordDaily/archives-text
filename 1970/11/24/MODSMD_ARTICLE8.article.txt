# Group Criticizes Entrance Exams

### 
A commission appointed by
the College Entrance Examination
Board recently released a report
criticizing the Board's testing
program for serving the interests
of the colleges, while disregarding
those interests of students.
The report, the first
comprehensive review in the
Board's 70 year history, proposed
development of tests to measure
talents other than verbal and
mathematical; job-entry testing in
vocational and technical areas;
and an objective test college

examinations would take to
provide students with a more
accurate basis for college
selection.
Patrick Suppes, member of the
commission and director of the
Institute for Mathematical Studies
in the Social Sciences here,
praised the report for,
"recognizing that the student has
a right to know before he applies
the criteria use by colleges for
admission. This is a brand new
idea and represents progress.
"I'm skeptical of the

objectivity of the admissions
process," says Suppes. "There is
too much discretionary power in
admissions departments, not here
though."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon sees a danger that the
College Board, which services
schools, is beginning to feel with
that much power that they should
decide what the social uses of the
tests should be.
"The College Board would be
determining what colleges should
do in education."

Hargadon doesn't feel the tests
will affect the admissions process
for a while. "We ought not seek
information unless we know what
we'll do with it. The data
wouldn't be used for a useful
purpose."
The planned tests will measure
musical and artistic talent;
sensitivity and commitment to
social responsibility; political and
social leadership; athletic,
political, and mechanical skills;
styles of analysis and synthesis;
ability to express oneself through
artistic, oral, nonverbal or graphic
means; ability to manage
information; ability to adapt to
new situations; characteristics of
temperment; sources and status of
motivation; and work habits
under varying conditions of
demand.
The test the college
administrations would take
includes statistics on class size,
time spent in class by professors,
faculty-student ratio, number of
students who drop out each year
and why, and a measure, obtained
from student questionaires, of the
school's social and intellectual
climate.
A college administration would
be required to take the test before
it would be eligible to receive any
student's college board test scores.
Information about students
and colleges would be fed into a
computerized college entrance
service that would attempt to
match students' characteristics to
colleges of appropriate character.
The prototype of such a service is
now undergoing trials.

provide students with a more
accurate basis for college
selection.
Patrick Suppes, member of the
commission and director of the
Institute for Mathematical Studies
in the Social Sciences here,
praised the report for,
"recognizing that the student has
a right to know before he applies
the criteria use by colleges for
admission. This is a brand new
idea and represents progress.
"I'm skeptical of the

objectivity of the admissions
process," says Suppes. "There is
too much discretionary power in
admissions departments, not here
though."
Dean of Admissions Fred
Hargadon sees a danger that the
College Board, which services
schools, is beginning to feel with
that much power that they should
decide what the social uses of the
tests should be.
"The College Board would be
determining what colleges should
do in education."

Hargadon doesn't feel the tests
will affect the admissions process
for a while. "We ought not seek
information unless we know what
we'll do with it. The data
wouldn't be used for a useful
purpose."
The planned tests will measure
musical and artistic talent;
sensitivity and commitment to
social responsibility; political and
social leadership; athletic,
political, and mechanical skills;
styles of analysis and synthesis;
ability to express oneself through
artistic, oral, nonverbal or graphic
means; ability to manage
information; ability to adapt to
new situations; characteristics of
temperment; sources and status of
motivation; and work habits
under varying conditions of
demand.
The test the college
administrations would take
includes statistics on class size,
time spent in class by professors,
faculty-student ratio, number of
students who drop out each year
and why, and a measure, obtained
from student questionaires, of the
school's social and intellectual
climate.
A college administration would
be required to take the test before
it would be eligible to receive any
student's college board test scores.
Information about students
and colleges would be fed into a
computerized college entrance
service that would attempt to
match students' characteristics to
colleges of appropriate character.
The prototype of such a service is
now undergoing trials.
A commission appointed by
the College Entrance Examination
Board recently released a report
criticizing the Board's testing
program for serving the interests
of the colleges, while disregarding
those interests of students.
The report, the first
comprehensive review in the
Board's 70 year history, proposed
development of tests to measure
talents other than verbal and
mathematical; job-entry testing in
vocational and technical areas;
and an objective test college

examinations would take to
provide students with a more
accurate basis for college
selection.
