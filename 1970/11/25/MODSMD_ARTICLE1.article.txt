# Plunkett Voted Heisman Trophy By Large Margin In Balloting
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Sweeping ballots from every region
of the nation, quarterback Jim Plunkett
was voted outstanding football player
of the year yesterday and winner of the
Heisman Trophy.
"I'm in an emotional knot,"
Plunkett told the Athletic Department
via telephone from New York minutes
after the announcement from the
Downtown Athletic Club, which
sponsors the contest.
He was in New York Tuesday
filming an Ail-American television
special with ABC and returned to
campus late last night.
Plunkett received 2229 votes to
1410 for Notre Dame quarterback Joe
Theismann and 849 for Mississippi
quarterback Archie Manning.
"He won in every section in the
country, including the South," said
Bob Murphy, sports information
director.
Plunkett received more than twice as
many first-place votes as Theismann.
Texas running back Steve Worster was
fourth in the voting with 398 votes and
Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern was
fifth with 188.
In his phone call Plunkett said the
award was a reflection on his coaches
and teammates and that he hoped to
share the award with them.

When the announcement came, he
was taping the ABC film with
telecasters Chris Schenkel and Bud
Wilkinson and Ohio State cornerback
Jack Tat urn.
Plunkett's presence in New York at
the time of the announcement was
coincidental, Murphy said. Plunkett
went from the ABC studio to the
Downtown Athletic Club after the
announcement.
"It caught me by surprise," he told
the assembled news media. "I didn't
think it would be announced until the
Dec. 3 dinner."
Plunkett is the first Stanford player
to win what is considered the nation's
most important football award.
"There are some pretty excited
people out here, I'll tell you that,"
Murphy told the Downtown A.C. after
the announcement.
At Stanford, first notice of the
award came on 10 a.m. radio news
Tuesday. "We were promised a call at
9:45 if he had won, and a call at 10 if
he lost," Murphy said. "No call came.
Everybody had his head down around
here."
Coach John Ralston's comment was,
"It's great."
In a written statement Ralston said,
"Jim has performed to our utmost
expectation in all 31 consecutive
games he has started as the Stanford

quarterback. No one could have
contributed more to the success of the
team than he has during this time. He is
certainly deserving of this highest
honor accorded an intercollegiate
football player."
"That may sound a little canned,"
he said, "but that expresses my
opinion."
In his third year the 6-3, 205 -pound
quarterback set new national career
records in total offense and passing,
and led the Indians to their first Rose
Bowl appearance in 19 years.
Plunkett's three year offense total is
7,887 yards, more than 1,000 yards
ahead of the previous record.
This year he has thrown 358 passes,
completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is
now the holder of 11 Pacific-8 passing
and offense records.
The Heisman Trophy will be
presented at a formal dinner Dec. 3 at
the Downtown Athletic Club. Those
who probably will attend from Stanford
include President and Mrs. Richard
Lyman, head football coach John
Ralston and his wife, offensive
back field coach Jack Christiansen and
his wife, athletic director Chuck Taylor
and his wife, Murphy and his wife and
Plunkett and his mother, Mrs. Carmen
Plunkett, or one of his older sisters -

Mary Ann or Genevieve — if Mrs.
Plunkett's health prevents her from
traveling. She has a heart condition.
Heisman ballots are mailed from
selected sportswriters and broadcasters
across the nation. Voting is done on a
3-2-1 basis for first, second and third
places.
Plunkett received 510 first-place
votes, 285 seconds and 129 thirds.
Theismann got 2 4 2 first place votes and
Manning 1 38.
Others in the voting were Pat
Sullivan, Auburn quarterback, sixth;
Tatum, seventh; Ernie Jennings, Air
Force flanker, eighth; Don McCauley,
North Carolina running back, ninth;
and Lynn Dickey, Kansas State
quarterback, 10 th.
