# Plunkett Voted Heisman Trophy By Large Margin In Balloting
## 
### FRED LEESON 
Sweeping ballots from every region
of the nation, quarterback Jim Plunkett
was voted outstanding football player
of the year yesterday and winner of the
Heisman Trophy.
"I'm in an emotional knot,"
Plunkett told the Athletic Department
via telephone from New York minutes
after the announcement from the
Downtown Athletic Club, which
sponsors the contest.
He was in New York Tuesday
filming an Ail-American television
special with ABC and returned to
campus late last night.
Plunkett received 2229 votes to
1410 for Notre Dame quarterback Joe
Theismann and 849 for Mississippi
quarterback Archie Manning.
"He won in every section in the
country, including the South," said
Bob Murphy, sports information
director.
Plunkett received more than twice as
many first-place votes as Theismann.
Texas running back Steve Worster was
fourth in the voting with 398 votes and
Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern was
fifth with 188.
In his phone call Plunkett said the
award was a reflection on his coaches
and teammates and that he hoped to
share the award with them.

When the announcement came, he
was taping the ABC film with
telecasters Chris Schenkel and Bud
Wilkinson and Ohio State cornerback
Jack Tat urn.
Plunkett's presence in New York at
the time of the announcement was
coincidental, Murphy said. Plunkett
went from the ABC studio to the
Downtown Athletic Club after the
announcement.
"It caught me by surprise," he told
the assembled news media. "I didn't
think it would be announced until the
Dec. 3 dinner."
Plunkett is the first Stanford player
to win what is considered the nation's
most important football award.
"There are some pretty excited
people out here, I'll tell you that,"
Murphy told the Downtown A.C. after
the announcement.
At Stanford, first notice of the
award came on 10 a.m. radio news
Tuesday. "We were promised a call at
9:45 if he had won, and a call at 10 if
he lost," Murphy said. "No call came.
Everybody had his head down around
here."
Coach John Ralston's comment was,
"It's great."
In a written statement Ralston said,
"Jim has performed to our utmost
expectation in all 31 consecutive
games he has started as the Stanford

quarterback. No one could have
contributed more to the success of the
team than he has during this time. He is
certainly deserving of this highest
honor accorded an intercollegiate
football player."
"That may sound a little canned,"
he said, "but that expresses my
opinion."
In his third year the 6-3, 205 -pound
quarterback set new national career
records in total offense and passing,
and led the Indians to their first Rose
Bowl appearance in 19 years.
Plunkett's three year offense total is
7,887 yards, more than 1,000 yards
ahead of the previous record.
This year he has thrown 358 passes,
completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is
now the holder of 11 Pacific-8 passing
and offense records.
The Heisman Trophy will be
presented at a formal dinner Dec. 3 at
the Downtown Athletic Club. Those
who probably will attend from Stanford
include President and Mrs. Richard
Lyman, head football coach John
Ralston and his wife, offensive
back field coach Jack Christiansen and
his wife, athletic director Chuck Taylor
and his wife, Murphy and his wife and
Plunkett and his mother, Mrs. Carmen
Plunkett, or one of his older sisters -

Mary Ann or Genevieve — if Mrs.
Plunkett's health prevents her from
traveling. She has a heart condition.
Heisman ballots are mailed from
selected sportswriters and broadcasters
across the nation. Voting is done on a
3-2-1 basis for first, second and third
places.
Plunkett received 510 first-place
votes, 285 seconds and 129 thirds.
Theismann got 2 4 2 first place votes and
Manning 1 38.
Others in the voting were Pat
Sullivan, Auburn quarterback, sixth;
Tatum, seventh; Ernie Jennings, Air
Force flanker, eighth; Don McCauley,
North Carolina running back, ninth;
and Lynn Dickey, Kansas State
quarterback, 10 th.

CANDIDATE NO LONGER—Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett fires one of
the many passes t ; 'is season that led the Tribe to the Rose Bowl and enabled him
to break NCAA records for total offense and passing.
"He won by such a margin there was
no question about it," Murphy said.
The Heisman Trophy has been the
object of considerable debate lately
because of the publicity programs
launched by schools who hope to win
it for one of their players.
Stanford's approach has been
lower-keyed than those at Notre Dame
and Mississippi this year. The sports
information department put out a
four-page, black-and-white flyer a
month ago which was devoted to
Plunkett, and followed it with a
two-page 9 by 16 sheet released last
week calling attention to Plunkett, five
other players and Ralston.
An hour after the Heisman
announcement yesterday, word arrived
that Ralston had been selected "Coach
of the Year" by The Sporting News, a
weekly sports publication.
Last night, when Plunkett descended
the escalator into United Airline's
red-carpeted VIP lounge, in San
Francisco he was greeted by nearly 150
students, teammates, administrative
officials and reporters. A small
contingent of the band and the dollies
rounded out the reception committee.
Plunkett was obviously tired from a
long day of handshaking and question

answering. He told reporters that he
had received a congratulatory call from
Joe Theismann, Notre Dame's
sensational quarterback who finished
second in the Heisman Trophy
balloting. Plunkett admitted that he
had not received a call from President
Nixon.
Despite the simplistic and redundent
questions, Plunkett was able to
maintain his sense of humor. When
sports publicist Bob Murphy offered
him a bottle of champaign, coach John
Ralston, who was at Plunkett's side,
reminded his star quarterback of the
training rules. Plunkett replied, "It's a
good thing you weren't on the plane."
Among the most prominent
Plunkett well-wishers was President
Lyman, who rushed to the San
Francisco airport after getting off a
plane in San Jose. When asked to
describe what it meant to have a
Heisman Trophy winner at Stanford,
Lyman replied, "Having a Heisman
Trophy winner at Stanford is one thing,
but having Jim Plunkett is even better.
He's shown great determination as well
as the ability to come back from almost
impossible situations."
Plunkett credited his teammates and
the coaching staff for helping him win
the award.

completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is
now the holder of 11 Pacific-8 passing
and offense records.
The Heisman Trophy will be
presented at a formal dinner Dec. 3 at
the Downtown Athletic Club. Those
who probably will attend from Stanford
include President and Mrs. Richard
Lyman, head football coach John
Ralston and his wife, offensive
back field coach Jack Christiansen and
his wife, athletic director Chuck Taylor
and his wife, Murphy and his wife and
Plunkett and his mother, Mrs. Carmen
Plunkett, or one of his older sisters -

Mary Ann or Genevieve — if Mrs.
Plunkett's health prevents her from
traveling. She has a heart condition.
Heisman ballots are mailed from
selected sportswriters and broadcasters
across the nation. Voting is done on a
3-2-1 basis for first, second and third
places.
Plunkett received 510 first-place

CANDIDATE NO LONGER—Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett fires one of
the many passes t ; 'is season that led the Tribe to the Rose Bowl and enabled him
to break NCAA records for total offense and passing.
"He won by such a margin there was
no question about it," Murphy said.
The Heisman Trophy has been the
object of considerable debate lately
because of the publicity programs
launched by schools who hope to win
it for one of their players.
Stanford's approach has been
lower-keyed than those at Notre Dame
and Mississippi this year. The sports
information department put out a
four-page, black-and-white flyer a
month ago which was devoted to
Plunkett, and followed it with a
two-page 9 by 16 sheet released last
week calling attention to Plunkett, five
other players and Ralston.
An hour after the Heisman
announcement yesterday, word arrived
that Ralston had been selected "Coach
of the Year" by The Sporting News, a
weekly sports publication.
Last night, when Plunkett descended
the escalator into United Airline's
red-carpeted VIP lounge, in San
Francisco he was greeted by nearly 150
students, teammates, administrative
officials and reporters. A small
contingent of the band and the dollies
rounded out the reception committee.
Plunkett was obviously tired from a
long day of handshaking and question

answering. He told reporters that he
had received a congratulatory call from
Joe Theismann, Notre Dame's
sensational quarterback who finished
second in the Heisman Trophy
balloting. Plunkett admitted that he
had not received a call from President
Nixon.
Despite the simplistic and redundent
questions, Plunkett was able to
maintain his sense of humor. When
sports publicist Bob Murphy offered
him a bottle of champaign, coach John
Ralston, who was at Plunkett's side,
reminded his star quarterback of the
training rules. Plunkett replied, "It's a
good thing you weren't on the plane."
Among the most prominent
Plunkett well-wishers was President
Lyman, who rushed to the San
Francisco airport after getting off a
plane in San Jose. When asked to
describe what it meant to have a
Heisman Trophy winner at Stanford,
Lyman replied, "Having a Heisman
Trophy winner at Stanford is one thing,
but having Jim Plunkett is even better.
He's shown great determination as well
as the ability to come back from almost
impossible situations."
Plunkett credited his teammates and
the coaching staff for helping him win
the award.
Sweeping ballots from every region
of the nation, quarterback Jim Plunkett
was voted outstanding football player
of the year yesterday and winner of the
Heisman Trophy.
"I'm in an emotional knot,"
Plunkett told the Athletic Department
via telephone from New York minutes
after the announcement from the
Downtown Athletic Club, which
sponsors the contest.
He was in New York Tuesday
filming an Ail-American television
special with ABC and returned to
campus late last night.
Plunkett received 2229 votes to
1410 for Notre Dame quarterback Joe
Theismann and 849 for Mississippi
quarterback Archie Manning.
"He won in every section in the
country, including the South," said
Bob Murphy, sports information
director.
Plunkett received more than twice as
many first-place votes as Theismann.
Texas running back Steve Worster was
fourth in the voting with 398 votes and
Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern was
fifth with 188.
In his phone call Plunkett said the
award was a reflection on his coaches
and teammates and that he hoped to
share the award with them.

When the announcement came, he
was taping the ABC film with
telecasters Chris Schenkel and Bud
Wilkinson and Ohio State cornerback
Jack Tat urn.
Plunkett's presence in New York at
the time of the announcement was
coincidental, Murphy said. Plunkett
went from the ABC studio to the
Downtown Athletic Club after the
announcement.
"It caught me by surprise," he told
the assembled news media. "I didn't
think it would be announced until the
Dec. 3 dinner."
Plunkett is the first Stanford player
to win what is considered the nation's
most important football award.
"There are some pretty excited
people out here, I'll tell you that,"
Murphy told the Downtown A.C. after
the announcement.
At Stanford, first notice of the
award came on 10 a.m. radio news
Tuesday. "We were promised a call at
9:45 if he had won, and a call at 10 if
he lost," Murphy said. "No call came.
Everybody had his head down around
here."
Coach John Ralston's comment was,
"It's great."
In a written statement Ralston said,
"Jim has performed to our utmost
expectation in all 31 consecutive
games he has started as the Stanford

quarterback. No one could have
contributed more to the success of the
team than he has during this time. He is
certainly deserving of this highest
honor accorded an intercollegiate
football player."
"That may sound a little canned,"
he said, "but that expresses my
opinion."
In his third year the 6-3, 205 -pound
quarterback set new national career
records in total offense and passing,
and led the Indians to their first Rose
Bowl appearance in 19 years.
Plunkett's three year offense total is
7,887 yards, more than 1,000 yards
ahead of the previous record.
This year he has thrown 358 passes,
completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is

questions, Plunkett was able to
maintain his sense of humor. When
sports publicist Bob Murphy offered
him a bottle of champaign, coach John
Ralston, who was at Plunkett's side,
reminded his star quarterback of the
training rules. Plunkett replied, "It's a
good thing you weren't on the plane."
Among the most prominent
Plunkett well-wishers was President
Lyman, who rushed to the San
Francisco airport after getting off a
plane in San Jose. When asked to
describe what it meant to have a
Heisman Trophy winner at Stanford,
Lyman replied, "Having a Heisman
Trophy winner at Stanford is one thing,
but having Jim Plunkett is even better.
He's shown great determination as well
as the ability to come back from almost
impossible situations."
Plunkett credited his teammates and
the coaching staff for helping him win
the award.
Sweeping ballots from every region
of the nation, quarterback Jim Plunkett
was voted outstanding football player
of the year yesterday and winner of the
Heisman Trophy.
"I'm in an emotional knot,"
Plunkett told the Athletic Department
via telephone from New York minutes
after the announcement from the
Downtown Athletic Club, which
sponsors the contest.
He was in New York Tuesday
filming an Ail-American television
special with ABC and returned to
campus late last night.
Plunkett received 2229 votes to
1410 for Notre Dame quarterback Joe
Theismann and 849 for Mississippi
quarterback Archie Manning.
"He won in every section in the
country, including the South," said
Bob Murphy, sports information
director.
Plunkett received more than twice as
many first-place votes as Theismann.
Texas running back Steve Worster was
fourth in the voting with 398 votes and
Ohio State quarterback Rex Kern was
fifth with 188.
In his phone call Plunkett said the
award was a reflection on his coaches
and teammates and that he hoped to
share the award with them.

When the announcement came, he
was taping the ABC film with
telecasters Chris Schenkel and Bud
Wilkinson and Ohio State cornerback
Jack Tat urn.
Plunkett's presence in New York at
the time of the announcement was
coincidental, Murphy said. Plunkett
went from the ABC studio to the
Downtown Athletic Club after the
announcement.
"It caught me by surprise," he told
the assembled news media. "I didn't
think it would be announced until the
Dec. 3 dinner."
Plunkett is the first Stanford player
to win what is considered the nation's
most important football award.
"There are some pretty excited
people out here, I'll tell you that,"
Murphy told the Downtown A.C. after
the announcement.
At Stanford, first notice of the
award came on 10 a.m. radio news
Tuesday. "We were promised a call at
9:45 if he had won, and a call at 10 if
he lost," Murphy said. "No call came.
Everybody had his head down around
here."
Coach John Ralston's comment was,
"It's great."
In a written statement Ralston said,
"Jim has performed to our utmost
expectation in all 31 consecutive
games he has started as the Stanford

quarterback. No one could have
contributed more to the success of the
team than he has during this time. He is
certainly deserving of this highest
honor accorded an intercollegiate
football player."
"That may sound a little canned,"
he said, "but that expresses my
opinion."
In his third year the 6-3, 205 -pound
quarterback set new national career
records in total offense and passing,
and led the Indians to their first Rose
Bowl appearance in 19 years.
Plunkett's three year offense total is
7,887 yards, more than 1,000 yards
ahead of the previous record.
This year he has thrown 358 passes,
completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is
now the holder of 11 Pacific-8 passing
and offense records.
The Heisman Trophy will be
presented at a formal dinner Dec. 3 at
the Downtown Athletic Club. Those
who probably will attend from Stanford
include President and Mrs. Richard
Lyman, head football coach John
Ralston and his wife, offensive
back field coach Jack Christiansen and
his wife, athletic director Chuck Taylor
and his wife, Murphy and his wife and
Plunkett and his mother, Mrs. Carmen
Plunkett, or one of his older sisters -

Mary Ann or Genevieve — if Mrs.
Plunkett's health prevents her from
traveling. She has a heart condition.
Heisman ballots are mailed from
selected sportswriters and broadcasters
across the nation. Voting is done on a
3-2-1 basis for first, second and third
places.
Plunkett received 510 first-place
votes, 285 seconds and 129 thirds.
Theismann got 2 4 2 first place votes and
Manning 1 38.
Others in the voting were Pat
Sullivan, Auburn quarterback, sixth;
Tatum, seventh; Ernie Jennings, Air
Force flanker, eighth; Don McCauley,
North Carolina running back, ninth;
and Lynn Dickey, Kansas State
quarterback, 10 th.

CANDIDATE NO LONGER—Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett fires one of
the many passes t ; 'is season that led the Tribe to the Rose Bowl and enabled him
to break NCAA records for total offense and passing.
"He won by such a margin there was
no question about it," Murphy said.
The Heisman Trophy has been the
object of considerable debate lately
because of the publicity programs
launched by schools who hope to win
it for one of their players.
Stanford's approach has been
lower-keyed than those at Notre Dame
and Mississippi this year. The sports
information department put out a
four-page, black-and-white flyer a
month ago which was devoted to
Plunkett, and followed it with a
two-page 9 by 16 sheet released last
week calling attention to Plunkett, five
other players and Ralston.
An hour after the Heisman
announcement yesterday, word arrived
that Ralston had been selected "Coach
of the Year" by The Sporting News, a
weekly sports publication.
Last night, when Plunkett descended
the escalator into United Airline's
red-carpeted VIP lounge, in San
Francisco he was greeted by nearly 150
students, teammates, administrative
officials and reporters. A small
contingent of the band and the dollies
rounded out the reception committee.
Plunkett was obviously tired from a
long day of handshaking and question

answering. He told reporters that he
had received a congratulatory call from
Joe Theismann, Notre Dame's
sensational quarterback who finished
second in the Heisman Trophy
balloting. Plunkett admitted that he
had not received a call from President
Nixon.
Despite the simplistic and redundent

In a written statement Ralston said,
"Jim has performed to our utmost
expectation in all 31 consecutive
games he has started as the Stanford

quarterback. No one could have
contributed more to the success of the
team than he has during this time. He is
certainly deserving of this highest
honor accorded an intercollegiate
football player."
"That may sound a little canned,"
he said, "but that expresses my
opinion."
In his third year the 6-3, 205 -pound
quarterback set new national career
records in total offense and passing,
and led the Indians to their first Rose
Bowl appearance in 19 years.
Plunkett's three year offense total is
7,887 yards, more than 1,000 yards
ahead of the previous record.
This year he has thrown 358 passes,
completed 191 for 2,715 yards and 18
touchdowns. His 1 970 total offense is
2,898 yards. The senior quarterback is
now the holder of 11 Pacific-8 passing
and offense records.
The Heisman Trophy will be
presented at a formal dinner Dec. 3 at
the Downtown Athletic Club. Those
who probably will attend from Stanford
include President and Mrs. Richard
Lyman, head football coach John
Ralston and his wife, offensive
back field coach Jack Christiansen and
his wife, athletic director Chuck Taylor
and his wife, Murphy and his wife and
Plunkett and his mother, Mrs. Carmen
Plunkett, or one of his older sisters -

Mary Ann or Genevieve — if Mrs.
Plunkett's health prevents her from
traveling. She has a heart condition.
Heisman ballots are mailed from
selected sportswriters and broadcasters
across the nation. Voting is done on a
3-2-1 basis for first, second and third
places.
Plunkett received 510 first-place
votes, 285 seconds and 129 thirds.
Theismann got 2 4 2 first place votes and
Manning 1 38.
Others in the voting were Pat
Sullivan, Auburn quarterback, sixth;
Tatum, seventh; Ernie Jennings, Air
Force flanker, eighth; Don McCauley,
North Carolina running back, ninth;
and Lynn Dickey, Kansas State
quarterback, 10 th.

CANDIDATE NO LONGER—Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plunkett fires one of
the many passes t ; 'is season that led the Tribe to the Rose Bowl and enabled him
to break NCAA records for total offense and passing.
"He won by such a margin there was
no question about it," Murphy said.
The Heisman Trophy has been the
object of considerable debate lately
because of the publicity programs
launched by schools who hope to win
it for one of their players.
Stanford's approach has been
lower-keyed than those at Notre Dame
and Mississippi this year. The sports
information department put out a
four-page, black-and-white flyer a
month ago which was devoted to
Plunkett, and followed it with a
two-page 9 by 16 sheet released last
week calling attention to Plunkett, five
other players and Ralston.
An hour after the Heisman
announcement yesterday, word arrived
that Ralston had been selected "Coach
of the Year" by The Sporting News, a
weekly sports publication.
Last night, when Plunkett descended
the escalator into United Airline's
red-carpeted VIP lounge, in San
Francisco he was greeted by nearly 150
students, teammates, administrative
officials and reporters. A small
contingent of the band and the dollies
rounded out the reception committee.
Plunkett was obviously tired from a
long day of handshaking and question

answering. He told reporters that he
had received a congratulatory call from
Joe Theismann, Notre Dame's
sensational quarterback who finished
second in the Heisman Trophy
balloting. Plunkett admitted that he
had not received a call from President
Nixon.
Despite the simplistic and redundent
questions, Plunkett was able to
maintain his sense of humor. When
sports publicist Bob Murphy offered
him a bottle of champaign, coach John
Ralston, who was at Plunkett's side,
reminded his star quarterback of the
training rules. Plunkett replied, "It's a
good thing you weren't on the plane."
Among the most prominent
Plunkett well-wishers was President
Lyman, who rushed to the San
Francisco airport after getting off a
plane in San Jose. When asked to
describe what it meant to have a
Heisman Trophy winner at Stanford,
Lyman replied, "Having a Heisman
Trophy winner at Stanford is one thing,
but having Jim Plunkett is even better.
He's shown great determination as well
as the ability to come back from almost
impossible situations."
Plunkett credited his teammates and
the coaching staff for helping him win
the award.
