# Poloists Make Finals
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's water poloists will
head south toward Long Beach
Thursday to play in the final
elimination tournament for the
NCAA Water Polo
Championships. Seven of the eight
teams in the tournament are from
California. Oniy Colorado decided
to enter as its regional champion.
UCLA, defending champs, will
open the tourney against UC
Santa Barbara. In the second
upper bracket contest, Stanford
meets San Jose State.
In the bottom bracket, Long
Beach State challenges Colorado.
In the final first round elimination
contest, USC meets UC Irvine.
UCLA has to be touted as the
favorite with the USC Trojans and
the Irvine Anteaters a likely
runner-up. Stanford, SJ State, and
Long Beach State are the
dark-horses.
Coach Jim Caughran is hoping
that the Indians will get to meet
the Bruins in the second round.
"It's possible that they might
just be looking right past us and

thinking of the finals. But we
need to win the opener or the best
we can get is fifth," Gaughran
explained.
Offensively, the Indians will go
with captain Rick Massimino in
the hole. Massimino has scored 5 9
goals this season and holds a
better than 5 2% scoring rate.
Mike Davis has tossed in 38
tallies at a 4 0% clip. Bill Simpkins
has 35 goals to his credit and
scores on over half his shots.
Other scorers in double figures
and Rob Woolley with 19, Bob
Warren with 13, and Ray Collins
and Rob Jensen with 1 2 apiece.

Massimino and Collins lead in
assists with 16 each. Davis has
assisted ten times and Simpkins
nine.
On defense, goalie Fete Gadd
has played excellently. His goal
saving percentage is nearly seven
stops out of every ten shots. His
spectacular saves on penalty shots
have lifted the Cardinals several
times to victory.
The Indians have played the
Spartans from San Jose twice this
year, splitting the series. The
Cards took the final game last
week. Against UCLA, the Indians
have yet to register a victory.
