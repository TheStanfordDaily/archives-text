# Basketball Returns; Center Is Problem
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Featuring a unique three
forward offense, Stanford's
basketball team will make its
debut Tuesday against the
University of San Francisco. 6-10
center Larry Rosenzweig has been
sidelined for at least six more
weeks with a knee operation and
his backup man, 6-6 Brad Lind, is
slowed by a bad ankle.
Still Coach Howie Dallmar
feels that the rest of his squad's
talent and depth will make the
Indians tough to handle. "We have
big guards, good depth and good
shooters. Our perimeter shooting
will be excellent," Coach Dallmar
said.
That depth will come mainly
from last year's freshman team.
Behind 6-5 junior Claude Terry
and 6-2 senior Dennis O'Neill,
both stellar backcourt performers
and leading scorers last season,
will be three sophomores: 6-3 1/2
Pat Rusco, 6-2 John Stratton,and
5-8 1/2 Gary Cain.
The same depth will support
the front line. Returning senior
lettermen include 6-4 Chuck
Moore, 6-6 Michel, and 6-4 Fred

Green. Backing up the veterans
will be two sophomores: 6-4 Bob
Buell and 6-4 Pat Stevens.
"We have good sophomores
and they'll play. The good depth
in the front line and the guards is
there with the sophomores. The
trouble is inside at center. We'll go
with three forwards and two
guards a lot of the tine," Dallmar
said.
"Our main defensive concern
will be on the big guy. Any club
would like to control the ball 60%
of the time. So we're thinking in
terms of percentage shooting,"
Dallmar said.
Rosenzweig and Lind are only
two of a number of injured
players. Buell and Stevens also
have suffered ankle sprains. In the
early season, the Cards front line
will definitely be in trouble and
unless Rosenzweig can return at
full speed, the problem may last
all year.
"If Larry returns, it'll be a
bonus," Dallmar confided. "We'll
have a big test in December with a
good intersectional schedule.
We're going to face some big
men," Dallmar concluded.
