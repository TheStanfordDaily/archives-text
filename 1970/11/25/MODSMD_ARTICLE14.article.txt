# Kardong Third In Nationals
## 
### 
Running on a fast, flat course
in Virginia, senior cross country
ace Don Kardong galloped to a
third-place finish in the NCAA
cross country championships
Monday at William and Mary
College.
Oregon's Steve Prefontaine
won the six-mile race in a record
28 :00 .2 time.
Villanova's Don Walsh was
second in 28:08, two seconds
ahead of Kardong's 28:10 time.
Prefontaine won by about 5 0
yards.
Kardong, Walsh, Prefontaine
and roughly 65 others runners
snapped the old NCAA record of
29:40 which was run on a far
tougher course than this year's
race.
Kardong's finish in the top 20
earns him All-America honors in

cross country. He earned
All-America recognition last year
in the NCAA three-mile
competition in track.
His third-place finish was the
highest ever for a Stanford runner.
Last year Creg Brock went to the
national race and finished ninth.
"I thought he would probably
make the first 10," said Coach
Marshall Clark, "but I guess I
didn't expect him to do as well as
third. I think he did, though."
"It was an awfully good race,"
Clark said. Prefontaine ran off to
a blitzing 4:19 first mile, which
left much of the field of 32 3
struggling to catch up. Kardong,
who ran a 4:31 first mile, was
roughly 60th at that point, Clark
said. "It was an extremely fast
pace."
"Don didn't go out real hard.

He was fortunate he could get
through," Clark said, as much of
the race was run on a dirt road
and 32 3 runners made for heavy
traffic.
Arvid Kretz also ran for
Stanford but finished over 100,
Clark said.
Villanova has apparently been
declared the national winner after
a mix-up at the finish chutes led
to wide-spread confusion at the
end.
Three finish chutes were set
up, and everything went fine
while the leaders finished. But
when the bulk of the runners
came across some got funneled
into the wrong one, and early
compilations placed Oregon and
Villanova in a tie for the title.
"Everything had been perfect
until then," Clark said.
