Laird Defends Raid
WASHINGTON - Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird said Tuesday night the
United States has shown North
Vietnam "we do have the capability"
to rescue the Americans they hold
prisoner and warned of strong
counter-measures should the
Communists retaliate against their
captives for the U.S. raid on a POW
compound.
said that raid, which rescued
no one, was a signal to Hanoi "that we
care about these men, and that we will
take rather unusual means to see that
these men are returned as free
Americans."
Vice President Spiro Agnew said
Tuesday that despite the failure of last
week's raid to rescue American
prisoners of war, more such attempts
will be made when possible.
"I think we can't afford to give up
on our POWs," Agnew told newsmen.
"We've got to continue to extricate
them whenever we can.
"It was a very courageous
undertaking, and we're sorry it wasn't
successful."
Draft Ruling Made
WASHINGTON - The Selective
Service System said today a man in this
year's draft pool may drop his
deferment anytime up to midnight Dec.
31 and be considered 1-A for all of
1 970.
He just has to make sure his
application to his draft board is
postmarked before that deadline.
Thus, a deferred man holding a high
number from the draft lottery of last
December can wait until he is sure his
number is really safe even after his
draft board has held its last meeting of
the year and then place himself in the
1 970 draft pool.

That brief exposure would officially
serve as his year of "prime" exposure
to the draft and in his new 1-A status
he would slip into a less vulnerable
category on Jan. 1,1971.
The process would have that effect
provided the application is submitted
on time, even if the man's local draft
board does not formally reclassify him
until sometime in 1971.
Price Hike
SAN FRANCISCO - The San
Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco
Examiner Tuesday announced 5-cent
increases in their street sale prices
effective next Monday.
The papers said in separate
announcements the increase trom 1 0 to
15 cents will be the lirst hike in news
stand prices in 18 years. They cited
increased production and distribution
costs.
Kent Allegation
CLEVELAND - The Justice
Department is removing from its
summary on the shooting of students at
Kent State University May 4 an

allegation that Ohio National
Guardsmen fabricated a story that their
lives were in danger, a state prosecutor
testified Tuesday.
State Prosecutor Robert L. Balyeat,
who conducted a special state grand
"jury probe of the incident in which
four students were killed and nine
wounded as Guardsmen and students
clashed on the campus, told a federal
court that the conclusion in the
summary was based on a newspaper
report, and when FBI agents later tried
to find the Guardsman who had talked
to newsmen, they were unsuccessful.
Guinea Victory
MONROVIA, Liberia â€” Guinea claimed
Tuesday its forces beat off "many
incursions" by Portuguese and
mercenaries who landed on the coast
during the night.
While a broadcast gave no indication
of whether fighting was still in progress,
Guinea's ambassador to Nigeria said life
in the country had returned to normal
after this second invasion attempt.
Travelers from Guinea said earlier
that the invasion that began Saturday
night appeared to be over.
