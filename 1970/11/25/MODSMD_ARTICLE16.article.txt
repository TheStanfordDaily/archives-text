# Union Dispute Referred To D.C.
## 
### PHIL LIND 
After two months of testimony by
five labor organizing groups on campus
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has referred the controversial
question of campus unionization to
the national office in Washington D.C.
The decision was announced Friday
by hearing officer Douglas Barton in
San Francisco who said that as ot
Monday the case would be forwarded
to Washington.
The basic issue concerns which
bargaining unit of University workers
will be granted recognition. Eventually
the University staff that is to be
included in the unit will vote for the
labor group they wish to represent their
interests.
Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) has proposed a unit of technical,
maintenance and service workers,
excluding clerical workers.
The Teamsters Union proposes to
represent only the workers at the
Physical Plant, believing they can
eventually expand to the rest of the
Uniersity.
United Electrical Workers (UE) nave
asked the NLRB to recognize
University electrical workers whom
they hope can be united with workers
in the Industrial Park.
Workers Action Caucus (WAC)
supports the efforts of women and
minority race members to organize,
while being strongly opposed to the
SEA plan which excludes women from
organizing.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has petitioned for the largest bargaining
unit which includes all campus
employees regardless of their positions.
The Board decided on Dec. 11 as the
deadline for labor groups to submit
briefs summarizing their positions after
which the new information along with
the existing evidence would be shipped
to Washington.
Following last summer's labor board
ruling that a private university can
come under the jurisdiction of the

National Labor Relations Act, labor
groups here were the first among
private university representatives to
petition the NLRB. Consequently
whatever decision comes out of the
Stanford decision may set a precedent
for other private universities.
Roland Finston, a member of USE,
says his organization is not surprised at
the decision to refer the case to
Washington. "Since Stanford
unionizing will set such a precedent for
other universities, we expected the
NLRB to refer the decision to

Washington. It's a bigger decision than
it appears to be."
According to Robert Nelson,
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, the University's position
toward labor organizing it remains the
same as a month ago.
The policy stated that: "employees
may solicit union membership during
free period - before work, during breaks
and meal periods, and after work. It is
not permissible to engage in organizing
activities in work areas during work
periods, or to interfere with work being
performed by others."

for other private universities.
Roland Finston, a member of USE,
says his organization is not surprised at
the decision to refer the case to
Washington. "Since Stanford
unionizing will set such a precedent for
other universities, we expected the
NLRB to refer the decision to

Washington. It's a bigger decision than
it appears to be."
According to Robert Nelson,
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, the University's position
toward labor organizing it remains the
same as a month ago.
The policy stated that: "employees
may solicit union membership during
free period - before work, during breaks
and meal periods, and after work. It is
not permissible to engage in organizing
activities in work areas during work
periods, or to interfere with work being
performed by others."
After two months of testimony by
five labor organizing groups on campus
the National Labor Relations Board
(NLRB) has referred the controversial
question of campus unionization to
the national office in Washington D.C.
The decision was announced Friday
by hearing officer Douglas Barton in
San Francisco who said that as ot
Monday the case would be forwarded
to Washington.
The basic issue concerns which
bargaining unit of University workers
will be granted recognition. Eventually
the University staff that is to be
included in the unit will vote for the
labor group they wish to represent their
interests.
Stanford Employees Association
(SEA) has proposed a unit of technical,
maintenance and service workers,
excluding clerical workers.
The Teamsters Union proposes to
represent only the workers at the
Physical Plant, believing they can
eventually expand to the rest of the
Uniersity.
United Electrical Workers (UE) nave
asked the NLRB to recognize
University electrical workers whom
they hope can be united with workers
in the Industrial Park.
Workers Action Caucus (WAC)
supports the efforts of women and
minority race members to organize,
while being strongly opposed to the
SEA plan which excludes women from
organizing.
United Stanford Employees (USE)
has petitioned for the largest bargaining
unit which includes all campus
employees regardless of their positions.
The Board decided on Dec. 11 as the
deadline for labor groups to submit
briefs summarizing their positions after
which the new information along with
the existing evidence would be shipped
to Washington.
Following last summer's labor board
ruling that a private university can
come under the jurisdiction of the

National Labor Relations Act, labor
groups here were the first among
private university representatives to
petition the NLRB. Consequently
whatever decision comes out of the
Stanford decision may set a precedent
for other private universities.
