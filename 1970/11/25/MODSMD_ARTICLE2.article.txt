# Radicals Plan Future Tactics; Eject Schwartz From Meeting
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT BOB LITTERMAN 
John Schwartz, Presidential
Assistant for Discipline, was forcibly
ejected last night from a radical
meeting which debated future tactics
and aired splits among radical groups.
Schwartz was pushed from the
Roble dining hall early in the meeting.
Asked if he wished to leave, Schwartz
shook his head "no." He was called a
"pig" and "jerk" and told he was
"inciting a riot" by refusing to go.
Lights in the room were turned off
and curtains were held closed as
Schwartz was ejected. He said he was
"forcibly pushed out" but was not hit
or injured.
Schwartz later said campus facilities
should be denied to any group which
"selectively excludes" people from
otherwise open meetings.
The rest of the meeting discussed
radical tactics to follow Monday night's
trashing.Damage of over $3,000 was
caused when 9 0 windows were broken
by a portion of the crowd after a
meeting protesting this weekend's U.S.
bombings in North Vietnam.
Most speakers last night supported
the tactic of trashing, but some said
Monday's attack had not followed
sufficient community organizing or an
agreement by a mass meeting.
Lenny Siegel of the New Left

Project commented, "I don't likegoing
to a meeting to decide what to do when
there are a lot of people who came just
to trash."
"What happened could be successful
if some people developed some research
on why these buildings are attacked."
Bill Evers of the same group said the
trashing by off-campus people
including high schoolers, "makes it
difficult in building a movement here."
On the other hand English Professor
Bruce Franklin of the Radical Caucus
said many students were not aware of
the bombing of North Vietnam until
"trashing went on last night."
Differences between New Left
Project and Radical Caucus also
surfaced during plans for (a) Monday
night anti-war convocation and for
protests against next Tuesday's San
Francisco visit by South Vietnam's
Vice-president Ky.
The crowd of about 15 0 agreed to
participate in an anti-war convocation
Monday night at Memorial Church.
Then, New Left Project and RAdical
Caucus members each suggested their
own members as convocation speakers.
When a Revolutionary Union member
who had visited Cuba was suggested, a
New Left Project member immediately
countered with one of his group's
supporters who was on the same
"Venceremos Brigade."
In spite of the tensions, speakers

seemed optimistic about plans to
generate a mass movement on campus.

participate in the Monday night
convocation and in emphasizing

The picketers protested peacefully
against the bombing of North Vietnam
and SRI counterinsurgency research.
Carrying signs such as "Stop the
Bombing" and "Bomb SRI, Not
People," they marched on the front
sidewalk for 40 minutes.
Main speaker at the noon rally was
Harry Cleaver, an economics graduate
student who served on the 19 68
committee which investigated
University-SRI relations. Cleaver
charged that SRI has continued to
conduct counter-insurgency research
including projects dealing with radio
communications in jungle areas and
special electronic warfare devices.
Another speaker, Willy Newberry,
presented the Black Student Union's
opposition to the "rightist, imperialist
invasion of Guinea." He said the BSU is
"considering appropriate action against
this intrusion," and will meet at 11 :15
this morning at San Francisco's Federal
Building.

White Plaza.
The picketers protested peacefully
against the bombing of North Vietnam
and SRI counterinsurgency research.
Carrying signs such as "Stop the
Bombing" and "Bomb SRI, Not
People," they marched on the front
sidewalk for 40 minutes.
Main speaker at the noon rally was
Harry Cleaver, an economics graduate
student who served on the 19 68
committee which investigated
University-SRI relations. Cleaver
charged that SRI has continued to
conduct counter-insurgency research
including projects dealing with radio
communications in jungle areas and
special electronic warfare devices.
Another speaker, Willy Newberry,
presented the Black Student Union's
opposition to the "rightist, imperialist
invasion of Guinea." He said the BSU is
"considering appropriate action against
this intrusion," and will meet at 11 :15
this morning at San Francisco's Federal
Building.
John Schwartz, Presidential
Assistant for Discipline, was forcibly
ejected last night from a radical
meeting which debated future tactics
and aired splits among radical groups.
Schwartz was pushed from the
Roble dining hall early in the meeting.
Asked if he wished to leave, Schwartz
shook his head "no." He was called a
"pig" and "jerk" and told he was
"inciting a riot" by refusing to go.
Lights in the room were turned off
and curtains were held closed as
Schwartz was ejected. He said he was
"forcibly pushed out" but was not hit
or injured.
Schwartz later said campus facilities
should be denied to any group which
"selectively excludes" people from
otherwise open meetings.
The rest of the meeting discussed
radical tactics to follow Monday night's
trashing.Damage of over $3,000 was
caused when 9 0 windows were broken
by a portion of the crowd after a
meeting protesting this weekend's U.S.
bombings in North Vietnam.
Most speakers last night supported
the tactic of trashing, but some said
Monday's attack had not followed
sufficient community organizing or an
agreement by a mass meeting.
Lenny Siegel of the New Left

Project commented, "I don't likegoing
to a meeting to decide what to do when
there are a lot of people who came just
to trash."
"What happened could be successful
if some people developed some research
on why these buildings are attacked."
Bill Evers of the same group said the
trashing by off-campus people
including high schoolers, "makes it
difficult in building a movement here."
On the other hand English Professor
Bruce Franklin of the Radical Caucus
said many students were not aware of
the bombing of North Vietnam until
"trashing went on last night."
Differences between New Left
Project and Radical Caucus also
surfaced during plans for (a) Monday
night anti-war convocation and for
protests against next Tuesday's San
Francisco visit by South Vietnam's
Vice-president Ky.
The crowd of about 15 0 agreed to
participate in an anti-war convocation
Monday night at Memorial Church.
Then, New Left Project and RAdical
Caucus members each suggested their
own members as convocation speakers.
When a Revolutionary Union member
who had visited Cuba was suggested, a
New Left Project member immediately
countered with one of his group's
supporters who was on the same
"Venceremos Brigade."
In spite of the tensions, speakers

seemed optimistic about plans to
generate a mass movement on campus.
They were united in planning to
participate in the Monday night
convocation and in emphasizing
Tuesday's anti-Ky rally.
