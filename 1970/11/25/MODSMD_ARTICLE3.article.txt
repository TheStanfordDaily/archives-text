## Will Vietnamization Work? 
### PHIL LIND 
After a four month review of the
Vietnam War, President Nixon
announced his Vietnamization program
in late May of 1 969. His plan was to
diminish the responsibilities of the
United States and increase the combat
load of the South Vietnamese army.
As fighting has fallen off and
casualties have dropped over the past
several months, the Administration has
pointed proudly to this policy. But
according to one Asian expert, it is too
early to judge the policy a success.
Political Science Professor John
Lewis, explains that Vietnamization
consists of three major points:
1) to transfer the bulk of the
fighting to the South Vietnamese army;
2) to pacify the population of the
countryside;
3) to gradually increase the
authority of the Saigon government
and popular respect for it.
"The build-up of the South
Vietnamese army and the transfer of
burden has been successful thus far.
Unfortunately, it also means that while
diminishing the ground support we
provide for the war we are forced to
increase our air support and a great
financial burden arises," Lewis said.
Move To Countryside
According to Lewis, the idea behind
pacifying the countryside is to allow
the people that have been forced into
the cities to move back to their homes.
"Also playing in this political game is
the NLF, which is very receptive to this
idea of allowing the people to move
back where they want to be."
At the same time the U.S.
announced the Nixon strategy for
winning a political victory in Vietnam,
the North Vietnamese seemed to
change their tactics. Attacks on the
countryside by the NLF and Hanoi
armies diminished. "Nixon is trying to
claim that this is due to his program.
But this is simply untrue. The North
Vietnamese anticipated the move and

simply called for a hold back at the
same time."
There has been a great deal of
controversy over the difference
between the theoretical and actual
results of Vietnamization.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the
Hoover Institute feels that
Vietnamization is becoming a complete
success. "I think the President's plan is
moving according to schedule and has
every appearance of being successful.
The recent attack on North Vietnam
was a necessary step in establishing a
negotiated peace, just as the
Cambodian incursion was."
According to Campbell, the recent
bombings of the North are not an
indication of the failure of the
program, but simply a warning to the
North, just as many statesmen have
said. "I think the President has more
information available to him than we
think he does, and we should have faith
that he is working toward a just peace
and successful Vietnamization
program," Campbell said.
Lewis feels that one of the major
results of Vietnamization is the social
chaos within the large cities, Saigon in
particular. "The only way that many of
the people in the cities can stay alive is
to become prostitutes, petty thieves,
and other unfortunate occupations.

Inflation is rising at an unbelievable
rate of 10 per cent a month, and the
entire economy in the cities is faltering.
There are a great many anti-war, peace
movements arising in the cities. As a
result, the amount of repression is
incredible. Saigon is in a chaotic
period."
The North Vietnamese are winning
very soundly on the political front
according to Lewis. "The Viet Cong
have been able to infiltrate about
30,000 people a month into the Saigon
area, and are expected to raise that to a
rate of 50,000 a month. This is only
the civilian picture. You can imagine
the rate in the army."
The South Vietnamese don't seem
to want to fight the war any more than
the Nixon Administration says they
want the U.S. to fight it."The men in
the South Vietnamese army are
defecting at an enormous rate. The
military is being infiltrated, and the
NLF people are presenting an
alternative to the depressed ARVN."
Lewis said.
What upsets Lewis most is the fact
that the government has not reported a
great deal of what's really happening.
"There has been no report on accurate
infiltration rates, death count rates, and
certainly nothing about the repression
