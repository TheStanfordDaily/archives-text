# Gobblers Glorified For Greedy Gourmets' Gustation

1 wish the Ixild eagle had not been chosen as the
representative of our country; he is a bird of bad moral
character; like those among men who live by sharping and
robbing, he is generally poor, and often very lousy.
The turkey is a much more respectable bird . . .
Benjamin Franklin
Ben Franklin liked turkeys. Most of us like turkeys too,
which is why we eat them on Thanksgiving and why some
of us even are turkeys.
But like Thanksgiving, the turkey industry in this
country has really changed. It used to be that around
Thanksgiving you would just go out in the back yard with a
few Indians you had over for dinner and shoot yourself a
few turkeys with your blunderbuss.
Today if you went out in your backyard with a gun you
would either be arrested or some nut would shoot you first.
At any rate, it's probably best to buy your turkeys in the
store.
Yet once inside the store you realize that the
Thanksgiving turkey industry is not only limited to birds.
Rather it has spread its wings in other directions, say for
instance, the stuffing industry. There's Kellogg's stuffing,
Bell's stuffing, Betty Crocker's stuffing, not to mention
Mrs. Cubbison's Ready-to-lJse melba toast stuffing and Mrs.
Cubbison's Ready-to-lJse melba toasted eornbread stuffing.
(Jood heavens, what will Mrs. Cubbison think of next?
While I was standing in the All-Arabian market looking
at the turkey freezer and trying to figure out the best way
to steal one (my first idea of hiding it between the credit
cards in my wallet proved unfeasible), a man approached
me and asked, "Iley kid, do you know anything about
turkeys?"
I was about to say, "Yes, and you're one, you turkey,"
but considering his size and inv running ability, I soon

abandoned this birdbrain idea figuring that even though I
was chicken, my goose would be cooked, and I eould end
up a dead duck.
Anyhow, informing the man, who was either on
something or had serious emotional problems, that I knew
nothing of turkeys, embarrassed by ignorance, I
immediately ran back to UGLY and pulled out what
appears to be the definitive book on turkeys, AAV.
Shorger's monumental work. The Wild Turkey.
Shorger, by the way, is none other than the same AAV.
Shorger who brought you those exciting works you loved
so dearly, The Passenger Pigeon and The Chemistry of
Cellulose and Wood.
After having read five hundred page book on turkeys,
you will probably be pretty mad at yourself for having
wasted so much time in such a stupid way. However, you
will be able to amaze your parents and relatives this
Thanksgiving by referring to the turkey by its scientific
name.
Perhaps you cane come up with a line like, "Iley dad,
could you pass me some more Meleagris gallapavo of the
superfamilia Meleagrididae?"
Once you have wiped the mashed potatoes and
cranberry sauce from your face, some of the relatives at the
table may apologize for having thrown food at you.
Actually, you may have fooled everyone at the table into
believing that you've actually learned something at
Stanford.
Anyhow, to gel the real lowdown on turkeys, 1 decided
to call Ike's turkey farm (no relation to the former
president), and spoke with the head turkey, Herman, asking
him how he was going to celebrate Thanksgiving.
Herman informed me that in the past they had usually
had a feast on Pilgrims.
1 said that this seemed pretty incredible, to which
Herman replied, "Have you seen many Pilgrims recently?*'
