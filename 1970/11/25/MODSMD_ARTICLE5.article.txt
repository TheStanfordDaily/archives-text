### 
This statement supersedes all
previous statements on the subject of
Academic Standing of
Undergraduates.
All undergraduate students are
expected to make normal progress
toward completing 180 units in four
years (12 quarters). The procedures
described below are designed to
identify students who are not making
minimal progress in order that they
can obtain the assistance of their
academic advisers and other members
of the staff as quickly as possible.
Units are granted for courses
completed with grades of "A," "B,"
"C," and "L." Courses graded
"N" are counted provisionally as
units completed, provided that the
student enrolls in the continuing
segment of that course the following
quarter. When the course is
completed, the student receives the
units for which he enrolled. No units
are granted for courses in which the
student receives an "I" or an
until the course is completed. All
academic quarters (except for a
Summer Quarter's registration of 11
units or fewer) in which the student
is registered shall be counted as a
quarter of enrollment for the purpose
of academic standing unless the
Committee acting upon a petition for
fewer than 12 units stipulates
otherwise.
PROBATION
A student who fails to complete at
least 36 units of work in his or her
most recent three quarters of
enrollment at the University or a

[Space for this article paid for by the University]

student who fails to complete at least
nine quarter units of work in his or
her most recent quarter of
enrollment at the University shall be
placed on probation (a warning
status) unless the Committee in its
quarterly review of individual
academic records decides not to place
the student on probation.
A student shall be removed from
probation when he or she has
completed at least 36 units of work
in his or her most recent three
quarters of enrollment at the
University or at the discretion of the
Committee as a result of a review of
individual records.
PROVISIONAL REGULATIONS
Students on probation who fail to
complete a minimum of 12 units of
credit in any quarter of registration
shall lose their registration privilege
unless they apply for and receive the
status of provisional registration on
petition to the Committee. If
provisional registration is granted, it
will be accompanied by a clear and
precise statement of the conditions
under which it is given. In making its
determination as to whether to grant
the provisional registration, the
Committee shall consider the written
petition of the student, and, unless
impossible or inappropriate, the
statement of the student's academic
adviser and the statement of a
member of the University Counseling
staff.
SUSPENSION
Students who are not granted
provisional registration by the

Committse or are eligible to apply
for provisional registration and do
not do so, or who fail to fulfill the
provisions of their provisional
registration shall be placed on
academic suspension.
Students on suspension for the
first time may apply by petition for
provisional registration to return to
the University. Provisional
registration will normally be granted,
at the earliest, for the academic
quarter which begins at least eleven
months after the date of suspension.
Students who have returned to the
University after having been on
academic suspension and are again
placed on suspension may apply by
petition for provisional registration
to return to the University.
Provisional registration will normally
be granted, at the earliest, for the
academic quarter which begins at
least 35 months after the date of
suspension.
NOTIFICATION
Written notices that students are
on probation or suspension or that
they have been granted provisional
registration shall be sent to the
student and to the student's
academic adviser as soon as practical
after the close of the academic
quarter in question. Copies of all
notices shall be sent to the student's
parents or guardians if the student is
unmarried and under 21 years of age.
Any questions concerning
academic standing or the petitioning
process should be referred to the
Academic Standing Secretary, Room
145 on the first floor of the Old
Union, 321-2300, Extension 2049.
