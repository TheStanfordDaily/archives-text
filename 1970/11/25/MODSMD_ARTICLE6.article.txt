## Manipulation & Obliteration 
### 
The "waves of U.S. planes" ranging "deep into
North Vietnam" are an ominous harbinger of
Nixon's future military moves in Indochina. What
that future might bring may well be presented in
the November 15 New York Times by chief
foreign correspondent, C.L. Sulzberger. He argued
that "Limited commitments to conventional
defense are seen as increasingly outmoded, and yet
total warfare is a dreadful
absurdity .. . Consequently, the search focuses on
a third solution - between impossible nuclear
disaster and unsuccessful conventional warfare.
The answer may well lie in the field of truly
tactical atomic weapons."
Nixon and his chief foreign policy advisor,
Henry Kissinger, know that they cannot achieve a
military victory through conventional warfare.
Once they have committed themselves to
withdrawing troops, they know they can achieve
victory only through a political settlement. And
they have a definite strategy to "win" through a
political settlement. But a necessary part of that
strategy is to militarily weaken the NLF by isolating
them from North Vietnamese support. This side of
their strategy they are pursuing may force them to
a further, possibly nuclear, escalation.
Bombings Fail
The massive conventional bombings against the
trail have failed to stop "infiltration." Atomic land
mines or other tactical nuclear weapons, by
contaminating the Trail, could form a relatively
permanent radioactive barrier between North and
South Vietnam. (This sort of weapon would not
be directed at civilian populations.) Aware of
the impossibility of a military victory Nixon's
strategy is to establish a position of military
strength from which negotiate a favorable political
settlement. Since the "Vietnamization" of the war
seems to be a failure on military grounds, the
severance of the supply lines could be his hope for
a trump. A pressing concern is the fact that, as
Henry Kissinger wrote, "Unfortunately, our
military strength has no political corollary; we
have been unable so far to create a political
structure that could survive military opposition
from Hanoi after we withdraw."
More Escalations
Although the military escalations and Nixon's
promises for a "peace that would deter future
warmakers" have portended of more massive
escalations, the main problem Nixon has to deal
with is creation in South Vietnam of the
"political structure that could survive..." It
seems that Nixon is hoping to achieve a political
settlement close to that advocated by the
establishment "Doves," and Nixon's military
operations are directed toward making his political
settlement work in American favor.
Nixon has had to pressure Thieu and Ky to
allow open political opposition to their regime and
to the U.S. military presence so that the peace
forces can organize themselves as a strong
non-communist alternative to the NLF. Two years
ago this plan was suggested by Kissingers's
colleague at Harvard, Samuel P. Huntington,
Chairman of the Department of Government.
Huntington pointed out that the U.S. has been
upstaging Maoist guerilla war by 'urbanizing
through massive bombing and artillery in South
Vietnam and thus taking the society out of the
stage where it is susceptible to rural revolution.
Even though the U.S. has 'urbanized' South
Vietnam (with the hope of destroying the NLF
infrastructure among the surviving population),
Huntington argues, there will still be strong
opposition to the Saigon government in the cities.
In his paper for the Southeast Asia Development
Advisory Group, entitled "Getting Ready for
Political Competition in South Vietnam,"
Huntington proposes that the U.S. must organize
the urban opposition to the Saigon regime before
the NLF does.
He suggested that the U.S. back General Duong
Van Minh ("Big Minh") and the Buddhists, among
others. And recently Minh has emerged in Saigon
as the leading candidate for the 1971 presidential
elections, backed by a unprecedented alliance of
opposition groups. His candidacy has been greeted

banning garrett

by the NLF, who feel they could negotiate a
settlement if Big Minh were in power in Saigon.
Nixon's Hope
Kissinger warned in January 1969 that U.S.
involvement in an attempt to "impose a coalition
government" on South Vietnam "may well
destroy the existing political structure of South
Viet Nam and thus lead to a communist takeover.
But Nixon may hope that Big Minh would be able
to negotiate with the NLF while maintaining the
Saigon government intact and in Western hands.
Huntington also calls for the Saigon
government to grant relative autonomy to the
NLF in the rural areas it controls, if they agree to
recognize the Saigon government and to
participate in peaceful political competition in
electoral politics. The urban areas and some of the
'pacified' country side would remain in the hands
of Saigon (and the U.S.). The U.S. would help
design the rules of the game and would'overtly or
covertly' back the desired political actors in the
struggle for power that would insue. Huntington
then counts on a two-pronged effort to undermine
the NLF: on the one hand, the U.S. should be able
to manipulate, as well as encourage organization of
the non-communist urban groups so that they can
win in competition with the NLF, at least in the
cities; on the other hand, the forces of capitalist
economic development and urban culture, as they
spread from the cities to the country side should
undermine the socialist revolution and the popular
support of the NLF.
It is important, then, that the U.S. allow
sufficient time for the urban opposition forces to
organize themselves before the competition begins.
It is also likely when and if the U.S. thinks it can
rely on these forces, it will usher Thieu and Ky off
the stage, their historical mission fulfilled.
But the other side of the strategy is to isolate
the querillas not only from the population by
urbanizing it, but also from outside aid. To do
this, Nixon invaded Cambodia, and has been
massively attacking the Ho Chi Minh trail (he is
dropping the equivalent of 3 Hiroshima size
atomic bombs per month, UPI 5 Nov). But Saigon
reports that the infiltration rate has doubled,
indicating once again the failure of conventional
bombing. If Nixon intends to completely sever the
supply lines, he may well be forced to some such
weaponry against the trail as atomic land mines or
other tactical nuclear weapons.
Latest Attack
, The recent attack on North Vietnam could
serve many purposes. It could be an attempt to
routinize the American right to attack the North
at any time; it could be to prepare the public for
an attack on the Trail, or prepare the public for
saturation bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in
order to 'get at the source' of men and supplies.
(See Morton Halperin, NYT, 7 Nov. 1970)
The U.S. has tried the bombing of the North
before and found it counter-productive. It is
possible that Nixon would try to present a nuclear
attack on the Trail as the lesser of two evils
compared to the saturation bombing of civilians in
North Vietnam.
The primary thrust of the Nixon strategy is to
achieve a favorable political settlement, and the
Huntington strategy may be his means. An
American victory through a political settlement
would be a greater victory internationally than
victory through nuclear escalation.
But like all previous policymakers, Nixon,
Kissinger, and Huntington misjudge the
Vietnamese situation: they underestimate the
ability of the NLF to organize in the cities; and
they fail to understand the dynamics of the
Vietnamese revolution. For the NLF is presently
fighting not socialist, but a national-bourgeois
revolution. The front seeks a united front, of all
social classes and strata in the anti-imperialist
struggle to throw out the U.S. It is quite consistent
for the NLF to co-operate with Big Minh type
forces, and to accept the non-communists in
power as the U.S. withdraws, confident that the
dynamics of the revolution will catapult Vietnam
quickly into a socialist revolution after the U.S.
departs.

severance of the supply lines could be his hope for
a trump. A pressing concern is the fact that, as
Henry Kissinger wrote, "Unfortunately, our
military strength has no political corollary; we
have been unable so far to create a political
structure that could survive military opposition
from Hanoi after we withdraw."
More Escalations
Although the military escalations and Nixon's
promises for a "peace that would deter future
warmakers" have portended of more massive
escalations, the main problem Nixon has to deal
with is creation in South Vietnam of the
"political structure that could survive..." It
seems that Nixon is hoping to achieve a political
settlement close to that advocated by the
establishment "Doves," and Nixon's military
operations are directed toward making his political
settlement work in American favor.
Nixon has had to pressure Thieu and Ky to
allow open political opposition to their regime and
to the U.S. military presence so that the peace
forces can organize themselves as a strong
non-communist alternative to the NLF. Two years
ago this plan was suggested by Kissingers's
colleague at Harvard, Samuel P. Huntington,
Chairman of the Department of Government.
Huntington pointed out that the U.S. has been
upstaging Maoist guerilla war by 'urbanizing
through massive bombing and artillery in South
Vietnam and thus taking the society out of the
stage where it is susceptible to rural revolution.
Even though the U.S. has 'urbanized' South
Vietnam (with the hope of destroying the NLF
infrastructure among the surviving population),
Huntington argues, there will still be strong
opposition to the Saigon government in the cities.
In his paper for the Southeast Asia Development
Advisory Group, entitled "Getting Ready for
Political Competition in South Vietnam,"
Huntington proposes that the U.S. must organize
the urban opposition to the Saigon regime before
the NLF does.
He suggested that the U.S. back General Duong
Van Minh ("Big Minh") and the Buddhists, among
others. And recently Minh has emerged in Saigon
as the leading candidate for the 1971 presidential
elections, backed by a unprecedented alliance of
opposition groups. His candidacy has been greeted

banning garrett

by the NLF, who feel they could negotiate a
settlement if Big Minh were in power in Saigon.
Nixon's Hope
Kissinger warned in January 1969 that U.S.
involvement in an attempt to "impose a coalition
government" on South Vietnam "may well
destroy the existing political structure of South
Viet Nam and thus lead to a communist takeover.
But Nixon may hope that Big Minh would be able
to negotiate with the NLF while maintaining the
Saigon government intact and in Western hands.
Huntington also calls for the Saigon
government to grant relative autonomy to the
NLF in the rural areas it controls, if they agree to
recognize the Saigon government and to
participate in peaceful political competition in
electoral politics. The urban areas and some of the
'pacified' country side would remain in the hands
of Saigon (and the U.S.). The U.S. would help
design the rules of the game and would'overtly or
covertly' back the desired political actors in the
struggle for power that would insue. Huntington
then counts on a two-pronged effort to undermine
the NLF: on the one hand, the U.S. should be able
to manipulate, as well as encourage organization of
the non-communist urban groups so that they can
win in competition with the NLF, at least in the
cities; on the other hand, the forces of capitalist
economic development and urban culture, as they
spread from the cities to the country side should
undermine the socialist revolution and the popular
support of the NLF.
It is important, then, that the U.S. allow
sufficient time for the urban opposition forces to
organize themselves before the competition begins.
It is also likely when and if the U.S. thinks it can
rely on these forces, it will usher Thieu and Ky off
the stage, their historical mission fulfilled.
But the other side of the strategy is to isolate
the querillas not only from the population by
urbanizing it, but also from outside aid. To do
this, Nixon invaded Cambodia, and has been
massively attacking the Ho Chi Minh trail (he is
dropping the equivalent of 3 Hiroshima size
atomic bombs per month, UPI 5 Nov). But Saigon
reports that the infiltration rate has doubled,
indicating once again the failure of conventional
bombing. If Nixon intends to completely sever the
supply lines, he may well be forced to some such
weaponry against the trail as atomic land mines or
other tactical nuclear weapons.
Latest Attack
, The recent attack on North Vietnam could
serve many purposes. It could be an attempt to
routinize the American right to attack the North
at any time; it could be to prepare the public for
an attack on the Trail, or prepare the public for
saturation bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in
order to 'get at the source' of men and supplies.
(See Morton Halperin, NYT, 7 Nov. 1970)
The U.S. has tried the bombing of the North
before and found it counter-productive. It is
possible that Nixon would try to present a nuclear
attack on the Trail as the lesser of two evils
compared to the saturation bombing of civilians in
North Vietnam.
The primary thrust of the Nixon strategy is to
achieve a favorable political settlement, and the
Huntington strategy may be his means. An
American victory through a political settlement
would be a greater victory internationally than
victory through nuclear escalation.
But like all previous policymakers, Nixon,
Kissinger, and Huntington misjudge the
Vietnamese situation: they underestimate the
ability of the NLF to organize in the cities; and
they fail to understand the dynamics of the
Vietnamese revolution. For the NLF is presently
fighting not socialist, but a national-bourgeois
revolution. The front seeks a united front, of all
social classes and strata in the anti-imperialist
struggle to throw out the U.S. It is quite consistent
for the NLF to co-operate with Big Minh type
forces, and to accept the non-communists in
power as the U.S. withdraws, confident that the
dynamics of the revolution will catapult Vietnam
quickly into a socialist revolution after the U.S.
departs.
The "waves of U.S. planes" ranging "deep into
North Vietnam" are an ominous harbinger of
Nixon's future military moves in Indochina. What
that future might bring may well be presented in
the November 15 New York Times by chief
foreign correspondent, C.L. Sulzberger. He argued
that "Limited commitments to conventional
defense are seen as increasingly outmoded, and yet
total warfare is a dreadful
absurdity .. . Consequently, the search focuses on
a third solution - between impossible nuclear
disaster and unsuccessful conventional warfare.
The answer may well lie in the field of truly
tactical atomic weapons."
Nixon and his chief foreign policy advisor,
Henry Kissinger, know that they cannot achieve a
military victory through conventional warfare.
Once they have committed themselves to
withdrawing troops, they know they can achieve
victory only through a political settlement. And
they have a definite strategy to "win" through a
political settlement. But a necessary part of that
strategy is to militarily weaken the NLF by isolating
them from North Vietnamese support. This side of
their strategy they are pursuing may force them to
a further, possibly nuclear, escalation.
Bombings Fail
The massive conventional bombings against the
trail have failed to stop "infiltration." Atomic land
mines or other tactical nuclear weapons, by
contaminating the Trail, could form a relatively
permanent radioactive barrier between North and
South Vietnam. (This sort of weapon would not
be directed at civilian populations.) Aware of
the impossibility of a military victory Nixon's
strategy is to establish a position of military
strength from which negotiate a favorable political
settlement. Since the "Vietnamization" of the war
seems to be a failure on military grounds, the
severance of the supply lines could be his hope for
a trump. A pressing concern is the fact that, as

Advisory Group, entitled "Getting Ready for
Political Competition in South Vietnam,"
Huntington proposes that the U.S. must organize
the urban opposition to the Saigon regime before
the NLF does.
He suggested that the U.S. back General Duong
Van Minh ("Big Minh") and the Buddhists, among
others. And recently Minh has emerged in Saigon
as the leading candidate for the 1971 presidential
elections, backed by a unprecedented alliance of
opposition groups. His candidacy has been greeted

banning garrett

by the NLF, who feel they could negotiate a
settlement if Big Minh were in power in Saigon.
Nixon's Hope
Kissinger warned in January 1969 that U.S.
involvement in an attempt to "impose a coalition
government" on South Vietnam "may well
destroy the existing political structure of South
Viet Nam and thus lead to a communist takeover.
But Nixon may hope that Big Minh would be able
to negotiate with the NLF while maintaining the
Saigon government intact and in Western hands.
Huntington also calls for the Saigon
government to grant relative autonomy to the
NLF in the rural areas it controls, if they agree to
recognize the Saigon government and to
participate in peaceful political competition in
electoral politics. The urban areas and some of the
'pacified' country side would remain in the hands
of Saigon (and the U.S.). The U.S. would help
design the rules of the game and would'overtly or
covertly' back the desired political actors in the
struggle for power that would insue. Huntington
then counts on a two-pronged effort to undermine
the NLF: on the one hand, the U.S. should be able
to manipulate, as well as encourage organization of
the non-communist urban groups so that they can
win in competition with the NLF, at least in the
cities; on the other hand, the forces of capitalist
economic development and urban culture, as they
spread from the cities to the country side should
undermine the socialist revolution and the popular
support of the NLF.
It is important, then, that the U.S. allow
sufficient time for the urban opposition forces to
organize themselves before the competition begins.
It is also likely when and if the U.S. thinks it can
rely on these forces, it will usher Thieu and Ky off
the stage, their historical mission fulfilled.
But the other side of the strategy is to isolate
the querillas not only from the population by
urbanizing it, but also from outside aid. To do
this, Nixon invaded Cambodia, and has been
massively attacking the Ho Chi Minh trail (he is
dropping the equivalent of 3 Hiroshima size
atomic bombs per month, UPI 5 Nov). But Saigon
reports that the infiltration rate has doubled,
indicating once again the failure of conventional
bombing. If Nixon intends to completely sever the
supply lines, he may well be forced to some such
weaponry against the trail as atomic land mines or
other tactical nuclear weapons.
Latest Attack
, The recent attack on North Vietnam could
serve many purposes. It could be an attempt to
routinize the American right to attack the North
at any time; it could be to prepare the public for
an attack on the Trail, or prepare the public for
saturation bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in
order to 'get at the source' of men and supplies.
(See Morton Halperin, NYT, 7 Nov. 1970)
The U.S. has tried the bombing of the North
before and found it counter-productive. It is
possible that Nixon would try to present a nuclear
attack on the Trail as the lesser of two evils
compared to the saturation bombing of civilians in
North Vietnam.
The primary thrust of the Nixon strategy is to
achieve a favorable political settlement, and the
Huntington strategy may be his means. An
American victory through a political settlement
would be a greater victory internationally than
victory through nuclear escalation.
But like all previous policymakers, Nixon,
Kissinger, and Huntington misjudge the
Vietnamese situation: they underestimate the
ability of the NLF to organize in the cities; and
they fail to understand the dynamics of the
Vietnamese revolution. For the NLF is presently
fighting not socialist, but a national-bourgeois
revolution. The front seeks a united front, of all
social classes and strata in the anti-imperialist
struggle to throw out the U.S. It is quite consistent
for the NLF to co-operate with Big Minh type
forces, and to accept the non-communists in
power as the U.S. withdraws, confident that the
dynamics of the revolution will catapult Vietnam
quickly into a socialist revolution after the U.S.
departs.
The "waves of U.S. planes" ranging "deep into
North Vietnam" are an ominous harbinger of
Nixon's future military moves in Indochina. What
that future might bring may well be presented in
the November 15 New York Times by chief
foreign correspondent, C.L. Sulzberger. He argued
that "Limited commitments to conventional
defense are seen as increasingly outmoded, and yet
total warfare is a dreadful
absurdity .. . Consequently, the search focuses on
a third solution - between impossible nuclear
disaster and unsuccessful conventional warfare.
The answer may well lie in the field of truly
tactical atomic weapons."
Nixon and his chief foreign policy advisor,
Henry Kissinger, know that they cannot achieve a
military victory through conventional warfare.
Once they have committed themselves to
withdrawing troops, they know they can achieve
victory only through a political settlement. And
they have a definite strategy to "win" through a
political settlement. But a necessary part of that
strategy is to militarily weaken the NLF by isolating
them from North Vietnamese support. This side of
their strategy they are pursuing may force them to
a further, possibly nuclear, escalation.
Bombings Fail
The massive conventional bombings against the
trail have failed to stop "infiltration." Atomic land
mines or other tactical nuclear weapons, by
contaminating the Trail, could form a relatively
permanent radioactive barrier between North and
South Vietnam. (This sort of weapon would not
be directed at civilian populations.) Aware of
the impossibility of a military victory Nixon's
strategy is to establish a position of military
strength from which negotiate a favorable political
settlement. Since the "Vietnamization" of the war
seems to be a failure on military grounds, the
severance of the supply lines could be his hope for
a trump. A pressing concern is the fact that, as
Henry Kissinger wrote, "Unfortunately, our
military strength has no political corollary; we
have been unable so far to create a political
structure that could survive military opposition
from Hanoi after we withdraw."
More Escalations
Although the military escalations and Nixon's
promises for a "peace that would deter future
warmakers" have portended of more massive
escalations, the main problem Nixon has to deal
with is creation in South Vietnam of the
"political structure that could survive..." It
seems that Nixon is hoping to achieve a political
settlement close to that advocated by the
establishment "Doves," and Nixon's military
operations are directed toward making his political
settlement work in American favor.
Nixon has had to pressure Thieu and Ky to
allow open political opposition to their regime and
to the U.S. military presence so that the peace
forces can organize themselves as a strong
non-communist alternative to the NLF. Two years
ago this plan was suggested by Kissingers's
colleague at Harvard, Samuel P. Huntington,
Chairman of the Department of Government.
Huntington pointed out that the U.S. has been
upstaging Maoist guerilla war by 'urbanizing
through massive bombing and artillery in South
Vietnam and thus taking the society out of the
stage where it is susceptible to rural revolution.
Even though the U.S. has 'urbanized' South
Vietnam (with the hope of destroying the NLF
infrastructure among the surviving population),
Huntington argues, there will still be strong
opposition to the Saigon government in the cities.

to manipulate, as well as encourage organization of
the non-communist urban groups so that they can
win in competition with the NLF, at least in the
cities; on the other hand, the forces of capitalist
economic development and urban culture, as they
spread from the cities to the country side should
undermine the socialist revolution and the popular
support of the NLF.
It is important, then, that the U.S. allow
sufficient time for the urban opposition forces to
organize themselves before the competition begins.
It is also likely when and if the U.S. thinks it can
rely on these forces, it will usher Thieu and Ky off
the stage, their historical mission fulfilled.
But the other side of the strategy is to isolate
the querillas not only from the population by
urbanizing it, but also from outside aid. To do
this, Nixon invaded Cambodia, and has been
massively attacking the Ho Chi Minh trail (he is
dropping the equivalent of 3 Hiroshima size
atomic bombs per month, UPI 5 Nov). But Saigon
reports that the infiltration rate has doubled,
indicating once again the failure of conventional
bombing. If Nixon intends to completely sever the
supply lines, he may well be forced to some such
weaponry against the trail as atomic land mines or
other tactical nuclear weapons.
Latest Attack
, The recent attack on North Vietnam could
serve many purposes. It could be an attempt to
routinize the American right to attack the North
at any time; it could be to prepare the public for
an attack on the Trail, or prepare the public for
saturation bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in
order to 'get at the source' of men and supplies.
(See Morton Halperin, NYT, 7 Nov. 1970)
The U.S. has tried the bombing of the North
before and found it counter-productive. It is
possible that Nixon would try to present a nuclear
attack on the Trail as the lesser of two evils
compared to the saturation bombing of civilians in
North Vietnam.
The primary thrust of the Nixon strategy is to
achieve a favorable political settlement, and the
Huntington strategy may be his means. An
American victory through a political settlement
would be a greater victory internationally than
victory through nuclear escalation.
But like all previous policymakers, Nixon,
Kissinger, and Huntington misjudge the
Vietnamese situation: they underestimate the
ability of the NLF to organize in the cities; and
they fail to understand the dynamics of the
Vietnamese revolution. For the NLF is presently
fighting not socialist, but a national-bourgeois
revolution. The front seeks a united front, of all
social classes and strata in the anti-imperialist
struggle to throw out the U.S. It is quite consistent
for the NLF to co-operate with Big Minh type
forces, and to accept the non-communists in
power as the U.S. withdraws, confident that the
dynamics of the revolution will catapult Vietnam
quickly into a socialist revolution after the U.S.
departs.
The "waves of U.S. planes" ranging "deep into
North Vietnam" are an ominous harbinger of
Nixon's future military moves in Indochina. What
that future might bring may well be presented in
the November 15 New York Times by chief
foreign correspondent, C.L. Sulzberger. He argued
that "Limited commitments to conventional
defense are seen as increasingly outmoded, and yet
total warfare is a dreadful
absurdity .. . Consequently, the search focuses on
a third solution - between impossible nuclear
disaster and unsuccessful conventional warfare.
The answer may well lie in the field of truly
tactical atomic weapons."
Nixon and his chief foreign policy advisor,
Henry Kissinger, know that they cannot achieve a
military victory through conventional warfare.
Once they have committed themselves to
withdrawing troops, they know they can achieve
victory only through a political settlement. And
they have a definite strategy to "win" through a
political settlement. But a necessary part of that
strategy is to militarily weaken the NLF by isolating
them from North Vietnamese support. This side of
their strategy they are pursuing may force them to
a further, possibly nuclear, escalation.
Bombings Fail
The massive conventional bombings against the
trail have failed to stop "infiltration." Atomic land
mines or other tactical nuclear weapons, by
contaminating the Trail, could form a relatively
permanent radioactive barrier between North and
South Vietnam. (This sort of weapon would not
be directed at civilian populations.) Aware of
the impossibility of a military victory Nixon's
strategy is to establish a position of military
strength from which negotiate a favorable political
settlement. Since the "Vietnamization" of the war
seems to be a failure on military grounds, the
severance of the supply lines could be his hope for
a trump. A pressing concern is the fact that, as
Henry Kissinger wrote, "Unfortunately, our
military strength has no political corollary; we
have been unable so far to create a political
structure that could survive military opposition
from Hanoi after we withdraw."
More Escalations
Although the military escalations and Nixon's
promises for a "peace that would deter future
warmakers" have portended of more massive
escalations, the main problem Nixon has to deal
with is creation in South Vietnam of the
"political structure that could survive..." It
seems that Nixon is hoping to achieve a political
settlement close to that advocated by the
establishment "Doves," and Nixon's military
operations are directed toward making his political
settlement work in American favor.
Nixon has had to pressure Thieu and Ky to
allow open political opposition to their regime and
to the U.S. military presence so that the peace
forces can organize themselves as a strong
non-communist alternative to the NLF. Two years
ago this plan was suggested by Kissingers's
colleague at Harvard, Samuel P. Huntington,
Chairman of the Department of Government.
Huntington pointed out that the U.S. has been
upstaging Maoist guerilla war by 'urbanizing
through massive bombing and artillery in South
Vietnam and thus taking the society out of the
stage where it is susceptible to rural revolution.
Even though the U.S. has 'urbanized' South
Vietnam (with the hope of destroying the NLF
infrastructure among the surviving population),
Huntington argues, there will still be strong
opposition to the Saigon government in the cities.
In his paper for the Southeast Asia Development
Advisory Group, entitled "Getting Ready for
Political Competition in South Vietnam,"
Huntington proposes that the U.S. must organize
the urban opposition to the Saigon regime before
the NLF does.
He suggested that the U.S. back General Duong
Van Minh ("Big Minh") and the Buddhists, among
others. And recently Minh has emerged in Saigon
as the leading candidate for the 1971 presidential
elections, backed by a unprecedented alliance of
opposition groups. His candidacy has been greeted

banning garrett

by the NLF, who feel they could negotiate a
settlement if Big Minh were in power in Saigon.
Nixon's Hope
Kissinger warned in January 1969 that U.S.
involvement in an attempt to "impose a coalition
government" on South Vietnam "may well
destroy the existing political structure of South
Viet Nam and thus lead to a communist takeover.
But Nixon may hope that Big Minh would be able
to negotiate with the NLF while maintaining the
Saigon government intact and in Western hands.
Huntington also calls for the Saigon
government to grant relative autonomy to the
NLF in the rural areas it controls, if they agree to
recognize the Saigon government and to
participate in peaceful political competition in
electoral politics. The urban areas and some of the
'pacified' country side would remain in the hands
of Saigon (and the U.S.). The U.S. would help
design the rules of the game and would'overtly or
covertly' back the desired political actors in the
struggle for power that would insue. Huntington
then counts on a two-pronged effort to undermine
the NLF: on the one hand, the U.S. should be able
to manipulate, as well as encourage organization of
the non-communist urban groups so that they can
win in competition with the NLF, at least in the
cities; on the other hand, the forces of capitalist
economic development and urban culture, as they
spread from the cities to the country side should
undermine the socialist revolution and the popular
support of the NLF.
It is important, then, that the U.S. allow
sufficient time for the urban opposition forces to
