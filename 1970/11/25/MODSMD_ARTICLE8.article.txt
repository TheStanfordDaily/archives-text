## Bombing Justified 
### 
Throughout the entire period
of the war in.Vietnam the United
States has bombed the North for
one reason: the North has
continually sent its troops south
to kill and maim.
It has been in an effort to
protect the right of South
Vietnamese self-determination
that we have intervened at all. We
have been bombing an oppressive
invader who adamantly refuses
any status quo settlement or
negotiated settlement of any kind.
At the slightest hint of serious
negotiations we have always been
more than ready to suspend
bombing. Yet the North has not
seen fit to negotiate with us.
We have been dealing with a
system which demands that an
unwilling South be forcefully

subjected to its rule. This
totalitarian system makes no
room for the possibility of free
elections. It, in fact, makes room
for no elections of any
consequence at all.
The policy in North Vietnam,
as in all Communist countries, is
that elections are held with only
Party candidates on the ballot.
Since there is no accumulation of
private wealth allowed there is no
source for financing a significant
write-in campaign and the result is
a dictatorship of the Communist
Party.
Beside the Communist system
the elections in the south have
been most magnanimous in their
inclusion of a variety of
candidates who actually disagree
with each other over some issues.
In fact, they disagree to such an

extent that the winners of
elections have been known to
have opposing losers arrested - an
occurrence unheard of in the
North where a dissenter would be
incarcerated long before he ever
thought of running for office.
1 hate to harp on the facts, but
they still indicate that not one
single Communist state has ever
permitted itself to be peacefully
(or revolutionarily) replaced by
any opposition party or by any
other form of government. This
fact, coupled with the total lack
of individual civil rights under the
Communist system, argues very
strongly in favor of any measures
which serve to halt the spread of
this form of government. We
have fought in Vietnam to assure
that some part of South Vietnam
will be free to pursue its destiny
in a non-Communist direction. So
far there has been no admission
on the part of the North that
there is a valid non-Communist
faction in the South.
They offer no provisions for
those who demand the most
rudimentary of civil rights, but
insist that they subject themselves
to the Communist conformity
whirh dehumanizes so much of
the world. To argue that most
South Vietnamese would be
happier under Communism is to
say that with respect to their
ability to enjoy any civil rights
they are subhuman and less than
equal to ourselves.
With respect to the raid which
sought to free some of the US
prisoners now captive in North
Vietnam, we are seeking to
increase the pressure on the North
to treat our prisoners in a
reasonably humane way. Thus far
we have found no effective way to
assure even that the families of
such prisoners know whether they
are alive or dead. No mailing
rights have been guaranteed, and
so on.
Any operation dealing with
prisoners of war should provide
for some of these basic things and
ultimately should provide for
repatriation of all prisoners willing
to be repatriated. Were these basic
humanitarian provisions made
then it would make less sense to
stage a raid such as we did.
However, given the conditions
which exist this raid must be seen
as an effort to extract reasonable
behavior from a recalcitrant foe.
To assert that we have no right
to "invade" North Vietnam is
ridiculous in light of their
continual infiltration of the South
and their treatment of American
prisoners. Until such time as
serious negotiations commence to
clear up both problems it is
impossible to morally or
otherwise condemn either the
bombing or the incursions.
