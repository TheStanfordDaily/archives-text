And â€¢ Semitism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Granted the fact that Jews have been in the
vanguard of revolutionary thought for the
past several thousand years, it is still an
intriguing matter that the FBI seems to be
plagued by the thought that the International
Jewish Commie Conspiracy is creeping up
even in such strongholds of White
Anglo-Saxon Protestant Americanism as
Stanford University.
One wonders if the "Kon Goldsteins" and
"Norman Levines" are bestowed with such
proper Jewish pseudonyms in the interest of
history, or for the purpose of discrediting
Jews not only with middle America, but with
the radical movement itself. There is a
terrifying ease with which the informant issue
could play about the insecurities of all
involved:
"Jews are typically commies, so our
infiltrators must all seem to be Jews" (Middle
America, J. Edgar, et al).
"Jews are typically clever, furtive
intellectuals, so naturally the traitors will be
Jews" (certain scared radicals).
Reactionary thinking can produce more
destructive fear. Stanford Jews begin to feel
that queasy urge to become acceptable to the
world at large. Presently, Jews are relatively
safe in the United States. The thought of
leading those strained, tenuous lives of our
parents frightens many of us into a kind of
Uncle Max, sublimated existence. The great
insecurities produced by the informant issue
make this kind of existence all the more
attractive.
After Auschwitz, not even a Stanford Jew
can allow himself the ease of abandoning his
historical, traditional struggle against
oppression. One can only hope that Stanford

Jews will recognize the frightening,
destructive strategy of the FBI, and use that
recognition to prove to themselves that Jews
must continue to act against the very real
oppression of peoples in this country.

Baltic Studies
Editor, THE DAILY:
In spite of the staggering collection of
interesting lectures to be given in diverse fields
during the Conference on Baltic (Area)
Studies in San Jose State Thanksgiving
weekend by historians, political scientists,
literary critics, linguists, archeologists,
anthropologists etc., of 21 nationalities from
all over the world, I meet apathetic disinterest
whenever I suggest the Conference as an
educational pastime (and opportunity to
make contacts for later job opportunities).
A friend yesterday said: "I just can't seem
to get excited about the Baits ..." and then
to me: "You're even serious about it all,
aren't you?" This surprised me, as I had
thought "Area Studies" was a fad (African,
Indian, Far Eastern studies etc. are popular.)
Stanford dollies and rich spoiled brats live
according to fads.
The answer is that "fads" have to be
narrowed down more. Fads such as "ending
imperialism and colonialism" or interest in
ethnic cultures are too broad for the
spoon-fed minds here. The fad has been
Vietnam and Cuba for a long time now
(rightly so, but too exclusively). Last spring it
included Cambodia. But when I said to my
German-1 class: "let's all sell our Rosebowl
tickets and contribute the money to East
Pakistan," they laughed. If it had been last
spring and Cambodia, they might have

followed my suggestion. But East Pakistan is
not a fad this fall. And the Baits are not a fad.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Now that the Rose Bowl is getting so close,
and people are becoming very excited about
it, I would like to present some of my own
feelings about football, which are probably
very different from those of most people
attending the games.
I feel that football is a dehumanizing,
depersonalized sport, in which a huge mass of
people, having nothing in common but their
interest in this particular sport, are totally
absorbed in a group of players who have no
individual identity to their audience except
for their relative skill in playing. There is no
real group feeling among the spectators; they
at best ignore each other and at worst are rude
to each other.
The game excites the spectators to such an
extent that they become violent and cruel.
"Kill 'em", "Hit 'em," they shout to their
team.
Some people will argue that football is a
harmless sport. But is this violent, hateful
attitude harmless? Is this depersonalized
attitude toward both players and other
spectators harmless? I think people's attitude
toward football typifies their attitude toward
society and poeple in general. I think that
what we need is more sensitivity, more giving,
more love. But as long as people pour so much
of their energies and frustrations into football,
both in watching and playing it, as far as I can
see there can be no room for love.
