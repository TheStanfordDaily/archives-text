Pruc MECCA AC OF APRIL FOOLS
by Lee Foster
Jeremy Whitfield, a promis
ing Stanford freshman, drops
out. Why? He lives in a world
collapsing outside and inside
him. He struggles with institu
tions that sprawl — unceas
ingly — beyond effective ra
tional control. And beyond
human compassion. This is a
wildly satirical, original, and
i provocative new novel. $2.95
