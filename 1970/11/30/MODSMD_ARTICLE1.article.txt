# Minorities' Problems More Critical Than Ecology
## 
### LAVERNE DICKINSON 
Resentment and sometimes outright anger
characterize the reaction of minority groups to
the recent emphasis on environmental and
population problems.
"Sure, these problems are important, but the
needs of our people are just as important" is the
gist of the most moderate positions regarding
ecology issues. Blacks and Chicanos term the
emphasis on the problem of ecology as "not
directed toward the interests of minority groups
in this country."
Medical student Eddie Alderete explains:
"There are so many human and social
problem schools to admit blacks, chicano and
Indian students; failure of the community to
recognize the plight of the worker, especially
minority groups where the minimum wage scale
is not being applied.
"Whites experience no real arousal of a sense
of urgency about these problems. They see it
only as an unfortunate situation. Whereas
minority groups see it as the top social problem
today and feel it should be given priority."
Another student here, Louis Solis, regards
environmental concern as "very important in
itself" but adds "I could see putting my efforts
in that for myself but then maybe I'll see my
people suffer. I need to work for our more
immediate needs. It's easier for the white middle
class to relate to the environment."
Main Polluters
Hilda Cantu, also a student, points out,
"Whites do most of the polluting anyway
because they have all these appliances and
gadgets and stuff."

According to a statement prepared by the
Black Student Union, (BSU) this month, whites
have completely missed the boat in their
emphasis on ecology. Black ecology and white
ecology are two very different concepts.
The BSU states that "black ecology stems
from the fact that 1) black and white
environments differ, 2) the causes and solutions
to ecological problems are fundamentally
different in the suburbs and ghettos, and 3) the
solutions set forth for the ecological crisis are, in
reality, reformist and evasive of the social and
political revolution which black environmental
correction demands.
Pollution Follows
"The ecology crisis arose when the white
community discovered that the kind of
pollution which exists in the hearts of major
cities (where the mass of urban blacks are
located) could follow them to the suburb.
"We have been herded into what is now
called the 'ghetto'. This systematic
imprisonment has created a greater degree of all
varieties of pollutants; smoke, soot, dust, fly
ash, fumes, stench, and carbon
monoxide .. . The contradiction is, while
automobiles are generally considered to be the
major source of air pollution, white commuters
from the suburb and outer limits of the central
city drive into the central city (the ghetto) for
work, recreation, etc. polluting the black
environment further."
Contradictory Opinions
Minority group members express
contradicting opinions on the importance of
population control. Many feel that when
overpopulation is mentioned, too often the
finger is pointed at them as the major culprits.
Gov. Reagan's proposal of mandatory birth

control for welfare mothers last spring was seen
as a racial insult.
On the other hand, Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm in her autobiography Unbought and
Unbossed writes that there is a "suspicion
among many blacks that even birth control
clinics are a plot by the white power structure

to keep down the numbers of blacks . . . But I
do not know any black or Puerto Rican women
who feel that way. To label family planning and
legal abortion programs 'genocide' is male
rhetoric, for male ears."
Linda Lopez, a chicano student, disagrees.
Commenting on noted biologist Paul Erbich's
statement that the most admired woman in a

few years will be "a sterilized woman with two
adopted children," Miss Lopez tersely explains,
"He's not a woman."
After Middle Class
Hilda Cantu adds, "He does understand how
the minorities feel, though. He's after the white
middle class who do most of the polluting."
Louis Solis says that the emphasis on
population control is "very bad. Chicanos like
to have lots of kids. There are too many whites
and not enough chicanos."
Eddie Alderete provides an explanation of
the chicano reaction to population control: "I
think overpopulation is a problem which merits
attention today. But I think the means being
proposed by some people do not justify the
ends—such as taxing individuals for having large
families instead of giving them exemptions.
"I'd go to jail first and make welfare support
my family.
Other Problems
"Our negative reaction is primarily due to the
fact that there are so many more pressing
problems facing chicanos that have never been
given any attention. These people are starting to
rise from an oppressed situation through their
own hard work and the leadership of a few.
"In come the white doctors and sociologists
and an assortment of 'pseudo-experts: and they
start birth control centers and offer free birth
control devices and advice, but they are less
concerned with the underlying situation that has
led these people to have such large families
without the means to take care of them—such as
lack of education, lack of employment
opportunities, lack of transportation and lack of
adequate medical faciltiies.
"It's difficult to go into a community and

urge birth control when it's the first real
concern shown by the ruling majority and can
be thought to be racism in disguise."
Minority Resentment
A Roman Catholic priest from St. Francis of
Assisi Church in East Palo Alto explains that
many minority group members resent the
emphasis on birth control. They say, "Who's
going to tell me how many kids I can have? We
have a big world." Others, however, are more
concerned about overpopulation.
The BSU statement argues that "the
contradiction is that while we're told that
population is becoming a serious problem and
that birth control pills should be taken,
two-thirds of the people in the United States
now live in 212 metropolitan areas comprising
only one-tenth of the total land area; but we're
running out of space.
"Well, the fact is black people have always
had to make more room. In other words, when
Dick Gregory said, 'to go to the bathroom at
night he had to leave a bookmark so he
wouldn't lose his place, he wasn't bullshittin!"
Excessive Attention
Minority groups feel that an excessive
amount of attention is being directed at the
ecology crisis. Their problems also consitiute a
very real crisis, and they are being forgotten
during the consideration of a "popular issue."
As Mr. Odis White, a resident of East Palo
Alto, concludes: "I'm worried about pollution
and overpopulation. All of these things are
important—racial problems, unemployment,
education, pollution, population. We should
work to solve all of these problems at the same
time, the quicker the better. But I'm afraid not
too much is being done."

have a big world." Others, however, are more
concerned about overpopulation.
The BSU statement argues that "the
contradiction is that while we're told that
population is becoming a serious problem and
that birth control pills should be taken,
two-thirds of the people in the United States
now live in 212 metropolitan areas comprising
only one-tenth of the total land area; but we're
running out of space.
"Well, the fact is black people have always
had to make more room. In other words, when
Dick Gregory said, 'to go to the bathroom at
night he had to leave a bookmark so he
wouldn't lose his place, he wasn't bullshittin!"
Excessive Attention
Minority groups feel that an excessive
amount of attention is being directed at the
ecology crisis. Their problems also consitiute a
very real crisis, and they are being forgotten
during the consideration of a "popular issue."
As Mr. Odis White, a resident of East Palo
Alto, concludes: "I'm worried about pollution
and overpopulation. All of these things are
important—racial problems, unemployment,
education, pollution, population. We should
work to solve all of these problems at the same
time, the quicker the better. But I'm afraid not
too much is being done."

Resentment and sometimes outright anger
characterize the reaction of minority groups to
the recent emphasis on environmental and
population problems.
"Sure, these problems are important, but the
needs of our people are just as important" is the
gist of the most moderate positions regarding
ecology issues. Blacks and Chicanos term the
emphasis on the problem of ecology as "not
directed toward the interests of minority groups
in this country."
Medical student Eddie Alderete explains:
"There are so many human and social
problem schools to admit blacks, chicano and
Indian students; failure of the community to
recognize the plight of the worker, especially
minority groups where the minimum wage scale
is not being applied.
"Whites experience no real arousal of a sense
of urgency about these problems. They see it
only as an unfortunate situation. Whereas
minority groups see it as the top social problem
today and feel it should be given priority."
Another student here, Louis Solis, regards
environmental concern as "very important in
itself" but adds "I could see putting my efforts
in that for myself but then maybe I'll see my
people suffer. I need to work for our more
immediate needs. It's easier for the white middle
class to relate to the environment."
Main Polluters
Hilda Cantu, also a student, points out,
"Whites do most of the polluting anyway
because they have all these appliances and
gadgets and stuff."

According to a statement prepared by the
Black Student Union, (BSU) this month, whites
have completely missed the boat in their
emphasis on ecology. Black ecology and white
ecology are two very different concepts.
The BSU states that "black ecology stems
from the fact that 1) black and white
environments differ, 2) the causes and solutions
to ecological problems are fundamentally
different in the suburbs and ghettos, and 3) the
solutions set forth for the ecological crisis are, in
reality, reformist and evasive of the social and
political revolution which black environmental
correction demands.
Pollution Follows
"The ecology crisis arose when the white
community discovered that the kind of
pollution which exists in the hearts of major
cities (where the mass of urban blacks are
located) could follow them to the suburb.
"We have been herded into what is now
called the 'ghetto'. This systematic
imprisonment has created a greater degree of all
varieties of pollutants; smoke, soot, dust, fly
ash, fumes, stench, and carbon
monoxide .. . The contradiction is, while
automobiles are generally considered to be the
major source of air pollution, white commuters
from the suburb and outer limits of the central
city drive into the central city (the ghetto) for
work, recreation, etc. polluting the black
environment further."
Contradictory Opinions
Minority group members express
contradicting opinions on the importance of
population control. Many feel that when
overpopulation is mentioned, too often the
finger is pointed at them as the major culprits.
Gov. Reagan's proposal of mandatory birth

control for welfare mothers last spring was seen
as a racial insult.
On the other hand, Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm in her autobiography Unbought and
Unbossed writes that there is a "suspicion
among many blacks that even birth control
clinics are a plot by the white power structure

to keep down the numbers of blacks . . . But I
do not know any black or Puerto Rican women
who feel that way. To label family planning and
legal abortion programs 'genocide' is male
rhetoric, for male ears."
Linda Lopez, a chicano student, disagrees.
Commenting on noted biologist Paul Erbich's
statement that the most admired woman in a

few years will be "a sterilized woman with two
adopted children," Miss Lopez tersely explains,
"He's not a woman."
After Middle Class
Hilda Cantu adds, "He does understand how
the minorities feel, though. He's after the white
middle class who do most of the polluting."
Louis Solis says that the emphasis on
population control is "very bad. Chicanos like
to have lots of kids. There are too many whites
and not enough chicanos."
Eddie Alderete provides an explanation of
the chicano reaction to population control: "I
think overpopulation is a problem which merits
attention today. But I think the means being
proposed by some people do not justify the
ends—such as taxing individuals for having large
families instead of giving them exemptions.
"I'd go to jail first and make welfare support
my family.
Other Problems
"Our negative reaction is primarily due to the
fact that there are so many more pressing
problems facing chicanos that have never been
given any attention. These people are starting to
rise from an oppressed situation through their
own hard work and the leadership of a few.
"In come the white doctors and sociologists
and an assortment of 'pseudo-experts: and they
start birth control centers and offer free birth
control devices and advice, but they are less
concerned with the underlying situation that has
led these people to have such large families
without the means to take care of them—such as
lack of education, lack of employment
opportunities, lack of transportation and lack of
adequate medical faciltiies.
"It's difficult to go into a community and

urge birth control when it's the first real
concern shown by the ruling majority and can
be thought to be racism in disguise."
Minority Resentment
A Roman Catholic priest from St. Francis of
Assisi Church in East Palo Alto explains that
many minority group members resent the
emphasis on birth control. They say, "Who's

proposed by some people do not justify the
ends—such as taxing individuals for having large
families instead of giving them exemptions.
"I'd go to jail first and make welfare support
my family.
Other Problems
"Our negative reaction is primarily due to the
fact that there are so many more pressing
problems facing chicanos that have never been
given any attention. These people are starting to
rise from an oppressed situation through their
own hard work and the leadership of a few.
"In come the white doctors and sociologists
and an assortment of 'pseudo-experts: and they
start birth control centers and offer free birth
control devices and advice, but they are less
concerned with the underlying situation that has
led these people to have such large families
without the means to take care of them—such as
lack of education, lack of employment
opportunities, lack of transportation and lack of
adequate medical faciltiies.
"It's difficult to go into a community and

urge birth control when it's the first real
concern shown by the ruling majority and can
be thought to be racism in disguise."
Minority Resentment
A Roman Catholic priest from St. Francis of
Assisi Church in East Palo Alto explains that
many minority group members resent the
emphasis on birth control. They say, "Who's
going to tell me how many kids I can have? We
have a big world." Others, however, are more
concerned about overpopulation.
The BSU statement argues that "the
contradiction is that while we're told that
population is becoming a serious problem and
that birth control pills should be taken,
two-thirds of the people in the United States
now live in 212 metropolitan areas comprising
only one-tenth of the total land area; but we're
running out of space.
"Well, the fact is black people have always
had to make more room. In other words, when
Dick Gregory said, 'to go to the bathroom at
night he had to leave a bookmark so he
wouldn't lose his place, he wasn't bullshittin!"
Excessive Attention
Minority groups feel that an excessive
amount of attention is being directed at the
ecology crisis. Their problems also consitiute a
very real crisis, and they are being forgotten
during the consideration of a "popular issue."
As Mr. Odis White, a resident of East Palo
Alto, concludes: "I'm worried about pollution
and overpopulation. All of these things are
important—racial problems, unemployment,
education, pollution, population. We should
work to solve all of these problems at the same
time, the quicker the better. But I'm afraid not
too much is being done."

Resentment and sometimes outright anger
characterize the reaction of minority groups to
the recent emphasis on environmental and
population problems.
"Sure, these problems are important, but the
needs of our people are just as important" is the
gist of the most moderate positions regarding
ecology issues. Blacks and Chicanos term the
emphasis on the problem of ecology as "not
directed toward the interests of minority groups
in this country."
Medical student Eddie Alderete explains:
"There are so many human and social
problem schools to admit blacks, chicano and
Indian students; failure of the community to
recognize the plight of the worker, especially
minority groups where the minimum wage scale
is not being applied.
"Whites experience no real arousal of a sense
of urgency about these problems. They see it
only as an unfortunate situation. Whereas
minority groups see it as the top social problem
today and feel it should be given priority."
Another student here, Louis Solis, regards
environmental concern as "very important in
itself" but adds "I could see putting my efforts
in that for myself but then maybe I'll see my
people suffer. I need to work for our more
immediate needs. It's easier for the white middle
class to relate to the environment."
Main Polluters
Hilda Cantu, also a student, points out,
"Whites do most of the polluting anyway
because they have all these appliances and
gadgets and stuff."

According to a statement prepared by the
Black Student Union, (BSU) this month, whites
have completely missed the boat in their
emphasis on ecology. Black ecology and white
ecology are two very different concepts.
The BSU states that "black ecology stems
from the fact that 1) black and white
environments differ, 2) the causes and solutions
to ecological problems are fundamentally
different in the suburbs and ghettos, and 3) the
solutions set forth for the ecological crisis are, in
reality, reformist and evasive of the social and
political revolution which black environmental
correction demands.
Pollution Follows
"The ecology crisis arose when the white
community discovered that the kind of
pollution which exists in the hearts of major
cities (where the mass of urban blacks are
located) could follow them to the suburb.
"We have been herded into what is now
called the 'ghetto'. This systematic
imprisonment has created a greater degree of all
varieties of pollutants; smoke, soot, dust, fly
ash, fumes, stench, and carbon
monoxide .. . The contradiction is, while
automobiles are generally considered to be the
major source of air pollution, white commuters
from the suburb and outer limits of the central
city drive into the central city (the ghetto) for
work, recreation, etc. polluting the black
environment further."
Contradictory Opinions
Minority group members express
contradicting opinions on the importance of
population control. Many feel that when
overpopulation is mentioned, too often the
finger is pointed at them as the major culprits.
Gov. Reagan's proposal of mandatory birth

control for welfare mothers last spring was seen
as a racial insult.
On the other hand, Congresswoman Shirley
Chisholm in her autobiography Unbought and
Unbossed writes that there is a "suspicion
among many blacks that even birth control
clinics are a plot by the white power structure

to keep down the numbers of blacks . . . But I
do not know any black or Puerto Rican women
who feel that way. To label family planning and
legal abortion programs 'genocide' is male
rhetoric, for male ears."
Linda Lopez, a chicano student, disagrees.
Commenting on noted biologist Paul Erbich's
statement that the most admired woman in a

few years will be "a sterilized woman with two
adopted children," Miss Lopez tersely explains,
"He's not a woman."
After Middle Class
Hilda Cantu adds, "He does understand how
the minorities feel, though. He's after the white
middle class who do most of the polluting."
Louis Solis says that the emphasis on
population control is "very bad. Chicanos like
to have lots of kids. There are too many whites
and not enough chicanos."
Eddie Alderete provides an explanation of
the chicano reaction to population control: "I
think overpopulation is a problem which merits
attention today. But I think the means being
proposed by some people do not justify the
ends—such as taxing individuals for having large
families instead of giving them exemptions.
