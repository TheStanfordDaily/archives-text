## SES Chairman Terms Ph.D. Process Pointless 
### 
Universities can't get rid of the
Ph.D. symbol "but surely we have sense
enough to change its substance,"
Professor of Law Herbert L. Packer
suggests in the November issue of
Change magazine.
The Ph.D. has become so deeply
entrenched in American academic life
that attempts to substitute a master of
philosophy or doctor of arts "are
destined to become mere second-class
degrees," he declares.
Packer served as steering committee
chairman of the Study of Education at
Stanford, and currently heads a
Carnegie Commission study on reform
of legal education.
Calling for a "Trojan horse"
approach to graduate education reform,
he labels the present Ph.D.
requirements both "pointless" and
"irrelevant," and says graduate
education is "a tragic waste of
everyone's time." To obtain a Ph.D. in

English typically takes nearly 10 years,
and the median age of the recipient is
over 32, he notes.
While most Ph.D.'s become college
professors, he observes, "graduate
education has almost nothing to do
with preparation for teaching. "The
so-called 'pure' disciplines do almost
nothing to prepare their students for
the principal activity in which they
engage. "As undergraduates well know,
the graduate students receive almost
nothing from their elders by way of
preparation for university teaching,
other than the chance to 'sink-or-swim'
as section assistants, and ultimately,
instructors."
In place of the present Ph. D.-or
"piling higher and deeper"-degree
requirements, Packer would substitute:
1. Successfully passing an
examination of the candidate's
knowledge of his discipline;
2. Carefully supervised experience in

any one of several occupations he may
enter; and
3. Demonstrating, through a
research exercise, that the candidate
has mastered the methodology of his
field-and not that he has made an
original contribution to knowledge.
The apprenticeship requirement
could be met in a variety of
ways-serving as a research assistant to a
faculty member, for example; teaching
within the university, a nearby college,
or even high school; or serving an
externship in business, government, or
other fields off campus.
Windows Taped
Windows smashed in Monday night's
hit-and-run raid Nov. 23 have been
taped and boarded up and left "as is"
for the time being, according to
Elbridge Bacon, director of the
University's physical plant.
The 90 windows smashed will cost

about $3,000 to replace, he said.
The tape and boarding will be
maintained for security purposes until a
decision to replace the glass is made by
President Lyman, Bacon said.
"I'd just as soon leave them the way
they are as a monument to the
foolishness," Bacon added.
Chancellor Speaks
John Chanceller, NBC National
affairs coorespondent will give the
1970 Carlos McClatchy Memorial
lecture tonight (Mon.) at in the Nathan
Cummings Art Auditorium.
The lecture, open to the public, is
sponsored by the Department of
Communication and is entitled "He,
Che, Mae, Dick, and Spiro."
TTie lecture series was established in
1964 to bring distinguished individuals
to the University, and is named for the
founder and first editor of the Fresno
Bee.
