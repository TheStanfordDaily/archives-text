# $3.5 Million More
## Budget Cutbacks Continue 
### ED KOHN 
President Richard W. Lyman will discuss another
series of multi-million dollar cutbacks in the
University's Operating Budget at a press conference
today.
The cuts are a part of the Budget Adjustment
Program (BAP), which now has a goal of a $5,982
million reduction in the Operating Budget spending
over a five-year period. The previous BAP objective
was a $2.5 million reduction over a four-year span.
In its first year of operation (the 1 970 -71 budget),
BAP has reduced expenditures in the Operating
Budget, which totals more than $5 7 million this year,
by nearly $1.9 million. Half of that reduction has been
achieved by modifying the University's pre-paid
land-least 1 income policy and not through actual
spending cuts.
BAP, which is a year old, is an attempt by the
University to balance its budget without completely
eliminating the present University Reserve funds and
compromising student and staff services. Comprised of
students, staff, and administrators, it reports directly
to the president and the provost on matters dealing
with budget cutbacks.
One of the program's primary objectives is to slow
the rate of growth of the Operating Budget. At
present, the budget's growth rate is 12.1 percent
annually; if the program is successful, by 1 975 , the
year BAP hopes to balance the budget, the rate of
increase will be only 6.7 precent.
Inflation Cited
University officials have cited inflation, increased
staff, faculty and security costs and benefits, and
increases in student-related expenses, including the
establishment of new offices, such as Ombudsman, as
major factors behind the steadily-growing budget.
According to a report circulated among members of
the faculty Senate, the program's original goal of a
$2.5 million savings over four years may have been
"unrealistic" in terms of actual income and expenses.
The report states that administration officials were

determined to do a minimum amount of budget
cutting in the beginning of the program because of
inexperience at "tough-minded self-scrutiny/'
"Specific expense factors not fully contemplated a
year ago include higher salary increases for
non-academic staff, benefit increases for all staff,
establishment of a self-insurance reserve, augmentation
of campus security, student aid increases
(undergraduate and graduate), development of new
administrative offices (e.g., Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, Ombudsman, Vice President for
Research . . . ), library automation and the increased
costs of purchased goods and services," the report
states.
SES Recommendations
"A number of these increases, as well as other less
isolated expenditure pressures, are the direct or
indirect results of recommendations from the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES). Possible changes in
University support of graduate students made
necessary by declining outside support have not fully
been taken into account ..."
BAP I, which is in effect during the 1 970-71
budget, reduced spending over earlier projections in
the fields of instruction and libraries by nearly
$650,000 student services by $75,000, and
non-academic areas by nearly $260,000.
In connection with BAP, the University is laying
the groundwork for a five-year, $260 million
fundraising effort. Gifts and contributions to the
University presently total $30 million annually, and
University officials want to increase the total to $5 0
million "as soon as possible."
According to the faculty Senate report, the BAP
reduction goal will be the highest during the 1 972-73
budget — $1,283,000. The goal in its fifth and final
year, 197 4-75, is $679,000. Without BAP, the
University would be forced to spend more than $11
million of its endowment and reserve funds. Even if
BAP is successful, almost $3 million of the $5.6
million University Reserve fund will be spent to avoid
dipping into endowment monies.
