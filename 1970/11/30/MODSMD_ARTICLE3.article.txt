# Alumnae Urge Trustees To Stop Campus Discrimination Of Women
## 
### ROBERTA FARB 
Women may be the fairer sex in
more ways than one. No longer content
to accept socially defined sex roles,
many women wish, in fairness to both
women and men, to end institutional
discrimination and to humanize society
in the process.
According to Science Magazine, 4 3
colleges and universities have been
charged with discriminatory
employment practices against women.
The Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare Office of Contract
Compliance, Civil Rights Division, has
been asked to begin an immediate
"class" action and compliance review
of colleges charged with discrimination
in admissions, financial help for
graduate study, hiring practices,
promotion, and salary differentials.

"Women are second-class citizens on
many a campus," declares Dr. Nancy E.
Dowding, president of the Women's
Equity Action League. A Stanford
University alumnus, she contends that
discrimination against women does
indeed exist here. She has
originated a petition for "removing the
quota of half as many freshman women
as men, and other maldistributions in
admissions, scholarships, and faculty
appointments."
Equal Opportunity Demanded
Addressing her plea to the Board of
Trustees of Stanford, Dr. Cross urges
the execution of provision Fourth-16
of the Grant Founding and Endowing
The Leland Stanford Junior University,
"to afford equal facilities and give
equal advantages in the University to
both the sexes."
The National Organization for
Women, Stanford Chapter, is
co-sponsoring the petition, circulating
it among students.
Dr. Cross's complaints are based on
these figures: women comprise 30
percent of undergraduates, 15 per cent
of faculty. Of the 4 9 women faculty
members, 31 are assistant professors,
the lowest of three ranks. Women
comprise nearly 10 per cent of
Stanford's assistant professors, yet less
than two per cent of the full professors
are women. There are no women
department heads, few women in top
administrative positions, no dean of
women.
Years ago a housing limitation of
415 bed spaces barred equal enrollment
for women at Stanford. Co-educational
and off-campus housing has eliminated
that barrier.
Academic Barrier
An academic barrier has been raised

in its stead. The tendency of women to
choose certain majors—l 9 per cent of
all women choose English, 13 per cent
history, 12 per cent psychology, and
eight per cent modern European
languages—would require curriculum
and faculty adjustments which the
University currently is unwilling to
face.
And, although transfer students are
now being admitted on merit without
regard to sex, freshman classes are not.
This year's freshman class is composed
of 500 women and 890 men.
Admissions officers deny that sex
discrimination exists in the selection
process, explaining the two-to-one ratio
by the smaller proportion of women
applicants. They do admit, however,
that advance decisions are made by the
Provost's Office as to "desired
numbers" of men and women.
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education at Stanford -
termed the present policy regarding the
U9e of sex as a criterion for selection
"anachronistic and arbitrary." Yet that
committee also recommended that the
proportion of males be maintained at
60 to 75 per cent.

In explaining the scarcity of women
graduate students at Stanford,
admissions officials again point to the
small number of female applicants. The
absence of masters degree programs in
the humanities probably serves to
discourage more female applications.
Policies Not Responsive
Space limitations preclude part-time
or special student status, except in the
summer. Policies are not responsive to
the needs of married women, including
those who wish to transfer to Stanford
from another institution • because
husbands are members of the
University community. Many
departments set age limits on beginning
graduate students, intensifying the
problems for mothers wishing to
resume their education.
Yet the need for models for
undergraduate women is acute,
according to Dr. Alberta Siegel,
Associate Professor of Psychology at
Stanford. Talented and able women
whose family responsibilities are so
heavy as to allow study only as a
part-time basis could provide excellent
role models as they successfully
combine family and career goals.
Assistant - Provost Sally Mahoney
also emphasizes the importance of
diverse women models with whom
students can identify. "In the general
areas of student services," says Miss
Mahoney, "women must be visible in
responsible positions.
"There have been no particular
efforts at Stanford to respond to the
needs of women as a social minority
other than the appointment by former
President Pitzer of the Committee on
the Education and Employment of
Women in the University."
Discrimination at Stanford
Dr. Elizabeth Cohen of the
Education Department agrees that
there is a "good bit of discrimination
against women at Stanford, but it is
largely unconscious. People do not
understand, for example, why they feel
women are incapable of handling the
full professional role."
A woman, declares Professor Cohen,
must be over-qualified to get a position
in the university. Unable to play the
game of geographical mobility to the
same degree as their male counterparts,
women in universities may receive
lower salaries. Women are forced to
become generalists, capable of teaching

a variety of courses, flexible in their
careers.
Work Within System
The sociologist-turned-educator
believes in working within the system:
training as many women doctoral
candidates as possible (six of twelve
present candidates in the Education
Department are women), seeing her
students placed in appropriate jobs, and
lending moral support to women
students from all departments. Most
importantly, she must serve as a role
model, encouraging women to display
their abilities and to have confidence in
them.
Countless studies confirm that
students choose careers partly on the
basis of experience with individual
faculty members who are engaged in
them, according to Alberta Siegel in her
paper, "Education of Women at
Stanford." But most attractive women
on campus are secretaries and clerks.
"Education," notes Stanford history
professor Dr. Carl Degler, "must
prepare women for self-supporting
positions in society." Dr. Nancy Cross,
by ending the "ostensible historical
censorship" which has so long
suppressed the intent of Stanford's
founders, hopes to increase that
possibility in fairness to women and
men.
Women may be the fairer sex in
more ways than one. No longer content

Equity Action League. A Stanford
University alumnus, she contends that
discrimination against women does
indeed exist here. She has
originated a petition for "removing the
quota of half as many freshman women
as men, and other maldistributions in
admissions, scholarships, and faculty
appointments."
Equal Opportunity Demanded
Addressing her plea to the Board of
Trustees of Stanford, Dr. Cross urges
the execution of provision Fourth-16
of the Grant Founding and Endowing
The Leland Stanford Junior University,
"to afford equal facilities and give
equal advantages in the University to
both the sexes."
The National Organization for
Women, Stanford Chapter, is
co-sponsoring the petition, circulating
it among students.
Dr. Cross's complaints are based on
these figures: women comprise 30
percent of undergraduates, 15 per cent
of faculty. Of the 4 9 women faculty
members, 31 are assistant professors,
the lowest of three ranks. Women
comprise nearly 10 per cent of
Stanford's assistant professors, yet less
than two per cent of the full professors
are women. There are no women
department heads, few women in top
administrative positions, no dean of
women.
Years ago a housing limitation of
415 bed spaces barred equal enrollment
for women at Stanford. Co-educational
and off-campus housing has eliminated
that barrier.
Academic Barrier
An academic barrier has been raised

in its stead. The tendency of women to
choose certain majors—l 9 per cent of
all women choose English, 13 per cent
history, 12 per cent psychology, and
eight per cent modern European
languages—would require curriculum
and faculty adjustments which the
University currently is unwilling to
face.
And, although transfer students are
now being admitted on merit without
regard to sex, freshman classes are not.
This year's freshman class is composed
of 500 women and 890 men.
Admissions officers deny that sex
discrimination exists in the selection
process, explaining the two-to-one ratio
by the smaller proportion of women
applicants. They do admit, however,
that advance decisions are made by the
Provost's Office as to "desired
numbers" of men and women.
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education at Stanford -
termed the present policy regarding the
U9e of sex as a criterion for selection
"anachronistic and arbitrary." Yet that
committee also recommended that the
proportion of males be maintained at
60 to 75 per cent.

In explaining the scarcity of women
graduate students at Stanford,
admissions officials again point to the
small number of female applicants. The
absence of masters degree programs in
the humanities probably serves to
discourage more female applications.
Policies Not Responsive
Space limitations preclude part-time
or special student status, except in the
summer. Policies are not responsive to
the needs of married women, including
those who wish to transfer to Stanford
from another institution • because
husbands are members of the
University community. Many
departments set age limits on beginning
graduate students, intensifying the
problems for mothers wishing to
resume their education.
Yet the need for models for
undergraduate women is acute,
according to Dr. Alberta Siegel,
Associate Professor of Psychology at
Stanford. Talented and able women
whose family responsibilities are so
heavy as to allow study only as a
part-time basis could provide excellent
role models as they successfully
combine family and career goals.
Assistant - Provost Sally Mahoney
also emphasizes the importance of
diverse women models with whom
students can identify. "In the general
areas of student services," says Miss
Mahoney, "women must be visible in
responsible positions.
"There have been no particular
efforts at Stanford to respond to the
needs of women as a social minority
other than the appointment by former
President Pitzer of the Committee on
the Education and Employment of
Women in the University."
Discrimination at Stanford
Dr. Elizabeth Cohen of the
Education Department agrees that
there is a "good bit of discrimination
against women at Stanford, but it is
largely unconscious. People do not
understand, for example, why they feel
women are incapable of handling the
full professional role."
A woman, declares Professor Cohen,
must be over-qualified to get a position
in the university. Unable to play the
game of geographical mobility to the
same degree as their male counterparts,
women in universities may receive
lower salaries. Women are forced to
become generalists, capable of teaching

a variety of courses, flexible in their
careers.
Work Within System
The sociologist-turned-educator
believes in working within the system:
training as many women doctoral
candidates as possible (six of twelve
present candidates in the Education
Department are women), seeing her
students placed in appropriate jobs, and
lending moral support to women
students from all departments. Most
importantly, she must serve as a role
model, encouraging women to display
their abilities and to have confidence in
them.
Countless studies confirm that
students choose careers partly on the
basis of experience with individual
faculty members who are engaged in
them, according to Alberta Siegel in her
paper, "Education of Women at
Stanford." But most attractive women
on campus are secretaries and clerks.
"Education," notes Stanford history
professor Dr. Carl Degler, "must
prepare women for self-supporting
positions in society." Dr. Nancy Cross,
by ending the "ostensible historical
censorship" which has so long
suppressed the intent of Stanford's
founders, hopes to increase that
possibility in fairness to women and
men.
Women may be the fairer sex in
more ways than one. No longer content
to accept socially defined sex roles,
many women wish, in fairness to both
women and men, to end institutional
discrimination and to humanize society
in the process.
According to Science Magazine, 4 3
colleges and universities have been
charged with discriminatory
employment practices against women.
The Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare Office of Contract
Compliance, Civil Rights Division, has
been asked to begin an immediate
"class" action and compliance review
of colleges charged with discrimination
in admissions, financial help for
graduate study, hiring practices,
promotion, and salary differentials.

percent of undergraduates, 15 per cent
of faculty. Of the 4 9 women faculty
members, 31 are assistant professors,
the lowest of three ranks. Women
comprise nearly 10 per cent of
Stanford's assistant professors, yet less
than two per cent of the full professors
are women. There are no women
department heads, few women in top
administrative positions, no dean of
women.
Years ago a housing limitation of
415 bed spaces barred equal enrollment
for women at Stanford. Co-educational
and off-campus housing has eliminated
that barrier.
Academic Barrier
An academic barrier has been raised

in its stead. The tendency of women to
choose certain majors—l 9 per cent of
all women choose English, 13 per cent
history, 12 per cent psychology, and
eight per cent modern European
languages—would require curriculum
and faculty adjustments which the
University currently is unwilling to
face.
And, although transfer students are
now being admitted on merit without
regard to sex, freshman classes are not.
This year's freshman class is composed
of 500 women and 890 men.
Admissions officers deny that sex
discrimination exists in the selection
process, explaining the two-to-one ratio
by the smaller proportion of women
applicants. They do admit, however,
that advance decisions are made by the
Provost's Office as to "desired
numbers" of men and women.
The Steering Committee of the
Study of Education at Stanford -
termed the present policy regarding the
U9e of sex as a criterion for selection
"anachronistic and arbitrary." Yet that
committee also recommended that the
proportion of males be maintained at
60 to 75 per cent.

In explaining the scarcity of women
graduate students at Stanford,
admissions officials again point to the
small number of female applicants. The
absence of masters degree programs in
the humanities probably serves to
discourage more female applications.
Policies Not Responsive
Space limitations preclude part-time
or special student status, except in the
summer. Policies are not responsive to
the needs of married women, including
those who wish to transfer to Stanford
from another institution • because
husbands are members of the
University community. Many
departments set age limits on beginning
graduate students, intensifying the
problems for mothers wishing to
resume their education.
Yet the need for models for
undergraduate women is acute,
according to Dr. Alberta Siegel,
Associate Professor of Psychology at
Stanford. Talented and able women
whose family responsibilities are so
heavy as to allow study only as a
part-time basis could provide excellent
role models as they successfully
combine family and career goals.
Assistant - Provost Sally Mahoney
also emphasizes the importance of
diverse women models with whom
students can identify. "In the general
areas of student services," says Miss
Mahoney, "women must be visible in
responsible positions.
"There have been no particular
efforts at Stanford to respond to the
needs of women as a social minority
other than the appointment by former
President Pitzer of the Committee on
the Education and Employment of
Women in the University."
Discrimination at Stanford
Dr. Elizabeth Cohen of the
Education Department agrees that
there is a "good bit of discrimination
against women at Stanford, but it is
largely unconscious. People do not
understand, for example, why they feel
women are incapable of handling the
full professional role."
A woman, declares Professor Cohen,
must be over-qualified to get a position
in the university. Unable to play the
game of geographical mobility to the
same degree as their male counterparts,
women in universities may receive
lower salaries. Women are forced to
become generalists, capable of teaching

a variety of courses, flexible in their
careers.
Work Within System
The sociologist-turned-educator
believes in working within the system:
training as many women doctoral
candidates as possible (six of twelve
present candidates in the Education
Department are women), seeing her
students placed in appropriate jobs, and
lending moral support to women
students from all departments. Most
importantly, she must serve as a role
model, encouraging women to display
their abilities and to have confidence in
them.
Countless studies confirm that
students choose careers partly on the
basis of experience with individual
faculty members who are engaged in
them, according to Alberta Siegel in her
paper, "Education of Women at
Stanford." But most attractive women
on campus are secretaries and clerks.
"Education," notes Stanford history
professor Dr. Carl Degler, "must
prepare women for self-supporting
positions in society." Dr. Nancy Cross,
by ending the "ostensible historical
censorship" which has so long
suppressed the intent of Stanford's
founders, hopes to increase that
possibility in fairness to women and
men.
Women may be the fairer sex in
more ways than one. No longer content
to accept socially defined sex roles,
many women wish, in fairness to both
women and men, to end institutional
discrimination and to humanize society
in the process.
According to Science Magazine, 4 3
colleges and universities have been
charged with discriminatory
employment practices against women.
The Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare Office of Contract
Compliance, Civil Rights Division, has
been asked to begin an immediate
"class" action and compliance review
of colleges charged with discrimination
in admissions, financial help for
graduate study, hiring practices,
promotion, and salary differentials.

"Women are second-class citizens on
many a campus," declares Dr. Nancy E.
Dowding, president of the Women's
Equity Action League. A Stanford
University alumnus, she contends that
discrimination against women does
indeed exist here. She has
originated a petition for "removing the
quota of half as many freshman women
as men, and other maldistributions in
admissions, scholarships, and faculty
appointments."
Equal Opportunity Demanded
Addressing her plea to the Board of
Trustees of Stanford, Dr. Cross urges
the execution of provision Fourth-16
of the Grant Founding and Endowing
The Leland Stanford Junior University,
"to afford equal facilities and give
equal advantages in the University to
both the sexes."
The National Organization for
Women, Stanford Chapter, is
co-sponsoring the petition, circulating
it among students.
