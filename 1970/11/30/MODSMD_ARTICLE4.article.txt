# Today In The 'Daily'

### 
Thirty-nine years ago, someone dubbed 'The King' was
spewing forth a Daily column entitled "Cabbages and Things."
In a moment of divine inspiration, he penned the following
gem: "The football season is a good time to check up on the
feminine viewpoint. Can a forty-inch chest hold its own against
a forty-horsepower chummy roadster?"
We're at a total loss to figure out just what 'The King' had in
mind, but we assume it is moderately obscene. If any of you
