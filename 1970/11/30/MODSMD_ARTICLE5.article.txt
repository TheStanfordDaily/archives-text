### 
South Vietnam's controversial
vice-president, Nguyen Cao Ky will
arrive in San Francisco Tuesday
morning, as he brings to a close his two
and a half week "unofficial" visit to
this country.
A large peace demonstration has
been planned outside the Fairmont
Hotel to greet the South Vietnamese

leader, who is scheduled to address the
Commonwealth Club in the Fairmont's
Grand Ballroom tomorrow at noon.
Howard Wallace, spokesman for the
Anti-War Coalition which is sponsoring
the peace rally was quoted in
Saturday's Chronicle as saying that he
expected a minimum of 5,000 people
at the rally and that the figure "might
go as high as 20,000 people."
Yet Saturday night, Wallace said he
was not sure how many people would
show up, but expected that it would be
"the biggest demonstration Ky has yet
seen in this country."
Vice-president Ky's stay in this
country has been spent touring military
schools where 2700 Vietnamese
soldiers are currently being trained and
in conversations with the nation's
leaders.
The rally has been scheduled to
begin at 11:30 and Wallace says it will
consist of speeches either by
Vietnamese 1 or American war veterans.
Activities here for the
demonstration have consisted of
leafletting and plans to meet at the Palo
Alto train station at 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow to take the train to the rally.
Peace organizations in the Palo Alto
community have also chartered buses
which wili leave for the rally from in
front of the School at 9 45 .
