## Ky Symbol Of War Michael sweeney 
### 
Nguyen Cao Ky has become a symbol of what
the United States is fighting for in Vietnam. He
rose to power on the coat tails of the U.S.
escalation.
Ky will speak before the Commonwealth Club
at high noon on Tuesday, December 1. He will be
greeted by anti-war demonstrators surrounding the
Fairmont Hotel. It promises to be one of the
biggest demonstrations—perhaps riots—in San
Francisco this year.
Recently some corporate leaders have given up
hope that victory in Vietnam can be won at a
tolerable cost. Ky has come to San Francisco to
urge them to stick to their guns.
Years ago, the shoot-from-the-lip mentality of
Nguyen Cao Ky won him the nickname of "The
Cowboy." He was born in 1930 in what is now
North Vietnam. After enlisting in the native army
being set up by the French in 1948 , Ky was sent
to !h>ance to train as a pilot. He returned and flew
missions against the Vietnamese Independence
Movement (Vietminh).
After the Vietminh smashed the French at
Dienbienphu in 1 954 , the French sent Ky to
Algeria where he flew bombing missions against
the Algerian independence fighters.
The young pilot Ky was sent to Maxwell Air
Base in Alabama for training in 1956, the
beginning of his close relationship with the U.S.
military. Ky returned to South Vietnam to take
charge of the secret, CIA-organized "black flights"
which parachuted saboteurs into North Vietnam.
As head of the South Vietnamese 43 rd Air
Transport Group from 1959 to 1962, Ky
conducted the "black flights" with a group of
American CIA pilots known as the "Dirty Thirty."
Opium
As revealed before the Gruening Senate
Subcommittee in 1968, Ky would stop in Laos on
the return flight from North Vietnam to pick up
opium, which was processed into heroin and
smuggled out of Saigon.
This swashbuckling gangster, a frequent patron
of Saigon nightclubs, wasn't taken very seriously
in Saigon, but the chaos that developed in the
corrupt Diem regime ga v e him his chance to rise to
power. By 1963 the National Liberation Front
(NLF) threatened to sweep away the whole rotten
nest of CIA agents, opium smugglers, secret police
and U.S.-paid generals.
To head off complete defeat, the U.S. gave the
go-ahead to a military coup that deposed and
murdered Diem in November, 1963. Ky became
commander of the Air Force. In an interview with
a British journalist in October, 1 964, Ky said his
"only" hero was Adolph Hitler.
Bombing
Cowboy Ky was soon calling for the bombing
of North Vietnam "I cannot assure that all of
North Vietnam would be destroyed, but Hanoi
would certainly be destroyed," he said in 19 64 .
Bombing the north did nothing to stop the
growth of the popular uprising in the south. As the
NLF grew stronger, the Saigon government
trembled, collapsed nine times in two years from
1963-65. Every time a civilian politician took
leadership in Saigon, he showed a willingness to
negotiate with the NLF and end the killing. So the
hard-line generals, with U.S. approval, would stage
a coup.
With each new coup, Marshall Ky climbed a
'little higher in the group of ruling generals, and
finally became premier after a coup in June, 1 965.
The U.S. needed the Cowboy, but the Cowboy
needed the U.S. even more. Without the influx of
U.S. troops, Ky's regime would have collapsed
overnight.
Iron Hand
Ky promised to rule with an "iron hand." One
of his first acts was to cut civil service salaries
while doubling the pay of the army. He spent U.S.

aid funds on a $500,000 jet for his personal use,
complete with bar, TV, and stereophonic sound.
Among his many sources of income was a 25
percent rake-off from the profits of Saigon's
PhuTho racetrack.
When Saigon newspapers protested against
some of Ky's dictatorial measures., he closed them
down for a month. Ky pledged to "shoot all
corrupt officers, cowardly soldiers and
speculators." (He did not, of course, shoot
himself.)
President Johnson liked Ky just fine. LBJ
summoned the Cowboy to a Honolulu conference
in 1966 and embraced him as a "brother in arms"
who would work for a "just and honorable peace."-
When Buddhists, students and some army units
rose up against Ky in 1966 and seized Danang and.
Hue, U.S. transport planes shipped pro-Ky troops
to the rescue. Ky's planes strafed the Buddhist
pagodas. The rebellion was crushed.
China
By this time the U.S. had 300,000 troops in
South Vietnam. Ky called for a ground invasion of
North Vietnam, even if it meant war with
Communist China. "Sooner or later, we as free
men have to face the Chinese Communists," said
Ky. A harsh reprimand from the U.S. made Ky
issue a retraction later on.
To Ky, the NLF was nothing but "murderers
and criminals." He swore he would never negotiate
with them, and would rather die than 9ee the
"death" of his country under revolutionary
socialism. Ky did, however, take the precautionary
measure of moving his personal fortune abroad for
safekeeping in case he had to make a quick exit.
As the anti-war movement grew in the United
States in 1967 , Lyndon Johnson felt some
pressure to make the Saigon dictatorship appear
more democratic. The Saigon generals were
persuaded to hold elections for a "civilian"
government. A power struggle developed to
determine which general would be the military's
candidate for president. Ky lost out to General
Nguyen Van Thieu and had to accept the Vice
Presidential nomination. Ky appeared at only one
campaign rally, in Hue, where he was drowned out
by chants of "Lanh Dao Cowboy!"— Down with
the Cowboy.
In the "election" of September, 1967 , the
Ky-controlled national police supervised the vote
counting. The winners were (surprise!) Thieu and
Ky. The runner-up candidate, Truong Dinh Dzu,
was later imprisoned.
With a "democratic" government installed, the
U.S. proceeded to destroy Vietnam in order to
savajt. The Tet offensive of 1968 proved that the
NLF was stronger than ever and that "pacifiation"
was impossible.
Indiscriminate bombing and shelling was
directed at the rural population. B-5 2 bombers
tore 3.5 million craters into the countryside by
1969. The Saigon generals went along with this
genocide. With their own economy destroyed,
their soldiers deserting by thousands, and their
people against them, Thieu and Ky could only
cling to their U.S. masters.
Ky continues to be the Cowboy. He
enthusiastically backed the South Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia after the U.S. gave the go
ahead. With his usual insensitivity to the U.S.
political situation, Ky accepted an invitation to
speak at a "Victory in Vietnam" rally at the
Washington monument October 3, sponsored by
right-wing Rev. Carl Mclntire. After the Yippies
had announced that the rally would be a "free fire
zone," the White House told Ky not to come.
Now the Cowboy is touring the United States
with the same old message: fight to the end in
Vietnam. To the Cowboy, anything is better than
an NLF victory in South Vietnam—even the total
destruction of the land and people.

American CIA pilots known as the "Dirty Thirty."
Opium
As revealed before the Gruening Senate
Subcommittee in 1968, Ky would stop in Laos on
the return flight from North Vietnam to pick up
opium, which was processed into heroin and
smuggled out of Saigon.
This swashbuckling gangster, a frequent patron
of Saigon nightclubs, wasn't taken very seriously
in Saigon, but the chaos that developed in the
corrupt Diem regime ga v e him his chance to rise to
power. By 1963 the National Liberation Front
(NLF) threatened to sweep away the whole rotten
nest of CIA agents, opium smugglers, secret police
and U.S.-paid generals.
To head off complete defeat, the U.S. gave the
go-ahead to a military coup that deposed and
murdered Diem in November, 1963. Ky became
commander of the Air Force. In an interview with
a British journalist in October, 1 964, Ky said his
"only" hero was Adolph Hitler.
Bombing
Cowboy Ky was soon calling for the bombing
of North Vietnam "I cannot assure that all of
North Vietnam would be destroyed, but Hanoi
would certainly be destroyed," he said in 19 64 .
Bombing the north did nothing to stop the
growth of the popular uprising in the south. As the
NLF grew stronger, the Saigon government
trembled, collapsed nine times in two years from
1963-65. Every time a civilian politician took
leadership in Saigon, he showed a willingness to
negotiate with the NLF and end the killing. So the
hard-line generals, with U.S. approval, would stage
a coup.
With each new coup, Marshall Ky climbed a
'little higher in the group of ruling generals, and
finally became premier after a coup in June, 1 965.
The U.S. needed the Cowboy, but the Cowboy
needed the U.S. even more. Without the influx of
U.S. troops, Ky's regime would have collapsed
overnight.
Iron Hand
Ky promised to rule with an "iron hand." One
of his first acts was to cut civil service salaries
while doubling the pay of the army. He spent U.S.

aid funds on a $500,000 jet for his personal use,
complete with bar, TV, and stereophonic sound.
Among his many sources of income was a 25
percent rake-off from the profits of Saigon's
PhuTho racetrack.
When Saigon newspapers protested against
some of Ky's dictatorial measures., he closed them
down for a month. Ky pledged to "shoot all
corrupt officers, cowardly soldiers and
speculators." (He did not, of course, shoot
himself.)
President Johnson liked Ky just fine. LBJ
summoned the Cowboy to a Honolulu conference
in 1966 and embraced him as a "brother in arms"
who would work for a "just and honorable peace."-
When Buddhists, students and some army units
rose up against Ky in 1966 and seized Danang and.
Hue, U.S. transport planes shipped pro-Ky troops
to the rescue. Ky's planes strafed the Buddhist
pagodas. The rebellion was crushed.
China
By this time the U.S. had 300,000 troops in
South Vietnam. Ky called for a ground invasion of
North Vietnam, even if it meant war with
Communist China. "Sooner or later, we as free
men have to face the Chinese Communists," said
Ky. A harsh reprimand from the U.S. made Ky
issue a retraction later on.
To Ky, the NLF was nothing but "murderers
and criminals." He swore he would never negotiate
with them, and would rather die than 9ee the
"death" of his country under revolutionary
socialism. Ky did, however, take the precautionary
measure of moving his personal fortune abroad for
safekeeping in case he had to make a quick exit.
As the anti-war movement grew in the United
States in 1967 , Lyndon Johnson felt some
pressure to make the Saigon dictatorship appear
more democratic. The Saigon generals were
persuaded to hold elections for a "civilian"
government. A power struggle developed to
determine which general would be the military's
candidate for president. Ky lost out to General
Nguyen Van Thieu and had to accept the Vice
Presidential nomination. Ky appeared at only one
campaign rally, in Hue, where he was drowned out
by chants of "Lanh Dao Cowboy!"— Down with
the Cowboy.
In the "election" of September, 1967 , the
Ky-controlled national police supervised the vote
counting. The winners were (surprise!) Thieu and
Ky. The runner-up candidate, Truong Dinh Dzu,
was later imprisoned.
With a "democratic" government installed, the
U.S. proceeded to destroy Vietnam in order to
savajt. The Tet offensive of 1968 proved that the
NLF was stronger than ever and that "pacifiation"
was impossible.
Indiscriminate bombing and shelling was
directed at the rural population. B-5 2 bombers
tore 3.5 million craters into the countryside by
1969. The Saigon generals went along with this
genocide. With their own economy destroyed,
their soldiers deserting by thousands, and their
people against them, Thieu and Ky could only
cling to their U.S. masters.
Ky continues to be the Cowboy. He
enthusiastically backed the South Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia after the U.S. gave the go
ahead. With his usual insensitivity to the U.S.
political situation, Ky accepted an invitation to
speak at a "Victory in Vietnam" rally at the
Washington monument October 3, sponsored by
right-wing Rev. Carl Mclntire. After the Yippies
had announced that the rally would be a "free fire
zone," the White House told Ky not to come.
Now the Cowboy is touring the United States
with the same old message: fight to the end in
Vietnam. To the Cowboy, anything is better than
an NLF victory in South Vietnam—even the total
destruction of the land and people.
Lanh Dao Cowboy!
Nguyen Cao Ky has become a symbol of what
the United States is fighting for in Vietnam. He
rose to power on the coat tails of the U.S.
escalation.
Ky will speak before the Commonwealth Club
at high noon on Tuesday, December 1. He will be
greeted by anti-war demonstrators surrounding the
Fairmont Hotel. It promises to be one of the
biggest demonstrations—perhaps riots—in San
Francisco this year.
Recently some corporate leaders have given up
hope that victory in Vietnam can be won at a
tolerable cost. Ky has come to San Francisco to
urge them to stick to their guns.
Years ago, the shoot-from-the-lip mentality of
Nguyen Cao Ky won him the nickname of "The
Cowboy." He was born in 1930 in what is now
North Vietnam. After enlisting in the native army
being set up by the French in 1948 , Ky was sent
to !h>ance to train as a pilot. He returned and flew
missions against the Vietnamese Independence
Movement (Vietminh).
After the Vietminh smashed the French at
Dienbienphu in 1 954 , the French sent Ky to
Algeria where he flew bombing missions against
the Algerian independence fighters.
The young pilot Ky was sent to Maxwell Air
Base in Alabama for training in 1956, the
beginning of his close relationship with the U.S.
military. Ky returned to South Vietnam to take
charge of the secret, CIA-organized "black flights"
which parachuted saboteurs into North Vietnam.
As head of the South Vietnamese 43 rd Air
Transport Group from 1959 to 1962, Ky
conducted the "black flights" with a group of

With each new coup, Marshall Ky climbed a
'little higher in the group of ruling generals, and
finally became premier after a coup in June, 1 965.
The U.S. needed the Cowboy, but the Cowboy
needed the U.S. even more. Without the influx of
U.S. troops, Ky's regime would have collapsed
overnight.
Iron Hand
Ky promised to rule with an "iron hand." One
of his first acts was to cut civil service salaries
while doubling the pay of the army. He spent U.S.

aid funds on a $500,000 jet for his personal use,
complete with bar, TV, and stereophonic sound.
Among his many sources of income was a 25
percent rake-off from the profits of Saigon's
PhuTho racetrack.
When Saigon newspapers protested against
some of Ky's dictatorial measures., he closed them
down for a month. Ky pledged to "shoot all
corrupt officers, cowardly soldiers and
speculators." (He did not, of course, shoot
himself.)
President Johnson liked Ky just fine. LBJ
summoned the Cowboy to a Honolulu conference
in 1966 and embraced him as a "brother in arms"
who would work for a "just and honorable peace."-
When Buddhists, students and some army units
rose up against Ky in 1966 and seized Danang and.
Hue, U.S. transport planes shipped pro-Ky troops
to the rescue. Ky's planes strafed the Buddhist
pagodas. The rebellion was crushed.
China
By this time the U.S. had 300,000 troops in
South Vietnam. Ky called for a ground invasion of
North Vietnam, even if it meant war with
Communist China. "Sooner or later, we as free
men have to face the Chinese Communists," said
Ky. A harsh reprimand from the U.S. made Ky
issue a retraction later on.
To Ky, the NLF was nothing but "murderers
and criminals." He swore he would never negotiate
with them, and would rather die than 9ee the
"death" of his country under revolutionary
socialism. Ky did, however, take the precautionary
measure of moving his personal fortune abroad for
safekeeping in case he had to make a quick exit.
As the anti-war movement grew in the United
States in 1967 , Lyndon Johnson felt some
pressure to make the Saigon dictatorship appear
more democratic. The Saigon generals were
persuaded to hold elections for a "civilian"
government. A power struggle developed to
determine which general would be the military's
candidate for president. Ky lost out to General
Nguyen Van Thieu and had to accept the Vice
Presidential nomination. Ky appeared at only one
campaign rally, in Hue, where he was drowned out
by chants of "Lanh Dao Cowboy!"— Down with
the Cowboy.
In the "election" of September, 1967 , the
Ky-controlled national police supervised the vote
counting. The winners were (surprise!) Thieu and
Ky. The runner-up candidate, Truong Dinh Dzu,
was later imprisoned.
With a "democratic" government installed, the
U.S. proceeded to destroy Vietnam in order to
savajt. The Tet offensive of 1968 proved that the
NLF was stronger than ever and that "pacifiation"
was impossible.
Indiscriminate bombing and shelling was
directed at the rural population. B-5 2 bombers
tore 3.5 million craters into the countryside by
1969. The Saigon generals went along with this
genocide. With their own economy destroyed,
their soldiers deserting by thousands, and their
people against them, Thieu and Ky could only
cling to their U.S. masters.
Ky continues to be the Cowboy. He
enthusiastically backed the South Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia after the U.S. gave the go
ahead. With his usual insensitivity to the U.S.
political situation, Ky accepted an invitation to
speak at a "Victory in Vietnam" rally at the
Washington monument October 3, sponsored by
right-wing Rev. Carl Mclntire. After the Yippies
had announced that the rally would be a "free fire
zone," the White House told Ky not to come.
Now the Cowboy is touring the United States
with the same old message: fight to the end in
Vietnam. To the Cowboy, anything is better than
an NLF victory in South Vietnam—even the total
destruction of the land and people.
Lanh Dao Cowboy!
Nguyen Cao Ky has become a symbol of what
the United States is fighting for in Vietnam. He
rose to power on the coat tails of the U.S.
escalation.
Ky will speak before the Commonwealth Club
at high noon on Tuesday, December 1. He will be
greeted by anti-war demonstrators surrounding the
Fairmont Hotel. It promises to be one of the
biggest demonstrations—perhaps riots—in San
Francisco this year.
Recently some corporate leaders have given up
hope that victory in Vietnam can be won at a
tolerable cost. Ky has come to San Francisco to
urge them to stick to their guns.
Years ago, the shoot-from-the-lip mentality of
Nguyen Cao Ky won him the nickname of "The
Cowboy." He was born in 1930 in what is now
North Vietnam. After enlisting in the native army
being set up by the French in 1948 , Ky was sent
to !h>ance to train as a pilot. He returned and flew
missions against the Vietnamese Independence
Movement (Vietminh).
After the Vietminh smashed the French at
Dienbienphu in 1 954 , the French sent Ky to
Algeria where he flew bombing missions against
the Algerian independence fighters.
The young pilot Ky was sent to Maxwell Air
Base in Alabama for training in 1956, the
beginning of his close relationship with the U.S.
military. Ky returned to South Vietnam to take
charge of the secret, CIA-organized "black flights"
which parachuted saboteurs into North Vietnam.
As head of the South Vietnamese 43 rd Air
Transport Group from 1959 to 1962, Ky
conducted the "black flights" with a group of
American CIA pilots known as the "Dirty Thirty."
Opium
As revealed before the Gruening Senate
Subcommittee in 1968, Ky would stop in Laos on
the return flight from North Vietnam to pick up
opium, which was processed into heroin and
smuggled out of Saigon.
This swashbuckling gangster, a frequent patron
of Saigon nightclubs, wasn't taken very seriously
in Saigon, but the chaos that developed in the
corrupt Diem regime ga v e him his chance to rise to
power. By 1963 the National Liberation Front
(NLF) threatened to sweep away the whole rotten
nest of CIA agents, opium smugglers, secret police
and U.S.-paid generals.
To head off complete defeat, the U.S. gave the
go-ahead to a military coup that deposed and
murdered Diem in November, 1963. Ky became
commander of the Air Force. In an interview with
a British journalist in October, 1 964, Ky said his
"only" hero was Adolph Hitler.
Bombing
Cowboy Ky was soon calling for the bombing
of North Vietnam "I cannot assure that all of
North Vietnam would be destroyed, but Hanoi
would certainly be destroyed," he said in 19 64 .
Bombing the north did nothing to stop the
growth of the popular uprising in the south. As the
NLF grew stronger, the Saigon government
trembled, collapsed nine times in two years from
1963-65. Every time a civilian politician took
leadership in Saigon, he showed a willingness to
negotiate with the NLF and end the killing. So the
hard-line generals, with U.S. approval, would stage
a coup.
With each new coup, Marshall Ky climbed a
'little higher in the group of ruling generals, and
finally became premier after a coup in June, 1 965.

North Vietnam, even if it meant war with
Communist China. "Sooner or later, we as free
men have to face the Chinese Communists," said
Ky. A harsh reprimand from the U.S. made Ky
issue a retraction later on.
To Ky, the NLF was nothing but "murderers
and criminals." He swore he would never negotiate
with them, and would rather die than 9ee the
"death" of his country under revolutionary
socialism. Ky did, however, take the precautionary
measure of moving his personal fortune abroad for
safekeeping in case he had to make a quick exit.
As the anti-war movement grew in the United
States in 1967 , Lyndon Johnson felt some
pressure to make the Saigon dictatorship appear
more democratic. The Saigon generals were
persuaded to hold elections for a "civilian"
government. A power struggle developed to
determine which general would be the military's
candidate for president. Ky lost out to General
Nguyen Van Thieu and had to accept the Vice
Presidential nomination. Ky appeared at only one
campaign rally, in Hue, where he was drowned out
by chants of "Lanh Dao Cowboy!"— Down with
the Cowboy.
In the "election" of September, 1967 , the
Ky-controlled national police supervised the vote
counting. The winners were (surprise!) Thieu and
Ky. The runner-up candidate, Truong Dinh Dzu,
was later imprisoned.
With a "democratic" government installed, the
U.S. proceeded to destroy Vietnam in order to
savajt. The Tet offensive of 1968 proved that the
NLF was stronger than ever and that "pacifiation"
was impossible.
Indiscriminate bombing and shelling was
directed at the rural population. B-5 2 bombers
tore 3.5 million craters into the countryside by
1969. The Saigon generals went along with this
genocide. With their own economy destroyed,
their soldiers deserting by thousands, and their
people against them, Thieu and Ky could only
cling to their U.S. masters.
Ky continues to be the Cowboy. He
enthusiastically backed the South Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia after the U.S. gave the go
ahead. With his usual insensitivity to the U.S.
political situation, Ky accepted an invitation to
speak at a "Victory in Vietnam" rally at the
Washington monument October 3, sponsored by
right-wing Rev. Carl Mclntire. After the Yippies
had announced that the rally would be a "free fire
zone," the White House told Ky not to come.
Now the Cowboy is touring the United States
with the same old message: fight to the end in
Vietnam. To the Cowboy, anything is better than
an NLF victory in South Vietnam—even the total
destruction of the land and people.
Lanh Dao Cowboy!
Nguyen Cao Ky has become a symbol of what
the United States is fighting for in Vietnam. He
rose to power on the coat tails of the U.S.
escalation.
Ky will speak before the Commonwealth Club
at high noon on Tuesday, December 1. He will be
greeted by anti-war demonstrators surrounding the
Fairmont Hotel. It promises to be one of the
biggest demonstrations—perhaps riots—in San
Francisco this year.
Recently some corporate leaders have given up
hope that victory in Vietnam can be won at a
tolerable cost. Ky has come to San Francisco to
urge them to stick to their guns.
Years ago, the shoot-from-the-lip mentality of
Nguyen Cao Ky won him the nickname of "The
Cowboy." He was born in 1930 in what is now
North Vietnam. After enlisting in the native army
being set up by the French in 1948 , Ky was sent
to !h>ance to train as a pilot. He returned and flew
missions against the Vietnamese Independence
Movement (Vietminh).
After the Vietminh smashed the French at
Dienbienphu in 1 954 , the French sent Ky to
Algeria where he flew bombing missions against
the Algerian independence fighters.
The young pilot Ky was sent to Maxwell Air
Base in Alabama for training in 1956, the
beginning of his close relationship with the U.S.
military. Ky returned to South Vietnam to take
charge of the secret, CIA-organized "black flights"
which parachuted saboteurs into North Vietnam.
As head of the South Vietnamese 43 rd Air
Transport Group from 1959 to 1962, Ky
conducted the "black flights" with a group of
American CIA pilots known as the "Dirty Thirty."
Opium
As revealed before the Gruening Senate
Subcommittee in 1968, Ky would stop in Laos on
the return flight from North Vietnam to pick up
opium, which was processed into heroin and
smuggled out of Saigon.
This swashbuckling gangster, a frequent patron
of Saigon nightclubs, wasn't taken very seriously
in Saigon, but the chaos that developed in the
corrupt Diem regime ga v e him his chance to rise to
power. By 1963 the National Liberation Front
(NLF) threatened to sweep away the whole rotten
nest of CIA agents, opium smugglers, secret police
and U.S.-paid generals.
To head off complete defeat, the U.S. gave the
go-ahead to a military coup that deposed and
murdered Diem in November, 1963. Ky became
commander of the Air Force. In an interview with
a British journalist in October, 1 964, Ky said his
"only" hero was Adolph Hitler.
Bombing
Cowboy Ky was soon calling for the bombing
of North Vietnam "I cannot assure that all of
North Vietnam would be destroyed, but Hanoi
would certainly be destroyed," he said in 19 64 .
Bombing the north did nothing to stop the
growth of the popular uprising in the south. As the
NLF grew stronger, the Saigon government
trembled, collapsed nine times in two years from
1963-65. Every time a civilian politician took
leadership in Saigon, he showed a willingness to
negotiate with the NLF and end the killing. So the
hard-line generals, with U.S. approval, would stage
a coup.
With each new coup, Marshall Ky climbed a
'little higher in the group of ruling generals, and
finally became premier after a coup in June, 1 965.
The U.S. needed the Cowboy, but the Cowboy
needed the U.S. even more. Without the influx of
U.S. troops, Ky's regime would have collapsed
overnight.
Iron Hand
Ky promised to rule with an "iron hand." One
of his first acts was to cut civil service salaries
while doubling the pay of the army. He spent U.S.

aid funds on a $500,000 jet for his personal use,
complete with bar, TV, and stereophonic sound.
Among his many sources of income was a 25
percent rake-off from the profits of Saigon's
PhuTho racetrack.
When Saigon newspapers protested against
some of Ky's dictatorial measures., he closed them
down for a month. Ky pledged to "shoot all
corrupt officers, cowardly soldiers and
speculators." (He did not, of course, shoot
himself.)
President Johnson liked Ky just fine. LBJ
summoned the Cowboy to a Honolulu conference
in 1966 and embraced him as a "brother in arms"
who would work for a "just and honorable peace."-
When Buddhists, students and some army units
rose up against Ky in 1966 and seized Danang and.
Hue, U.S. transport planes shipped pro-Ky troops
to the rescue. Ky's planes strafed the Buddhist
pagodas. The rebellion was crushed.
China
By this time the U.S. had 300,000 troops in
South Vietnam. Ky called for a ground invasion of
North Vietnam, even if it meant war with
Communist China. "Sooner or later, we as free
men have to face the Chinese Communists," said
Ky. A harsh reprimand from the U.S. made Ky
issue a retraction later on.
