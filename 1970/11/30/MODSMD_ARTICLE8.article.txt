# Concert Thursday
## 
### 
For the second time this
quarter, the ASSU special events
board is sponsoring the
unprecedented appearance of a
fantastic pop group. This time it's
the Moody Blues, making their
first and only appearance this year
in the Bay Area.
Stanford is one of only two
colleges in the nation to be
presenting the group on campus,

and their eastern tour this
September is rumored to have
been a sellout according to Adam
Levin, member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents. The
Moodys are bringing a new group
with them, Trapeze. The two will
appear at Maples Pavilion on
Thursday, December 3 at 8 p.m.
Student tickets are currently
on sale for $2 .75 each.


MOODY BLUESâ€”Special Events is sponsoring this rock group in
concert Thursday night at 8. Tickets are $2.7 5 for students.
