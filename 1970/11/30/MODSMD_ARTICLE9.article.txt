New Attack
SAIGON — An American bomber attacked a
radar-controlled anti-aircraft position inside North
Vietnam on Monday, the U.S. Command announced.
The command said in a communique the gun site
was located 5 1 /2 miles north of the Laotian border.
It termed the raid "protective reaction," which it
called "the inherent right of self-defense."
Sources said the anti-aircraft gun did not fire on the
American fighter-bomber, an Air Force FlO5
Thunderchief, but threatened the supersonic jet and
other U.S. aircraft by zeroing in with radar in
preparation for firing.
Crash Probe
ANCHORAGE, Alaska - Federal investigators checked
reports yesterday of a vibration problem, a possible
fuel or oil leak and a tire blowout on the chartered,
Vietnam-bound DC 8 that crashed here, killing 4 7 of
the 229 persons aboard.
The investigators-one member of the National
Transportation Safety Board and eight board specialists
in aircraft accidents said the reports were unconfirmed.

Members of the team said they expected to be in
Anchorage a week or longer. No public hearings were
planned and most of the material gathered will be
returned to Washington, D.C., for evaluation.
"We will determine the probable cause," said Isabel
Burgess, a member of the board. "It may be hard, but
we will do it."
Traffic Toll
The traffic death toll across the nation for the
Thanksgiving holiday climbed to 58 6 Sunday.
Inclement weather caused iced and slippery roads in
many sections and contributed to the rising fatality
rate.
The count of deaths began at 6 p.m., local time,
Wednesday and ends at midnight Sunday.

LOS ANGELES — Gov. Reagan, saying citizens don't
have a "right" to share in this nation's wealth, has
affirmed his opposition to a national guaranteed annual
wage program for welfare recipients. "I believe the

government of the United States is supposed to
promote the general welfare," Reagan said. "I don't
believe it is supposed to provide it."
The governor made his comments in the Public
Broadcasting Service show, "The Advocates," which
will be telecast by KCET, Los Angeles, and other PBS
stations Tuesday.
Joining Reagan in opposing a $2,4 00 annual wage
for welfare family of four were Roger Freeman, a
researcher at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, and
William Rusher, publisher of the National Review.
Speaking in favor of a guaranteed income plan were
Howard Miller, a USC law professor, Texas state Sen.
Barbara Jordan and Theodore Marmor, associate
director of the University of Minnesota School of
Public Affairs.
Reagan said he thought any minimum income
program would increase rather than reduce welfare
bureaucracy and that welfare costs would escalate
sharply.
"I have to say no," the governor added, "if you ask
me if anyone is morally entitled as a right "to a share
of the earnings "of people who produce."

fuel or oil leak and a tire blowout on the chartered,
Vietnam-bound DC 8 that crashed here, killing 4 7 of
the 229 persons aboard.
The investigators-one member of the National
Transportation Safety Board and eight board specialists
in aircraft accidents said the reports were unconfirmed.

Members of the team said they expected to be in
Anchorage a week or longer. No public hearings were
planned and most of the material gathered will be
returned to Washington, D.C., for evaluation.
"We will determine the probable cause," said Isabel
Burgess, a member of the board. "It may be hard, but
we will do it."
Traffic Toll
The traffic death toll across the nation for the
Thanksgiving holiday climbed to 58 6 Sunday.
Inclement weather caused iced and slippery roads in
many sections and contributed to the rising fatality
rate.
The count of deaths began at 6 p.m., local time,
Wednesday and ends at midnight Sunday.
No Income
LOS ANGELES — Gov. Reagan, saying citizens don't
have a "right" to share in this nation's wealth, has
affirmed his opposition to a national guaranteed annual
wage program for welfare recipients. "I believe the

government of the United States is supposed to
promote the general welfare," Reagan said. "I don't
believe it is supposed to provide it."
The governor made his comments in the Public
Broadcasting Service show, "The Advocates," which
will be telecast by KCET, Los Angeles, and other PBS
stations Tuesday.
Joining Reagan in opposing a $2,4 00 annual wage
for welfare family of four were Roger Freeman, a
researcher at the Hoover Institution at Stanford, and
William Rusher, publisher of the National Review.
Speaking in favor of a guaranteed income plan were
Howard Miller, a USC law professor, Texas state Sen.
Barbara Jordan and Theodore Marmor, associate
director of the University of Minnesota School of
Public Affairs.
Reagan said he thought any minimum income
program would increase rather than reduce welfare
bureaucracy and that welfare costs would escalate
sharply.
"I have to say no," the governor added, "if you ask
me if anyone is morally entitled as a right "to a share
of the earnings "of people who produce."
New Attack
SAIGON — An American bomber attacked a
radar-controlled anti-aircraft position inside North
Vietnam on Monday, the U.S. Command announced.
The command said in a communique the gun site
was located 5 1 /2 miles north of the Laotian border.
It termed the raid "protective reaction," which it
called "the inherent right of self-defense."
Sources said the anti-aircraft gun did not fire on the
American fighter-bomber, an Air Force FlO5
Thunderchief, but threatened the supersonic jet and
other U.S. aircraft by zeroing in with radar in
preparation for firing.
