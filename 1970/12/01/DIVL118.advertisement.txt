Today In The 'Daily'
Two years ago today, Kenneth S. Pitzer became the sixth
President of Stanford University. In his letter of resignation
from Rice University, Pitzer blithely penned, "My decision to
accept the Stanford position was based primarily on the
attractiveness and challenge which it presents." Hearing that,
one cynic later commented, "You should only live so long."
After 18 months at Stanford, Pitzer decided, apropos the
keynote speaker at his inauguration, that life here was indeed
unliveable. "After a certain length of time," he regretfully
noted in his final press conference, "you suffer some wounds
and get a bit tired."
If you're the bearer of any happy or sad news about
presidents arriving or departing, call our news office at
321-2300 x 4362. If you're advertising vacant administrative
positions, call the business office at 327-4150.
