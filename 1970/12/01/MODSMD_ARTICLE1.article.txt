# Lyman Foregoes Inauguration As Part Of Budget Cutting Plan
## 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman
Monday announced plans to "take his
inaugural to the people" as one of the
cutbacks in the University's Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP).
Lyman said that instead of the
traditional ceremonies, he and Mrs.
Lyman will visit alumni in six cities
across the country during the coming
months. He said the elimination of the
inauguration would save the University
$30,000.
Smiling slightly under the glare of
television floodlights, Lyman explained
that the change was crucial to promote
understanding among the school's
alumni of what BAP means to the
University.
"If we want people to have faith in
us," he said, "We believe we have to
maintain the basis for that faith in an
openly observable and credible
performance."
New BAP Objective
The president's comments came at
an early-morning news conference
called to discuss the new $6 million
BAP objective over five years. The
previous objective of the program was a
reduction of $2.5 million from the
Operating Budget over a four-year
period.
Through BAP, the University hopes
to achieve a balanced Operating Budget
with an annual growth rate of
approximately 6.5 per cent at the start
of the 1975-76 budget period. The
present Operating Budget totals $57
million annually; it will total nearly
$75 million at the start of the 1975
school year.

The BAP committee, which is
composed of five faculty members and
two students, has not yet
recommended where the budget cuts
should be made in the upcoming
1971-72 budget. The BAP objective for
that budget is a reduction of slightly
more than $1 .26 million in the
Operating Budget.
Cost Cutting Efforts
Last year, when a savings of nearly
$1.9 million was accomplished, half of
the savings came from a new method of
utilizing prepaid land-lease income. The
remainder of the savings came from
cuts in instruction; libraries, student
services and non-academic areas.
Lyman said that the quality of
education would not be effected by the
long-range belt tightening:
"We are determined to preserve the
quality of our academic programs at
the present level or better. I think that
we're making substantial improvements
at the same time we're making these
cuts."
Financial Problems Not New
He said that the financial problems
now facing the University are not
"unique" and he believes that the
school, through its 10-year financial
projections, has responded with more
"rational judgement" and rapidity than
"a good many institutions."
"We have been and are determined
not to get in the kind of downward
spiral or ever-increasing
deficits. .. which, once you're into it,
is very, very hard to climb out of," he
said.
Lyman attributed many of the

University's financial difficulties to
various aspects of inflation, "shifts in
federal funding" and in support of
university research, and a need for
more contributions and gifts to the
school. Other financial problems
include unforseen costs related to
student services, including the
establishment of new offices, increased
security costs, and other programs
resulting from the Study of Education
at Stanford.
Stock Market Effects
Support from living individuals was
down, Lyman said, because of
"difficulties in the stock market and on
campus."
He said it was difficult to assess the
precise effects of campus violence on
donors to the University. "There's no
denying that some people believe the
best way to answer campus unrest is to
cut off support to the universities," he
said.
"It's profoundly ironic, since most
of the revolutionary opponents of The
Establishment would like nothing
better than to see the universities
systematically starved of funds by
people who have been in the habit of
supporting them," he concluded.

LO, THE GATHERING STORM—The thundergod's been around a lot this weekend, and when it reigns, it pours. Even the
photographer was properly impressed.
President Richard W. Lyman
Monday announced plans to "take his
inaugural to the people" as one of the
cutbacks in the University's Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP).
Lyman said that instead of the
traditional ceremonies, he and Mrs.
Lyman will visit alumni in six cities
across the country during the coming
months. He said the elimination of the
inauguration would save the University
$30,000.
Smiling slightly under the glare of
television floodlights, Lyman explained
that the change was crucial to promote
understanding among the school's
alumni of what BAP means to the
University.
"If we want people to have faith in
us," he said, "We believe we have to
maintain the basis for that faith in an
openly observable and credible
performance."
New BAP Objective
The president's comments came at
an early-morning news conference
called to discuss the new $6 million
BAP objective over five years. The
previous objective of the program was a
reduction of $2.5 million from the
Operating Budget over a four-year
period.
Through BAP, the University hopes
to achieve a balanced Operating Budget
with an annual growth rate of
approximately 6.5 per cent at the start
of the 1975-76 budget period. The
present Operating Budget totals $57
million annually; it will total nearly
$75 million at the start of the 1975
school year.

The BAP committee, which is
composed of five faculty members and
two students, has not yet
recommended where the budget cuts
should be made in the upcoming
1971-72 budget. The BAP objective for
that budget is a reduction of slightly
more than $1 .26 million in the
Operating Budget.
Cost Cutting Efforts
Last year, when a savings of nearly
$1.9 million was accomplished, half of
the savings came from a new method of
utilizing prepaid land-lease income. The
remainder of the savings came from
cuts in instruction; libraries, student
services and non-academic areas.
Lyman said that the quality of
education would not be effected by the
long-range belt tightening:
"We are determined to preserve the
quality of our academic programs at
the present level or better. I think that
we're making substantial improvements
at the same time we're making these
cuts."
Financial Problems Not New
He said that the financial problems
now facing the University are not
"unique" and he believes that the
school, through its 10-year financial
projections, has responded with more
"rational judgement" and rapidity than
"a good many institutions."
"We have been and are determined
not to get in the kind of downward
spiral or ever-increasing
deficits. .. which, once you're into it,
is very, very hard to climb out of," he
said.
Lyman attributed many of the

University's financial difficulties to
various aspects of inflation, "shifts in
federal funding" and in support of
university research, and a need for
more contributions and gifts to the
school. Other financial problems
include unforseen costs related to
student services, including the
establishment of new offices, increased
security costs, and other programs
resulting from the Study of Education
at Stanford.
Stock Market Effects
Support from living individuals was
down, Lyman said, because of
"difficulties in the stock market and on
campus."
He said it was difficult to assess the
precise effects of campus violence on
donors to the University. "There's no
denying that some people believe the
best way to answer campus unrest is to
cut off support to the universities," he
said.
"It's profoundly ironic, since most
of the revolutionary opponents of The
Establishment would like nothing
better than to see the universities
systematically starved of funds by
people who have been in the habit of
supporting them," he concluded.
