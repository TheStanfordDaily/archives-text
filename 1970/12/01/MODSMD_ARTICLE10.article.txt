Ky Visits S.F. Today
SAN FRANCISCO — Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky of
South Vietnam is scheduled to address the San Francisco
Commonwealth Club today under unusual security
precautions against antiwar demonstrators.
The exact time and place of Ky's arrival by air from
Washington for the luncheon meeting were closely kept
9ecrets, but the South Vietnamese consulate said he and
his party planned to spend tonight in San Francisco
before flying to Los Angeles. No sightseeing was
programmed.
About 1,000 members of the Commonwealth Club,
which entertains guest speakers at a weekly luncheon,
have tickets for the event in the Fairmont Hotel's grand
ballroom.
An unannounced number of Secret Service men and
agents of other local federal security forces were assigned.
San Francisco police disclosed they planned to have
150 uniformed officers, 40 plainclothesmen and 20
mounted patrolmen on duty for the event.
New Weatherman Threat
SAN FRANCISCO — Police were instructed to be
especially vigilant Monday after a letter signed with the
name of Weatherman leader Bemadine Dohrn threatened
a wave of attacks against police and military installations.
The office of Police Chief Alfred Nelder broadcast the
warning to all cars, telling officers to be especially
watchful against possible attakes on policemen or public
buildings.
The letter was received Monday morning by the San
Francisco Bureau of the Associated Press. It bore a
Saturday postmark from Berkeley.
An FBI spokesman said it could not verify immediately
whether the letter actually was signed by Miss Dohrn, who
is on the FBl's 10 Most Wanted list.
The AP received a photocopy of a hand-lettered note.
The Berkeley Tribe, an antiestablishment underground
weekly newspaper, said it too received a copy.
Miss Dohrn, a self-described Communist, is wanted on
charges of unlawful interstate flight to avoid prosecution
for mob action, violation of federal antiriot laws and
conspiracy.
Census Figures Released
WASHINGTON — The Census Bureau Monday set the
nation's population at 204.7 million in a final official
count which gives California five new House seats and the
title of the most-populous state.

For the first time, the census included 1 5 million
Americans living overseas as servicemen or federal
employes, and their dependents. They were apportioned
among the state to help figure representation in the U.S.
House of Representatives. Americans living overseas as
employes of private companies were not counted.
Calif. Budget Squeeze
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan imposed the first step of
a tough new "squeeze and cut and trim" economy
program Monday in a desperate effort to cover a $150
million deficit without a tax increase.
The Republican governor froze hiring of new state
employees and halted spending for new equipment such as
autos and typewriters - capital construction and
out-of-state travel.
He blamed the red ink on a combination of soaring
welfare costs and a dip in state income caused by the
business slump.
The second step is almost certain to mean a cutback in
welfare programs, but administration officials did not say
when it would come.
This could produce a battle between Reagan and the
Democratic controlled legislature and perhaps even with
the administration of Republican President Nixon.
Reagan, just re-elected, has been a chief critic of
federal welfare programs and of Nixon's minimum aid
welfare reform plan.
Conspiracy' Hits Hoover
WASHINGTON — An anti-war group of Roman Catholic
priests, nuns and laymen denied Monday plotting a kidnap
and other accusations by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,
and accused him of trying to set the stage for more
pressure on leftist groups.
The eleven members of the East Coast Conspiracy to
Save Lives said a law suit for defamation of character or
libel is being considered.
Hoover, testifying before a Senate appropriations
subcommittee last Friday, said the group was plotting to
disrupt capital utility lines and kidnap an unidentified
White House official. Ransom would be an end to
bombing in Indochina and release of "political prisoners,"
he said.
Hoover said the principal leaders of the group were
brothers Daniel and Philip Berrigan, two priests presently
serving sentences in a federal prison at Danbury,
Conn. The Berrigans issued a statement earlier denying
Hoover's assertion and saying he should
"either ... prosecute us or publicly retract the charges he
made."

priests, nuns and laymen denied Monday plotting a kidnap
and other accusations by FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover,
and accused him of trying to set the stage for more
pressure on leftist groups.
The eleven members of the East Coast Conspiracy to
Save Lives said a law suit for defamation of character or
libel is being considered.
Hoover, testifying before a Senate appropriations
subcommittee last Friday, said the group was plotting to
disrupt capital utility lines and kidnap an unidentified
White House official. Ransom would be an end to
bombing in Indochina and release of "political prisoners,"
he said.
Hoover said the principal leaders of the group were
brothers Daniel and Philip Berrigan, two priests presently
serving sentences in a federal prison at Danbury,
Conn. The Berrigans issued a statement earlier denying
Hoover's assertion and saying he should
"either ... prosecute us or publicly retract the charges he
made."
Ky Visits S.F. Today
SAN FRANCISCO — Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky of
South Vietnam is scheduled to address the San Francisco
Commonwealth Club today under unusual security
precautions against antiwar demonstrators.
The exact time and place of Ky's arrival by air from
Washington for the luncheon meeting were closely kept
9ecrets, but the South Vietnamese consulate said he and
his party planned to spend tonight in San Francisco
before flying to Los Angeles. No sightseeing was
programmed.
About 1,000 members of the Commonwealth Club,
which entertains guest speakers at a weekly luncheon,
have tickets for the event in the Fairmont Hotel's grand
ballroom.
An unannounced number of Secret Service men and
agents of other local federal security forces were assigned.
San Francisco police disclosed they planned to have
150 uniformed officers, 40 plainclothesmen and 20
mounted patrolmen on duty for the event.
New Weatherman Threat
SAN FRANCISCO — Police were instructed to be
especially vigilant Monday after a letter signed with the
name of Weatherman leader Bemadine Dohrn threatened
a wave of attacks against police and military installations.
The office of Police Chief Alfred Nelder broadcast the
warning to all cars, telling officers to be especially
watchful against possible attakes on policemen or public
buildings.
The letter was received Monday morning by the San
Francisco Bureau of the Associated Press. It bore a
Saturday postmark from Berkeley.
An FBI spokesman said it could not verify immediately
whether the letter actually was signed by Miss Dohrn, who
is on the FBl's 10 Most Wanted list.
The AP received a photocopy of a hand-lettered note.
The Berkeley Tribe, an antiestablishment underground
weekly newspaper, said it too received a copy.
Miss Dohrn, a self-described Communist, is wanted on
charges of unlawful interstate flight to avoid prosecution
for mob action, violation of federal antiriot laws and
conspiracy.
Census Figures Released
WASHINGTON — The Census Bureau Monday set the
nation's population at 204.7 million in a final official
count which gives California five new House seats and the
title of the most-populous state.

For the first time, the census included 1 5 million
Americans living overseas as servicemen or federal
employes, and their dependents. They were apportioned
among the state to help figure representation in the U.S.
House of Representatives. Americans living overseas as
employes of private companies were not counted.
Calif. Budget Squeeze
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan imposed the first step of
a tough new "squeeze and cut and trim" economy
program Monday in a desperate effort to cover a $150
million deficit without a tax increase.
The Republican governor froze hiring of new state
employees and halted spending for new equipment such as
autos and typewriters - capital construction and
out-of-state travel.
He blamed the red ink on a combination of soaring
welfare costs and a dip in state income caused by the
business slump.
The second step is almost certain to mean a cutback in
welfare programs, but administration officials did not say
when it would come.
This could produce a battle between Reagan and the
Democratic controlled legislature and perhaps even with
the administration of Republican President Nixon.
Reagan, just re-elected, has been a chief critic of
federal welfare programs and of Nixon's minimum aid
welfare reform plan.
