# Nixon 'Cloaks Power'

John Chancellor, NBC National
Affairs Correspondent, stated in a
speech delivered here last night that "It
is difficult, if not impossible, for
anyone to know what is in Richard
Nixon's mind".
With what Chancellor termed
"calculated unpredictability", Nixon is
following the example of the late
General de Gaulle by "cloaking his
power in mystery". The President, says
Chancellor, "wants the United States to
be powerful, unpredictable, armed, and
dangerous."
According to Chancellor, Nixon's
1968 campaign promises carried
him smoothly through his first year in
office. Hopes of improved relations
with the Russians, the Vietnamization
program, and promises to control crime
and halt inflation satisfied public
opinion until the October Moratorium.
The President then made the
statement, "I will not be moved", fired
draft director General Hershey, and
spoke to student demonstrators about

sports. Chancellor said that the press in
Washington reported these events as
"disorganized" and "stumbling". The
President, he recalled, "then unchained
Agnew to attack the press."
After the effects of the Moratorium
had subsided, there followed what
Chancellor termed a "serene time".
Then came the President's second
political blunder—his handling of the
Cambodia crisis. "Although it may have
been militarily sound", Chancellor
stated, "Nixon's over-done, over-drawn
explanation of the invasion only served
to incite emotion".
Chancellor, who addressed an
overflow audience in the art auditorium
described Nixon's philosophy of power
as one of the President alone in his
study making decisions without
consulting his advisors. "Nixon sees
power as flowing from the top", and
not as a series of inputs combining to
produce an output. He likens himself to
General Patton, "a loser who came
back, a tough guy", and "an instrument
of American power", relying on
strength and unpredictability.

HO, CHE, MAO, DICK, AND SPIRO—That was the topic NBC news
commentator John Chancellor was supposed to talk about last night. Although he
didn't speak much about Ho, Che, Mao, and Spiro, he did analyze Nixon before
an overflow crowd in the art auditorium.
