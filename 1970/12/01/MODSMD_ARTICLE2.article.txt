# Speakers Protest War Escalation
## White, Radicals Scuffle Outside Rally 
### DAVE SPECTOR JON DEDMON 
Several members of the Radical Caucus took part in
a short scuffle with Ray White, chairman of the
conservative Free Campus Movement, (FCM), as White
left a jeering crowd of radicals at an i»ti-war meeting
last night.
White, who has actively sought to have radical
Diarmuid McGuire's probation revoked, was singled
out in the audience by several of McGuire's supporters
at a Memorial Church gathering called to discuss
opposition to the Vietnam war.
The FCM chairman left the meeting after speakers
angrily denounced him and was followed by nearly 30
radicals as he walked rapidly towards the Physics Tank.
The group tried to trip him up. White then broke into a
run, but the group caught up with him near the
Biology building.
After a member of the crowd yelled, "They've got
him," White and several members of the crowd were
seen swinging fists. White later estimated the number
who hit him at "no more than six."
Slight Bruises
White reported that his glasses were broken and said
that he received slight bruises. His mother and another

student with White both left the meeting but were not
bothered by the group.
Earlier in the evening, White had difficulty entering
the church. A crowd blocked his way at first but later
thinned out and allowed him in.
During a question period following a panel
presentation, Tim Gadus of the White Panthers
criticized the speakers for their "metaphysical"
explanations of the Vietnam war. "Someone is here
tonight who thinks we should drop 500 pound bombs
on the Vietnamese, drop napalm on people .. . Ray
White," Gadus said.
Sunday School
A crowd of 7 0 radicals in the rear of the church
chanted "speak, pig, speak" until FCM member Frank
Moore yelled "Hue made My Lai look like a Sunday
school picnic. The hands of both sides are equally
bloody."
RU member Janet Weiss then declared, "There are
two sides to the war, the ruling class and the other, the
oppressed side. The only way to stop the war is to fight
by any means necessary. There are pigs like White who
want to take away our freedom."
Soon after her speech, White left and the radical
group followed.

In a statement last night White said he did not know
any of the people who attacked him but claimed that
he could identify them if he saw them again. He added,
"The University was lax at protecting my safety."
White testified last summer against McGuire who
was eventually convicted of malicious mischief
stemming from disturbances here last spring during
Off-ROTC protests. On Oct. 2, McGuire wrote a
column for the Daily from jail where he was serving
part of his sentence and accused White of being a
"snitch." After claiming that snitches hindered the
radical movement, McGuire added, "Take care of
snitches."
During the meeting speakers outlined several ways
to oppose the war. Robert McAfee Brown, professer of
religion, and Dave Josephson, a member of the
non-violent Columbae House stressed "revolutionary
non-violence" Brown called for non-compliance with
the draft and said, "work through the political
process."
BSU speaker Willie Newberry said the "bombings of
Vietnam and Guinea show the necessity of fighting on
many fronts." He added, "As a black my position is
already decided. For white folks — an alliance with the
Third World people, then you're talking about our
struggle."

Off-ROTC protests. On Oct. 2, McGuire wrote a
column for the Daily from jail where he was serving
part of his sentence and accused White of being a
"snitch." After claiming that snitches hindered the
radical movement, McGuire added, "Take care of
snitches."
During the meeting speakers outlined several ways
to oppose the war. Robert McAfee Brown, professer of
religion, and Dave Josephson, a member of the
non-violent Columbae House stressed "revolutionary
non-violence" Brown called for non-compliance with
the draft and said, "work through the political
process."
BSU speaker Willie Newberry said the "bombings of
Vietnam and Guinea show the necessity of fighting on
many fronts." He added, "As a black my position is
already decided. For white folks — an alliance with the
Third World people, then you're talking about our
struggle."
Several members of the Radical Caucus took part in
a short scuffle with Ray White, chairman of the
conservative Free Campus Movement, (FCM), as White
left a jeering crowd of radicals at an i»ti-war meeting
last night.
White, who has actively sought to have radical
Diarmuid McGuire's probation revoked, was singled
out in the audience by several of McGuire's supporters
at a Memorial Church gathering called to discuss
opposition to the Vietnam war.
The FCM chairman left the meeting after speakers
angrily denounced him and was followed by nearly 30
radicals as he walked rapidly towards the Physics Tank.
The group tried to trip him up. White then broke into a
run, but the group caught up with him near the
Biology building.
After a member of the crowd yelled, "They've got
him," White and several members of the crowd were
seen swinging fists. White later estimated the number
who hit him at "no more than six."
Slight Bruises
White reported that his glasses were broken and said
that he received slight bruises. His mother and another

student with White both left the meeting but were not
bothered by the group.
Earlier in the evening, White had difficulty entering
the church. A crowd blocked his way at first but later
thinned out and allowed him in.
During a question period following a panel
presentation, Tim Gadus of the White Panthers
criticized the speakers for their "metaphysical"
explanations of the Vietnam war. "Someone is here
tonight who thinks we should drop 500 pound bombs
on the Vietnamese, drop napalm on people .. . Ray
White," Gadus said.
Sunday School
A crowd of 7 0 radicals in the rear of the church
chanted "speak, pig, speak" until FCM member Frank
Moore yelled "Hue made My Lai look like a Sunday
school picnic. The hands of both sides are equally
bloody."
RU member Janet Weiss then declared, "There are
two sides to the war, the ruling class and the other, the
oppressed side. The only way to stop the war is to fight
by any means necessary. There are pigs like White who
want to take away our freedom."
Soon after her speech, White left and the radical
group followed.

In a statement last night White said he did not know
any of the people who attacked him but claimed that
he could identify them if he saw them again. He added,
"The University was lax at protecting my safety."
White testified last summer against McGuire who
was eventually convicted of malicious mischief
stemming from disturbances here last spring during
Off-ROTC protests. On Oct. 2, McGuire wrote a
column for the Daily from jail where he was serving
part of his sentence and accused White of being a
