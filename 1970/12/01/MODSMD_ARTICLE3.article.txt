# Campus Grass Dealing, Usage At All-Time High
## 'Dope' Usage Triples 
### JIM ALMAS 
The number of students having some
experience with marijuana has more
than tripled during the past three years,
according to a report published by the
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
Figures compiled by the Institute
show that 21 per cent of students here
had smoked marijuana at least once
during the academic year 1966-67. The
number jumped to 57 per cent in 1969
and to 70 per cent during the past year.
According to the study, "the figure
of 57 per cent for the class of 1969 is
striking, but it may not at all be out of
line to expect a figure of 8 0-90 per cent
for the class of 1971
The report concludes that "the use
of marijuana by students at this
university is becoming an accepted

mode of social expression and this
acceptance is not confined to members
of the drug-using subculture itself."
As suggested, the use of marijuana
does not appear to be restricted to
specific types of individuals or living
groups.
One coed living group reportedly
held a wild Halloween party highlighted
by the breaking of a pinata filled with
nearly 120 joints. A co-ed reported
attending a party with business school
students at which party-goers smoked
pot for a specified time, regulated by
an alarm clock. When the clock went
off, the joints went out.
Other groups have passed out the
drug as a party favor. Still others,
according to one undergraduate, put
"tricks in the treats" on Halloween

Usage at overseas campuses may be
as extensive as that here. According to
Emily Garfield, member of the Blum
study, "there appears to be a large
number of students coming back from
Europe with a 'taste' for hashish."
However, the results of the overseas
campus study are not yet complete. It
appears, nonetheless, that the final
report will not differ much from
current estimates. One member of a
recent France group estimated that 75
per cent of his group smoked once a
week or more and that only 4 or 5 per
cent had never smoked.
Less specific evidence of common
marijuana usage is available from the
professional schools. However, one law
student estimated usage among his
classmates at about 8 0 per cent with
perhaps 20-30 per cent using it
regularly.
The New York Times recently
reported that as many as 68-70 per cent
of medical school students surveyed at
two medical schools have smoked
marijuana at least once. I)r. Jared
Tinklenberg at the Medical School here
claims that the story is erroneous, but
concern over reportedly high incidence
rates here has resulted in the
appointment of four University
psychiatrists to a committee formed to
study marijuana usage by medical
students. Dr. Tinklenberg, one of the
four appointed, says the committee will
release its findings by February 1971.
Students, says the study, are not the
only sector of the University
community participating in the
unlawful act. This summer an assistant
professor here was charged in Superior
Court, for growing marijuana plants in
his backyard. Police counted 242
plants, one nine feet tall

grouping of their business activity.
Dealers of radical, moderate, and even
conservative political persuasions all sell
grass.
Selling dope here is done as a
profit-making or a pleasure-making
venture. Usually it is both. As one
dealer said, "As long as I can get people
dope and make a little money on the
side, well, that's 0.K., right."

claims that the story is erroneous, but
concern over reportedly high incidence
rates here has resulted in the
appointment of four University
psychiatrists to a committee formed to
study marijuana usage by medical
students. Dr. Tinklenberg, one of the
four appointed, says the committee will
release its findings by February 1971.
Students, says the study, are not the
only sector of the University
community participating in the
unlawful act. This summer an assistant
professor here was charged in Superior
Court, for growing marijuana plants in
his backyard. Police counted 242
plants, one nine feet tall

between campus dealers beyond the
grouping of their business activity.
Dealers of radical, moderate, and even
conservative political persuasions all sell
grass.
Selling dope here is done as a
profit-making or a pleasure-making
venture. Usually it is both. As one
dealer said, "As long as I can get people
dope and make a little money on the
side, well, that's 0.K., right."
The number of students having some
experience with marijuana has more
than tripled during the past three years,
according to a report published by the
Institute for the Study of Human
Problems.
Figures compiled by the Institute
show that 21 per cent of students here
had smoked marijuana at least once
during the academic year 1966-67. The
number jumped to 57 per cent in 1969
and to 70 per cent during the past year.
According to the study, "the figure
of 57 per cent for the class of 1969 is
striking, but it may not at all be out of
line to expect a figure of 8 0-90 per cent
for the class of 1971
The report concludes that "the use
of marijuana by students at this
university is becoming an accepted

mode of social expression and this
acceptance is not confined to members
of the drug-using subculture itself."
As suggested, the use of marijuana
does not appear to be restricted to
specific types of individuals or living
groups.
One coed living group reportedly
held a wild Halloween party highlighted
by the breaking of a pinata filled with
nearly 120 joints. A co-ed reported
attending a party with business school
students at which party-goers smoked
pot for a specified time, regulated by
an alarm clock. When the clock went
off, the joints went out.
Other groups have passed out the
drug as a party favor. Still others,
according to one undergraduate, put
"tricks in the treats" on Halloween

Usage at overseas campuses may be
as extensive as that here. According to
Emily Garfield, member of the Blum
study, "there appears to be a large
number of students coming back from
Europe with a 'taste' for hashish."
However, the results of the overseas
campus study are not yet complete. It
appears, nonetheless, that the final
report will not differ much from
current estimates. One member of a
recent France group estimated that 75
per cent of his group smoked once a
week or more and that only 4 or 5 per
cent had never smoked.
Less specific evidence of common
marijuana usage is available from the
professional schools. However, one law
student estimated usage among his
classmates at about 8 0 per cent with
perhaps 20-30 per cent using it
regularly.
The New York Times recently
reported that as many as 68-70 per cent
of medical school students surveyed at
two medical schools have smoked
marijuana at least once. I)r. Jared
