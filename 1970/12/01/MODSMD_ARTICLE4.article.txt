# Pot — Fun And Profit
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
For students plagued by rising
tuition costs and expensive patterns of
escape, 'scoring' a key of marijuana on
campus has become a sure way of
making an extra buck, with the added
incentive of enjoyable working
conditions. Hence, in every residence
on campus there is at least one student
dealing marijuana for fun and profit.
Increased marijuana usage by the
student body has created a gold mine
for dealers. An investment of about
$200 for a kilogram of grass will hield
almost twice that much when sold.
Increased usage appears to have
legitimized the avocation of dealing.
Campus police have found it impossible
to weed-out the campus and there are
few objections from students to the use
of marijuana in campus dorms and
fraternities. Grass is accepted by
students and sought by them as is the
dealer who can provide it.
The majority of University dealers
are small time. They buy from a half to
three kilos at a time and sell it over a
period of weeks or even months. These
dealers rarely go off-campus to buy,
but instead purchase from the handful
of larger dealers on campus.
A Few Kilos
One large dealer traces his business
from 1 967 when "I sold three keys a
week around campus; now I'm selling
fifteen." Another dealer, a junior who
has sold about 125 kilos since his
freshman year says that marijuana
usage "is increasing slightly."
The large dealers here have contacts
in Palo Alto and Kan Francisco. Most of
them believe these off-campus contacts
get grass from the Mafia in Mexico.

Along with monetary gain,
widespread desire to keep friends (and
oneself) cheaply supplied is an
equally important reason for buying.
Dealers and Customers seem to have an
unwritten agreement to help keep each
other supplied.
A Little Friendly Help
The most common method used to
get friends high with a little help from
their dealer is to sell enough of a kilo to
either break even or make a small
profit, but still have a few ounces of
grass left that can be spread around as
"people's dope." One dealer described
the bond between himself and his
customers. "I sell grass to people who
need it. I sell enough to break even and
then I keep the rest of the stuff that
I've bought and get me and my friends
high. I get a nice little bag of clean
weed, and 1 get it for free. You can't
beat it."
Another aspect of the University
marijuana community is a strict
security check on customers. Only
friends, and friends of friends are
considered eligible customers by
campus dealers. As one dealer said, "If
somebody came in and said 'Hey, I hear
you've got some narcotics and I'd like
to buy some', I wouldn't sell to him. I
don't sell unless there is something
familiar about the guy."
Another dealer outlined his business
policy similarly—"l don't go looking
for people to buy, "he said, "I sell only
to people who know me."
No Police Problem
Police are not the main concern of
dealers because the enforcement of

possession of marijuana laws on campus
is impossible when an estimated
three-fourths of the student body is
guilty of the offense. Unless police
believe someone is dealing in massive
quantities of marijuana or dealing in
hard drugs such as heroin, there is no
response.
The risks of dealing in dope, while
not coming from the police, do exist.
The biggest worry among small dealers
is theft. The combination of an
unlocked door and a poorly hidden kilo
leads to unreportable rip-offs in dorms
and other residences.
A more serious type of theft has
recently become a hazard. Threats with
guns and knives have relieved local
dealers of their investment at least
twice in the past three months.
Poor Quality
Another risk involves getting burned
by a poor quality batch of marijuana.
One junior recalled the key of
"Nebraska Green" that he bought. "My
brother still owes me for that. It was so
bad that you could smoke a whole lid
and not even feel it. I sold a bag or two
and then decided not to try anymore."
Few dealers will acknowledge their
actions as being a form of rebellion
against the Establishment. "It's just a
basic law of supply and demand," one
student declared, "I might as well be
getting a slice of the pot pie as
anybody." Another dealer looked at
the pie angle similarly. He sold
marijuana originally to get enough
money to buy a BSA 250. but now he
is selling his bike to get capital so that
he can buy more grass to sell. Then he's
going to buy a bigger cycle. "It's
vicious," he quipped.
There are few generalized similarities
that he had three experiences with
marijuana and had sampled "magic
mushrooms" he had obtained from a
Mexican Indian tribe. He was testifying
in defense of a person charged with a
possession violation, claiming that the
defendent used grass to gain religious
insight.
Alumni reaction to changing
attitudes of the University community
appears to be moderate. Bob Beyers of
the University News Service reports
that he has * received no negative
reactions to a pro-legalization article
written by Law Professor John Kaplan
published in a recent edition of the
Stanford Observer.
Grass In The Stadium
Some observant members of the
University community contend that
liquor is not the only relaxer now being
enjoyed at pre-football game alumni
picnics. A coed reports that during the
SC football game she watched several
undergraduates passing joints among
the fans. When one joint was passed to
a middle-age couple, they simply
looked at it curiously and gave it to the
student next to them.
The general consensus seems to be
that pot at Stanford is not an issue of
particular interest. Those who indulge
do so in an atmosphere of peace and
contentment, free from the thought of
being busted, while those who don't
have no apparent urge to interfere.
