# implications of research
## Responsible Science 
### 
kimball, blanchard, and lorell

As engineering graduate
students and residents of the
McCullough and Aero/Astro
Buildings, we have been
concerned with the presence of
war-related research on campus.
Concern for the implications of
our work as engineers has led us
to think seriously about where we
are going to make our professional
contributions.
In our cases, the feeling of
responsibility for our engineering
work devolves from seeing the
mess irresponsible science can
make of the world. Almost as
important are the discussions we
have had amongst ourselves and
with other concerned members of
the Stanford Community.
Many of us, in rational
moments, identify at least in part
with the fundamental
humanitarian concerns of the
radical students. Most if not all of
us are willing to discuss the
relevance of our work to the
Stanford community with anyone
who is interested (it is interesting
to note that attendance at the
open houses in our laboratories
has been dismal indeed). In fact.

such discussions have changed
some people's outlook on the
relevance of their work.
But to be confronted in the
middle of the night by a hostile
mob of disshevelled longhairs and
teenyboppers who have absolutely
no interest in communication is
not merely frustrating - it is
maddening out of all proportion.
Some of us approached these
people just prior to the rock
throwing Monday night, and were
brushed aside in the name of the
revolution with admonitions such
as "You protest in your way, I'll
protest in mine", "These kids (the
teenyboppers) are oppressed by
the establishment", and "This is
the only way to fight war
research".
The only conclusion we can
draw from this attitude is that this
group is not interested in us
scientists after all, but merely in
its own self-aggrandisement. The
leaders of the group apparently
think that rock throwing will
focus everyone's attention on
some abstract off-campus issue.
Our advice to the leaders of
this group is:

First: If you are so concerned
about the monolithic menace of
science, then come and talk to
US. We have more people who are
willing to carry on serious
discussions on war related
research than you have in your
whole brigade.
Second: If you are breaking
our windows because you want
publicity then you deserve to be
arrested-promptly.
Third: If you are throwing
rocks at us to protest something
off campus-then you are chicken.
Go off campus with your protest
and learn what a rare privilege it is
to have an open campus where
virtually any view is tolerated. A
few more upheavals like the other
night and the Reagan version of
'free speech' will extend all the
way to inner quad.
And finally, our advice to the
parents of the teenyboppers is -
we agree, oppression is definitely
the problem. What they need is
more of it-from you.

group is not interested in us
scientists after all, but merely in
its own self-aggrandisement. The
leaders of the group apparently
think that rock throwing will
focus everyone's attention on
some abstract off-campus issue.
Our advice to the leaders of
this group is:

First: If you are so concerned
about the monolithic menace of
science, then come and talk to
US. We have more people who are
willing to carry on serious
discussions on war related
research than you have in your
whole brigade.
Second: If you are breaking
our windows because you want
publicity then you deserve to be
arrested-promptly.
Third: If you are throwing
rocks at us to protest something
off campus-then you are chicken.
Go off campus with your protest
and learn what a rare privilege it is
to have an open campus where
virtually any view is tolerated. A
few more upheavals like the other
night and the Reagan version of
'free speech' will extend all the
way to inner quad.
And finally, our advice to the
parents of the teenyboppers is -
we agree, oppression is definitely
the problem. What they need is
more of it-from you.

As engineering graduate
students and residents of the
McCullough and Aero/Astro
Buildings, we have been
concerned with the presence of
war-related research on campus.
Concern for the implications of
our work as engineers has led us
to think seriously about where we
are going to make our professional
contributions.
In our cases, the feeling of
responsibility for our engineering
work devolves from seeing the
mess irresponsible science can
make of the world. Almost as
important are the discussions we
have had amongst ourselves and
with other concerned members of
the Stanford Community.
Many of us, in rational
moments, identify at least in part
with the fundamental
humanitarian concerns of the
radical students. Most if not all of
us are willing to discuss the
relevance of our work to the
Stanford community with anyone
who is interested (it is interesting
to note that attendance at the
open houses in our laboratories
has been dismal indeed). In fact.

such discussions have changed
some people's outlook on the
relevance of their work.
But to be confronted in the
middle of the night by a hostile
mob of disshevelled longhairs and
teenyboppers who have absolutely
no interest in communication is
not merely frustrating - it is
maddening out of all proportion.
Some of us approached these
people just prior to the rock
throwing Monday night, and were
brushed aside in the name of the
revolution with admonitions such
as "You protest in your way, I'll
protest in mine", "These kids (the
teenyboppers) are oppressed by
the establishment", and "This is
the only way to fight war
research".
The only conclusion we can
draw from this attitude is that this
group is not interested in us
scientists after all, but merely in
its own self-aggrandisement. The
leaders of the group apparently
