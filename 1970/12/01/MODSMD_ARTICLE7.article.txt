Editor, THE DAILY:
The Stanford Radical Caucus,
seeing the attempt to revoke the
probation of D. McGuire as but
another instance of the repression
that the Amerikan government
brings down on revolutionaries,
and realizing that the real source
of this repression, the corporate
elite, controls the university as
well as the government, demands
that:
1.) President Lyman appear at
D. McGuire's probation hearing
and ask that his probation not be
revoked.
2.) The Daily publish a
statement in favor of D. and write
a letter to his probation officer

asking that D.'s probation not be
revoked.
3.) Free D. McGuire.
All power to the people!

senseless acts
Editor, THE DAILY:
The senseless destruction in
North Vietnam and at Stanford is
appalling and deserves to be
condemned. On the one side
President Nixon and his
government and on the other side
the Revolutionary Union and its
followers are trying to bring their
respective enemies "to the
conference table" through a war
of attrition. One hears from both
parties that when the price is too
high the enemy will cave in. Yet,
we do not see anyone cave in.
What we do see is "reaction."
One wonders about the
wisdom, intelligence and integrity
of the parties who advocate these
policies of attrition. Even though
the Editor of the Daily doubted
that Stanford radicals could
advocate such acts as trashing, on
"radical tours" around the
campus during the last few
months, the leaders of the
Revolutionary Union, Stanford
students and ex-students, have
pointed out targets and locations
of appropriate rockpiles. These
leaders, therefore, bear the direct
responsibility for the acts of their
followers.
Only an aroused body of
students, staff, and faculty can
stop the senseless destruction of
the university. Only an aroused
citizenry can stop the senseless
destruction in North Vietnam.
