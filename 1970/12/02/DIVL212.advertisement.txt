IF you want something more than just a
stereo console, and something less than
a houseful of electronic equipment, see
the KLH* Model Twenty-Four.
The Model Twenty-Four is a complete
stereo music system that plays records, FM
broadcasts, AM too if you wish, plus any
thing (such as a tape recorder) you care to
plug into it. Instead of looking like a
Victorian hope chest or an electrician's
nightmare, it comes in three compact and
unobtrusive walnut cabinets that slip
gracefully into a living room. It won't take
up much of your valuable living space, and
it doesn't take a pilot's license to operate.
But what sets it even further apart from
other stereo equipment is the level of per
formance it delivers. It sounds—believe us
—like twice the price. That's why it's the
best-selling, most-talked-about stereo sys
tem on the market.
Ask anyone who owns KLH stereo equip
ment about its performance and value.
Then seek out the Model Twenty-Four
and judge it critically for yourself.
You won't have trouble finding one in a
store. Just follow that well-beaten path.
