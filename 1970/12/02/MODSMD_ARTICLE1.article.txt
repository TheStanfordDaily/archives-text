# Police Hold Back 5000 Protesters At Ky Speech In San Francisco
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
SAN FRANCISCO—Over 5,000
chanting demonstrators clogged the
streets around San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel yesterday afternoon in
a massive but relatively peaceful
demonstration, as Nguyen Cao Ky,vice
president of South Vietnam, addressed
the Commonwealth Club inside.
Towards the end of the four hour
rally, small bands of demonstrators
provided the only major violence as
they hurled rocks and pieces of
pavement at pursuing police and broke
some windows as they were chased up
California Street.
It was reported that San Francisco
Police Chief Alfred Nelder had called
out 420 men, all but 48 in uniform, to
patrol the demonstration, termed by a
Longshoreman's Union observer as
"potentially a riot or a rally." Mounted
police and helmeted police crime
prevention squad (Tactical Squad)
officers lined Mason Street and the
sidewalk in front of the Fairmont. A
police helicopter circled overhead.
Police Restraint
From most observations, police were
apparently trying to be as restrained as
possible, and did not want to provoke a
major street battle.
A San Francisco Police Department
spokesman said last night that 3 4
youths, aged 15 to 26, were arrested on
charges ranging from assault to failure
to disperse. Roving medical teams also
were reported to have treated 23
demonstrators for injuries suffered in
the latter part of the demonstration.
Serious Headwounds
Two policemen received fairly
serious headwounds. One was struck on

the back of the head with a hammer,
while the other was clubbed repeatedly
on the head with a chunk of pavement
after his helmet had been ripped off.
Most of the large crowd in front of
the hotel did not participate in the later
violence. Patrolmen on horseback and
Tac Squad police, under a shower of
rocks, eventually chased demonstrators
from a small park, apparently roughing
up several medics in the process. The
demonstrators were then pursued down
the steep side of Nob Hill.
Many of the mounted police
brandished nightsticks in routing
demonstrators from the park, causing
one observer to maintain, "It had all
the elements of a Cossack charge."
Selling Lies
Ky was speaking to about 1,000
members and guests of the
Commonwealth Club when a youth
draped a Viet Cong flag over a balcony
rail of the Grand Ballroom and
shouted, "This man is selling you lies!"
There were immediate cries from the
audience to "Get him out!" and a
plainclothes Secret Service agent
quickly apprehended the intruder.
One guest of the Commonwealth
Club, a young lawyer, later said that
security inside was "awesome." "I was

absolutely afraid of voicing any vocal
opposition to Ky," he declared. "I'm
sure I would have been hustled right
out."
Going Home
Ky, who was en route home
following a series of conferences in
Washington, D.C., flew to San
Francisco at 2:50 a.m. and went
directly to the Fairmont, thus missing
all the morning's demonstrations.
At about 11:30 police began the
first of several sweeps up California
Street to clear the way for traffic. One
policeman was reported to have ripped
a Viet Cong flag from a woman
demonstrator, with a small crowd
immediately gathering. A group of
police then charged the gathering, and
one Stanford student was struck with a
nightstick, causing a bloody
headwound.
Human Wall
Shortly afterwards hundreds of
marchers broke away from the Mason
and California intersection and formed
a wall across California Street between
the Mark Hopkins Hotel and the
Fairmont's 'Tonga' room.
Methodically, about 5 0 police
slowly pushed the demonstrators up

California into the intersection where
the entire erowd was then forced to the
sidewalks by police using horses as huge
blocking devices. Observers termed this
sweep the most potentially explosive
incident of the rally because tensions
were mounting between police and
demonstrators.
"There's no telling what might have
happened if the kids or the police lost
their heads," one policeman later
commented. "That could have been the
start of a Godawful street battle."
Tactically Horrendous
"The situation was tactically
horrendous," analyzed one
demonstrator. "The people simply were
in a very tense situation with very few
avenues for escape. It wasn't a good
place for a battle."
Dozens of elderly and middle-aged
people staying in the Mark Hopkins
Hotel were witness to the slow sweep
up California from a balcony
immediately above. Many took pictures
of the confrontation with home movie
equipment and 'Instamatic' cameras.
Many seemed almost disturbingly
unaware of the potential for violence
and strolled calmly to the police lines
to gawk at the demonstrators.

on the head with a chunk of pavement
after his helmet had been ripped off.
Most of the large crowd in front of
the hotel did not participate in the later
violence. Patrolmen on horseback and
Tac Squad police, under a shower of
rocks, eventually chased demonstrators
from a small park, apparently roughing
up several medics in the process. The
demonstrators were then pursued down
the steep side of Nob Hill.
Many of the mounted police
brandished nightsticks in routing
demonstrators from the park, causing
one observer to maintain, "It had all
the elements of a Cossack charge."
Selling Lies
Ky was speaking to about 1,000
members and guests of the
Commonwealth Club when a youth
draped a Viet Cong flag over a balcony
rail of the Grand Ballroom and
shouted, "This man is selling you lies!"
There were immediate cries from the
audience to "Get him out!" and a
plainclothes Secret Service agent
quickly apprehended the intruder.
One guest of the Commonwealth
Club, a young lawyer, later said that
security inside was "awesome." "I was

absolutely afraid of voicing any vocal
opposition to Ky," he declared. "I'm
sure I would have been hustled right
out."
Going Home
Ky, who was en route home
following a series of conferences in
Washington, D.C., flew to San
Francisco at 2:50 a.m. and went
directly to the Fairmont, thus missing
all the morning's demonstrations.
At about 11:30 police began the
first of several sweeps up California
Street to clear the way for traffic. One
policeman was reported to have ripped
a Viet Cong flag from a woman
demonstrator, with a small crowd
immediately gathering. A group of
police then charged the gathering, and
one Stanford student was struck with a
nightstick, causing a bloody
headwound.
Human Wall
Shortly afterwards hundreds of
marchers broke away from the Mason
and California intersection and formed
a wall across California Street between
the Mark Hopkins Hotel and the
Fairmont's 'Tonga' room.
Methodically, about 5 0 police
slowly pushed the demonstrators up

California into the intersection where
the entire erowd was then forced to the
sidewalks by police using horses as huge
blocking devices. Observers termed this
sweep the most potentially explosive
incident of the rally because tensions
were mounting between police and
demonstrators.
"There's no telling what might have
happened if the kids or the police lost
their heads," one policeman later
commented. "That could have been the
start of a Godawful street battle."
Tactically Horrendous
"The situation was tactically
horrendous," analyzed one
demonstrator. "The people simply were
in a very tense situation with very few
avenues for escape. It wasn't a good
place for a battle."
Dozens of elderly and middle-aged
people staying in the Mark Hopkins
Hotel were witness to the slow sweep
up California from a balcony
immediately above. Many took pictures
of the confrontation with home movie
equipment and 'Instamatic' cameras.
Many seemed almost disturbingly
unaware of the potential for violence
and strolled calmly to the police lines
to gawk at the demonstrators.

TIS THE SEASON TO BE JOLLY—Furious shoppers were denied the streets yesterday by police oblivious to the Christmas
spirit. Police also managed to thwart furious demonstrators at the Fairmont at the same time.
SAN FRANCISCO—Over 5,000
chanting demonstrators clogged the
streets around San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel yesterday afternoon in
a massive but relatively peaceful
demonstration, as Nguyen Cao Ky,vice
president of South Vietnam, addressed
the Commonwealth Club inside.
Towards the end of the four hour
rally, small bands of demonstrators
provided the only major violence as
they hurled rocks and pieces of
pavement at pursuing police and broke
some windows as they were chased up
California Street.
It was reported that San Francisco
Police Chief Alfred Nelder had called
out 420 men, all but 48 in uniform, to
patrol the demonstration, termed by a
Longshoreman's Union observer as
"potentially a riot or a rally." Mounted
police and helmeted police crime
prevention squad (Tactical Squad)
officers lined Mason Street and the
sidewalk in front of the Fairmont. A
police helicopter circled overhead.
Police Restraint
From most observations, police were
apparently trying to be as restrained as
possible, and did not want to provoke a
major street battle.
A San Francisco Police Department
spokesman said last night that 3 4
youths, aged 15 to 26, were arrested on
charges ranging from assault to failure
to disperse. Roving medical teams also
were reported to have treated 23
demonstrators for injuries suffered in
the latter part of the demonstration.
Serious Headwounds
Two policemen received fairly
serious headwounds. One was struck on

the back of the head with a hammer,
while the other was clubbed repeatedly
on the head with a chunk of pavement
after his helmet had been ripped off.

Street to clear the way for traffic. One
policeman was reported to have ripped
a Viet Cong flag from a woman
demonstrator, with a small crowd
immediately gathering. A group of
police then charged the gathering, and
one Stanford student was struck with a
nightstick, causing a bloody
headwound.
Human Wall
Shortly afterwards hundreds of
marchers broke away from the Mason
and California intersection and formed
a wall across California Street between
the Mark Hopkins Hotel and the
Fairmont's 'Tonga' room.
Methodically, about 5 0 police
slowly pushed the demonstrators up

California into the intersection where
the entire erowd was then forced to the
sidewalks by police using horses as huge
blocking devices. Observers termed this
sweep the most potentially explosive
incident of the rally because tensions
were mounting between police and
demonstrators.
"There's no telling what might have
happened if the kids or the police lost
their heads," one policeman later
commented. "That could have been the
start of a Godawful street battle."
Tactically Horrendous
"The situation was tactically
horrendous," analyzed one
demonstrator. "The people simply were
in a very tense situation with very few
avenues for escape. It wasn't a good
place for a battle."
Dozens of elderly and middle-aged
people staying in the Mark Hopkins
Hotel were witness to the slow sweep
up California from a balcony
immediately above. Many took pictures
of the confrontation with home movie
equipment and 'Instamatic' cameras.
Many seemed almost disturbingly
unaware of the potential for violence
and strolled calmly to the police lines
to gawk at the demonstrators.

THE LONG WAIT—As the yellow light indicates, caution reigned between the
demonstrators and police. The flag waver was later hit with police billy clubs to
remove him from his perch.

spirit. Police also managed to thwart furious demonstrators at the Fairmont at the same time.
SAN FRANCISCO—Over 5,000
chanting demonstrators clogged the
streets around San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel yesterday afternoon in
a massive but relatively peaceful
demonstration, as Nguyen Cao Ky,vice
president of South Vietnam, addressed
the Commonwealth Club inside.
Towards the end of the four hour
rally, small bands of demonstrators
provided the only major violence as
they hurled rocks and pieces of
pavement at pursuing police and broke
some windows as they were chased up
California Street.
It was reported that San Francisco
Police Chief Alfred Nelder had called
out 420 men, all but 48 in uniform, to
patrol the demonstration, termed by a
Longshoreman's Union observer as
"potentially a riot or a rally." Mounted
police and helmeted police crime
prevention squad (Tactical Squad)
officers lined Mason Street and the
sidewalk in front of the Fairmont. A
police helicopter circled overhead.
Police Restraint
From most observations, police were
apparently trying to be as restrained as
possible, and did not want to provoke a
major street battle.
A San Francisco Police Department
spokesman said last night that 3 4
youths, aged 15 to 26, were arrested on
charges ranging from assault to failure
to disperse. Roving medical teams also
were reported to have treated 23
demonstrators for injuries suffered in
the latter part of the demonstration.
Serious Headwounds
Two policemen received fairly
serious headwounds. One was struck on

the back of the head with a hammer,
while the other was clubbed repeatedly
on the head with a chunk of pavement
after his helmet had been ripped off.
Most of the large crowd in front of
the hotel did not participate in the later
violence. Patrolmen on horseback and
Tac Squad police, under a shower of
rocks, eventually chased demonstrators
from a small park, apparently roughing
up several medics in the process. The
demonstrators were then pursued down
the steep side of Nob Hill.
Many of the mounted police
brandished nightsticks in routing
demonstrators from the park, causing
one observer to maintain, "It had all
the elements of a Cossack charge."
Selling Lies
Ky was speaking to about 1,000
members and guests of the
Commonwealth Club when a youth
draped a Viet Cong flag over a balcony
rail of the Grand Ballroom and
shouted, "This man is selling you lies!"
There were immediate cries from the
audience to "Get him out!" and a
plainclothes Secret Service agent
quickly apprehended the intruder.
One guest of the Commonwealth
Club, a young lawyer, later said that
security inside was "awesome." "I was

absolutely afraid of voicing any vocal
opposition to Ky," he declared. "I'm
sure I would have been hustled right
out."
Going Home
Ky, who was en route home
following a series of conferences in
Washington, D.C., flew to San
Francisco at 2:50 a.m. and went
directly to the Fairmont, thus missing
all the morning's demonstrations.
At about 11:30 police began the
first of several sweeps up California
Street to clear the way for traffic. One
policeman was reported to have ripped
a Viet Cong flag from a woman
demonstrator, with a small crowd
immediately gathering. A group of
police then charged the gathering, and
one Stanford student was struck with a
nightstick, causing a bloody
headwound.
