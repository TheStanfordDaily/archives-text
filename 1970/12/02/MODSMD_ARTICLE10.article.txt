# Relief Asked For Pakistani Victims
## 
### 
The night of November 12 will
be remembered as one of the most
tragic in the history of human
suffering caused by natural
disaster. A 15 0-mile-an-hour
cyclone and a 20-foot high tidal
wave lashed the coastal districts
and off-shore islands of East
Pakistan - the world's most
densely populated region.
According to unofficial
estimates:
—More than two hundred and
fifty thousand men, women and
children were killed.
—Over a million heads of cattle
perished.
—Some six hundred thousand
tons of standing rice crops were
ruined.
But these statistics do not
indicate even a fraction of the
actual misery of some three
million survivors. According to a
Reuters report: "More than a
million survivors face death if
relief supplied can not be
delivered to them soon."
Sympathy and help from all
parts of the world has been both
quick and generous. All political
and ideological differences have
been temporarily set aside to rush
food, drinking water, clothing,
medicine and urgently-needed
funds to the disaster area.
But it is felt by all observers of
this unprecedented catastrophe

that all relief funds and supplies
pledged so far fall below the
minimum necessary to save the
survivors. The Secretary General
of the league of Red Cross
Societies said in his appeal: "All
resources of. the World Red Cross
organization and other relief
resources will be required to
prevent this from becoming an
even greater catastrophy through
starvation and the spread of
disease."
At Stanford an East Pakistan
Relief Fund Committee has been
set up with coordinating units at
the International Center and the
ASSU Office in Tresidder Union.
Supported by an appeal from
President Lyman, the Committee
has organized a drive for
donations of money from the
faculty, staff and students on
campus. The Palo Alto Chapter of
the American Red Cross has set
up a unit to receive tax exempt
donations from those who might
find it more convenient to make
their contributions direct to the
Red Cross. On the evening of the
7th of December a benefit
program of international music
will be held in the Stanford
Memorial Church in which
prominent artists from the Bay
Area will contribute their talents
to highlight the plea for more
funds.
