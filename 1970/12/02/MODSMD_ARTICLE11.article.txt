# 'WUSA' Not His Best
## 
### CYNTHIA WEBER 
During a recent interview Paul
Newman stated that "WUSA" is
the most significant film he has
ever made, but not necessarily the
best. I tend to agree with only the
latter part of his statement.
"WUSA" is definitely not
Newman's best film and is
significant only in the fact that it
is the first film in which he has
both acted and directed. The
result of his efforts is a clutter of
cinematic and verbal cliches,
lacking direction and coherence.
Producer-director Newman cast
himself as Rheinhardt, a
"communicator," an alcoholic, "a
master of disguise .. . just trying
to stay alive and human, not
trying to prove anything," who
finds his way to New Orleans and
the heart and bedroom of
Geraldine. Joanne Woodward is
once again perfectly typecast as

the prostitute Geraldine, "too
dumb for the phone company and
too old for the five and dime."
Farley (Lawrence Harvey), a
con-man turned preacher and a
totally inconsequential character,
informs Rheinhardt of a job
available at ultra-reactionary radio
station WUSA as a newscaster and
pitch artist. In between sips from
his thermos of alcohol Rheinhardt
sells the New Patriotism to the
American's America. "Remember.
The future of America is in your
hands."
Meanwhile, Anthony Perkins,
straight from his role in
"PSYCHO," spends his time
roaming the slums of New Orleans
collecting information for what he
thinks is a survey for the welfare
department. Little does the
neurotic, "who would walk
through fire and water for the
Negro race," know that he is

being used by the owners of
WUSA to survey fake welfare
clients as part of the big plan the
station managers have of
discrediting the welfare
department and the U.S.
government.
At a White Power rally staged
by WUSA to extol the principles
of faith, flag, and family, Perkins,
who by this time is wise to the
scheme, attempts to shoot the big
boss but misses his mark and
wounds an aide instead. A riot
ensues in the "MEDIUM
COOL"- 44 STRAWBERRY
STATEMENT" tradition and
heads get busted, including
Geraldine who is found with
marijuana in her purse, planted by
some inane hippie types who keep
appearing in significant
Newman-Woodward
confrontation scenes only to ruin
them with comments like "heavy
scene."
Geraldine finds herself in jail
and meets an untimely death
when she hangs herself. Newman
grieves her death while Neil
Diamond sings "Glory Road" and
exits with 'Tm, a survivor. Ain't
that great?" Not necessarily.
What could have been a
beautiful story about two lost
souls becomes a weak attempt at
exposing all the ills of American
society. Newman admitted that he
had serious differences with
Stuart Rosenberg and took over as
director, but that he would never
again act and direct in the same
picture. Wise decision. I only wish
that he had enough foresight to
realize that an attempt to direct
and act in "WUSA" would be
disasterous.

On the double bill with
"WUSA" at the Varsity in Palo
Alto is an Otto Preminger
Production entitled "TELL ME
THAT YOU LOVE ME JUNIE
MOON." Nice try Otto.
An excellent double feature is
currently showing at the Menlo in
Menlo Park-Bergman's "PASSION
OF ANNA" and Truffaut's
"MISSISSIPPI MERMAID."
