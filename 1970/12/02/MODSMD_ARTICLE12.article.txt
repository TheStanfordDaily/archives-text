# Stunning Graphics At Gallery, Museum
## 
### JEAN L. FINCH 
The opening of the new
University of California Museum
at Berkeley has created so much
razzle-dazzle within the Bay Area
in the past two weeks that it is
almost easy to overlook the art
happenings on our own campus.
That would be a serious mistake
because at the present time there
are two exceptionally smashing
print shows that offer the viewer a
wide range in the medium of the
graphic arts.
In the Stanford Museum, an
exhibition of eighty lithographs
by the nineteenth century French
artist, Guillaume Sulpice
Chevallier, later known as Gavarni
(1804-1866), are on display in the
Miedel Room. The show will run
from Nov. 20, 1 970, to Jan. 10,
19 71. In the Art Gallery, adjacent
to the Cummings Art Building, an
exhibition of German Graphics of
the Nineteenth and Twentieth
Centuries, opened Nov. 6, 1970
and will close Jan. 3,1971.
The Gavarni lithographs were
assembled by the San Francisco
collector and print dealer, R.E.
Lewis and exhibit a refined taste
and a marvelous retrospective of
this important artist's life. It is a
pity that Gavarni has been under
wraps for so long a period but the
Stanford show corrects all of that.
This marks the first major exhibit
of Gavarni in the United States
and the first time that Mr. Lewis's
collection has been available for
public viewing.
The body of Gavarni's work is
devoted to witty and gently ironic
characterizations of the intrigues,
indiscretions and foibles of
Parisian high society in the time
of Louis - Philippe (18 30-18 48).
A few lithographs are scenes from
a stay at the debtor's prison at
Clichy, to which he was sent when
bankrupted by the failure of a
journal he had begun. Others
display the plight of the London

slum dweller and severa' are
portraits of close friends, among
them the Goncourt brothers.
But it is the satirical and
humorous depictions of Parisian
society that are both delightful
and provocative. Gavarni is never
biting nor vitriolic in his work,
but rather, he shares with you
man's foibles and inconsistencies,
and it is this quiet humour plus
the control of his crayon and the
clearly delineated lines and
subtleties that makes Gavarni such
a visual joy.
The show has been sensitively
matted and thoughtfully hung
which adds to the success of
Gavarni's creative ability and Mr.
Lewis's connoisseurship. The
Museum hours are 10-5, Tuesday
through Friday, 1-5 Saturday and
Sunday and closed on Mondays.
In the Gallery, on the other
hand, the eye is immediately
dazzled by the brilliant color and
intriguing designs of the prints of
the young German painters and
sculptors who are also exploring
the new techniques of modern
printmaking. This extensive
collection is on loan from the
Collection of Professor and Mrs.
John H. Merry man of Stanford.
Dazzling is almost an
understatement because the
colours positively glow and no
black and white reproduction
could ever give you the flavour of
this happy combination of impact
colour, clean design and superbly
mounted prints. The only
criticism is a technical one caused
by the reflection of light on the
glass covering the prints. How to
solve the problem is a dilemma in
that non-glare glass is
prohibitively expensive and the
prints must be covered. But this
small problem in no way destroys
the success of the show.
The Gallery hours are Tuesday
through Saturday, 10-5 and 1-5
on Sunday. The Gallery is closed
Mondays.

indiscretions and foibles of
Parisian high society in the time
of Louis - Philippe (18 30-18 48).
A few lithographs are scenes from
a stay at the debtor's prison at
Clichy, to which he was sent when
bankrupted by the failure of a
journal he had begun. Others
display the plight of the London

slum dweller and severa' are
portraits of close friends, among
them the Goncourt brothers.
But it is the satirical and
humorous depictions of Parisian
society that are both delightful
and provocative. Gavarni is never
biting nor vitriolic in his work,
but rather, he shares with you
man's foibles and inconsistencies,
and it is this quiet humour plus
the control of his crayon and the
clearly delineated lines and
subtleties that makes Gavarni such
a visual joy.
The show has been sensitively
matted and thoughtfully hung
which adds to the success of
Gavarni's creative ability and Mr.
Lewis's connoisseurship. The
Museum hours are 10-5, Tuesday
through Friday, 1-5 Saturday and
Sunday and closed on Mondays.
In the Gallery, on the other
hand, the eye is immediately
dazzled by the brilliant color and
intriguing designs of the prints of
the young German painters and
sculptors who are also exploring
the new techniques of modern
printmaking. This extensive
collection is on loan from the
Collection of Professor and Mrs.
John H. Merry man of Stanford.
Dazzling is almost an
understatement because the
colours positively glow and no
black and white reproduction
could ever give you the flavour of
this happy combination of impact
colour, clean design and superbly
mounted prints. The only
criticism is a technical one caused
by the reflection of light on the
glass covering the prints. How to
solve the problem is a dilemma in
that non-glare glass is
prohibitively expensive and the
prints must be covered. But this
small problem in no way destroys
the success of the show.

The opening of the new
University of California Museum
at Berkeley has created so much
razzle-dazzle within the Bay Area
in the past two weeks that it is
almost easy to overlook the art
happenings on our own campus.
That would be a serious mistake
because at the present time there
are two exceptionally smashing
print shows that offer the viewer a
wide range in the medium of the
graphic arts.
In the Stanford Museum, an
exhibition of eighty lithographs
by the nineteenth century French
artist, Guillaume Sulpice
Chevallier, later known as Gavarni
(1804-1866), are on display in the
Miedel Room. The show will run
from Nov. 20, 1 970, to Jan. 10,
19 71. In the Art Gallery, adjacent
to the Cummings Art Building, an
exhibition of German Graphics of
the Nineteenth and Twentieth
Centuries, opened Nov. 6, 1970
and will close Jan. 3,1971.
The Gavarni lithographs were
assembled by the San Francisco
collector and print dealer, R.E.
Lewis and exhibit a refined taste
and a marvelous retrospective of
this important artist's life. It is a
pity that Gavarni has been under
wraps for so long a period but the
Stanford show corrects all of that.
This marks the first major exhibit
of Gavarni in the United States
and the first time that Mr. Lewis's
collection has been available for
public viewing.
The body of Gavarni's work is
devoted to witty and gently ironic
characterizations of the intrigues,
indiscretions and foibles of
Parisian high society in the time
of Louis - Philippe (18 30-18 48).
