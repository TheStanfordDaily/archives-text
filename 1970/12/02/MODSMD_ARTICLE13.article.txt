# Plunkett Ubiquitous
## Football Awards Abound 
### 
The spoils of success roll in.
Quarterback Jim Plunkett and
a number of other Stanford
football players have been picking
up national and regional awards
this week as the Indians continue
their respite from the field before
starting Rose Bowl practices Dec.
12.
Plunkett, who won the
Heisman Trophy last week as the
nation's outstanding player, was
selected by the United Press
International yesterday as
first-team All-American
quarterback.
Plunkett and five of his cohorts
were named earlier to West-Coast
and Pacific-8 honorary teams by
the UPI and the league coaches,
respectively.

According to the UPI, end Bob
Moore, tackle Steve Jubb, center
John Sande, receiver Randy
Vataha and lineman Dave Tipton
are the best in the West.
The press service also selected
John Ralston as West-Coast coach
of the year.
Those earning second-team
honors from the UPI were
defensive back Jack Schultz,
linebacker Jeff Siemon and
lineman Pete Lazetich. Running
back Hillary Shockley and kicker
Steve Horowitz won honorable
mentions.
In the Pac-8 selections, Moore,
Jubb, Vataha, Plunkett and
Tipton repeated on the first team

and Siemon finished in a tie with
Oregon's Tom Graham for
first-string linebacker.
Sande and Schultz were
awarded honorable mentions.
A surprise of sorts was the
selection of UCLA's Dave Dalby
at center ahead of Stanford's
Sande. Sande was top choice of
the coaches last year in the Pac-8
balloting.
In the voting, according to an
informed source, coaches are to
list their players in order of
importance. On Stanford's ballot
Sande was reportedly listed
second behind Plunkett.
UCLA coach Tom Prothro was
said to have ignored his
quarterback, Dennis Dummit,and

listed Dal by first. He also may
have done some informal lobbying
on his center's behalf.
Other players on the Pac-8
offense were Bob New land,
Oregon, end; Bob Richards,
California, tackle; Steve Busch,
WSU, and Ernie Janet,
Washington, guards; Dalby at
center; and Clarence Davis, USC,
and Bobby Moore, Oregon, in the
backfield.
Other Pac-8 players on defense
were Charles Weaver, USC, and
Jim Sherbert, OSU, ends; Craig
Hanneman, Oregon State, Tom
Failla, Washington, and Sherm
White, Cal, on the line; Phil
Croyle, Cal, linebacker; and
Lionel Coleman, Oregon, Cal
Jones, Washington, and Ray
Youngblood, Cal, defensive backs.
Plunkett, who was also named
to Kodak's Ail-American team
and selected by the Pigskin Club
of Washington, D.C. as the
outstanding intercollegiate athlete
for 1970, leaves the campus
tomorrow for New York where he
will receive his Heisman Trophy at
a formal dinner Friday night.
