# Tribe Trips Dons In Opener
## 
### 
Stanford opened its 1970-71
basketball season (last night) with
a 65 -61 victory over USF. Leading
32-25 at half, the Indians let their
lead fray to two points, 60-58
with 2:4 7 left in the game.
Then Card center Mike Michel
hit on a baseline jumper. Neither

team scored again until Michel hit
one of two free throws with 55
seconds to go. A Dennis O'Neill
lay in with 27 seconds left iced the
game for the Indians.
The smaller Indians controlled
the boards with sophomore starter
Pat Stevens leading all rebounders

with 15 grabs. Stanford
out-rebounded the Dons 39-32.
Michel was also impressive in
his first starting assignment at the
center position. He picked up 14
points and was invaluable on
defense. Dennis O'Neill was
outstanding at guard with 13
points, 4 assists, and 4 rebounds.
Stevens and Claude Terry each
scored 11 points to round out a
well-balanced Indian offense.
Senior captain Chuck Moore
tossed in 8 points and came away
with 7 rebounds.
Coach Dallmar went to his
bench early and often as nine
players saw actionâ€”three
sophomores, three juniors, and
three seniors.
While hitting on only 36
percent of its field shots, the
Indians outshot the Dons with 74
attempts to USF's 49. The Cards
hit on only half of their 22 free
throws and made 14 turnovers,
nine in the first half.
Excellent passing and ten
assists by Stanford marked an
effective Indian offense.
