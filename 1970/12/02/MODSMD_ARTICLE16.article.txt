# Poloists Sixth In Finals
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's water poloists
salvaged a sixth place finish in last
weekend's NCAA finals, at Long
Beach. The Indians met San Jose
State in the opener with the
Spartans winning 9-7 on a 5-goal
second quarter effort.
After being eliminated from a
finish in the top four spots, the
Indians met UC Santa Barbara in
the first round of the consolation
draw. UCSB had narrowly lost to
defending champs UCLA in its
opener 7 -6 with the Bruins'
clinching goal coming in the last
minute of play.
In sudden death double
overtime, Stanford managed to
outlast the Gauchos 12-11 after a
2 1/2 hour struggle. This victory
for the Cardinals gave Coach
Gaughran's squad a chance to vie
for fifth place against USC.
Hurt by a fourth quarter
letdown and a Trojan platoon
system, the Indians fell before

Troy 10-7, thus finishing in sixth
place.
Stanford's high point of the
tournament came after 3 :19 had
expired in the sudden death
overtime period against Santa
Barbara. With the score knotted at
11-11, UCSB committed its 60 th
team foul and gave the Indians a
penalty shot from the Gaucho
4-yard line.
With veteran scoring aces Rick
Massimino and Bill Simpkins and
Rob Woolley out of game on
fouls, the burden fell on starting
sophomore stalwart Bob Warren.
Warren looked toward the left
corner and then fired into the
right side of the net.
Stanford had lost all but two
of its starters to foul-outs
including goalie Peter Gadd who
had been ejected on a major foul
in the second half of the first
overtime. Mike Davis replaced
Gadd in the goal and after letting
two shots score, he stopped three

crucial shotsâ€”two in the sudden
death period.
At three different times in the
game, the crowd thought it was all
over. With one second left in the
fourth quarter, the Indians led
11-10. Then Stanford committed
a foul giving the Gauchos the ball
inside the Braves' two-yard line.
Still the game seemed to be over
as Santa Barbara had to find an
open man against a tight Stanford
defense.
Then the Gauchos lobbed the
ball in front of the goal and a
Gaucho forward tipped it in with
no time left giving Santa Barbara a
tie.
Later, all hope seemed lost
when goalie Gadd was thrown out
of the game for interfering after a
penalty shot with the Indians
already trailing by one goal.
Thanks to a pair of scores from
Massimino and a goal by Rob
Jensen, Stanford managed to tie
the game again after the first
overtime.

Defensively, Gadd saved 16 of
25 shots and stopped one crucial
penalty shot. Davis stopped 3 out
of 5 shots in seven minutes of
play.
Leading the Indians in scoring
was Rick Massimino with four
goals and one assist. Mike Davis
threw in three scores before
replacing Gadd in the goal. Warren
scored twice and Simpkins, Rob
Jensen, and Ray Collins tallied
one apiece.
In the opening game, the
Indians played a listless and
sluggish game against San Jose
State falling to the Spartans 9-7.
Five Spartans goals in the second
quarter iced the game for SJ
State.
In the final game, the Indians
hopes disintegrated before a
five-goal Trojan onslaught in the
fourth period. Gadd saved 10 of
20 shots plus one penalty throw.
Davis, Woolley, Simpkins, and
Collins scored a goal each while
Massimino scored three.
