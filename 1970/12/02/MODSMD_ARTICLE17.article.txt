More POW Moves Set
WASHINGTON - Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird said Tuesday the United States "will
make further efforts to free our prisoners" in
North Vietnam, and this includes possible
military action.
"I would not rule out any action," Laird
said. "We are going to make every kind of
effort to free our prisoners of war."
The Pentagon chief made this statement
when reporters asked if there might be another
commando-type raid like the dramatic but
fruitless descent on Son Tay ten days ago.
The Nixon administration is concerned
about the POW issue, Laird said, and he intends
to take it up at a three-day meeting of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers
in Brussels.
His words were echoed in Paris by
Ambassador David K. E. Bruce, chief U.S.
envoy to the Vietnam peace talks there. Bruce
told a news conference the United States will
continue to seek the early release of American
prisoners in Vietnam "by all means available to
us."
"Hanoi and the Viet Cong must understand,
in unmistakable terms," Bruce said, "that their
past and existing attitude on the prisoner of
war question is intolerable. We will continue to
pursue the twin objectives of humane treatment
and early release of our men by all means
available to us."
6 Spy Boat 9 Sunk
TEL AVIV — An Israeli patrol boat sank an
Egyptian vessel that was on a nighttime
intelligence and smuggling mission in the Suez
Gulf, an Israeli military spokesman announced
Tuesday.
The Tel Aviv spokesman said the Egyptian
spy boat was sunk Saturday near the Israeli
shore of the gulf and all four crewmen were
killed. He said he was unable to give a reason
for the delay in announcing the incident.

Documents found on one of the three bodies
recovered proved the Egyptians were engaged in
intelligence work and an investigation showed
they also were smuggling hashish, he said.
It was the first serious incident reported on
the Egyptian front since the Middle East
cease-fire took effect four months ago.
Cairo radio said early Wednesday: "Only
unarmed civilian fishing boats operate in this
area and neither army nor intelligence have any
boats there." It called the sinking "a breach of
the cease-fire and a criminal act against
unarmed civilians."
President Sworn In
MEXICO CITY — Luis Echeverria Alvarez
became president of Mexico on Tuesday with a
pledge "to speed up the march of the Mexican
revolution."
Echeverria was sworn in as the 26 th
constitutionally elected president at a brief
ceremony in the National Auditorium at
Chapultepec Park befores,ooo guests including
official delegations from more than 60
countries.
The new president took the oath of office
administered by Congressman Jose Rivas
Guzman and swore to "faithfully carry out the
duties of the presidency, obey the constitution
and its laws."
"Should I not do it, may the nation hold me
responsible," he said later in his 20-minute
inaugural speech.
In his address, the new president promised
to strengthen relations with the United States
and Guatemala, Mexico's neighbors to the
north and south.
"We are not a walled country," the 48 year
old president said. "Our borders are open to
human, economic and cultural communication.
We wish to strengthen our existing relations
with the United States and Guatemala, on a
basis of mutual respect, spirit of fair play and
real understanding between our peoples."

Labor Alliance Possible
WASHINGTON — Informed labor sources are
voicing strong speculation that the nation's two
largest unions-Teamsters and Auto Workers-will
rejoin the AFL-CIO, possibly within a year.
Such a move would bring virtually all major
unions under one roof for the first time in
nearly 15 years, forming a massive organization
of more than 1 7 million workers.
Nothing is official, and hitches could
develop, but sources point to a number of
major considerations.
One is the desire for stronger labor unity in
the face of what union leaders view as a
basically hostile Republican administration in
the White House despite friendly overtures
from President Nixon.
Another is the death last May of the Auto
Workers' president, Walter Reuther, who left
the AFL-CIO two years ago in a personality
clash with its venerable president, 76 year old,
George Meany.
SST Loses Support
WASHINGTON - A Republican Senator who
usually supports President Nixon's policies
defected from GOP ranks Tuesday and said he
sees no justification for continuing federal aid
to the supersonic transport.
The decision by Sen. Jack Miller, R-lowa,
put in further doubt the fate of a pending $290
million appropriation to continue work on SST
proto-types.
Miller said he will vote against the
appropriation when it comes to the Senate
floor Thursday or Friday.
Miller's action followed two days of activity
in which SST supporters, conceding they face
"an extremely tight vote," moved to blunt the
attack of opponents. They in turn hurled a new
barrage of criticism at the project SST
supporters call the transportation of the future.

to strengthen relations with the United States
and Guatemala, Mexico's neighbors to the
north and south.
"We are not a walled country," the 48 year
old president said. "Our borders are open to
human, economic and cultural communication.
We wish to strengthen our existing relations
with the United States and Guatemala, on a
basis of mutual respect, spirit of fair play and
real understanding between our peoples."

Labor Alliance Possible
WASHINGTON — Informed labor sources are
voicing strong speculation that the nation's two
largest unions-Teamsters and Auto Workers-will
rejoin the AFL-CIO, possibly within a year.
Such a move would bring virtually all major
unions under one roof for the first time in
nearly 15 years, forming a massive organization
of more than 1 7 million workers.
Nothing is official, and hitches could
develop, but sources point to a number of
major considerations.
One is the desire for stronger labor unity in
the face of what union leaders view as a
basically hostile Republican administration in
the White House despite friendly overtures
from President Nixon.
Another is the death last May of the Auto
Workers' president, Walter Reuther, who left
the AFL-CIO two years ago in a personality
clash with its venerable president, 76 year old,
George Meany.
SST Loses Support
WASHINGTON - A Republican Senator who
usually supports President Nixon's policies
defected from GOP ranks Tuesday and said he
sees no justification for continuing federal aid
to the supersonic transport.
The decision by Sen. Jack Miller, R-lowa,
put in further doubt the fate of a pending $290
million appropriation to continue work on SST
proto-types.
Miller said he will vote against the
appropriation when it comes to the Senate
floor Thursday or Friday.
Miller's action followed two days of activity
in which SST supporters, conceding they face
"an extremely tight vote," moved to blunt the
attack of opponents. They in turn hurled a new
barrage of criticism at the project SST
supporters call the transportation of the future.
More POW Moves Set
WASHINGTON - Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird said Tuesday the United States "will
make further efforts to free our prisoners" in
North Vietnam, and this includes possible
military action.
"I would not rule out any action," Laird
said. "We are going to make every kind of
effort to free our prisoners of war."
The Pentagon chief made this statement
when reporters asked if there might be another
commando-type raid like the dramatic but
fruitless descent on Son Tay ten days ago.
The Nixon administration is concerned
about the POW issue, Laird said, and he intends
to take it up at a three-day meeting of North
Atlantic Treaty Organization defense ministers
in Brussels.
His words were echoed in Paris by
Ambassador David K. E. Bruce, chief U.S.
envoy to the Vietnam peace talks there. Bruce
told a news conference the United States will
continue to seek the early release of American
prisoners in Vietnam "by all means available to
us."
"Hanoi and the Viet Cong must understand,
in unmistakable terms," Bruce said, "that their
past and existing attitude on the prisoner of
war question is intolerable. We will continue to
pursue the twin objectives of humane treatment
and early release of our men by all means
available to us."
6 Spy Boat 9 Sunk
TEL AVIV — An Israeli patrol boat sank an
Egyptian vessel that was on a nighttime
intelligence and smuggling mission in the Suez
Gulf, an Israeli military spokesman announced
Tuesday.
The Tel Aviv spokesman said the Egyptian
spy boat was sunk Saturday near the Israeli
shore of the gulf and all four crewmen were
killed. He said he was unable to give a reason
for the delay in announcing the incident.

Documents found on one of the three bodies
recovered proved the Egyptians were engaged in
intelligence work and an investigation showed
they also were smuggling hashish, he said.
It was the first serious incident reported on
the Egyptian front since the Middle East
cease-fire took effect four months ago.
Cairo radio said early Wednesday: "Only
unarmed civilian fishing boats operate in this
area and neither army nor intelligence have any
boats there." It called the sinking "a breach of
the cease-fire and a criminal act against
unarmed civilians."
President Sworn In
MEXICO CITY — Luis Echeverria Alvarez

Chapultepec Park befores,ooo guests including
official delegations from more than 60
countries.
The new president took the oath of office
administered by Congressman Jose Rivas
Guzman and swore to "faithfully carry out the
duties of the presidency, obey the constitution
and its laws."
"Should I not do it, may the nation hold me
responsible," he said later in his 20-minute
inaugural speech.

"Hanoi and the Viet Cong must understand,
in unmistakable terms," Bruce said, "that their
past and existing attitude on the prisoner of
war question is intolerable. We will continue to
pursue the twin objectives of humane treatment
and early release of our men by all means
available to us."
6 Spy Boat 9 Sunk
TEL AVIV — An Israeli patrol boat sank an
Egyptian vessel that was on a nighttime
intelligence and smuggling mission in the Suez
Gulf, an Israeli military spokesman announced
Tuesday.
The Tel Aviv spokesman said the Egyptian
spy boat was sunk Saturday near the Israeli
shore of the gulf and all four crewmen were
killed. He said he was unable to give a reason
for the delay in announcing the incident.

Documents found on one of the three bodies
recovered proved the Egyptians were engaged in
intelligence work and an investigation showed
they also were smuggling hashish, he said.
It was the first serious incident reported on
the Egyptian front since the Middle East
cease-fire took effect four months ago.
Cairo radio said early Wednesday: "Only
unarmed civilian fishing boats operate in this
area and neither army nor intelligence have any
boats there." It called the sinking "a breach of
the cease-fire and a criminal act against
unarmed civilians."
President Sworn In
MEXICO CITY — Luis Echeverria Alvarez
became president of Mexico on Tuesday with a
pledge "to speed up the march of the Mexican
revolution."
Echeverria was sworn in as the 26 th
constitutionally elected president at a brief
ceremony in the National Auditorium at
Chapultepec Park befores,ooo guests including
official delegations from more than 60
countries.
The new president took the oath of office
administered by Congressman Jose Rivas
Guzman and swore to "faithfully carry out the
duties of the presidency, obey the constitution
and its laws."
"Should I not do it, may the nation hold me
responsible," he said later in his 20-minute
inaugural speech.
In his address, the new president promised
to strengthen relations with the United States
and Guatemala, Mexico's neighbors to the
north and south.
"We are not a walled country," the 48 year
old president said. "Our borders are open to
human, economic and cultural communication.
We wish to strengthen our existing relations
with the United States and Guatemala, on a
basis of mutual respect, spirit of fair play and
real understanding between our peoples."

Labor Alliance Possible
WASHINGTON — Informed labor sources are
voicing strong speculation that the nation's two
largest unions-Teamsters and Auto Workers-will
rejoin the AFL-CIO, possibly within a year.
Such a move would bring virtually all major
unions under one roof for the first time in
nearly 15 years, forming a massive organization
of more than 1 7 million workers.
Nothing is official, and hitches could
develop, but sources point to a number of
major considerations.
One is the desire for stronger labor unity in
the face of what union leaders view as a
basically hostile Republican administration in
the White House despite friendly overtures
from President Nixon.
Another is the death last May of the Auto
Workers' president, Walter Reuther, who left
the AFL-CIO two years ago in a personality
clash with its venerable president, 76 year old,
George Meany.
SST Loses Support
WASHINGTON - A Republican Senator who
usually supports President Nixon's policies
defected from GOP ranks Tuesday and said he
sees no justification for continuing federal aid
to the supersonic transport.
The decision by Sen. Jack Miller, R-lowa,
put in further doubt the fate of a pending $290
million appropriation to continue work on SST
proto-types.
Miller said he will vote against the
appropriation when it comes to the Senate
floor Thursday or Friday.
Miller's action followed two days of activity
in which SST supporters, conceding they face
"an extremely tight vote," moved to blunt the
attack of opponents. They in turn hurled a new
barrage of criticism at the project SST
supporters call the transportation of the future.
