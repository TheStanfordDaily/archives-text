# Army Spies On Dissidents

NEW YORK (AP)- NBC Television's
"First Tuesday" reported last night
that U.S. Army intelligence used
undercover agents and electronic
equipment during part of 1968 to
gather information on demonstrators
and protesters as possible trouble
makers.
A reporting team worked for more
than six months gathering material and
said military intelligence personnel
conducted surveillance of events
ranging from the funeral of Martin
Luther King Jr. and the Poor Peoples'
March through the political
conventions and the inauguration of
President Nixon.
An assortment of former intelligence
agents some identifiable and others
with their identity concealed spoke on
the program. Some said they were
instructed to infiltrate student protest

movements. Others said they were
assigned to eavesdrop on meetings or to
count people and the number of mules
in the Poor Peoples' March.
Agents said that information was
gleaned from telephone conversations
and estimated that thousands of
dossiers were compiled about suspected
troublemakers and government
officials, appointed and elected.
The agents' reports were couched in
unemotional tones, but NBC men used
stronger language.
"The United States Army
intelligence spies on the protest
movement in the United States,"
declared host Sander Vanocur. An NBC
reporter quoted an unidentified
informant as describing military
intelligence in 1968 and 1969 as "a
national secret police."
