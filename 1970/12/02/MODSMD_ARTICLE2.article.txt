# Lyman Press Conference
## Campus Meetings Policy Set 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In a statement kicking off his last
weekly press conference of the quarter
President Richard Lyman last night
announced that meetings billed as
"open" must be open to everyone, and
that voluntary groups not adhering to
the new campus policy will not have
access to campus meeting space "for
the remainder of the academic year."
According to the policy, "Any
individual who participates in excluding
any person from an open meeting will
be appropriately charged before the
Stanford .Judicial Council."
In addition, the new policy states
that:
—Any voluntary group seeking to
use University space for a meeting must
state to the person allocating the space
whether tlie meeting is open or closed.
—A meeting that is closed, that is,

limited to members of the group and
specifically invited guests, must be
billed as a closed meeting in all
handbills or announcements advertising
it.
—Any meeting not specifically
declared to be closed both at the time
when space is requested and in
advertisements will be considered open.
Free Expression
Lyman also stated that it would be
"condusive to many-sided debate and
really free expression if lots of people
made it a point to go to
meetings .. . especially meetings of
groups they don't think they're
instinctively in sympathy with.
"The University ought to be a place
where people meet openly and have
open debate and open conflict of
opinion," he said.

Lyman also expressed "real regrets"
to Ray White, the leader of the Free
Campus Movement, who was attacked
and beaten slightly by a group of
radicals Monday night.
"It's almost inevitable," Lyman
continued, "if there's a determination
to commit this kind of criminal act,
that sometimes it will succeed.
Overpolicing University's 'End'
"The difficulty of policing such
affairs is proverbial," he added. "It is
my firmly held belief that overpolicing
is the end of a university."
One questioner referred Lyman to
the reported next-to-final approval
yesterday by a joint meeting of the
Trustee Committees on Buildings and
Grounds and Land Development of the
Master Plan for development of
University lands over the next decade.
The plan, which must now be
approved by a meeting of the entire
Board, reportedly specified a ceiling of
25 00 new housing units, as compared
with a ceiling of 15,0 00 on new jobs
created by the development.
According to Lyman, the current
plan allows for between 25 and 5 0 per
cent subsidized housing units.
Difficulties
He stated that he believed the reason
this 5 0 per cent limit was imposed was
that it would be difficult to "get an
economic mix that would allow the
plan to break even," if there were a
greater percentage of subsidized
housing. He added that "you will also
have difficulties having the kind of
social mix that leads to a truly
integrated neighborhood."
Responding to a question on the
responsibility of the University in the
current housing crisis, Lyman said the
University should set an example and
"do an imaginative job of trying to mix
in all categories of housing" in its plans
for development.
"By so doing," Lyman continued,
"we will increase the benevolent
pressure upon local communities who
have by and large not done anything
about subsidized housing.
"We will be encouraging them to
take the responsibility which is theirs,
and to recognize the fact that we are
contributing to their tax base (by this
development) in a very major way.
"In the last analysis, any solution to
this. . . problem has got to be a
governmental solution. It isn't going to
be done by reverting to the
company-town solution, whereby the
employer provides all the housing lor
his employeesLyman concluded.
