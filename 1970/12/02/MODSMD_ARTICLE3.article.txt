# BSU Member Elected To Top Senate Office
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The ASSU Senate elected Michael
Dawson as Chairman at its first meeting
last night. The black sophomore easily
defeated Herb Borock, 23-7, on the
strength of black and moderate votes.
Dawson stated prior to the balloting
that he would be "as impartial as any
chairman has been in the past." The
remark drew laughter from most of the
senators.
Both Dawson and Borock are not
elected members of the Senate. The
ASSU Constitution does not requre
that the Chairman or Parliamentarian
be senators. Borock was later chosen
Parliamentarian.
Loudin Beam emerged the winner of
a close and somewhat controversial
election for the post of Deputy
Chairman. He defeated Rocky Barber
and John Shoch, the latter in a run-off.
Angry words were exchanged
between several senators when Barber's
moderate and conservative supporters
objected to the count which
eliminated him from the run-off. A
motion for a recount was defeated,
causing Young Republican President
Don Ayer to comment, "... certain
people are afraid to take another vote
because they know their county was
wrorif. . This meeting is the biggest
;-ii'i <.l hit I've ever seen in my life."
v!Â« I'.nnifr.tein, who helped

Dawson make the counts, answered,
"I've voted against Mr. Dawson on
every issue tonight. If you're implying
that we're engineering something up
here, I think you're being rather
ridiculous."
Ayer persisted in his attacks when
Dawson asked if the meeting could
continue. "Since we are not going to
get a fair vote, you may continue any
way you wish."
In other actions, the Senate
postponed discussion on nominations
for student committee positions until
its second meeting next Tuesday.
Several senators requested the
postponement, so that they might study
alleged irregularities in the selection
procedure employed by the Committee
on Nominations.
Requests for incorporat ion as ASSU
organizations by eight student groups
will also be discussed at that meeting.
Incorporation allows organizations to
receive ASSU funds.
Though the Senate appeared to be
divided between black, radical and
moderate-conservative factions, no
cohesive coalition emerged from the
meeting. For example, blacks and
moderates voted together to elect
Dawson and Beam, while a
black-radical combination carried the
motion to delay action on committee
nominations.
