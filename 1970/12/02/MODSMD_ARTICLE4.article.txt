# Police-King Of The Hill
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON FRED MANN 
The Fairmont Hotel was a different place yesterday.
Only a week and a half ago students had jammed the
lobby, doing "give 'em the Axe!" cheers and having drinks
poured down their throats by jolly, friendly — if
somewhat tipsy — alumni. It was Big Game eve.
Yesterday Nguyen Cao Ky had come to speak. A
student would have had trouble getting into the lobby;
hundreds of police were there to see to that.
The students were across the street, separated from the
hotel by two lines of police, one mounted and one
standing — but both helmeted and armed with riot batons.
Inside the hotel, police and Secret Servicemen placed
Ky under some of the tightest security San Francisco has
ever seen. Uniformed officers in riot gear strolled through
the plush lobby before and during the vice president's
speech. All were equipped with nightsticks and visored
helmets even though they worked the inside shift.
Conspicious undercover officers guarded each entrance
to the building, and marched in pairs down every corridor
near the Grand Ballroom, site of the speech. Virtually all

wore grey suits, two-inch wide ties, and closely-cropped
hair. There was not a sideburn in sight.
A few guests of the hotel sat in the lobby watching the
police and anticipating action against the crowds outside.
One couple from Houston said they felt safest sitting near
the police, and away from "those sad kids outisde waving
enemy flags."
Air Of Mystery
Yet everyone in the lobby, even those sympathizing
with the security forces, were kept under surveillance by
Secret Servicemen. There wqs a general air of quiet
mystery throughout the hotel with almost everyone
assuming the man next to him was either a cop or a
potential assassin.
Two floors below, outside the ballroom entrance, the
security forces guarded against uninvited intruders by
stationing 15 men at the door. One demonstrator did
manage to sneak into Ky's speech, waving an NLF flag,
and called Ky a liar.
His success in gaining entrance must be viewed asa
minor miracle, considering the obstacles facing him.
Numerous legitimate reporters, including those from the
Daily, "New World Magazine," and the Washington Post,
were left standing outside with credentials the security
officers considered invalid. Angry writers became even
angrier when the head bouncer ejected a photographer

from the hotel, and then refused to give his hame or badge
number.
Blood Versus Boredom
Outside, the demonstrators milled around. The police
stood their ground. Not much was happening.
But blood can quickly make events lose their boredom
and silliness. When polict attempted to clear an area at the
foot of the hill, a block away from the rally area, one
Stanford student was clubbed heavily.
A week and a half ago, a student had lain on the
sidewalk outside the Fairmont. Too much beer. Now a
Stanford student was also lying on the sidewalk outside
the Fairmont, bleeding.
Lighting Up Joints
The excitment subsided. Demonstrators returned to
their milling and shouting. The police returned to their
standing, occasionally pushing the crowd back.
Still no signs of Ky. We were ready to go home. So
were a lot of people.
This went on for an hour or two. Some people began
lighting up "joints" to break up the tedium.
Yippie War Cry
Then it started. The Yippie war cry was the loudest it
had been in several hours. Mounted police chased 300
demonstrators up the hill. Paving bricks flew towards the
police. One policeman was leaning against a building
holding his bleeding head.
The demonstrators moved up Sacramento Ave., turned
a corner, and built barricades of saw horses and pipe left
lying in the street from a construction project.
An NLF flag was mounted on the barricade. A man
drove up in his Cadillac. He was told to leave, but not
before his windows were shattered. Still another barricade
was errected a few blocks down. There was a Pacific (las
and Electric Company air compressor. Its gas tank was
broken and it was set on fire. Most people thought it
would explode. Many hoped it would.
Screwin' And Droppin'
The fire department came. A couple of rocks hit the
truck. The crowd had disappeared.
II didn't seem to make any sense. A black was
analyzing the situation with one of hid friends:
"Those hippies, they don't know nothin' about
fightin'. All they know anything about is screwin' and
droppin' acid. And then they call us ignorant for not be in'
able to guess the white man's answers on some civil service
exam."
Up at the Fairmont, the police had informed the
demonstrators that their gathering was illegal and ordered
the crowd to disperse. It did so, at the same time
exercising its right of free speech in a fairly critical
analysis of the S.F.P.D. They then left.
The cops were still king of the hill.
