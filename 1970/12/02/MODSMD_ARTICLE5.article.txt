# Indian Children Of The Future Awaken The Past

"We have absorbed their lands into our holding;>. Just so
must we be the responsible custodians of their tragedy. "
—Theodora Kroeber, from Ishi, Last Wild Indian in America
History records the last full-scale all-out battle between
the red man and the white man as the disasterous Ghost
Dance Uprising of 18 90. A combination of naive
determination, a drug-induced mystic belief of invincibility,
and the leadership of an aged Sitting Bull was mercilessly
smashed by the overwhelming power of the U.S. Cavalry.
The Indian, scattered and decimated, consequently faced a
loss of dignity or a loss of identity: being interned on
reservations or assimilating into the victorious white
culture.
The "noble Red man" racial stereotype was bludgeoned
into mythology and persistently romanticised to death.
Notable athletes and war heroes among their humiliated
people received attention and served as reminders that the
original inhabitants of this continent had not gone extinct.
But years went by and the tumultuous twentieth century
neatly erased the Indian issue from the concerns of
Americans.
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian
Affairs cultivated tranquility and assumed jurisdiction and
responsibility for the descendants of Tecumseh, Geronimo,
and Powhatan. The new order permitted flexibility in
balancing a delicate situation. Some were allowed to
continue using the hallucinogens their religion prescribed
and all were exempt from federal income taxes.
All traces of an existence uninhibited by civilization
were ceremoniously ushered out with the slaughterhouse
capture of an emaciated savage called Ishi in 1911, close to
the California Gold Rush boom town called Oroville. This
sole survivor of the fiercely independent Yana tribe
wandered from the rugged Sierra foothills, ancestral home
of his people during two millenuims, into a society which
was to regard him as an oddity and convert him into a
museum display piece.
Children of the Future Awaken
A legacy of defeat and distruction is no deterrant to a
people invoking destiny. "The Indian never actually buried
the hatchet, rather it was wrenched from him by superior
aggressive forces. Pacifism is a noble creed, but to someone
fighting for his life, land, and rights, it provides no hope or
solutions," articulated Barbara, dropout from the
University of Washington and veteran of the "Fort
Laughton Insurrection" and the "Platte Camp Conspiracy."
This defiant and attractive part-Yamatero 21-year old
stood guard on an acre of Federal timberland occupied
since October 25 by Pit River Indians and a diverse
assortment of sympathisers. She and a dozen others
remained vigilantly around a campfire on a crisp
Tuesday—election day—at the junction of California
highways 299 and 4 4 and the gateway to Shasta National

Forest, an astonishing fusion of glacial landscapes and
haughty sugarpines. Due south loomed snow-immersed
Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the east cascaded the
high Sierras, northward flowed the lush Pit River country,
and just two miles in almost unbelievable remoteness lay
Burney.
Battle Lines Drawn
Burney was a logging community straight out of the old
frontier: containing a pool hall-saloon, a branch library,
two institutions of learning, and three times that number of
churches. Breaking through the monotony was the
llag-shrouded, colorfully decorated pizza parlor—converted

into a polling place. The elderly librarian gave assurances
that the local group of Indians, most of whom lived in
A-frame homes and pursued gainful employment like any
other solid citizen, were "passive and respectable, not at all
like the distorted accounts in the newspapers."
This information, by slight investigation, proved to be
far from the truth: part fantasy and part indicative of the
lack of cummunication between the factions, and displayed
the fear present among the unwary white majority.
Tensions had reached the fever pitch a week earlier when
the Battle of Four Corners had raged. An acute
confrontation ensued when over 8 0 national and county
peace officers came to enforce an ultimatum to evict the
hundred-odd squatters and remove their hastily built
quonset hut. Rather than acquiesce to the threat of force,
men, women, and children fought back verbally and

physically, hurling invectives and swinging tree branches.
The violence resulted in 24 arrests, six on felony assault
charges which included most of the tribe's leaders and a
Redding newspaper reporter who apparantly yielded his
objectivity in favor of his emotions.
The Pit River dispute dates to the 185 3 seizure of 3.5
million acres of alleged Indian land by the government. It
had apparently not occured to the prevailing powers that
assuming control of enormous amounts of territory without
the sanction of a treaty would have no repereusiions over a
hundred years later. "Our strength, spirit, and sacrifice are

the rallying cries in reversing the injustices of the white
man," an unidentified stalwart proclaimed.
Militance
As the sun descended on the horizon and the
envigorating mountain air infiltrated the site of the recent
embattlement, the mosaic of the Indians' struggle became
complete. Roy Thundercloud, a full-blooded Assiboine
Sioux, had ventured north from Alcatraz. His stormy life
included 8 years in Montana's penal system and the last 20
or 30 years incessantly wandering across the breadth of the
United States in search of an identity. "1 am the toughest
and meanest Indian you will find," he boasted, half jesting.
His friend Louie was drawn westward from a New York
Mohawk settlement, and most closely fitted into the middle
class white hippie image. A belligerant young Mescelaro

Apache, a soft spoken Cherokee lass of unknown birthplace,
and a handful of indigenous, goodnatured Pit Rivers
completed the group.
Heterogeneity, selfless dedication, and youthfulness
were very evident elements of the uprising. Thirty-one year
old Mickey Gemmill, not far removed in a Sacramento jail,
received his position of tribal spokesman as a result of his
leadership qualities, rather than by heridity. Frequent drug
use among partisans was explained as part of the give and
take propostion wherein elders exchanged the respect which
they demanded for the tolerance they bestowed upon their
children. Apparently a common cause reduced the
generational friction to a bare minimum.
"Militance is becoming a way of life to me and many of
my people," Toy revealed amidst bursts of humerous
obscenities and gulps of whisky. Barbara, whose
aforementioned activities may net her a prison sentence,
philosophized that she was motivated by a faith in "Mother
Earth." Others expressed the feelings that Jesus would have
condoned their actions.
The Power Structure
Although admitting that sporadic uprisings do not
guarantee immediate results, these Indians sense a
resurgence of hope in their movement. Last fall Pacific Gas
and Electric found itself beleagered by an equally
determined group of activists. P.G.&E., besides owning
great expanses of disputed land, enjoys a monopoly on
power and utilities in Northern California. At Hat Creek in
Shasta County they had built a school for ten select
students which included a heated swimming pool, while a
surrounding impoverished, low tax based district
accommodated Indian children. Under severe attack from
the Pit Rivers and many quarters, P.G.&E. has hinted it
might accede to Indian demands.
A female San Francisco State graduate who came back
to join the rekindled struggle emphasized that "pressure
would be brought to bear on all corporations or agencies of
government who are irresponsive to the needs of the people
they purport to serve." Up to this point the tactics have
consisted of dramatic appeals, militant actions, and legal
struggles. It is in the arena of settlement where the true
nature of future happenings will be determined.
Apparently many are prepared for a prolonged series of
confrontations. Chicanos and Indians merged to occupy an
abandoned Army fort near the University of California at
Davis, just recently. Alcatraz is still in the hands of its
invaders and the Pit River incident promises to continue
indefinitely.
To "dramatize (their) contempt for America's symbols,"
the core group of militants seized a huge American flag
draping a voting booth in nearby Burney. Rather than feed
the fire, Louie cloaked himself in Old Glory and executed a
ceremonial dance of victory, while the flagstaff's golden
eagle bobbled around madly in bucolic fashion.

Dance Uprising of 18 90. A combination of naive
determination, a drug-induced mystic belief of invincibility,
and the leadership of an aged Sitting Bull was mercilessly
smashed by the overwhelming power of the U.S. Cavalry.
The Indian, scattered and decimated, consequently faced a
loss of dignity or a loss of identity: being interned on
reservations or assimilating into the victorious white
culture.
The "noble Red man" racial stereotype was bludgeoned
into mythology and persistently romanticised to death.
Notable athletes and war heroes among their humiliated
people received attention and served as reminders that the
original inhabitants of this continent had not gone extinct.
But years went by and the tumultuous twentieth century
neatly erased the Indian issue from the concerns of
Americans.
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian
Affairs cultivated tranquility and assumed jurisdiction and
responsibility for the descendants of Tecumseh, Geronimo,
and Powhatan. The new order permitted flexibility in
balancing a delicate situation. Some were allowed to
continue using the hallucinogens their religion prescribed
and all were exempt from federal income taxes.
All traces of an existence uninhibited by civilization
were ceremoniously ushered out with the slaughterhouse
capture of an emaciated savage called Ishi in 1911, close to
the California Gold Rush boom town called Oroville. This
sole survivor of the fiercely independent Yana tribe
wandered from the rugged Sierra foothills, ancestral home
of his people during two millenuims, into a society which
was to regard him as an oddity and convert him into a
museum display piece.
Children of the Future Awaken
A legacy of defeat and distruction is no deterrant to a
people invoking destiny. "The Indian never actually buried
the hatchet, rather it was wrenched from him by superior
aggressive forces. Pacifism is a noble creed, but to someone
fighting for his life, land, and rights, it provides no hope or
solutions," articulated Barbara, dropout from the
University of Washington and veteran of the "Fort
Laughton Insurrection" and the "Platte Camp Conspiracy."
This defiant and attractive part-Yamatero 21-year old
stood guard on an acre of Federal timberland occupied
since October 25 by Pit River Indians and a diverse
assortment of sympathisers. She and a dozen others
remained vigilantly around a campfire on a crisp
Tuesday—election day—at the junction of California
highways 299 and 4 4 and the gateway to Shasta National

Forest, an astonishing fusion of glacial landscapes and
haughty sugarpines. Due south loomed snow-immersed
Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the east cascaded the
high Sierras, northward flowed the lush Pit River country,
and just two miles in almost unbelievable remoteness lay
Burney.
Battle Lines Drawn
Burney was a logging community straight out of the old
frontier: containing a pool hall-saloon, a branch library,
two institutions of learning, and three times that number of
churches. Breaking through the monotony was the
llag-shrouded, colorfully decorated pizza parlor—converted

into a polling place. The elderly librarian gave assurances
that the local group of Indians, most of whom lived in
A-frame homes and pursued gainful employment like any
other solid citizen, were "passive and respectable, not at all
like the distorted accounts in the newspapers."
This information, by slight investigation, proved to be
far from the truth: part fantasy and part indicative of the
lack of cummunication between the factions, and displayed
the fear present among the unwary white majority.
Tensions had reached the fever pitch a week earlier when
the Battle of Four Corners had raged. An acute
confrontation ensued when over 8 0 national and county
peace officers came to enforce an ultimatum to evict the
hundred-odd squatters and remove their hastily built
quonset hut. Rather than acquiesce to the threat of force,
men, women, and children fought back verbally and

physically, hurling invectives and swinging tree branches.
The violence resulted in 24 arrests, six on felony assault
charges which included most of the tribe's leaders and a
Redding newspaper reporter who apparantly yielded his
objectivity in favor of his emotions.
The Pit River dispute dates to the 185 3 seizure of 3.5
million acres of alleged Indian land by the government. It
had apparently not occured to the prevailing powers that
assuming control of enormous amounts of territory without
the sanction of a treaty would have no repereusiions over a
hundred years later. "Our strength, spirit, and sacrifice are

the rallying cries in reversing the injustices of the white
man," an unidentified stalwart proclaimed.
Militance
As the sun descended on the horizon and the
envigorating mountain air infiltrated the site of the recent
embattlement, the mosaic of the Indians' struggle became
complete. Roy Thundercloud, a full-blooded Assiboine
Sioux, had ventured north from Alcatraz. His stormy life
included 8 years in Montana's penal system and the last 20
or 30 years incessantly wandering across the breadth of the
United States in search of an identity. "1 am the toughest
and meanest Indian you will find," he boasted, half jesting.
His friend Louie was drawn westward from a New York
Mohawk settlement, and most closely fitted into the middle
class white hippie image. A belligerant young Mescelaro

Apache, a soft spoken Cherokee lass of unknown birthplace,
and a handful of indigenous, goodnatured Pit Rivers
completed the group.
Heterogeneity, selfless dedication, and youthfulness
were very evident elements of the uprising. Thirty-one year
old Mickey Gemmill, not far removed in a Sacramento jail,
received his position of tribal spokesman as a result of his
leadership qualities, rather than by heridity. Frequent drug
use among partisans was explained as part of the give and
take propostion wherein elders exchanged the respect which
they demanded for the tolerance they bestowed upon their
children. Apparently a common cause reduced the
generational friction to a bare minimum.
"Militance is becoming a way of life to me and many of
my people," Toy revealed amidst bursts of humerous
obscenities and gulps of whisky. Barbara, whose
aforementioned activities may net her a prison sentence,
philosophized that she was motivated by a faith in "Mother
Earth." Others expressed the feelings that Jesus would have
condoned their actions.
The Power Structure
Although admitting that sporadic uprisings do not
guarantee immediate results, these Indians sense a
resurgence of hope in their movement. Last fall Pacific Gas
and Electric found itself beleagered by an equally
determined group of activists. P.G.&E., besides owning
great expanses of disputed land, enjoys a monopoly on
power and utilities in Northern California. At Hat Creek in
Shasta County they had built a school for ten select
students which included a heated swimming pool, while a
surrounding impoverished, low tax based district
accommodated Indian children. Under severe attack from
the Pit Rivers and many quarters, P.G.&E. has hinted it
might accede to Indian demands.
A female San Francisco State graduate who came back
to join the rekindled struggle emphasized that "pressure
would be brought to bear on all corporations or agencies of
government who are irresponsive to the needs of the people
they purport to serve." Up to this point the tactics have
consisted of dramatic appeals, militant actions, and legal
struggles. It is in the arena of settlement where the true
nature of future happenings will be determined.
Apparently many are prepared for a prolonged series of
confrontations. Chicanos and Indians merged to occupy an
abandoned Army fort near the University of California at
Davis, just recently. Alcatraz is still in the hands of its
invaders and the Pit River incident promises to continue
indefinitely.
To "dramatize (their) contempt for America's symbols,"
the core group of militants seized a huge American flag
draping a voting booth in nearby Burney. Rather than feed
the fire, Louie cloaked himself in Old Glory and executed a
ceremonial dance of victory, while the flagstaff's golden
eagle bobbled around madly in bucolic fashion.

culture.
The "noble Red man" racial stereotype was bludgeoned

Notable athletes and war heroes among their humiliated
people received attention and served as reminders that the

But years went by and the tumultuous twentieth century
neatly erased the Indian issue from the concerns of
Americans.
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian
Affairs cultivated tranquility and assumed jurisdiction and
responsibility for the descendants of Tecumseh, Geronimo,
and Powhatan. The new order permitted flexibility in
balancing a delicate situation. Some were allowed to
continue using the hallucinogens their religion prescribed
and all were exempt from federal income taxes.
All traces of an existence uninhibited by civilization
were ceremoniously ushered out with the slaughterhouse
capture of an emaciated savage called Ishi in 1911, close to
the California Gold Rush boom town called Oroville. This
sole survivor of the fiercely independent Yana tribe
wandered from the rugged Sierra foothills, ancestral home
of his people during two millenuims, into a society which
was to regard him as an oddity and convert him into a
museum display piece.
Children of the Future Awaken
A legacy of defeat and distruction is no deterrant to a
people invoking destiny. "The Indian never actually buried
the hatchet, rather it was wrenched from him by superior
aggressive forces. Pacifism is a noble creed, but to someone
fighting for his life, land, and rights, it provides no hope or
solutions," articulated Barbara, dropout from the
University of Washington and veteran of the "Fort
Laughton Insurrection" and the "Platte Camp Conspiracy."
This defiant and attractive part-Yamatero 21-year old
stood guard on an acre of Federal timberland occupied
since October 25 by Pit River Indians and a diverse
assortment of sympathisers. She and a dozen others
remained vigilantly around a campfire on a crisp
Tuesday—election day—at the junction of California
highways 299 and 4 4 and the gateway to Shasta National

Forest, an astonishing fusion of glacial landscapes and
haughty sugarpines. Due south loomed snow-immersed
Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the east cascaded the
high Sierras, northward flowed the lush Pit River country,
and just two miles in almost unbelievable remoteness lay
Burney.
Battle Lines Drawn
Burney was a logging community straight out of the old
frontier: containing a pool hall-saloon, a branch library,
two institutions of learning, and three times that number of
churches. Breaking through the monotony was the
llag-shrouded, colorfully decorated pizza parlor—converted

into a polling place. The elderly librarian gave assurances
that the local group of Indians, most of whom lived in
A-frame homes and pursued gainful employment like any
other solid citizen, were "passive and respectable, not at all
like the distorted accounts in the newspapers."
This information, by slight investigation, proved to be
far from the truth: part fantasy and part indicative of the
lack of cummunication between the factions, and displayed
the fear present among the unwary white majority.
Tensions had reached the fever pitch a week earlier when
the Battle of Four Corners had raged. An acute
confrontation ensued when over 8 0 national and county
peace officers came to enforce an ultimatum to evict the
hundred-odd squatters and remove their hastily built
quonset hut. Rather than acquiesce to the threat of force,
men, women, and children fought back verbally and

physically, hurling invectives and swinging tree branches.
The violence resulted in 24 arrests, six on felony assault
charges which included most of the tribe's leaders and a
Redding newspaper reporter who apparantly yielded his
objectivity in favor of his emotions.
The Pit River dispute dates to the 185 3 seizure of 3.5
million acres of alleged Indian land by the government. It
had apparently not occured to the prevailing powers that
assuming control of enormous amounts of territory without
the sanction of a treaty would have no repereusiions over a
hundred years later. "Our strength, spirit, and sacrifice are

the rallying cries in reversing the injustices of the white
man," an unidentified stalwart proclaimed.
Militance
As the sun descended on the horizon and the
envigorating mountain air infiltrated the site of the recent
embattlement, the mosaic of the Indians' struggle became
complete. Roy Thundercloud, a full-blooded Assiboine
Sioux, had ventured north from Alcatraz. His stormy life
included 8 years in Montana's penal system and the last 20
or 30 years incessantly wandering across the breadth of the
United States in search of an identity. "1 am the toughest
and meanest Indian you will find," he boasted, half jesting.
His friend Louie was drawn westward from a New York
Mohawk settlement, and most closely fitted into the middle
class white hippie image. A belligerant young Mescelaro

Apache, a soft spoken Cherokee lass of unknown birthplace,
and a handful of indigenous, goodnatured Pit Rivers
completed the group.
Heterogeneity, selfless dedication, and youthfulness
were very evident elements of the uprising. Thirty-one year
old Mickey Gemmill, not far removed in a Sacramento jail,
received his position of tribal spokesman as a result of his
leadership qualities, rather than by heridity. Frequent drug
use among partisans was explained as part of the give and
take propostion wherein elders exchanged the respect which
they demanded for the tolerance they bestowed upon their
children. Apparently a common cause reduced the
generational friction to a bare minimum.
"Militance is becoming a way of life to me and many of
my people," Toy revealed amidst bursts of humerous
obscenities and gulps of whisky. Barbara, whose
aforementioned activities may net her a prison sentence,
philosophized that she was motivated by a faith in "Mother
Earth." Others expressed the feelings that Jesus would have
condoned their actions.
The Power Structure
Although admitting that sporadic uprisings do not
guarantee immediate results, these Indians sense a
resurgence of hope in their movement. Last fall Pacific Gas
and Electric found itself beleagered by an equally
determined group of activists. P.G.&E., besides owning
great expanses of disputed land, enjoys a monopoly on
power and utilities in Northern California. At Hat Creek in
Shasta County they had built a school for ten select
students which included a heated swimming pool, while a
surrounding impoverished, low tax based district
accommodated Indian children. Under severe attack from
the Pit Rivers and many quarters, P.G.&E. has hinted it
might accede to Indian demands.
A female San Francisco State graduate who came back
to join the rekindled struggle emphasized that "pressure
would be brought to bear on all corporations or agencies of
government who are irresponsive to the needs of the people
they purport to serve." Up to this point the tactics have
consisted of dramatic appeals, militant actions, and legal
struggles. It is in the arena of settlement where the true
nature of future happenings will be determined.
Apparently many are prepared for a prolonged series of
confrontations. Chicanos and Indians merged to occupy an
abandoned Army fort near the University of California at
Davis, just recently. Alcatraz is still in the hands of its
invaders and the Pit River incident promises to continue
indefinitely.
To "dramatize (their) contempt for America's symbols,"
the core group of militants seized a huge American flag
draping a voting booth in nearby Burney. Rather than feed
the fire, Louie cloaked himself in Old Glory and executed a
ceremonial dance of victory, while the flagstaff's golden
eagle bobbled around madly in bucolic fashion.

original inhabitants of this continent had not gone extinct.
But years went by and the tumultuous twentieth century
neatly erased the Indian issue from the concerns of
Americans.
The Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian
Affairs cultivated tranquility and assumed jurisdiction and
responsibility for the descendants of Tecumseh, Geronimo,
and Powhatan. The new order permitted flexibility in
balancing a delicate situation. Some were allowed to
continue using the hallucinogens their religion prescribed
and all were exempt from federal income taxes.
All traces of an existence uninhibited by civilization
were ceremoniously ushered out with the slaughterhouse
capture of an emaciated savage called Ishi in 1911, close to
the California Gold Rush boom town called Oroville. This
sole survivor of the fiercely independent Yana tribe
wandered from the rugged Sierra foothills, ancestral home
of his people during two millenuims, into a society which
was to regard him as an oddity and convert him into a
museum display piece.
Children of the Future Awaken
A legacy of defeat and distruction is no deterrant to a
people invoking destiny. "The Indian never actually buried
the hatchet, rather it was wrenched from him by superior
aggressive forces. Pacifism is a noble creed, but to someone
fighting for his life, land, and rights, it provides no hope or
solutions," articulated Barbara, dropout from the
University of Washington and veteran of the "Fort
Laughton Insurrection" and the "Platte Camp Conspiracy."
This defiant and attractive part-Yamatero 21-year old
stood guard on an acre of Federal timberland occupied
since October 25 by Pit River Indians and a diverse
assortment of sympathisers. She and a dozen others
remained vigilantly around a campfire on a crisp
Tuesday—election day—at the junction of California
highways 299 and 4 4 and the gateway to Shasta National

Forest, an astonishing fusion of glacial landscapes and
haughty sugarpines. Due south loomed snow-immersed
Lassen Volcanic National Park, to the east cascaded the
high Sierras, northward flowed the lush Pit River country,
and just two miles in almost unbelievable remoteness lay
Burney.
Battle Lines Drawn
Burney was a logging community straight out of the old
frontier: containing a pool hall-saloon, a branch library,
two institutions of learning, and three times that number of
churches. Breaking through the monotony was the
llag-shrouded, colorfully decorated pizza parlor—converted

into a polling place. The elderly librarian gave assurances
that the local group of Indians, most of whom lived in
A-frame homes and pursued gainful employment like any
other solid citizen, were "passive and respectable, not at all
like the distorted accounts in the newspapers."
This information, by slight investigation, proved to be
far from the truth: part fantasy and part indicative of the
lack of cummunication between the factions, and displayed
the fear present among the unwary white majority.
Tensions had reached the fever pitch a week earlier when
the Battle of Four Corners had raged. An acute
confrontation ensued when over 8 0 national and county
peace officers came to enforce an ultimatum to evict the
hundred-odd squatters and remove their hastily built
quonset hut. Rather than acquiesce to the threat of force,
men, women, and children fought back verbally and

physically, hurling invectives and swinging tree branches.
The violence resulted in 24 arrests, six on felony assault
charges which included most of the tribe's leaders and a
Redding newspaper reporter who apparantly yielded his
objectivity in favor of his emotions.
The Pit River dispute dates to the 185 3 seizure of 3.5
million acres of alleged Indian land by the government. It
had apparently not occured to the prevailing powers that
assuming control of enormous amounts of territory without
the sanction of a treaty would have no repereusiions over a
hundred years later. "Our strength, spirit, and sacrifice are

the rallying cries in reversing the injustices of the white
man," an unidentified stalwart proclaimed.
Militance
As the sun descended on the horizon and the
envigorating mountain air infiltrated the site of the recent
embattlement, the mosaic of the Indians' struggle became
complete. Roy Thundercloud, a full-blooded Assiboine
Sioux, had ventured north from Alcatraz. His stormy life
included 8 years in Montana's penal system and the last 20
or 30 years incessantly wandering across the breadth of the
United States in search of an identity. "1 am the toughest
and meanest Indian you will find," he boasted, half jesting.
His friend Louie was drawn westward from a New York
Mohawk settlement, and most closely fitted into the middle
class white hippie image. A belligerant young Mescelaro

Apache, a soft spoken Cherokee lass of unknown birthplace,
and a handful of indigenous, goodnatured Pit Rivers
completed the group.
Heterogeneity, selfless dedication, and youthfulness
were very evident elements of the uprising. Thirty-one year
old Mickey Gemmill, not far removed in a Sacramento jail,
received his position of tribal spokesman as a result of his
leadership qualities, rather than by heridity. Frequent drug
use among partisans was explained as part of the give and
take propostion wherein elders exchanged the respect which
they demanded for the tolerance they bestowed upon their
children. Apparently a common cause reduced the
generational friction to a bare minimum.
"Militance is becoming a way of life to me and many of
my people," Toy revealed amidst bursts of humerous
obscenities and gulps of whisky. Barbara, whose
aforementioned activities may net her a prison sentence,
philosophized that she was motivated by a faith in "Mother
Earth." Others expressed the feelings that Jesus would have
condoned their actions.
The Power Structure
Although admitting that sporadic uprisings do not
guarantee immediate results, these Indians sense a
resurgence of hope in their movement. Last fall Pacific Gas
and Electric found itself beleagered by an equally
determined group of activists. P.G.&E., besides owning
great expanses of disputed land, enjoys a monopoly on
power and utilities in Northern California. At Hat Creek in
Shasta County they had built a school for ten select
students which included a heated swimming pool, while a
surrounding impoverished, low tax based district
accommodated Indian children. Under severe attack from
the Pit Rivers and many quarters, P.G.&E. has hinted it
might accede to Indian demands.
A female San Francisco State graduate who came back
to join the rekindled struggle emphasized that "pressure
would be brought to bear on all corporations or agencies of
government who are irresponsive to the needs of the people
they purport to serve." Up to this point the tactics have
consisted of dramatic appeals, militant actions, and legal
struggles. It is in the arena of settlement where the true
nature of future happenings will be determined.
Apparently many are prepared for a prolonged series of
confrontations. Chicanos and Indians merged to occupy an
abandoned Army fort near the University of California at
Davis, just recently. Alcatraz is still in the hands of its
invaders and the Pit River incident promises to continue
indefinitely.
To "dramatize (their) contempt for America's symbols,"
the core group of militants seized a huge American flag
draping a voting booth in nearby Burney. Rather than feed
the fire, Louie cloaked himself in Old Glory and executed a
ceremonial dance of victory, while the flagstaff's golden
eagle bobbled around madly in bucolic fashion.

"We have absorbed their lands into our holding;>. Just so
must we be the responsible custodians of their tragedy. "
—Theodora Kroeber, from Ishi, Last Wild Indian in America
History records the last full-scale all-out battle between
the red man and the white man as the disasterous Ghost
Dance Uprising of 18 90. A combination of naive
determination, a drug-induced mystic belief of invincibility,
and the leadership of an aged Sitting Bull was mercilessly
smashed by the overwhelming power of the U.S. Cavalry.
The Indian, scattered and decimated, consequently faced a
loss of dignity or a loss of identity: being interned on
reservations or assimilating into the victorious white
culture.
The "noble Red man" racial stereotype was bludgeoned
into mythology and persistently romanticised to death.
Notable athletes and war heroes among their humiliated
people received attention and served as reminders that the
original inhabitants of this continent had not gone extinct.
