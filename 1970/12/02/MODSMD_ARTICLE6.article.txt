## Guerilla In The Classroom 
### 
The university is like a dresser.
Someone's always running
through its drawers. And people
have been finding more than dirty
underwear. During the 1968 strike
at Columbia, the files were
opened. The newspapers screamed
that the Rembrandt in President
Kirk's office was in danger. But it
was the files.
The files revealed the
university's complicity with the
genocidal policies of the U.S.
imperialists and the university's
direct connection, through its
board of trustees, with the
corporations exploiting people
here and around the world. The
nonsense about academic
"neutrality" was shattered.
The April 3rd Movement, two
years ago at Stanford, was a
similar event. It was the beginning
of a mass anti-imperialist
movement on this campus. The
Columbia discovery has taken us a
long way and sometimes, as we
were reminded by Robert Scheer
at the Stanford War Crimes
Tribunal, we forget to carry it
forward enough.
We have to do that. But what
we have never done is examine the
whole complex of "neutral" ideas
which allow the university to
serve the ruling class. It isn't just a
question of weapons research. The
struggle has to be carried into
each and every classroom.
The struggle in the classroom
has been incredibly slow in getting
it on. Even at the height of last
year's OFF ROTC movement,
schizophrenia set in. The night
time was the right time, the time
for selected trashing and militant
action. And the day time was
another world. People weren't

sure whether they should struggle
in the classroom, be daytime
guerrilla fighters, or simply ignore
it all as "irrelevant." The national
student strike last spring vacillated
between two positions: shutting
the place down or changing it.
Key Question
The key question is whether or
not we believe the university can
ever be made to serve the people.
An evaluation of the third world
studies struggles at S.F. State and
San Mateo State (where Los Siete
came from) and the open
admissions victory at the City
College of New York is crucial to
an understanding of the situation.
I think the university can be
turned around, and the reactions
of the ruling class show their
understanding of that possibility.
If it were impossible to make the
university serve the people, there
wouldn't be such resistance to the
even limited ideological direction
flowing up from students in the
classroom. The spring was simply
bad news for the myth of
academic neutrality, and the
rulers are trying to forstall a
repeat. Recently the Chronicle
warned: "There is a specter
haunting the academic
community-politics-and Professors
must vigorously prevent it from
entering the classroom."
The American Association of
University Professors now says
that it will protect the university.
A spokesman states: "Well, we do,
indeed, care. The university is,
indeed, our baby." The purpose
of this is to set up the purge of
radical faculty and convince
others that the university serves
their interest-that it is, indeed,
their baby.

The purge of radical faculty
and the attack on student dissent
go hand in hand, although the
activities of students are, for us,
primary. The greatest fear they
have is that classrooms be turned
into little Red schoolhouses, that
students function as cadre, and
that they act to transform the
university. The attack on students
uses two weapons: boredom and
open police terror (fascism).
Classrooms try to anesthetize
us and further our alienation from
the material world. How many
times have you fallen asleep this
week. But when that doesn't
work, the police method is used.
John Bunzel, the President of San
Jose State, was once a poli sci
professor at S.F. State. To his
amazement, his first class in the
Winter of 1969 was attended by
100 students.
Many were black and they
didn't dig the overt rascism he was
laying down to oppose the Black
Studies Department. The students
challenged Bunzel. They were
"disruptive." That is, they weren't
anesthetized. So Bunzel solicited
an opinion from a friend in ACLU
who assured him that "academic
freedom" was being violated. The
next class, a student shouted out
and the police came in and
arrested him. As the Palo Alto
Times points out, "The incident
provides an answer as to why
Bunzel today is president of San
Jose State."
Working Class
If the threat of anti-imperialist
ideology in the classroom isn't
enough, the situation of the
working class in the universities in
the last straw. The purpose of the
university has been to take people

away from their roots, to train
working class students for
managerial positions.
The economy, however, has
not done its job and BAsare going
back to where they're coming
from. Professor Roger Freeman of
the Hoover Institute (for War,
Revolution and Peace) has the
answer: "We're in danger of
producing an educated proletariat.
That's dynamite. We have to be
selective on who we allow to go
through." Freeman knows what
the educated proletariat is going
to do back in their community.
They're gonna organize. This
fanaticism which comes out of
Hooverville isn't really out of
whack with the general intent of
Stanford. A school which trains
managers can't keep turning out

the opposite of managers and the
consciousness which goes along
with that.
The struggle in the classrooms
has to get moving. No classroom
and no department is free of
bourgeois ideology. The upcoming
Peoples' Constitutional
Convention is a good special focus
for classroom discussion. The
university must be made to serve
the people. Don't split or give up
on the student movement or its
ability to help change things. By
not struggling here, we are giving
away the resources of the people.
Get it on. Be a guerrilla in the
classroom. A single spark can start
a prairie fire.
