## FBI Intimidation

As the Daily's editorial of November 20 suggests, the pieces of the
picture are indeed strewn all around, yet hardly anybody ever tries to
put them together. It is accurate to say that one should look beyond
isolated incidents. And it is naive to react with surprise to the idea
that the FBI is keeping tabs on certain things. This far I go in agreeing
with the Daily's editorial on the FBI. Beyond this my agreement
seems to fade out, dissipated by what 1 see as a magnification of a
small threat and the failure to notice a larger threat.
One of the major failures in "controlling" violence on campus last
spring was the inability of the administration to identify those who
broke various campus rules. Concerned students whose classes were
disrupted are still trying to identify persons photographed disrupting
those classes.
If the Dean's office had been doing a little file-keeping then the
identification problem would have been much smaller. Yet, as far as
anyone knows there is no such effort in progress. All indications are
that there is a high probability of infractions taking place if some
persons think they can get away with such infractions. This parallels
the situation in regard to federal laws. However, in this case there is
someone doing some file-keeping.
It might not be the nifty computer set-up that the Daily dreams of;
it might just be one agent reading publications and looking up names
in the infamous bane of student radicals, the Stanford Student
Directory; but it does exist. And I'm glad it does.
I want to know that when groups form to discuss the means of
transforming this society by armed revolution, that these groups are
watched. I want some law agency to be ready to apprehend any
organized group which sets out to violate (in this case) federal laws.
There is an abundance of reasons to believe that the Revolutionary
Union is such a group.
A jury or a judge can make a more accurate assessment of
likelihood of guilt and of a reasonable penalty under the law when the
background and attitude of the defendent is known to them. The
availability of such information is important and desirable. When the
probability of legal infractions being perpetrated by certain
individuals and groups is demonstrably high, then the employment by
the public of some agency to accumulate such information is quite
legitimate and justified.
The Daily editorial indicates that the FBI files are most significant
in their alleged effects in intimidating and quieting protest. This is
supposed to make one think of "Free Speech" and react accordingly.
However, if one looks for threats for free speech on campus who is it
that stands out above the rest? Golly-gee it's the old RU gang beating
up photographers and chasing newspaper distributors off campus! If
the FBl's activities serve to intimidate that form of protest (and the
forms of protest which shattered $1 00,00 0 worth of windows and
injured 60 policemen last spring) then I think our free society is
advanced thereby.
