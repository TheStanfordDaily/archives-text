# Shockley Sticks By Race Theories
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Professor William B. Shockley proposes scientific research to
determine whether the genetic potential for intelligence ol black
people differs from whites. Because of his insistence on spreading this
view, he is probably one of the most disliked and controversial figures
on campus, a person many prefer to ignore.
Shockley, who shared a Nobel prize in physics for the development
of the transistor, is not surprised or intimidated. He rarely regrets how
he has said something,and takes great care in expressing himself.
Nevertheless, he says, "I've been misunderstood."
For the past four years he has been campaigning to get the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to go on record supporting his
position that research is urgently needed. According to Shockley, the
committee set up last year to investigate his proposal merely
acknowledged that the study of racial and hereditary differences was
"proper and socially relevant."
Independent Research
Shockley who is 60 years old, has been the Poniatoff Professor of
Enginering Science since 1963 and this position allows him a certain
amount of independence. Since 1966 he has spent much ol his time
investigating dysgenics-"retrogressive evolution through the
disproportionate reproduction of the genetically disadvantaged."
His concern results in part from his estimate that of the 169,000
non-white illegitimate babies born in 1 966, 28 ,000 will develop an IQ
less than 75 . He further calculates that the rate these children are born
will double in less than 2 0 years.
Not only is this effect be more damaging for blacks than whites,
says Shockley, but more published statistics are available on blacks.
His conviction is that facing these questions of dysgenics may be "the
greatest contribution anyone can make to American Negro welfare lor
the next generation."
Joshua Lederberg, chairman of the Department of Genetics, and a
Nobel Prize winner claims Shockley has already made his own
conclusions about black-white differences. "He has chosen to ventilate
his own inflammatory prejudgement of the results of research thinly
disguised as a 'question.' "
However, the crux of Shockley's disagreement with many other
scientists lies in the emphasis he places on heredity, as opposed to
environment, in determining the intelligence and motivation of an
individual.
Heredity More Important
On the nature-nurture argument, he says, "there is one piece (of
evidence) that it's irresponsible not to accept." He states it as follows:
"Heredity is more than twice as important as environment in
determining intelligence as measured by IQ tests in families that adopt
one of a pair of white identical twins."
He does not extrapolate this to the difference in average
intelligence between races. The distribution of black IQ's is offset
downwards by about 15 points from the IQ's of whites. However,
Shockely's opinion is that less than half of this difference is accounted
for by a different environment.
It is a nonfact that simply "blames the Negro IQ deficit on cultural
disadvantages," says Shockely. "There is a whole pattern of
relationships which appear to be explainable far more simply on the
basis of racial genetic differences than in any other way."
He cites evidence which shows that blacks perform better on tests
of verbal skills than they do on reasoning, numerical, or spatial ones,
compared to the relative levels for whites. In addition, he observes
that socially valuable character traits may be correlated with IQ. He
says this correlation "can be four times greater for whites than for
Negroes."
Racial Differences
Shockley submits that these things may be evidence for racial
genetic differences that are not greatly affected by environmental
ones. He has proposed to study this further by comparing the racial
compositions and average IQ's of different black populations living in
uniform slum environments.
This could be done by measuring the frequency of a certain blood
type that is very rare among the Africans from which the blacks came,
but found in 43 per cent of all Caucasians. In a letter to Scientific
American he writes that "my own preliminary research suggests that
an increase of 1 per cent in Caucasian ancestry raises Negro IQ about
one point on the average for low IQ populations."
Putting it mildly, Shockley has raised a very touchy and emotional
issue. Last year, when he went to a conference of the NAS at
Dartmouth to deliver a paper on racial genetic differences, 30 blacks
prevented him from speaking by applauding continuously while he
was on stage.
A writer for The Colonist, published by the BSU here, wrote soon
afterwards that "On the most personal level, Black people should
ignore Shockley ... he is talking about benevolent genocide. Shockley
is saying, 'Nigger you don't stand a chance in our "modern
technological society.' "
And the faculty of the Department of Genetics would certainly
repeat what they said of him in a letter four years ago: "The plain fact
is that we do not know the answers to his provocative questions, and

in our present day context it falls between mischief and malice to
make such a prejudgment in his terms."
Shockley feels this criticism of his motives is unfair. "To fail to use
this method of diagnosis racial composition for fear of being called a
racist is irresponsible. If those blacks with the least amount of
Caucasian genes are in fact the most prolific and also the least
intelligent, then genetic enslavement will be the destiny of their next
generation. The consequences may be extremes of racism and agony
for both blacks and whites."
Shockley's ideas are contested by academicians here in two main
areas. First, they challenge his view that genetic factors pretty well
limit intelligence to the level we observe. This idÂ«>a implies that the
difference in black and white IQ distributions cannot be eliminated
solely by educational means.
Professor Lee J. Cronbach, an expert on educational testing, points
out that the same genes can be expressed in varied manners from one
environment to another. He writes that unlike nutritional
requirements, "the needed ingredients in an educational diet" are not
yet specified.

"If those blacks with the least amount of Caucasian
genes are in fact the most prolific and also the least
intelligent, then genetic enslavement will be the destiny of
their next generation. The consequences may be extremes
of racism and agony for both blacks and whites."
The other area of disagreement is over the possibility of a genetic
basis for racial IQ differences. A member of the Department of
Genetics, suggested in Scientific American that this question "will be
almost impossible to answer satisfactorily before the environmental
differences between U.S. blacks and whites have been substantially
reduced."
Dr. John L. Black, director of the Counselling and Testing Service,
agrees with both views. While the study of racial differences in
intelligence "might be interesting research, this has little practical
significance."
In addition, he is of the opinions that the difference would be far
more difficult to find than Shock ley things. "What little talents we
have might better be put more directly to the solution of educational
problems."
Shockley has replied that these are not good reasons for ignoring
his research proposals. "If you get into an area in which you may find
new facts that are relevant to problems of major concern then that is
sufficient. How these facts may be used, and what the best course is
that may follow from these facts may not be forseeable."
Others are less kind to Shockley's ideas. Joel Hildebrand, Professor
of Chemistry at Berkeley says that the report made to NAS on
Shockley's research proposals was "worthless for the purpose of
making clear to the public that Shockley's proposals are essentially
unscientific and anti-social."
Shockley would refer to this attack as an example of the Speer
syndrome. Albert Speer, a minister of Hitler's cabinet, wrote this in
his memoirs about the "final solution" for the Jews. "Whether I knew
or did not know is totally unimportant when I consider the horrors I
ought to have known about."
