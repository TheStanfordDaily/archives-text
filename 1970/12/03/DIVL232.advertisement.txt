Appeal from STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT Richard W. Lyman:
"Everyone at Stanford is shocked, I know, by news of the extent of the disaster which has struck East Pakistan. Establish
-9 men* of the East Pakistan Relief Fund provides opportunity for members of the University community to show their sympathy
|| to this stricken area by contribution of funds for relief work thai 1 is pathetically needed.
"I hope that everyone who can afford to do so will be as generous as possible in response to this appeal, which has
• been issued by faculty, student and staff members of the East Pakistan Relief Fund Committee.
★ ★ *
Our human concern can be effectively judged by our response to those in need. The plight of the suffering peoples in Pakistan
has been made known to all of us. An individual sacrifice in their behalf is the minimum each person can give. I hope this com
munity will make a significant contribution Thursday evening.
