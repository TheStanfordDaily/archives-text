# Carnegie Commission Designates Stanford In Financial Difficulty

### FRANK MILLER 
The Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education is issuing a special report this
morning on financial crises in
universities and lists Stanford among a
nui..ber of schools "in financial
difficulty."
The report, written by Dr. Earl
Cheit of Berkeley, is being released this
morning at 11 a.m. (EST) in New York.
After studying 41 colleges, Cheit
concludes that in the midst of a
financial crisis unmatched in its impact
in any previous period of
history—many universities are
continuing to operate only through the
sacrifice of some of the programs and
services normally considered important
to their missions. The report fears that
an alarming number of other schools
are headed in the same direction.
President Richard Lyman
announced Monday a $6 million cut in
the University's operating budget by
1975. He said the cut was due primarily
to increased inflation and reduced
federal aid and added that the quality
of education would not be effected by
the long-range belt tightening.
The Carnegie report warns that a
college classified as being in "financial
difficulty" does not warrant a
judgment about the quality of its
programs or administration. In fact, the
report indicates, it could be that an
institution is doing relatively more than
others to maintain quality while
bringing its income and expenditures
into balance.

The report divides the 41
institutions visited into three
classifications: those headed for
financial trouble, those not in trouble,
and those in financial difficulty. Eleven
of the 41 schools, including Stanford,
University of California at Berkeley,
New York University, and San Diego
State College are listed as being in
"financial difficulty."
Based on the sampling, Cheit
concludes that nationally some 1,000
institutions enrolling four million
students (5 6 percent of the total
number of students) are "heading for

financial trouble." He adds that
another 540 institutions enrolling 1.6
million (21 percent) students are
considered "in financial difficulty" and
800 institutions enrolling about 1.7
million students (23 percent) are
considered "not in trouble."
Dr. Cheit is a professor of business
administration at Berkeley and a
former executive vice chancellor for the
campus.
The commission has issued several
controversial reports recently dealing
with medical school education and
revision of the college degree structure.

AFTERMATH—The top of Hoover Tower looks embarrassingly bare without its decorative concrete ball. A lightning bolt
which hit the tower at 6 :3 0 a.m yesterday knocked the 300-pound ball 285 feet to the ground, shattering it into pieces which
flew as far as 5 0 feet, and the impact made a hole six inches deep in the pavement of the parking lot. It was rumored that
several young males were fighting for sourvenir pieces of the famed phallic symbol.
