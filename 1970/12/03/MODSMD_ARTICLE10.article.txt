# New Policy May Expand War
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The
Nixon administration has
expanded its policy on air attacks
against North Vietnam in what
appears to be a deliberate strategy
of increasing pressure on the
enemy while continuing U.S.
troop withdrawals.
Officials report a toughening
attitude by administration leaders
toward North Vietnam over the
past months. The basic policy line
was set forth by Nixon in a speech
last April 30 to which some
diplomatic officials now direct
attention.
He accused the North
Vietnamese of intransigence in the
peace negotiations, "massive
military aggression" in Laos and
Cambodia and an increase in
attacks in South Vietnam to raise
the American casualty rate.
Almost immediately Nixon's
words were reinforced by action.
The North Vietnamese had shot
down a plane escorting a U.S.
reconnaissance plane, which also
was damaged.

By May 4 about 5 00 U.S.
fighters and bombers carried out
what the Defense Department
called "protective reaction
strikes" against North Vietnam.
Two weeks ago a second
massive raid was carried out
against North Vietnamese targets
after a lapse of six months. Again
an American plane had been shot
down and a series of U.S. raids
resulted on November 2 0-21.
Then on November 30 a U.S.
pilot flying patrol on the
Laos-North Vietnameae border
attacked a missile site in North
Vietnam after determining
through his electronic gear that it
was tracking an American combat
plane over Laos.
There was a similar attack last
September on a North Vietnamese
radar-controlled anti-aircraft
missile base.
Some informed officials agree
these strikes, ranging from single
plane to 5 00-plane actions, define
the slow development of a policy

which could stop where it is,
revert to only punitive attacks for
shooting down reconnaissance
aircraft, or expand further into
frequent selective operations
against North Vietnamese
positions.
What the operations should
show Hanoi, Washington officials
say, is Nixon's readiness to move
beyond the previous bounds of
policy if he thinks the enemy is
trying to take advantage of the
restraints implicit in the U.S.
policy of Vietnamization and
troop withdrawal.
