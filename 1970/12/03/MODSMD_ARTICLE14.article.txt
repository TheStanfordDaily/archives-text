## 
### 
Six Boy Scouts and two leaders
from a University troop were
rescued by helicopter yesterday
morning. They were found in
good health at a rugged camp in
the Big Sur area where they had
been trapped for four days by the
flooded Carmel River.
The boys and their leaders
made camp Friday night about six
miles from Los Padres Dam and
remained there eating chocholate
and sardines and huddling
together for warmth until rescued.
When they realized they were
trapped by the swollen river, the

youths laid out an air rescue
symbol near their camp—a large X
formed from orange tarpaulins.
Parents of the boys, who had
been waiting word in the Big Sur
Ranger Station, met the boys at
the Carmel airport.
The boys are: Cooper Chao,
son of Prof, and Mrs. Chi-Chang
Chou; Tom Moser, son of Mrs.
and Mrs. Thomas Moser; Kirk
Stoddard, son of Mr. and Mrs.
Richard Stoddard; Noel Langle,
son of Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Langle; and Jerry Van Kessel, son
of Mr. and Mrs. Anthony Van
