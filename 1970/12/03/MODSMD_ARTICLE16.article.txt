# New Heroin Film Unique
## 
### CURTIS SIREN 
Darkness, Darkness, by Phil
DeGuere and John Norris.
Produced by Nolan, Wilton, and
Wootten, Inc. 327-7272

An unusual new film has been
produced this autumn in Palo
Alto, and already high school
students are seeing it, as part of
their schools' drug education
programs. Darkness, Darkness is
unique in that its cast of
characters are all closely involved
with heroin use. There isn't an
authority figure in sight during its
36 minutes. Just young local
heroin users and (in one scene)
their parents, talking about
themselves and heroin's meaning
in their lives. Five of the users
shown go beyond talking. They
firmly establish their own
credentials as heroin experts by
preparing big doses and shooting
up, for the cameras.
The film was born last April in
the minds of its four
co-producers, Michael Nolan, Ron
Wilton, and Ben Wootten, all 27,
and Bill Reed, 23. Alarmed over
the cancerous growth of the use
of addictive drugs among young
people, the four had reviewed the
existing drug-education media and
found serious inadequacies. They
decided on a more direct, but as
yet untried, approach to the
problem. They would produce a
film about one illegal drug,
heroin. Not all the filmmakers
believe all drugs are harmful, but
all could publicly agree that
heroin is the drug that's most
dangerous and most subject to
misuse. Through their personal
contacts they met past and
present users and asked them to
appear in the film.
Users who wanted to appear
were interviewed (off-camera) by
John Norris, 23, who is listed in
the credits as a "director" but
who can more accurately be
described as "staff psychologist."
In the personal opinion of
producer Bill Reed, Norris was the
most indispensable man
connected with the film, "a
genius. He really knows how to
get close to people, and get them
to open up and talk about
themselves." Norris himself does
not appear on the screen,
although the relaxed and candid
talk of the film's "actors" is in
response to the directors' gentle
questioning. The "shooting up"
scenes, under Norris' direction,
are normal, everyday behavior in
the users' lives, rather than acts of
rebellion.
The filmmakers chose to take
their cameras to locations familiar
to the cast members, rather than
bring the cast to the controlled
but intimidating environment of a
studio. For example, 22-year-old
Alan is shown painting his sailboat
at the Yacht Harbor; sailing the
boat on the Bay; and later,
furtively shooting up heroin in the
bedroom of his Palo Alto home.
In a separate scene in the living
room of his home, Alan's parents
quietly but tearfully describe the
gradual polarization that split the
family and forced Alan into drug
addiction. The final scene of the
film is set on a hillside in the
Santa Cruz mountains where
Gurdie, the film's one former
addict, sits and talks about the

year he spent in isolation in the
mountains, kicking his habit.
Selling, Job
Filming, sound mixing, and
editing were finished sooner than
expected, and the producers had a
final print in their hands in
September, only six months after
work had begun. They looked
around for an established film
distributor to market their
unusual production, but found
none willing to risk it at a less
than exorbitant price. So, they
took onto themselves the huge job
of writing and circulating
descriptive literature to service
and fraternal organizations and
school districts around the
country. Response raised this way
has been "very satisfactory," but
by far the best selling job is done
by the film itself. Realizing this,
the filmmakers now spend long
hours on the road, traveling from
one California school district to
the next, showing their
production to teachers, principals,
board members, and whoever else
might be interested in purchasing
or renting it.
Locally, interest is strong.
Some teachers have had the film
shown to their junior high and
high school classes, even before
district officials have made
purchase decisions. At Cubberley
High, Family Life Education
teacher Ron Anderson invited
producer Reed to visit three of his
classes and answer students'
questions after the showings.
Anderson anticipated that
closer-than-usual attention would
be paid to the new film. He wasn't
disappointed. But even he was
surprised to observe the flashes of
recognition among his students,
when familiar faces appeared on
the screen.
Questions asked Reed revealed
considerable sophistication
regarding drug use. The students
didn't bother to ask, for example,
how the users shown got involved

with heroin in the first place, or
how much the habit costs.
Instead, their questions were more
on the order of "Aren't you
worried about the legal aspect of
being in a place where heroin is
used?" and "How much did the
film cost you to make?" Reed
fielded all questions
conscientiously, paying as close
attention to the students'
jxjmments as he did to their
questions.
Manual
Ultimately, the film must stand
or fall on its own, without a
knowledgable "interpreter" to
lead a discussion after a screening.
In anticipation of this, Nolan,
Wilton, Wootten, and Reed
prepared a 2 2-page typewritten
manual containing short
biographies of the people in the
film, and answering most of the
questions that a mixed (youth and
adult) audience would be likely to
ask about drug addiction. The
manual is intended to be used as
an adjunct to the film, providing
concrete facts and figures and an
up-to-date glossary of drug users'
slang.
Beyond the immediate task of
distributing and showing
Darkness, Darkness to as many
people as possible, the filmmakers
have no firm plans. They hope
next spring to resume using their
frank and direct filming style in
approaching some other topic of
current concern, barbiturate use
perhaps, or venereal disease. Both
of these rival heroin use as
growing problems among white,
middle-class Midpeninsula youth,
and are problems about which
existing educational media,
technically accurate as they may
be, are obsolete and unconvincing.
Next spring's plans, of course,
depend on the reception this
autumn's film gets; on whether
Darkness, Darkness is as
enlightening as the film crew has
tried to make it.

Ultimately, the film must stand
or fall on its own, without a

lead a discussion after a screening.
In anticipation of this, Nolan,
Wilton, Wootten, and Reed
prepared a 2 2-page typewritten
manual containing short
biographies of the people in the
film, and answering most of the
questions that a mixed (youth and
adult) audience would be likely to
ask about drug addiction. The
manual is intended to be used as
an adjunct to the film, providing
concrete facts and figures and an
up-to-date glossary of drug users'
slang.
Beyond the immediate task of
distributing and showing
Darkness, Darkness to as many
people as possible, the filmmakers
have no firm plans. They hope
next spring to resume using their
frank and direct filming style in
approaching some other topic of
current concern, barbiturate use
perhaps, or venereal disease. Both
of these rival heroin use as
growing problems among white,
middle-class Midpeninsula youth,
and are problems about which
existing educational media,
technically accurate as they may
be, are obsolete and unconvincing.
Next spring's plans, of course,
depend on the reception this
autumn's film gets; on whether
Darkness, Darkness is as
enlightening as the film crew has
tried to make it.

An unusual new film has been
produced this autumn in Palo
Alto, and already high school
students are seeing it, as part of
their schools' drug education
programs. Darkness, Darkness is
unique in that its cast of
characters are all closely involved
with heroin use. There isn't an
authority figure in sight during its
36 minutes. Just young local
heroin users and (in one scene)
their parents, talking about
themselves and heroin's meaning
in their lives. Five of the users
shown go beyond talking. They
firmly establish their own
credentials as heroin experts by
preparing big doses and shooting
up, for the cameras.
The film was born last April in
the minds of its four
co-producers, Michael Nolan, Ron
Wilton, and Ben Wootten, all 27,
and Bill Reed, 23. Alarmed over
the cancerous growth of the use
of addictive drugs among young
people, the four had reviewed the
existing drug-education media and
found serious inadequacies. They
decided on a more direct, but as
yet untried, approach to the
problem. They would produce a
film about one illegal drug,
heroin. Not all the filmmakers
believe all drugs are harmful, but
all could publicly agree that
heroin is the drug that's most
dangerous and most subject to
misuse. Through their personal
contacts they met past and
present users and asked them to
appear in the film.
Users who wanted to appear
were interviewed (off-camera) by
John Norris, 23, who is listed in
the credits as a "director" but
who can more accurately be
described as "staff psychologist."
In the personal opinion of
producer Bill Reed, Norris was the
most indispensable man
connected with the film, "a
genius. He really knows how to
get close to people, and get them
to open up and talk about
themselves." Norris himself does
not appear on the screen,
although the relaxed and candid
talk of the film's "actors" is in
response to the directors' gentle
questioning. The "shooting up"
scenes, under Norris' direction,
are normal, everyday behavior in
the users' lives, rather than acts of
rebellion.
The filmmakers chose to take
their cameras to locations familiar
to the cast members, rather than
bring the cast to the controlled
but intimidating environment of a
studio. For example, 22-year-old
Alan is shown painting his sailboat
at the Yacht Harbor; sailing the
boat on the Bay; and later,
furtively shooting up heroin in the
bedroom of his Palo Alto home.
In a separate scene in the living
room of his home, Alan's parents
quietly but tearfully describe the
gradual polarization that split the
family and forced Alan into drug
addiction. The final scene of the
film is set on a hillside in the
Santa Cruz mountains where
Gurdie, the film's one former
addict, sits and talks about the

year he spent in isolation in the
mountains, kicking his habit.
Selling, Job
Filming, sound mixing, and
editing were finished sooner than
expected, and the producers had a
final print in their hands in
September, only six months after
work had begun. They looked
around for an established film
distributor to market their
unusual production, but found
none willing to risk it at a less
than exorbitant price. So, they
took onto themselves the huge job
of writing and circulating
descriptive literature to service
and fraternal organizations and
school districts around the
country. Response raised this way
has been "very satisfactory," but
by far the best selling job is done
by the film itself. Realizing this,
the filmmakers now spend long
hours on the road, traveling from
one California school district to
the next, showing their
production to teachers, principals,
board members, and whoever else
might be interested in purchasing
or renting it.
Locally, interest is strong.
Some teachers have had the film
shown to their junior high and
high school classes, even before
district officials have made
purchase decisions. At Cubberley
High, Family Life Education
teacher Ron Anderson invited
producer Reed to visit three of his
classes and answer students'
questions after the showings.
Anderson anticipated that
closer-than-usual attention would
be paid to the new film. He wasn't
disappointed. But even he was
surprised to observe the flashes of
recognition among his students,
when familiar faces appeared on
the screen.
Questions asked Reed revealed
considerable sophistication
regarding drug use. The students
didn't bother to ask, for example,
how the users shown got involved

with heroin in the first place, or
how much the habit costs.
Instead, their questions were more
on the order of "Aren't you
worried about the legal aspect of
being in a place where heroin is
used?" and "How much did the
film cost you to make?" Reed
fielded all questions
conscientiously, paying as close
attention to the students'
jxjmments as he did to their
questions.

work had begun. They looked
around for an established film
distributor to market their
unusual production, but found
none willing to risk it at a less
than exorbitant price. So, they
took onto themselves the huge job
of writing and circulating
descriptive literature to service
and fraternal organizations and
school districts around the
country. Response raised this way
has been "very satisfactory," but
by far the best selling job is done
by the film itself. Realizing this,
the filmmakers now spend long
hours on the road, traveling from
one California school district to

production to teachers, principals,
board members, and whoever else
might be interested in purchasing
or renting it.
Locally, interest is strong.
Some teachers have had the film
shown to their junior high and
high school classes, even before
district officials have made
purchase decisions. At Cubberley
High, Family Life Education
teacher Ron Anderson invited
producer Reed to visit three of his
classes and answer students'
questions after the showings.
Anderson anticipated that
closer-than-usual attention would
be paid to the new film. He wasn't
disappointed. But even he was
surprised to observe the flashes of
recognition among his students,
when familiar faces appeared on
the screen.
Questions asked Reed revealed
considerable sophistication
regarding drug use. The students
didn't bother to ask, for example,
how the users shown got involved

with heroin in the first place, or
how much the habit costs.
Instead, their questions were more
on the order of "Aren't you
worried about the legal aspect of
being in a place where heroin is
used?" and "How much did the
film cost you to make?" Reed
fielded all questions
conscientiously, paying as close
attention to the students'
jxjmments as he did to their
questions.
Manual
Ultimately, the film must stand
or fall on its own, without a
knowledgable "interpreter" to
lead a discussion after a screening.
In anticipation of this, Nolan,
Wilton, Wootten, and Reed
prepared a 2 2-page typewritten
manual containing short
biographies of the people in the
film, and answering most of the
questions that a mixed (youth and
adult) audience would be likely to
ask about drug addiction. The
manual is intended to be used as
an adjunct to the film, providing
concrete facts and figures and an
up-to-date glossary of drug users'
slang.
Beyond the immediate task of
distributing and showing
Darkness, Darkness to as many
people as possible, the filmmakers
have no firm plans. They hope
next spring to resume using their
frank and direct filming style in
approaching some other topic of
current concern, barbiturate use
perhaps, or venereal disease. Both
of these rival heroin use as
growing problems among white,
middle-class Midpeninsula youth,
and are problems about which
existing educational media,
technically accurate as they may
be, are obsolete and unconvincing.
Next spring's plans, of course,
depend on the reception this
autumn's film gets; on whether
Darkness, Darkness is as
enlightening as the film crew has
tried to make it.

An unusual new film has been
produced this autumn in Palo
Alto, and already high school
students are seeing it, as part of
their schools' drug education
programs. Darkness, Darkness is
unique in that its cast of
characters are all closely involved
with heroin use. There isn't an
authority figure in sight during its
36 minutes. Just young local
heroin users and (in one scene)
their parents, talking about
themselves and heroin's meaning
in their lives. Five of the users
shown go beyond talking. They
firmly establish their own
credentials as heroin experts by
preparing big doses and shooting
up, for the cameras.
The film was born last April in
the minds of its four
co-producers, Michael Nolan, Ron
Wilton, and Ben Wootten, all 27,
and Bill Reed, 23. Alarmed over
the cancerous growth of the use
of addictive drugs among young
people, the four had reviewed the
existing drug-education media and
found serious inadequacies. They
decided on a more direct, but as
yet untried, approach to the
problem. They would produce a
film about one illegal drug,
heroin. Not all the filmmakers
believe all drugs are harmful, but
all could publicly agree that
heroin is the drug that's most
dangerous and most subject to
misuse. Through their personal
contacts they met past and
present users and asked them to
appear in the film.
Users who wanted to appear
were interviewed (off-camera) by
John Norris, 23, who is listed in
the credits as a "director" but
who can more accurately be
described as "staff psychologist."
In the personal opinion of
producer Bill Reed, Norris was the
most indispensable man
connected with the film, "a
genius. He really knows how to
get close to people, and get them
to open up and talk about
themselves." Norris himself does
not appear on the screen,
although the relaxed and candid
talk of the film's "actors" is in
response to the directors' gentle
questioning. The "shooting up"
scenes, under Norris' direction,
are normal, everyday behavior in
the users' lives, rather than acts of
rebellion.
The filmmakers chose to take
their cameras to locations familiar
to the cast members, rather than
bring the cast to the controlled
but intimidating environment of a
studio. For example, 22-year-old
Alan is shown painting his sailboat
at the Yacht Harbor; sailing the
boat on the Bay; and later,
furtively shooting up heroin in the
bedroom of his Palo Alto home.
In a separate scene in the living
room of his home, Alan's parents
quietly but tearfully describe the
gradual polarization that split the
family and forced Alan into drug
addiction. The final scene of the
film is set on a hillside in the
Santa Cruz mountains where
Gurdie, the film's one former
addict, sits and talks about the

year he spent in isolation in the
mountains, kicking his habit.

Filming, sound mixing, and
editing were finished sooner than
expected, and the producers had a
