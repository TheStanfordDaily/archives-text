# Disappointing Operas
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
The sudden cancellation of the opening-night
Tosca seems now to have been ominous for the
remainder of the 1 9 70 season; what is more, the
problems have arisen in the critical roles of Tristan
and Otello. Thus, the productions of Tristan und
Isolde by Wagner and Verdi's Otello—where the
sublime was at least theoretically in reach—have
fallen short. Still, both operas displayed splendid
virtues which made up in part for some vagarious
vocal cords.
The great attraction of the season's Tristan, of
course, was the reigning Wagnerian soprano of the
decade, Birgit Nilsson. Nilsson accomplished the
almost inconceivable feats of making Tristan a
first-act opera and producing a dramatic tour de
force of the kind which has seemed virtually
forbidden by modern conventions of Wagner
staging. There will never be a definitive Isolde, yet
for the moment Nilsson's portrayal obliterates all
other possibilities.
When Jon Vickers cancelled his debut as Tristan
(for reasons muddied by rumor) the reigning
Heldentenor of the previous decade, Wolfgang
Windgassen, agreed to abandon semi-retirement for
these emergency Tristans. Windgassen's long career
commands respect, but age (he is approaching GO)
has sorely restricted his vocal power, calcified his
dramatic presence, and reduced his appeal as the
ultimate operatic version of the romantic lover. It is
a melancholy matter that Windgassen was forced to
make his first (and, surely, last) San Francisco
appearance at this very dim twilight of his career.
The unevenness of the lovers, then, weakened the
opera's total effect, especially in the
Liebesnacht—where the grim suspicion that Nilsson
was holding back in deference to Windgassen never
vanished. Tristan's long death-scene seemed even
longer than usual, but fortunately all longeurs were
dispelled by Nilsson's brilliant Liebestod.
Excellent voices filled the secondary roles.
William Dooley's debut as Kurwenal showed much
confidence and vigor in a role which requires little
in the way of subtlety. Bass Giorgio Tozzi turned in
his second fine role of the season as King Marke: if
Tozzi is not awarded the role of Sachs in next year's

new Meistersinger there is no justice.
If we must resign ourselves to the hopelessness of
getting a Karajan or Boehm for Wagner in S.F.,
perhaps the Opera has found a very competent
exponent of Wagner from the second echelon in
Otmar Suitner. The cohesive and acute results he
has achieved in Siegfried and Tristan have
measurably brightened the prospects of the
complete Ring Cycle in 1972.

Much interest this season has been focused on
designer-director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's new
production of Verdi's greatest tragic opera Otello.
Happily, Ponnelle's finesse and sense of
style—established beyond cavil on the comic side
with this year's Cosi fan tutte—are transferable to
the more profound demands of human cataclysm.
Ponnelle's sets play off massive, somber,
rough-hewn rows of arches against brilliant
costumes and crimson and white drapery. As usual,
it gradually became clear that the director's
conception of the opera infused everything on
stage—the advantage of putting all non-musical
matters in the hands of one man.
James McCracken has been succeeding as Otello
at least since he sang the role here in 1 964. For (wo
acts he equalled his recent recording of the role, but
then disaster struck and he was forced to continue
with severely restricted capabilities. McCracken has
always had a unique kind of voice production, and
there is the terrible possibility that his technique is
catching up with him. At any rate, the audience
reacted to this disappointment courteously, and it is
indeed something of a tribute to McCracken's
mesmerizing dramatic presence that he was able to
hold the audience in thrall without his high register.
Raina Kabaivanska sang a pristine, musically
faultless Desdemona. She presented a beautiful
figure as well as an ingratiating, wholesome voice.
The admirable sound of the chorus highlighted
this week's announcement that its director
Francesco Prestia has been rehired for next season.
As with his earlier Salome, Bohumil C.regor
conducted to no groat effect—either good or bad.
The feeling lingers that the musical terrain he
created was less rugged than Verdi had intends

Much interest this season has been focused on
designer-director Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's new
production of Verdi's greatest tragic opera Otello.
Happily, Ponnelle's finesse and sense of
style—established beyond cavil on the comic side
with this year's Cosi fan tutte—are transferable to
the more profound demands of human cataclysm.
Ponnelle's sets play off massive, somber,
rough-hewn rows of arches against brilliant
costumes and crimson and white drapery. As usual,
it gradually became clear that the director's
conception of the opera infused everything on
stage—the advantage of putting all non-musical
matters in the hands of one man.
James McCracken has been succeeding as Otello
at least since he sang the role here in 1 964. For (wo
acts he equalled his recent recording of the role, but
then disaster struck and he was forced to continue
with severely restricted capabilities. McCracken has
always had a unique kind of voice production, and
there is the terrible possibility that his technique is
catching up with him. At any rate, the audience
reacted to this disappointment courteously, and it is
indeed something of a tribute to McCracken's
mesmerizing dramatic presence that he was able to
hold the audience in thrall without his high register.
Raina Kabaivanska sang a pristine, musically
faultless Desdemona. She presented a beautiful
figure as well as an ingratiating, wholesome voice.
The admirable sound of the chorus highlighted
this week's announcement that its director
Francesco Prestia has been rehired for next season.
As with his earlier Salome, Bohumil C.regor
conducted to no groat effect—either good or bad.
The feeling lingers that the musical terrain he
created was less rugged than Verdi had intends
The sudden cancellation of the opening-night
Tosca seems now to have been ominous for the
remainder of the 1 9 70 season; what is more, the
problems have arisen in the critical roles of Tristan
and Otello. Thus, the productions of Tristan und
Isolde by Wagner and Verdi's Otello—where the
sublime was at least theoretically in reach—have
fallen short. Still, both operas displayed splendid
virtues which made up in part for some vagarious
vocal cords.
The great attraction of the season's Tristan, of
course, was the reigning Wagnerian soprano of the
decade, Birgit Nilsson. Nilsson accomplished the
almost inconceivable feats of making Tristan a
first-act opera and producing a dramatic tour de
force of the kind which has seemed virtually
forbidden by modern conventions of Wagner
staging. There will never be a definitive Isolde, yet
for the moment Nilsson's portrayal obliterates all
other possibilities.
When Jon Vickers cancelled his debut as Tristan
(for reasons muddied by rumor) the reigning
Heldentenor of the previous decade, Wolfgang
Windgassen, agreed to abandon semi-retirement for
these emergency Tristans. Windgassen's long career
commands respect, but age (he is approaching GO)
has sorely restricted his vocal power, calcified his
dramatic presence, and reduced his appeal as the
ultimate operatic version of the romantic lover. It is
a melancholy matter that Windgassen was forced to
make his first (and, surely, last) San Francisco
appearance at this very dim twilight of his career.
The unevenness of the lovers, then, weakened the
opera's total effect, especially in the
Liebesnacht—where the grim suspicion that Nilsson
was holding back in deference to Windgassen never
vanished. Tristan's long death-scene seemed even
longer than usual, but fortunately all longeurs were
dispelled by Nilsson's brilliant Liebestod.
Excellent voices filled the secondary roles.
William Dooley's debut as Kurwenal showed much
confidence and vigor in a role which requires little
in the way of subtlety. Bass Giorgio Tozzi turned in
his second fine role of the season as King Marke: if
Tozzi is not awarded the role of Sachs in next year's

new Meistersinger there is no justice.
If we must resign ourselves to the hopelessness of
getting a Karajan or Boehm for Wagner in S.F.,
perhaps the Opera has found a very competent
exponent of Wagner from the second echelon in
Otmar Suitner. The cohesive and acute results he
has achieved in Siegfried and Tristan have
measurably brightened the prospects of the
complete Ring Cycle in 1972.
