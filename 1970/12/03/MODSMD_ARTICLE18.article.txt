An hour after the Heisman Trophy announcement when the sports
information department was still caught in the initial ebullience,
injured basketball center Larry Rosenzweig limped into the office, his
metal crutches bowed under their 6-10 burden.
"Say Bob," he said to sports information director Bob Murphy,
"since you helped Plunkett get the Heisman Trophy, do you think
you can make me an All-American center?"
Murphy looked first at the knee in the cast, then up at the face
towering above. "Basketball has been cancelled," he joked back.
They played the opener the other night and a couple thousand
people showed up to see just what Stanford's basketball team would
be like without a big center.
That Stanford won was a surprise—if you pay any attention to the
prognosticators. Another was that the starting USF center, 6-11 Ron
Dahms, wasn't around very long.
What happened was that Mike Michel, five inches shorter, drew
him outside early and was firing with ease from the top of the key.
The Dons had to counter with a smaller, more mobile defender.
The Indians played raggedly, but one point was clear: what they
lacked in height they seemed to make up for with scrappy, crisp play.
Tuesday they were playing pressure defense, stealing passes and
hitting the open man on the fast break.
Captain Chuck Moore and sophomore Pat Stevens are players who
know how to get the most from their 6-4 height; the perimeter
shooting of Dennis O'Neill and Claude Terry is proven good, even if it
didn't show Tuesday; and Pat Rusco and Fred Green provide good
depth.
Ron Dahms, of course, may not be one of the best big men
around, and it is still assumed that Stanford will have trouble with
good, big centers. And the Indians will probably have trouble against
an agile pressing defense, too.
So if you're interested only in the scoreboard maybe it won't be
your year. But if you watch basketball for the thrill of the speed and
the beauty of physical finesse, it may well be an interesting season.
