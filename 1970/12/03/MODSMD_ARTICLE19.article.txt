# Oaks Defeat Tribe; McIlvaine Injured
## 
### 
A decisive 6-3 loss Tuesday
night cost Stanford's club ice
hockey team a share of first place
and the services of one of its top
offensive players.
Freshman winger Will
Mcllvaine, clubbed over the head
near the end of the clash with the
league-leading Belmont Oaks, was
resting in satisfactory condition at
Stanford Hospital Wednesday and
probably won't play for the rest
of the season.
Mcllvaine, who was treated
with artificial respiration at the
Belmont Ice rink, was taken by
ambulance to San Mateo General
Hospital where he was treated
with the intensive care unit.
He was transferred to Stanford
Hospital Wednesday morning.
The Indians, who went into the
game tied for first place with
Belmont in the Bay Area Hockey
League, stayed with the Oaks into
the third period when the score
was tied 3-3.
Belmont pulled away with
three goals and moved into first
place alone with a 5-1 record.
Stanford is now 4 -2.
Tom Bedford scored two goals
for the Tribe and Paul Tittman
drilled in the other.
Bedford's first score was
unassisted; then Tittmann took
assists from Pat Baldwin and Ed

Leonard to cut Belmont's lead to
3-2. Bedford knotted the score
early in the final period with
assists from Doug Adams and
Rich Jaros.
The injury to Mcllvaine came
just a week after center Dave
McCaffrey suffered a mild
concussion in Stanford's 5-3 win
over the Berkeley Juniors.
