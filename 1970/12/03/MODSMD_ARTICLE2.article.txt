# Master Plan Given Initial OK; Committee Member Dissents
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Preliminary approval of a University
Land Use Master Plan was given
Monday by a combined meeting of the
Trustee Land Development and
Building and Grounds Committees.
Although the plan reportedly was
passed by voice vote with no
opposition, one committee member
later told the Daily, "Once a single firm
was chosen to the exclusion of
community imput and faculty
expertize the output was a foregone
conclusion."
The report, which will probably be
given final approval and be sent to the
full Board in February, was prepared
by regional planner Larry Livingston. It
gives several alternatives for future
development of Stanford lands.
Although the final version of the
plan has not been released, according to
Manager of Real Estate Boyd Smith,
"It will go to the Board in substantially
the same form as approved, with a few
minor changes."
In the recent past the primary
concerns about the Master Plan
involved the development of housing,
industry and office buildings, or open
space. The present plan lists a range of
housing developments anywhere from
zero to 25 00 units; and a range of job
increases from 8 000 to 15000 jobs over
a 20-year period.
Too Early For Comment
Another committee member said he
was concerned about how the report
might be implemented. "There are
several alternatives listed. If one set is
used it would be fine, if the other is
used it would just further worsen the
housing crisis. The flexibility of the
report leaves open the dangerous
condition where we could build more
industry than a comparable amount of
housing."
Smith, when questioned about these
objections, told the Daily, "The way I
look at it is that since it hasn't been
approved by the full board of trustees,
I feel that it's premature to discuss the
plan. I think it's too bad that they
commented on it prior to review and
approval of the full board."
The committee members both
expressed concern over how other
committee members would react to
their speaking out. Said one, "I hope
you won't use my name, but I do feel
pretty strongly that the Stanford
Community should know what is going
on when a question affecting the
community so directly as its future
physical shape is being decided.
Two Objections
"I have two main objections. First,
there wasn't nearly enough input from
members of the Stanford Community.
A team of experts from right here
could be put together which would do

a much better job than a single planner
can. When you have something as major
as the Land Use Master Plan, and when
you have the world's foremost
authorities its strange that you don't
use their expertise.
"Second, with the present procedure
where the trustees hire a single firm to
do the study, that firm is under
pressure to please the trustees since
they are paying for it. Any type of

imaginative approach is just not going
to happen.
"One trouble with our committees,
which are not made of experts, is that a
consultant can put together facts and
figures and dazzle the trustees with his
footwork.
"The report is flexible because it is
so general, but it doesn't really explain
the impact on the community of
various alternatives."
