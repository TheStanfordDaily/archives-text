# Dance Enthusiasm Creates Crowding
## 
### 
Stanford's Dance Department
isn't. That is, not officially.
Instead, there is one full-time
contemporary dance instructor
whose office may be found over
in the Women's P.E. department,
and four jam-packed modern
dance classes. It is to the credit of
Miss Inga Weiss that large numbers
of students continue to squeeze
into her crowded classes.
Last year it looked for a while
as if the demand of students for a
larger dance program might be
answered. Part-time instructors
from the Bay Area and Stanford
were invited to teach a few extra
classes, and there was talk of a
graduate dance program.
This would have meant the
presence of various dance talents
on campus from whom students
could learn different techniques
of, and approaches to, modern
dance.
But then the budget cutbacks
took hold, and the "Stanford
Dance Department" went the way
of SRT and the Drama
Department—with one difference:
the Dance Department was cut
down before it ever had a chance
to be built up.

When asked why she stayed at
a university that all but ignored
her profession (she was formerly
lead dancer with the Mary
Wigman Company in Germany),
Miss Weiss answered that at least
at Stanford she is able to take an
active teaching role.
The people presently enrolled
in her four modern dance classes
are glad she feels this way, despite
the result of her popularity:
participating in a movement class
with 35 other people.
At least one innovation has
made life easier for devoted
dancers at Stanford. Until this
year, a student could receive
credit for only twelve Women's
P.E. units toward graduation.
That meant a four-year student
could not take more than one P.E.
class (which dance is considered)
per quarter. Thanks to a decision
made this quarter by the
faculty-student Registrar's
Advisory Committee, students
may now count any number of
P.E. classes toward graduation if
those classes are given for more
than one unit.
The advanced dance classes are
now offered for two units and
thus meet this new requirement.


DANCER: Anne Graham, a
graduate student working on a
PhD. in sociology, has been active
in Stanford's contemporary dance
program during the past three
years. Before coming here, she
danced at Washington University
in St.Louis. Students enrolled in
advanced dance classes can get
two units of academic credit this
year under a new ruling.

Stanford's Dance Department
isn't. That is, not officially.
Instead, there is one full-time
contemporary dance instructor
whose office may be found over
in the Women's P.E. department,
and four jam-packed modern
dance classes. It is to the credit of
Miss Inga Weiss that large numbers
of students continue to squeeze
into her crowded classes.
Last year it looked for a while
as if the demand of students for a
larger dance program might be
answered. Part-time instructors
from the Bay Area and Stanford
were invited to teach a few extra
classes, and there was talk of a
graduate dance program.
This would have meant the
presence of various dance talents
on campus from whom students
could learn different techniques
of, and approaches to, modern
dance.
But then the budget cutbacks
took hold, and the "Stanford
Dance Department" went the way
of SRT and the Drama
Department—with one difference:
the Dance Department was cut
down before it ever had a chance
to be built up.

When asked why she stayed at
a university that all but ignored
her profession (she was formerly
lead dancer with the Mary
Wigman Company in Germany),
Miss Weiss answered that at least
at Stanford she is able to take an
active teaching role.
The people presently enrolled
in her four modern dance classes
are glad she feels this way, despite
the result of her popularity:
participating in a movement class
with 35 other people.
At least one innovation has
made life easier for devoted
dancers at Stanford. Until this
year, a student could receive
credit for only twelve Women's
P.E. units toward graduation.
That meant a four-year student
could not take more than one P.E.
class (which dance is considered)
per quarter. Thanks to a decision
made this quarter by the
faculty-student Registrar's
Advisory Committee, students
may now count any number of
P.E. classes toward graduation if
those classes are given for more
than one unit.
The advanced dance classes are
now offered for two units and
thus meet this new requirement.


DANCER: Anne Graham, a
graduate student working on a
PhD. in sociology, has been active
in Stanford's contemporary dance
program during the past three
years. Before coming here, she
danced at Washington University
in St.Louis. Students enrolled in
advanced dance classes can get
