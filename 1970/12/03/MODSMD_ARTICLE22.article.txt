Army Pot Survey Out
WASHINGTON — More than 5 3 percent of Army enlisted
men polled in a "benchmark" survey admitted using
marijuana at least once and one in six said they used it 200
or more times yearly, the Army said Wednesday.
The survey, taken a year ago in Vietnam, showed 4 6.5
percent of the enlisted men polled believe marijuana should
be legalized and 27 percent declared they would continue
using it.
The survey results were unveiled before a Senate
subcommittee on alcholism and narcotics.
Capt. Morris D. Stanton, chief of the psychology section
at Ft. Meade, Md., told the senators he surveyed 2,372
men—ranging from private to lieutenant colonel—at a Cam
Rahn Bay replacement battalion in November 1 969.
Dr. Stanton, who said he believes his statistics are
probably underestimates because of the reluctance of a
drug user to admit, even confidentially, an illegal act, said
1.5 percent of the troops surveyed said they used marijuana
for the first time in Vietnam.
And he said his study revealed a "noticeable increase" in
the percentage of heavy and habituated marijuana users
compared with the only other similar study taken two
years before.
Witness Pleads Fifth
FT BENNING, Ga. — A My Lai veteran of Lt. William
Calley Jr.'s Charlie Company platoon yesterday became
the first witness at his court-martial to invoke the Fifth
Amendment against self incrimination and refused to
testify.
The witness, Allen Boyce, 22, of Bradley Beach, N.J.,
had been listed in published reports as present when Calley
allegedly directed the execution of at least 30 Vietnamese
civilians along trail inside My Lai March 16,1968.
At the request of defense, trial judge Col. Reid Kennedy
ordered the court cleared of newsmen and spectators until
the resumption Thursday of Calley's court-martial. Lawyers
remained to debate the question on what punishment
Kennedy might adjudge against Boyce or, in the event the

witness changed his mind, what areas of his testimony
might legitimately be covered by his rights against self
incrimination.
After less than an hour behind closed courtroom doors,
lawyers emerged and told newsmen Kennedy had taken the
entire matter under advisement with no ruling expected
before Thursday.
Oil Companies Fined
NEW ORLEANS — Three major oil companies were fined
more than half a million dollars in federal court Wednesday
after pleading "no contest" to charges that they failed to
have safety valves on some offshore oil wells in the Gulf of
Mexico.
The three companies—Humble Oil Co., Union Oil Co.,
and Continental Oil Co.—each received the maximum fine
of $2,000 for each count in the indictments.
A fourth company, Shell Oil Co., which is currently
fighting a blazing offshore oil well fire, pleaded innocent
and U.S. District Judge Fred J. Cassiery said he would set a
trial date later.
Tate Suspect Surrenders
LOS ANGELES — Bruce Davis, a member of Charles
Manson's hippie-style family sought since last April on
murder charges, surrendered to police yesterday.
Meanwhile, a defense attorney in the Sharon Tate murder
trial remained missing for a third day.
The bearded, barefoot Davis, 27, was embraced joyfully
by about a dozen Manson family members who have been
camped outside the Hall of Justice while their leader and
three women followers are being tried on
murder-conspiracy charges in the slayings of Miss Tate and
six others.
Two defense attorneys in the Tate trial, Paul Fitzgerald
and Daye Shinn, were waiting on the corner with two
homicide detectives as Davis walked up with a young
woman.
