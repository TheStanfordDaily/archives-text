# Harvard Cuts Possibilities; Three Here On Prexy List

### PHIL LIND 
The names of three men associated
with Stanford now remain on a list of
candidates for the presidency of
Harvard University.
David Hamburg, Wolfgang Panofsky,
and Donald Kennedy are included
among 23 men on the new list, which
has been reduced from a list of 69
names announced on November 20.
Hamburg is chairman of the Medical
School's Department of Psychiatry and
chairman of the faculty's Presidential
Search Committee last summer.
Panofsky is director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and
Kennedy is chairman of the
Department of Biological Sciences.
The original list of 69 names was
described by the Harvard Crimson a
week ago as the "final list of
contenders." However, three names
have been added to the new list.
Scott Jacobs of the Crimson stated
that the new list of 23 is the final list,
and that no new names will be added.
"What you can say about this list
that you couldn't say about the other is
that it's a legitimate working list, which
means it's very unlikely that someone
not on this list will be picked as
President," Jacobs said.
Only Kennedy was available for
comment on the presidential search. "I
think the Harvard Corporation is a long
way from a small list of candidates,"
Kennedy said. "They are proceeding
quite carefully."
"As it stands now, the 23 people
being examined have not necessarily
been asked about their candidacy," he
added.

Discussing his own candidacy,
Kennedy stated, "I think I'm a very
unlikely candidate. I haven't had
enough administrative experience and I
haven't been close to Harvard in about
15 years."
The new and shorter list "omits all
public figures," according to an article
in the Crimson. Harvard, with 11
candidates on the list, has by far the
largest representation of any one
university.
According to Kennedy, "It seems
likely that a man close to Harvard will
be the choice."
The list places heavy emphasis on
nominees from the fields of economics
and science, according to Jacobs.
