# New Policy Questioned On Procedural Grounds
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
Controversy has been aroused by
President Lyman's statement about
open and closed meetings issued
Tuesday.
Several persons have raised questions
as to whether Lyman is circumventing
the Student Conduct Legislative
Committee by issuing such a policy.
The policy statement stems from the
eviction of Professor John Schwartz
from a meeting of the New Left Project
on November 24.
It states that meetings billed as
"open" must be open to everyone, and
that voluntary groups not adhering to
the new campus policy will not have
access to campus meeting space "for
the remainder of the academic year."
(See ad on page 2 for text.)
"In addition," the statement says,
"any individual participating in the act
of excluding any person from an open
meeting will be appropriately charged
before the SJC." Most of the criticism
of the statement has been provoked by
this sentence.
Those who feel that the statement
circumvents the SCLC regulations point
out that the President cannot legally
regulate student behavior. This can
only be done by the SCLC, except in
emergency situations. They claim that
the Presidant is attempting to take over
the functions of the SCLC by making
new laws.
However, according to James Siena,
Legal Counsel to President Lyman,
Lyman's statement is not a new piece
of legislation and therefore not within
the province of the SCLC.
Disruption Violation
Siena feels that students who evict
persons from open meetings will be
charged with violation of the Campus
Disruption Policy, which prohibits any
member of the University from
obstructing the legitimate movement of
any person about the campus.
According to Siena, Lyman's
statement was merely an explanation of
specific times when students can be
charged with the disruption policy.
Siena could not think of any

precedent for issuing a statement which
details specific times when the
administration intends to prosecute
under the Disruptions Policy.
Objection
Christine Swent, a member of the
SJC, strongly objects to Lyman's
statement.
She says,"I consider the policy
statement completely invalid under
established judicial standards because it
did not go through the SCLC, nor was
it issued under the provisions for
emergency legislation. President Lyman
has undermined the entire judicial
system."
Pat C. Shea, member of the Council
of Presidents and of the SCLC,
expressed similar feelings. He stated, "I
think this legislation would have been
better if it had been done through the
SCLC.
"It seems like a precedent-setting
action which can open up a Pandora's
box of trouble.
Konrad Krauskopf, Chairman of the
SCLC, feels that Lyman's statement is
valid. He stated, "I was called and
informed that the policy would be
issued.
"I gave it as my personal opinion
when I was called that the matter
should not be brought before the
SCLC."
