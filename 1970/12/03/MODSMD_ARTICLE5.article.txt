# Communes Popular Among Middle Class Youth
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Eight hundred years ago, as the Roman
Empire crumbled around them, a small
vanguard of Italians turned away from the
decaying institutions of their state and searched
for a new way of life based on smaller, more
personal grouping of people. These new groups
were called communes.
Today, many believe another empire is
wobbling, and communal living is again rising as
an alternative to the traditional family and
social structures. The challenge is peaceful,
growing from within the system, and is gaining
most of its following from the white middle
class of America.
The number of communes in the United
States has doubled or even tripled in the past
five years. Forty states now have at least one
permanent communal group. In Palo Alto,
estimates from forty to fifty communes are
considered accurate.
At the hear* of most communal groups is a
belief that communal living offers the
individual an opportunity to control at least
thypersonal aspect of his life—an opportunity
commune members think does not exist in the
American middle class institutions.
"Communal living breaks the mould that
middle class values and institutions build
around the individual," a Stanford Medical
School student in a fourteen member house
commented. "The alternate values of the
commune are a means by which the individual
can break away from, or handle the established
institutions."
"A meaningful relationship between self and
anyone else other than parents and lovers has
b<>en cut off," another Stanford graduate
student noted, "but at least we're groping for a
future that will do away with impersonality."
Communes are almost exclusively white and
middle clmw. and thoir rise is not directly

connected with any political affiliation or
attitude. Jill Joseph, a Stanford graduate who
lives in a seven-member commune, describes the
communal alternative as "a middle class
privilege." She noted that "communes are
probably not the wave of the future because
they don't solve the political and social
problems of the poor and the blacks."
Perhaps communes are not the wave of the
Third World's future, but they certainly loom
large in the futures of the middle class young.
The changes a commune offer the middle
class are subtle and widespread. Most important
is the de-emphasif of specialized, vertical
scrambles up and down the social ladder.
Individual ambitions are re-channeled toward a
better understanding of personal feelings and a
wide variety of personalized activities.
Living in a commune requires the
adjustment of personalities, so that one is able
to find pleasure in being an essential part of
small tasks with few people, as opposed to the
traditional necessity of finding contentment in
being an insignificant contributor to a large
organization.
Adjustment Required
Mills Mattheison, a Stanford graduate
student in the Medical School, described the
communal adjustment. "You've got to find a
more revealing association with other people in
the commune," he said, "I can't want to bean
associate professor at a large eastern University.
Hut the commune offers me a way to grow my
own medical school and in that way control my
life."
Jill Joseph agrees. "Communes offer the
potential to be crummy at half a dozen things,
and enjoy it."
There is permanence in the communal
organization that reflects the kind of

commitment most commune members have to
their new life style. Most of the participants in
the Palo Alto communes expect to remain here
for a long time. The leader of one four-year old
commune predicted, "I think my house, with
its thirteen members, will always be
functioning. We started with only four people
three years ago and now we've grown to
thirteen. We haven't looked for people on the
move though. Most of us are committed to
living this style for the rest of our lives."
Others Show Interest
Neverland, a twenty-one-member commune
in Menlo Park, gets at least one letter a week
inquiring about possible openings. "We write
back and tell the people what we're doing, that
we're saving money to move to the country,
and that we plan to spend the rest of our lives
together," one Neverlander said, "and most
people don't respond after that."
Even some married couples have made
long-term commitments to the communal
alternative. Jill and Steven, with their
five-month-old son Matthew, live in a
seven-person commune in Palo Alto. "The
commune has forced us to re-examine our
relationship together as parents," Steven
admits, "we've had to grow up personally."
Of Matthew's future, Jill prophesized,
"Hopefully he'll have a lot of models to learn
from. 1 think that's a positive thing in terms of
growth. Maybe he won't have to go through the
same problems we did adjusting. Also, he's lots
less of a burden on Steven and me. The baby
hasn't changed our life styles very much since
before we had him."
Leaders Optimistic
The Iraders of Palo Alto's communes are
optimistic about the future of their movement.
"I'm interested in building something in

society," Mills Mattheison smiled, "I'm
convinced that we don't have to tear down
society to make change. Sooner or later I'll
have to stand up to defend what we've created
here, but I'll feel good about that."
Mills and other commune leaders will be
standing up a lot sooner than later. Not
everyone in the larger community is receptive
to the idea of having the communal alternative
springing up next door to their alternative.
A Palo Alto city ordinance makes it illegal
for more than four unrelated persons to be
living together in the same house. Three weeks

ago, the Palo Alto Human Relations
Commission, a body that sets Palo Alto's
housing ordinances, rejected a proposal to lift
the four-person limit on non-related residences,
thereby opening the door to increased civil
action against the local communes.
Through the efforts of neighbors and the
city attorney, the communes have come under
increasing pressure to move out of the
residential zones of Palo Alto. At present, the
conflict between these two forces is far from
resolved.

NOT OFTEN ALONE—Life in a commune is rarely this quiet, as one member of a Palo Alto
commune finds time for a relaxed phone call. Another resident grabs this moment of solitude
for a cat nap.
