'YT)he paranoid mentality is
far more coherent than the real
world, since it leaves no room for
mistakes, failures, or
ambiguities ... it believes that it
is up against an enemy who is as
infallibly rational as he is totally
evil, and it seeks to match his
imputed total competence with its
own, leaving nothing unexpbined
and comprehending all of reality
in one overreaching, consistent
theory."
—Richard Hofstadter
Everyone loves a conspiracy.
And judging from the number of
witch-hunts which dot our
history, Americans are even more
attached to them than other
people. What's more, the
conspiratorial outlook has steadily
grown in popularity in recent
years.
Probably the greatest
attraction of the super-plot
syndrome is that fact that it can
be used to explain so many things.
If one's personal life is not all that
one would like, why, what better
explanation could there be than
interference by the most heinous
force the world has ever known?
If the destined progress of man
is not being realized, if society
does not measure up to one's
expectations, or if one's
government is following unwise
policies—how better could all of
these and any other shortcomings
be quickly and neatly explained?
An omnipotent and black-hearted
force is, by definition, capable of
whatever might go wrong.
While the conspiratorial
outlook is nothing new, it has
undergone an evolution over the
last hundred years. The plots
which we concoct today are
somehow more sinister than they

have been before; for no matter
whose fantasies you examine, the
devil's advocate is closer to
victory today than he was in the
last century.
The Greatest Threat
For at that time, the greatest
threat to all that was good and
pure came from aliens, who
imperiled our future for no other
reason than their alienness. In the
185 0 's, "native" Americans
swelled the ranks of the
Know-Nothing Party, whose main
concern was that immigrants
might out-breed, out-vote, and
overwhelm the pure Anglo stock.
The effort was to keep the
foreigners out.
"Anti-foreigner" remained the
central focus of hysteria through
the 1920'5. They were blamed, off
and on, for just about every social
ill, and sentiment came to a head
in a number of different incidents.
These were times when people felt
especially threatened, either
physically or psychologically;
they responded by creating a
scapegoat.
The Haymarket Massacre of
188 6 saw eight anarchists arrested
and sentenced, though they were
never linked to the bomb which
had killed several people. When
Governor Altgeld of Illinois
pardoned them six years later, he
ended his own political career; the
people were not yet satisfied that
the conspiracy had been avenged.
The "hyphenated Americans"
of WWI represent another
example of people being blamed
for nothing they have done.
Americans with ancestors or
relatives in the Central Powers
were eyed with suspicion lest they
be spies for the enemies of

American culture. Much as the
Nisei were rounded up in the '40's
as elements of the "Yellow Peril,"
German- and Austrian-Americans
were branded as part of a
world-wide plot following
hereditary lines.
The Red Alert of 1919, led by
the "fighting Quaker," A. Mitchell
Palmer, sought to stave off the
Bolshevik i threat which had
appeared overnight in 1917. And
the execution of Sacco and
Vanzetti in 1927 culminated
another great foreigner's
conspiracy. The men executed for
murder, just happened to be
unnaturalized Italians, atheists,
and anarchists.
In recent years, our
conspiratorial concoctions have
taken a more ambitious and
extraordinary turn. Where the
threat has always come from
without, we now find it
emanating from within. Where
9ome might earlier have built a
wall to keep the cultural polluters
out, we are now threatened by
conspiring agents who are in,
around, and amongst us. We are
truly surrounded, according to
both the extreme right and the
extreme left.
McCarthy and Birchers
On the right, we have seen Joe
McCarthy and the John Birch
Society, certain that our
government is controlled by
Communists. Listening to them,
we have already been taken over;
our role must be one not of
prevention, but of rooting out.
The fate of Goodness and Truth
now rests in the hands of a small
minority of activists, fighting to
restore the old values.
And on the left, there is no
question but that American
society is wholly corrupt and a
threat to mankind. More extreme
than the Birchers, radicals deny
that there is even a chance for
rooting out the evil. Total
destruction and rebuilding is the
only solution.
For the great conspiracy,
known to them as capitalism, has
grown too powerful and deeply
entrenched. The Military-Indust
rial Complex has taken on all the
splendid horror that the foreigner
had for the Know-Nothing, that
the Kaiser had for Teddy
Roosevelt. The one important
difference is the position of the
conspiring agent; he is no longer
an alien, readily distinguishable.
Rather, he looks just like
everyone else. And he is
everywhere.
