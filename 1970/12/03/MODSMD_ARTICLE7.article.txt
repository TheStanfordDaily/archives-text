Editor, THE DAILY:
In his ex cathedra bull to the
Stanford community, President
Lyman has announced a decision
which will ensnare student
voluntary associations in
procedural traps and leave them
open to discretionary
enforcement of a rule whose only
rationale is the harassment of
voluntary student groups.
Lyman's new edict of "open
meetings"—in view of the
University's record in this area—is
arbitrary. One of us was fined by
the University and subsequently
thrown out of school for refusing
to pay for attempting to enter a
meeting of Stanford's board of
trustees in January 1969. In April
1 9 70 , he attempted to attend a
meeting of Stanford's academic
council. For this action he was
found in contempt of court and
for this count spent 5 days in jail
and paid a fine of $100.
The edict, according to its
introduction, is in response to the
removal of John Schwartz, the
University prosecutor, from a
meeting of campus radicals in the
Roble dining hall. Schwartz had
been attending radical meetings
this quarter in the hope of
provoking some such incident. At
radical meetings, which Schwartz
did not begin to attend until he
got his current job, he constitutes
a disruption, just as President
Lyman would if he arrived drunk
at some trustees' meeting.
New Left Project activists are
radical opponents of the
American system (a system of
which the University is a part).
The NLP, like other radical
groups, is interested in discussing
its ideas with people on the
campus, and has been holding
meetings in dormatories precisely
to make this possible. Much of
our time is spent in discussing our
ideas or programs with people
who disagree—like the six
engineers who attended our last

meeting. We don't think Schwartz
attends our meetings because he
has anything to say. In fact, we
usually ask him why he comes,
and if he has anything to say. His
normal response is: "The meeting
is open, isn't it?"
Because we are an
anti-authoritarian political
tendency and not a formal
organization with elaborate
membership criteria, Lyman's

pronouncement on "members and
specially invited guests" mostly
reflects his experience with
getting his friends together to run
the University and similar
institutions. We don't organize
ourselves into anything Lyman
would recognize as "members"
and "guests," nor do we intend
to.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In his ex cathedra bull to the
Stanford community, President
Lyman has announced a decision
which will ensnare student
voluntary associations in
procedural traps and leave them
open to discretionary
enforcement of a rule whose only
rationale is the harassment of
voluntary student groups.
Lyman's new edict of "open
meetings"—in view of the
University's record in this area—is
arbitrary. One of us was fined by
the University and subsequently
thrown out of school for refusing
to pay for attempting to enter a
meeting of Stanford's board of
trustees in January 1969. In April
1 9 70 , he attempted to attend a
meeting of Stanford's academic
council. For this action he was
found in contempt of court and
for this count spent 5 days in jail
and paid a fine of $100.
The edict, according to its
introduction, is in response to the
removal of John Schwartz, the
University prosecutor, from a
meeting of campus radicals in the
Roble dining hall. Schwartz had
been attending radical meetings
this quarter in the hope of
provoking some such incident. At
radical meetings, which Schwartz
did not begin to attend until he
got his current job, he constitutes
a disruption, just as President
Lyman would if he arrived drunk
at some trustees' meeting.
New Left Project activists are
radical opponents of the
American system (a system of
which the University is a part).
The NLP, like other radical
groups, is interested in discussing
its ideas with people on the
campus, and has been holding
meetings in dormatories precisely
to make this possible. Much of
our time is spent in discussing our
ideas or programs with people
who disagree—like the six
engineers who attended our last

meeting. We don't think Schwartz
attends our meetings because he
has anything to say. In fact, we
usually ask him why he comes,
and if he has anything to say. His
normal response is: "The meeting
is open, isn't it?"
Because we are an
anti-authoritarian political
tendency and not a formal
organization with elaborate
membership criteria, Lyman's

pronouncement on "members and
specially invited guests" mostly
reflects his experience with
getting his friends together to run
the University and similar
institutions. We don't organize
ourselves into anything Lyman
would recognize as "members"
and "guests," nor do we intend
to.
