University Relations Office.)
TO THE STANFORD COMMUNITY:
Last Tuesday night Professor John Schwartz was ejected
from an "open" meeting of the New Left Project in the Roble
dining hall. The meeting had been announced in Tuesday's
Daily as an "open" meeting—"everyone invited"—and the
space had been expressly reserved for an open meeting. This is
not the first time that exclusion of this kind has occurred. I
am aware of at least one recent instance in which several
students were ejected from an announced open meeting at
Tresidder Union.
In an effort to prevent such occurrences in the future I wish
to make clear the University's policy on the use of University
facilities by voluntary student organizations and the
consequences that attach to violations of the policy.
Henceforth any voluntary student organization seeking to use
University space must inform the person responsible for
allocating that space whether the meeting is to be open, i.e., all
who wish may attend, or closed, i.e., attendance limited to
members and specifically invited guests. Open meetings will be
given preference in the case of competing needs.
If a meeting is to be closed that fact must be mentioned in
any announcement of the meeting, including handbills,
advertisements or other means. Any meeting not specifically
declared to be closed both in the application for a meeting
place and in announcements is an open meeting, and all who
wish may attend.
A voluntary student organization which does not adhere to
this policy will be denied the use of University meeting space
for the remainder of the academic year. In addition, any
individual participating in the act of excluding any person
from an open meeting will be appropriately charged before the
SJC.
