# Self-Esteem Plays Part In Shockley's Research
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Professor William Shockley is quite candid about
why he pursues the topic of worsening heredity
among black people. "It's what I will think of
myself... It's very self-oriented."
The decline of genetic potential among all races,
"might well be the most important single factor in
the future of the nation, maybe even the future of
the world. No one else of equal eminence is tackling
this one."
He feels pride is not unnatural when one
undertakes a difficult project. "In the end you will
be very concerned with your self-esteem and this
seems to be the nature of man or thinking man."
This is one of the conclusions that Shockley the
philosopher draws from his three humanistic
postulates. The first postulate is that a humane
civilization depends on "man's concern for the
emotions experienced by his fellow creatures." The
second is that "The truth shall make you free."
He states the third, "Terminal Self-Esteem," as
follows: "During the last rational five minutes of
my life, I hope to consider that since 1967 I have
used my capacities close to their maximum
potential, in keeping with the objectives of Nobel's
Will, of conferring the greatest benefit on
mankind."
"I regard my presence here today as a theorem
from these postulates," said Shockley a year ago, in
a speech on human quality problems.
Wears Two Hats
This is not to imply that the physicist has been
completely converted to an educator and geneticist.
"He's always worn two hats," says one of his
colleagues in the Electrical Engineering department.
At the Bell Telephone Laboratories Shockley
found one hat fit particularly well in 1939 when he
came up with the idea of a semi-conductor device
that would amplify current, replacing the
cumbersome vacuum tube.
He credits himself with clearing the theoretical
pathway for the invention of what is now known as
the transistor and adds that it might have had to
wait five years without his help.
Finally, in December 1947, his two colleagues
John Bardeen and Walter Brattain put together a
prototype of the transistor. In 195 6 the three men
were jointly awarded the Nobel prize.
Physics Research Limited
Nevertheless, the physics research he does is
much diminished. He does not regret it, however. "I
have the notion that all thinking is very much alike.
I see little difference in writing a good letter to the
editor and doing mathematics."
The other hat he wore while developing the
transistor was his interest in a scientist's rational
thinking process. As director of the solid state
physics program at Bell he attempted to judge what
determined the great range of research productivity
he saw among his colleagues.
Later, when he came to Stanford in 1963, he
helped science teachers in the area develop what he
calls a "creative failure methodology."
He thinks this method "might overcome almost
one-third" of what he calls "the Negro scholastic
deficit."
"He's really helped my PhD students over a
certain mental block," says Professor William
Spicer, "They are afraid to be wrong. He's shown
them the mistakes he's made. He's shown how you
have to be wrong before you find the right thing."
Shockley gives a freshman seminar whose
principal thesis is that "thinking about thinking
improves thinking." He feels that throughout
Stanford "One of the serious problems in the
teaching situation is that students very seldom learn

anything thoroughly so they really know it.
Furthermore they run into all this soft-headed
argumentative semantic stuff that there are no
truths and it's all a matter of definition."
Finding Truth
For Shockley, finding what may be the truth
appears to be a simpler job than for most people. He
completed eight grades of grammar school in four
years, graduating from the Palo Alto Military
Academy in 1922, at the age of twelve.
"His analytic abilities are terrifying," says a
colleague who admires his talent for finding "the
hidden assumptions."
"His whole thrust is for rational criteria," says
Spicer, who has known him for several years. "His
whole conflict comes from people who use
arguments he feels don't have a rational basis."
When dealing with social questions, "He has more
faith than I do that you cain isolate all the
variables."
A student who worked for Shockley last summer
concurs: "The simplicity of his models is very nice
to use." But he is unsure "whether you can really
compute human intelligence with one or two
variables. . . His (Shoekley's) limitation to the direct
and physical sciences is his greatest danger."
Other men, such as Joshua Lederberg, feel that
Shoekley's advent into the fields of sociology and
genetics has been something less than professional.
Lederberg calls Shoekley's recent pronouncements
"an abuse of his privilege as a scientist."
On other matters Shockley places a great deal of
importance on the role that the overall intelligence
of a population plays in determining its social
structure.
Levels of Intelligence
"May it not be that some nations have levels, or
some groups of people have levels of intelligence in
which the appropriate form of government is a
dictatorship? That the contribution of thinking
people that can size up issues and vote on them
wisely may be small enough so that they will
actually lead better lives on the whole if you have
more control exerted? This is not my area of
expertise," he adds.
As to eugenics, Shockley has proposed "thinking
exercises." In general, he finds it unwise to discuss
specific programs far in the future, expecially in
reference to black people. The problem is not "to
raise IQ but to prevent it from dropping."
"I think most people would believe and favor
having movement in a direction in which the next
generation would be more capable of enjoying these
higher level sort of intellectual things than this
generation. So on that basis I would say this applies
across the board to all humanity."
Speculative Thinking
At the end of several of Shoekley's writings is a
quote from Kingsley Davis, a sociologist at
Berkeley. "When man has conquered his own
biological evolution, he will have laid the basis for
conquering everything else. The universe will be his,
at last."
Shockley denies any science fiction or futuristic
interpretations can be made from this quote. "In
this area of speculative thinking I set a time limit of
about 30 years. To try and think beyond that is not
particularly useful or constructive.
"If one has contributed towards that then one
can pass the burden on to the next generation with
a relatively clear conscience, you see, and hope for a
reasonably comfortable last rational five minutes."
As to the long hours he spent being interviewed,
he said, "If I can produce any education, any more
thought, why this is a useful thing. This is the way I
spend time."

across the board to all humanity."
Speculative Thinking
At the end of several of Shoekley's writings is a
quote from Kingsley Davis, a sociologist at
Berkeley. "When man has conquered his own
biological evolution, he will have laid the basis for
conquering everything else. The universe will be his,
at last."
Shockley denies any science fiction or futuristic
interpretations can be made from this quote. "In
this area of speculative thinking I set a time limit of
about 30 years. To try and think beyond that is not
particularly useful or constructive.
"If one has contributed towards that then one
can pass the burden on to the next generation with
a relatively clear conscience, you see, and hope for a
reasonably comfortable last rational five minutes."
As to the long hours he spent being interviewed,
he said, "If I can produce any education, any more
thought, why this is a useful thing. This is the way I
spend time."
Professor William Shockley is quite candid about
why he pursues the topic of worsening heredity
among black people. "It's what I will think of
myself... It's very self-oriented."
The decline of genetic potential among all races,
"might well be the most important single factor in
the future of the nation, maybe even the future of
the world. No one else of equal eminence is tackling
this one."
He feels pride is not unnatural when one
undertakes a difficult project. "In the end you will
be very concerned with your self-esteem and this
seems to be the nature of man or thinking man."
This is one of the conclusions that Shockley the
philosopher draws from his three humanistic
postulates. The first postulate is that a humane
civilization depends on "man's concern for the
emotions experienced by his fellow creatures." The
second is that "The truth shall make you free."
He states the third, "Terminal Self-Esteem," as
follows: "During the last rational five minutes of
my life, I hope to consider that since 1967 I have
used my capacities close to their maximum
potential, in keeping with the objectives of Nobel's
Will, of conferring the greatest benefit on
mankind."
"I regard my presence here today as a theorem
from these postulates," said Shockley a year ago, in
a speech on human quality problems.
Wears Two Hats
This is not to imply that the physicist has been
completely converted to an educator and geneticist.
"He's always worn two hats," says one of his
colleagues in the Electrical Engineering department.
At the Bell Telephone Laboratories Shockley
found one hat fit particularly well in 1939 when he
came up with the idea of a semi-conductor device
that would amplify current, replacing the
cumbersome vacuum tube.
He credits himself with clearing the theoretical
pathway for the invention of what is now known as
the transistor and adds that it might have had to
wait five years without his help.
Finally, in December 1947, his two colleagues
John Bardeen and Walter Brattain put together a
prototype of the transistor. In 195 6 the three men
were jointly awarded the Nobel prize.
Physics Research Limited
Nevertheless, the physics research he does is
much diminished. He does not regret it, however. "I
have the notion that all thinking is very much alike.
I see little difference in writing a good letter to the
editor and doing mathematics."
The other hat he wore while developing the
transistor was his interest in a scientist's rational
thinking process. As director of the solid state
physics program at Bell he attempted to judge what
determined the great range of research productivity
he saw among his colleagues.
Later, when he came to Stanford in 1963, he
helped science teachers in the area develop what he
calls a "creative failure methodology."
He thinks this method "might overcome almost
one-third" of what he calls "the Negro scholastic
deficit."
"He's really helped my PhD students over a
certain mental block," says Professor William
Spicer, "They are afraid to be wrong. He's shown
them the mistakes he's made. He's shown how you
have to be wrong before you find the right thing."
Shockley gives a freshman seminar whose
principal thesis is that "thinking about thinking
improves thinking." He feels that throughout
Stanford "One of the serious problems in the
teaching situation is that students very seldom learn

anything thoroughly so they really know it.
Furthermore they run into all this soft-headed
argumentative semantic stuff that there are no
truths and it's all a matter of definition."
Finding Truth
For Shockley, finding what may be the truth
appears to be a simpler job than for most people. He
completed eight grades of grammar school in four
years, graduating from the Palo Alto Military
Academy in 1922, at the age of twelve.
"His analytic abilities are terrifying," says a
colleague who admires his talent for finding "the
hidden assumptions."
"His whole thrust is for rational criteria," says
Spicer, who has known him for several years. "His
whole conflict comes from people who use
arguments he feels don't have a rational basis."
When dealing with social questions, "He has more
faith than I do that you cain isolate all the
variables."
A student who worked for Shockley last summer
concurs: "The simplicity of his models is very nice
to use." But he is unsure "whether you can really
compute human intelligence with one or two
variables. . . His (Shoekley's) limitation to the direct
and physical sciences is his greatest danger."
Other men, such as Joshua Lederberg, feel that
Shoekley's advent into the fields of sociology and
genetics has been something less than professional.
Lederberg calls Shoekley's recent pronouncements
"an abuse of his privilege as a scientist."
On other matters Shockley places a great deal of
importance on the role that the overall intelligence
of a population plays in determining its social
structure.
Levels of Intelligence
"May it not be that some nations have levels, or
some groups of people have levels of intelligence in
which the appropriate form of government is a
dictatorship? That the contribution of thinking
people that can size up issues and vote on them
wisely may be small enough so that they will
actually lead better lives on the whole if you have
more control exerted? This is not my area of
expertise," he adds.
As to eugenics, Shockley has proposed "thinking
exercises." In general, he finds it unwise to discuss
specific programs far in the future, expecially in
reference to black people. The problem is not "to
raise IQ but to prevent it from dropping."
"I think most people would believe and favor
having movement in a direction in which the next
generation would be more capable of enjoying these
higher level sort of intellectual things than this
generation. So on that basis I would say this applies
across the board to all humanity."

structure.
Levels of Intelligence
"May it not be that some nations have levels, or
some groups of people have levels of intelligence in
which the appropriate form of government is a
dictatorship? That the contribution of thinking
people that can size up issues and vote on them
wisely may be small enough so that they will
actually lead better lives on the whole if you have
more control exerted? This is not my area of
expertise," he adds.
As to eugenics, Shockley has proposed "thinking
exercises." In general, he finds it unwise to discuss
specific programs far in the future, expecially in
reference to black people. The problem is not "to
raise IQ but to prevent it from dropping."
"I think most people would believe and favor
having movement in a direction in which the next
generation would be more capable of enjoying these
higher level sort of intellectual things than this
generation. So on that basis I would say this applies
across the board to all humanity."
Speculative Thinking
At the end of several of Shoekley's writings is a
quote from Kingsley Davis, a sociologist at
Berkeley. "When man has conquered his own
biological evolution, he will have laid the basis for
conquering everything else. The universe will be his,
at last."
Shockley denies any science fiction or futuristic
interpretations can be made from this quote. "In
this area of speculative thinking I set a time limit of
about 30 years. To try and think beyond that is not
particularly useful or constructive.
"If one has contributed towards that then one
can pass the burden on to the next generation with
a relatively clear conscience, you see, and hope for a
reasonably comfortable last rational five minutes."
As to the long hours he spent being interviewed,
he said, "If I can produce any education, any more
thought, why this is a useful thing. This is the way I
spend time."
Professor William Shockley is quite candid about
why he pursues the topic of worsening heredity
among black people. "It's what I will think of
myself... It's very self-oriented."
The decline of genetic potential among all races,
"might well be the most important single factor in
the future of the nation, maybe even the future of
the world. No one else of equal eminence is tackling
this one."
He feels pride is not unnatural when one
undertakes a difficult project. "In the end you will
be very concerned with your self-esteem and this
seems to be the nature of man or thinking man."
This is one of the conclusions that Shockley the
philosopher draws from his three humanistic
postulates. The first postulate is that a humane
civilization depends on "man's concern for the
emotions experienced by his fellow creatures." The
second is that "The truth shall make you free."
He states the third, "Terminal Self-Esteem," as
follows: "During the last rational five minutes of
my life, I hope to consider that since 1967 I have
used my capacities close to their maximum
potential, in keeping with the objectives of Nobel's
Will, of conferring the greatest benefit on
mankind."
"I regard my presence here today as a theorem
from these postulates," said Shockley a year ago, in
a speech on human quality problems.
Wears Two Hats
This is not to imply that the physicist has been
completely converted to an educator and geneticist.
"He's always worn two hats," says one of his
colleagues in the Electrical Engineering department.
At the Bell Telephone Laboratories Shockley
found one hat fit particularly well in 1939 when he
came up with the idea of a semi-conductor device
that would amplify current, replacing the
cumbersome vacuum tube.
He credits himself with clearing the theoretical
pathway for the invention of what is now known as
the transistor and adds that it might have had to
wait five years without his help.
Finally, in December 1947, his two colleagues
John Bardeen and Walter Brattain put together a
prototype of the transistor. In 195 6 the three men
were jointly awarded the Nobel prize.
Physics Research Limited
Nevertheless, the physics research he does is
much diminished. He does not regret it, however. "I
have the notion that all thinking is very much alike.
I see little difference in writing a good letter to the
editor and doing mathematics."
The other hat he wore while developing the
transistor was his interest in a scientist's rational
thinking process. As director of the solid state
physics program at Bell he attempted to judge what
determined the great range of research productivity
he saw among his colleagues.
Later, when he came to Stanford in 1963, he
helped science teachers in the area develop what he
calls a "creative failure methodology."
He thinks this method "might overcome almost
one-third" of what he calls "the Negro scholastic
deficit."
"He's really helped my PhD students over a
certain mental block," says Professor William
Spicer, "They are afraid to be wrong. He's shown
them the mistakes he's made. He's shown how you
have to be wrong before you find the right thing."
Shockley gives a freshman seminar whose
principal thesis is that "thinking about thinking
improves thinking." He feels that throughout
Stanford "One of the serious problems in the
teaching situation is that students very seldom learn

anything thoroughly so they really know it.
Furthermore they run into all this soft-headed
argumentative semantic stuff that there are no
truths and it's all a matter of definition."
Finding Truth
For Shockley, finding what may be the truth
appears to be a simpler job than for most people. He
completed eight grades of grammar school in four
years, graduating from the Palo Alto Military
Academy in 1922, at the age of twelve.
"His analytic abilities are terrifying," says a
colleague who admires his talent for finding "the
hidden assumptions."
"His whole thrust is for rational criteria," says
Spicer, who has known him for several years. "His
whole conflict comes from people who use
arguments he feels don't have a rational basis."
When dealing with social questions, "He has more
faith than I do that you cain isolate all the
variables."
A student who worked for Shockley last summer
concurs: "The simplicity of his models is very nice
to use." But he is unsure "whether you can really
compute human intelligence with one or two
variables. . . His (Shoekley's) limitation to the direct
and physical sciences is his greatest danger."
Other men, such as Joshua Lederberg, feel that
Shoekley's advent into the fields of sociology and
genetics has been something less than professional.
Lederberg calls Shoekley's recent pronouncements
"an abuse of his privilege as a scientist."
On other matters Shockley places a great deal of
importance on the role that the overall intelligence
of a population plays in determining its social
structure.
