Today In The i Daily'
Today's issue is the last of the year, allowing all good staffers to
rest and study.
Announcements for the first issue of next quarter should be
in the proper envelope at the Daily office by 1:30 p.m. January
3, 1971. That, however, is not a surefire promise that the gods
of the press will insure their publication.
Beat Ohio State.
