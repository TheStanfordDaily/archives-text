HEAR GORDON VERPLANK
He left something of himself with us after the year he
gave us in 1966-67 as Assistant Dean of the Chapel,
and this Church and the whole Chapel program are
better for it. Chaplain Verplank, only a few years out
of seminary, is one of the leading college and univer-
sity chaplains of the country. He went from Stanford
to Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Oregon; and
a few months ago, he moved to take the position of
Chaplain of the Associate Colleges of Claremont, Cali
fornia.
