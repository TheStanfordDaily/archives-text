# Officialdom Censors Band; Bowl Costs Worry School

### DON TOLLEFSON 
For their first Rose Bowl appearance
in 19 years the Stanford band had
made some magnificent plans. They
naturally included their cannon, their
renowned version of the Star-Spangled
Banner, and another of their typically
"relevant" halftime shows. They had
also thought of another new twist,
riding in golf carts for the Rose Parade.
Unfortunately the Rose Bowl isn't
"home, sweet, home" and what you
can do here is a bit more than what you
can do in the "grandaddy of all bowl
games." Most of the plans were subject
to the approval of people who in the
past haven't been too excited about the
Band and who apparently still aren't.
The Tournament of Roses
committee immediately said no to the
golf cart idea. Executive manager Max
Colwell said in a letter to the band,
"The executive board of the
Tournament of Roses feels that the use
of golf carts would be contrary to our
policy and therefore we must withhold
permission to use them.
"We appreciate the unique qualities
of the very excellent Stanford band and
its desire to be different... (But) the
Tournament of Roses now in its 82nd
year is more or less traditional. We
would ask that your band participate as
a traditional marching band."
The band will march in the parade.
But one band member said, "I hardly
think that the band can remain in rank
and file marching formation for 2-1/2
hours and seven miles."
If They Survive
Assuming that they survive the
parade, or more likely the night before,
the band will then proceed to the Rose
Bowl. But they will probably enter it
minus both the cannon and their usual
version of the national anthem.
In another letter dated December 1,
Colwell told the band that any decision
on the cannon would have to be made
by the game managers, UCLA business
manager and Tournament Football
Committee member, Don Ashen, and
Stanford Athletic Director Chuck
Taylor.
According to Taylor, the cannon

will not be allowed, primarily for safety
reasons. After two persons were injured
by the cannon in the Washington game,
the Santa Clara County fire marshall
ruled that it could not be fired again.
Members of the band claim that the
fire marshall convinced the Rose Bowl
people that it would be unsafe. But
conference publicity director
Bob Sprenger claims that there is a
long-standing Rose Bowl rule
prohibiting explosions of any kind.
Cannon Law
Sprenger says the rule has been in
effect ever since some people got
injured in a similar type of accident 10
or 11 years ago. He pointed out that
part of the reason for the rule is that
there is no track and the stands at the
Rose Bowl are very low.
The band also will probably be
unable to play their version of the
anthem, but Peterson has not given up
yet. Taylor says that the reason why
the Rose Bowl people prefer a full band
version is that "it is more conducive to
singing."
Peterson agrees that this is the
reason the Tournament people gave
him at a meeting last weekend. But he
adds, "They made the decision without
ever hearing our version, so I left them
a record of it. I intend to talk to some
Stanford alumni on the Tournament
committee and also present a formal
written request asking that our version
be allowed."
A final point of conflict may still
come over the Stanford halftime show.

The plans for the show must be
submitted to Taylor by December 21
and he must approve them before
passing them on to NBC and the
Tournament for their approval.
No Racy Show
Citing the theme of the Rose Bowl
this year, "Through the Eyes of a
Child," Taylor said that the show must
be "a pretty straight operation and it
can't be risque."
When questioned about show plans,
Peterson said, "It will be a topic theme
that everybody can relate to and will
include our strongest music from this
quarter."
Peterson also said that the plans
which are approved will be carried out
by the band without alterations. He
said that more than once during their
Washington halftime show, ABC
switched from full field shots to
