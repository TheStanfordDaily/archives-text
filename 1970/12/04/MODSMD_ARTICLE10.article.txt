# New Program Designed To Aid Students Flunking Out

"Most academic problems faced by students
are not ones of basic ability, but are usually
related to personal problems and a lack of
capacity to cope," according to Associate Dean
of Undergraduate Studies Douglas Davis.
Education here is molded around the
concept of the "self-supporting, self-selecting
student," but even "if you accept the notion
that a student is usually capable of
self-direction," Davis added, "you must realize
that there are exceptions." And it is these
exceptions who find themselves in peril of
disproving the old adage that "you can't flunk
out of Stanford."
Although less than one-half of one percent
of all students do actually flunk out of
Stanford, there is a much higher percentage
placed on academic probation each year. The
problem, according to Davis, is not one of just
"throwing people out, but one of how to aid
those students who are having problems: how
to identify them and get them to seek help. The
self-support student theory is only viable if
students have access to adequate information
and guidance which they want and need."
Cowell Health Center psychiatric service, the
Dean of Students office, and the new Academic
Information Center are just a few of the
"support systems" presently available. But
perhaps the most important innovation is the
"academic flagging system" approved last week
by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
This new system is an attempt to resolve the
old problem of how to get a student to seek
help before it is too late.
Under the old system, negative points were
given for each unit of "D" received. An
accumulation of seven to sixteen negative
points in one academic year led to probation.

Seventeen or more points were cause for
suspension.
The "flagging system" is designed to reach
the student when he really needs help, and not
after his problems have been compounded to
the point of no return. Under this system, "a
student who fails to complete, (i.e. receive a
grade of "C" or above in), at least 36 units of
work in his or her most recent three quarters of
enrollment at the University, or a student who
fails to complete at least nine quarter units in
his or her most recent quarter of enrollment
shall be placed on probation (a warning
status)."
What this means is that in the span of one
quarter, the Dean of Students office will be
aware that a student is having problems, and
then the student will receive an "invitation" to
seek help from one of the University's advising
services. If the student refuses to "come in and
talk," he can be suspended.
According to Associate Dean of Students
Harold Boyd, the Dean's office is "not here to
act as a crutch, but to provide direction to help
the student reappraise himself and the
situation." Most students who come for help
"have no sense of direction and see no relation
between what they are taking and the demands
of society." Many students are at Stanford
"because it is the thing to do." Parental and
societal pressures dictate that he go to college
even though "the student may have no definite
views on what college can do for him."
In many of these cases, Dean Davis feels that
the use of suspension for one year is another
valuable "help technique".
"Stanford," he said, "is not a very good
place for a student to learn how to cope. The
suspension system is saying just that â€” it's time
to leave for a year and think long and hard on
whether Stanford is the place for you."
