# Symphony's Opening
## 
### PEDRO RAMET 
The San Francisco Symphony
opened its season Wednesday
night under the direction of its
principal conductor, Seiji Ozawa.
Being the first night of Ozawa's
"reign," the audience, composed
largely of students from the Bay
Area, was especially receptive and
extravagantly appreciative.
Much to my surprise, it seems
that the Haydn "Te Deum," with
♦ which the concert began, is but
the first installment in a Haydn
series which Ozawa plans for the
next three years (the term of his
contract in San Francisco). This is
a most welcome departure from
recent trends that tend to stress at
turns either obscure Romantics,
avant-garde compositions or
standard standards. One of the
things that the concert hall can
accomplish is the exposure of
lesser known works by reputable
composers. Haydn is generally
accepted as a versatile composer,
but we so rarely listen to anything
of his besides his symphonies and
his string quartets.
The "Te Deum," which dates
from 1 799, near the close of
Haydn's life, was composed in the
finest Bruckner tradition, i.e.,
there is no thought of
spectacle—Haydn's mind was
concentrated exclusively on
singing the praises of God. It is
the finished work of a mature
mind, but it is not exciting, as
some Haydn is (e.g. symphony no.
82). It isn't meant to be.
Incidentally, those who have
been hoping to purchase
recordings of all the Haydn
symphonies will be pleased to
know that Decca/London has
undertaken to record all 104 of
them with the London Symphony
Orchestra and Antal Dorati.
The Stanford University

Chorus and Choir, directed by
Professor Harold Schmidt, assisted
in the Haydn "Te Deum" and in
the Bernstein "Chichester Psalms"
which followed. They were in
good form; and the alto soloist
from the San Francisco Boys'
Chorus did an admirable job with
a quite tricky part.
More Than Tricky
The "Chichester Psalms"
(1 965), in fact, is more than
merely tricky; it is difficult to the
point of defiance. For example,
the very first measure is in 6/4
time, but the third measure is in
3/4 time. The fourth measure is in
3/8 time, the fifth in 5/4, the
sixth in 2/4, the seventh in 5/8,
the ninth in 6/4, and so on. He
makes use of 7/4, 9/4 and 10/4,
varies the metronome values
continually; the entire piece,
though identifiably tonal, and
beautiful at that, is suggestive of
tongue-in-cheek chromaticism.
That the performance was a
resounding success speaks well of
both orchestra and chorus, not to
mention their respective directors.
I would make only one criticism
thus far: not only were there
times when it was more than
apparent than Ozawa was an
interested in dramatic acrobatics
as in leading the orchestra, but
several times, he was not even
keeping the beat. And in a work
like the Bernstein "Psalms,"
rather than forgetting altogether
about beat, as one's first
inclination might be, it is crucial
to be all the more obvious in
punctuating the rhythmn.
I had expected the Berlioz'
"Symphonie Phntastique" to be
Ozawa's strong point. It is a work
with which he has long been
familiar. But led on by an excess
of extra-musical enthusiasm, he
raced through the work at a
surprisingly fast clip. To give just
one example of this, the fourth
movement, subtitled "March to
the Gallows," has a metronome
marking of half note equals 72;
Maestro Ozawa's rendition

galloped by at almost 96, thus
sacrificing any hope of evoking
the grotesque funeral.
Furthermore, by taking the tempo
so much faster than the score
indicates, the trumpets were
unable to keep up.
'Sound and Fury'
Ozawa was strongest in the
third movement of the symphony,
weakest in the last. In the waltz
(no. 2), the pulse was steady and
without ritard. In the fifth
movement, I couldn't help
thinking 'much sound and fury
signifying nothing.' Loud
percussion and speed have always
had a certain sensual appeal. But
so do innumerable other things
that have nothing to do with how
this symphony should sound.
For instance, does the
Beethoven Eroiea symphony
sound any better if the
management of the Opera House
rains $100 bills upon the audience
during the playing of the scherzo
movement? Percussion, like many
other things, is useful and
pleasurable. But there are times
when an excessive indulgence in
percussion becomes irrelevant,
distracting, and destructive. There
is more to music than spectacle.
Seiji Ozawa has a recognized
talent, which he has demonstrated
in the past and which he
demonstrated again in both the
Haydn and the Bernstein works.
But it is hoped that Maestro
Ozawa will steer clear of the
pop -classics approach to music.
This approach was useful sixty
years ago, when Walter Damrosch
took music to people all over the
United States and wanted to
establish an immediate rapport
with many a culturally unexposed
region. But it is no longer
necessary to do this.

3/8 time, the fifth in 5/4, the
sixth in 2/4, the seventh in 5/8,
the ninth in 6/4, and so on. He
makes use of 7/4, 9/4 and 10/4,
varies the metronome values
continually; the entire piece,
though identifiably tonal, and
beautiful at that, is suggestive of
tongue-in-cheek chromaticism.
That the performance was a
resounding success speaks well of
both orchestra and chorus, not to
mention their respective directors.
I would make only one criticism
thus far: not only were there
times when it was more than
apparent than Ozawa was an
interested in dramatic acrobatics
as in leading the orchestra, but
several times, he was not even
keeping the beat. And in a work
like the Bernstein "Psalms,"
rather than forgetting altogether
about beat, as one's first
inclination might be, it is crucial
to be all the more obvious in
punctuating the rhythmn.
I had expected the Berlioz'
"Symphonie Phntastique" to be
Ozawa's strong point. It is a work
with which he has long been
familiar. But led on by an excess
of extra-musical enthusiasm, he
raced through the work at a
surprisingly fast clip. To give just
one example of this, the fourth
movement, subtitled "March to
the Gallows," has a metronome
marking of half note equals 72;
Maestro Ozawa's rendition

galloped by at almost 96, thus
sacrificing any hope of evoking
the grotesque funeral.
Furthermore, by taking the tempo
so much faster than the score
indicates, the trumpets were
unable to keep up.
'Sound and Fury'
Ozawa was strongest in the
third movement of the symphony,
weakest in the last. In the waltz
(no. 2), the pulse was steady and
without ritard. In the fifth
movement, I couldn't help
thinking 'much sound and fury
signifying nothing.' Loud
percussion and speed have always
had a certain sensual appeal. But
so do innumerable other things
that have nothing to do with how
this symphony should sound.
For instance, does the
Beethoven Eroiea symphony
sound any better if the
management of the Opera House
rains $100 bills upon the audience
during the playing of the scherzo
movement? Percussion, like many
other things, is useful and
pleasurable. But there are times
when an excessive indulgence in
percussion becomes irrelevant,
distracting, and destructive. There
is more to music than spectacle.
Seiji Ozawa has a recognized
talent, which he has demonstrated
in the past and which he
demonstrated again in both the
Haydn and the Bernstein works.
But it is hoped that Maestro
Ozawa will steer clear of the
pop -classics approach to music.
This approach was useful sixty
years ago, when Walter Damrosch
took music to people all over the
United States and wanted to
establish an immediate rapport
with many a culturally unexposed
region. But it is no longer
necessary to do this.

influence of African culture in today's society, using authentic

The San Francisco Symphony
opened its season Wednesday
night under the direction of its
principal conductor, Seiji Ozawa.
Being the first night of Ozawa's
"reign," the audience, composed
largely of students from the Bay
Area, was especially receptive and
extravagantly appreciative.
Much to my surprise, it seems
that the Haydn "Te Deum," with
♦ which the concert began, is but
the first installment in a Haydn
series which Ozawa plans for the
next three years (the term of his
contract in San Francisco). This is
a most welcome departure from
recent trends that tend to stress at
turns either obscure Romantics,
avant-garde compositions or
standard standards. One of the
things that the concert hall can
accomplish is the exposure of
lesser known works by reputable
composers. Haydn is generally
accepted as a versatile composer,
but we so rarely listen to anything
of his besides his symphonies and
his string quartets.
The "Te Deum," which dates
from 1 799, near the close of
Haydn's life, was composed in the
finest Bruckner tradition, i.e.,
there is no thought of
spectacle—Haydn's mind was
concentrated exclusively on
singing the praises of God. It is
the finished work of a mature
mind, but it is not exciting, as
some Haydn is (e.g. symphony no.
82). It isn't meant to be.
Incidentally, those who have
been hoping to purchase
recordings of all the Haydn
symphonies will be pleased to
know that Decca/London has
undertaken to record all 104 of
them with the London Symphony
Orchestra and Antal Dorati.

in the Haydn "Te Deum" and in
the Bernstein "Chichester Psalms"

a quite tricky part.
More Than Tricky
The "Chichester Psalms"
(1 965), in fact, is more than
merely tricky; it is difficult to the
point of defiance. For example,
the very first measure is in 6/4

rains $100 bills upon the audience
during the playing of the scherzo
movement? Percussion, like many
other things, is useful and
pleasurable. But there are times
when an excessive indulgence in
percussion becomes irrelevant,
distracting, and destructive. There
is more to music than spectacle.
Seiji Ozawa has a recognized
talent, which he has demonstrated
in the past and which he
demonstrated again in both the
Haydn and the Bernstein works.
But it is hoped that Maestro
Ozawa will steer clear of the
pop -classics approach to music.
This approach was useful sixty
years ago, when Walter Damrosch
took music to people all over the
United States and wanted to
establish an immediate rapport
with many a culturally unexposed
region. But it is no longer
necessary to do this.

ISHANGI CONCERT—The Ishangi Dance Family will perform at 4
this afternoon in Cubberley Auditorium, sponsored by the BSU and
the Afro American Studies program. Their performance presents the
influence of African culture in today's society, using authentic
instruments and native dance forms.
The San Francisco Symphony
opened its season Wednesday
night under the direction of its
principal conductor, Seiji Ozawa.
Being the first night of Ozawa's
"reign," the audience, composed
largely of students from the Bay
Area, was especially receptive and
extravagantly appreciative.
Much to my surprise, it seems
that the Haydn "Te Deum," with
♦ which the concert began, is but
the first installment in a Haydn
series which Ozawa plans for the
next three years (the term of his
contract in San Francisco). This is
a most welcome departure from
recent trends that tend to stress at
turns either obscure Romantics,
avant-garde compositions or
standard standards. One of the
things that the concert hall can
accomplish is the exposure of
lesser known works by reputable
composers. Haydn is generally
accepted as a versatile composer,
but we so rarely listen to anything
of his besides his symphonies and
his string quartets.
The "Te Deum," which dates
from 1 799, near the close of
Haydn's life, was composed in the
finest Bruckner tradition, i.e.,
there is no thought of
spectacle—Haydn's mind was
concentrated exclusively on
singing the praises of God. It is
the finished work of a mature
mind, but it is not exciting, as
some Haydn is (e.g. symphony no.
82). It isn't meant to be.
Incidentally, those who have
been hoping to purchase
recordings of all the Haydn
symphonies will be pleased to
know that Decca/London has
undertaken to record all 104 of
them with the London Symphony
Orchestra and Antal Dorati.
The Stanford University

Chorus and Choir, directed by
Professor Harold Schmidt, assisted
in the Haydn "Te Deum" and in
the Bernstein "Chichester Psalms"
which followed. They were in
good form; and the alto soloist
from the San Francisco Boys'
Chorus did an admirable job with
a quite tricky part.
More Than Tricky
The "Chichester Psalms"
(1 965), in fact, is more than
merely tricky; it is difficult to the
point of defiance. For example,
the very first measure is in 6/4
time, but the third measure is in
3/4 time. The fourth measure is in
3/8 time, the fifth in 5/4, the
sixth in 2/4, the seventh in 5/8,
the ninth in 6/4, and so on. He
makes use of 7/4, 9/4 and 10/4,
varies the metronome values
continually; the entire piece,
though identifiably tonal, and
beautiful at that, is suggestive of
tongue-in-cheek chromaticism.
That the performance was a
resounding success speaks well of
both orchestra and chorus, not to
mention their respective directors.
I would make only one criticism
thus far: not only were there
times when it was more than
apparent than Ozawa was an
interested in dramatic acrobatics
as in leading the orchestra, but
several times, he was not even
keeping the beat. And in a work
like the Bernstein "Psalms,"
rather than forgetting altogether
about beat, as one's first
inclination might be, it is crucial
to be all the more obvious in
punctuating the rhythmn.
I had expected the Berlioz'
"Symphonie Phntastique" to be
Ozawa's strong point. It is a work
with which he has long been
familiar. But led on by an excess
of extra-musical enthusiasm, he
raced through the work at a
surprisingly fast clip. To give just
one example of this, the fourth
movement, subtitled "March to
the Gallows," has a metronome
marking of half note equals 72;
Maestro Ozawa's rendition

galloped by at almost 96, thus
sacrificing any hope of evoking
the grotesque funeral.
Furthermore, by taking the tempo
so much faster than the score
indicates, the trumpets were
unable to keep up.
'Sound and Fury'
Ozawa was strongest in the
third movement of the symphony,
weakest in the last. In the waltz
(no. 2), the pulse was steady and
without ritard. In the fifth
movement, I couldn't help
thinking 'much sound and fury
signifying nothing.' Loud
percussion and speed have always
had a certain sensual appeal. But
so do innumerable other things
that have nothing to do with how
this symphony should sound.
For instance, does the
Beethoven Eroiea symphony
sound any better if the
management of the Opera House
rains $100 bills upon the audience
during the playing of the scherzo
movement? Percussion, like many
other things, is useful and
pleasurable. But there are times
when an excessive indulgence in
percussion becomes irrelevant,
distracting, and destructive. There
is more to music than spectacle.
