# Free Fellini Film Tonight
## 
### 
A fascinating and revealing film about Federieo Fellini, "Ciao
Federieo," will be shown this evening at 8 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, followed by a discussion session with its creator and
director Gideon Bachmann. Bachmann and his crew followed
Fellini on the set of "Satyricon" in an attempt to capture on film
the real world of the creative genius who believes that "reality
does not exist. The artist invents it."
The critical portrait of Fellini reveals the film maker, not as he
sees himself, but rather as he relates to the reality he creates.
"Ciao Federieo" had its premiere at the Venice Film Festival on
August 25th, 1970 and was shown recently at the San Francisco
International Film Festival. The Stanford Communications
Department is sponsoring the program which is open to the
community, free of charge.
