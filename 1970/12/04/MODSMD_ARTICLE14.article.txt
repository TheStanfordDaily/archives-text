# Drama Dept. Opens An Uneven 'Ondine'
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Drama Department
opened its Christmas show
Wednesday night with an uneven
production of Jean Giraudoux's
delightful tale of a water nymph
and a knight—"Ondine."
Considering the weather we've
been having, it may be argued that
the last thing we need is a play
about water. But "Ondine" is
potentially such a charming play
that even the cold, wet winds
whipping through Mem Aud
seemed at times, to be a bit
milder.
If only Director John
Olon-Scrymgeour had managed to
extract from the play all of the
wit, and insight, and sense of
tragedy that was to be had—how
wonderful it would have been!
For one thing, he used a
translation which was probably
much more faithful to the original
French than is the popular
Maurice Valency version; but the
French are in love with the sound
of their language, and a truly
faithful translation into English
tends to be wordy and
overwritten.
Mr. Olon's choice of
translation may be considered
incidental, but his concept of the
play is not. Giraudoux wrote a
fantasy, but as the play progresses
it begins to look like a bad dream.
The sets and lights, which in the
first act are ingenious, elaborate
and delightful, waste away until
there is nothing left for the third
act but a bare platform and some
unimaginative area lighting. It is
almost as if they ran out of
money halfway through the
production.
The stage decoration reflects
the tenor of the entire show. The
fi.st act is so lovely that one looks
forward eagerly to the next two.
But the second act is confused
and muddled, and the play never
seems to fully recover the charm
or promise of the first hour. The
third act also falters, but then M.

Giraudoux pulls it out with a
marvelous ending that even the
poor translation could not
destroy.
With all that, there is still a lot
to be said for the show. The
Drama Department played
Giraudoux, and clearly Giraudoux
won. As uneven as the play
looked on stage, the playwrights
wisdom, charm and love still
managed to reach the audience.
M. Giraudoux was a man who
delighted in the little things in
life—a wooden stool, a spoon, a
fleck of gold in a girl's eye. These
things are important to him, so
they become important to us, and
this gentle idea of what it is to be
truly human shines on the stage of
Mem Aud like the gold of
Ondine's hair.
The acting was as uneven as
Mr. Olon's direction. Mary Karen
Dahl was Ondine, the water
nymph who disregards the
warnings of her people, and
marries a human. Miss Dahl was
charming and affecting,
particularly in her final scene.
Roger Hardy was somewhat less
delightful as her husband, the
knight Hans von Wittenstein zu
Wittenstein. Hans is supposed to
be a rather ordinary fellow, not
too bright, but nice. Mr. Hardy's
treatment of him often went a bit,
but just a bit, too far, and I
personally found this rather
annoying.
Eugene Kusterer was a little
silly as the King, but Mary
Geldard dominated the stage with
a regal and wise Queen Yseult.
Terry Hinz was impressive as The
Old One, the King of the Seas,
and he came closer to saving the
second act from total confusion
than did anyone else.
To be fair, I must admit that 1
have seldom seen a long play that
held my attention so well. And M.
Giraudoux's special brand of
magic is still there in heavy, if
somewhat uneven, doses.
