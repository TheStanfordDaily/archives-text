After going through Notre
Dame as an undergraduate and
grad student, and Stanford as a
Woodrow Wilson fellow, Lee
Foster decided to apply his
writing and photography talents
to books. In doing so, Foster
added support to the theory that
great schools don't necessarily
produce great authors. However
the fruits of Foster's labors do
possess an interesting flavor and
are worth looking into.
The first of Foster's works,
The Message of April Fools, is a
novel about a "promising
Stanford University freshman,"
who lives in a world "collapsing
outside and inside him." Knowing
this much, the average Daily
reader can fill in the blanks. In
the early chapters the protagonist
has jumped into his TR3 and

arrived at Wilbur Hall. By page 39
he has seen his advisor and a
psychologist at the Health Center,
and by page 62 he has already
shed the mantle of his virginity
with a likely coed with the name
of Lucille Van Overloop. This of
course is only the beginning and
in the course of the book he is
turned on, spaced out, beaten up,
flunked, rejected, and classified
I-A.
The central difficulty of the
novel is that so much happens to
this unsuspecting freshman that
he becomes a caricature rather
than a character. From the
stereotypes of cheating on exams
to students having affairs with
their cars, the characters seem to
have been left by the author
without a second dimension.
Foster achieves a new high in
stereotypes where every being
conforms perfectly to what his
image has traditionally been,
whether it be the unconcerned
R.A. who hates freshman but
needs the money, the inadequate

psychologist who doesn't want a
student suicide blotting his
record, or the free thinking acid
head who drops out of school to
do his thing and fill his bag.
Although the back cover
promises that "the reader will find
this salient novel says more about
the tensions of America's younger
generation that a pyramid of
commissioned reports," the reader
will more likely find the story
nothing that he hasn't in some
way experienced by merely being
a student. The comparison of a
developing individual's
experiences in the familiar
environment of this ivory tower
to your own are what make the
novel merit reading.
Just 25 Cents and Three
Wheaties Boxtops, provides
another opportunity for
comparison to the reader where
he can compare the author's
emotions as he developed to his
own. The combination of prose
and photographs is basically
autobiographical. The book

records with words and visual
images the impressions of a young
boy growing up in a small
Minnesota town. If nostalgic
images of vacant lots, old
sneakers, gooey Hershey bars, and
Thanksgiving at grandma's don't
excite you then the more more
philosophical aspects of the book
may.
Foster traces the conflicts
between a strong religious
background and what he wanted
to do with his life. A dichotomy
existed between the sacred aspects
of thought and the secular aspects
of life. In tracing the various foci
of his life, the author tells us that
"the boy looked to the lakes and
woods and youthful sports, like
baseball; then to U.S. News; then
to the Catholic priesthood; then
to math and economics; then to
his father's factory; then to the
Great Books (Foster received his
undergraduate degree in Great
Books); then to Europe; then to
literature; then to America; and

finally to his own books and
photographs."
In the writing of this
autobiography, Foster refers to
himself throughout as"the boy"
rather than writing in the first
person. After a few dozen pages
this can get to be a bit much,
considering that at least every
other sentence contains this

reference. The monotony of this
is interspersed with some very
refreshing camera work. Working
in balck and white, Foster
captures both very minute detail
and very broad moods through his
camera lens. The photographs not
only relate to his story but also
seem to contain a story of their
own which the reader can fill in
for himself.

Because Lee Foster is a former
Stanford student and a local
author (now living in Woodside)
both books offer the reader
opportunities to compare his
experiences with those of th?
author in similar situations. While
the reader may find his own
insights into the same situations
more meaningful, the comparison
is nonetheless interesting.


SNIPS AND SNAILS—A Stanford graduate student-turned author, Lee Foster has put together this
montage of boyhood favorites to treat us all to a glimpse of the way things were when he was a boy long
long ago.

"the boy looked to the lakes and
woods and youthful sports, like
baseball; then to U.S. News; then
to the Catholic priesthood; then
to math and economics; then to
his father's factory; then to the
Great Books (Foster received his
undergraduate degree in Great
Books); then to Europe; then to
literature; then to America; and

finally to his own books and
photographs."
In the writing of this
autobiography, Foster refers to
himself throughout as"the boy"
rather than writing in the first
person. After a few dozen pages
this can get to be a bit much,
considering that at least every
other sentence contains this

reference. The monotony of this
is interspersed with some very
refreshing camera work. Working
in balck and white, Foster
captures both very minute detail
and very broad moods through his
camera lens. The photographs not
only relate to his story but also
seem to contain a story of their
own which the reader can fill in
for himself.

Because Lee Foster is a former
Stanford student and a local
author (now living in Woodside)
both books offer the reader
opportunities to compare his
experiences with those of th?
author in similar situations. While
the reader may find his own
insights into the same situations
more meaningful, the comparison
is nonetheless interesting.


SNIPS AND SNAILS—A Stanford graduate student-turned author, Lee Foster has put together this
montage of boyhood favorites to treat us all to a glimpse of the way things were when he was a boy long
long ago.

JUST 25 CENTS AND THREE
WHEATIES BOXTOPS $4.95
Pacific Coast Publishers
After going through Notre
Dame as an undergraduate and
grad student, and Stanford as a
Woodrow Wilson fellow, Lee
Foster decided to apply his
writing and photography talents
to books. In doing so, Foster
added support to the theory that
great schools don't necessarily
produce great authors. However
the fruits of Foster's labors do
possess an interesting flavor and
are worth looking into.
The first of Foster's works,
The Message of April Fools, is a
novel about a "promising
Stanford University freshman,"
who lives in a world "collapsing
outside and inside him." Knowing
this much, the average Daily
reader can fill in the blanks. In
the early chapters the protagonist
has jumped into his TR3 and

arrived at Wilbur Hall. By page 39
he has seen his advisor and a
psychologist at the Health Center,
and by page 62 he has already
shed the mantle of his virginity
with a likely coed with the name
of Lucille Van Overloop. This of
course is only the beginning and
in the course of the book he is
turned on, spaced out, beaten up,
flunked, rejected, and classified
I-A.
The central difficulty of the
novel is that so much happens to
this unsuspecting freshman that
he becomes a caricature rather
than a character. From the
stereotypes of cheating on exams
to students having affairs with
their cars, the characters seem to
have been left by the author
without a second dimension.
Foster achieves a new high in
stereotypes where every being
conforms perfectly to what his
image has traditionally been,
whether it be the unconcerned
R.A. who hates freshman but
needs the money, the inadequate

psychologist who doesn't want a
student suicide blotting his
record, or the free thinking acid
head who drops out of school to
do his thing and fill his bag.
Although the back cover
promises that "the reader will find
this salient novel says more about
the tensions of America's younger
generation that a pyramid of
commissioned reports," the reader
will more likely find the story
nothing that he hasn't in some
way experienced by merely being
a student. The comparison of a
developing individual's
experiences in the familiar
environment of this ivory tower
to your own are what make the
novel merit reading.
Just 25 Cents and Three
Wheaties Boxtops, provides
another opportunity for
comparison to the reader where
he can compare the author's
emotions as he developed to his
own. The combination of prose
and photographs is basically
autobiographical. The book

records with words and visual
images the impressions of a young
boy growing up in a small
Minnesota town. If nostalgic
images of vacant lots, old
sneakers, gooey Hershey bars, and
Thanksgiving at grandma's don't
excite you then the more more
philosophical aspects of the book
may.
Foster traces the conflicts
between a strong religious
background and what he wanted
to do with his life. A dichotomy
existed between the sacred aspects
of thought and the secular aspects
of life. In tracing the various foci
of his life, the author tells us that
"the boy looked to the lakes and
woods and youthful sports, like
baseball; then to U.S. News; then
to the Catholic priesthood; then

whether it be the unconcerned
R.A. who hates freshman but
needs the money, the inadequate

psychologist who doesn't want a
student suicide blotting his
record, or the free thinking acid
head who drops out of school to
do his thing and fill his bag.
Although the back cover
promises that "the reader will find
this salient novel says more about
the tensions of America's younger
generation that a pyramid of
commissioned reports," the reader
will more likely find the story
nothing that he hasn't in some
way experienced by merely being
a student. The comparison of a
developing individual's
experiences in the familiar
environment of this ivory tower
to your own are what make the
novel merit reading.
Just 25 Cents and Three
Wheaties Boxtops, provides
another opportunity for
comparison to the reader where
he can compare the author's
emotions as he developed to his
own. The combination of prose
and photographs is basically
autobiographical. The book

records with words and visual
images the impressions of a young
boy growing up in a small
Minnesota town. If nostalgic
images of vacant lots, old
sneakers, gooey Hershey bars, and
Thanksgiving at grandma's don't
excite you then the more more
philosophical aspects of the book
may.
Foster traces the conflicts
between a strong religious
background and what he wanted
to do with his life. A dichotomy
existed between the sacred aspects
of thought and the secular aspects
of life. In tracing the various foci
of his life, the author tells us that
"the boy looked to the lakes and
woods and youthful sports, like
baseball; then to U.S. News; then
to the Catholic priesthood; then
to math and economics; then to
his father's factory; then to the
Great Books (Foster received his
undergraduate degree in Great
Books); then to Europe; then to
literature; then to America; and

finally to his own books and
photographs."
In the writing of this
autobiography, Foster refers to
himself throughout as"the boy"
rather than writing in the first
person. After a few dozen pages
this can get to be a bit much,
considering that at least every
other sentence contains this

reference. The monotony of this
is interspersed with some very
refreshing camera work. Working
in balck and white, Foster
captures both very minute detail
and very broad moods through his
camera lens. The photographs not
only relate to his story but also
seem to contain a story of their
own which the reader can fill in
for himself.

Because Lee Foster is a former
Stanford student and a local
author (now living in Woodside)
both books offer the reader
opportunities to compare his
experiences with those of th?
author in similar situations. While
the reader may find his own
insights into the same situations
more meaningful, the comparison
is nonetheless interesting.


SNIPS AND SNAILS—A Stanford graduate student-turned author, Lee Foster has put together this
montage of boyhood favorites to treat us all to a glimpse of the way things were when he was a boy long
long ago.
