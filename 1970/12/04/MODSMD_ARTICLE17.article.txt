# Cagers Face Pair With BYU
## 
### 
It could be one of the less-hospitable road trips this
weekend for Stanford's basketball team which travels to
Provo, Utah, for games Friday and Saturday with Brigham
Young University.
Stanford decided just over a year ago to sever athletic
involvement with BYU because of racial policies of the
Mormon Church.
These two games terminate the scheduled athletic
commitments between the two universities. Stanford wasn't
particularly popular in the Provo environs after the decision
was announced.

in Stanford's opening victory against USF; below, guard
John Stratton does some Indian wrestling with an opponent
on a jump ball.
Below, right, forward Pat Stevens raises a clinched
fist-not in social protest in this case, but admitting to a
personal foul.
