# Grapple Season Opens
## 
### 
Elbows and knees return
officially to the wrestling mats
tomorrow when Stanford's varsity
wrestlers embark on a new season
at the 14 th annual San Jose State
Invitational Wrestling
Tournament.
Co-captains Dave Thomas
(142) and Dave Kopolow (118)
lead what Coach Dave Reed calls a
"young, well-balanced and
talented group of wrestlers."
Stanford could put together its
strongest dual meet record in
history, Reed figures.

Kopolow and sophomore
teammate Ray Williams were both
second in the SJS tourney and
should be shooting for first this
time around, according to Reed.
Last year both Williams and
Thomas finished fourth in the
Pacific-8 Conference Tournament.
Other probable starters for the
Tribe include Matt Haynes (118 );
Ken Krebs (134); Chris Horpel
(15 0); Jerry Ross (158); Bob
Schloutz (167); and Hal Hothan
(190).
