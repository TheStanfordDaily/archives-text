# White And McGuire — Worlds Apart
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Ray White handles himself
cautiously. He wears steel-toed boots,
locks his doors securely each night, and
keeps a loaded pistol near him. He talks
in quick, pointed bursts, and only
reluctantly does he give a fuller answer.
"I'm one of those nasty guys that
believes in capitalism," he smiles. White
brands himself a "libertarian
conservative" and is currently chairman
of the Free Campus Movement, a
splinter group disenchanted with the
mainstay conservatism of the Young
Americans for Freedom.
White only recently emerged as a
campus figure. Last year he and others
in FCM trailed after radical groups in
the spring trying to identify the rock
throwers. Last Monday night, a band of
radicals fought with him after he left an
anti-war meeting because he has served
as such a persistent opponent and
witness in court prosecution of some
protesters.
In explaining his group's efforts,
White says, "We happen to care the
most because we have the most at
stake."
In discussing his politics he
emphasizies the importance of personal
choice constantly. "The radical thrust
has been against ROTC existing on
campus. This eliminates a choice on the
part of the students. Likewise, the
elimination of classified research
eliminates the freedom of a professor
to do what he wants in his spare time."
White refuses to be an apologist for
U.S.'s economic system, choosing to be
an enthusiast instead. "The obvious
advantage of capitalism, as restricted as
it is in this country, is that you have
the greatest amount of upward
mobility of any society the world has
ever seen." For, he claims, "capitalism
provides the most amount of individual
freedom."
So far this year, the spokesman for
the New Right has devoted his public
actions to keeping tabs on the radical
movement. "I've quite consistently
attempted to identify any individuals
that have attempted to assert their
political decisions on the lives of others
by force," says White.
He rejects any notion of vigilantism.
"It is the responsibility of the
university to fulfill these functions, and

it has not been doing its duty for the
past three years."
Left Political Theories
White has little respect for the Left's
political theories. He opposes any ban
on classified research and declares, "I
don't see excluding people from doing
this work that the American people are
going to vote to pay for."
On ecology he feels the problem is
only worsened by government
interference. "Private property is a key
to the whole environment issue,"
claims White. If all waterways and land
were privately held, owners could sue
polluters directly rather than rely on
weak, unenforced laws.
Trashing particularly angers White.
"I've heard the argument that you
shouldn't do anything to them
(protesters) because the government is
killing people in Vietnam. But I don't
understand how destroying a window on
campus helps a Vietnamese child not be
bombed."
He is confident that his politics are
held by many. "Certainly the vast
majority in the community agree that
rock throwers should be apprehended."
Radicals, he feels, are "alienating
more and more of society. Their
revolution is becoming less and less
feasible. The movement is afflicted
with vanguardism: the most violent, the
most far-out people lead."

Diarmuid McGuire hardly lives up to
the popular image of loud, accusatory
radical with a rumpled, unkept
appearance. Instead he talks in a gently
serious monotone, carefully phrasing
each sentence. He keeps his hair neatly
short and in conversation he seems Loo
shy even to return a stare.
Though his manner may not fit
expectations, his words leave little
doubt. "I accept the idea of armed
revolution. Specifically, the people on
the bottom of the system today have to
take power in their own name instead
of having it concentrated in the hands
of an elite," says McGuire.
He admires Communist China. "The
people there have accomplished
fantastic things. Politically they have
transformed an entire nation of 700
million in terms of consciousness and
culture. And they've been very honest
about their mistakes," he added.
The former communications grad
student came to his political
conclusions through "my own personal
experience." He worked for McCarthy
and remembered his campaign
statement "to the effect that this was
the last chance for the democratic
process to prove that it was flexible.
His workers were beaten and maced by
the Chicago pigs. McCarthy was offed,
he was steam-rollered. I don't know of
a more dramatic statement."
Achieve
On campus McGuire was active in
the OFF-ROTC protests last spring and
eventually went to jail on the
testimony of Ray White. In early
October he wrote a column for the
Daily from jail and explained
revolutionaries should "take care of
snitches."
The column aroused a storm of
controversy and endangered among
other things McGuire's parole status
which White actively sought to have
revoke. Today McGuire is scheduled to
appear in court tp discuss his alleged
parole violations. "It makes me feel
awful about going back to jail," he said
quietly. "It's hard enough to get a job
without this behind me. But jail itself —
it's the worst side of every impersonal
institution concentrated in one place."
How does he feel about the person
who turned him in? "1 think Ray White

is insignificant. I don't think he
understands the world very well. It's
just too complex for that rampant
Plymouth Rock kind of individualism
that he talks about," he said.
"The sad thing about Ray White is
that he takes something that is really
good—the idea of freedom—and turns it
into something weird, an ideal that's
used to justify all kinds of crime like
the Vietnam war, ROTC, the FBI,"
added Mc(!uire, shaking his head.
Bleak Future
Despite his own bleak future,
McGuire has great faith in a coming
revolution. "People learn about their
own alienation, but what doesn't come
to them spontaneously is the idea that
there is a way out. There has to be
somebody there with some ideas, some
kind of theory," he feels.
"There are a lot of signs that it's
coming. What's happening is that a lot
of young people in this country are
beginning to realize that they don't
want to identify with the interests of
their own nation. What they admire are
the courageous, self-sacrificing people
that are fighting against the same
system. They see people with that kind
of bravery and then they soc a creep
like Ray White come along and deny
those people everything and attempt to
destroy the movement that's forming in
solidarity with those people," said
McGuire.

it's the worst side of every impersonal
institution concentrated in one place."
How does he feel about the person
who turned him in? "1 think Ray White

is insignificant. I don't think he
understands the world very well. It's
just too complex for that rampant
Plymouth Rock kind of individualism
that he talks about," he said.
"The sad thing about Ray White is
that he takes something that is really
good—the idea of freedom—and turns it
into something weird, an ideal that's
used to justify all kinds of crime like
the Vietnam war, ROTC, the FBI,"
added Mc(!uire, shaking his head.
Bleak Future
Despite his own bleak future,
McGuire has great faith in a coming
revolution. "People learn about their
own alienation, but what doesn't come
to them spontaneously is the idea that
there is a way out. There has to be
somebody there with some ideas, some
kind of theory," he feels.
"There are a lot of signs that it's
coming. What's happening is that a lot
of young people in this country are
beginning to realize that they don't
want to identify with the interests of
their own nation. What they admire are
the courageous, self-sacrificing people
that are fighting against the same
system. They see people with that kind
of bravery and then they soc a creep
like Ray White come along and deny
those people everything and attempt to
destroy the movement that's forming in
solidarity with those people," said
McGuire.

D. McGuire
Ray White handles himself
cautiously. He wears steel-toed boots,
locks his doors securely each night, and
keeps a loaded pistol near him. He talks
in quick, pointed bursts, and only
reluctantly does he give a fuller answer.
"I'm one of those nasty guys that
believes in capitalism," he smiles. White
brands himself a "libertarian
conservative" and is currently chairman
of the Free Campus Movement, a
splinter group disenchanted with the
mainstay conservatism of the Young
Americans for Freedom.
White only recently emerged as a
campus figure. Last year he and others
in FCM trailed after radical groups in
the spring trying to identify the rock
throwers. Last Monday night, a band of
radicals fought with him after he left an
anti-war meeting because he has served
as such a persistent opponent and
witness in court prosecution of some
protesters.
In explaining his group's efforts,
White says, "We happen to care the
most because we have the most at
stake."
In discussing his politics he
emphasizies the importance of personal
choice constantly. "The radical thrust
has been against ROTC existing on
campus. This eliminates a choice on the
part of the students. Likewise, the
elimination of classified research
eliminates the freedom of a professor
to do what he wants in his spare time."
White refuses to be an apologist for
U.S.'s economic system, choosing to be
an enthusiast instead. "The obvious
advantage of capitalism, as restricted as
it is in this country, is that you have
the greatest amount of upward
mobility of any society the world has
ever seen." For, he claims, "capitalism
provides the most amount of individual
freedom."
So far this year, the spokesman for
the New Right has devoted his public
actions to keeping tabs on the radical
movement. "I've quite consistently
attempted to identify any individuals
that have attempted to assert their
political decisions on the lives of others
by force," says White.
He rejects any notion of vigilantism.
"It is the responsibility of the
university to fulfill these functions, and

it has not been doing its duty for the
past three years."
Left Political Theories
White has little respect for the Left's
political theories. He opposes any ban
on classified research and declares, "I
don't see excluding people from doing
this work that the American people are
going to vote to pay for."
On ecology he feels the problem is
only worsened by government
interference. "Private property is a key
to the whole environment issue,"
claims White. If all waterways and land
were privately held, owners could sue
polluters directly rather than rely on
weak, unenforced laws.
Trashing particularly angers White.
"I've heard the argument that you
shouldn't do anything to them
(protesters) because the government is
killing people in Vietnam. But I don't
understand how destroying a window on
campus helps a Vietnamese child not be
bombed."
He is confident that his politics are
held by many. "Certainly the vast
majority in the community agree that
rock throwers should be apprehended."
Radicals, he feels, are "alienating
more and more of society. Their
revolution is becoming less and less
feasible. The movement is afflicted
with vanguardism: the most violent, the
most far-out people lead."

Diarmuid McGuire hardly lives up to
the popular image of loud, accusatory
radical with a rumpled, unkept
appearance. Instead he talks in a gently
serious monotone, carefully phrasing
each sentence. He keeps his hair neatly
short and in conversation he seems Loo
shy even to return a stare.
Though his manner may not fit
expectations, his words leave little
doubt. "I accept the idea of armed
revolution. Specifically, the people on
the bottom of the system today have to
take power in their own name instead
of having it concentrated in the hands
of an elite," says McGuire.
He admires Communist China. "The
people there have accomplished
fantastic things. Politically they have
transformed an entire nation of 700
million in terms of consciousness and
culture. And they've been very honest
about their mistakes," he added.
The former communications grad
student came to his political
conclusions through "my own personal
experience." He worked for McCarthy
and remembered his campaign
statement "to the effect that this was
the last chance for the democratic
process to prove that it was flexible.
His workers were beaten and maced by
the Chicago pigs. McCarthy was offed,
he was steam-rollered. I don't know of
a more dramatic statement."
Achieve
On campus McGuire was active in
the OFF-ROTC protests last spring and
eventually went to jail on the
testimony of Ray White. In early
October he wrote a column for the
Daily from jail and explained
revolutionaries should "take care of
snitches."
The column aroused a storm of
controversy and endangered among
other things McGuire's parole status
which White actively sought to have
revoke. Today McGuire is scheduled to
appear in court tp discuss his alleged
parole violations. "It makes me feel
awful about going back to jail," he said
quietly. "It's hard enough to get a job
without this behind me. But jail itself —
it's the worst side of every impersonal
institution concentrated in one place."
How does he feel about the person
who turned him in? "1 think Ray White

doubt. "I accept the idea of armed
revolution. Specifically, the people on
the bottom of the system today have to
take power in their own name instead
of having it concentrated in the hands
of an elite," says McGuire.
He admires Communist China. "The
people there have accomplished
fantastic things. Politically they have
transformed an entire nation of 700
million in terms of consciousness and
culture. And they've been very honest
about their mistakes," he added.
The former communications grad
student came to his political
conclusions through "my own personal
experience." He worked for McCarthy
and remembered his campaign
statement "to the effect that this was
the last chance for the democratic
process to prove that it was flexible.
His workers were beaten and maced by
the Chicago pigs. McCarthy was offed,
he was steam-rollered. I don't know of
a more dramatic statement."
Achieve
On campus McGuire was active in
the OFF-ROTC protests last spring and
eventually went to jail on the
testimony of Ray White. In early
October he wrote a column for the
Daily from jail and explained
revolutionaries should "take care of
snitches."
The column aroused a storm of
controversy and endangered among
other things McGuire's parole status
which White actively sought to have
revoke. Today McGuire is scheduled to
appear in court tp discuss his alleged
parole violations. "It makes me feel
awful about going back to jail," he said
quietly. "It's hard enough to get a job
without this behind me. But jail itself —
it's the worst side of every impersonal
institution concentrated in one place."
How does he feel about the person
who turned him in? "1 think Ray White

is insignificant. I don't think he
understands the world very well. It's
just too complex for that rampant
Plymouth Rock kind of individualism
that he talks about," he said.
"The sad thing about Ray White is
that he takes something that is really
good—the idea of freedom—and turns it
into something weird, an ideal that's
used to justify all kinds of crime like
the Vietnam war, ROTC, the FBI,"
added Mc(!uire, shaking his head.
Bleak Future
Despite his own bleak future,
McGuire has great faith in a coming
revolution. "People learn about their
own alienation, but what doesn't come
to them spontaneously is the idea that
there is a way out. There has to be
somebody there with some ideas, some
kind of theory," he feels.
"There are a lot of signs that it's
coming. What's happening is that a lot
of young people in this country are
beginning to realize that they don't
want to identify with the interests of
their own nation. What they admire are
the courageous, self-sacrificing people
that are fighting against the same
system. They see people with that kind
of bravery and then they soc a creep
like Ray White come along and deny
those people everything and attempt to
destroy the movement that's forming in
solidarity with those people," said
McGuire.

D. McGuire
Ray White handles himself
cautiously. He wears steel-toed boots,
locks his doors securely each night, and
keeps a loaded pistol near him. He talks
in quick, pointed bursts, and only
reluctantly does he give a fuller answer.
"I'm one of those nasty guys that
believes in capitalism," he smiles. White
brands himself a "libertarian
conservative" and is currently chairman
of the Free Campus Movement, a
splinter group disenchanted with the
mainstay conservatism of the Young
Americans for Freedom.
White only recently emerged as a
campus figure. Last year he and others
in FCM trailed after radical groups in
the spring trying to identify the rock
throwers. Last Monday night, a band of
radicals fought with him after he left an
anti-war meeting because he has served
as such a persistent opponent and
witness in court prosecution of some
protesters.
In explaining his group's efforts,
White says, "We happen to care the
most because we have the most at
stake."
In discussing his politics he
emphasizies the importance of personal
choice constantly. "The radical thrust
has been against ROTC existing on
campus. This eliminates a choice on the
part of the students. Likewise, the
elimination of classified research
eliminates the freedom of a professor
to do what he wants in his spare time."
White refuses to be an apologist for
U.S.'s economic system, choosing to be
an enthusiast instead. "The obvious
advantage of capitalism, as restricted as
it is in this country, is that you have
the greatest amount of upward
mobility of any society the world has
ever seen." For, he claims, "capitalism
provides the most amount of individual
freedom."
So far this year, the spokesman for
the New Right has devoted his public
actions to keeping tabs on the radical
movement. "I've quite consistently
attempted to identify any individuals
that have attempted to assert their
political decisions on the lives of others
by force," says White.
He rejects any notion of vigilantism.
"It is the responsibility of the
university to fulfill these functions, and

it has not been doing its duty for the
past three years."
Left Political Theories
White has little respect for the Left's
political theories. He opposes any ban
on classified research and declares, "I
don't see excluding people from doing
this work that the American people are
going to vote to pay for."
On ecology he feels the problem is
only worsened by government
interference. "Private property is a key
to the whole environment issue,"
claims White. If all waterways and land
were privately held, owners could sue
polluters directly rather than rely on
weak, unenforced laws.
Trashing particularly angers White.
"I've heard the argument that you
shouldn't do anything to them
(protesters) because the government is
killing people in Vietnam. But I don't
understand how destroying a window on
campus helps a Vietnamese child not be
bombed."
He is confident that his politics are
held by many. "Certainly the vast
majority in the community agree that
rock throwers should be apprehended."
Radicals, he feels, are "alienating
more and more of society. Their
revolution is becoming less and less
feasible. The movement is afflicted
with vanguardism: the most violent, the
most far-out people lead."

Diarmuid McGuire hardly lives up to
the popular image of loud, accusatory
radical with a rumpled, unkept
appearance. Instead he talks in a gently
serious monotone, carefully phrasing
each sentence. He keeps his hair neatly
short and in conversation he seems Loo
shy even to return a stare.
Though his manner may not fit
expectations, his words leave little
doubt. "I accept the idea of armed
revolution. Specifically, the people on
the bottom of the system today have to
take power in their own name instead
