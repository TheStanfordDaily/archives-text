## Football Season Ends 
### 
Four intramural football teams
were still in the running
Wednesday for the esteemed IM
championship after three rounds
of playoff action.
The finals, according to the 1M
office, will probably be played
next Monday at 4 p.m. in the
intramural fields near Stanford
Stadium.
In Wednesday's third round
play, The Dislocations stayed alive
by dumping the Phi Delts 37-21
and the Zetes clobbered DU, 33-6.
The KAs edged SAE 18-14 in a
thriller and the Theta Delts
socked it to Law 11, 4 4-0
In that Theta D' romp,
quarterback Ron Brix 'hree
touchdown passes anu iau for
another himself, feats which were
all the more interesting since Brix

had never played quarterback in
his life before.
The Theta Delt defense kept
the budding lawyers in check all
afternoon and on the third play of
the game Theta Delt Dave
Chambers picked of" an errant
pass and ran it back for a
touchdown.
KA quarterback ScotV
Stillinger hurled three scoring
passes-all caught by Marty
O'Donahueâ€”to lead his squad to
the narrow win over SAE. Dave
Schaeffer pitched two scoring
bombs for the losers.
Second round scores:
Dislocations 31, Sigma Chi 6 ; Phi
Delts 13, Toro 6; Zetes 12,
Cardenal 0; DU 32, Lagunita 20;
KA 12 , Law 111 7 ; SAE 12 , Loro
