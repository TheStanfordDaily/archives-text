SST Defeated
WASHINGTON — The Senate voted Thursday to scrap
President Nixon's plans to continue massive federal aid
to develop an American commercial supersonic
transport (SST) plane.
The vote was 5 2 to 41.
The vote, a defeat for the President, was a
long-sought triumph for senators who said they viewed
a worldwide fleet of the faster-than-sound planes as an
environmental monster and a taxpayer's nightmare.
By its roll call vote, the Senate approved an
amendment by Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis., striking
a $290 million fund to develop two SST proto-types
from the pending $7 billion transportation
appropriations bill for fiscal 1971.
Victory for the Proxmire amendment came in the
face of senators who claimed that blocking the SST
would doom American supremacy in the world's
aircraft markets and stymie the advance of U.S.
technology.
Other SST supporters said that stopping the
prototype program will mean 30,00 oAmerican workers
will be laid off their jobs by Christmas.
In a flurry of last-minute action Wednesday, SST
backers won points among undecided senators by
passing separate legislation which meets some of the
worries of critics head-on: The sonic boom and
excessive airport noise.
Cross Freed
MONTREAL — British envoy James R. Cross was
rescued Thursday from nearly two months of captivity
at the hands of Quebec terrorists and taken to a
hospital.

Police freed him from a house in a Montreal suburb
and picked up two kidnap suspects. He rode with the
two in a police convoy to the island site of Expo 6 7 to
meet a Cuban government representative.
Premier Robert Bourassa sand Cross is apparently in
good physical shape."
Cross was kidnaped at gunpoint Oct. 5 from his
Montreal home.
Indians Win Land
TAOS PUEBLE, N.M. - Hundreds of
nature-worshiping Taos Indians gave tearful thanks in a
Christian church for the preservation of their sacred
Blue Lake.
Their reaction to the precedent-setting
Congressional decision Wednesday awarding them title
to the lake and 48,000 surrounding acres in Carson
National Forest was a study in the dual religious
attitudes of the area.
The Indians say the land and lake are sacred to their
ancient native religion. But most of them also worship
at the tiny, adobe Roman Catholic church near Taos
Pueblo, built by the early Spanish missionaries.
Heisman Awarded
NEW YORK — Jim Plunkett received the Heisman
Trophy Thursday and announced he had one more goal
as a college player — to lead Stanford to a Rose Bowl
victory over Ohio State.
The 6-foot-3 , 204-pound quarterback became the
36th player to receive the trophy, inscribed "to the
year's outstanding college football player," at New
York's Downtown Athletic Club.
