# Moody Blues Tune-In At Maples
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The Moody Blues brought a surprise
with them to Maples Pavilion last night
— Elvin Bishop. Both groups struck a
responsive chord with the 8,300
member audience.
The concert was the first one ever in
Maples, which according to Public
Events Director Tom Bachetti was lent
with "fear and trepidation" by the
athletic department.
Outfitted with $50,000 dollars
worth of new sound absorbing fixtures,
the pavilion turned out to be quite
su.'table for the event. Not only were
the a«ccoustics good, but the special
floor Which rests on springs and
bounced wfth the music added an extra
dimension tor the hundreds of
spectators who w«'re allowed to sit,

stand, dance, and freak out on tarps
which served to protect the basketball
floor.
The Elvin Bishop Group appeared
first in place of Trapeze, who were held
up by immigration authorities in San
Francisco.
Although they were not originally
scheduled to appear at all, many in the
audience found them to be the
highlight of the show. Their
performance, w'lich lasted an hour,
included "Feeling" and "Higher &
Higher."
Adam Levin, who was in charge of
the ASSU sponsored event promised to
bring them back sometime later this
year.
For the London based Moody Blues
this was the first of 11 concerts in the
United States. It also marked the first

time a major group has given an
exclusive Bay Area performance at
Stanford.
The reason they came here,
according to road manager Dave Farce,
was because the group, "appeals to an
intelligent audience." He noted that
this would probably be their least
profitable performance due to the
"very low" student ticket price of
$2.75.
The group's performance included
"Tuesday Afternoon," "Question,"
"Melancholy Man," "Nights in White
Satin," and "Legend of a Man," a song
dedicated to Timothy Leary.
Security arrangements for the
concert were not nearly as extensive as
those earlier this year at the Sly and the
Family Stone concert in Frost
Amphitheatre.
