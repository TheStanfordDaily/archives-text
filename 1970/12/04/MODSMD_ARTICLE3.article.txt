# Housing Law Pressures Communes

### CHRIS PECK 
Taped inside the front door of a
large frame house in Palo Alto is a note
which read, "If the inspector comes, do
not let him in!"
The house is a commune for thirteen
unrelated people. The inspector
mentioned in the note is from the City
of Palo Alto which is trying to pressure

communal living groups out of Palo
Alto's residential districts.
Technically, the point of contention
between Palo Alto and the more than
forty communes that are mixed
throughout the residential districts of
the city is an ordinance which forbids
more than four unrelated persons from
living together in a Palo Alto residential
zone. Underneath this facade of legal
restrictions however, is an increasingly
hostile clash of ideologies.
Robert Booth, assistant city
attorney for Palo Alto, explained the
Palo Alto ordinance against communal
and other types of group living. "One
of the primary things you try to do in a
city is to seperate kinds of uses of a
zone. You wouldn't want to have a
slaughter house next to a residence for
example," Booth said. "We try to
produce a certain number of people in
a zone so that we can plan for schools,
electricity, etc. Of course we wouldn't
ask some mother to kick out her five

children if the zone got too crowded,
but we do try to keep the number of
people in each zone under control."
Communes, Booth argues, do not
qualify as single-family residences and
overload city water and power
facilities.
Commune Raid
On November 30th, Booth's office
raided a Palo Alto commune on
Cowper Street and filed a complaint
against some members of the
commune, charging them with being in
violation of city zoning ordinances.
Booth's inspection was the first made
with a warrant and represents an
escalation of the City's hard-line policy
towards communes.
A second commune at 1001 Forest
Ave. was inspected by warrant
yesterday morning.
Three weeks ago, the Palo Alto
Human Relations Commission
recommended that the city not change
its ordinance concerning the limit of
unrelated people that can live together.
The reason for the decision according
to HRC member, John Zenger, is
"because the neighbors of communes
have problems that are greater in
number than regular
neighbors . . . There are communes
with too many dogs, too many
motorcycles coming in all night, and
rock music till two or three in the
morning."
Commune leaders in Palo Alto
disagree with the city's reasons for
trying to evict the communes from the
residential zones." It's a question of
personal style," a former Stanford
undergraduate student now living in a
commune argues. There are lots of
families I know that don't get any
trouble from the building inspecter

even though there are 14 people living
together."
The city is reluctant to admit that a
communal group is a family unit.
"Relationships between self ana
anyone else other than parents and
wives has been cut off," one angry
commune member noted. "Now we're
groping to find a more meaningful
association with human beings and the
city is trying to kill us."
Communes Not Families
The Human Relations Commission
contends that communes are not family
units." When you put five or six people
in a house, it's a boarding house," HRC
representative Zenger declared, "There
areas designed for a boarding house and
the typical residential neighbor
shouldn't have to have that kind of
neighbor."
The fact remains however, that the
city is pressuring the communes out of
the residential districts through the use
of the non-related person limit.
Realistically the ordinance, if enforced,
will force the communes out of Palo
Alto altogether. Communes having to
live in non-residential, business zones
would be unable to pay the high rent
required to house a large number of
persons.
The Palo Alto Tenants Union has
filed a case in district court on behalf
of the communes, charging the City of
Palo Alto with discriminatory zoning
laws. The case does not appear likely to
succeed in overturning the zoning
ordinance however, even though one
PATU official said, "I think we have a
good chance at least in the higher
courts."
While the court case drags on, the
situation between the communes and
the City rapidly worsen.
Whether or not the communes will
survive will ultimately depend on their
ability to relate to the community
around them.
"We made some mistakes when we
first came," Mills Matheison admits,"
we didn't talk to our neighbors. Now
we've made contact with the people
around us and everybody is a lot less
paranoid."
The Palo Alto community has been
slow to accept the communes however,
and may never completely accept them
as neighbors. "We received a report that
the property values where communes
are located are declining," one
disgruntled neighbor grumbled.
Both sides seem committed to their

position. Human Relations men Zenger
summer up the City's position saying,
"It's clearly a case of the majority of
the people outruling a minority. That's
the way this county works so the
communes will have to react to that."
From the communes standpoint the
reaction won't come from their side,
but from the City. One leader summed
up the communal position out of a
Communal magazine called, The Green
Revolution. "We will build now what it
is we want in the future," read the
determined voice,"and society will have
to react to that. It will have to let us
build it or it will have to punish us for
building it. If it punishes us for
building, we believe we can build
support around that vision of the
future and defend it."

good chance at least in the higher
courts."
While the court case drags on, the
situation between the communes and
the City rapidly worsen.
Whether or not the communes will
survive will ultimately depend on their
ability to relate to the community
around them.
"We made some mistakes when we
first came," Mills Matheison admits,"
we didn't talk to our neighbors. Now
we've made contact with the people
around us and everybody is a lot less
paranoid."
The Palo Alto community has been
slow to accept the communes however,
and may never completely accept them
as neighbors. "We received a report that
the property values where communes
are located are declining," one
disgruntled neighbor grumbled.
Both sides seem committed to their

position. Human Relations men Zenger
summer up the City's position saying,
"It's clearly a case of the majority of
the people outruling a minority. That's
the way this county works so the
communes will have to react to that."
From the communes standpoint the
reaction won't come from their side,
but from the City. One leader summed
up the communal position out of a
Communal magazine called, The Green
Revolution. "We will build now what it
is we want in the future," read the
determined voice,"and society will have
to react to that. It will have to let us
build it or it will have to punish us for
building it. If it punishes us for
building, we believe we can build
support around that vision of the
future and defend it."
Taped inside the front door of a
large frame house in Palo Alto is a note
which read, "If the inspector comes, do
not let him in!"
The house is a commune for thirteen
unrelated people. The inspector
mentioned in the note is from the City
of Palo Alto which is trying to pressure

communal living groups out of Palo
Alto's residential districts.
Technically, the point of contention
between Palo Alto and the more than
forty communes that are mixed
throughout the residential districts of
the city is an ordinance which forbids
more than four unrelated persons from
living together in a Palo Alto residential
zone. Underneath this facade of legal
restrictions however, is an increasingly
hostile clash of ideologies.
Robert Booth, assistant city
attorney for Palo Alto, explained the
Palo Alto ordinance against communal
and other types of group living. "One
of the primary things you try to do in a
city is to seperate kinds of uses of a
zone. You wouldn't want to have a
slaughter house next to a residence for
example," Booth said. "We try to
produce a certain number of people in
a zone so that we can plan for schools,
electricity, etc. Of course we wouldn't
ask some mother to kick out her five

children if the zone got too crowded,
but we do try to keep the number of
people in each zone under control."
Communes, Booth argues, do not
qualify as single-family residences and
overload city water and power
facilities.
Commune Raid
On November 30th, Booth's office
raided a Palo Alto commune on
Cowper Street and filed a complaint
against some members of the
commune, charging them with being in
violation of city zoning ordinances.
Booth's inspection was the first made
with a warrant and represents an
escalation of the City's hard-line policy
towards communes.
A second commune at 1001 Forest
Ave. was inspected by warrant
yesterday morning.
Three weeks ago, the Palo Alto
Human Relations Commission
recommended that the city not change
its ordinance concerning the limit of
unrelated people that can live together.
The reason for the decision according
to HRC member, John Zenger, is
"because the neighbors of communes
have problems that are greater in
number than regular
neighbors . . . There are communes
with too many dogs, too many
motorcycles coming in all night, and
rock music till two or three in the
morning."
Commune leaders in Palo Alto
disagree with the city's reasons for
trying to evict the communes from the
residential zones." It's a question of
personal style," a former Stanford
undergraduate student now living in a
commune argues. There are lots of
families I know that don't get any
trouble from the building inspecter

even though there are 14 people living
together."
The city is reluctant to admit that a
communal group is a family unit.
"Relationships between self ana
anyone else other than parents and
wives has been cut off," one angry
commune member noted. "Now we're
groping to find a more meaningful
association with human beings and the
city is trying to kill us."
Communes Not Families
The Human Relations Commission
contends that communes are not family
units." When you put five or six people
in a house, it's a boarding house," HRC
representative Zenger declared, "There
areas designed for a boarding house and
the typical residential neighbor
shouldn't have to have that kind of
neighbor."
The fact remains however, that the
city is pressuring the communes out of
the residential districts through the use
of the non-related person limit.
Realistically the ordinance, if enforced,
will force the communes out of Palo
Alto altogether. Communes having to
live in non-residential, business zones
would be unable to pay the high rent
required to house a large number of
persons.
The Palo Alto Tenants Union has
filed a case in district court on behalf
of the communes, charging the City of
Palo Alto with discriminatory zoning
laws. The case does not appear likely to
succeed in overturning the zoning
ordinance however, even though one
PATU official said, "I think we have a
good chance at least in the higher
courts."
While the court case drags on, the
situation between the communes and

undergraduate student now living in a
commune argues. There are lots of
families I know that don't get any
trouble from the building inspecter

even though there are 14 people living
together."
The city is reluctant to admit that a
communal group is a family unit.
"Relationships between self ana
anyone else other than parents and
wives has been cut off," one angry
commune member noted. "Now we're
groping to find a more meaningful
association with human beings and the
city is trying to kill us."
Communes Not Families
The Human Relations Commission
contends that communes are not family
units." When you put five or six people
in a house, it's a boarding house," HRC
representative Zenger declared, "There
areas designed for a boarding house and
the typical residential neighbor
shouldn't have to have that kind of
neighbor."
The fact remains however, that the
city is pressuring the communes out of
the residential districts through the use
of the non-related person limit.
Realistically the ordinance, if enforced,
will force the communes out of Palo
Alto altogether. Communes having to
live in non-residential, business zones
would be unable to pay the high rent
required to house a large number of
persons.
The Palo Alto Tenants Union has
filed a case in district court on behalf
of the communes, charging the City of
Palo Alto with discriminatory zoning
laws. The case does not appear likely to
succeed in overturning the zoning
ordinance however, even though one
PATU official said, "I think we have a
good chance at least in the higher
courts."
While the court case drags on, the
situation between the communes and
the City rapidly worsen.
Whether or not the communes will
survive will ultimately depend on their
ability to relate to the community
around them.
"We made some mistakes when we
first came," Mills Matheison admits,"
we didn't talk to our neighbors. Now
we've made contact with the people
around us and everybody is a lot less
paranoid."
The Palo Alto community has been
slow to accept the communes however,
and may never completely accept them
as neighbors. "We received a report that
the property values where communes
are located are declining," one
disgruntled neighbor grumbled.
Both sides seem committed to their

position. Human Relations men Zenger
summer up the City's position saying,
"It's clearly a case of the majority of
the people outruling a minority. That's
the way this county works so the
communes will have to react to that."
From the communes standpoint the
reaction won't come from their side,
but from the City. One leader summed
up the communal position out of a
Communal magazine called, The Green
Revolution. "We will build now what it
is we want in the future," read the
determined voice,"and society will have
to react to that. It will have to let us
build it or it will have to punish us for
building it. If it punishes us for
building, we believe we can build
support around that vision of the
future and defend it."
Taped inside the front door of a
large frame house in Palo Alto is a note
which read, "If the inspector comes, do
not let him in!"
The house is a commune for thirteen
unrelated people. The inspector
mentioned in the note is from the City
of Palo Alto which is trying to pressure

communal living groups out of Palo
Alto's residential districts.
Technically, the point of contention
between Palo Alto and the more than
forty communes that are mixed
throughout the residential districts of
the city is an ordinance which forbids
more than four unrelated persons from
living together in a Palo Alto residential
zone. Underneath this facade of legal
restrictions however, is an increasingly
hostile clash of ideologies.
Robert Booth, assistant city
attorney for Palo Alto, explained the
Palo Alto ordinance against communal
and other types of group living. "One
of the primary things you try to do in a
city is to seperate kinds of uses of a
zone. You wouldn't want to have a
slaughter house next to a residence for
example," Booth said. "We try to
produce a certain number of people in
a zone so that we can plan for schools,
electricity, etc. Of course we wouldn't
ask some mother to kick out her five

children if the zone got too crowded,
but we do try to keep the number of
people in each zone under control."
Communes, Booth argues, do not
qualify as single-family residences and
overload city water and power
facilities.
Commune Raid
On November 30th, Booth's office
raided a Palo Alto commune on
Cowper Street and filed a complaint
against some members of the
commune, charging them with being in
violation of city zoning ordinances.
Booth's inspection was the first made
with a warrant and represents an
escalation of the City's hard-line policy
towards communes.
A second commune at 1001 Forest
Ave. was inspected by warrant
yesterday morning.
Three weeks ago, the Palo Alto
Human Relations Commission
recommended that the city not change
its ordinance concerning the limit of
unrelated people that can live together.
The reason for the decision according
to HRC member, John Zenger, is
"because the neighbors of communes
have problems that are greater in
number than regular
neighbors . . . There are communes
with too many dogs, too many
motorcycles coming in all night, and
rock music till two or three in the
morning."
Commune leaders in Palo Alto
disagree with the city's reasons for
trying to evict the communes from the
residential zones." It's a question of

commune argues. There are lots of
