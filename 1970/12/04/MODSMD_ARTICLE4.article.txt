# Lyman Offers Rebuttal To Carnegie Warning

### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Rising costs and a declining rate of
income has thrust Stanford and 1,5 00
other colleges and universities to the
brink of a "financial crisis unmatched
in its impact," the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education
reported Wednesday.
The report, compiled by former
Berkeley Vice Chancellor Earl P.Cheit,
warned that educational institutions
containing 7 7 percent of America's
campus population are near the point
of having to cut back important
services for lack of money.
President Richard W. Lyman, who
Monday announced a $4 million
expenditure cut over the next four
years, said the commission's report
failed to place Stanford's finances in
accurate perspective.
"We are more fortunate than many
institutions in having set aside funds
over the past 15 years for the rainy
days which are now upon us," said
Ly man.
"We have been frank in facing these
problems, and among the first to move
vigorously to meet them. As the Cheit
report says, classification of a college as
being 'in financial difficulty' in fact
could indicate that an institution is
doing relatively more than others to
maintain its quality while bringing its
income and expenditures into balance."

Lyman emphasized that Stanford's
budgetary adjustments would not
detract from the overall quality of
education and the judgement of faculty
and student advisors would be taken
into account.
"Contrary to the report's
implication, the overall size of the
Stanford faculty has not yet been
reduced. While more than 20 teaching
positions have been eliminated in
certain fields, an equivalent number has
been added elsewhere in the University.
During this period, the University's
total enrollment has remained stable."
But cutbacks elsewhere show that
the financial squeeze is being felt.
Library acquisitions have been cut anc'
general funds have been reallocated
from the Hoover Institute and the
business school. New programs in urban
and environmental studies are not being
funded and plans for library and law
school expansions, a drama program
and field trips have been "scrapped."
Tuition and fee charges, which have
about doubled in a decade, are nearing
a saturation point, in the view of many
administrators. Beyond that point,
middle-income students will be kept
out of college and only rich and the
subsidized poor will be able to attend.
The report indicated that
belt-tightening and review of priorities
bv the colleges and universities would
improve the situation but that
increased private giving and government
aid would be necessary to preserve
educational equality.
Private Support
Lyman concurred with this aspect of
the report, when he insisted that "the
challenge which now confronts all
higher education ... can be met only

through major, sustained increases in
private support; increased federal
assistance, especially at the graduate
level; and rigorous economics within
higher education itself."
The commission's findings indicated
that the state of the nation's economy,
which features a wave of inflation that
raises costs and inhibits income is the
overriding, but not the exclusive cause
of the current financial crisis.

The crisis involves as well questions
of public confidence in higher
education and of the future role and
purpose of colleges and universities.
The report cited campus
disturbances as another contributor to
financial difficulties of the nation's
educational institutions. Besides
providing an effective deterrent for
alumni fund-raising, campus unrest
imposes substantial costs for security,
insurance and replaced property.
Cutting Important Services
The commission chose 41
representative institutions on which to
base its broader conclusions, and
estimated that 54 0 schools, whose
enrollment constitutes 21 percent of
American college students already are
"in financial difficulty." These
institutions, including Stanford, have
been forced to curtail services they
consider important.
The report concluded that private
schools are more likely to face
difficulty than their public
counterparts. As of last spring, only 28
percent of the nation's private
institutions could be excluded from the
"financial difficulty" category Fifty
percent of the public colleges and
universities claimed the same
distinction.
The commission also disclosed that
liberal arts colleges are in better shape
than the nation's universities. Almost'
30 percent of the colleges had not yet
experienced financial difficulty, 81
percent of the universities had.

that the state of the nation's economy,
which features a wave of inflation that
raises costs and inhibits income is the
overriding, but not the exclusive cause
of the current financial crisis.

The crisis involves as well questions
of public confidence in higher
education and of the future role and
purpose of colleges and universities.
The report cited campus
disturbances as another contributor to
financial difficulties of the nation's
educational institutions. Besides
providing an effective deterrent for
alumni fund-raising, campus unrest
imposes substantial costs for security,
insurance and replaced property.
Cutting Important Services
The commission chose 41
representative institutions on which to
base its broader conclusions, and
estimated that 54 0 schools, whose
enrollment constitutes 21 percent of
American college students already are
"in financial difficulty." These
institutions, including Stanford, have
been forced to curtail services they
consider important.
The report concluded that private
schools are more likely to face
difficulty than their public
counterparts. As of last spring, only 28
percent of the nation's private
institutions could be excluded from the
"financial difficulty" category Fifty
percent of the public colleges and
universities claimed the same
distinction.
The commission also disclosed that
liberal arts colleges are in better shape
than the nation's universities. Almost'
30 percent of the colleges had not yet
experienced financial difficulty, 81
percent of the universities had.
Rising costs and a declining rate of
income has thrust Stanford and 1,5 00
other colleges and universities to the
brink of a "financial crisis unmatched
in its impact," the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education
reported Wednesday.
The report, compiled by former
Berkeley Vice Chancellor Earl P.Cheit,
warned that educational institutions
containing 7 7 percent of America's
campus population are near the point
of having to cut back important
services for lack of money.
President Richard W. Lyman, who
Monday announced a $4 million
expenditure cut over the next four
years, said the commission's report
failed to place Stanford's finances in
accurate perspective.
"We are more fortunate than many
institutions in having set aside funds
over the past 15 years for the rainy
days which are now upon us," said
Ly man.
"We have been frank in facing these
problems, and among the first to move
vigorously to meet them. As the Cheit
report says, classification of a college as
being 'in financial difficulty' in fact
could indicate that an institution is
doing relatively more than others to
maintain its quality while bringing its
income and expenditures into balance."

Lyman emphasized that Stanford's
budgetary adjustments would not
detract from the overall quality of
education and the judgement of faculty
and student advisors would be taken
into account.
"Contrary to the report's
implication, the overall size of the
Stanford faculty has not yet been
reduced. While more than 20 teaching
positions have been eliminated in
certain fields, an equivalent number has
been added elsewhere in the University.
During this period, the University's
total enrollment has remained stable."
But cutbacks elsewhere show that
the financial squeeze is being felt.
Library acquisitions have been cut anc'
general funds have been reallocated
from the Hoover Institute and the
business school. New programs in urban
and environmental studies are not being
funded and plans for library and law
school expansions, a drama program
and field trips have been "scrapped."
Tuition and fee charges, which have
about doubled in a decade, are nearing
a saturation point, in the view of many
administrators. Beyond that point,
middle-income students will be kept
out of college and only rich and the
subsidized poor will be able to attend.
The report indicated that
belt-tightening and review of priorities
bv the colleges and universities would
improve the situation but that
increased private giving and government
aid would be necessary to preserve
educational equality.
Private Support
Lyman concurred with this aspect of
the report, when he insisted that "the
challenge which now confronts all
higher education ... can be met only

through major, sustained increases in
private support; increased federal
assistance, especially at the graduate
level; and rigorous economics within
higher education itself."
