# Lyman Offers Rebuttal To Carnegie Warning

### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Rising costs and a declining rate of
income has thrust Stanford and 1,5 00
other colleges and universities to the
brink of a "financial crisis unmatched
in its impact," the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education
reported Wednesday.
The report, compiled by former
Berkeley Vice Chancellor Earl P.Cheit,
warned that educational institutions
containing 7 7 percent of America's
campus population are near the point
of having to cut back important
services for lack of money.
President Richard W. Lyman, who
Monday announced a $4 million
expenditure cut over the next four
years, said the commission's report
failed to place Stanford's finances in
accurate perspective.
"We are more fortunate than many
institutions in having set aside funds
over the past 15 years for the rainy
days which are now upon us," said
Ly man.
"We have been frank in facing these
problems, and among the first to move
vigorously to meet them. As the Cheit
report says, classification of a college as
being 'in financial difficulty' in fact
could indicate that an institution is
doing relatively more than others to
maintain its quality while bringing its
income and expenditures into balance."

Lyman emphasized that Stanford's
budgetary adjustments would not
detract from the overall quality of
education and the judgement of faculty
and student advisors would be taken
into account.
"Contrary to the report's
implication, the overall size of the
Stanford faculty has not yet been
reduced. While more than 20 teaching
positions have been eliminated in
certain fields, an equivalent number has
been added elsewhere in the University.
During this period, the University's
total enrollment has remained stable."
But cutbacks elsewhere show that
the financial squeeze is being felt.
Library acquisitions have been cut anc'
general funds have been reallocated
from the Hoover Institute and the
business school. New programs in urban
and environmental studies are not being
funded and plans for library and law
school expansions, a drama program
and field trips have been "scrapped."
Tuition and fee charges, which have
about doubled in a decade, are nearing
a saturation point, in the view of many
administrators. Beyond that point,
middle-income students will be kept
out of college and only rich and the
subsidized poor will be able to attend.
The report indicated that
belt-tightening and review of priorities
bv the colleges and universities would
