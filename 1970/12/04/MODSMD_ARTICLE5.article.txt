Hanoi Raid
Editor, THE DAILY:
ITie U.S. raid near Hanoi is not
without precedent. For example,
during the closing days of the
Second World War, numerous
raids were made to liberate
prisoners in Germany. A company
of Paratroopers was dropped on a
Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in
the Philippines to save a large
group of American civilians from
execution. The whole country
applauded. There were
international sighs of relief when
Belgian paratroopers flew from a
great distance at the last minute
to save the lives of 500 whites in
the Republic of the Congo.
This country attempts to save
some of its service men from the
horrible conditions in a North
Vietnamese jail, and the irrational
response of the local radicals is
more childish vandalism. I wonder
how some of these ignorant young
members of the lunatic fringe
would have reacted if their
brother or father had been the
object of the rescue operation.

SEL
Land Use Plans
Editor, THE DAILY:
Contrary to the implications
in Thursday's front page Daily

story, we clearly anticipate
that members of the campus
community, as well as
representatives of neighboring
jurisdictions, will have an
opportunity to express their
views prior to adoption of
overall land use plans and
policies by the Board of
Trustees.
At their meeting Monday,
the Trustee Committee on
Land Development simply
approved the general direction
of the alternative
recommendations now being
developed by Livingston and
Blayney.
They also requested that the
consultant's written
recommendations be prepared
for review by this committee in
February.
After these are reported to
the Board, they will serve as
the basis for discussion within
Stanford and nearby
communities prior to the
Board's adoption of overall
land use plans and policies.
Throughout the initial
phases of his study, Mr.
Livingston has sought counsel
from faculty and student
members of both the Trustee
Committee on Land
Development and the
University Committee on Land
and Building Development,
which includes staff members.
He also attended a campus

hearing on this subject last
spring, and his consulted with
official representatives of both
counties and of all surrounding
cities, in the course of his
present study.

Women Ph.D.'s
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to Dean Moses'
statements in the article on the
declining percentage of
graduate student women,l
would like to point out that
there are studies on the work
records of women receiving
Ph.D.'s. Helen Astin, in The
Woman Doctorate in America,
states that more than 90% of
the women granted doctorates
in 1 957-1958 were employed
in 1964, and 79% of them had
not interrupted their careers
during that time. It is also
notable that other studies

suggest that 1) married women
Ph.D.'s employed full time
publish more than men Ph.D.
and 2) women doctorate
holders have more academic
ability than their male
counterparts (not surprisingly,
since they are more stringently
selected).
The argument that women
don't use their degrees or don't
stay long enough to get them is
only partially true, but it
provides the university with a
good excuse to continue the
status quo. The best way to
ensure that women use
opportunities for graduate
work is to admit more, rather
than fewer of them. If there
are more qualified women in
the work pool, more of them
will get jobs, meaning that
more of them will have a
chance to show what they can
accomplish. As conditions
stand, women with Ph.D.'s are
rare enough in many fields that
departments can act as if hiring

a woman at a low salary for a
heavy teaching load were an
act of generosity.
What is needed at this point
is not a reduction in
opportunity, but an increase. If
Stanford can recognize that it
has responsibilities to black,
Chicano and Indian students,
why does it ignore its
responsibilities to women?

Pretty Humorous
Editor, THE DAILY:
It strikes me as being pretty
humorous that Bill Evers and
Leonard Siegel are telling the
University how to utilize its
facilities in their letter to the
Editor when neither of them is
a registered student.

Synanon 'Best 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
Marshall Kilduff's recent
article on methadone programs
was very misleading in its
statements by the author and
Dr. Avram Goldstein that such
programs are the most
promising effort yet devised
for solving the problem of
heroin addiction, and "seem to
be the only program that is
effective at all". It is true that
methadone allows many drug
addicts to lead more
productive lives without
criminal activity; in a way, it
solves the social problem of
drug addiction by converting
the user of a dangerous,
expensive, illegal, injected drug
into a user of a safe, cheap,
legal, oral drug with less high
and lows. But the methadone
user is still a drug addict. In
that sense the methadone
program is totally ineffective.
The best program is that of
Synanon, and to a lesser
degree, similar programs at the
"Daytop" in New York and
the "Family" in Mendocino in
which former drug addicts not
only do not use any drugs at all
but learn to live with
themselves and others with
love, honesty, responsibility,
joby, self-reliance, and the
self-respect of a drug-free life.

There are about 1500 residents
in Synanon living such lives at
this time, and Synanon has
only just concluded its first
decade. About 500 of these
residents relate to Synanon's
facility at 1215 Clay Street,
Oakland.
Synanon should be
foremost among the
alternatives offered for the true
rehabilitation of drug addicts,
but the addict must be
motivated to accept their full
residential program.
