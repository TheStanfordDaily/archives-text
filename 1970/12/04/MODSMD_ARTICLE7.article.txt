# Russian Response Awaited
## Pessimistic Outlook For SALT 
### DON LINDEMANN 
U.S. and Soviet delegates have
been meeting for more than a year
now, but the mood in Helsinki —
site of the third round of the
Strategic Arms Limitation Talks
(SALT)—is apparently chillier
than the weather. Little optimism
is expressed for an early
breakthrough in negotiations. U.S.
U.S. officials in the Finnish
capital are waiting for a reaction
from the Soviets on the American
plan presented in July at the
second round of talks in Vienna.
That proposal, called the "Vienna
Plan," calls for a mutual ceiling on
the number of strategic missiles.
The Americans would like to add
a qualitative feature to this by
limiting the number of Russia's
powerful SS-9 missiles.
The other basic aspect of the
Vienna Plan is a limitation on
anti-ballistic systems at fewer than
100 missiles.
The Soviet Union apparently
has not responded to the proposal,
despite the pressuring of U.S.
delegates, who are rather reticent
about the substance of
negotiations.
According to Peter Paret,
history professor, "Things do not
seem as bright as they did six
months ago." He said it is hard to
say why the view is dim, since so
many factors are involved and we
cannot know exactly what the
Russian reaction is to particular
actions of the U.S. in world
affairs.
Important Developments
Nevertheless, several important
developments over the past year
are not considered encouraging in

respect to the arms limitation
talks.
First, both sides have gone on
to deploy or test MIRV'S
(multiple independently targeted
reentry vehicles). Also, the U.S.
has moved into the second stage
of its Safeguard anti-ballistic
missile system.
Meanwhile, the Soviets have
built a fleet of SS-9's. The
Russians also have gained on the
Americans in Polaris-type
submarines. They now have 30,
compared to 41 for the U.S.

News Analysis

These developments and others
seem to destroy any optimism for
some sort of arms-limitation
agreement. But officials are not
totally pessimistic.
Prof. Ehrlich of the Law
School, feels that the first
agreement made in Helsinki need
not be a major treaty requiring
Senate ratification.
"Although the first agreement
may be modest, there will
hopefully be further agreements,"
said Ehrlich. He added that the
trend toward MIRV's and ABM's
might be reversed if on-going talks
were held.
One of the purposes of the
negotiations, as Paret pointed out,
is to make further retaliatory
systems unnecessary. But there is
considerable doubt whether
system build-ups are necessary
anyway.
"Great Mistake"
Paret maintained that "it's a
great mistake to set a certain level

(of weapons) and say this is
enough. Ehrlich, however, did not
see the need for further missile
development. "We don't need to
develop a new parity before we
can reach an agreement," he said.
"I find it hard to accept the
notion that continued testing will
make an agreement easier .. . It's
nonsense,. .. frightening, serious
nonsense."
John Barton, another law
professor, said that maintaining a
nuclear balance is of "marginal
difference" strategically, although
he said there is some diplomatic
value.
Russian Missiles
A year ago, when the first
round of talks began, the Russians
were estimated to have 1,350
land-based ICSM's and about 200
missiles aboard submarines. Now
the totals are estimated at more
than 1 ,4 00 ICBM's and 450
missiles on submarines. This
compares with 1,054 and 656 for
the U.S.
Laird believes that an
acceptable arms-control
agreement would preserve the
nuclear balance. He has said that
we cannot afford an interminable
wait for such an agreement.
In opposition to this view is
that of political-economist
Gunnar Myrdal, influential
chairman of the Stockholm
International Peace Research
Institute.
The crux of Myrdal's agrument
is that nuclear superiority is
unimportant. He writes: "The
balance of terror is not delicate:
quite substantial changes in the
numbers of warheads on one side

The monstrous complexity oi
the nuclear arms race seems to be
the most compelling reason for
establishing controls. As Barton
said, even a wealth of comparative
data can be misleading. "You just
aren't able to make the same
precise calculations of deterrents
as you did five years ago."
