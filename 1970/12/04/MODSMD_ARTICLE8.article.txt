# Are You The Finger-Dinger Man?
## 
### JON DEDMON PAUL GRUSHKIN 
"Match up the clunked glunks and be the winning glunkclunker! For
two to four players, ages five to adult."
"Clunk a Glunk" is this year's sleeper in Christmas games. But it is
only one of a thousand pieces of evidence that Santa and his
toymaking elves at the North Pole have finally lost it.
Take a trip to Norney's Toy Store, a real honest-to-goodness trip.
Stand there totally wrecked and freak out on this year's crop of
potential and not so potential Christmas gifts.
But beware! Little old ladies may try to hassle you!
Try out the "Bang Box Game" on your niece, or even on your
elbows. You can even sing the riddle, "When you hammer the nail,
some care you must use, or the box will go BANG! and that way you
lose."
Or how about "Time Bomb." The game is simple: "1) Wind It, 2)
Toss It, 3) Catch It, 4) And You're Stuck With It ... HA HA HA HA
HA HA."
You can try your hand, so to speak, at "Big Thumb." ("Big Thumb
grabs the chip at last, hammer WHOPS HIM, stops him fast.")
Probably if you're handy at "Big Thumb," you'll cut the mustard
with "Finger Dinger Man." Exhort your Dad, "Be a Super Duper
Finger Dinger Man."
If you're hungry for something more meaty, try Norney's "Phoney
Baloney" puzzle ("no refrigeration necessary"). You'll find it
sandwiched in between "Squirmy Wormy," and"The Woody
Woodpecker Up The Tree Game."
Are you in the mood for a quiet game, lady? (Heh, heh, heh, heh.)
There's the old parlor room favorite, "The Seduction Game."
Much simpler than monopoly, where you have to beat everybody on

the board, in this game you only try to screw the person on your left.
It's billed as a "new variation on the old game." It says so on the
cover, so follow the rules instinctively.
Other minority games include one for guilty liberals, called "Blacks
and Whites," the role identity and neighborhood game. The
instructions on the box urge you to "experience the ghetto, live on
welfare, and try and buy into a white suburb." The statement
concludes, "That's why you'll find along about the middle of the
game—if the black players turn the tide against white advantages—a
kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board."
Just about this time, when you're just beginning to discover
"Ker-Plunk," and the "Fang Bang Game," you're going to hear a little
old saleslady say, "So long as they keep everything in the boxes, I
guess it's OK." If that happens, just tell her you're from the Stanford
Daily and writing a sequel to the Christmas toy story. She'll
understand ... or throw you out.
Tired of merely polluting your mind? Try polluting your
opponent. Funnel your industrial wastes into your opponents'
ecosystems. It's all in the game called "Dirty Water." Do you ever
wonder what the Ehrlich girl gets for Christmas?
Speaking of birth control, give your dolly Norney's special birth
control pills. You don't take them before, you don't take them after.
You take them instead. Give your sister "Bottoms Up," one of whose
commands is to "obey the request of any player on your right."
As we passed the "Junior Zither" and the "Bath House Brass
Fluglehorn" a giant panda bear leapt out and menacingly extended his
paw. "Who are you?" we asked. After a pause, he lowered his paws,
and said, "I'm just like Santa but with claws."
There's a lot more at Norney's, but we just couldn't handle it.
P.S. Julie says to buy the dolly with the hair that actually grows
down below her waist. It does, honest!

Baloney" puzzle ("no refrigeration necessary"). You'll find it
sandwiched in between "Squirmy Wormy," and"The Woody
Woodpecker Up The Tree Game."
Are you in the mood for a quiet game, lady? (Heh, heh, heh, heh.)
There's the old parlor room favorite, "The Seduction Game."
Much simpler than monopoly, where you have to beat everybody on

the board, in this game you only try to screw the person on your left.
It's billed as a "new variation on the old game." It says so on the
cover, so follow the rules instinctively.
Other minority games include one for guilty liberals, called "Blacks
and Whites," the role identity and neighborhood game. The
instructions on the box urge you to "experience the ghetto, live on
welfare, and try and buy into a white suburb." The statement
concludes, "That's why you'll find along about the middle of the
game—if the black players turn the tide against white advantages—a
kind of irrepressible excitement takes over the board."
Just about this time, when you're just beginning to discover
"Ker-Plunk," and the "Fang Bang Game," you're going to hear a little
old saleslady say, "So long as they keep everything in the boxes, I
guess it's OK." If that happens, just tell her you're from the Stanford
Daily and writing a sequel to the Christmas toy story. She'll
understand ... or throw you out.
Tired of merely polluting your mind? Try polluting your
opponent. Funnel your industrial wastes into your opponents'
ecosystems. It's all in the game called "Dirty Water." Do you ever
wonder what the Ehrlich girl gets for Christmas?
Speaking of birth control, give your dolly Norney's special birth
control pills. You don't take them before, you don't take them after.
You take them instead. Give your sister "Bottoms Up," one of whose
commands is to "obey the request of any player on your right."
As we passed the "Junior Zither" and the "Bath House Brass
Fluglehorn" a giant panda bear leapt out and menacingly extended his
paw. "Who are you?" we asked. After a pause, he lowered his paws,
and said, "I'm just like Santa but with claws."
There's a lot more at Norney's, but we just couldn't handle it.
P.S. Julie says to buy the dolly with the hair that actually grows
down below her waist. It does, honest!
"Match up the clunked glunks and be the winning glunkclunker! For
two to four players, ages five to adult."
"Clunk a Glunk" is this year's sleeper in Christmas games. But it is
only one of a thousand pieces of evidence that Santa and his
toymaking elves at the North Pole have finally lost it.
Take a trip to Norney's Toy Store, a real honest-to-goodness trip.
Stand there totally wrecked and freak out on this year's crop of
potential and not so potential Christmas gifts.
But beware! Little old ladies may try to hassle you!
Try out the "Bang Box Game" on your niece, or even on your
elbows. You can even sing the riddle, "When you hammer the nail,
some care you must use, or the box will go BANG! and that way you
lose."
Or how about "Time Bomb." The game is simple: "1) Wind It, 2)
Toss It, 3) Catch It, 4) And You're Stuck With It ... HA HA HA HA
HA HA."
You can try your hand, so to speak, at "Big Thumb." ("Big Thumb
grabs the chip at last, hammer WHOPS HIM, stops him fast.")
Probably if you're handy at "Big Thumb," you'll cut the mustard
with "Finger Dinger Man." Exhort your Dad, "Be a Super Duper
Finger Dinger Man."
If you're hungry for something more meaty, try Norney's "Phoney
Baloney" puzzle ("no refrigeration necessary"). You'll find it
sandwiched in between "Squirmy Wormy," and"The Woody
Woodpecker Up The Tree Game."
