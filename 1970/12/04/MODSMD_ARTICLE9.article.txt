# Scorpion And Frog
## 
### CAROL LEWIS 
A scorpion, meeting a frog
about to swim across the Nile
River, asked the frog if he might
ride along on the frog's back. Said
*the frog: "No. You and I are
enemies, and riding on my back,
you could easily sting me.
"But, I need you to reach the
other side, " replied the scorpion,
"and if I stung you then 1 too
'ivould drown." Considering the
fogic of the argument, the frog
\greed to transport the scorpion
across the Nile River.
Nevertheless, halfway across,
the scorpion stung the frog.
"Why?" demanded the frog as
both he and the scorpion were
sinking. The scorpion answered
"This, my friend, is the Middle
East. "
With a second 90-day truce
underway, the world continues to
hope for the reinstatement of the
Jarring Peace Talks, and a
peaceful solution to the Middle

East Crisis. Both Washington and
Moscow, despite their respective
alliances with Israel and Egypt,
seek to avoid a major war in the
Middle East.
Observers agree that the Arab
states need a period of tranquility
to settle their own internal
problems. From the fourth
member of the Jarring Talks,
Israel, comes news that hawkish
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is

publicly advocating Israel's return
to the peace table.
Nevertheless, there is no
promise that definitive peace talks
will occur. In the Middle East,
where problems are deep-rooted
and comple face-value acceptance
of public differences are often
misleading. David Axelrad of the
Jewish Student Union on campus
remarked "Everybody knows that
Israeli moves towards peace table
are just for the public". Howard
Koch and Michel Nabti, two Hoov
er Institute staff members and
specialists in Middle East Affairs,
hold similiar interpretations of
Israeli statements.
Negligible Worth
More important, the actual
worth of the peace talks remains
negligible in many minds. "There
may be peace talks," stated
Lebanese Michel Nabti, assistant
curator for the Middle East
collection in the Hoover Library,
"but I personally believe there

revolves around the unavoidable
reality of two peoples, Israelis and
Palestinians, who each claim the
right of determination for one
piece of land.
However Koch, research
associate at Hoover, feels that
various peace plans represent
"semantic games." The Big
Powers "cannot face up to the
true dilemna. the ultimate fate of
two conflicting national entities,
Israel and Palestine."
Catering To Peace Talks
Peace talks, at the present
time, cater to the formal Arab
governments, Israel, Russia and
the U.S. Palestine, as an national
entity is not recognized by the
state of Israel, a fact, which alone
nullifies the value of the peace
talks for many Arabs and
certainly the Palestinians.
The Palestinians, people who
were forced to leave their
homeland in the 1 948 war and
were further displaced by the
June War of 1 967, to live in
refugee camps, have exhibited
their refusal to accept passively
the state of Israel and all plans for
negotiations with Israel. In spite
of or perhaps because of human
degradation which defined life in
refugee camps, a Palestinian
consciousness has developed in
the Palestinian Liberation Front.
The Front, whose ultimate
objective is to regain the
Palestinian homeland, "probably
has no direct parallels" remarked
Koch. Since the June War this
movement has gained momentum

won't be much positive result.
Peace talks are not the first
issue . . . Everybody wants
'peace'.. . but we must look at
the ingredients of the situation
and then ask what prospects are
offered."
What are the ingredients of the
situation? Sulzberger of the New
York Times maintains "the real
forces in the Middle East today
are Russia, America, Egypt and
Israel." The problem, however.

in the Arab world and consequent
validity in the political scene.
'The New Jews'
"They are calling their own
show, styling themselves the "New
Jews," he added, referring to the
passion and determination of
Palestinian guerillas.
Jewish student David Axelrad,
referring to conversations with the
San Francisco Examiner's Israeli
analyst Norbert Yaisharoff
maintains that Israel is nearing the
point where "Palestine state must
be recognized."
However, it continues to be the
legal Arab governments which
have the power and formal
authority to negotiate on areas of
conflict which effect the
Palestinian people. Because these
states do not accept the "retrieval
of Palestinian national homeland"
as their first priority, a second
Middle East conflict exists; a
conflict between the Palestinian
Liberation Front and certain Arab
governments.
Arab Governments
Nabti describes the Arab
governments' response to the
commandos as "definitely
negative." Syria, which has
historically been a mainstay of the
Palestinian guerilla movement can
no longer be depended upon by
the Front. The recent coup which
placed Lieutenant General
al-Assad in power appears much
more amenable to negotiated
settlement than the previous
regime.
In Jordon, where antagonisms

have existed between the
Hashemite government and the
Palestinians since the creation of
the state, the degree of conflict
was tragically displayed in the
September fighting in Amman.
Axelrad believes that had the
guerillas actually overthrown the
Hashemite regime, Israel would
have rushed support to King
Hussein's army.
Unilateral Peace Treaty
Mentioning a recent secret
meeting between Hussein and
Israeli Deputy Premier, Yigael
Allon, Axelrad concludes "Israel
will conclude a unilateral peace
treaty with Jordon."
Hussein's motivation for such a
treaty might be his fears that an
Israeli-Egyptian settlement would
ignore Jordon's demands for
return of East Jeruselum and the
West Bank from Israel.
Termed reactionary by
Palestinian and Egyptian
spokemen alike, Jordon's position
in the Middle East has always
been delicate matter. Various
alliances with Arab nations and
the now implicit collusion with
Israel derived from the secret
meetings (which Israel now
denies) create a precarious
position for pro-American
Hussein.
Koch maintains that "Jordon
as a state will sooner or later cease
to exist. A European construction
to meet now antiquarian needs has
no real reason for existence as a
separate political entity," he
explained.

One of the most recent events
among other Arab nations is the
agreement between Libya, Egypt,
the Sudan and now Syria to plan
for an Arab federation. The
merging and subsequent balancing
of Libya's wealth and Egypt's
overwhelming population might
prove advantageous for the entire
Arab world. Observers agree
however, that for federation to
remain viable, in an ever-changing
Arab World, it would necessarily
be loose.
The implications of possible
federation for the Middle East on
the current Arab-Israeli dilemma
remains unclear. Nabti feels that it
is "better for Arab governments
to be dealt with as one strong
power rather than several small
nations." Whether or not that one
strong federation would use its
power to surpress the Palestinian
commandos or whether it would
find strength to face Israeli in war
cannot be determined now. "It

The guerillas 4 are calling their
own show 9 styling themselves the
6 'New Jews 9 ... 9

can be viewed from both sides"
states Nabti.
The federation, like most
Middle East phenomena now
serves to increase the
permutations of conflict in the
Middle East, a fact which makes
one final solution so very difficult
to find.
Impossible To Tell
If peace talks occur it is
impossible to determine what

concessions will be made. Cairo's
position continues to be the
return of all territory occupied by
Israel in the 1967 war. Koch views
Israeli development projects in
this territory as "hardly an
indication that Israel intends to
return the land in its entirety."
Meanwhile the Palestinian
question looms heavily in the
background • or perhaps
foreground • of any impending
negotiated settlement. Expressing
the views of many Jewish Student
Union members here, Jane Rubin
states that "establishment of two
individual and seperate states for
Israelis and Palestinians is the only
answer." This, however is
anathema to everything the
Palestinians believe. For
Palestinians, the Zionist state of
Israel must be replaced by a
"secular, bi-national, democratic
state of Palestine." That this state
would be truly democratic or
bi-national is considered

"Palestinian rhetoric" by Jewish
community.
It appears that the fear and
doubt involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, coupled with the
militancy of Jews and Palestinians
make the possibility for peaceful
solution remote. In fact, the very
tragedy in the Middle East may be
inherent in what Koch terms the
"dynamic of the conflict: the
inability of anyone to disengage
himself."

In Jordon, where antagonisms

have existed between the
Hashemite government and the
Palestinians since the creation of
the state, the degree of conflict
was tragically displayed in the
September fighting in Amman.
Axelrad believes that had the
guerillas actually overthrown the
Hashemite regime, Israel would
have rushed support to King
Hussein's army.
Unilateral Peace Treaty
Mentioning a recent secret
meeting between Hussein and
Israeli Deputy Premier, Yigael
Allon, Axelrad concludes "Israel
will conclude a unilateral peace
treaty with Jordon."
Hussein's motivation for such a
treaty might be his fears that an
Israeli-Egyptian settlement would
ignore Jordon's demands for
return of East Jeruselum and the
West Bank from Israel.
Termed reactionary by
Palestinian and Egyptian
spokemen alike, Jordon's position
in the Middle East has always
been delicate matter. Various
alliances with Arab nations and
the now implicit collusion with
Israel derived from the secret
meetings (which Israel now
denies) create a precarious
position for pro-American
Hussein.
Koch maintains that "Jordon
as a state will sooner or later cease
to exist. A European construction
to meet now antiquarian needs has
no real reason for existence as a
separate political entity," he
explained.

One of the most recent events
among other Arab nations is the
agreement between Libya, Egypt,
the Sudan and now Syria to plan
for an Arab federation. The
merging and subsequent balancing
of Libya's wealth and Egypt's
overwhelming population might
prove advantageous for the entire
Arab world. Observers agree
however, that for federation to
remain viable, in an ever-changing
Arab World, it would necessarily
be loose.
The implications of possible
federation for the Middle East on
the current Arab-Israeli dilemma
remains unclear. Nabti feels that it
is "better for Arab governments
to be dealt with as one strong
power rather than several small
nations." Whether or not that one
strong federation would use its
power to surpress the Palestinian
commandos or whether it would
find strength to face Israeli in war
cannot be determined now. "It

can be viewed from both sides"
states Nabti.
The federation, like most
Middle East phenomena now
serves to increase the
permutations of conflict in the
Middle East, a fact which makes
one final solution so very difficult
to find.
Impossible To Tell
If peace talks occur it is
impossible to determine what

concessions will be made. Cairo's
position continues to be the
return of all territory occupied by
Israel in the 1967 war. Koch views
Israeli development projects in
this territory as "hardly an
indication that Israel intends to
return the land in its entirety."
Meanwhile the Palestinian
question looms heavily in the
background • or perhaps
foreground • of any impending
negotiated settlement. Expressing
the views of many Jewish Student
Union members here, Jane Rubin
states that "establishment of two
individual and seperate states for
Israelis and Palestinians is the only
answer." This, however is
anathema to everything the
Palestinians believe. For
Palestinians, the Zionist state of
Israel must be replaced by a
"secular, bi-national, democratic
state of Palestine." That this state
would be truly democratic or
bi-national is considered

"Palestinian rhetoric" by Jewish
community.
It appears that the fear and
doubt involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, coupled with the
militancy of Jews and Palestinians
make the possibility for peaceful
solution remote. In fact, the very
tragedy in the Middle East may be
inherent in what Koch terms the
"dynamic of the conflict: the
inability of anyone to disengage
himself."
A scorpion, meeting a frog
about to swim across the Nile
River, asked the frog if he might

"But, I need you to reach the

Nevertheless, halfway across,

East Crisis. Both Washington and
Moscow, despite their respective
alliances with Israel and Egypt,
seek to avoid a major war in the
Middle East.
Observers agree that the Arab
states need a period of tranquility
to settle their own internal
problems. From the fourth
member of the Jarring Talks,
Israel, comes news that hawkish
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is

publicly advocating Israel's return
to the peace table.
Nevertheless, there is no
promise that definitive peace talks
will occur. In the Middle East,
where problems are deep-rooted
and comple face-value acceptance
of public differences are often
misleading. David Axelrad of the
Jewish Student Union on campus
remarked "Everybody knows that
Israeli moves towards peace table
are just for the public". Howard
Koch and Michel Nabti, two Hoov
er Institute staff members and
specialists in Middle East Affairs,
hold similiar interpretations of
Israeli statements.
Negligible Worth
More important, the actual
worth of the peace talks remains
negligible in many minds. "There
may be peace talks," stated
Lebanese Michel Nabti, assistant
curator for the Middle East
collection in the Hoover Library,
"but I personally believe there

revolves around the unavoidable
reality of two peoples, Israelis and
Palestinians, who each claim the

However Koch, research
associate at Hoover, feels that
various peace plans represent
"semantic games." The Big
Powers "cannot face up to the
true dilemna. the ultimate fate of
two conflicting national entities,
Israel and Palestine."
Catering To Peace Talks
Peace talks, at the present
time, cater to the formal Arab
governments, Israel, Russia and
the U.S. Palestine, as an national
entity is not recognized by the
state of Israel, a fact, which alone
nullifies the value of the peace
talks for many Arabs and
certainly the Palestinians.
The Palestinians, people who
were forced to leave their
homeland in the 1 948 war and
were further displaced by the
June War of 1 967, to live in
refugee camps, have exhibited
their refusal to accept passively
the state of Israel and all plans for
negotiations with Israel. In spite
of or perhaps because of human
degradation which defined life in
refugee camps, a Palestinian
consciousness has developed in
the Palestinian Liberation Front.
The Front, whose ultimate
objective is to regain the
Palestinian homeland, "probably
has no direct parallels" remarked
Koch. Since the June War this
movement has gained momentum

"They are calling their own

passion and determination of
Palestinian guerillas.
Jewish student David Axelrad,
referring to conversations with the
San Francisco Examiner's Israeli
analyst Norbert Yaisharoff
maintains that Israel is nearing the
point where "Palestine state must
be recognized."
However, it continues to be the
legal Arab governments which
have the power and formal
authority to negotiate on areas of
conflict which effect the
Palestinian people. Because these
states do not accept the "retrieval
of Palestinian national homeland"
as their first priority, a second
Middle East conflict exists; a
conflict between the Palestinian
Liberation Front and certain Arab
governments.
Arab Governments
Nabti describes the Arab
governments' response to the
commandos as "definitely
negative." Syria, which has
historically been a mainstay of the
Palestinian guerilla movement can
no longer be depended upon by
the Front. The recent coup which
placed Lieutenant General
al-Assad in power appears much
more amenable to negotiated
settlement than the previous
regime.

Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is

publicly advocating Israel's return
to the peace table.
Nevertheless, there is no
promise that definitive peace talks
will occur. In the Middle East,
where problems are deep-rooted
and comple face-value acceptance
of public differences are often
misleading. David Axelrad of the
Jewish Student Union on campus
remarked "Everybody knows that
Israeli moves towards peace table
are just for the public". Howard
Koch and Michel Nabti, two Hoov
er Institute staff members and
specialists in Middle East Affairs,
hold similiar interpretations of
Israeli statements.
Negligible Worth
More important, the actual
worth of the peace talks remains
negligible in many minds. "There
may be peace talks," stated
Lebanese Michel Nabti, assistant
curator for the Middle East
collection in the Hoover Library,
"but I personally believe there

revolves around the unavoidable
reality of two peoples, Israelis and
Palestinians, who each claim the
right of determination for one
piece of land.
However Koch, research
associate at Hoover, feels that
various peace plans represent
"semantic games." The Big
Powers "cannot face up to the
true dilemna. the ultimate fate of
two conflicting national entities,
Israel and Palestine."
Catering To Peace Talks
Peace talks, at the present
time, cater to the formal Arab
governments, Israel, Russia and
the U.S. Palestine, as an national
entity is not recognized by the
state of Israel, a fact, which alone
nullifies the value of the peace
talks for many Arabs and
certainly the Palestinians.
The Palestinians, people who
were forced to leave their
homeland in the 1 948 war and
were further displaced by the
June War of 1 967, to live in
refugee camps, have exhibited
their refusal to accept passively
the state of Israel and all plans for
negotiations with Israel. In spite
of or perhaps because of human
degradation which defined life in
refugee camps, a Palestinian
consciousness has developed in
the Palestinian Liberation Front.
The Front, whose ultimate
objective is to regain the
Palestinian homeland, "probably
has no direct parallels" remarked
Koch. Since the June War this
movement has gained momentum

What are the ingredients of the
situation? Sulzberger of the New

forces in the Middle East today
are Russia, America, Egypt and
Israel." The problem, however.

in the Arab world and consequent
validity in the political scene.
'The New Jews'
"They are calling their own
show, styling themselves the "New
Jews," he added, referring to the
passion and determination of
Palestinian guerillas.
Jewish student David Axelrad,
referring to conversations with the
San Francisco Examiner's Israeli
analyst Norbert Yaisharoff
maintains that Israel is nearing the
point where "Palestine state must
be recognized."
However, it continues to be the
legal Arab governments which
have the power and formal
authority to negotiate on areas of
conflict which effect the
Palestinian people. Because these
states do not accept the "retrieval
of Palestinian national homeland"
as their first priority, a second
Middle East conflict exists; a
conflict between the Palestinian
Liberation Front and certain Arab
governments.
Arab Governments
Nabti describes the Arab
governments' response to the
commandos as "definitely
negative." Syria, which has
historically been a mainstay of the
Palestinian guerilla movement can
no longer be depended upon by
the Front. The recent coup which
placed Lieutenant General
al-Assad in power appears much
more amenable to negotiated
settlement than the previous
regime.
In Jordon, where antagonisms

have existed between the
Hashemite government and the
Palestinians since the creation of
the state, the degree of conflict
was tragically displayed in the
September fighting in Amman.
Axelrad believes that had the
guerillas actually overthrown the
Hashemite regime, Israel would
have rushed support to King
Hussein's army.
Unilateral Peace Treaty
Mentioning a recent secret
meeting between Hussein and
Israeli Deputy Premier, Yigael
Allon, Axelrad concludes "Israel
will conclude a unilateral peace
treaty with Jordon."
Hussein's motivation for such a
treaty might be his fears that an
Israeli-Egyptian settlement would
ignore Jordon's demands for
return of East Jeruselum and the
West Bank from Israel.
Termed reactionary by
Palestinian and Egyptian
spokemen alike, Jordon's position
in the Middle East has always
been delicate matter. Various
alliances with Arab nations and
the now implicit collusion with
Israel derived from the secret
meetings (which Israel now
denies) create a precarious
position for pro-American
Hussein.
Koch maintains that "Jordon
as a state will sooner or later cease
to exist. A European construction
to meet now antiquarian needs has
no real reason for existence as a
separate political entity," he
explained.

One of the most recent events
among other Arab nations is the
agreement between Libya, Egypt,
the Sudan and now Syria to plan
for an Arab federation. The
merging and subsequent balancing
of Libya's wealth and Egypt's
overwhelming population might
prove advantageous for the entire
Arab world. Observers agree
however, that for federation to
remain viable, in an ever-changing
Arab World, it would necessarily
be loose.
The implications of possible
federation for the Middle East on
the current Arab-Israeli dilemma
remains unclear. Nabti feels that it
is "better for Arab governments
to be dealt with as one strong
power rather than several small
nations." Whether or not that one
strong federation would use its
power to surpress the Palestinian
commandos or whether it would
find strength to face Israeli in war
cannot be determined now. "It

The guerillas 4 are calling their
own show 9 styling themselves the
6 'New Jews 9 ... 9

can be viewed from both sides"
states Nabti.
The federation, like most
Middle East phenomena now
serves to increase the
permutations of conflict in the
Middle East, a fact which makes
one final solution so very difficult
to find.
Impossible To Tell
If peace talks occur it is
impossible to determine what

concessions will be made. Cairo's
position continues to be the
return of all territory occupied by
Israel in the 1967 war. Koch views
Israeli development projects in
this territory as "hardly an
indication that Israel intends to
return the land in its entirety."
Meanwhile the Palestinian
question looms heavily in the
background • or perhaps
foreground • of any impending
negotiated settlement. Expressing
the views of many Jewish Student
Union members here, Jane Rubin
states that "establishment of two
individual and seperate states for
Israelis and Palestinians is the only
answer." This, however is
anathema to everything the
Palestinians believe. For
Palestinians, the Zionist state of
Israel must be replaced by a
"secular, bi-national, democratic
state of Palestine." That this state
would be truly democratic or
bi-national is considered

"Palestinian rhetoric" by Jewish
community.
It appears that the fear and
doubt involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, coupled with the
militancy of Jews and Palestinians
make the possibility for peaceful
solution remote. In fact, the very
tragedy in the Middle East may be
inherent in what Koch terms the
"dynamic of the conflict: the
inability of anyone to disengage
himself."
A scorpion, meeting a frog
about to swim across the Nile
River, asked the frog if he might
ride along on the frog's back. Said
*the frog: "No. You and I are
enemies, and riding on my back,

"But, I need you to reach the
other side, " replied the scorpion,
"and if I stung you then 1 too

fogic of the argument, the frog

Nevertheless, halfway across,
the scorpion stung the frog.
"Why?" demanded the frog as

sinking. The scorpion answered

agreement between Libya, Egypt,
the Sudan and now Syria to plan
for an Arab federation. The
merging and subsequent balancing
of Libya's wealth and Egypt's
overwhelming population might
prove advantageous for the entire
Arab world. Observers agree
however, that for federation to
remain viable, in an ever-changing
Arab World, it would necessarily
be loose.
The implications of possible
federation for the Middle East on
the current Arab-Israeli dilemma
remains unclear. Nabti feels that it
is "better for Arab governments
to be dealt with as one strong
power rather than several small
nations." Whether or not that one
strong federation would use its
power to surpress the Palestinian
commandos or whether it would
find strength to face Israeli in war
cannot be determined now. "It

states Nabti.
The federation, like most
Middle East phenomena now
serves to increase the
permutations of conflict in the
Middle East, a fact which makes
one final solution so very difficult
to find.
Impossible To Tell
If peace talks occur it is
impossible to determine what

concessions will be made. Cairo's
position continues to be the
return of all territory occupied by
Israel in the 1967 war. Koch views
Israeli development projects in
this territory as "hardly an
indication that Israel intends to
return the land in its entirety."
Meanwhile the Palestinian
question looms heavily in the
background • or perhaps
foreground • of any impending
negotiated settlement. Expressing
the views of many Jewish Student
Union members here, Jane Rubin
states that "establishment of two
individual and seperate states for
Israelis and Palestinians is the only
answer." This, however is
anathema to everything the
Palestinians believe. For
Palestinians, the Zionist state of
Israel must be replaced by a
"secular, bi-national, democratic
state of Palestine." That this state
would be truly democratic or
bi-national is considered

"Palestinian rhetoric" by Jewish
community.
It appears that the fear and
doubt involved in the Arab-Israeli
conflict, coupled with the
militancy of Jews and Palestinians
make the possibility for peaceful
solution remote. In fact, the very
tragedy in the Middle East may be
inherent in what Koch terms the
"dynamic of the conflict: the
inability of anyone to disengage
himself."
A scorpion, meeting a frog
about to swim across the Nile
River, asked the frog if he might
ride along on the frog's back. Said
*the frog: "No. You and I are
enemies, and riding on my back,

"But, I need you to reach the
other side, " replied the scorpion,
"and if I stung you then 1 too

fogic of the argument, the frog

across the Nile River.
Nevertheless, halfway across,
the scorpion stung the frog.
"Why?" demanded the frog as
both he and the scorpion were
sinking. The scorpion answered
"This, my friend, is the Middle

East Crisis. Both Washington and
Moscow, despite their respective
alliances with Israel and Egypt,
seek to avoid a major war in the
Middle East.
Observers agree that the Arab
states need a period of tranquility
to settle their own internal
problems. From the fourth
member of the Jarring Talks,
Israel, comes news that hawkish
Defense Minister Moshe Dayan is

publicly advocating Israel's return
to the peace table.
Nevertheless, there is no
promise that definitive peace talks
will occur. In the Middle East,
where problems are deep-rooted
and comple face-value acceptance
of public differences are often
misleading. David Axelrad of the
Jewish Student Union on campus
remarked "Everybody knows that
Israeli moves towards peace table
are just for the public". Howard
Koch and Michel Nabti, two Hoov
er Institute staff members and
specialists in Middle East Affairs,
hold similiar interpretations of
Israeli statements.
Negligible Worth
More important, the actual
worth of the peace talks remains
negligible in many minds. "There
may be peace talks," stated
Lebanese Michel Nabti, assistant
curator for the Middle East
collection in the Hoover Library,
"but I personally believe there

revolves around the unavoidable
reality of two peoples, Israelis and
Palestinians, who each claim the
right of determination for one
piece of land.
However Koch, research
associate at Hoover, feels that
various peace plans represent
"semantic games." The Big
Powers "cannot face up to the
true dilemna. the ultimate fate of
two conflicting national entities,
Israel and Palestine."
Catering To Peace Talks
Peace talks, at the present
time, cater to the formal Arab
governments, Israel, Russia and
the U.S. Palestine, as an national
entity is not recognized by the
state of Israel, a fact, which alone
nullifies the value of the peace
talks for many Arabs and
certainly the Palestinians.
The Palestinians, people who
were forced to leave their
homeland in the 1 948 war and
were further displaced by the
June War of 1 967, to live in
refugee camps, have exhibited
their refusal to accept passively
the state of Israel and all plans for
negotiations with Israel. In spite
of or perhaps because of human
degradation which defined life in
refugee camps, a Palestinian
consciousness has developed in
the Palestinian Liberation Front.
The Front, whose ultimate
objective is to regain the
Palestinian homeland, "probably
has no direct parallels" remarked
Koch. Since the June War this
movement has gained momentum

validity in the political scene.
'The New Jews'
"They are calling their own
show, styling themselves the "New
Jews," he added, referring to the
passion and determination of
Palestinian guerillas.
Jewish student David Axelrad,
referring to conversations with the
San Francisco Examiner's Israeli
analyst Norbert Yaisharoff
maintains that Israel is nearing the
point where "Palestine state must
be recognized."
However, it continues to be the
legal Arab governments which
have the power and formal
authority to negotiate on areas of
conflict which effect the
Palestinian people. Because these
states do not accept the "retrieval
of Palestinian national homeland"
as their first priority, a second
Middle East conflict exists; a
conflict between the Palestinian
Liberation Front and certain Arab
governments.
Arab Governments
Nabti describes the Arab
governments' response to the
commandos as "definitely
negative." Syria, which has
historically been a mainstay of the
Palestinian guerilla movement can
no longer be depended upon by
the Front. The recent coup which
placed Lieutenant General
al-Assad in power appears much
more amenable to negotiated
settlement than the previous
regime.
In Jordon, where antagonisms

have existed between the
Hashemite government and the
Palestinians since the creation of
the state, the degree of conflict
was tragically displayed in the
September fighting in Amman.
Axelrad believes that had the
guerillas actually overthrown the
Hashemite regime, Israel would
have rushed support to King
Hussein's army.
Unilateral Peace Treaty
Mentioning a recent secret
meeting between Hussein and
Israeli Deputy Premier, Yigael
Allon, Axelrad concludes "Israel
will conclude a unilateral peace
treaty with Jordon."
Hussein's motivation for such a
treaty might be his fears that an
Israeli-Egyptian settlement would
ignore Jordon's demands for
return of East Jeruselum and the
West Bank from Israel.
Termed reactionary by
Palestinian and Egyptian
spokemen alike, Jordon's position
in the Middle East has always
been delicate matter. Various
alliances with Arab nations and
the now implicit collusion with
Israel derived from the secret
meetings (which Israel now
denies) create a precarious
position for pro-American
Hussein.
Koch maintains that "Jordon
as a state will sooner or later cease
to exist. A European construction
to meet now antiquarian needs has
no real reason for existence as a
separate political entity," he
explained.

One of the most recent events
