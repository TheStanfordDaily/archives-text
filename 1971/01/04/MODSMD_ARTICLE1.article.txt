PASADENA—Savor again the final
minute, the tumultuous spellout
rumbling through the bowl of
humanity, the band incessantly
rocking, the second-team offense
running out the clock and the lights
starting to glow lavender in the settling
smog.
When the countdown was over, the
most daring whimsy of Stanford fans
was reality on the Rose Bowl
scoreboard: Stanford 27, Ohio State
17.
The unbeatens were beaten in the
upset of the year and Stanford reveled
in its greatest athletic achievement in
three decades, to the surprise of most
of the 103,839 bowl viewers and a
national TV audience.
But there was little surprise among
the players and coaches.
"There was no question in my
mind," said split end Demea
Washington."I felt we would win at
half time. We just had to go out there
and take it to 'em."
'We Worked Hard'
"We worked awfully hard to win this
football game," said a flushed and
happy Coach John Ralston. But was
Ohio State his toughest test? "At the
time we played USC they were one hell
of a football team," he answered.
Still, the come-from-behind win
demanded four quarters of relentless
precision from both Stanford's
finely-tuned offense and defense, and
the outcome wasn't decided until the
final minutes.
"When 1 caught that touchdown I
thought we had it," said flanker Randy
Vataha who scored Stanford's final
touchdown on a 10-yard pass play with
eight minutes left. "I saw Jim
(Plunkett) drill that right in there. It
was beautiful."
Classic Career
Quarterback Plunkett, finishing up
the classic college career of all time,
completed 20 of 30 passes for 265
yards, 11 of 13 coming in the second
half, including The Pass- a scrambling,
35-yard effort caught by Bob Moore
between two defenders on the Buckeye
two that set up the go-ahead
touchdown in the fourth quarter.
"Jim got flushed and I saw him
scramble to the right," Moore
explained. "I just went for the corner.
He put it in a position so if I didn't
come up with it, nobody would have."
Jackie Brown then scored his second
touchdown—both on sweeps to the
right—to put the Indians ahead to stay,
20-17.
Plunkett, playing perhaps his finest
game for Stanford, was forced to
change his plays at the line of
scrimmage "at least half" the time.

partly to contend with OSU's safety
blitz.
"That (blitz) surprised us. Otherwise
they did the same things they did all
year."
Horowitz Sets Mark
Place kicker Steve Horowitz also
ended his college days brilliantly as he
kicked three extra points and field
goals of 37 and 48 yards, the longer
one surpassing the old Rose Bowl
record by four yards.
The magnificence of the offensive
performance was equalled by the
defensive team, particularly in the
second half when it held OSU—a
notoriously powerful second half
team—to three points in the third
period and none in the fourth.
"They did a great job, especially
going for the ball," Plunkett said
afterward. "They gave up a lot of
yardage between the 20 s, but they
stopped them when they had to."
Brockington Stopped
Particularly on the first play of the
fourth quarter.
That was when the Buckeyes were
fourth and one on the Stanford 20, and
an OSU touchdown at that point would
have put them ahead by 10.
The Big-10 champs went with
fullback John Brockington, who had
already gained 99 yards, and he was
stopped for no gain by Kadziel.
"We were in a goal line defense,"
Kadziel said. "I lined up and went
straight ahead and there was Mr.
Brockington."
At the half, Ralston was concerned
primarily with three kinds of running
options OSU was using. "They had us
guessing wrong every time," he said.
"We just talked about the option
responsibilities."
Fourth Downs Crucial
Down 10 points in the fourth
quarter, Ohio State was forced to pass

more often and with 10 minutes left
Kadziel blocked one Kern pass at the
line of scrimmage and on the next play
co-captain Jack Schlutz intercepted a
pass on the Buckeye 25 to set up
Stanford's final touchdown.
Then twice in the last eight minutes
Stanford defenders held the Buckeyes
on fourth down plays to preserve the
win.
Key defensive play in the first half
was a 2 0-yard field goal attempt by
Fred Schram which was deflected by
defensive back Benny Barnes.
Sande Beats Stillwagon
Of the publicized individual battles,
the one pitting Stanford center John
Sande against OSU All-America middle
guard Jim Stillwagon was the most
prominent.
Sande won it, as Stillwagon was held
to just one tackle and six assists.
"It was a lot of fun out there,"
Sande said with a smile. "I thought we
could move the ball, and in the fourth
quarter the defense went crazy."
Tackle Dave Tipton and linebacker
Jeff Siemon led Stanford defenders
with nine tackles and three assists and
10 tackles and five assists, respectively.
At the end, reaction to the victory
among Stanford players ranged from
pleasure to jubulation.
"This has to be the happiest moment
in my life," said split end Jack Lasater.
Others, like Plunkett, said they were
pleased but looked back at victories
over UCLA and USC with comparable
satisfaction.
Ralston was pressed against a car in
the tunnel near the dressing room for
two hours, answering questions looking
into the bright filming lights and
cooling off with a soft drink.
Well into the second hour the crowd
dwindled and one of Ralston's teen-age
daughters followed the last of the
congratulators. "That was OK, dad,"
she said.

THE OTHER QUARTERBACK-Larry Butler (73) and Pete Lazetich (7) got to Buckeye quarterback Rex Kern on this
play, but Kern still had a fair day on the ground. He led all ballcarriers with 129 yards in 20 carries but he could only manage
40 yards passing, a bit short of Jim Plunkett's 265 yards through the air.
