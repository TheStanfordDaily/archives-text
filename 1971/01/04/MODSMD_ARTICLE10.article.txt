Rhodes Scholar
John Martin Page, Jr., of Saratoga, California, a
senior specializing in the economics of
underdeveloped countries, has won a Rhodes
Scholarship to Oxford University for next fall.
Page, 21, was one of 32 students honored
December 20. Last year ASSU president Patrick A.
Shea won the prestigious scholarship, and since the
award was first offered in 1904, Stanford has had
33 Rhodes Scholars.
At the moment Page is working with the Eood
Research Institute and also researching a book on
the petroleum industry in Nigeria. He recently
collaborated on a professional paper on industrial
development in the African common market. He
has studied in Mexico City under the University's
Latin American studies program.
Phi Beta Kappa in his junior year, he also plays
intramural football and water polo for his eating
club, EI Toro.
6 I Shall Be Released 9
David Harris, one of the leading spokesmen of
the draft resistence movement and former ASSU
president will be released on parole on March 15.
Husband of folksinger—pacifist Joan Baez of
Palo Alto and father of an infant son Gabriel,
Harris is serving a three year sentence for refusing
military induction in federal prison in La Tuna,
Texas.
He was first taken to a federal prison at Safford,
Arizona where he led a hunger strike and refused
to work in protest of poor conditions. He was
transferred to the La Tuna prison where officials
said he behaved "very well."

Low—Lead Gas
Since Oct. 1 the University's fleet of 160
vehicles has been running on low-lead gas in an
effort to lessen mid-Peninsula air pollution.
The University buys 15 ,000 gallons a month
from Texaco and hopes eventually to shift to
unleaded gasoline. At the moment many of the
vehicles do not run well without the lead additive,
reported Elbridge Bacon, Jr., director of the
physical plant.
"Using the low lead's a little thing, but over the
years if more people use it, it's bound to result in
some lessening of over-all pollution," said Bacon.
Hoover Trashed
Eleven windows were broken at the Lou Henry
Hoover annex of the Hoover Institute early
Thursday morning, December 1 7.
Radicals have frequently criticized the Institute
for its scholarly research in anti-communist affairs,
and the same building was attacked by protesters
last spring during "Off ROTO" demonstrations.
There were no witnesses to the incident, but a
student outside a nearby dorm who heard glass
breaking at 12:33 a.m. spotted two young adult
males in the vicinity.
Gadus & McGuire
White Panther leader Tim Gadus was sentenced
to 145 days in Santa Clara County Jail last month
as Judge Edward Scoyen revoked the local
radical's probation.
A week earlier Judge William Ingram had given

Ciadus 40 days in jail for inciting to riot in
downtown Palo Alto and two counts of resisting
arrest, one from a City Council meeting disrupted
by radicals during the summer. The two sentences
will run concurrently.
In passing sentence, Judge Scoyen said, "There
is no purpose in keeping him on probation since he
obviously is not going to comply with its
provisions."
In another case former student Diarmuid
McGuire was found in violation of his terms of
probation by Judge Ingram, but sentencing was
deferred pending appeal by McGuire's lawyer.
Ford Repair Grant
The Center of Advanced Study in the
Behaviorial Sciences, which was badly damaged by
arsonists last spring, was awarded a $70,000 Ford
Foundation grant to help finance rebuilding and
improve security measures.
Preston Cutler, associate director of the Center,
said the money "will go to prevent arson, among
other things."
Estimates of the damage in the April 24 fire ran
to $1 00,000. Added to the figure at the time was
the apparent loss of 25 years of research by Indian
anthropologist Mysore N. Srivinas. However the
loss now fortunately does not appear to be as bad
as original estimates.
"We are fairly confident that by next June his
project will be completed," said Cutler. Most of
the work was recovered with the help of local
experts and a co-worker of Srivinas.
The Center, which has already rebuilt the
damaged wings of the building, was founded with
a Ford Foundation grant in 1 966.
