# Revolutionary Union Splits Over Differences In Ideology, Tactics
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Lenin told his comrades to "split,
split and split again." In the course of
the last month, members of the Bay
Area Revoutionary Union, (RU), a
communist group which has been
prominent in radical activities in the
Stanford area, have followed his advice.
Where once there was one RU, there
now are two.
The name Revolutionary Union will
be retained by the group whose most
prominent member is East Bay radical
Bob Avakian. A new group called
"Venceremos" has been formed which
will include the members of the old RU
from Stanford, Palo Alto, Redwood
City and some from San Francisco,
San Jose, and elsewhere. Both groups
will be multi-national, including both
whites and non-whites as members.
The differences between the two
factions first manifested themselves in a
significant way in a debate over the
appropriate military strategy for a
successful revolution in America. The
Venceremos people drafted a position
paper which argued that the political
consciousness of workers and "Third
World" people in America now is
similar to that of the Russian
proletariet at the time of the 1905
Revolution.
The Avakian group, with the support
of the RU collectives in Richmond,
Berkeley, and some of the RU
membership in San Francisco, San Jose,
and other parts of the country, wrote a
reply stating that the position adopted
by the Venceremos people that
"armed struggle is an actuality
now" is incorrect. The Venceremos
group sees an intensifying urban
guerrilla struggle ahead in America. The
Avakian group sees the task ahead for it

as the building of a mass base, which
will create an insurrection.
Revolution When?
Along with these differences on the
ripeness of the revolution in America
come differing emphases on the
condition of ethnic minorities in the
U.S. Both groups say "The Black
liberation struggle is both a national
and a class question." That is, they
argue that blacks and other ethnic
minorities are oppressed both as
members of their race and as members
of the working class. But the
Venceremos people emphasize the
racism aspect.
In the December 30 issue of the Free
You, Janet Weiss of Venceremos
maintains that "the majority of the top
RU leadership in the Bay Area. . .is
saying that if the struggle of Black
people is not basically a class struggle,
it is not 'correct,' and that Black people
must hold off until the majority of
white Americans are ready to pick up
the gun and fight for socialist
revolution."
The Avakian group is less
enthusiastic in its support of the Black
Panther Party and is reported to have
questioned the efficacy of incidents
like the Marin County courthouse
shoot-out. A member of the Avakian
group described the Venceremos people
as viewing "black people as a nation
almost in a state of total revolt."
Black Nationalism
Members of Venceremos have
charged that the Avakian group has
been moving away from full support of
the right of the black nation to
self-determination. This refers to the
blacks' right of free secession to form

their own independent government.
One member of Venceremos maintains
that a member of the Avakian group
has questioned "the economic feasibility
of a black nation."
In the heat of the dispute, charges of
one faction against the other emerged
which were not directly related to the
original question of military strategy.
People in the Avakian group reminded
Bruce Franklin of Venceremos of his
old job with the Strategic Air
Command; Venceremos people pointed
out that their group had more women
in positions of leadership than the
Avakian group did.
Charges and counter-charges arose
about the disciplining and purging of an
RU collective in San Francisco and of
an RU journalist in San Jose. Also, a
good deal of antagonism was generated
by a decision of the RU leadership
(Avakian group) to make Roxanne
Dunbar, a nationally prominant figure
in the Women's Liberation movement,
a secret rather than an open member of
the RU. She had been recruited for the
RU by the Venceremos faction in Cuba
and had intended to go on a recruiting
drive in the South to bring collectives
into the RU.
A Stanford radical who was with the
Worker-Student Alliance and the
Progressive Labor Party last year
described the split in the RU as a
left-right split with the Venceremos
people on the right-wing. He considers
the Avakian group to have a greater
working class orientation. A member of
the New Left Project commented that
"anti-authoritarian theory leads one to
expect that centralized parties will
split. It's now two, three, many
vanguards."
