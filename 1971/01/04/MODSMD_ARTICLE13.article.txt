66 Soccer Fans Killed
GLASGOW, Scotland — This city, normally divided by
fierce sports rivalries, united yesterday in mourning 66
soccer fans who perished in Britain's worst sporting
disaster.
The game at which the disaster occurred pointed up
the religious division in the city, with Roman Catholics
supporting one team and Portestants the other. The
victims were on the side of the field of the team
supported by Protestants. The game ended in a 1 -1 tie.
Disaster came at Stairway 13 of Ibrox Stadium in
the closing seconds of the showpiece match between
Celtic and Rangers, the two Glasgow clubs which
dominate Scottish sport and have followers throughout
the soccer-playing world.
Steel crowd-channeling barriers collapsed under the
weight of fans pressing for the exit. A human cascade
tumbled down the stairway, pushed on by the
unknowing crowd behind. Bodies piled on bodies, and
200 were injured in addition to those who died.
Laos, Cambodia Bombed
SAIGON — An armada of U.S. warplanes carried a
three-pronged bombing campaign over wide areas of
Indochina yesterday, concentrating on suspected
enemy supply trails in Laos and Cambodia.
The campaign was designed to interrupt North
Vietnamese war materials being ferried through Laos
and Cambodia to South Vietnam and to provide air
support for Cambodian and Laotion troops, informed
sources said.
Damage caused by yesterday's raids was not assessed
immediately. U.S. military officials reported last
ITiursday that American bombing raids in Southern
Laos in the period December 19-28 destroyed what
apparently was one of the largest North Vietnamese
supply depots along the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
Ocean Dumping Banned
SAN FRANCISCO — Waste disposal, which biologists
found damaged sea life, is now banned in a semi-circle
of the Pacific Ocean stretching 33 miles out from San
Francisco's Golden Gate.
The prohibition ordered by the California Regional

Water Quality Control Board became effective the first
of the year and is being policed by the Coast Guard,
state Fish and Game Department vessels "and even
volunteers such as airline pilots and private
yachtsmen," said board chairman William C. Weber.
Violators can be fined $6,000 per day under a tough
state law enacted last year, he said.
The ban extends to seagoing ships, "which have had
a habit of dumping before arriving in port," Weber
said.
Authority to invoke the ban exists because the
Farallones, some 30 miles off San Francisco, are part
of the state "and it's a headlands-to-headlands
proposition extending from Point Reyes to the north
to Half Moon Bay to the south," he said.
91st Congress Ends
WASHINGTON — The 92 nd Congress faces early
renewal of disputes over the supersonic transport
subsidy and welfare reform, left unresolved after
adjournment of the longest congressional session in 20
years.
The 91st Congress finally quit Saturday afternoon,
less than 24 hours before its constitutional mandate
ended at noon yesterday.
Both houses resume work on January 21, and
President Nixon informed their leaders he will deliver
his State of the Union message on the night of January
22.
Programs to upgrade and overhaul the nation's
health-care services, including a form of health
insurance, are likely to be key points in Nixon's
legislative program, along with welfare reform and
federal-state revenue sharing which failed to pass the
old Congress.
Dallas, Baltimore Win
SAN FRANCISCO — The Dallas Cowboys defeated the
San Francisco 4 9ers 17-10 Sunday for the National
Football Conference championship and a Super Bowl
berth against the Baltimore Colts.
BALTIMORE — Johnny Unitas lead the Baltimore
Colts to a 27-17 upset victory over the Oakland
Raiders in the first American Football Conference
championship game.
