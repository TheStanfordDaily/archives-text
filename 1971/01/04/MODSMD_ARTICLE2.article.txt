# Leaflet Blasts Lyman
## SJC Decisions Questioned 
### FRANK MILLER MARSHALL KILDUFF 
A leaflet distributed during finals
week accusing President Richard W.
Lyman of trying to reverse recent
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
decisions has once again brought into
question the fairness of the University's
judicial system and the administration's
legal motives.
The controversy surfaced in the
leaflet which claimed Lyman did not
like the SJC's recommendations that
charges be dropped against three of
four students for allegedly disrupting a
class during the student strike last

spring. According to the leaflet's
authors, Lyman also objected to the
SJC's recommendation that the fourth
student, Stanley Krute, receive a
suspended sentence of one quarter's
suspension pending good behavior.
Lyman, who makes the final decision
in SJC disciplinary cases, asked for
more information regarding their
recommendations in a letter to the
group on Dec. 9. "I find it most
difficult if not impossible to act
jonscientiously on the other
recommendations given the spare
nature of the Council's decision,"
Lyman wrote.

Lyman objected to the SJC's
decision to suspend its sentence for
Krute, and stated, "I cannot discharge
my responsibility with respect to this
sentence without fuller knowledge of
the facts. I regard participation in the
disruption of a class at this University
as one of the most serious offenses
which a student or any other member
of the University community can
commit. The sentence recommended
thus seems to me light."
Law and Order
The leaflet's authors, who call
themselves the "Committee for Justice
at Stanford" claim that "Lyman is
seeking information to reverse the SJC
decision. He may be trying to pressure
the SJC into taking a strong Law and
Order stance in all subsequent political
cases; or he may be attempting to
establish 'one man rule' at Stanford."
Lyman defended his action as proper
because of the scanty information given
in the original SJC opinions. In his
letter he said, "whereas here, the
offense charged is a serious one and the
Council is itself divided in the proper
disposition of the case 1 must have
more information than you have made
available to me."
He added that it would be more fair
to the students involved if more
information were provided. "The
Stanford community is entitled to
know the interpretations given that law
so that there is some guide for future
conduct and also that it might be able
to decide whether additional legislation
is needed," Lyman said.
Scanty Opinions
Yesterday, Lyman questioned what
the authors of the leaflet would have
thought if the SJC had handed down a
very tough punishment and found
everyone guilty and provided "scanty"
opinions. "If it's right to inquire to get
the reasons behind the judgement when
it's tough, it's also just to get them
when the judgement is lenient," he
said.
Bill Evers, New Left Project member
and one of the authors of the leaflet,
said yesterday that the leafletters are
"trying to analyze more the moves the
administration is making than promote
the legitimacy of the SJC."
The leaflet also charged Lyman with
appointing "a highly paid prosecutor to
the SJC while refusing to appoint a
'public defender," making rules about
open meetings "which should have
been made by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council,"and continually
maintaining that "mere presence of a
student in the vicinity of a disruption
makes that student guilty."
Another public SJC trial of three
students accused of a similar disruption
last spring will be held Thursday.

the facts. I regard participation in the
disruption of a class at this University
as one of the most serious offenses
which a student or any other member
of the University community can
commit. The sentence recommended
thus seems to me light."
Law and Order
The leaflet's authors, who call
themselves the "Committee for Justice
at Stanford" claim that "Lyman is
seeking information to reverse the SJC
decision. He may be trying to pressure
the SJC into taking a strong Law and
Order stance in all subsequent political
cases; or he may be attempting to
establish 'one man rule' at Stanford."
Lyman defended his action as proper
because of the scanty information given
in the original SJC opinions. In his
letter he said, "whereas here, the
offense charged is a serious one and the
Council is itself divided in the proper
disposition of the case 1 must have
more information than you have made
available to me."
He added that it would be more fair
to the students involved if more
information were provided. "The
Stanford community is entitled to
know the interpretations given that law
so that there is some guide for future
conduct and also that it might be able
to decide whether additional legislation
is needed," Lyman said.
Scanty Opinions
Yesterday, Lyman questioned what
the authors of the leaflet would have
thought if the SJC had handed down a
very tough punishment and found
everyone guilty and provided "scanty"
opinions. "If it's right to inquire to get
the reasons behind the judgement when
it's tough, it's also just to get them
when the judgement is lenient," he
said.
Bill Evers, New Left Project member
and one of the authors of the leaflet,
said yesterday that the leafletters are
"trying to analyze more the moves the
administration is making than promote
the legitimacy of the SJC."
The leaflet also charged Lyman with
appointing "a highly paid prosecutor to
the SJC while refusing to appoint a
'public defender," making rules about
open meetings "which should have
been made by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council,"and continually
maintaining that "mere presence of a
student in the vicinity of a disruption
makes that student guilty."
Another public SJC trial of three
students accused of a similar disruption
last spring will be held Thursday.
A leaflet distributed during finals
week accusing President Richard W.
Lyman of trying to reverse recent
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
decisions has once again brought into
question the fairness of the University's
judicial system and the administration's
legal motives.
The controversy surfaced in the
leaflet which claimed Lyman did not
like the SJC's recommendations that
charges be dropped against three of
four students for allegedly disrupting a
class during the student strike last

spring. According to the leaflet's
authors, Lyman also objected to the
SJC's recommendation that the fourth
student, Stanley Krute, receive a
suspended sentence of one quarter's
suspension pending good behavior.
Lyman, who makes the final decision
in SJC disciplinary cases, asked for
more information regarding their
recommendations in a letter to the
group on Dec. 9. "I find it most
difficult if not impossible to act
jonscientiously on the other
recommendations given the spare
nature of the Council's decision,"
Lyman wrote.

Lyman objected to the SJC's
decision to suspend its sentence for
Krute, and stated, "I cannot discharge
my responsibility with respect to this
sentence without fuller knowledge of
the facts. I regard participation in the
disruption of a class at this University
as one of the most serious offenses
which a student or any other member
of the University community can
commit. The sentence recommended
thus seems to me light."
