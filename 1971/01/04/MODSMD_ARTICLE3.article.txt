# Grad Program Rated Fourth Nationwide
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
— j _
The platonic ethic of "sound minds
and sound bodies" paid a double
dividend this past weekend with the
announcement that the University's
graduate programs are the fourth best
in the nation.
The rating, based on a survey of over
600 scholars conducted by the
American Council on Education, found
the faculty among the top five
nationwide in 16 of 32 fields. The
effectiveness of the graduate program
was rated even higher.
The new rank compares favorably
with a sixth place showing in the last
survey (1966). In that year, Harvard
was voted the top school in the nation,
followed by Berkeley, Yale, Princeton,
and the University of Chicago. In the
present survey, Berkeley took the top
spot, with Harvard and Yale rated
second and third respectively.
The Stanford departments of
psychology and pharmacology were
termed the best nationwide, while
electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering and biochemistry were
rated second. The zoology program was
the third best in the country, as was
chemistry, a position shared with the
Berkeley chemistry department.
Survey's Challenge
President Richard W. Lyman noted
that, "The enormous academic
momentum developed under
Chancellor Wallace Sterling during the
1 950's clearly has been sustained at
Stanford during the last half of the
1 960's.
"The findings of this survey of
scholars provide both an inspiration
and a challenge to all of us who seek to
improve Stanford still further in the
1970 V

The overall rankings were computed
by Dr. H.W. Magoun, dean of the
graduate division of UCLA, who took
the rankings in each discipline for each
school and divided the total by the
total number of subjects reviewed. He
noted that Stanford, in increasing its
quality, was bucking a national trend
among private institutions.
The upward moves of both Bay Area
schools was termed surprising in light
of the well publicized unrest on both
campuses.
Report Questions Ph.D's.
The report concurred with the recent
Carnegie Commission study in
suggesting that graduate schools may be
turning out a surplus of Ph.D's. It
noted that, "Doubts must be
entertained whether the addition of
more quality facilities and programs in
areas of relatively abundant production
of traditional Ph.D. degrees can either
be justified or supported."
It recalled projections that by 1980,
there will be some 50 ,000 Ph.D'sto fill
an expected demand for 7 4 00
doctorates in the teaching professions.
One educator, Dr. Andrew
Billingsley, vice president for academic
affairs at Howard University, harshly
criticized the report. Noting that no
predominately black schools were
included in the survey, he said that the
survey was, "based essentially on the
ratings of a hierarchical peer group that
has largely excluded black people from
its midst for last three to five years."
Only those institutions which had
granted over 100 doctorates between
1 957 and 19f>7 were included in the
survey. Billingsley said Howard had
granted fi.'l Ph.D's during that period.

dividend this past weekend with the
announcement that the University's
graduate programs are the fourth best
in the nation.
The rating, based on a survey of over
600 scholars conducted by the
American Council on Education, found
the faculty among the top five
nationwide in 16 of 32 fields. The
effectiveness of the graduate program
was rated even higher.
The new rank compares favorably
with a sixth place showing in the last
survey (1966). In that year, Harvard
was voted the top school in the nation,
followed by Berkeley, Yale, Princeton,
and the University of Chicago. In the
present survey, Berkeley took the top
spot, with Harvard and Yale rated
second and third respectively.
The Stanford departments of
psychology and pharmacology were
termed the best nationwide, while
electrical engineering, mechanical
engineering and biochemistry were
rated second. The zoology program was
the third best in the country, as was
chemistry, a position shared with the
Berkeley chemistry department.
Survey's Challenge
President Richard W. Lyman noted
that, "The enormous academic
momentum developed under
Chancellor Wallace Sterling during the
1 950's clearly has been sustained at
Stanford during the last half of the
1 960's.
"The findings of this survey of
scholars provide both an inspiration
and a challenge to all of us who seek to
improve Stanford still further in the
1970 V

The overall rankings were computed
by Dr. H.W. Magoun, dean of the
graduate division of UCLA, who took
the rankings in each discipline for each
school and divided the total by the
total number of subjects reviewed. He
noted that Stanford, in increasing its
quality, was bucking a national trend
among private institutions.
The upward moves of both Bay Area
schools was termed surprising in light
of the well publicized unrest on both
campuses.
Report Questions Ph.D's.
The report concurred with the recent
Carnegie Commission study in
suggesting that graduate schools may be
turning out a surplus of Ph.D's. It
noted that, "Doubts must be
entertained whether the addition of
more quality facilities and programs in
areas of relatively abundant production
of traditional Ph.D. degrees can either
be justified or supported."
It recalled projections that by 1980,
there will be some 50 ,000 Ph.D'sto fill
an expected demand for 7 4 00
doctorates in the teaching professions.
One educator, Dr. Andrew
Billingsley, vice president for academic
affairs at Howard University, harshly
criticized the report. Noting that no
predominately black schools were
included in the survey, he said that the
survey was, "based essentially on the
ratings of a hierarchical peer group that
has largely excluded black people from
its midst for last three to five years."
Only those institutions which had
granted over 100 doctorates between
1 957 and 19f>7 were included in the
survey. Billingsley said Howard had
granted fi.'l Ph.D's during that period.
