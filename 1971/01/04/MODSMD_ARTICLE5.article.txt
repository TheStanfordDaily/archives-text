# Male -Female Ratio May Be Altered
## 
### EMMA PRICE 
The University is currently considering the effects
of changing the undergraduate male-female ratio,
according to Dean of Admissions Fred A. Hargadon.
To this end, the Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions recently formed a Subcommittee on
Female Admissions.
The undergraduate male-female ratio has steadily
declined over the past few years. The present
freshman class has approximately 900 men and 500
women. However, there are no plans at present to
equalize this figure any further.
According to Hargadon, this 9 :5 ratio does not
indicate that female students are more qualified than
are male students. He pointed out that Stanford
receives many more male applicants than female, so
that the percentage of men and women applicants
offered a place at Stanford is approximately equal:
23 percent of the male applicants and 21 percent of
the female applicants.
Applicant Pools Equivalent
Furthermore, according to Hargadon, the applicant
pools of men and women are roughly equivalent in
terms of SAT's and high school averages. "The data
do not suggest severe inequalities in the treatment of
women," Hargadon said.
However, Hargadon made several qualifications to
this statement. He pointed out that applicants know
about Stanford's ratio before they apply. This may
discourage some females from applying.
Hargadon also has a more basic doubt about his
own figures. "I remain skeptical," he said, "of the
notion that equal treatment should be defined in
terms of percentages. For the moment, however, I am
lacking any very good substitute."
No Special Treatment
However the Admissions Dean does not believe
that the current position of women seeking admission

should be compared to that of blacks and other racial
minorities. He does not think that special treatment
should be given to women as it now is for minority
groups.
Hargadon gave two reasons for this. "In the first
place, we have no idea how many women who
wanted to go to college were unable to do so because
of discrimination. Secondly, there is no women's
community which we wish to build up in the same
way as there is a black or Chicano community," he
stated.
Another problem, according to Hargadon, is the
discrimination that women face after graduation. "We
could create a group which is over-educated and
under-employed," he stated.
Committee's Role
The committee which has just been created must
consider two alternative ways of changing the ratio:
enlarging the freshman class, and/or alteration of the
present ratio while keeping approximately the same
class size.
These two alternatives must be considered in terms
of the consequences in such areas as curriculum,
housing, faculty, resources, and social affairs.
Hargadon stated, "If we changed the ratio
substantially, the toughest problem we would face
would be how to change around the resources of the
University so as to beef up the non-sciences. I think if
we could do this, all the other changes which would
be needed in such areas as housing and social life,
would more or less take care of themselves."
Science Enrollment
Dr. Nancy Cross, a Stanford alumna who is
currently organizing a petition to the Board of
Trustees to change the ratio, believes there are ways
to cope with the problems of enrollment in the
sciences. She says,"I think that the displaced

engineering faculty could be re-assigned from
teaching technical engineering classes to teaching
project-oriented courses on topics related to ecology,
such as the SWOPSI courses which some engineering
professors are now teaching.
"I don't see changing the ratio as a problem, but
rather it would be a problem-solver. It will help to
make Stanford relevent to the present society," she
said.
Cross feels that several other aspects of Stanford
will have to change if an increase in the number of
undergraduate women is to be a success. "In the first
place, the counselling services at Stanford should be
equalized by sex," she stated.
More Female Professors
"Women need advisors who understand their needs
and problems. In addition, there are many men who
would probably prefer to deal with a woman
counselor.
"Secondly, there must be many more women
professors to serve as models for the women
students," Cross stated. "Women's colleges, which
usually have equal numbers of men and women on
their science faculties, get many more girls majoring
in science than Stanford does.
"Thirdly, Stanford literature must be written so
that it acknowledges the existence of women. This is
particularly important in regards to material sent to
applicants, almost all of which is written in
"Manglish"; that is, it is obviously by and for men,"
Cross added.
"In summary," she stated, "Everything at Stanford
should be equalized by sex and diversified by race,
just as our entire society is. All University committees
should be formed this way, so should all levels of the
faculty and administration.
"A good place to begin to create this type of
University is with the undergraduate student body."

"I remain skeptical of the notion that equal treatment
should be defind in terms of percentages. For the moment,
however, 1 am lacking any good substitute."
"We could create a group (women) which is
over-educated and under-employed."
