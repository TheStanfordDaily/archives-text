# 'Daily' Beats OSU In Ink Rosebowl
## 
### WARREN G. WONKA 
In a performance indicative of
things to come, the fearless Daily
staffers won the first-ever "Rose
Inkbowl" Thursday with a
hard-fought 8-0 victory over the
staffers of the Ohio State Daily
Lantern.
Under the watchful lenses of
the KNBC camera crew, which
filmed much of the first half, the
Indian inkers came out strong.
The stalwart defense held the
Buckeyes on their first series and
the Indians scored first time they
had the ball.
The drive was spearheaded by
quarterback Hall Daily, who
completed the first four passes he
threw. The score came on the pass
from Daily to Fred Mann. Daily
ran in for the extra point and the
score was 8 -0.

It looked as though the
Dailyites might make a rout out
of it, but quarterback Daily
injured his knee and saw no
further action after the scoring
drive.
Although the offense failed to
score again, a stellar defensive
effort preserved the victory. A
fine secondary comprised of Ed
Kohn, Big Bob Litterman, and
Mann covered the Bucks like
blankets while Cliff Nancarrow,
Frank Miller, Dave Gonzalez, and
Don Tollefson constantly
pressured the OSU quarterback.
The victory evened the Daily's
record at 1-1 for the year and
coach Fred Leeson said he is
confident his troops will win again
next year, but he admitted they
could use some help from the
varsity.
