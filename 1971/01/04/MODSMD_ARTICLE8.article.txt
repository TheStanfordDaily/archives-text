# A 						Wild Coupla' Days
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
It wasn't a weekend to talk or
write about. At least at 5 p.m.
Friday it wasn't.
It was a weekend to break
down doors about, get drunk
about, get stoned about, grab
people you knew and scream in
their faces about, grab people you
didn't know and get screamed at
about. That's the sort of weekend
it was.
And anyone that tells you that
it's possible to describe the feeling
of the last quarter of that
football game, the feeling that
siezed a bunch of normal, fairly
intelligent people and made their
rooting section look like a mental
ward — if anyone says it's possible
to describe that feeling, they're
like the guys who picked Ohio
State by ten; they don't know
their posterrios from their elbows.
Hie whole weekend had started
out so unpretentiously. You came
to L.A., stayed and maybe
mooched off a few friends. You
went to Disneyland or took in
Busch Gardens. Maybe you took
in too much of Busch gardens.
Anyhow, what you did was your
hangup, or perhaps hangover.
Thursday night was New Year's
Eve. Maybe you partied with your
friends. Maybe you didn't party.
Maybe you don't have any
friends. Try Scope.
Bloomers
At any rate, Friday morning
was the Rose Parade. One and a
half million people came out to
see large paper mache globs with
flowers pasted on the pretty girls
waving from them. Also there was
the additional attraction of
dozens of high school marching
bands and Grand Marshal Billy
Graham. It was the Monterey Pop
of the Bermuda shorts and
Instamatic camera set.
If you watched it on T.V., you
had the additional pleasure of
Betty White. I like her because
I've always been a great admirer
of her husband Allan Ludden, the
host of "Password."
But when you realize that there
were five hundred thousand
people at Woodstock and that
three times as many people turned
out for "the pageantry of the
Rose Bowl," perhaps the most
graphic word to describe the
parade is frightening.

Then there was the game. That
was what the whole weekend was
about. All the floats, parties,
friends, Disneylands had merely
been foreplay to the opening
whistle.
You looked at the other side.
Ohio State looked like a bunch of
automatons. Yes, that was it!
Woody Hayes was a deamonic
coach who had turned his players
into machines. They made no
mistakes but pulverized opposing
teams into football-player burger
and left them littering the
Astroturf.
9-0. Undefeated. That told the
story. Ohio State didn't lose.
Ever. Even I thought so.
But Steve Horowitz decided
that someone had made the field a
little too small for his toe, as he
kicked balls to the back line of
the endzone on the kickoffs. If
some guy named Newton had
discovered a law that said the
earth pulls objects toward it,
someone obviously forgot to tell
Steve about it as he kicked a 48
yard field goal.

Then there was Bob Moore who
thought that two guys right on
you was pretty irrelvant to
catching passes. Of course, there
was Jim Plunkett. The number of
figures of his pro contract will tell
you the game he played.
There was supposedly a pretty
good guy on Ohio named
Stillwagon. Twice All-American or
something. I didn't see him all
afternoon. Maybe that's because I
was watching the ball carrier and
Jim was just never around. The
game ended.
The stands were easy »to
describe — insane. How often do
you see guys embracing each
other, jumping up and down
together, and screaming in each
other's faces?
As people finally began to file
out, you'd see a few people you
knew. You'd say hello and just
have a big smile. There wasn't
much to be said. Eleven guys in
red had said it all, and the
glittering lights on the scoreboard
were the best story about that
weekend that was going to be
written.

THE WHOLE STORY: Lights set against the evening Pasadena sky
sum up the 57 th Rose Bowl. Stanford fans who had learned to be
wary of waning seconds in football games in times past gleefully
counted off the final half minute as the Indians with an
insurmountable 10 point lead finished their upset of the
second-ranked Buckeyes.

THE END: Wade Killefer, Dave Tipton and Art Smiley, among others, weave through a happy mob
towards the dressing room.
