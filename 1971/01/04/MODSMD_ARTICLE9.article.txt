# Locker Scenes
## The 						Words Didn't Matter 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The eyes of the TV cameras
had turned to Florida and most of
the 1 03,839 fans were on their
way to the first of many parties at
which this game would be forever
reminisced. But deep below the
fog-covered stands of the Rose
Bowl were those who would savor
the day's occurence more than
anybody else.
For this day which marked the
culmination of years of hope and
work belonged to the Stanford
players and coaches who
thoroughly enjoyed every minute
of the post-game excitement.
Words Flow
The scene in the locker room
was predictable. Everyone wore a
smile and continually heaped
praise on each other. Some
players talked about how they
had taken it to the Buckeyes, but
others had nothing but praise for
their vanquished opponents.
It seemed as if every reporter in
the world wanted to talk to who
else but Number 16â€”Jim

Plunkett. And this quarterback,
who had added yet another laurel
to a college career few had ever
equaled, was more than happy to
answer a seemingly endless stream
of questions.
Finally after most of the other
players had dressed, Plunkett
sneaked away to the showers. But
as soon as he got back to his
locker there were more reporters
and more questions. Outside the
locker room John Ralston was
fielding as many of the same
questions, but he didn't mind,
either.
But for all the words which
were spoken, only one thing really
mattered and everyone knew it.
Of the 4 4 points on the
scoreboard outside, 27 belonged
to Stanford and that was all that
was important.
Less than a football field's
length away was another locker
room. But this one was inhabited
by those who had accounted for
the other 17 points.
The mood around this locker
room was equally predictable.

Just as they had done at their
practices, Los Angeles County
Sheriff Deputies kept the
unwanted out of the Ohio State
locker room.
After 20 minutes behind locked
doors the field general consented
to say a fiew words. Oh yes,
Woody Hayes was gracious in
defeat, but it was still only words.
His face and those of the rooters
and most of all the players though
reflected the story of the
scoreboard.
Woody Speaks
As usual, Woody muzzled his
troops, but a few had a word or
two of praise for the victors as
they filed out to their busses.
Hayes sat silently on the first seat
of the first bus with his chin on
his hand, looking tired and
dejected.
Finally the last player climbed
aboard and the Buckeyes started a
long trip back to the
Huntington-Sheraton Hotel,
which would be followed by an
even longer one back to
Columbus.
The sound of the departing
busses was soon drowned out by
the waning sounds of the Stanford
band which played on in the
Pasadena darkness. For after 30
years, this New Year's Day once
again belonged to the Sons of the
Stanford Red.
