# Nixon Has 'Great Hope' For Next Two Years
## 
### ED KOHN 
In a discussion with four network television reporters
last night, President Richard M. Nixon continued to
express optimism over his economic planning and his
policies for "winding down" the Indochinese War.
Using his familiar slicing hand gestures and smiling
slightly as he responded to questions posed during the
hour-long "Conversation with the President," Nixon said
he has "great hope for the next two years."
Economically, the President said, "1971 will be a good
year, and 1 972 will be a very good year."
Leaning slightly toward the television cameras, Nixon
termed "the end of America's combat role" in Indochina
as his principle achievement during his first two years in
office.
But, he said, "the tragedies of Kent State, Jackson
State and the University of Wisconsin" have tempered his
achievement in the foreign policy field. Seven students
died at those three schools recently, six shot by National
Guardsmen and law enforcement personnel and a seventh
killed in a revolutionary bombing.
'Just Peace'
"We are on the way out (of Indochina)," the President
said, "and we're on the way out in a way that will bring a
just peace, the kind of peace that will discourage that kind
of aggression in the future, and that will build, I hope, the
foundation for a generation of peace.
"That's our major achievement."
"Before we can really get a lift of a driving dream, we
have to get rid of some of the nightmares we inherited.
One of those nightmares is war without end. We are
ending that war ..." the President said.
"We've got to quiet this country down at home. We've
made some progress in this regard, but not enough," he
said.
"If we can get this country not thinking how to fight a
war but how to win a peace, if we can get this country
thinking of clean air and clean water . . . welfare
reform . . . revenue sharing . . . then we can have the lift
of a driving dream."
No New Taxes
Nixon said that Congress' failure to pass his welfare
reform proposal, which would have established a
minimum family income, was a major disappointment
during the first half of his term.
The President said he does not plan to ask Congress to
approve new taxes, wage and price controls, or a
value-added tax, a type of industry-wide sales tax. "I have
decided that none of them at this time would work," he
said. Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, in the past had suggested consideration of wage
and price controls.
Nixon said that confidence in the nation's economy

was being restored. "We are making real progress in
beginning to control inflation. We could perhaps point to
the fact that in the last 15 years there have only been a
few years in which inflation was below five percent," he
said.
The President said his new budget, which will be
submitted to Congress later this month, will contain a
deficit but will not be inflationary. "I have faith 1 971 will
be a year of expanding economy, a year in which the
rising inflation will begin to go down, a year in which the
unemployment (rate) will begin to go down.
Activist Policy
"The purpose of this administration will be to have an
activist economic policy, a situation in which we can have
expansion in peacetime without inflation or rising
unemployment.
"I am convinced that our policies are right. I am
committed to an activist policy," he said.
Assuming a stiffer appearance for the television
audience, Nixon said he intends to carry out the federal
laws on fair housing. He said these laws require no urban
renewal or housing funds be given to any city with
discriminatory policies. The law does not allow the federal
government to force integration in the suburbs, he said.
The President said efforts to force suburban integration
would be "unrealistic, counterproductive and not in the
interests of better race relations."
'Benign Neglect'
Urban affairs advisor Daniel P. Moynihan received a
"bad rap" for his well-publicized advocacy of a policy of
"benign neglect" toward the nation's racial problems, the
President commented.
"He was not referring to neglect for black Americans or
any Americans," Nixon said, but rather was
"philosophically" recommending that the administration
not react impulsively to violence, but move in a reasoned
manner.
Reiterating that there had been an agreement
permitting U.S. reconnaisance flights over North Vietnam,
the President said that "we will continue to take out the
SAM missile sites" that have been firing on U.S. planes.
He said that the flights must continue to assure the U.S.
forces in South Vietnam that they are safe from attack by
North Vietnam.
Nixon said he would resubmit his welfare reform
proposal rejected by the 92 nd Congress. He said he would
also submit a new comprehensive health-care package and
a revenue-sharing plan that could, he said, save several
cities and states from possible bankruptcy.
The President was interviewed in the White House
library by John Chancellor of NBC, Nancy Dickerson of
the Public Broadcasting System, Eric Sevareid of CBS, and
Howard K. Smith of ABC.

said, "and we're on the way out in a way that will bring a
just peace, the kind of peace that will discourage that kind
of aggression in the future, and that will build, I hope, the
foundation for a generation of peace.
"That's our major achievement."
"Before we can really get a lift of a driving dream, we
have to get rid of some of the nightmares we inherited.
One of those nightmares is war without end. We are
ending that war ..." the President said.
"We've got to quiet this country down at home. We've
made some progress in this regard, but not enough," he
said.
"If we can get this country not thinking how to fight a
war but how to win a peace, if we can get this country
thinking of clean air and clean water . . . welfare
reform . . . revenue sharing . . . then we can have the lift
of a driving dream."
No New Taxes
Nixon said that Congress' failure to pass his welfare
reform proposal, which would have established a
minimum family income, was a major disappointment
during the first half of his term.
The President said he does not plan to ask Congress to
approve new taxes, wage and price controls, or a
value-added tax, a type of industry-wide sales tax. "I have
decided that none of them at this time would work," he
said. Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, in the past had suggested consideration of wage
and price controls.
Nixon said that confidence in the nation's economy

was being restored. "We are making real progress in
beginning to control inflation. We could perhaps point to
the fact that in the last 15 years there have only been a
few years in which inflation was below five percent," he
said.
The President said his new budget, which will be
submitted to Congress later this month, will contain a
deficit but will not be inflationary. "I have faith 1 971 will
be a year of expanding economy, a year in which the
rising inflation will begin to go down, a year in which the
unemployment (rate) will begin to go down.
Activist Policy
"The purpose of this administration will be to have an
activist economic policy, a situation in which we can have
expansion in peacetime without inflation or rising
unemployment.
"I am convinced that our policies are right. I am
committed to an activist policy," he said.
Assuming a stiffer appearance for the television
audience, Nixon said he intends to carry out the federal
laws on fair housing. He said these laws require no urban
renewal or housing funds be given to any city with
discriminatory policies. The law does not allow the federal
government to force integration in the suburbs, he said.
The President said efforts to force suburban integration
would be "unrealistic, counterproductive and not in the
interests of better race relations."
'Benign Neglect'
Urban affairs advisor Daniel P. Moynihan received a
"bad rap" for his well-publicized advocacy of a policy of
"benign neglect" toward the nation's racial problems, the
President commented.
"He was not referring to neglect for black Americans or
any Americans," Nixon said, but rather was
"philosophically" recommending that the administration
not react impulsively to violence, but move in a reasoned
manner.
Reiterating that there had been an agreement
permitting U.S. reconnaisance flights over North Vietnam,
the President said that "we will continue to take out the
SAM missile sites" that have been firing on U.S. planes.
He said that the flights must continue to assure the U.S.
forces in South Vietnam that they are safe from attack by
North Vietnam.
Nixon said he would resubmit his welfare reform
proposal rejected by the 92 nd Congress. He said he would
also submit a new comprehensive health-care package and
a revenue-sharing plan that could, he said, save several
cities and states from possible bankruptcy.
The President was interviewed in the White House
library by John Chancellor of NBC, Nancy Dickerson of
the Public Broadcasting System, Eric Sevareid of CBS, and
Howard K. Smith of ABC.

ONCE AGAIN—Early-morning liner-uppers prepare for the perennial indignity of the interminable wait to make an
exorbitant payment. trash already litters floor.
In a discussion with four network television reporters
last night, President Richard M. Nixon continued to
express optimism over his economic planning and his
policies for "winding down" the Indochinese War.
Using his familiar slicing hand gestures and smiling
slightly as he responded to questions posed during the
hour-long "Conversation with the President," Nixon said
he has "great hope for the next two years."
Economically, the President said, "1971 will be a good
year, and 1 972 will be a very good year."
Leaning slightly toward the television cameras, Nixon
termed "the end of America's combat role" in Indochina
as his principle achievement during his first two years in
office.
But, he said, "the tragedies of Kent State, Jackson
State and the University of Wisconsin" have tempered his
achievement in the foreign policy field. Seven students
died at those three schools recently, six shot by National
Guardsmen and law enforcement personnel and a seventh
killed in a revolutionary bombing.

The President said he does not plan to ask Congress to
approve new taxes, wage and price controls, or a
value-added tax, a type of industry-wide sales tax. "I have
decided that none of them at this time would work," he
said. Arthur F. Burns, chairman of the Federal Reserve
Board, in the past had suggested consideration of wage
and price controls.
Nixon said that confidence in the nation's economy

was being restored. "We are making real progress in
beginning to control inflation. We could perhaps point to
the fact that in the last 15 years there have only been a
few years in which inflation was below five percent," he
said.
The President said his new budget, which will be
submitted to Congress later this month, will contain a
deficit but will not be inflationary. "I have faith 1 971 will
be a year of expanding economy, a year in which the
rising inflation will begin to go down, a year in which the
unemployment (rate) will begin to go down.
Activist Policy
"The purpose of this administration will be to have an
activist economic policy, a situation in which we can have
expansion in peacetime without inflation or rising
unemployment.
"I am convinced that our policies are right. I am
committed to an activist policy," he said.
Assuming a stiffer appearance for the television
audience, Nixon said he intends to carry out the federal
laws on fair housing. He said these laws require no urban
renewal or housing funds be given to any city with
discriminatory policies. The law does not allow the federal
government to force integration in the suburbs, he said.
The President said efforts to force suburban integration
would be "unrealistic, counterproductive and not in the
interests of better race relations."
'Benign Neglect'
Urban affairs advisor Daniel P. Moynihan received a
"bad rap" for his well-publicized advocacy of a policy of
"benign neglect" toward the nation's racial problems, the
President commented.
"He was not referring to neglect for black Americans or
any Americans," Nixon said, but rather was
"philosophically" recommending that the administration
not react impulsively to violence, but move in a reasoned
manner.
Reiterating that there had been an agreement
permitting U.S. reconnaisance flights over North Vietnam,
the President said that "we will continue to take out the
SAM missile sites" that have been firing on U.S. planes.
He said that the flights must continue to assure the U.S.
forces in South Vietnam that they are safe from attack by
North Vietnam.
Nixon said he would resubmit his welfare reform
proposal rejected by the 92 nd Congress. He said he would
also submit a new comprehensive health-care package and
a revenue-sharing plan that could, he said, save several
cities and states from possible bankruptcy.
The President was interviewed in the White House
library by John Chancellor of NBC, Nancy Dickerson of
the Public Broadcasting System, Eric Sevareid of CBS, and
Howard K. Smith of ABC.

In a discussion with four network television reporters
last night, President Richard M. Nixon continued to
express optimism over his economic planning and his
policies for "winding down" the Indochinese War.
Using his familiar slicing hand gestures and smiling
slightly as he responded to questions posed during the
hour-long "Conversation with the President," Nixon said
he has "great hope for the next two years."
Economically, the President said, "1971 will be a good
year, and 1 972 will be a very good year."
Leaning slightly toward the television cameras, Nixon
termed "the end of America's combat role" in Indochina
as his principle achievement during his first two years in
office.
But, he said, "the tragedies of Kent State, Jackson
State and the University of Wisconsin" have tempered his
achievement in the foreign policy field. Seven students
died at those three schools recently, six shot by National
Guardsmen and law enforcement personnel and a seventh
killed in a revolutionary bombing.
'Just Peace'
"We are on the way out (of Indochina)," the President
said, "and we're on the way out in a way that will bring a
just peace, the kind of peace that will discourage that kind
of aggression in the future, and that will build, I hope, the
foundation for a generation of peace.
"That's our major achievement."
"Before we can really get a lift of a driving dream, we
have to get rid of some of the nightmares we inherited.
One of those nightmares is war without end. We are
ending that war ..." the President said.
"We've got to quiet this country down at home. We've
made some progress in this regard, but not enough," he
said.
"If we can get this country not thinking how to fight a
war but how to win a peace, if we can get this country
thinking of clean air and clean water . . . welfare
reform . . . revenue sharing . . . then we can have the lift
of a driving dream."
No New Taxes
Nixon said that Congress' failure to pass his welfare
reform proposal, which would have established a
minimum family income, was a major disappointment
during the first half of his term.
The President said he does not plan to ask Congress to
approve new taxes, wage and price controls, or a
value-added tax, a type of industry-wide sales tax. "I have
