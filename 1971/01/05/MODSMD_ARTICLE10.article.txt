Pitzer At Berkeley
Dr. Kenneth S. Fitzer, former president of
the University for a stormy eighteen months
and a distinguished chemist, will return to a
teaching and research post at California
Berkeley next fall.
After resigning from the presidency last
summer, Pitzer travelled around the world and
studied in Cambridge, England, for several
months. He will become a professor of
chemistry at Berkeley where he earned his
Ph.D. and served as a faculty member for 2 4
years. Before coming here in 1 968, Pitzer was
president of Rice University for eight years.
In an interview after he announced his
surprise resignation, Pitzer revealed that the
two chief reasons for his decision were "the
Nixon administration's failure to end the war
in Southeast Asia, which led to increasing
disruptions on campus, and the relcutance of
wealthy alumni to continue contributing to
the university, which they saw as a hotbed of
ill-mannered radicals."
Serra Street Closed
Serra Street was permanently closed
between Via Palou and Galvez streets last
month rather than spend $155,000 of the
$200,000 necessary to repave the street.
Double rows of barrier posts will be placed
in front of the Business School at History
corner and also at the Biology Building. The
street will become a series of parking
cul-de-sacs. Bicycles—and on a trial basis

motorcycles and scooters—will be allowed to
travel through the closed street ends.
The change will result in a net increase of
eight parking spaces.
Under the plan, cross campus traffic will be
shifted to Campus Drive. Four-way stop signs
will be installed on Palm Drive.
'Big Red RosebowT
History buffs and devotees of football
triumphs will be able to relive the Indians'
1971, visit to the Rose Bowl.
KZSU is making a living documentary of the
game and the people involved in it. Its staff has
worked for weeks recording voices and music.
It's called the "Big Red Rose Bowl."
After KZSU's play-by-play coverage of the
game, Will Pape, station manager, and Maralee
Beck, news director, will do the final editing.
Their product, due for completion Jan. 10,
will be a 44-minute stereo record (for $5.98)
and a four-track stereo tape, running 5 0
minutes (for $8.50). Either may be ordered
from KZSU, "Big Red Rose Bowl," Box 30 08,
Stanford, CA 94305.
In addition to the game itself, the
documentary includes music of the Stanford
Band and interviews with players, coaches,
Alumni Association officials, the pompon
dollies, and students in general.
A brochure filled with pictures of the 1970
football season will be included with either the
record or the tape.
