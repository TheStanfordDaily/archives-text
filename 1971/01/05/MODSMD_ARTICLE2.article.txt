Green Berets Out
SAIGON — The saga of the Green Berets in Vietnam
came to an end Monday with the transfer of the last
two Special Forces camps to the South Vietnamese.
The move reflected the Vietnamization of the war
and the downgrading of the Green Berets, currently
out of favor with U.S. Army regulars, though their
exploits won them fame in song and story, and even a
movie.
At their peak, the Green Berets operated 8 0 camps
in Vietnam, mostly near the borders of Laos and
Cambodia. At each of the camps, a small team of
Green Berets recruited and commanded civilian
irregular mercenaries, largely mountain tribesmen
called Montagnards.
The camps were used as bast's to detect North
Vietnamese infiltration, to keep an eye generally on
enemy movements in Laos and Cambodia and to
make clandestine forays across the borders on
hit-and-run raids or for reconnaissance.
The last camp transfers were carried out as the U.S.
(Command announced further cuts in American troop
strength and amid unofficial predictions the
American withdrawal from Vietnam would be
speeded.
The U.S. Command announced a drop in troop
strength of 2,100 men, lowering the total of
American servicemen in Vietnam as of Dec. 31 to

The figure was the lowest in four years and 8.200
below the 344,000 men President Nixon had set as
the goal for the end of last year.
On the battlefields, no major action was reported
but in the air, U.S. B5 2 bombers attacked North
Vietnamese positions in South Vietnam for the first
time in a month.
Other 852s kept up the pounding of the Ho Chi
Minh Trail in Laos, continuing the war's most
sustained bombing campaign that started Oct. 10.
Gunmen Kill One
PHILADELPHIA — Eight gunmen held up a furniture
store in South Philadelphia on Monday, shot one
employee to death and wounded two others. The
gunman escaped after trying to set 'he store on fire.
Ten other persons, in addition to those shot, were
injured. Most were employes of the store.
Police said the gunmen bound about 25 employes
and customers with tape, herded them into various
parts of the large store and then pistol whipped, beat
and kicked several of them.
They said each of the robbers apparently was
armed with a .45 caliber weapon and had fired
numerous shots in the store before escaping through a
side door moments before police arrived.
Alton G. Barker Sr., 4 0, a maintenance man at the

store, and Dandis Burney, 52, a salesman, were found
shot, their hands tied behind their backs, in the
freight elevator on the third floor.
Barker died later of a chest wound at Pennsylvania
Hospital. Burney was struck in the arm and hand.
Miami Beach Blast
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — An explosion ripped through
an exlusive Miami Beach shopping area Monday,
killing a woman passerby and injuring more than 30
other persons.
The blast, which touched off a blaze that took
firemen 90 minutes to control, was believed caused
by leaking (ias.
Police said an early report indicated the blast came
from a blueprint shop in the building.
Officials at first feared some victims might have
been trapped in the rubble of the burning building,
which housed three businesses, including a restaurant.
But no other bodies had been found more than four
hours after the 3:35 p.m. explosion.
An elderly woman was the apparent lone victim.
Her body was found beneath the rubble in front of
Circle Bluepring Co., adjacent to the restaurant.
The blast was so powerful that it virtually
destroyed the one-story building, broke windows of
shops a block away and knocked a passing
motorcycle policeman off his vehicle.

Miami Beach Blast
MIAMI BEACH, Fla. — An explosion ripped through
an exlusive Miami Beach shopping area Monday,
killing a woman passerby and injuring more than 30
other persons.
The blast, which touched off a blaze that took
firemen 90 minutes to control, was believed caused
by leaking (ias.
Police said an early report indicated the blast came
from a blueprint shop in the building.
Officials at first feared some victims might have
been trapped in the rubble of the burning building,
which housed three businesses, including a restaurant.
But no other bodies had been found more than four
hours after the 3:35 p.m. explosion.
An elderly woman was the apparent lone victim.
Her body was found beneath the rubble in front of
Circle Bluepring Co., adjacent to the restaurant.
The blast was so powerful that it virtually
destroyed the one-story building, broke windows of
shops a block away and knocked a passing
motorcycle policeman off his vehicle.
Green Berets Out
SAIGON — The saga of the Green Berets in Vietnam
came to an end Monday with the transfer of the last
two Special Forces camps to the South Vietnamese.
The move reflected the Vietnamization of the war
and the downgrading of the Green Berets, currently
out of favor with U.S. Army regulars, though their
exploits won them fame in song and story, and even a
movie.
At their peak, the Green Berets operated 8 0 camps
in Vietnam, mostly near the borders of Laos and
Cambodia. At each of the camps, a small team of
Green Berets recruited and commanded civilian
irregular mercenaries, largely mountain tribesmen
called Montagnards.
The camps were used as bast's to detect North
Vietnamese infiltration, to keep an eye generally on
enemy movements in Laos and Cambodia and to
make clandestine forays across the borders on
hit-and-run raids or for reconnaissance.
The last camp transfers were carried out as the U.S.
(Command announced further cuts in American troop
strength and amid unofficial predictions the
American withdrawal from Vietnam would be
speeded.
The U.S. Command announced a drop in troop
strength of 2,100 men, lowering the total of
American servicemen in Vietnam as of Dec. 31 to

The figure was the lowest in four years and 8.200
below the 344,000 men President Nixon had set as
the goal for the end of last year.
On the battlefields, no major action was reported
but in the air, U.S. B5 2 bombers attacked North
Vietnamese positions in South Vietnam for the first
time in a month.
Other 852s kept up the pounding of the Ho Chi
Minh Trail in Laos, continuing the war's most
sustained bombing campaign that started Oct. 10.
Gunmen Kill One
PHILADELPHIA — Eight gunmen held up a furniture
store in South Philadelphia on Monday, shot one
employee to death and wounded two others. The
gunman escaped after trying to set 'he store on fire.
Ten other persons, in addition to those shot, were
injured. Most were employes of the store.
Police said the gunmen bound about 25 employes
and customers with tape, herded them into various
parts of the large store and then pistol whipped, beat
and kicked several of them.
They said each of the robbers apparently was
armed with a .45 caliber weapon and had fired
numerous shots in the store before escaping through a
side door moments before police arrived.
Alton G. Barker Sr., 4 0, a maintenance man at the

store, and Dandis Burney, 52, a salesman, were found
shot, their hands tied behind their backs, in the
freight elevator on the third floor.
