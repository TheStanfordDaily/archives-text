# Ecology Vs. Economy
## SST Crucial To Seattle 
### DOYLE McMANUS Daily Seattle Correspondent 
Seattle has always been a city
concerned with environmental
problems. The Puget Sound area leads
the nation in water pollution control
nearby Lake Washington was actually
'rescued' by conservationists, and the
once-polluted lake is now crystal clear
and Washingtonians are quick to the
defense of their wilderness areas.
But when the Senate this month
denied further funds for the
development of Boeing's giant
supersonic transport (SST), the mood
in Seattle was not one of jubilation, but
one of reinforced despair.
The city is gripped by the worst
economic crisis in its history.
Unemployment has reached 12.5%
worse than during the Depression of
the thirties— and local experts predict a
figure of over 18 % by the end of 19 71.
Families used to living on incomes of
$1 0,000 and more are adjusting to the
rigors of living on unemployment
insurance, their savings depleted. The
real-estate market is flooded with the
suburban homes of fleeing technicians
and engineers; apartment complexes
offer a stereo and a month's free rent
to anyone who will sign a one-year
lease. Some families, unable to meet
mortgage payments, have simply
deserted their homes, leaving their
equity behind.
The problem lies directly with
Boeing, the area's largest employer,
which has already suffered grievous
economic wounds in the wake of
military cutbacks and lost contracts.
From a one-time force of over 100,000 ,
Boeing's Washington employees now
number less than 4 6,000; and SST
rejection would probably cause the
firing of some 5 000 more.
The conservation-minded Northwest
finds itself in a paradox: its economic
health depends on the development of
an airplane that could well be an
ecological disaster.
What the Senate denied in its
52-to-41 vote was a $29 0 million
appropriation for development of a
prototype transport. The SST
appropriation may yet return,
drastically reduced, from House-Senate
conference. But even then its chances
are slim; for the vote indicates a new
congressional concern for the
environment over traditional appeals to

technological process and national
prestige, for which the SST had become
a symbol.
No less than 1 9 Senators who voted
for the SST last year joined Wisconsin
Democrat William Proxmire in his
anti-SST crusade. Among them were
Republicans and Southern Democrats,
won over by a well organized campaign
that had the backing of Senator
Edmund Muskie, the Sierra Club, and
several other influential groups.
Proxmire's message: the SST is no

better than a luxury, and a potentially
lethal one at that. It is feared that the
2000-mile-an-hour jet's sonic booms
would cause avalanches, kill sea birds,
and leave a wake of broken windows;
that its exhaust would pollute the
upper air, cause skin cancer by
preventing the formation of
ultraviolet-filtering ozone, and alter
global weather; and that it would create
intolerable noise levels at airports.
And, critics charge, the eventual $5
billion expense (after a 1963 starting
estimate of $1 billion) would prove to
be a hideously expensive boondoggle in
the light of the airlines' current slump
and the more urgent needs of the
nation.

News Analysis

The pro-SST forces, led by President
Nixon and Washington's Senators
Warren Magnuson and Henry Jackson
(both Democrats), offered appeals to
industrial patriotism, pointed out the
painful proposition of losing the $800
million already spent— and pleaded on
behalf of the sagging Seattle economy.
They argued that the American SST
will be necessary to retain U.S.
aerospace manufacturing's 85 percent
share of the world commercial air
market; otherwise, the potentially vital

supersonic trade will belong solely to
the Russians, British, and French. And
they claimed that the federal
government's investment would be
repaid after 300 of the planes are sold—
although Boeing has only been able to
sell 203 of its 7 4 7's, and is now cutting
its 747 production to five planes a
month.
The counter-arguments were not
strong enough to overcome the
environmental doubts — even though
many of the anti-SST points are largely
unproven. Whatever the final outcome
for Boeing's giant jet, however, the fate
of Washington's economy and its
unemployed remains a problem— and
Seattle remains close to despair.


IN JEOPARDY—The fate of Boeing's giant SST, and that of Seattle's sagging economy, are uncertain after the Senate denied
funds for further development of the needle-nosed monster.
