# Violence Disrupts Reagan Inaugural
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) - Amid cheers
from supporters and obscene chants
from young demonstrators waving Viet
Cong flags, Oov. Reagan took the oath
of office Monday for a second
four-year term and pledged total
reform of the state's welfare system.
In the first inauguration violence in
the state's history, a brief scuffle broke
out as the 5 9-year-old governor gave his
inaugural address. A grav-haired man
about 55 ripped one of the flags from a
youth and crumpled it up.
Uniformed state police and
plainclothes California National Guard
military police dragged a long-haired
blond youth from the fracas about 100
feet from Reagan and later took the
older man into custody.
After the ceremony, Reagan told
newsmen the demonstrators "are like
mosquitoes and flies which are part of
the world, so we just have to put up
with them."
In his 15-minute address, Reagan
said "1 shall propose restructuring
welfare to eliminate waste and the
impropriety of subsidizing those whose
greed is greater than their need."
He rejected as "the easy way out"
any further increases in taxes, saying
t.iat would be a temporary solution at

best. However, he did not say there
would be no tax increase this year.
"Mandated by statute and federal
regulation, welfare has proliferated and
grown into a leviathan of
unsupportable dimensions," he said. Its
cost has risen to more than $2 billion a
year.
Reagan said he has been successful in
his inauguration pledge of four years
ago to "squeeze and cut and trim" the
cost and size of government in the
nation's most populous state.
He mentioned the vast California
Water Project nearing completion,
drops in the state's traffic fatality rate,
reduction of crimes of violence in
major cities and lower numbers of
hospitalized mentally ill.
Taking the oath of office separately
Monday were Atty. Gen. Evelle J.
Younger, Secretary of State Edmund
G. Brown Jr., Controller Flournoy and
Wilson C. Riles superintendent of
public instruction. State Treasurer Ivy
Baker Priest was sworn in Thursday.
Also present at the inauguration
were California's Democratic U.S. Sen.
John V. Tunney and the man he ousted
in the Nov. 3 election, Republican
George Murphy.
