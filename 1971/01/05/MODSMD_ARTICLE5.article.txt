Four years ago today OFF, a movement demanding that
apperdass women be allowed to live off campus, called for a
ten day rent strike. The limited strike represented a
"de-escalation" of tactics from an earlier ultimatum and was an
attempt at non-coercive measures with which the administration
could deal.
If you know of any de-escalations or non-coercive actions,
