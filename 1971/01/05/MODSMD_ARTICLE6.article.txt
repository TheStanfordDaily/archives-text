## The
						Ego Thing 
### barry wood 
The beauty of most things in nature is that they
don't get hung-up on one thing. Daisies and
carrots, butterflies and apples do their thing with a
vengeance, blooming forth for mere moments on
the cosmic stage, and then are content to wither
away forever.
This withering is, of course, the death that gives
their followers room to live. Cows die and grass
grows over their bones, and the grass is eaten again
by cows. This cannibalistic system which has been
dubbed "nature red in tooth and claw" is really
the most sophistocated system of cooperation,
communism, or socialism. Like wings and radar,
nature invented it first.
Like everything else, man is not a thing but an
event, a tube-shaped pattern with energy flowing
in the top and out the bottom. The energy enters
in the form of light, heat, air, water and salt and
fruit, beer and beef. The same energy transformed
goes out the other end in the form of semen, gas,
babies, and various other unmentionables.
This means that man is part of one stream of
energy which does a lot of different things. A man
is the universe being a man, looking out at itself
through a new pair of eyes which means that You
are a Big Act performed by the universe at large.
But, alas, most of us are deluded into the notion
that we are each a separate package of skin and
bones with no connections with nature.
Since we are really waves in a big river, survival
entails getting "with it," rather than fighting the
current. Ecology is what this is all about—getting
with the other wiggly tube-shapes in a great dance
of cooperation. But, since we think of ourselves as
isolated egos, we fight the current, compete with
the other waves, and turn the dance of life into the
"struggle for survival." In short, ecology becomes
ego-logy.
Sheer Ego-Strength
Ego-logy holds to the illusion that each of us is
alone, cut off—a situation that leads to fear,
uncertainty, alienation and, in the extreme,
neurosis, psychosis, and suicide. With nothing in
the universe to lean on (God is dead, remember!)
survival depends on sheer ego-strength alone.
A world full of isolated egos packaged up in
bags of skin is a world destined for trouble, full of
desperate games. For every winner there has to be
a loser, and the egos who "fail"—all the way from
kindergarten finger-painting class to national
elections—are a sorry lot. They placed their faith in
their own ego and then didn't make it.
A man who believes he exists as an ego separate
from his whole environment is living a kind of

fiction. The more serious his conviction, the more
unreal things get.
Lacking the security of a real hook-up with the
world the fictional ego collects
"securities"—insurance policies, stocks, bonds,
university degrees, and money. These of course are
mere symbols, useful only for buying steak and
eggs. But the mad race for the "security" of having
more money than everyone else means investing in
businesses which specialize in tearing down trees,
tearing up mountains, producing shiny junk,
spilling oil, or making bombs.
The Price of Wealth
More money leads to less and less real wealth.
Paradoxically, the fictional ego gets tangled up in
fictions piled on fiction. He thus deludes himself
that his real wealth is increasing because he has
artificial environments of plastic and tin—homes
uniform and bad planning, offices universally dull
to work in, highways so regularly smooth that
travel means passing time, and cities as ugly as the
one just left behind.
This leads to mountains of pure nonsense which
is toted out every night at 6:3o—stock figures
which tell the "state" of the world, GNP's which
indicate "progress," congressional bills which
prove moral "superiority," body counts which
indicate military "power."
It is proof of the unreality of symbolic living
when you get arrested for skinny dipping, when
love-making is only legal under contract, when
having a drink at the Oasis requires 1.D., when
being allowed to eat requires that you carry pretty
pieces of paper and metal in your pocket, and
when having an education equals having a
"degree."
Western civilization, founded on the personal
ego, allows people a billiard-ball existence, with
someone always falling down the tubes. Believing
himself to be a separate "thing," man has lost his
place in the household of the universe, and has to
go it alone. Moreover, so totally deluded are we
that we have designed a symbolic world where all
our values are fictions-numbers, cliches,
catchwords.
The unreality of the ego is most apparent when
we defend the rights of profiteers to tear up and
down the land in the name of "free enterprise." It
is, of course, highly appropriate that Western man,
living the absurd fiction of his own ego, is doomed
to live out the fiction of a future for his offspring,
while he daily destroys the vestiges of hope in its
possibility.
