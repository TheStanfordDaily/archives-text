## That Old Violence Bag 
### jeff weil 
"All right Wendy. You're
coming over a trench in
Guatemala in your powder blue
beret and matching toreador
pants..."
Everyone at the dinner table
smiles nervously, especially
Wendy.
"You've just captured the West
German Ambassador, who looks
uncommonly like your
grandfather, the one who brought
you lemon candy and always
smelled of pipe tobacco."
They are waiting for the punch
line.

"There he is, bound and
gagged, staring with those watery
blue eyes up at you.
"BUT.. . the government has
not come through on the $50,000
ransom, and you have to call their
bluff."
They are beginning to realize
that there is no punch line.
"The Special Forces are closing
in from all sides, so you have to
decide soon. You don't want to
kill him, but think of the
precedent set; kidnapping will be
a useless tactic from now on. Just
picture those starving babies with
pretzeled limbs, swollen
bellies. . . '—Ivor, in "A Short
Course in Topology."
They set up false dichotomies.
Either/or. Violent or pacifist. Let
us dispose of some of the cliches
about violence that will be
circulating all year:
Violence only breeds violence.
Not true. Had the attempt on
Hitler's life succeeded, would that
have bred violence? If someone
had destroyed the napalm
research being done at Harvard,
would that have bred violence? It
can be argued that the brief
violence of the Cuban Revolution
ended the daily violence done to
the Cuban people before 1 959.
Redefining the Term
We should always try to
minimize violence, but we must
extend its definition to include
the violence of the status quo in
Guatemala, all types of
counterinsurgency abroad and at
home, and the violence to minds
and bodies in the factories of
America. When we redefine
violence like this, when we realize
that effectiveness must be a part
of morality, when we see that
many revolutionaries became
revolutionaries only after
nonviolent tactics had failed, then
we can see that "minimizing
violence" sometimes is done by
employing it. Tet offensives
minimize violence more than
votes for Dzu. Support for the
Panthers, whose politics are not
beyond criticism, is less violent
than support for the Urban
Coalition.
You've got to change people's
heads before you can change
society. This slogan is used by
those who take their political
economy from the Beatles.
Needless to say, there must be a
continuous use of education and
of persuasion. The New Left
Project has made it clear that it
would like to convince as many

people as possible to stop their
research voluntarily if it is used to
oppress people. Because of our
past experience, we are not naive
enough to think that all bad
research will stop that easily.
Economic and social
configurations and people's daily
habits have a great deal to do with
where their heads are at. That is
why it is often necessary to
change society first. One could
argue with the penetrating logic of
Carl Oglesby and listen with the
patient understanding of Merle
Rabin all night and never convince
GM's James Roche to get out of
South Africa or to turn over the
assembly lines to the workers.
Non violence is a class
phenomenon. Your hangups
about violence come from your
bourgeois background. Look at
the workers; dig on the blacks. In
fact, pacifism is racist because if
you won't use the means that
blacks...
Why why why do radicals try
to move crowds through guilt, a
liberal motivation? Besides the
poor motivation, the argument is
weak. You can always find blacks
and workers who believe in
nonviolence (King, Chavez). We
must recommend tactics on the
basis of their effectiveness (short
and long-term), not because they
soothe liberal guilt feelings or
bring psychological catharsis.
Stale Lines
Cliches like these often spill
over into the old "violence is
liberating, read Fanon" line.
However, if you read Fanon
carefully, the psychology of the
colonized which he describes does
not apply to white radicals.
Furthermore, a quick look at the
end of The Wretched of the Earth
shows that violence is not always
liberating, even for the Third
World Rebel (e.g., the insomnia
and suicidal obsessions of the
Algerian terrorist, which were
traced to the date of a bombing
he had done).
The idea of nonviolence did not
spring fully unarmed from Joan
Baez' forehead. People looked at
wars, especially the last two world
wars, and saw that violence did
bad things to human beings. It
does. Even People's Wars produce
amputees. Nonviolence was based
on the premise that all human life
is precious. Even the lives of the
oppressors. The Left should never
discard this premise. Hangups that
most people have about pulling
triggers arise from the same

instincts that cause radicals to
have hangups about rat-bitten
children in ghettoes and napalmed
Vietnamese villages. Those who
are overjoyed at the prospect of
violence do not belong in a
humanistic movement. (Example:
During the strike against the
Independent Journal in San
Rafael last summer, the editor of
the paper was shot and died. The
striking workers did not exactly
go into mourning over his death,
but I did not talk to one who was
happy about it; mostly because it
did not help to win the strike.
Reaction of a high school radical:
"Revolutionary heroism. Right
on!" Unquote. Fuck.) As I said
before, we must extend our
definition of violence to include
the violence of the status quo,
then we must use the minimum
necessary means to stop it.
Match Stick Argument
Any violence we do is like the
flame on a match stick compared
to the scorched earth policy of
the U.S. in Vietnam. Well, that's
true. But if our flame merely adds
to the fire it is wrong. In any
social change, someone—some
times those who are least
guilty—of necessity is hurt or
inconvenienced. But my politics
say that any unnecessary damage
to anyone, including the rich, is
not a neutral act, is not just "a
poorly chosen tactic because it
turns off the moderates"; it is
basically wrong. No one has yet
demonstrated that the burning of
the medieval history teacher's
research at Columbia, what
happened at Madison or here last
year at Behavioral Sciences was
necessary. By the way, I do
distinguish between destruction of
property and violence to persons,
but, clearly, burning someone's
life's work is violence to his
person.
Political power comes from
many things, not just "out of the
barrel of a gun." One must only
study the differences in the
bourgeois seizure of power
between the French and English
examples, or the different types
of socialist victory in Cuba and
Chile in order to understand this.
We will do what we have to. We
should do no more.
