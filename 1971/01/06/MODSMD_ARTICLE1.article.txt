# Cards Place Eighth in Final Poll
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's football season may have
officially ended following the Rose
Bowl, but the reliving of thai game and
quite a few other newsworthy items
will keep football in the air for awhile.
The Associated Press released its
final football poll of the season
yesterday and the Indians were ranked
eighth. Nebraska won the mythical
national championship, followed by
Notre Dame, Texas, Tennessee and
Ohio State.
Stanford's win in the Rose Bowl
lifted it from 12th place and dropped
the previously undefeated Buckeyes
from 2nd to sth, but the Cards still
remain below the five teams already
mentioned, as well as Arizona State and
Louisiana State.
Hula Bowl
While most of the players have begun
classes again, several are away
practicing for all-star games to be
played this weekend. Bob Moore, John
Sande and Jim Plunkett are in Hawaii
for the Hula Bowl. John Ralston will be
coaching the North squad in that game
which will be televised Saturday at
1 :00 p.m. on Channel 7 (KGO-TV).

Randy Vataha and Dave Tipton will
be in Tampa, Florida for the American
Bowl Game which can be seen at 11 :0U
a.m. Sunday on Channel 2 (KTVU-TV).
But both Plunkett and Ralston's
names have been in the news for more
than the Hula Bowl.
The professional football draft will
be held in New York on January 28
and it is speculated that Plunkett will
be No. 1 pick. The Boston Patriots,
who had a 2-12 season record, will get
the first choice and they will probably
take Plunkett unless they trade their
first round choice.
Whether or not Plunkett will end up
playing for the Patriots is another
question. The Pats already have a
high-priced quarterback Joe Kapp, who
failed to win for them this season. But
most observers feel their major
problem is a pathetically weak
offensive line, and it is questionalbe
that any quarterback could perform
well under the pressure Kapp was
subjected to.
Plunkett to 4 9 ers?
So naturally the possibility of
trading Plunkett has been rumored
frequently in the past few days.
Reportedly at least 11 clubs have

expressed interest in such a deal. One
such rumor had the San Francisco
4 9 ers offering defensive end Stan
Hindman, tight end Ted Kwalick and a
high draft choice for Boston's first
pick.
The 49ers have denied the offer, but
they do not deny that they have talked
to Boston. And Plunkett has said he
would like to play for the 49ers over
any other NFL club. And admidst all
these rumors there was a story coming
out of Minneapolis Monday that the
Patriots might keep Plunkett and trade
Kapp to Atlanta.
In the three and a half weeks
between now and the draft there will
undoubtedly be talk of many more
possible trades. Still, Boston with the
first pick will make the final decision.
All that is certain is that Plunkett will
wind up with a financially lucrative
contract, no matter who he plays for.
Plunkett's Jersey
Plunkett's name, or more correctly
his jersey, was in the news in another
way yesterday. According to a story in
the San Francisco Chronicle, 4 9er
promotion man and former Stanford
player, Dick Berg has started a
campaign to retire Plunkett's uniform.

When asked about this, Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor said he didn't
think it would happen. As far as he
knew only Ernie Nevers' uniform had
ever been retired and he didn't think

ALL-STAR CENTER—Senior center John Sande will close out his career in the
Hula Bowl this weekend in Hawaii. Sande had possibly the finest game of his
career in the Rose Bowl working against and completely dominating Ohio State's
All-American middle guard Jim Stillwagon.
Plunkett's would be. Taylor said, "It's
probably better to have him honored in
some other way than retiring his
uniform. It would probably be more of
an honor to have it worn."
Since the decision regarding the
matter would most likely come down
to Taylor it is pretty certain someone
will be wearing No. 16 again in the
future.
Finally John Ralston has been in the
news quite a bit recently, and not only
in articles praising his Rose Bowl win.
KTVU-TV sports commentator Rick
Weaver ran a story Monday night about
the possibility of Ralston not returning
to Stanford next season.
Ralston's Future
Weaver pointed out the amount of
criticism Ralston had endured in the
past which was often heavy up until
last year. He mentioned the opening at
UCLA now that Tommy Prothro has
gone to the Rams. Weaver said,
"Stanford better have him pretty
firmly anchored down."
Taylor said that he has no solid
contractual arrangement for the future
with Ralston. But he did say "We'll do
everything we can to retain John and

we don't have any reason to think he
isn't going to stay." Ralston will be off
recruiting after the Hula Bowl, but
Taylor says he will have contract talks
with him when he returns.
After a year in which he has defeated
Arkansas, USC, UCLA and Ohio State,
it seems doubtful that Ralston would
want to leave. After eight years of hard
work he has finally given Stanford a
top-flight football program and with
the fine prospects he has for next year,
it would be hard to imagine him leaving
now.

some other way than retiring his
uniform. It would probably be more of
an honor to have it worn."
Since the decision regarding the
matter would most likely come down
to Taylor it is pretty certain someone
will be wearing No. 16 again in the
future.
Finally John Ralston has been in the
news quite a bit recently, and not only
in articles praising his Rose Bowl win.
KTVU-TV sports commentator Rick
Weaver ran a story Monday night about
the possibility of Ralston not returning
to Stanford next season.
Ralston's Future
Weaver pointed out the amount of
criticism Ralston had endured in the
past which was often heavy up until
last year. He mentioned the opening at
UCLA now that Tommy Prothro has
gone to the Rams. Weaver said,
"Stanford better have him pretty
firmly anchored down."
Taylor said that he has no solid
contractual arrangement for the future
with Ralston. But he did say "We'll do
everything we can to retain John and

we don't have any reason to think he
isn't going to stay." Ralston will be off
recruiting after the Hula Bowl, but
Taylor says he will have contract talks
with him when he returns.
After a year in which he has defeated
Arkansas, USC, UCLA and Ohio State,
it seems doubtful that Ralston would
want to leave. After eight years of hard
work he has finally given Stanford a
top-flight football program and with
the fine prospects he has for next year,
it would be hard to imagine him leaving
now.
Stanford's football season may have
officially ended following the Rose
Bowl, but the reliving of thai game and
quite a few other newsworthy items
will keep football in the air for awhile.
The Associated Press released its
final football poll of the season
yesterday and the Indians were ranked
eighth. Nebraska won the mythical
national championship, followed by
Notre Dame, Texas, Tennessee and
Ohio State.
Stanford's win in the Rose Bowl
lifted it from 12th place and dropped
the previously undefeated Buckeyes
from 2nd to sth, but the Cards still
remain below the five teams already
mentioned, as well as Arizona State and
Louisiana State.
Hula Bowl
While most of the players have begun
classes again, several are away
practicing for all-star games to be
played this weekend. Bob Moore, John
Sande and Jim Plunkett are in Hawaii
for the Hula Bowl. John Ralston will be
coaching the North squad in that game
which will be televised Saturday at
1 :00 p.m. on Channel 7 (KGO-TV).

Randy Vataha and Dave Tipton will
be in Tampa, Florida for the American
Bowl Game which can be seen at 11 :0U
a.m. Sunday on Channel 2 (KTVU-TV).
But both Plunkett and Ralston's
names have been in the news for more
than the Hula Bowl.
The professional football draft will
be held in New York on January 28
and it is speculated that Plunkett will
be No. 1 pick. The Boston Patriots,
who had a 2-12 season record, will get
the first choice and they will probably
take Plunkett unless they trade their
first round choice.
Whether or not Plunkett will end up
playing for the Patriots is another
question. The Pats already have a
high-priced quarterback Joe Kapp, who
failed to win for them this season. But
most observers feel their major
problem is a pathetically weak
offensive line, and it is questionalbe
that any quarterback could perform
well under the pressure Kapp was
subjected to.
Plunkett to 4 9 ers?
So naturally the possibility of
trading Plunkett has been rumored
frequently in the past few days.
Reportedly at least 11 clubs have

expressed interest in such a deal. One
such rumor had the San Francisco
4 9 ers offering defensive end Stan
Hindman, tight end Ted Kwalick and a
high draft choice for Boston's first
pick.
The 49ers have denied the offer, but
they do not deny that they have talked
to Boston. And Plunkett has said he
would like to play for the 49ers over
any other NFL club. And admidst all
these rumors there was a story coming
out of Minneapolis Monday that the
Patriots might keep Plunkett and trade
Kapp to Atlanta.
In the three and a half weeks
between now and the draft there will
undoubtedly be talk of many more
possible trades. Still, Boston with the
first pick will make the final decision.
All that is certain is that Plunkett will
wind up with a financially lucrative
contract, no matter who he plays for.
Plunkett's Jersey
Plunkett's name, or more correctly
his jersey, was in the news in another
way yesterday. According to a story in
the San Francisco Chronicle, 4 9er
promotion man and former Stanford
player, Dick Berg has started a
campaign to retire Plunkett's uniform.

When asked about this, Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor said he didn't
think it would happen. As far as he
knew only Ernie Nevers' uniform had
ever been retired and he didn't think

they do not deny that they have talked
to Boston. And Plunkett has said he
would like to play for the 49ers over
any other NFL club. And admidst all
these rumors there was a story coming
out of Minneapolis Monday that the
Patriots might keep Plunkett and trade
Kapp to Atlanta.
In the three and a half weeks
between now and the draft there will
undoubtedly be talk of many more
possible trades. Still, Boston with the
first pick will make the final decision.
All that is certain is that Plunkett will
wind up with a financially lucrative
contract, no matter who he plays for.
Plunkett's Jersey
Plunkett's name, or more correctly
his jersey, was in the news in another
way yesterday. According to a story in
the San Francisco Chronicle, 4 9er
promotion man and former Stanford
player, Dick Berg has started a
campaign to retire Plunkett's uniform.

When asked about this, Athletic
Director Chuck Taylor said he didn't
think it would happen. As far as he
knew only Ernie Nevers' uniform had
ever been retired and he didn't think

ALL-STAR CENTER—Senior center John Sande will close out his career in the
Hula Bowl this weekend in Hawaii. Sande had possibly the finest game of his
career in the Rose Bowl working against and completely dominating Ohio State's
All-American middle guard Jim Stillwagon.
Plunkett's would be. Taylor said, "It's
probably better to have him honored in
some other way than retiring his
uniform. It would probably be more of
an honor to have it worn."
Since the decision regarding the
matter would most likely come down
to Taylor it is pretty certain someone
will be wearing No. 16 again in the
future.
Finally John Ralston has been in the
news quite a bit recently, and not only
in articles praising his Rose Bowl win.
KTVU-TV sports commentator Rick
Weaver ran a story Monday night about
the possibility of Ralston not returning
to Stanford next season.
Ralston's Future
Weaver pointed out the amount of
criticism Ralston had endured in the
past which was often heavy up until
last year. He mentioned the opening at
UCLA now that Tommy Prothro has
gone to the Rams. Weaver said,
"Stanford better have him pretty
firmly anchored down."
Taylor said that he has no solid
contractual arrangement for the future
with Ralston. But he did say "We'll do
everything we can to retain John and

we don't have any reason to think he
isn't going to stay." Ralston will be off
recruiting after the Hula Bowl, but
Taylor says he will have contract talks
with him when he returns.
After a year in which he has defeated
Arkansas, USC, UCLA and Ohio State,
it seems doubtful that Ralston would
want to leave. After eight years of hard
work he has finally given Stanford a
top-flight football program and with
the fine prospects he has for next year,
it would be hard to imagine him leaving
now.
Stanford's football season may have
officially ended following the Rose
Bowl, but the reliving of thai game and
quite a few other newsworthy items
will keep football in the air for awhile.
The Associated Press released its
final football poll of the season
yesterday and the Indians were ranked
eighth. Nebraska won the mythical
national championship, followed by
Notre Dame, Texas, Tennessee and
Ohio State.
Stanford's win in the Rose Bowl
lifted it from 12th place and dropped
the previously undefeated Buckeyes
from 2nd to sth, but the Cards still
remain below the five teams already
mentioned, as well as Arizona State and
Louisiana State.
Hula Bowl
While most of the players have begun
classes again, several are away
practicing for all-star games to be
played this weekend. Bob Moore, John
Sande and Jim Plunkett are in Hawaii
for the Hula Bowl. John Ralston will be
coaching the North squad in that game
which will be televised Saturday at
1 :00 p.m. on Channel 7 (KGO-TV).

Randy Vataha and Dave Tipton will
be in Tampa, Florida for the American
Bowl Game which can be seen at 11 :0U
a.m. Sunday on Channel 2 (KTVU-TV).
But both Plunkett and Ralston's
names have been in the news for more
than the Hula Bowl.
The professional football draft will
be held in New York on January 28
and it is speculated that Plunkett will
be No. 1 pick. The Boston Patriots,
who had a 2-12 season record, will get
the first choice and they will probably
take Plunkett unless they trade their
first round choice.
Whether or not Plunkett will end up
playing for the Patriots is another
question. The Pats already have a
high-priced quarterback Joe Kapp, who
failed to win for them this season. But
most observers feel their major
problem is a pathetically weak
offensive line, and it is questionalbe
that any quarterback could perform
well under the pressure Kapp was
subjected to.
Plunkett to 4 9 ers?
So naturally the possibility of
trading Plunkett has been rumored
frequently in the past few days.
Reportedly at least 11 clubs have

expressed interest in such a deal. One
such rumor had the San Francisco
4 9 ers offering defensive end Stan
Hindman, tight end Ted Kwalick and a
high draft choice for Boston's first
pick.
The 49ers have denied the offer, but
they do not deny that they have talked
to Boston. And Plunkett has said he
would like to play for the 49ers over
any other NFL club. And admidst all
