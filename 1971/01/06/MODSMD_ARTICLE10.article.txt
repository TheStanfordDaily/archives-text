# Lyman Tells Student Senators University Survival Foremost
## 
### 
The University's survival is the issue of
highest priority before the administration,
President Richard Lyman told the Student
Senate last night.
Lyman stated the problem of survival
concerned not only money, but "the coherence
of purpose and recognition of common
purpose" by the University community.
His remarks came during a 45 minute
questioo-and-answer period which followed a
brief statement to the Senate.
In his preliminary address, Lyman called for
the Senate to organize more quickly at the
beginning of the school year. He noted that
student positions on important university
committees are still vacant due to the late
constitution of the senate this Fall. Spring
election of most of the Senate was mentioned
by Lyman as a possible solution to this
dilemma.
Incomplete Answers
Often Dr. Lyman simply stated he could not
answer, or had incomplete knowledge of a
question. He suggested that in the future
detailed questions be submitted in advance so
that he might prepare his answers.
Several senators, however, seemed annoyed
at. Lyman's failure to answer their queries. John
Shoch commented, "Is there anything else you
don't know that we should know about?"
Responsing to a question on his attitude
towards proposals for all-black dormitories, the
President stated, "I do not believe that a
dormitory should be completely occupied by
members of one ethnic group or background."
Lyman expressed his support for limited
concentrations of minority students such as
now exist in Junipero and Cedro Houses.
Second Class Citizens
The former provost echoed the concern of
one Senator that blacks were being converted
"from second class citizens into second class
students"—that society might consider college
degrees of students admitted under special
minority recruiting programs of less value than
those of white students.
Lyman called Vice-President Agnew's
accusation that colleges had lowered their
admission standards to admit disadvantaged
students "insidious." He said the University
would work to avoid the "last in-first out"

phenomenon which plagues blacks in private
industry during periods of economic decline.
"We will strive to insure that the commitments
we made three years ago will not be
diminished," he concluded.
Considerable time was devoted to discussion
of the finances of the University. President
Lyman explained that the $30 million annually
received in gifts to the University cannot
alleviate the financial bind as over two-thirds of
this sum carries restrictions for its use. Only
some $6 million goes to the general operating
budget and only 3.2 million is earmarked for
student financial aid.
When challenged to justify his acceptance of

constraints placed on the University by the
federal government, Lyman answered, "Whose
constraints would be preferrable?" He held that
the need for financial resources necessitates
federal dependence.
In other actions, five students were approved
for membership on the Committee of Fifteen.
Paul Grobstein, Lynn Karowsky, Arnie Brown,
Felicity Barringer and Osburn L. Hurston will
serve on the student-faculty-administration
committee which is primarily concerned with
the University Judicial system. However, the
Senate twice turned down nominees for the
sixth student position on the committee, and
applications will soon be available for that post.

The University's survival is the issue of
highest priority before the administration,
President Richard Lyman told the Student
Senate last night.
Lyman stated the problem of survival
concerned not only money, but "the coherence
of purpose and recognition of common
purpose" by the University community.
His remarks came during a 45 minute
questioo-and-answer period which followed a
brief statement to the Senate.
In his preliminary address, Lyman called for
the Senate to organize more quickly at the
beginning of the school year. He noted that
student positions on important university
committees are still vacant due to the late
constitution of the senate this Fall. Spring
election of most of the Senate was mentioned
by Lyman as a possible solution to this
dilemma.
Incomplete Answers
Often Dr. Lyman simply stated he could not
answer, or had incomplete knowledge of a
question. He suggested that in the future
detailed questions be submitted in advance so
that he might prepare his answers.
Several senators, however, seemed annoyed
at. Lyman's failure to answer their queries. John
Shoch commented, "Is there anything else you
don't know that we should know about?"
Responsing to a question on his attitude
towards proposals for all-black dormitories, the
President stated, "I do not believe that a
dormitory should be completely occupied by
members of one ethnic group or background."
Lyman expressed his support for limited
concentrations of minority students such as
now exist in Junipero and Cedro Houses.
Second Class Citizens
The former provost echoed the concern of
one Senator that blacks were being converted
"from second class citizens into second class
students"—that society might consider college
degrees of students admitted under special
minority recruiting programs of less value than
those of white students.
Lyman called Vice-President Agnew's
accusation that colleges had lowered their
admission standards to admit disadvantaged
students "insidious." He said the University
would work to avoid the "last in-first out"

phenomenon which plagues blacks in private
industry during periods of economic decline.
"We will strive to insure that the commitments
we made three years ago will not be
diminished," he concluded.
Considerable time was devoted to discussion
of the finances of the University. President
Lyman explained that the $30 million annually
received in gifts to the University cannot
alleviate the financial bind as over two-thirds of
this sum carries restrictions for its use. Only
some $6 million goes to the general operating
budget and only 3.2 million is earmarked for
student financial aid.
When challenged to justify his acceptance of

constraints placed on the University by the
federal government, Lyman answered, "Whose
constraints would be preferrable?" He held that
the need for financial resources necessitates
federal dependence.
In other actions, five students were approved
for membership on the Committee of Fifteen.
Paul Grobstein, Lynn Karowsky, Arnie Brown,
Felicity Barringer and Osburn L. Hurston will
serve on the student-faculty-administration
committee which is primarily concerned with
the University Judicial system. However, the
Senate twice turned down nominees for the
sixth student position on the committee, and
applications will soon be available for that post.
