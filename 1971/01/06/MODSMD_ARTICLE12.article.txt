Strike Laws Asked
WASHINGTON — President Nixon will press
vigorously for early enactment of a law to
prevent emergency strikes such as the still
threatening nationwide railroad walkout, his
labor secretary said yesterday.
"Such strikes become something like an
industrial H-bomb," said Secretary of Labor
J.I). Hodgson in announcing the White House is
putting top priority on the first new antistrike
legislation since the Taft-Hartley Act a quarter
century ago.
"They cause hardship, mass inconvenience,
danger and a threat to the nation's health and
safety," Hodgson told newsmen.
"Decisions are going to be required of the
nation whether we will enact a realistic law to
deal with national emergency disputes in the
transportation industry or limp through
repeated crises with a wornout crutch,"
Hodgson said.
Congress halted a 2 4 -hour nationwide rail
strike Dec. 10, imposing a partial 13.5 per cent
pay hike for some 500,000 workers involved.
But the special law expires March 1 and the
strike could resume if there is no settlement.
Overpricing Found
WASHINGTON — Government auditors have
found overpricing by defense contractors in
more than half of the military contracts

examined in a spot check.
Reporting the findings to Congress,
Comptroller General Elmer B. Staats said
Tuesday the overpricing stemmed from
submission by contractors of incomplete,
inaccurate and outdated cost information in
price negotiations.
Auditors of the General Accounting Office
examined 35 contracts totaling $135 million
awarded to 21 contractors in 1968.
For 18 procurements totaling $4 7 million,
the auditors found that costs billed were $1.5
million higher than the cost indicated by date
available to the contractors at the time of
negotiation. The contractors were not
identified.
The auditors said little or no overpricing was
found in the other 17 contracts totaling $88
million.
The auditors conceded the overpricing on the
contracts examined was not large in relations to
the totals involved, but said it occurred under
the same conditions that the 1 96 2 Truth in
Negotiations Act was intended to correct.
Firebombing Fails
CLAREMONT — A sprinkler system triggered
by a firebomb tossed into an ROTC classroom
at Claremont Men's College extinguished a
blaze before it could cause major damage,
authorities said yesterday.
The incendiary device was thrown through a

window early Tuesday, setting fire to drapes, a
rug and part of one wall before the sprinklers
came on, authorities said. Damage was
estimated at $1,000.
Investigators said they had no clues in the
bombing.
School officials said there have been no
demonstrations on campus since last spring.
Nerve Gas Lost
WASHINGTON — Two hundred cylinders of
deadly nerve gas were lost for three years after
the Army stored them on a frozen Alaskan lake
and they sank unnoticed during a spring thaw,
the Washington Post reported in Wednesday's
editions.
The lethal gas, one drop of which could kill a
person, had been scheduled for destruction and
fused for demolition, the Post reported.
However, the explanation for destroying the
cylinders was never given and the stockpile
eventually sank in the lake, located in a remote
portion of the Army's Gerstle River test area of
the Fort Greely military reservation.
The Post said the submerged munitions were
recovered sometime between May 6 and Aug.
27 , 1 969, after a new commander heard rumors
of the loss and ordered the lake drained.
The Army reported a post recovery
investigation of the cylinders disclosed no
evidence the gas had leaked.

the area because the fenced off region was so
remote from populated areas and tests after the
cylinders were recovered showed no leaks.
The Post said the first admission of the error
came when an Army memo detailing the
problem reportedly was slipped under doors on
Capitol Hill marked "information for members
of Congress."
Liston Found Dead
LAS VEGAS, Nev. — Former heavyweight
boxing champion Charles "Sonny" Liston was
found dead late Tuesday night in his Las Vegas
home, the Clark County Sheriff's Office said.
An investigation was launched immediately
to see if there was any foul play, deputies said.
Cause of death was not immediately known.
Investigation Asked
FRESNO — The president of Fresno State
College says he has asked the prestigious
American Association of University Professors
to investigate campus problems.
At the same time Tuesday, President Norman
Baxter announced he had chosen a veteran FSC
faculty member and a young San Diego State
college dean to fill vice presidencies on the
campus, thereby demoting one of the
administration's controversial figures.
Baxter said Dr. Horace 0. Schorling, 58,

former dean of the school of professional
studies and acting academic vice president since
July, would become the executive vice
president at the end of the current semester.
Schorling's appointment means Dr. James A.
Fikes, a controversial campus figure, is being
demoted from executive vice president. Fikes
was appointed to the position when former
acting president Karl L. Falk took over in
November 1969.
FSC has been beset by troubles ranging from
struggles between faculty factions to civil
disobedience and violence, but Baxter said the
AAI.JP study would be limited to the
governance of the campus and the policies and
procedures pertaining to it.
Separatists Charged
MONTREAL — Four bearded Quebec men
shouting separatist slogans were charged
Tuesday with the kidnaping and murder of
provincial Labor Minister Pierre Laporte.
At the same time, the Defense Department
announced the withdrawal of army troops
called up in October to assist Quebec police
after the kidnappings of Laporte and British
Trade Commissioner James Cross.
Not guilty pleas were entered in behalf of the
four, Paul Rose, 27; his brother Jacques, 23;
Francis Simard, 23, and Bernard Lortie, 19.
Trial dates will be set Thursday.
