# Senate Task Force Suggests Study Of Graduate Education
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Citing the "profound dissatisfaction" of
some graduate students with aspects of the
graduate program, a Faculty Senate task force
has recommended that a study of graduate
education be launched.
The task force suggested that such a study
focus "on certain well-defined problems and
issues in graduate education, but not sweep
broadly across all areas of graduate life."
An overall steering committee would be
requested "to examine critically Stanford's
current contributions in the larger context of
society, to consider the implications of
changing social needs for broad policies of
recruitment and training, and to question
whether our resources are being put to their
optimum use."
Noting that the University has never "carried
out a broad study of graduate education," the
report suggests that education is currently in a
transition period that "demands that we
(faculty and students) examine what we are
doing as teachers and research to become
aware of what we are doing right as well as
where we are failing."
No Major Study
Because of "present financial limitations, the
already burdensome load of committee work of
the faculty, and the very different needs of the
various graduate programs in the University,"
the task force did not recommend a "major"
study at this time.
The report decided "it most useful to stress

the 'remedial' solutions to problems
confronting graduate education because we
believe that solutions to many of them can be
found within the existing departmental
structure and University resources." It rejected
a study similar to the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) which lasted several years and
studied many topics but did not study graduate
education in detail.
SES reports have been directly responsible
for such changes in undergraduate education as
the unlimited pass-fail option and the new
grading system.
Academics Only
The task force specifically excluded "a
number of issues having to do with the general
quality of graduate student life. Housing,
questions of social interaction, opportunities
for intellectual interaction beyond the
department—all of these are serious and
important questions. However the task force
decided to "limit this study to the academic
aspects of graduate student life."
The report, currently being considered by
the Faculty Senate, recommends that a steering
committee of students and faculty be formed
to oversee the report and to identify and
articulate goals of graduate education. It also
suggested that six committees be formed to
investigate problems which might cut across a
wide variety of fields and that the steering
committee "appoint a small (three faculty and
two students) team to study any particular
department."

The topic committees would study the
following broad areas:
—Graduate student teaching, its role and
importance;
—Ph.D. dissertations and alternative degrees
including variation between departments,
different definitions of dissertation and
proposals for new degree programs;
—Financial support of graduate students;
—Methods for change of graduate curricula;
—Alternative programs including the
possibility of developing more Master's
programs;
—The assessment and reporting of students:
performance and prospects.
Committee Size
The steering committee would comprise of
no more than 10 members, including the
chairman, with at least one-third to one-half of
the members graduate students.
The group would appoint small committees
(with five members including one from the
steering committee) which would study
intensively one department and its particular
problems for about one week. The task force
suggests that members of the small visiting
committees be from departments other than
the one being studied but that "the people, or
at least the areas they represent, should be
suggested by the department to be studied."
Site Visits
An examining team would make a "site
visits" to the departments in question,
"studying in detail its whole graduate program,
and making recommendations to and the
department about ways in which the program
might change." The task force recommended
that the use of these teams be explored on a
trial basis before full-scale implementation.
The task force fears a lack of time to
conduct the study on the part of faculty
members due to constantly increasing demands
of other University affairs. It also felt that some
faculty members will object to the study
because it will investigate problems that
transcend traditional department lines.
"Many feel that the problems of graduate
education are unique to departments—that little
is gained, and much potentially lost, by taking a
more general view," the report says. But the
task force tries to avoid this problem by
designing recommendations "to take account of
differences among fields of study, while
providing avenues for integration of views from
all fields when feasible and useful."
The task force was organized in May, 1 970 ,
by the Faculty Senate "to determine the
feasibility of a major study of graduate
education." The task force report was
submitted to the Senate for its Dec. 17
meeting. Discussion began then and will
continue at the Senate's regular meeting
tomorrow.

of other University affairs. It also felt that some
faculty members will object to the study
because it will investigate problems that
transcend traditional department lines.
"Many feel that the problems of graduate
education are unique to departments—that little
is gained, and much potentially lost, by taking a
more general view," the report says. But the
task force tries to avoid this problem by
designing recommendations "to take account of
differences among fields of study, while
providing avenues for integration of views from
all fields when feasible and useful."
The task force was organized in May, 1 970 ,
by the Faculty Senate "to determine the
feasibility of a major study of graduate
education." The task force report was
submitted to the Senate for its Dec. 17
meeting. Discussion began then and will
continue at the Senate's regular meeting
tomorrow.
Citing the "profound dissatisfaction" of
some graduate students with aspects of the
graduate program, a Faculty Senate task force
has recommended that a study of graduate
education be launched.
The task force suggested that such a study
focus "on certain well-defined problems and
issues in graduate education, but not sweep
broadly across all areas of graduate life."
An overall steering committee would be
requested "to examine critically Stanford's
current contributions in the larger context of
society, to consider the implications of
changing social needs for broad policies of
recruitment and training, and to question
whether our resources are being put to their
optimum use."
Noting that the University has never "carried
out a broad study of graduate education," the
report suggests that education is currently in a
transition period that "demands that we
(faculty and students) examine what we are
doing as teachers and research to become
aware of what we are doing right as well as
where we are failing."
No Major Study
Because of "present financial limitations, the
already burdensome load of committee work of
the faculty, and the very different needs of the
various graduate programs in the University,"
the task force did not recommend a "major"
study at this time.
The report decided "it most useful to stress

the 'remedial' solutions to problems
confronting graduate education because we
believe that solutions to many of them can be
found within the existing departmental
structure and University resources." It rejected
a study similar to the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) which lasted several years and
studied many topics but did not study graduate
education in detail.
SES reports have been directly responsible
for such changes in undergraduate education as
the unlimited pass-fail option and the new
grading system.
Academics Only
The task force specifically excluded "a
number of issues having to do with the general
quality of graduate student life. Housing,
questions of social interaction, opportunities
for intellectual interaction beyond the
department—all of these are serious and
important questions. However the task force
decided to "limit this study to the academic
aspects of graduate student life."
The report, currently being considered by
the Faculty Senate, recommends that a steering
committee of students and faculty be formed
to oversee the report and to identify and
articulate goals of graduate education. It also
suggested that six committees be formed to
investigate problems which might cut across a
wide variety of fields and that the steering
committee "appoint a small (three faculty and
two students) team to study any particular
department."

The topic committees would study the
following broad areas:
—Graduate student teaching, its role and
importance;
—Ph.D. dissertations and alternative degrees
including variation between departments,
different definitions of dissertation and
proposals for new degree programs;
—Financial support of graduate students;
—Methods for change of graduate curricula;
—Alternative programs including the
possibility of developing more Master's
programs;
—The assessment and reporting of students:
performance and prospects.
Committee Size
The steering committee would comprise of
no more than 10 members, including the
chairman, with at least one-third to one-half of
the members graduate students.
The group would appoint small committees
(with five members including one from the
steering committee) which would study
intensively one department and its particular
problems for about one week. The task force
suggests that members of the small visiting
committees be from departments other than
the one being studied but that "the people, or
at least the areas they represent, should be
suggested by the department to be studied."
Site Visits
An examining team would make a "site
visits" to the departments in question,
"studying in detail its whole graduate program,
and making recommendations to and the
department about ways in which the program
might change." The task force recommended
that the use of these teams be explored on a
trial basis before full-scale implementation.
The task force fears a lack of time to
conduct the study on the part of faculty
members due to constantly increasing demands
of other University affairs. It also felt that some

(with five members including one from the
steering committee) which would study
intensively one department and its particular
problems for about one week. The task force
suggests that members of the small visiting
committees be from departments other than
the one being studied but that "the people, or
at least the areas they represent, should be
suggested by the department to be studied."
Site Visits
An examining team would make a "site
visits" to the departments in question,
"studying in detail its whole graduate program,
and making recommendations to and the
department about ways in which the program
might change." The task force recommended
that the use of these teams be explored on a
trial basis before full-scale implementation.
The task force fears a lack of time to
conduct the study on the part of faculty
members due to constantly increasing demands
of other University affairs. It also felt that some
faculty members will object to the study
because it will investigate problems that
transcend traditional department lines.
"Many feel that the problems of graduate
education are unique to departments—that little
is gained, and much potentially lost, by taking a
more general view," the report says. But the
task force tries to avoid this problem by
designing recommendations "to take account of
differences among fields of study, while
providing avenues for integration of views from
all fields when feasible and useful."
The task force was organized in May, 1 970 ,
by the Faculty Senate "to determine the
feasibility of a major study of graduate
education." The task force report was
submitted to the Senate for its Dec. 17
meeting. Discussion began then and will
continue at the Senate's regular meeting
tomorrow.
