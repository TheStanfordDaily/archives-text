# Budget Cuts May Limit Minority Admissions
## 
### FRED MANN 
University financial cutbacks will most likely
force an end to continued increases of minority
student admissions next fall.
The number of black, chicano, and American
Indian students admitted each year has risen
dramatically over the last three years, more
than tripling in that time. Next year's incoming
class, however, will probably include nearly the
same number of minority students as this
year's. No proposal for continuing the pattern
of increased admissions has reached the
President's office this year, and none is likely
to. The reason is money.
With the University currently undergoing
extreme budget trimming, financial aid to
students is not being spared. Scholarship
funding will be cut, and since most minority
students admitted require a great deal of
financial aid, the prospects of enlarging the
number of those students are very slim.
The Budget Adjustment Program (HAP) is
currently studying what cuts to make in
University expenditures over the next four
years. $ 4.1 million is expected to be cut.
Hut financial aid to minority students is not
expected to be reduced. Minority students
therefore may well receive a higher percentage
of the aid.
Current Class
The current freshman class includes 75
blacks, 75 chicanos, and 25 Indians. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions Fred A. Hargadon
expects the same ratio of minority students to
continue indefinitely.

"There will be an increase in the total
minority population next year because it will
be the fourth year of expanded black-chicano
admissions," Hargadon said. "1 was not under
the impression that there was going to be an
expansion in minority admissions beyond the
natural expansion from the growth of the
University," he added.
Response to the apparent minority
admissions slowdown has been tentative.
Assistant Dean of Students Harold K. Boyd
expressed hope that black admissions would
not be cut back.
Concern and Commitment
1 would like to think that the University has
moved from a position of total indifference to
one of concern and commitment in minority
affairs," he said. "It has established a high
degree of credibility with the minority
population. 1 would hate to see a retreat from
that point where suspicion would increase and
credibility of the institution with blacks would
decrease."
The Indian enrollment jumped from six to
25 this year, and Chris McNeil, a counselor for
native Americans in the Dean of Students
office, stated he had not expected any increase
next year. "Minority students have a very high
average need for financial aid," he said, "and
for Indians the need is extremely high."
John While of Tecumseh Mouse expressed
hope that Indian admissions will remain at the
same level next year.

minority population next year because it will
be the fourth year of expanded black-chicano
admissions," Hargadon said. "1 was not under
the impression that there was going to be an
expansion in minority admissions beyond the
natural expansion from the growth of the
University," he added.
Response to the apparent minority
admissions slowdown has been tentative.
Assistant Dean of Students Harold K. Boyd
expressed hope that black admissions would
not be cut back.
Concern and Commitment
1 would like to think that the University has
moved from a position of total indifference to
one of concern and commitment in minority
affairs," he said. "It has established a high
degree of credibility with the minority
population. 1 would hate to see a retreat from
that point where suspicion would increase and
credibility of the institution with blacks would
decrease."
The Indian enrollment jumped from six to
25 this year, and Chris McNeil, a counselor for
native Americans in the Dean of Students
office, stated he had not expected any increase
next year. "Minority students have a very high
average need for financial aid," he said, "and
for Indians the need is extremely high."
John While of Tecumseh Mouse expressed
hope that Indian admissions will remain at the
same level next year.
University financial cutbacks will most likely
force an end to continued increases of minority
student admissions next fall.
The number of black, chicano, and American
Indian students admitted each year has risen
dramatically over the last three years, more
than tripling in that time. Next year's incoming
class, however, will probably include nearly the
same number of minority students as this
year's. No proposal for continuing the pattern
of increased admissions has reached the
President's office this year, and none is likely
to. The reason is money.
With the University currently undergoing
extreme budget trimming, financial aid to
students is not being spared. Scholarship
funding will be cut, and since most minority
students admitted require a great deal of
financial aid, the prospects of enlarging the
number of those students are very slim.
The Budget Adjustment Program (HAP) is
currently studying what cuts to make in
University expenditures over the next four
years. $ 4.1 million is expected to be cut.
Hut financial aid to minority students is not
expected to be reduced. Minority students
therefore may well receive a higher percentage
of the aid.
Current Class
The current freshman class includes 75
blacks, 75 chicanos, and 25 Indians. Dean of
Undergraduate Admissions Fred A. Hargadon
expects the same ratio of minority students to
continue indefinitely.

"There will be an increase in the total
minority population next year because it will
be the fourth year of expanded black-chicano
admissions," Hargadon said. "1 was not under
the impression that there was going to be an
expansion in minority admissions beyond the
natural expansion from the growth of the
University," he added.
