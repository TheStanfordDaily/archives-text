# In Marin Shootout
## A. Davis Arraigned 
### PHIL LIND 
SAN RA FA EL—Black militant Angela Davis
pleaded innocent to charges of murder,
kidnapping, and criminal conspiracy at her
arraignment yesterday in the Marin County
Courthouse.
The former UCLA philosophy instructor
declared in her statement to the court that she
is a victim of a "political frame-up" aimed at
implicating her in the shootout last August that
took the lives of two convicts, a 1 7 year-old
accomplice, and a Superior Court judge.
"I want to declare publicly before the
court and the people of this country that I am
innocent of all charges brought against me by
the state of California. My presence in this
court is unrelated to any criminal activities. I
stand before this court as the target of a
political frame-up," she stated.
Davis also said, "If I am to be granted a fair
trial, it is imperative that I be given the right of
counsel."
Her chief counsel, Allan Brotsky of San
Francisco, made motions for bail and for
dismissing the grand jury indictments on
grounds of insufficient evidence and improper
makeup of the grand jury.
Future Trial Date
Judge Joseph Wilson told him to put them in
writing by Feb. 5 and gave the state until Feb.
22 to reply. Wilson said he would then set a
trial date after consulting the Chief Justice of
the State SuDreme Court.

Approximately 35 0 people held a support
rally outside the Marin County courthouse in
Davis' behalf. During the arraignment the
people marched in a picket line and chanted
"Free Anglea! Free Ruchell!"
"Ruehell" referred to Ruchell Magee, Davis'
co-defendent in the case. He is the only survivor
of the shootout.
During the arraignment Magee accused the
court of "railroading" him into the gas chamber
and said that he should be allowed to defend
himself. He was handcuffed, shackled, and his
chair bolted to the floor. Later Magee was
escorted out of the courtroom.
A nation-wide manhunt was initiated for
Davis when it was determined that she had
purchased a gun for Jonathan Jackson, the 17
year-old accomplice in the kidnapping of Judge
William Hailey. Jackson was Davis' bodyguard
and brother of George Jackson, one of the
three "Soledad Brothers."
The arraignment ended at noon, and as she
was escorted out of the courtroom, Davis raised
her fist to the crowd as 60 supporters in the
courtroom shouted "right on."
Proceedings Explained
Davis' family and lawyers then proceeded to
the picket line outside the building and
explained the court proceedings to the crowd.
Davis' father stated that he and his family
had visited her in jail and that "she is convinced
that the people of this country are behind her
and that the power of the people will free her
as Huey I'. Newton was freed."
A member of the National Committee to
Free Angela Davis presented a statement to the
crowd accusing the government of lying to the
people and of perpetuating racist attacks
against black people in this country.
"Nixon has invited 14 Soviet scientists to
attend Angela's trial in a courtroom with
limited seating available. Nixon claims to be
smoothing relations with the Soviet Union,
which is having its own civil turmoil, and
fighting racism in this country and yet is
preventing 14 seats from being used by the
concerned people of this country and especially
the black people," the statement read.
About a do/en Stanford students attended
the rally outside the courthouse.

accomplice, and a Superior Court judge.
"I want to declare publicly before the
court and the people of this country that I am
innocent of all charges brought against me by
the state of California. My presence in this
court is unrelated to any criminal activities. I
stand before this court as the target of a
political frame-up," she stated.
Davis also said, "If I am to be granted a fair
trial, it is imperative that I be given the right of
counsel."
Her chief counsel, Allan Brotsky of San
Francisco, made motions for bail and for
dismissing the grand jury indictments on
grounds of insufficient evidence and improper
makeup of the grand jury.
Future Trial Date
Judge Joseph Wilson told him to put them in
writing by Feb. 5 and gave the state until Feb.
22 to reply. Wilson said he would then set a
trial date after consulting the Chief Justice of
the State SuDreme Court.

Approximately 35 0 people held a support
rally outside the Marin County courthouse in
Davis' behalf. During the arraignment the
people marched in a picket line and chanted
"Free Anglea! Free Ruchell!"
"Ruehell" referred to Ruchell Magee, Davis'
co-defendent in the case. He is the only survivor
of the shootout.
During the arraignment Magee accused the
court of "railroading" him into the gas chamber
and said that he should be allowed to defend
himself. He was handcuffed, shackled, and his
chair bolted to the floor. Later Magee was
escorted out of the courtroom.
A nation-wide manhunt was initiated for
Davis when it was determined that she had
purchased a gun for Jonathan Jackson, the 17
year-old accomplice in the kidnapping of Judge
William Hailey. Jackson was Davis' bodyguard
and brother of George Jackson, one of the
three "Soledad Brothers."
The arraignment ended at noon, and as she
was escorted out of the courtroom, Davis raised
her fist to the crowd as 60 supporters in the
courtroom shouted "right on."
Proceedings Explained
Davis' family and lawyers then proceeded to
the picket line outside the building and
explained the court proceedings to the crowd.
Davis' father stated that he and his family
had visited her in jail and that "she is convinced
that the people of this country are behind her
and that the power of the people will free her
as Huey I'. Newton was freed."
A member of the National Committee to
Free Angela Davis presented a statement to the
crowd accusing the government of lying to the
people and of perpetuating racist attacks
against black people in this country.
"Nixon has invited 14 Soviet scientists to
attend Angela's trial in a courtroom with
limited seating available. Nixon claims to be
smoothing relations with the Soviet Union,
which is having its own civil turmoil, and
fighting racism in this country and yet is
preventing 14 seats from being used by the
concerned people of this country and especially
the black people," the statement read.
About a do/en Stanford students attended
the rally outside the courthouse.
