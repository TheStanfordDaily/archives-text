On Jan. 6, 1949, twenty-two years ago today, Frank Sinatra said, "Nearly
all the songs / hear these days are the lousiest pile of trash / have ever
listened to. "
Frank had obviously not yet heard some of his later cuts or those of his
charming daughter Nancy.
There's a Daily staff luncheon today. We're going to try something
different today. Everyone's going to sit around during the meal and compose
classical organ music so we can have Bach's lunches.
