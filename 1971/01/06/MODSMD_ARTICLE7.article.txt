# Racy Restoration Comedy
## Witty 'Relapse' At A.C.T. 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Early last month, just in time
('or dead week, ACT opened its
'•oducnon of John Vanbrugh's
. iii)G story of naughty doings in
the horsy set, "The Relapse." It
would have been the perfect thing
to see after your last final, and
I'm sorry we couldn't get the
word out sooner. However, it's
si ill pretty good for after your last
midterm (or before it, for that
matter). Especially if you've ever
had to read Restoration Theater.
Once upon a time I did, and it was
very disheartening. On paper, in
a musty old book with narrow
columns and small type,
Restoration Theater is dreadful
stuff.
That's why you should see
"The Relapse." It is remarkable
how dull, dreary Restoration wit
magically becomes bright, witty,
slightly raunchy comedy on stage.
Director Edward Hastings has
taken John Vanbrugh's bedroom
farce, dressed the actors in

beautiful, colorful, and elaborate
period costumes, placed them in
front of simple and effective sets,
and then played it as broadly as
possible.
1 don't know how "authentic"
Mr. Hastings' staging is. For
instance, I'm not sure that the
audience of 169 6 would have
appreciated his treatment of
young Miss Hoyden, a fifteen-year
old country girl who is kept
locked in her room by her careful
father, and who in this production
uses a rocking horse to relieve her
overwrought libido. That may not
have appeared in the 1696
production (maybe it did), but
I'm sure the spirit was the same.
The cast is excellent, and seems
to have a fine time horsing
around. Ken Ruta, who is an
incredibly versatile actor, plays
Lord Foppington, a nice enough
fellow witii one major fault: He is
a rich, egotistical, pompous ass.
Mr. Ruta cavorts about the stage

looking like Bozo the Clown,
speaking in a whiney falsetto and
gesturing with his hanky in a way
that could get a guy in a lot of
trouble off stage.
Mark Bramhall plays his
somewhat shabby, swash-buckling
brother Fashion with suitable
dash and daring. With the help of
his faithful servant Lory (Martin
Berrcian), and the wheezing and
lecherous Coupler (Jay Doyle), he
manages to cheat Lord
Foppington out of his child-bride
Hoyden (Deborah Sussel) and the
rich inheritance that comes with
it.
Protecting Miss Hoyden's virtue
are her father, Sir Tunbelly
Clumsy (William Paterson), a
country gentleman who looks like
he sleeps and eats with the
livestock, and a small army of
servants, all of whom are slightly
stupid and perpetually drunk.
In the parallel plot, we find
Loveless (Scott Thomas) and his
wife Amanda (Suzanne Collins)
visiting London on business.
Loveless suffers the relapse of the
title when he abandons his quiet,
domestic life for some bedroom
intrigue with his wife's cousin, the
chic, sophisticated, and
more-than-willing Berinthia
(Michael Learned). Berinthia
keeps Amanda busy by unleashing
on her Mr. Worthy (Robert
Fletcher), who is also quite
willing.
And so they go at it, for two
hours, jumping from bedroom to
bedroom, closet to closet, stealing
bridges, stealing laughs, stealing
away. It's all a lot of fun, and if
the dresses had been cut just a bit
lower (as in "Tom .lones"), it
could have been even more fun.


Et lIEE—Lord Foppington and two jolly lasses enjoy a couple of dirty elephant jokes in this scene from
The Relapse,'' now playing at the A.C.T.
