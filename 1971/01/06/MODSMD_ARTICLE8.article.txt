# Bessie Smith: The Real Blues
## 
### ELYE L. PITTS 
Someplace James Baldwin
spoke of arming himself with a
typewriter and two Bessie Smith
records and attempting to
re-create the life that he had first
known as a child. He stated: "It
was Bessie Smith, through her
tone and her cadence, who helped
me to dig back to the way I
myself must have spoken when I
was a pickaninny, and to
remember the things I had heard
and seen and felt. 1 had buried
them very deep."
Columbia Records has
embarked on an ambitious re-issue
campaign including all of Bessie
Smith's recordings that will give
many the essence of real contact
with her true artistry. There have
been many descriptions of Bessie;
complex, coarse, earthy,
emotional, hostile. Yet no one has
accurately related the emotional
effect of the Empress upon her
audience. Influenced and trained
by the greatest of all blues singers,
Ma Rainey, Bessie was touring
with minstrels and vaudeville from
age eleven. From that period and
well into her future, life was
glorious and filled with the throes
of pleasures and pains.

Ethel Waters offered
recollections of Bessie's enigmatic
personality and how she refused
to share the stage with other blues
singers, unless they sang nonblues
material. Nevertheless, the second
of the five two record sets
comprising the legacy of the lady
includes two duets with Clara
Smith who is generally considered
to be one of her greatest rivals.
"Far Away Blues" and "I'm
Going Back To My Used To Be"
displays the sharp contrasts
between the two performers. "A
good man is hard to
find" . . . "You going
back?" ... "I'm going back to my
used to be cause my man was so
good to me." From this sweet
interchange Bessie growls back,
"Look out there Clara. You know
your man was in the poor house!"
Blues, under Miss Smith and
the twenties, was witnessing one
of many transformations,
including the one from folk to
urbanization; as was much of the
black population. Through the
years she frequently returned to
the south and her hometown,
Chattanooga, to expand her
repertoire and for 'rejuvenation'
as she called it. Initially she

suffered no lose of audience by
remodeling the blues. It was at
this time that she turned from
love and sexual themes to
interludes concerning migration,
sickness, and death. In
"Graveyard Dream Blues,"
"Cemetery Blues," and "Nobody
Knows You When You're Down
and Out," her flirtations with
these subjects are grim but the
circumstances common among her
buyers. Her appeal to white
audiences was notably lacking
when compared to Ethel Waters
and Florence Mills. However, it
was known that Bessie had no
inclinations to playing the 'white
time' and like many black singers
of her time rather resented whites
as a whole.
Throughout this second reissue
with either Fletcher Henderson,
James P. Johnson (her favorite),
or Jimmy Jones on piano, Bessie
makes the songs valid expressions
of her own emotions. In
"Jailhouse Blues" the lyrics were
trite and commonplace. "Lord!
This house is gon get raided. Yes
Sir! Good Morning Blues. Blues
how do you do? I just come here
to have a few words with you."
Bessie raises this above the

mediocrity of the context. As a
precursor to Billie Holiday, Dinah
Washington, and maybe even Nina
Simone, Miss Smith, in all
likelihood, would not have been
as great an artist if her
experiences, too, had not been so
bitter; the bitterest being her
untimely death.
In September 1937, after
having survived the earlier
reorientation of her audience to
more urban and sophisticated
tastes, Bessie was doing the
one-night circuit. There are
conflicting reports regarding the
fatal automobile accident.
Regardless, one can be assured
that racism, a la Clarksdale,
Mississippi, contributed to her
rapid departure.
Columbia's project, each priced
at $5.98 and containing 32 songs,
is timed perfectly. For sure blues
dominate the pop music scene
today but 1 recall once being told,
and 1 received it rather insultingly,
to 'go drink wine and listen to
Bessie Smtih.' I, among many, had
never listened to her but, as
Baldwin points out, "she helped
me to reconcile a new sense of
life's possibilities."

age eleven. From that period and
well into her future, life was
glorious and filled with the throes
of pleasures and pains.

Ethel Waters offered
recollections of Bessie's enigmatic
personality and how she refused
to share the stage with other blues
singers, unless they sang nonblues
material. Nevertheless, the second
of the five two record sets
comprising the legacy of the lady
includes two duets with Clara
Smith who is generally considered
to be one of her greatest rivals.
"Far Away Blues" and "I'm
Going Back To My Used To Be"
displays the sharp contrasts
between the two performers. "A
good man is hard to
find" . . . "You going
back?" ... "I'm going back to my
used to be cause my man was so
good to me." From this sweet
interchange Bessie growls back,
"Look out there Clara. You know
your man was in the poor house!"
Blues, under Miss Smith and
the twenties, was witnessing one
of many transformations,
including the one from folk to
urbanization; as was much of the
black population. Through the
years she frequently returned to
the south and her hometown,
Chattanooga, to expand her
repertoire and for 'rejuvenation'
as she called it. Initially she

suffered no lose of audience by
remodeling the blues. It was at
this time that she turned from
love and sexual themes to
interludes concerning migration,
sickness, and death. In
"Graveyard Dream Blues,"
"Cemetery Blues," and "Nobody
Knows You When You're Down
and Out," her flirtations with
these subjects are grim but the
circumstances common among her
buyers. Her appeal to white
audiences was notably lacking
when compared to Ethel Waters
and Florence Mills. However, it
was known that Bessie had no
inclinations to playing the 'white
time' and like many black singers
of her time rather resented whites
as a whole.
Throughout this second reissue
with either Fletcher Henderson,
James P. Johnson (her favorite),
or Jimmy Jones on piano, Bessie
makes the songs valid expressions
of her own emotions. In
"Jailhouse Blues" the lyrics were
trite and commonplace. "Lord!
This house is gon get raided. Yes
Sir! Good Morning Blues. Blues
how do you do? I just come here
to have a few words with you."
Bessie raises this above the

mediocrity of the context. As a
precursor to Billie Holiday, Dinah
Washington, and maybe even Nina
Simone, Miss Smith, in all
likelihood, would not have been
as great an artist if her
experiences, too, had not been so
bitter; the bitterest being her
untimely death.
In September 1937, after
having survived the earlier
reorientation of her audience to
more urban and sophisticated
tastes, Bessie was doing the
one-night circuit. There are
conflicting reports regarding the
fatal automobile accident.
Regardless, one can be assured
that racism, a la Clarksdale,
Mississippi, contributed to her
rapid departure.
Columbia's project, each priced
at $5.98 and containing 32 songs,
is timed perfectly. For sure blues
dominate the pop music scene
today but 1 recall once being told,
and 1 received it rather insultingly,
to 'go drink wine and listen to
Bessie Smtih.' I, among many, had
never listened to her but, as
Baldwin points out, "she helped
me to reconcile a new sense of
life's possibilities."
Someplace James Baldwin
spoke of arming himself with a
typewriter and two Bessie Smith
records and attempting to
re-create the life that he had first
known as a child. He stated: "It
was Bessie Smith, through her
tone and her cadence, who helped
me to dig back to the way I
myself must have spoken when I
was a pickaninny, and to
remember the things I had heard
and seen and felt. 1 had buried
them very deep."
Columbia Records has
embarked on an ambitious re-issue
campaign including all of Bessie
Smith's recordings that will give
many the essence of real contact
with her true artistry. There have
been many descriptions of Bessie;
complex, coarse, earthy,
emotional, hostile. Yet no one has
accurately related the emotional
effect of the Empress upon her
audience. Influenced and trained
by the greatest of all blues singers,
Ma Rainey, Bessie was touring
with minstrels and vaudeville from
age eleven. From that period and
well into her future, life was
glorious and filled with the throes
of pleasures and pains.
