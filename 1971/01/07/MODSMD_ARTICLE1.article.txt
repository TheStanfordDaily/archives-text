# Changes Indicate New Emphasis On Undergrad Education
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Eor the past twenty years, a common complaint of
undergraduate students in major universities has been
the trend toward development of excellent graduate
programs, sometimes to the disadvantage of the lowly
undergrad. And it is true, as the recent A.C.E. report
points out, that the reputation of a major university
is primarily a function of the eminence— whatever
that may be— of its graduate program.
But the pendulum may now be swinging the other
way. Innovations is undergraduate education are the
order of the day; where research and publication were
highly regarded in faculty evaluation, a new emphasis
is given to the less tangible, but (to the student) more
significant, teaching ability. Faculties and
administrations seem to be undergoing a general shift
of attention to undergraduate affairs.
It's happening at Michigan State, where several
small "colleges"— one with a scientific-ecological
emphass, one with the emphasis on public affairs and
administration have been formed within the greater
university.
It's happening at the University of California,
where President Charles Hitch recently called for
"renewed attention to the quality of programs for
undergraduates . . . (and) greater commitment of
faculty of all ranks to the instruction of
undergraduate students," including increased contact
between freshman and faculty members, and an
increase in "evaluation and documentation of
teaching performance."
And it's happening here.
As a matter of fact, it's been happening here for
quite some time now.
The major impetus was created by the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES), which was completed

some two years ago. SES called for precisely the
undergraduate emphasis that is being proposed
everywhere now; it recommended the expansion of
the freshman seminar program, increased evaluation
of teaching, inter—and extra-departmental programs,
and several hundred other changes and innovations.
Indeed, the problem of the new Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies (another SES-inspired
innovation) is not so much to come up with new
ideas, but to carry out those proposed in the SES
report.
Says Dean James Gibbs, "Stanford Ls well along in
this process because of SES— the spirit of SES is
quite pervasive around here . . . but it's going to take
a while before the full influence is felt."
The freshman seminar program, which has this year
been expanded to include 8 3 seminars, 38 full

professors, and nearly two-thirds of the freshman
class, is only one of many examples of innovation and
development in the undergraduate program.
Extradepartmenta! programs, like Urban Studies,
are developing; more are likely to come. Among the
possibilities is a program of studio courses, a
response, says Dean Gibbs, to the "shifting interest of
undergraduates from engineering to creative
pursuits."
An "Academic Information Center," geared
directly to the needs of undergraduates, hits been
established on the third floor of the Old Union; it
carries information on Stanford programs and
requirements, as well a& on undergraduate and
graduate study elsewhere.

"Stanford Quarterly Review," a journal of
undergraduate research, has been organized, and will
publish its first issue at the end of this quarter.
(Papers may be submitted to the Office of the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.)
Now under study is the possibility of opening one
or several new non-European overseas campuses in
Africa, the Caribbean, or the Far East, under a new
system under which students would enroll in a
foreign university for a full academic year.
Perhaps most significant are the new efforts to
recognize teaching ability as a major criterion for
decisions on faculty promotion and tenure. Now in
planning are evaluations of graduate student teaching;
increased use of student evaluations of teaching; and
the awarding of several prizes in recognition of
superior teaching ability. "There is still a need, at the
undergraduate level, for much more close contact
between students and professors," President Lyman
noted during a residence hall visit last month.
The problem, as one faculty member put it, may
lie with the professors themselves. "Most faculty do
not believe teaching is a primary function ... Very
few faculty agree with the glib distinction between
research and teaching."
And also the question of teaching versus research
remains unsolved. So, of course, does that of the
extent of this undergraduate emphasis. "We've taken
it to a point," said Lyman, "to where the graduate
education here is comparatively in a chaos."
The Dean of Undergraduate Studies, however, will
continue to serve as "an advocate for undergraduate
education in the councils of the University."
In a sense, Dean Gibbs is pleased by the challenge:
"I'm a Dean without a school", he said, "so we have
to be persuasive."
