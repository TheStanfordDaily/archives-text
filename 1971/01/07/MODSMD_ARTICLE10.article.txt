## Pac-8 Season Begins 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford opens its 1971 Pac-8
basketball season on the road this
weekend with games tomorrow
night at Oregon and Saturday
night at Oregon State. The Indians
will be facing another extremely
tough league schedule as they try
to improve on last year's 2-12
record and last place finish.
Last Saturday night the Cards
raised their non-conference record
to 4-6 with an 85 -76 win over
Columbia. Claude Terry and Mike
Michel each had twenty points to
pace the Tribe.
The Indians opened the season
with a win over USF, but they
then lost three straight, two to
Brigham Young, 70-62 and 85-64,
and one to Princeton, 81-76.
After beating Temple 7 3-64 , the
Cards were bombed by
nationally-ranked Villanova
96-76 .
Far West Classic
Then on the last weekend in
December, Stanford finished sixth
in a field of eight at the Far West
Classic in Portland. They beat
Ohio State 78 -74 in overtime, but

then lost to both Oregon State
and Washington State.
So far this season Stanford has
been paced by junior guard
Claude Terry who is scoring at a
1 7.3 clip and senior center Mike
Michel who is averaging 12.9
points. Terry was slowed early in
the season by a pulled groin
muscle, but is now at full speed
and was named to the All Far
West Tournament Team. Michel is
also averaging 7.2 rebounds, but
sophomore forward Pat Stevens is
close behind with a 6.9 figure.
In this weekend's games, Coach
Howie Dallmar will probably go
with Terry (6-5) and Dennis
O'Neill (6-2 1/2) at the guards,
Stevens (6-4 1/2) and Chuck
Moore (6-4) at the forwards, and
Michel (6-6) at center.
Sophomore Subs
Other players sure to see action
include sophomore guard John
Stratton (6-2), and sophomore
swing man Pat Rusco (6-4). 6-5
sophomore forward, Bob Buell,
who had averaged 5 .2 points and
5.7 rebounds since he returned to
the lineup against Princeton,

reinjured his ankle in the Far West
Classic and is doubtful for this
weekend.
6-10 center Larry Rosenzweig
who has been out all season with a
knee injury' may be able to play
some next weekend when UCLA
and USC come to town.
Both Oregon and Oregon State
enter this weekend's games with
7-2 records. Oregon has lost to
Houston and Oregon State, while
the Beavers have been defeated by
Kentucky and Tennessee.
Oregon is led by 6-9 center
Stan Love who led the Pac-8 in
scoring last season with a 20.8
average. Rusty Blair at 6-9 and
Larry Holliday, an outstanding
6-3 jumper will probably give the
small Indians problems on the
boards.
Oregon State
Oregon State is led by guard
Freddy Boyd, who was the most
valuable player in the Far West
Classic. Under first year coach
Ralph Miller, the Beavers have
abandoned their old slowdown
style and adopted more of a
running game.
Gary Arbelbide (6-7) and Neal
Jurgenson (6-9) give the Beavers
good height in their starting
lineup, and 6-6 substitute Sam
Whitehead, who scored 23 points
in their 8 2-75 win over Stanford,
adds fine depth.
Stanford's undefeated (3-0)
freshman team travels to Southern
California for two games this
weekend. They play Hancock
Junior College in Santa Maria and
Cuesta College in San Luis
Obispo.
So far this season, the Papooses
hold wins over USF Frosh, Laney
Junior College, and the Cal
Medical Center. The team has
been led so far by the play of 6-8
center Mike Mann and 6-7
forward Jim Helbush.

Whitehead, who scored 23 points
in their 8 2-75 win over Stanford,
adds fine depth.

So far this season, the Papooses
hold wins over USF Frosh, Laney
Junior College, and the Cal
Medical Center. The team has
been led so far by the play of 6-8
center Mike Mann and 6-7
forward Jim Helbush.
Stanford opens its 1971 Pac-8
basketball season on the road this

raised their non-conference record
to 4-6 with an 85 -76 win over

in a field of eight at the Far West

then lost to both Oregon State
and Washington State.
So far this season Stanford has
been paced by junior guard
Claude Terry who is scoring at a
1 7.3 clip and senior center Mike
Michel who is averaging 12.9
points. Terry was slowed early in
the season by a pulled groin
muscle, but is now at full speed
and was named to the All Far
West Tournament Team. Michel is
also averaging 7.2 rebounds, but
sophomore forward Pat Stevens is
close behind with a 6.9 figure.
In this weekend's games, Coach
Howie Dallmar will probably go
with Terry (6-5) and Dennis
O'Neill (6-2 1/2) at the guards,
Stevens (6-4 1/2) and Chuck
Moore (6-4) at the forwards, and
Michel (6-6) at center.

Houston and Oregon State, while
the Beavers have been defeated by

Oregon is led by 6-9 center
Stan Love who led the Pac-8 in

average. Rusty Blair at 6-9 and
Larry Holliday, an outstanding
6-3 jumper will probably give the
small Indians problems on the
boards.

Freddy Boyd, who was the most
valuable player in the Far West
Classic. Under first year coach
Ralph Miller, the Beavers have
abandoned their old slowdown
style and adopted more of a

Jurgenson (6-9) give the Beavers
good height in their starting
