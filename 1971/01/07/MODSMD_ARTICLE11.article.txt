Army Admits Error
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Army's Alaskan
Command confirmed yesterday that 20 0 munitions
and storage cylinders containing a deadly nerve gas
agent sank into a small lake at Ft. Greely, Alaska, in
the spring of 1 96 6.
A command spokesman said the containers were
recovered from the lake in 1969 and destroyed after
the nerve agent was neutralized.
The sinking of the gas was reported Wednesday by
the Washington Post. The newspaper reported the
chemical was so powerful that one drop placed on the
skin would kill a person.
The Alaskan Command's public information
officer, David O'Connor, said the command
announced the loss and recovery last year. But at that
time, it identified the material as "chemical
munitions and agents," O'Connor said.
He added that the nerve agent was in Alaska as part
of a long-term surveillance program of Army material
in the arctic environment.
He said that after a five-year observation period,
the nerve gas, in munitions and storage cylinders,
was placed on a small frozen lake and prepared for
destruction. The lake is in the Gerstle River area of
Ft. Greely.
O'Connor said the disposal operation was delayed
for unknown reason and when the ice thawed, the
material sank to the bottom of the lake.
Lockheed Sues Over C-5A
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Aircraft Corp. said
yesterday it will litigate its C-5 4 contract dispute with
the Pentagon in hope of gaining a better financial
settlement than the government has offered.
Daniel J. Haughton, board chairman of the nation's
largest defense contracting firm, described as an
"excessive and unwarranted penalty" the
government's proposal which would involve company

acceptance of a $200 million fixed loss on the
contract.
"We have a strong legal position which should
ultimately result in a finding substantially more
favorable than the proposed fixed loss," Haughton
said.
"1 think we will get enough to pay the lawyers and
have something left over for the stockholder."
Speaking at a news conference, Haughton
estimated it will take between two and five years to
settle the case through litigation.
The company plans to go first to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals, and, if a
favorable decision isn't forthcoming there, to the U.S.
Court of Claims and possibly the Supreme Court.
Deputy Secretary of Defense David M. Packard
said he would have to review the company's decision
and planned to discuss it with key congressional
committees before deciding on a final course of
action.
Riles Overhauls Staff
SACRAMENTO — Wilson Riles, California's new
superintendent of public instruction, moved quickly
to consolidate control over the State Department of
Education yesterday, announcing demotions or
re-assignments for six top officials.
And he named three long-time department officials
to top interim appointments.
The announcement came 48 hours after Riles took
over from Max Rafferty, whom he defeated Nov. 3.
Riles said Everett T. Calvert, a controversial deputy
superintendent under Rafferty, will keep his title
only because he has a four-year contract granted by
the State Board of Education. Calvert's annual salary
of $29,000 will be cut to less than $20 ,000 and he
will be given "duties as designated," Riles said.
Calvert would no longer have a policy making role,
the new superintendent added at his first news
conference since becoming superintendent.
Edwin Klotz, who also served as a deputy

superintendent, will be demoted to a civil service
position as a consultant to the Bureau of National
Defense Education in the Department of Education.
Riles said the jobs of George Gustafson as special
consultant in education innovation, Collier
McDermon as assistant in charge of the Los Angeles
office and Waif Ogelsby as special assistant will also
be terminated, although they may remain in the
department in civil service positions.
Eugene Gonzales, who served as acting deputy
state superintendent for programs and legislation, wiil
return to his former job as associate superintendent
and chief of the division of instruction.
Pot To Burn
SAIGON — The U.S. Command ordered American
forces yesterday to search out marijuana fields in
South Vietnam and turn them over to South
Vietnamese troops for burning. The idea is to cut
down the growing use of pot by Gls.
The United States has agreed to pay South
Vietnam just under a cent for each marijuana plant
destroyed.
The plan calls on U.S. field commanders to
conduct continuous ground and air searches for
marijuana fields and, once they are located, to turn
them over to the South Vietnamese for burning.
The offensive was launched with a new directive
from Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander of U.S.
forces in Vietnam, to subordinate commanders. It
calls for suppression programs to fight abuse of all
drugs not just marijuana, although this is by far the
biggest cause for concern.
The command directive acknowledged publically
for the first time the extent of its drug problem.
The directive noted a sharp rise in G.I. drug
violations over the past five years—figures that
increased steadily, even in the past 18 months, when
the number of Americans here decreased by some
200,000 men.

Army Admits Error
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Army's Alaskan
Command confirmed yesterday that 20 0 munitions
and storage cylinders containing a deadly nerve gas
agent sank into a small lake at Ft. Greely, Alaska, in
the spring of 1 96 6.
A command spokesman said the containers were
recovered from the lake in 1969 and destroyed after
the nerve agent was neutralized.
The sinking of the gas was reported Wednesday by
the Washington Post. The newspaper reported the
chemical was so powerful that one drop placed on the
skin would kill a person.
The Alaskan Command's public information
officer, David O'Connor, said the command
announced the loss and recovery last year. But at that
time, it identified the material as "chemical
munitions and agents," O'Connor said.
He added that the nerve agent was in Alaska as part
of a long-term surveillance program of Army material
in the arctic environment.
He said that after a five-year observation period,
the nerve gas, in munitions and storage cylinders,
was placed on a small frozen lake and prepared for
destruction. The lake is in the Gerstle River area of
Ft. Greely.
O'Connor said the disposal operation was delayed
for unknown reason and when the ice thawed, the
material sank to the bottom of the lake.
Lockheed Sues Over C-5A
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Aircraft Corp. said
yesterday it will litigate its C-5 4 contract dispute with
the Pentagon in hope of gaining a better financial
settlement than the government has offered.
Daniel J. Haughton, board chairman of the nation's
largest defense contracting firm, described as an
"excessive and unwarranted penalty" the
government's proposal which would involve company

acceptance of a $200 million fixed loss on the
contract.
"We have a strong legal position which should
ultimately result in a finding substantially more
favorable than the proposed fixed loss," Haughton
said.
"1 think we will get enough to pay the lawyers and
have something left over for the stockholder."
Speaking at a news conference, Haughton
estimated it will take between two and five years to
settle the case through litigation.
The company plans to go first to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals, and, if a
favorable decision isn't forthcoming there, to the U.S.
Court of Claims and possibly the Supreme Court.
Deputy Secretary of Defense David M. Packard
said he would have to review the company's decision
and planned to discuss it with key congressional
committees before deciding on a final course of
action.
Riles Overhauls Staff
SACRAMENTO — Wilson Riles, California's new
superintendent of public instruction, moved quickly
to consolidate control over the State Department of
Education yesterday, announcing demotions or
re-assignments for six top officials.
And he named three long-time department officials
to top interim appointments.
The announcement came 48 hours after Riles took
over from Max Rafferty, whom he defeated Nov. 3.
Riles said Everett T. Calvert, a controversial deputy
superintendent under Rafferty, will keep his title
only because he has a four-year contract granted by
the State Board of Education. Calvert's annual salary
of $29,000 will be cut to less than $20 ,000 and he
will be given "duties as designated," Riles said.
Calvert would no longer have a policy making role,
the new superintendent added at his first news
conference since becoming superintendent.
Edwin Klotz, who also served as a deputy

superintendent, will be demoted to a civil service
position as a consultant to the Bureau of National
Defense Education in the Department of Education.
Riles said the jobs of George Gustafson as special
consultant in education innovation, Collier
McDermon as assistant in charge of the Los Angeles
office and Waif Ogelsby as special assistant will also
be terminated, although they may remain in the
department in civil service positions.
Eugene Gonzales, who served as acting deputy
state superintendent for programs and legislation, wiil
return to his former job as associate superintendent
and chief of the division of instruction.
Pot To Burn
SAIGON — The U.S. Command ordered American
forces yesterday to search out marijuana fields in
South Vietnam and turn them over to South
Vietnamese troops for burning. The idea is to cut
down the growing use of pot by Gls.
The United States has agreed to pay South
Vietnam just under a cent for each marijuana plant
destroyed.
The plan calls on U.S. field commanders to
conduct continuous ground and air searches for
marijuana fields and, once they are located, to turn
them over to the South Vietnamese for burning.
The offensive was launched with a new directive
from Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander of U.S.
forces in Vietnam, to subordinate commanders. It
calls for suppression programs to fight abuse of all
drugs not just marijuana, although this is by far the
biggest cause for concern.
The command directive acknowledged publically
for the first time the extent of its drug problem.
The directive noted a sharp rise in G.I. drug
violations over the past five years—figures that
increased steadily, even in the past 18 months, when
the number of Americans here decreased by some

them over to the South Vietnamese for burning.
The offensive was launched with a new directive
from Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander of U.S.
forces in Vietnam, to subordinate commanders. It
calls for suppression programs to fight abuse of all
drugs not just marijuana, although this is by far the
biggest cause for concern.
The command directive acknowledged publically
for the first time the extent of its drug problem.
The directive noted a sharp rise in G.I. drug
violations over the past five years—figures that
increased steadily, even in the past 18 months, when
the number of Americans here decreased by some
200,000 men.

A CALM MOMENT—Two strollers pause on the banks of Lagunita to enjoy the scenery as the last afternoon sun paints long shadows on
newly-green hillsides. Early rains filled the lake about a month sooner than usual this year, covering over summer vegetation and bonfire
skeletons. Serenity is hard to find at the beginning of the quarter. Visit Lake I^ag.
Army Admits Error
ANCHORAGE, Alaska — The Army's Alaskan
Command confirmed yesterday that 20 0 munitions
and storage cylinders containing a deadly nerve gas
agent sank into a small lake at Ft. Greely, Alaska, in
the spring of 1 96 6.
A command spokesman said the containers were
recovered from the lake in 1969 and destroyed after
the nerve agent was neutralized.
The sinking of the gas was reported Wednesday by
the Washington Post. The newspaper reported the
chemical was so powerful that one drop placed on the
skin would kill a person.
The Alaskan Command's public information
officer, David O'Connor, said the command
announced the loss and recovery last year. But at that
time, it identified the material as "chemical
munitions and agents," O'Connor said.
He added that the nerve agent was in Alaska as part
of a long-term surveillance program of Army material
in the arctic environment.
He said that after a five-year observation period,
the nerve gas, in munitions and storage cylinders,
was placed on a small frozen lake and prepared for
destruction. The lake is in the Gerstle River area of
Ft. Greely.
O'Connor said the disposal operation was delayed
for unknown reason and when the ice thawed, the
material sank to the bottom of the lake.
Lockheed Sues Over C-5A
WASHINGTON — Lockheed Aircraft Corp. said
yesterday it will litigate its C-5 4 contract dispute with
the Pentagon in hope of gaining a better financial
settlement than the government has offered.
Daniel J. Haughton, board chairman of the nation's
largest defense contracting firm, described as an
"excessive and unwarranted penalty" the
government's proposal which would involve company

acceptance of a $200 million fixed loss on the
contract.
"We have a strong legal position which should
ultimately result in a finding substantially more
favorable than the proposed fixed loss," Haughton
said.
"1 think we will get enough to pay the lawyers and
have something left over for the stockholder."
Speaking at a news conference, Haughton
estimated it will take between two and five years to
settle the case through litigation.
The company plans to go first to the Armed
Services Board of Contract Appeals, and, if a
favorable decision isn't forthcoming there, to the U.S.
Court of Claims and possibly the Supreme Court.
Deputy Secretary of Defense David M. Packard
said he would have to review the company's decision
and planned to discuss it with key congressional
committees before deciding on a final course of
action.
Riles Overhauls Staff
SACRAMENTO — Wilson Riles, California's new
superintendent of public instruction, moved quickly
to consolidate control over the State Department of
Education yesterday, announcing demotions or
re-assignments for six top officials.
And he named three long-time department officials
to top interim appointments.
The announcement came 48 hours after Riles took
over from Max Rafferty, whom he defeated Nov. 3.
Riles said Everett T. Calvert, a controversial deputy
superintendent under Rafferty, will keep his title
only because he has a four-year contract granted by
the State Board of Education. Calvert's annual salary
of $29,000 will be cut to less than $20 ,000 and he
will be given "duties as designated," Riles said.
Calvert would no longer have a policy making role,
the new superintendent added at his first news
conference since becoming superintendent.
Edwin Klotz, who also served as a deputy

superintendent, will be demoted to a civil service
position as a consultant to the Bureau of National
Defense Education in the Department of Education.
Riles said the jobs of George Gustafson as special
consultant in education innovation, Collier
McDermon as assistant in charge of the Los Angeles
office and Waif Ogelsby as special assistant will also
be terminated, although they may remain in the
department in civil service positions.
Eugene Gonzales, who served as acting deputy
state superintendent for programs and legislation, wiil
return to his former job as associate superintendent
and chief of the division of instruction.
Pot To Burn
SAIGON — The U.S. Command ordered American
forces yesterday to search out marijuana fields in
South Vietnam and turn them over to South
Vietnamese troops for burning. The idea is to cut
down the growing use of pot by Gls.
The United States has agreed to pay South
Vietnam just under a cent for each marijuana plant
destroyed.
The plan calls on U.S. field commanders to
conduct continuous ground and air searches for
marijuana fields and, once they are located, to turn
them over to the South Vietnamese for burning.
The offensive was launched with a new directive
from Gen. Creighton W. Abrams, commander of U.S.
