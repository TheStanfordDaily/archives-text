# Laird Says U.S. Combat Role In Vietnam To End In Summer
## 
### 
PARIS — Defense Secretary Melvin R.
Laird said yesterday the U.S. combat
role in South Vietnam will end after
the middle of next summer, when the
South Vietnamese will take over the
military burden.
"We will have an air support role
and the combat forces which will be
assigned to the logistics, support and
artillery roles will not be a combat

mission but will be a security mission,
he told a news conference.
"They will be there to protect and
support the forces that are assinged
these roles . . . We will be in a position
where the American combat
responsibility will be removed as far as
South Vietnam is concerned."
Laird praised the Vietnamization
program, under which the South
Vietnamese are trained to take over
combat missions, saying there had been
"substantial progress."
Laird declared the South Vietnamese
forces are "much better equipped,
much better trained, and leadership has
improved to the point where they are
able to take over the military burden."
Laird's statement did not mean that
U.S. soldiers no longer will be engaged
in combat, although their role will be
to protect logistics, air and artillery
bases.
An aid explained: "We will always
have American troops protecting the
remaining forces." Thus, if the enemy
attacks the bases, U.S. troops will be
drawn into battle.
Laird's statement on ending the U.S.
combat role reflected hopes expressed
by the Nixon administration
previously.
Laird gave no indication of when he
thought the last American troops could
all be out of Vietnam.
