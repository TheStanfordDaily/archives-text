# Vienna Campus May Shut Due To Student Apathy
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
fv severe decline in applications for
ntord's Austrian campus has piaced
the existence of the Vienna-based
program in grave jeapardy.
Applications are currently at the
lowest they have been in the history of
the campus. If a minimum of students
(65-70) is not reached for Austria XIV
(Spring-Summer 1972), the campus will
be forced to close.
The picture, however, is not yet
hopeless. The Sub-committee on
Stanford-in-Austria has undertaken a
vigorous program to overcome student
apathy and disinterest toward the
campus.
"Our program is two-fold," says
David Coleman, a student member of
the sub-committee. "First of all," he
says, we want to inform students about
the campus and clear up any
misconceptions they may have. We also
want to change what's going wrong at
the campus."
Question Remains
Yet the question remains," Why are

students not applying to the Austrian
campus?"
"The Overseas Campus program has
lost its glamour," explains Coleman.
"Lots of people have heard had
things about past Austria groups," adds
another former student in Austria.
"The easing of the General Studies
language requirements by the
University has also hurt."
To examine the recruitment problem
more scientifically, the Austrian
subcommittee sent out a questionnaire
as to why students did not apply to
Austria.
Two reasons appeared most often.
The program would interfere with the
curriculum for their major, and there
were financial problems.
"Students usually go overseas in
their sophomore and junior years,"
explains Walter Sokel, professor of
German and chairman of the Austrian
subcommittee. "In many departments,
especially the sciences, programs which
cover more than a year prevent
students from going overseas during
these years," adds Sokel.

The subcommittee now plans a far
more extensive questionnaire to more
clearly pinpoint the elusive question of
what motivates students to apply to or
more often not to apply to the
Viennese campus.
The subcommittee hasalso planned to
have members of former Austria groups
go into the living groups this February
to show slides, talk about their
experiences, and answer questions.
"We have to educate the students
about the great opportunities to be
found in Vienna. There is a great opera,
symphony, great art. You are one hour
away from Hungary and
Czechoslavakia. There is a great future
in the Vienna campus," exclaims Sokel.
The Austrian subcommittee is not
only busy finding out reasons behind
student apathy and acquainting
students with the campus. The
committee is also making many changes
at the campus to attract students.
New Post
The main change has been the
creation of a new post, Associate
Director for Academic and Cultural
Affairs. This person hopefully to be
appointed by March, will serve full time
to help students better take advantage
of the many opportunities the city
offers.
The new director will also be
responsible for bringing speakers to the
campus. "The opportunity is excellent
to hear many speakers from Iron
Curtain countries and also emigres from
those countries now living in Vienna,"
explains Sokel.
Another change is that language
requirements for the campus have been
eased. No longer is three quarters of
German necessary and in cases of
hardship, German 2A, conversation,
may be taken in place of German 2,
which emphasizes more grammar.
Furthermore, courses may now be
taken pass-fail at the campus.
Even moving the location of the
campus has been considered, as there
has been much criticism of the present
location of the campus in the city's
center. Many feel physical facilities are
cramped.
More Austrian Families
In addition more ties between
students and Austrian families are being
developed.
Coleman feels that the location of
the campus in a city which is in the
center of Europe, at the colliding point
of East and West, offers an exciting
experience politically.
Another student adds that the city's
central location is great for travelling,
while still another finds the Austrian
capital's great cultural history is worth
the six months.
Professor Sokel adds, "Vienna is the
easternmost of the Western cities. For
this reason it is far more exotic than
Paris or London."
President Lyman, speaking at the
Daily . staff lunch yesterday, said that
the University would not be able to
help make up the program's losses,
"unless low enrollment were a
temporary phenomenon."

MUST ALL THINGS PASS? A falloff in applications has raised the possibility that Stanford-in-Austria may be closed a little
over a year from now. Among suggestions to perk up the program is one to move the campus from the present location in
central Vienna, pictured above, to a more rural one.

Professor Sokel adds, "Vienna is the
easternmost of the Western cities. For

Paris or London."

MUST ALL THINGS PASS? A falloff in applications has raised the possibility that Stanford-in-Austria may be closed a little
over a year from now. Among suggestions to perk up the program is one to move the campus from the present location in
central Vienna, pictured above, to a more rural one.
fv severe decline in applications for
ntord's Austrian campus has piaced
the existence of the Vienna-based
program in grave jeapardy.
Applications are currently at the
lowest they have been in the history of
the campus. If a minimum of students
(65-70) is not reached for Austria XIV
(Spring-Summer 1972), the campus will
be forced to close.
The picture, however, is not yet
hopeless. The Sub-committee on
Stanford-in-Austria has undertaken a
vigorous program to overcome student
apathy and disinterest toward the
campus.
"Our program is two-fold," says
David Coleman, a student member of
the sub-committee. "First of all," he
says, we want to inform students about
the campus and clear up any
misconceptions they may have. We also
want to change what's going wrong at
the campus."
Question Remains
Yet the question remains," Why are

students not applying to the Austrian
campus?"
"The Overseas Campus program has
lost its glamour," explains Coleman.
"Lots of people have heard had
things about past Austria groups," adds
another former student in Austria.
"The easing of the General Studies
language requirements by the
University has also hurt."
To examine the recruitment problem
more scientifically, the Austrian
subcommittee sent out a questionnaire
as to why students did not apply to
Austria.
Two reasons appeared most often.
The program would interfere with the
curriculum for their major, and there
were financial problems.
"Students usually go overseas in
their sophomore and junior years,"
explains Walter Sokel, professor of
German and chairman of the Austrian
subcommittee. "In many departments,
especially the sciences, programs which
cover more than a year prevent
students from going overseas during
these years," adds Sokel.

The subcommittee now plans a far
more extensive questionnaire to more
clearly pinpoint the elusive question of
what motivates students to apply to or
more often not to apply to the
Viennese campus.
The subcommittee hasalso planned to
have members of former Austria groups
go into the living groups this February
to show slides, talk about their
experiences, and answer questions.
"We have to educate the students
about the great opportunities to be
found in Vienna. There is a great opera,
symphony, great art. You are one hour
away from Hungary and
Czechoslavakia. There is a great future
in the Vienna campus," exclaims Sokel.
The Austrian subcommittee is not
only busy finding out reasons behind
student apathy and acquainting
students with the campus. The
committee is also making many changes
at the campus to attract students.
New Post
The main change has been the
creation of a new post, Associate
Director for Academic and Cultural
Affairs. This person hopefully to be
appointed by March, will serve full time
to help students better take advantage
of the many opportunities the city
offers.
The new director will also be
responsible for bringing speakers to the
campus. "The opportunity is excellent
to hear many speakers from Iron
Curtain countries and also emigres from
those countries now living in Vienna,"
explains Sokel.
Another change is that language
requirements for the campus have been
eased. No longer is three quarters of
German necessary and in cases of
hardship, German 2A, conversation,
may be taken in place of German 2,
which emphasizes more grammar.
Furthermore, courses may now be
taken pass-fail at the campus.
Even moving the location of the
campus has been considered, as there
has been much criticism of the present
location of the campus in the city's
center. Many feel physical facilities are
cramped.
More Austrian Families
In addition more ties between
students and Austrian families are being
developed.
Coleman feels that the location of
the campus in a city which is in the
center of Europe, at the colliding point
of East and West, offers an exciting
experience politically.
Another student adds that the city's
central location is great for travelling,
while still another finds the Austrian
capital's great cultural history is worth
the six months.
Professor Sokel adds, "Vienna is the
easternmost of the Western cities. For
this reason it is far more exotic than
Paris or London."

taken pass-fail at the campus.
Even moving the location of the
campus has been considered, as there
has been much criticism of the present
location of the campus in the city's
center. Many feel physical facilities are
cramped.
More Austrian Families
In addition more ties between
students and Austrian families are being
developed.
Coleman feels that the location of
the campus in a city which is in the
center of Europe, at the colliding point
of East and West, offers an exciting
experience politically.
Another student adds that the city's
central location is great for travelling,
while still another finds the Austrian
capital's great cultural history is worth
the six months.
Professor Sokel adds, "Vienna is the
easternmost of the Western cities. For
this reason it is far more exotic than
Paris or London."
President Lyman, speaking at the
Daily . staff lunch yesterday, said that
the University would not be able to
help make up the program's losses,
"unless low enrollment were a
temporary phenomenon."

MUST ALL THINGS PASS? A falloff in applications has raised the possibility that Stanford-in-Austria may be closed a little
over a year from now. Among suggestions to perk up the program is one to move the campus from the present location in
central Vienna, pictured above, to a more rural one.
