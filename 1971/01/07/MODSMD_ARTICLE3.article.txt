# New Abortion Counseling Center Offers Women Help; Alternatives
## 
### LILA ANDERSON 
A new group set up to guide women
through the legal complexity and
mental strain of abortion has been set
up on campus.
Staffed by volunteers, the Problem
Pregnancy Information Center (PPIC)
started up six months ago in the
campus Lutheran Center to help
women of all ages.
Under the direction of Richard
Orser, a recent psychology graduate
who works full-time without pay, the
clinic referred twenty-five abortion
cases to the Med Center last quarter.
About half were Stanford coeds.
Staff members of the center are
either former abortion patients or are
women who have considered the idea,
rejected it and continued their
pregnancies. Women who come to the
PPIC and are hesitant about abortions
are thus exposed to both alternatives.
Though located in the Lutheran
Center, PPIC has no direct relationship
with the church group. Explained Paul
Nelson, minister of the University
Lutheran Center, which donated the
office space, "We are not saying we're
in favor of abortions as such. But we
are recognizing a need in the Stanford
community, and only factual
information will enable a person to
m?ke a responsible decision."
The clinic is one of many recent
efforts to facilitate the complicated
procedure which women in California
must undergo to obtain a legal
abortion. The process entails an initial
contact with PPIC or a similar agency
that will provide for low cost
pregnancy tests.
In many cases PPIC can refer the girl
to a doctor the same day. Ten days to
three weeks later she enters the
hospital, has a three-minute operation,
and terminates the legal abortion
precedure and her pregnarxy. PPIC will
advise patients about financing.
Even with such availability,

9elf-induced abortions still are a major
health problem. Ignorance can be
attributed to most women who resort
to Lysol, massive doses of birth control
pills and other drugs, coat hangers, etc.
Orser holds lectures and information
groups to warn women of these dangers
and to "give more women, not just
'children of the elite' the advantages of
legal abortions."
A local doctor who performs a
substantial number of abortions for the
PPIC feels "that it's a woman's decision

to have a child and unfair to insist she
undergo a full pregnancy, than be
forced to give up her baby or go
onwelfare." He does not encourage
abortions, but, rather, lets the woman
come to her own personal decision.
He speculates that "the world at
present is run by men, but if men got
pregnant, there wouldn't be any
abortion laws."
He is concerned with the plight of a
girl who has been stranded by her
boyfriend and is unable to mentally
face a nine month pregnancy, nor is
prepared to financially support such a
child. If more legislators fully realized
the predicament of most women who
desire abortions, he feels the
liberalization and possibly even the
elimination of abortion laws would
soon follow.
The California Therapeutic Abortion
Act allows women to have abortions on
three grounds: rape, incest, or throat to
mental or physical health. The third
choice is the most common among
abortion patients and is the basis for
nearly all of PPIC's work.
