# Total Nears $12,500
## Vandalism Damage Cost Mounts 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
"Since late last November at least 18
windows of the Lou Henry Hoover
Tower Building have been broken,"
Alan Belmont, Associate Director of
Administration for the Hoover
Institute, said yesterday. "Each
window's replacement cost Ls around
$400."
Immediately following the window
breakings was a series of false fire
alarms, Belmont noted.
Discussing the incidents, Bruce
Wiggins, University Security Manager,
explained, "the Stanford campus is
experiencing an increase of vandalism
and malicious mischief unprecedented
in the campus' history". Wiggins noted
that the University be forced to pay for
the damages out of general funds.
"The high cost of this increasing
vandalism comes at a time when Univ
ersity funds are urgently needed
elsewhere," he said.
"It's a shame, for it serves no real
purpose. The Hoover Institute is not a
policy organization but a service
organization," Belmont said. He hopes
that the increasing security force
protecting the Institute will decrease

the number of vandalisms this quarter.
Many buildings on campus have
recently been defaced by vandals
painting political slogans. "Only a few
of the buildings on campus have
escaped defacement this past week,"
noted Wiggins. "Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
the Graduate School of Business,
Memorial Auditorium, and the
Undergraduate Library are several of
the buildings marred.
"About $2500 will be needed to
repaint the buildings. This damage and
that of the Hoover Tower Building will
cost the University at least $1 0,000."
When asked who Ls commiting the
vandalism, Wiggins said, "Who can say?
I can't imagine a rational group of
Stanford students doing this."
Wiggins noted that five years ago
there was no need for today's extensive
security provisions. "We're expanding
our security personnel at the present
time."
Rocks and railroad spikes have also
smashed windows in the Durand
Aerospace Building and the Physics
tank. "In the last four years the
number of malicious mischief rases has
tripled. More arson has been reported

in the last three years than in the last
20 years." "The number of burglaries
and thefts has gone up six times in the
last four years," commented Wiggins.
Philip G. Duffy, Business Manager
and Program Coordinator for Tresidder
Union, said that there will be a
$15 0-per-window replacement cost for
all the windows broken in the Union
last quarter. He was forced to remove
all the valuable paintings from the
entrance rooms of the Union and place
them in the more secluded browsing
areas.
"Not only have windows been
broken, but an oil painting was
defaced, costing the University about
$800. In addition three pictures were
stolen costing at least $150 each.

Anyone who would cut a valuable oil
painting with a knife is an immature
idiot," Duffy said.
Duffy also noted that over a short
period of time damage repairs cost the
University thousands of dollars. "The
replacement cost of chairs, cups, and
plates from Tresidder Union is a five
figure number. Vandalism was much
more prevalent last quarter than ever
before. But we're no worse off than
anyone else around here," Duffy
concluded.
In the 1 965-1 966 school year, there
were 37 reported cased of malicious
mischief, 28 4 cases of theft, and 68
reported burglaries. For the 1 969-1 97 0
school year, 8 0 cases of malicious
mischief, 600 cases of theft, and 368
cases of burglary were reported.

ART NOUVEAU OR SOCIALIST REALISM?— Whatever the school, University
officials say that the price of this art is steep.
"Since late last November at least 18
windows of the Lou Henry Hoover
Tower Building have been broken,"
Alan Belmont, Associate Director of
Administration for the Hoover
Institute, said yesterday. "Each
window's replacement cost Ls around
$400."
Immediately following the window
breakings was a series of false fire
alarms, Belmont noted.
Discussing the incidents, Bruce
Wiggins, University Security Manager,
explained, "the Stanford campus is
experiencing an increase of vandalism
and malicious mischief unprecedented
in the campus' history". Wiggins noted
that the University be forced to pay for
the damages out of general funds.
"The high cost of this increasing
vandalism comes at a time when Univ
ersity funds are urgently needed
elsewhere," he said.
"It's a shame, for it serves no real
purpose. The Hoover Institute is not a
policy organization but a service
organization," Belmont said. He hopes
that the increasing security force
protecting the Institute will decrease

the number of vandalisms this quarter.
Many buildings on campus have
recently been defaced by vandals
painting political slogans. "Only a few
of the buildings on campus have
escaped defacement this past week,"
noted Wiggins. "Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
the Graduate School of Business,
Memorial Auditorium, and the
Undergraduate Library are several of
the buildings marred.
"About $2500 will be needed to
repaint the buildings. This damage and
that of the Hoover Tower Building will
cost the University at least $1 0,000."
When asked who Ls commiting the
vandalism, Wiggins said, "Who can say?
I can't imagine a rational group of
Stanford students doing this."
Wiggins noted that five years ago
there was no need for today's extensive
security provisions. "We're expanding
our security personnel at the present
time."
Rocks and railroad spikes have also
smashed windows in the Durand
Aerospace Building and the Physics
tank. "In the last four years the
number of malicious mischief rases has

in the last three years than in the last
20 years." "The number of burglaries
and thefts has gone up six times in the
last four years," commented Wiggins.
Philip G. Duffy, Business Manager
and Program Coordinator for Tresidder
Union, said that there will be a
$15 0-per-window replacement cost for
all the windows broken in the Union
last quarter. He was forced to remove
all the valuable paintings from the
entrance rooms of the Union and place
them in the more secluded browsing
areas.
"Not only have windows been
broken, but an oil painting was
defaced, costing the University about
$800. In addition three pictures were
stolen costing at least $150 each.

Anyone who would cut a valuable oil
painting with a knife is an immature
idiot," Duffy said.
Duffy also noted that over a short
period of time damage repairs cost the
University thousands of dollars. "The
replacement cost of chairs, cups, and
plates from Tresidder Union is a five
figure number. Vandalism was much
more prevalent last quarter than ever
before. But we're no worse off than
anyone else around here," Duffy
concluded.
In the 1 965-1 966 school year, there
were 37 reported cased of malicious
mischief, 28 4 cases of theft, and 68
reported burglaries. For the 1 969-1 97 0
