# Total Nears $12,500
## Vandalism Damage Cost Mounts

"Since late last November at least 18
windows of the Lou Henry Hoover
Tower Building have been broken,"
Alan Belmont, Associate Director of
Administration for the Hoover
Institute, said yesterday. "Each
window's replacement cost Ls around
$400."
Immediately following the window
breakings was a series of false fire
alarms, Belmont noted.
Discussing the incidents, Bruce
Wiggins, University Security Manager,
explained, "the Stanford campus is
experiencing an increase of vandalism
and malicious mischief unprecedented
in the campus' history". Wiggins noted
that the University be forced to pay for
the damages out of general funds.
"The high cost of this increasing
vandalism comes at a time when Univ
ersity funds are urgently needed
elsewhere," he said.
"It's a shame, for it serves no real
purpose. The Hoover Institute is not a
policy organization but a service
organization," Belmont said. He hopes
that the increasing security force
protecting the Institute will decrease

the number of vandalisms this quarter.
Many buildings on campus have
recently been defaced by vandals
painting political slogans. "Only a few
of the buildings on campus have
escaped defacement this past week,"
noted Wiggins. "Stern Hall, Wilbur Hall,
the Graduate School of Business,
Memorial Auditorium, and the
Undergraduate Library are several of
the buildings marred.
"About $2500 will be needed to
repaint the buildings. This damage and
that of the Hoover Tower Building will
cost the University at least $1 0,000."
When asked who Ls commiting the
vandalism, Wiggins said, "Who can say?
I can't imagine a rational group of
Stanford students doing this."
Wiggins noted that five years ago
there was no need for today's extensive
security provisions. "We're expanding
our security personnel at the present
time."
Rocks and railroad spikes have also
smashed windows in the Durand
Aerospace Building and the Physics
tank. "In the last four years the
number of malicious mischief rases has
tripled. More arson has been reported
