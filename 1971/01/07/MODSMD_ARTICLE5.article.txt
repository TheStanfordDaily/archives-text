## No Minority Admission Cuts 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is impossible to make any
sense of the article on minority
admissions which appeared in the
January 6th issue of the Daily.
The caption is not appropriate to
the substance of the article, and
the article itself consists of a
strange assortment of oddly
juxtaposed fact, fiction, and
inference.
In the first place, there has
been no discussion of reducing
that portion of the financial aid
budget necessary to maintain that
level of minority admissions
(including black, Chicano, and
Indian students) achieved in the
present freshman class. The level
achieved in that class is of course
the highest to date simply because
intensive recruiting and

significantly increased enrollment
for all three groups has been
staggered. The program for black
students was launched three years
ago, that for Chicano students
only two years ago, and that for
Indian students only this past
year. The present freshman class is
the first one in which all three
groups are substantially
represented. It was anticipated
that the level achieved in this
year's freshman class
(approximately 175 minority
group freshmen) represented the
commitment the University would
and could afford to carry for
successive freshman classes into
the near future. The Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) has
not affected that anticipation.
While maintaining that level of

freshman minority admissions
next year which was achieved this
past year, the total number of
minority undergraduates will of
course increase, as will be true in
each succeeding year until each of
the three minority groups are
significantly represented in each
of the four undergraduate classes.
The maintenance in the near
future of that level of minority
enrollment attained in the present
freshman class represents the
achievement of a goal which is
presently thought to be
maximally feasible both from an
admissions and a financial aid
viewpoint. In no way does the
decision to maintain such a level
represent a "slowdown," a
"cutback," or an objective which
was limited by budget cutbacks.
To interpret it otherwise is to
assume that the enrollment and
funding of minority students
should be infinitely expanded and
that no other priorities in either
admissions or financial aid exist. I
am not aware of anyone,
including the minority group
members of this academic
community, who have made that
assumption.
Sincerely,
Fred A. Hargadon
