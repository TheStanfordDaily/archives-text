# 'a helping institution'
## Why A Gay Students' Union? 
### fred oakman maud haimson 
What is the problem with being gay? Are homosexual relationships
inherently unsatisfactory, or does the difficulty lie in the way such
relationships are fitted in with other social patterns? As one who has
loved another man, I know the potential for beauty, satisfaction, and
true human sharing which lies before the homosexual. But before him,
as before the heterosexual male, lie any number of personal pitfalls
and occasions of agonising emotional pain. Everyone in coming to
terms with their sexuality must suffer periods of doubt, frustration,
and loneliness; and at times must fail in attempting to establish closer
ties with other persons. Why then does the development of sexual
security and expression for a small minority appear as a special
problem, both for themselves and their society?
Learn to Love
My own experience leads me to answer: that although I probably
learned (using the word broadly, in contradiction to genetic
inheritance) to be homosexual, no one ever taught me how to be
homosexual. This is not to say that I'm still waiting to find out what's
under the cabbage leaf. Rather, I consider sex, though physiologically
merely a way of reproducing the species, as humanly a delicate and
marvellous vehicle of expression between people. Such expression
comes finely, save for rare spontaneous outbursts, only when it is
carefully trained and cultivated. And this learning to express onesell
well, as in so many creative forms, depends upon willing teachers.
The heterosexual male grows up with a surfeit of teachers vying to
explain to him what characteristics, habits actions, gestures — even
what number of horsepower and brand of tobacco will best convey
his feelings to the opposite sex. He is surrounded by books, plays,
films, etc. presenting innumerable possibilities for creating
relationships which may, hopefully, become sexually oriented. His
parents encourage him; schools and churches organize dances and
social functions to provide him with opportunities for
experimentation and testing of what he has been taught. The gay

person's problem is not his homosexuality, per se, but that his society
has not seen fit to provide him with supportive institutions
comparable to those which straight people enjoy. We have instead gay
bars, plays like 'Boys in the Band', and useful words of
encouragement like 'fag', 'queer', and 'queen'.
Replacing Gayness
What some of us in the Gay Students' Union would like to do is
create a more helpful institution. We have no missionary vision of
putting the world to right. No armada of GSLTs will eliminate the
problem; but in the Stanford community ours, and it is really yours
too, may by talk and personal encouragement do some of the teaching
that is needed. The goal is to replace, both for ourselves and others,
and pre-eminence of 'gayness' in considering homosexual relationships
with an appreciation of them as beautiful human relationships.
Certainly they differ from straight relationships, but therein lies a
special value.
I've been bothered for quite awhile by the division between the
straight and gay worlds. Each group tends to remain by itself and feel
safest in that position. Gay people have grown up in a basically
straight environment, whereas most people have not the foggiest idea
what it's like to be gay and they have numerous misconceptions. Lack
of communication and social conventions have set up difficult
barriers. The ability to talk about the problems should widen the
knowledge gay and straight people have of one another. Gay people
feel more comfortable with straight people who have a fairly complex
and realistic idea of what gay people are like. By the same token
straight people might feel more comfortable. So Fred and I have
decided to hold informal discussions each week in a different dorm.
There people will feel free to attend these discussions as a matter of
social and personal interest.
(The first of these discussions will be held in the East Twain
Lounge, at 7:00 tonight.)

ties with other persons. Why then does the development of sexual
security and expression for a small minority appear as a special
problem, both for themselves and their society?
Learn to Love
My own experience leads me to answer: that although I probably
learned (using the word broadly, in contradiction to genetic
inheritance) to be homosexual, no one ever taught me how to be
homosexual. This is not to say that I'm still waiting to find out what's
under the cabbage leaf. Rather, I consider sex, though physiologically
merely a way of reproducing the species, as humanly a delicate and
marvellous vehicle of expression between people. Such expression
comes finely, save for rare spontaneous outbursts, only when it is
carefully trained and cultivated. And this learning to express onesell
well, as in so many creative forms, depends upon willing teachers.
The heterosexual male grows up with a surfeit of teachers vying to
explain to him what characteristics, habits actions, gestures — even
what number of horsepower and brand of tobacco will best convey
his feelings to the opposite sex. He is surrounded by books, plays,
films, etc. presenting innumerable possibilities for creating
relationships which may, hopefully, become sexually oriented. His
parents encourage him; schools and churches organize dances and
social functions to provide him with opportunities for
experimentation and testing of what he has been taught. The gay

person's problem is not his homosexuality, per se, but that his society
has not seen fit to provide him with supportive institutions
comparable to those which straight people enjoy. We have instead gay
bars, plays like 'Boys in the Band', and useful words of
encouragement like 'fag', 'queer', and 'queen'.
Replacing Gayness
What some of us in the Gay Students' Union would like to do is
create a more helpful institution. We have no missionary vision of
putting the world to right. No armada of GSLTs will eliminate the
problem; but in the Stanford community ours, and it is really yours
too, may by talk and personal encouragement do some of the teaching
that is needed. The goal is to replace, both for ourselves and others,
and pre-eminence of 'gayness' in considering homosexual relationships
with an appreciation of them as beautiful human relationships.
Certainly they differ from straight relationships, but therein lies a
special value.
I've been bothered for quite awhile by the division between the
straight and gay worlds. Each group tends to remain by itself and feel
safest in that position. Gay people have grown up in a basically
straight environment, whereas most people have not the foggiest idea
what it's like to be gay and they have numerous misconceptions. Lack
of communication and social conventions have set up difficult
barriers. The ability to talk about the problems should widen the
knowledge gay and straight people have of one another. Gay people
feel more comfortable with straight people who have a fairly complex
and realistic idea of what gay people are like. By the same token
straight people might feel more comfortable. So Fred and I have
decided to hold informal discussions each week in a different dorm.
There people will feel free to attend these discussions as a matter of
social and personal interest.
(The first of these discussions will be held in the East Twain
Lounge, at 7:00 tonight.)
What is the problem with being gay? Are homosexual relationships
inherently unsatisfactory, or does the difficulty lie in the way such
relationships are fitted in with other social patterns? As one who has
loved another man, I know the potential for beauty, satisfaction, and
true human sharing which lies before the homosexual. But before him,
as before the heterosexual male, lie any number of personal pitfalls
and occasions of agonising emotional pain. Everyone in coming to
terms with their sexuality must suffer periods of doubt, frustration,
and loneliness; and at times must fail in attempting to establish closer
ties with other persons. Why then does the development of sexual
security and expression for a small minority appear as a special
