WHEN YOU BUY LETTUCE LOOK
FOR THE BLACK EAGLE OF THE UNITED M
FARMWORKERS UNION. WM
The men and women who pick let- M
tuce in the Salinas Valley are on strike,
Their demands are simple:
A wage raise for pickers, from $1.75 to $2.00 an hour.
Complete ban on dangerous pesticides a.-'d regulated use
of others.
A medical plan for all workers.
Adequate provision of drinking water and toilets.
Establishment of a union hiring hall to end exploitation by
labor contractors.
Ten minute rest periods for every four hous of work.
Two years ago the lettuce workers asked Cesar Chavez and the
United Farmworkers to help them gain union recognition, but
they were asked to wait until the grape strike was over. Then,
just as victory was being achieved by the grape workers, the
lettuce growers sought out the Teamsters and, without con
sulting the lettuce pickers, signed "back door" contracts. The
lettuce workers are now striking for the right to form a union
of their own choice.
Cesar Chavez recently spent two weeks in jail because he re
fused to end the boycott against one of th state's largest grow
ers, Bud Antle, whose holdings are partly owned by the Dow
Chemical Company. Chavez act was symbolic of the Farm
workers' determination, their willingness to endure hardship,
and their commitment to non-violent methods.
Their goals involve more than a wage raise: an end to inhuman
working conditions and a chance to form a union that is close
to them and responsive to their needs and hopes. Their suc
cess will be evidence thai an unwavering commitment to non
violence can work, and consequently a victory for all of us.
There are many ways to help the Farmworkers Union â€”gifts of
money and food are always welcome. By far the easiest way
way to help is to shop at grocery stores that have pledged to
carry only Farmworker lettuce.
Please join us in shopping at:
TOWN & COUNTRY GROCERY, Town & Country Village
Embarcadero Road.
CO-OP GROCERIES, California Ave., Middlefield Rd., San
Antonio Road.
