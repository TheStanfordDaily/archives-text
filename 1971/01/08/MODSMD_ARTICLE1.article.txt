# Students Here Protest Reagan Veto Of Rural Legal Assistance Funds
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
Governor Reagan's recent veto of
federal funds for the California Rural
Legal Assistance Program, (CRLA),has
caused a furor of dissent among
Stanford law students and has cast
political shadows on national
anti-poverty programs.
Reagan has accused CRLA, the
country's largest legal services program,
of "misuse of taxpayers funds" and

failure to serve the "true civil legal
needs of the poor."
Stanford law students maintain that
CRLA has become "too effective for its
own survival." Members of the
Stanford Legal Aid Society, a voluntary
student organization, are circulating
petitions and working part time,
without salaries or credit with CRLA to
demonstrate their unofficial support.
More than 200 people connected

with the Law School have sent letters
to the Governor, protesting the veto of
$1.8 million in federal funds.
Reagan Resentful
Irwin Schwartz, director of the Legal
Aid Society, believes Reagan resents
CRLA's legal victories over certain
California laws. "The very fact that
Reagan chose to veto this particular
program is the best possible testimonial
to its effectiveness."
A New York Times news analysis
stresses the tricky nature of
anti-poverty programs, especially those
such as legal aid. Its questions the
longevity of a program "that essentially
uses government money to attack the
Government. Will politicians ever
willingly plant the seeds of their own
demise?," it asks.
Moreover, according to the Times,
more is at stake than the single
program. Since the Nixon
Administration must decide whether or
not to override the Governor's veto, the
near future could reveal the relative
importance of supporting social
programs as opposed to placating
political supporters.
Gross Violations
Reagan's veto followed an
investigation of California Rural Legal
Assistance by Lewis K. Uhler, director
of the State Office of Economic
Opportunity. The report found CRLA
guilty of "gross and deliberate
violations" of the Federal regulations.
From the opposing sets of
accusations being hurled between the
Governor's office and that of Martin
Glick, director of litigation for CRLA,
it is difficult to validate charges or
denials.
Violations Denied
Glick says that the charges have been
investigated and found false. "Of some
18,999 cases that CRLA has handled,
perhaps four or five had anything to do
with prisons," he states. "None of them
were criminal cases. None of them were
connected with the Soledad Brothers,
Angela Davis, or the Soledad Seven."
The former director of the national
Office of Economic Opportunity,
Donald Rumsfield, had previously
announced that CRLA would be
re-funded, after a favorable evaluation
by a national team. The findings of
Uhler, the state director, were that
CRLA attorneys had used profanity in
public and had represented youths who
were expelled from school for having
long hair.
In addition, Judge Claude J. Miller of
the Yuba Judicial District, declares that
at least five criminal cases came before
him in 1970 where the defendent was
represented by CRLA lawyers.
Private Alternative
The suggested alternative for CRLA
would be "Judicare," a privately
funded, voluntary program of legal
assistance. The poor would be

represented by lawyers who later
collect a fee from the local bar
association.
The future of CRLA rests with the
Nixon Administration, which must
decide whether to antagonize a
powerful supporter such as Governor
Reagan by overriding his veto. Nixon's
own man Rumsfield, found the
program worth continuing, but since
Reagan so vehemently opposes it,
Nixon is forced to chose between the
national social conscience and political
considerations.
In the eyes of CRLA supporters,
Reagan's stand contains an inherent
contradiction. By eliminating CRLA,
he would eliminate a program that
solves problems without driving the
poor to violence.
Cruz Reynoso, director of CRLA,
says, "we are giving poor people the
resources to fight through their
problems in a legal way. It's one whale
of a better way to resolve conflicts than
through confrontations."
