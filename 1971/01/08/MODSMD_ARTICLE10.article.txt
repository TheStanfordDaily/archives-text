### JANE CORRIGAN RICHARD STRAUSS 
Before there were freaks, young
hipsters and kool kats dra ik beer
and read Playboy and listened to
the soulful sounds of The Coasters
as they cruised in their
convertibles. Now, between trips
to the window box organic herb
gardens and local health food
stores, the young and heavy blow
weed, groove on the sounds of
esoteric and politically right on
FM stations, and peruse erotic
publications designed for the
newly liberated.
Inspired by the first New York
freak sex magazines in August of
v i i ), "Organ" magazine was
originally intended to be an
intelligent, humorous and
aesthetically elegant erotic
tabloid. The first issue, published
in San Francisco last July and
banned practically everywhere
else in the United States, featured
an abundance of genitalia, an
interview with Allan Ginsberg,
and a feature article on the Palace
Theater's answer to vaudeville, the
dancing Cockettes.
But vaginas and penises will not
a magazine make, as the staff of
Organ soon found out.
Confronted by difficulties in
distribution, the boredom of
working with limited subject
matter and the realization that
there was, in the words of editor
Gerard van der Leun, "more going

down than sex, rock and roll, and
hysterical politics," the editors
decided to reorganize the Organ.
For those interested in
embarking on a similar media
adventure, some interesting
lessons are to be learned from the
early experience of the "Organ."
Aside from the acute identity
crisis suffered between the first
and second issues, economic
hassles abounded. The original
$1 0,000 raised to finance the
magazine saw it through its
transformation from a primarily
sexual publication to a chronicle
of contemporary culture, but
after three issues and exorbitant
monthly Mah Jongg club dues, the
till was empty.
The problem of national
distribution was the most serious
one faced by "Organ." The first
issue was never sold in New York
or Los Angeles or many other
cities, mainly because of a
particularly graphic cartoon
depicting fellatio between two
men. Van der Leun attributed
distributor's objections to the
basic insecurities of American
male sexuality and resentment of
the magazine's non- "smut"
format.
"It's not smut with women
they're afraid of, because they
have it controlled. They're afraid
of nude men, and they objected
to the magazine being intellignet
funny and insightful. They don't

mind smut as long as it's packaged
that way."
Lack of national distribution
created a corresponding paucity
of advertising, which has been
expected to provide operating
income. The gap has been filled
for the present by advertisements
for San Francisco movie theaters
and Berkeley bookstores, and, in a
burst of frenzied creativity, the
editors fabricated a classified ad
section fo which the following is
an appealing representative:
Fat Couples Wanted
Handsome man in thirties wants
to meet very heavy man or
woman over 350 lbs. Large breasts
and rears inspire me. Digs all sex.
So come on chubbies, write in for
that thrill. Phone and picture, Box
34, E. White Plains New York,
10604.
There were also editorial
problems to be dealt with. Aside
from the difficulties of working
with a low budget and a small
staff, the editors found it hard to
achieve a balance between the
demands of a monthly publication
deadline and their artistic
ambitions. This conflict was
intensified by the changing
priorities of the magazine, which
made necessary continual
rethinking and restructuring.
"We're trying to change so
much at once and the strain shows
up. We want to put out something
that's clean and well-done, but at
the same time, we're putting out a

magazine and not a work of art. It
can be an artistic endeavor, but
it's primarily a communications
device, a space-time event," van
der Leun commented.
In spite of economic and
artistic vicissitudes, it appears at
this point that the "Organ" will
continue to publish its own
particular variety of social
commentary on a monthly basis.
Although finances are still in a
somewhat uncertain condition,
the shift of direction away from
the uninhibited erotic towards less
controversial cultural art has
produced more secure distribution
situation, with the result that the
magazine is becoming more
attractive to both advertisers and
investors. Increased income
should be forthcoming.
Critical response to "Organ"
has been favorable. Short notices
were printed in "Saturday
Review," "Mademoiselle," and
the "New York Times Magazine."
Already plans are being made to
include an "Organ" article on
communes in New Mexico in an
anthology of counterculture, and
editor van der Leun hopes to
expand from magazine publishing
to various film and musical
endeavors. So, despite initial
troubles, it seems that this latest
addition to the Stermer fold genre
of magazine literature will be with
us for these last seasons before the
apocalyse.
