# Altman Zaps Social Targets With Irreverent 'McCloud'
## 
### TODD MeCARTHY 
Aside from being an
outrageously irreverent
entertainment, "Brewster
McCloud" is one of the few
modern films to have treated the
current social scene with real wit
and intelligence. Though the film
resembles a fantasy more than
anything else, it at the same time
manages to evoke contemporary
horrors with more deadly
accuracy than most self-important
projects set in realistic,
recognizable terrain.
The film also suggests that
Robert. Altman possesses the
potential to emerge as the Preston
Sturges of the seventies. Like
Sturges, Altman has developed his
own repertory company, which
consists of such disparate types as
Sally Kellerman, Bud Cort,
Michael Murphey, Rene
Auberjenous and G. Wood. Also
like Sturges, Altman's mise en
scene is rather flat and cold, his

films relying more on rapid-fire
delivery of lines, editing of sound
and movement within the frame
than on meaningful progression of
images.
Though Altman .is hopefully
just at the beginning of his career,
both "M*A*S*H" and
"Brewster" are somewhat too
unromantic and dispassionate to
indicate that I could ever like
their director as much as I like
Sturges. Nonetheless, to deny that
Altman is a major progressive
force in the film industry would
be foolish in an era when
practically everyone with a
camera seems to have found the
means to impose his
tyrotechniques on the public at
large.
One simple testament to the
quality of "Brewster McCloud"
lies in the fact that the film
demands more than one viewing
in order to catch everything
happening in it—even more than
with "M*A*S*H," I felt that one

viewing was in?dequate to cope
with the density of the film. I still
don't really know what to make
of the ending, except perhaps that
since the enemy is too pervasively
everywhere, the individual is
doomed unless he clings,
unceasingly and without
complicity, to his imagination and
to whatever Grace he may be
privileged to possess.
Along the way, however,
Altman takes direct aim on such
targets as upper class culture
matrons, penny-pinching
landlords, MGM, Spiro Agnew and
the pigs, with a surprising
sideswipe at the image of the "San
Francisco super cop." P \ with the
football game in "M*A*S*H,"
Altman allows his showpiece
sequence—here a mock "Bullitt-"
like car chase—to run on too long,
though its denouement is
devastating.
Just as 1 began to wonder how
a project as peculiar as "Brewster
McCloud" could ever have been
accepted at the script level by the
MGM brass, a "Variety" interview
with producer Lou Adler
appeared which substantiated my
belief that "Brewster" is as much
a director's picture as
"M*A*S*H" was a writer's
picture. "Almost none of the
bizarre details that show up on
screen were part of the original
conception" and, in the best
tradition of nouvelle vague film
making, many scenes were written
by Altman the night before
shooting. Altman, who is actually
only a couple of years younger
than the seemingly ancient Orson
Welles, is definitely on his way, as
he is currently adroitly walking
the precarious tightrope between
critical acclaim and commercial
success. "Brewster McCloud" is
now at the Fine Arts in Palo Alto.

Being shown at Tresidder
tonight at 7, 8 and 9 is Fritz
Lang's first Hollywood picture
and one of his best, "Fury."
Though Lang's films were usually
too specifically socially oriented
in order to hold up totally today,
the power of the storytelling
transcends any inherent
limitations in the subject matter.
Spencer Tracy and Sylvia Sidney
are superb.
Also being shown tonight is the
German expressionist masterpiece,
"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." I
do find it too long and cold, but
Robert Wiene's film is justly
famous for its stunning
production design and
camerawork. At Cubberley at 7
and 10.
Another silent landmark,
Eisenstein's "Potemkin," will be
presented in Tresidder on
Saturday at 7, 8 and 9. On
Saturday as well, the Keio
Committee will be showing "1001
Arabian Nights" in Cubberley.
And at the Flicks on Sunday,
Fellini's static bore "Satyricon"
will be imposed upon an audience.
To celebrate the return of Clive
Miller to the campus film scene,
I'd like to suggest that from this
point on. Geology 320 be known
as Mem Clive. Showing in Mem
Clive this Tuesday will be "The
Big House" and "Smart Money,"
with James Cagney and Edward
G. Robinson.
