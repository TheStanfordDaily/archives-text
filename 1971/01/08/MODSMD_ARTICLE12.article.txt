# Drug Use, Effects Discussed At Recent Conference Here
## 
### SCOTT THATCHER 
The present patterns of drug use and the probable
effects of legalizing marijuana were key topics at a
two-day conference sponsored by Stanford and the
U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD), held last month.
The 25 participants at the closed-door session at
Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo Alto often engaged in
heated discussion.
"Drug use seems to be more an extension of
parental influence than a rebellion," asserted Dr.
Erich CJoode, an assistant sociology professor at the
State University of New York in Stony Brook.
In homes where parents are not only liberal
politically but are also abnormal users of tobacco,
alcohol, and drugs, the more likely the children are
to be drug-oriented, he said.
His survey of marijuana use among college
students showed the normal user to be "episodic"
or a "Weekender." Most of those he queried had
used the drug less than ten times. In general it
seemed to him that the higher the quality of the
students and the university, the greater was the use
of drugs.
Dr. Richard Blum of Stanford described in part
whst he found after taking "an intensive sample" of
45 4 Bay Area narcotics and "hard" drug dealers.
"It is important to realize that a since of
righteousness and superior morality, if not even
religious dedication, characterize part of the drug
using and dealing world," he said. But he found,
paradoxically, that fewer than ten percent would
want their children to be drug dealers also.
After seeing the value placed on friendliness ana
honesty for success as a dealer, Dr. Blum asked.
"Given these very American virtues, the lack of
self-identification as a criminal, and the relative
youth of our group, why not expect many to be
maturing cultural conformists going on to legitimate
endeavors?"
He felt law enforcement could hardly eliminate

drug dealing, but he thought it did deter some
dealing among "the unsophisticated lower class
opiate users."
According to Dr. Takemitsu Hemmi, an associate
professor of mental health at the University of
Tokyo, the popularity of heroin and amphetamines
seemed to follow political and economic cycles in
post-war Japan.
At the end of the phase of economic
development, "the distortion of the development
would be made clear and the young people feeling
choked with it would escape into drug abuse," he
said.
Also, "in spite of earlier conclusions to the
contrary, tolerance to cannabis apparently does
develop," he added. But in the case of much more
dangerous drug*, "long term patterns of
hallucinogen use are unlikely to develop."
Dr. Leo Hollister, an investigator at the Palo Alto
V.A. Hospital, is alarmed by these trends. "It
appears that the immediate dangers (of marijuana
use) are almost identical with those from LSD,
probably because at higher doses many of the same
mental and emotional reactions are obtained."
"What is more disturbing," he said, " are reports
of subtle effects on the personality associated with
prolonged use: loss of desire to work, loss of
judgment and intellectual functions."
Professor John Kaplan of the Law School, who
characterizes himself as a "friend" of the BNDD in
their job of fighting "hard" drug abuse, said the
present marijuana laws interfere grossly with drug
education programs by creating a feeling of general
mistrust among young people.
The author of Marijuana The New
Prohibition, Kaplan also said that this was "possibly
the most tedious conference I've been to."
Dr. Hollister pointed out that several conferences
on drug abuse were held last year with many of the
same people. "As an exchange of information you
reach the point of limited returns."

The 25 participants at the closed-door session at
Rickey's Hyatt House in Palo Alto often engaged in
heated discussion.
"Drug use seems to be more an extension of
parental influence than a rebellion," asserted Dr.
Erich CJoode, an assistant sociology professor at the
State University of New York in Stony Brook.
In homes where parents are not only liberal
politically but are also abnormal users of tobacco,
alcohol, and drugs, the more likely the children are
to be drug-oriented, he said.
His survey of marijuana use among college
students showed the normal user to be "episodic"
or a "Weekender." Most of those he queried had
used the drug less than ten times. In general it
seemed to him that the higher the quality of the
students and the university, the greater was the use
of drugs.
Dr. Richard Blum of Stanford described in part
whst he found after taking "an intensive sample" of
45 4 Bay Area narcotics and "hard" drug dealers.
"It is important to realize that a since of
righteousness and superior morality, if not even
religious dedication, characterize part of the drug
using and dealing world," he said. But he found,
paradoxically, that fewer than ten percent would
want their children to be drug dealers also.
After seeing the value placed on friendliness ana
honesty for success as a dealer, Dr. Blum asked.
"Given these very American virtues, the lack of
self-identification as a criminal, and the relative
youth of our group, why not expect many to be
maturing cultural conformists going on to legitimate
endeavors?"
He felt law enforcement could hardly eliminate

drug dealing, but he thought it did deter some
dealing among "the unsophisticated lower class
opiate users."
According to Dr. Takemitsu Hemmi, an associate
professor of mental health at the University of
Tokyo, the popularity of heroin and amphetamines
seemed to follow political and economic cycles in
post-war Japan.
At the end of the phase of economic
development, "the distortion of the development
would be made clear and the young people feeling
choked with it would escape into drug abuse," he
said.
Also, "in spite of earlier conclusions to the
contrary, tolerance to cannabis apparently does
develop," he added. But in the case of much more
dangerous drug*, "long term patterns of
hallucinogen use are unlikely to develop."
Dr. Leo Hollister, an investigator at the Palo Alto
V.A. Hospital, is alarmed by these trends. "It
appears that the immediate dangers (of marijuana
use) are almost identical with those from LSD,
probably because at higher doses many of the same
mental and emotional reactions are obtained."
"What is more disturbing," he said, " are reports
of subtle effects on the personality associated with
prolonged use: loss of desire to work, loss of
judgment and intellectual functions."
Professor John Kaplan of the Law School, who
characterizes himself as a "friend" of the BNDD in
their job of fighting "hard" drug abuse, said the
present marijuana laws interfere grossly with drug
education programs by creating a feeling of general
mistrust among young people.
The author of Marijuana The New
Prohibition, Kaplan also said that this was "possibly
the most tedious conference I've been to."
Dr. Hollister pointed out that several conferences
on drug abuse were held last year with many of the
same people. "As an exchange of information you
reach the point of limited returns."
The present patterns of drug use and the probable
effects of legalizing marijuana were key topics at a
two-day conference sponsored by Stanford and the
U.S. Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
(BNDD), held last month.
