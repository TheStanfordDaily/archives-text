# Santa Clara SC
## Swimmers Open Season Today 
### HALL DAILY 
Coach Jim Gaughran's 1971
Varsity Swimming squad swings
into action today against the
rugged Santa Clara Swim Club at
2:30 in Encina Pool. The junior
varsity will take on the Foothill
Aquatic Club at the same time.
"Santa Clara boasts a good
many top high school swimmers
in the area. And they're coached
by George Haines who has
coached in the Olympics several
times," Gaughran said.
Leading the Tribe's veteran
corps is defending NCAA
breaststroke champion, Brian Job.
Job captured first place finishes
and NCAA records in both the
100 and 200 yard breaststroke
races.
Teaming with Job will be junior
Dave Shilling who garnered third
in the 200 yard breaststroke and
was a finalist in both the 100
breaststroke and the 200
individual medly in the 197 0
Championship meet.
Santa Clara will challenge this
top-flight pair with John Shilling,
Ddve's brother, and John Henken.
John Ferris, 1969 NCAA 200
yard butterfly champ, will carry
the Indians' hopes in both

butterfly and individual medly
events with help from Mark
Shelley in the 200 fly.
1 969 NCAA champ in the 100
backstroke, Fred Heywood,
returns this season and Coach
Gaughran hopes Heywood will
help the Indians wrest the NCAA
crown from defending titleholder,
Indiana.
In freestyle contests, the Tribe
seems to have both excellence and
depth. Leading Stanford in the
sprints is NCAA finalist Steve
Carey. Carey should be challenged
by Rick Eagleston and freshman
Martin Pedley. Pedley held the
top national 100 freestyle time
last year among high school
swimmers.
The Indians' middle and long
distance freestylers will be led by
sophomore Tim Broderick, an
NCAA finalist in the 200 and 500
yard races last year. Backing up
Broderick is senior Brent Berk
who competed in the 1968
Olympics and placed in the 20 0 ,
5 00, and 165 0 free in the 1969
NCAA Championships.
Santa Clara will pit two of the
area's top freestylers against the
Indians today. In the sprints, Joe
Bottom will lead Santa Clara and

Ed McClesky will head the long
distance crew while doubling in
the individual medley.
Stanford's heralded relay teams
should return at full strength with
plenty of depth. In the 4 00
medley relay, all four members of
the NCAA defending champions
are returning (Haywood, Job,
Feris, Carey). The NCAA
defenders in the 8 00 freestyle
relay are also all returning led by
Brent Berk and followed by Bert

Mason, Broderick, and Haywood.
Since 1966, Coach Gaughran's
swimmers have built up a 4 2-5-1
record. Last year, the Tribe
defeated both USC and UCLA in
dual meets but finished third in
the conference meet.
In the NCAA finals, Stanford
grabbed third place behind
Indiana and SC and outpointed
UCLA. Finishing with a 6-1 meet
record, the Indians also boasted
nine 1970 All-Americans.


GASPING FOR VICTORYâ€”I97O All-American freestyler Brent Berk is shown finishing a race last year.
Berk and his teammates open their 1971 season when they return to the water this afternoon at 2 :30 for a
meet with the Santa Clara Swim Club in Encina Pool. Berk was a finalist in the 400 meters freestyle at the
Tokyo Olympics in 19 68 as a sophomore.
