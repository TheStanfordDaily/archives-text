## Zeta Psi Wins Title 
### ROBERT MARKS 
On December 7, long before
the Rose Bowl and fully a week
before finals, Zeta Psi defeated
(Kappa Alpha 20-14,) in the finals
of the Intra-mural League football
playoffs. Both teams had to come
up with upsets to reach the last
round: the Zetes upended the
top-seeded Dislocations, while the
KA's edged past the 2nd-ranked
Theta Delts.
The championship game itself
was hard-hitting but slightly
one-sided, for the offensive
blocking backs and defensive
lineman of the Zetes controlled
the game. Zete quarterback Steve
Kistler usually had enough time to
pass, while KA's Scott Stillinger
frequently had to scramble or
hurry his passes. This difference
accounted in large part for the
margin of victory.
- Tie Ballgame
Zeta Psi scored first on a short
pass from Kistler to end Rob
Towner, and, after a successful
conversion, the score was 7 -0. The
KA's came right back.
Overcoming two dropped passes
en route, Stillinger directed his
team to two straight first downs.
Then, from a little over one yard
out, he hit Stu Boyd in the end
zone, and, after the conversion
was made on a pass to Marty
O'Donahue, the score was tied,
7-7.
However, the Zetes roared right
back, needing only three plays to
regain the lead, the score coming
on a pass from Kistler to Bill
Kisnes. Although the conversion

attempt was unsuccessful, the
Zetes' Doug Allen intercepted a
Stillinger pass on the next series,
and four plays later they scored
again.
The big plays in this drive were
a 50 yard pass to Steve Gaither
and a short pass to Steve
Longbotham for the touchdown.
The conversion was made on a
beautifully executed screen pass.
KA Falls Short
The KA's scored their final
touchdown on a pass to Tim
Batchelder, the catch coming with
only 30 seconds remaining. The
game ended with quarterback

Kistler running about 25 yards to
midfield.
After fall quarter action, the
KA's lead in total Intramural
points with 173. The Theta Delts
are second with 113, followed
closely by Nemesis with 112,
Sigma Chi with 110, and Zeta Psi
with 100.
Basketball competition begins
Monday, January 11, with about
70 teams scheduled to play. Other
winter sports include soccer, table
tennis, weight lifting and
wrestling. The deadline for signing
up for all winter activities is

On December 7, long before
the Rose Bowl and fully a week
before finals, Zeta Psi defeated
(Kappa Alpha 20-14,) in the finals
of the Intra-mural League football
playoffs. Both teams had to come
up with upsets to reach the last
round: the Zetes upended the
top-seeded Dislocations, while the
KA's edged past the 2nd-ranked
Theta Delts.
The championship game itself
was hard-hitting but slightly
one-sided, for the offensive
blocking backs and defensive
lineman of the Zetes controlled
the game. Zete quarterback Steve
Kistler usually had enough time to
pass, while KA's Scott Stillinger
frequently had to scramble or
hurry his passes. This difference
accounted in large part for the
margin of victory.
- Tie Ballgame
Zeta Psi scored first on a short
pass from Kistler to end Rob
Towner, and, after a successful
conversion, the score was 7 -0. The
KA's came right back.
Overcoming two dropped passes
en route, Stillinger directed his
team to two straight first downs.
Then, from a little over one yard
out, he hit Stu Boyd in the end
zone, and, after the conversion
was made on a pass to Marty
O'Donahue, the score was tied,
7-7.
However, the Zetes roared right
back, needing only three plays to
regain the lead, the score coming
on a pass from Kistler to Bill
Kisnes. Although the conversion

attempt was unsuccessful, the
Zetes' Doug Allen intercepted a
Stillinger pass on the next series,
and four plays later they scored
again.
The big plays in this drive were
a 50 yard pass to Steve Gaither
and a short pass to Steve
Longbotham for the touchdown.
The conversion was made on a
beautifully executed screen pass.
KA Falls Short
The KA's scored their final
touchdown on a pass to Tim
Batchelder, the catch coming with
only 30 seconds remaining. The
game ended with quarterback

Kistler running about 25 yards to
midfield.
After fall quarter action, the
KA's lead in total Intramural
points with 173. The Theta Delts
are second with 113, followed
closely by Nemesis with 112,
Sigma Chi with 110, and Zeta Psi
with 100.
Basketball competition begins
Monday, January 11, with about
70 teams scheduled to play. Other
winter sports include soccer, table
tennis, weight lifting and
wrestling. The deadline for signing
