## Polish Riots Hurt Soviet Influence 
### CHRIS PECK 
The bloody workers revolt in Poland a month ago
is part of a continuing history of disruption in
Eastern Europe since the communist take-over in
1 9 45. The most recent Polish protest however, may
well be the most significant development in Eastern
European domestic policy since the crushing defeat of
the Hungarian nationalists in 1 956. It seems possible
now, that the Soviet Union's long dominance of
Eastern European internal affairs is waning.
For the first time since the end of World Warr 11,
an Eastern European government has changed hands
without direct intervention on the part of the Soviets.
The Polish revolt toppled the 15-year-rule of
Wladyslaw Gomulka, as the Soviets sat quietly by and
observed. The precedent set by the Russian
aquiescence is startling if one recalls the action of the
Soviets in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Although the Polish revolt was an economic rather
than a nationalistic revolt, the Soviet calmness is a
major devleopment for the future of Eastern Europe.
Any disturbance in Eastern Europe is a serious
problem for the Soviet Union because they depend so
vitally on the manufactured goods of the Eastern
countries.
The Soviet giant can ill afford the possibility of a
stoppage of the flow of goods from the Eastern
countries into the Soviet Union. The Polish workers
revolt could have led to such a stoppage, but the
Russians sat still during even the bloodiest moments.
Stalin's Power
In Stalin's era, the Soviets could exercise ruthless
and all-powerful control over the affairs of their
Eastern allies, but such a policy crippled economic
productivity and co-operation. In the 1 95 o's for
example, Polish workers refused to operate collective
farms as a result of the strict Stalinesquepolicies, and
now in Czechoslovakia where a tight reign has again
been established, Prague's industrial facilities have
shrunk by one third.
In the hope of gaining productivity, the Soviets
have relaxed their control over the Eastern countries
and have begun to rely more on the power of certain
individual leaders in the countries rather than over
military intimidation.
This new liberalization has presented a problem of

controlling the Eastern countries. "As long as the
oppressive Stalinist regimes were in control in Eastern
Europe," noted Stanford Eastern European History
Professor Wayne Vucinich, the people in these
countries were primarily concerned with physical
survival. Once the thaw began and liberalization of
political and economic systems followed the people
have begun to express their sentiments about
everyday life." In Poland, the feelings expressed
about Polish life were those of anger and disgust.
New Realizations
Another Stanford history Professor, Ivo Lederer,
talked about the future of Eastern Europe under the
new liberalization and concluded, "In the long term, I
think that the instability shown in the recent Polish
rebellion will continue. The Soviets are very bad
managers. They are still squeezing Eastern Europe for
the benefit of the Soviet Union and this is what the
Eastern Europeans are beginning to understand."
The Polish dissatisfaction grew out of the
rocketing prices for consumer goods in Poland. In the
past five years, the Poles' standard of living has slipped
steadily behind those of the other Eastern countries.
The announcement made a week before Christmas
(the annual time when prices are reduced) that prices
would arbitraily be raised another 2 0 per cent
effective immediately was too much for the Polish
workers to handle.
Wayne Garrison, former First Secretary of the I S.
Embassy in Prague, described the revolt in Poland as
"'the people reacting to an arbitrary limitation on
their living standards." Proft ssor Vucinich expanded
on the analysis of the Polish trouble saying, "No Iron
Curtain can completely seal off one political and
economic system from the other (Communism in
Eastern Europe and capitalism in the (West), and the
two invariably affect each other.
Gap Gets Wider
"While the countries of Eastern Europe are indeed
developing economically, the gap between Eastern
Europe and the West is widening. Everybody in the
East knows that things are better in the West. Mary,
especially the young, closely follow styles of life in
the West and envy those who can enjoy them."
As the Polish workers and students boiled into the
streets of the shipbuilding town of Gdansk last
December, the Soviet policy of limited freedom of

direction in the East crumbled as it did in
Czechoslovakia in 1 968. But unlike Czechoslovakia,
the Polish protest was violent as well as highly
emotional. Everywhere, Polish workers clashed with
police to protest the rising prices.
The revolt marked a turning point in
Soviet-Eastern European relations. "If they had their
druthers," quipped one Stanford expert, "they'd have
stopped the revolt right now but that just couldn't
have been done."
It couldn't have been done because the Soviets had
turned away from the terror of Stalin's years, and had
to bank on the ability of the government to survive.
No Choice For Russia
Another reason the Soviets made no move into
Poland was outlined by Professor Lederer. "Although
the appointment of (the new Polish Premier) Gierek
was probably cleared with Moscow," Lederer notes,
"it is equally probable that the Soviets had no choice
but to approve the new man. The riots were getting
very ugly and spreading with the speed of a brush
fire. In Czechoslovakia there were no riots and no
fires. In Poland, the Soviets would not have been able
to take over without a lot of bloodshed. It would
have taken weeks."
The combination of events that led to the revolt in
Poland combined with the unexpected consequence
of a major change in governments give a model to the
rest of Eastern Europe that will not be dismissed
lightly. All the Eastern countries feel the economic
squeeze put on them by the Soviet Union, and all,
with the exception of Czechoslovakia which is again
under a near Stalinesque rule, have a government
similar to Poland's.
Now that Poland has toppled one regime through a
violent revolt, the possibility that the same kind of
revolt may occur in other Eastern countries looms
large.
The Polish worker's revolt is the first
quasi-successful step taken by eastern Europeans to
bring their countries under their own control. The
next few months and years will be critical ones in
Eastern Europe. While Poland has managed to case
out from underneath the monolith of the Soviet
Union temporarily, the full weight of the giant could
easily crush the next Eastern European country that
tries to become more independent.

the Hungarian nationalists in 1 956. It seems possible
now, that the Soviet Union's long dominance of
Eastern European internal affairs is waning.
For the first time since the end of World Warr 11,
an Eastern European government has changed hands
without direct intervention on the part of the Soviets.
The Polish revolt toppled the 15-year-rule of
Wladyslaw Gomulka, as the Soviets sat quietly by and
observed. The precedent set by the Russian
aquiescence is startling if one recalls the action of the
Soviets in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Although the Polish revolt was an economic rather
than a nationalistic revolt, the Soviet calmness is a
major devleopment for the future of Eastern Europe.
Any disturbance in Eastern Europe is a serious
problem for the Soviet Union because they depend so
vitally on the manufactured goods of the Eastern
countries.
The Soviet giant can ill afford the possibility of a
stoppage of the flow of goods from the Eastern
countries into the Soviet Union. The Polish workers
revolt could have led to such a stoppage, but the
Russians sat still during even the bloodiest moments.
Stalin's Power
In Stalin's era, the Soviets could exercise ruthless
and all-powerful control over the affairs of their
Eastern allies, but such a policy crippled economic
productivity and co-operation. In the 1 95 o's for
example, Polish workers refused to operate collective
farms as a result of the strict Stalinesquepolicies, and
now in Czechoslovakia where a tight reign has again
been established, Prague's industrial facilities have
shrunk by one third.
In the hope of gaining productivity, the Soviets
have relaxed their control over the Eastern countries
and have begun to rely more on the power of certain
individual leaders in the countries rather than over
military intimidation.
This new liberalization has presented a problem of

controlling the Eastern countries. "As long as the
oppressive Stalinist regimes were in control in Eastern
Europe," noted Stanford Eastern European History
Professor Wayne Vucinich, the people in these
countries were primarily concerned with physical
survival. Once the thaw began and liberalization of
political and economic systems followed the people
have begun to express their sentiments about
everyday life." In Poland, the feelings expressed
about Polish life were those of anger and disgust.
New Realizations
Another Stanford history Professor, Ivo Lederer,
talked about the future of Eastern Europe under the
new liberalization and concluded, "In the long term, I
think that the instability shown in the recent Polish
rebellion will continue. The Soviets are very bad
managers. They are still squeezing Eastern Europe for
the benefit of the Soviet Union and this is what the
Eastern Europeans are beginning to understand."
The Polish dissatisfaction grew out of the
rocketing prices for consumer goods in Poland. In the
past five years, the Poles' standard of living has slipped
steadily behind those of the other Eastern countries.
The announcement made a week before Christmas
(the annual time when prices are reduced) that prices
would arbitraily be raised another 2 0 per cent
effective immediately was too much for the Polish
workers to handle.
Wayne Garrison, former First Secretary of the I S.
Embassy in Prague, described the revolt in Poland as
"'the people reacting to an arbitrary limitation on
their living standards." Proft ssor Vucinich expanded
on the analysis of the Polish trouble saying, "No Iron
Curtain can completely seal off one political and
economic system from the other (Communism in
Eastern Europe and capitalism in the (West), and the
two invariably affect each other.
Gap Gets Wider
"While the countries of Eastern Europe are indeed
developing economically, the gap between Eastern
Europe and the West is widening. Everybody in the
East knows that things are better in the West. Mary,
especially the young, closely follow styles of life in
the West and envy those who can enjoy them."
As the Polish workers and students boiled into the
streets of the shipbuilding town of Gdansk last
December, the Soviet policy of limited freedom of

direction in the East crumbled as it did in
Czechoslovakia in 1 968. But unlike Czechoslovakia,
the Polish protest was violent as well as highly
emotional. Everywhere, Polish workers clashed with
police to protest the rising prices.
The revolt marked a turning point in
Soviet-Eastern European relations. "If they had their
druthers," quipped one Stanford expert, "they'd have
stopped the revolt right now but that just couldn't
have been done."
It couldn't have been done because the Soviets had
turned away from the terror of Stalin's years, and had
to bank on the ability of the government to survive.
No Choice For Russia
Another reason the Soviets made no move into
Poland was outlined by Professor Lederer. "Although
the appointment of (the new Polish Premier) Gierek
was probably cleared with Moscow," Lederer notes,
"it is equally probable that the Soviets had no choice
but to approve the new man. The riots were getting
very ugly and spreading with the speed of a brush
fire. In Czechoslovakia there were no riots and no
fires. In Poland, the Soviets would not have been able
to take over without a lot of bloodshed. It would
have taken weeks."
The combination of events that led to the revolt in
Poland combined with the unexpected consequence
of a major change in governments give a model to the
rest of Eastern Europe that will not be dismissed
lightly. All the Eastern countries feel the economic
squeeze put on them by the Soviet Union, and all,
with the exception of Czechoslovakia which is again
under a near Stalinesque rule, have a government
similar to Poland's.
Now that Poland has toppled one regime through a
violent revolt, the possibility that the same kind of
revolt may occur in other Eastern countries looms
large.
The Polish worker's revolt is the first
quasi-successful step taken by eastern Europeans to
bring their countries under their own control. The
next few months and years will be critical ones in
Eastern Europe. While Poland has managed to case
out from underneath the monolith of the Soviet
Union temporarily, the full weight of the giant could
easily crush the next Eastern European country that
tries to become more independent.

The Polish revolt toppled the 15-year-rule of
Wladyslaw Gomulka, as the Soviets sat quietly by and
observed. The precedent set by the Russian
aquiescence is startling if one recalls the action of the
Soviets in Czechoslovakia in 1968.
Although the Polish revolt was an economic rather
than a nationalistic revolt, the Soviet calmness is a
major devleopment for the future of Eastern Europe.
Any disturbance in Eastern Europe is a serious
problem for the Soviet Union because they depend so
vitally on the manufactured goods of the Eastern
countries.
The Soviet giant can ill afford the possibility of a
stoppage of the flow of goods from the Eastern
countries into the Soviet Union. The Polish workers
revolt could have led to such a stoppage, but the
Russians sat still during even the bloodiest moments.
Stalin's Power
In Stalin's era, the Soviets could exercise ruthless
and all-powerful control over the affairs of their
Eastern allies, but such a policy crippled economic
productivity and co-operation. In the 1 95 o's for
example, Polish workers refused to operate collective
farms as a result of the strict Stalinesquepolicies, and
now in Czechoslovakia where a tight reign has again
been established, Prague's industrial facilities have
shrunk by one third.
In the hope of gaining productivity, the Soviets
have relaxed their control over the Eastern countries
and have begun to rely more on the power of certain
individual leaders in the countries rather than over
military intimidation.
This new liberalization has presented a problem of

controlling the Eastern countries. "As long as the
oppressive Stalinist regimes were in control in Eastern
Europe," noted Stanford Eastern European History
Professor Wayne Vucinich, the people in these
countries were primarily concerned with physical
survival. Once the thaw began and liberalization of
political and economic systems followed the people
have begun to express their sentiments about
everyday life." In Poland, the feelings expressed
about Polish life were those of anger and disgust.
New Realizations
Another Stanford history Professor, Ivo Lederer,
talked about the future of Eastern Europe under the
new liberalization and concluded, "In the long term, I
think that the instability shown in the recent Polish
rebellion will continue. The Soviets are very bad
managers. They are still squeezing Eastern Europe for
the benefit of the Soviet Union and this is what the
Eastern Europeans are beginning to understand."
The Polish dissatisfaction grew out of the
rocketing prices for consumer goods in Poland. In the
past five years, the Poles' standard of living has slipped
steadily behind those of the other Eastern countries.
The announcement made a week before Christmas
(the annual time when prices are reduced) that prices
would arbitraily be raised another 2 0 per cent
effective immediately was too much for the Polish
workers to handle.
Wayne Garrison, former First Secretary of the I S.
Embassy in Prague, described the revolt in Poland as
"'the people reacting to an arbitrary limitation on
their living standards." Proft ssor Vucinich expanded
on the analysis of the Polish trouble saying, "No Iron
Curtain can completely seal off one political and
economic system from the other (Communism in
Eastern Europe and capitalism in the (West), and the
two invariably affect each other.
Gap Gets Wider
"While the countries of Eastern Europe are indeed
developing economically, the gap between Eastern
Europe and the West is widening. Everybody in the
East knows that things are better in the West. Mary,
especially the young, closely follow styles of life in
the West and envy those who can enjoy them."
As the Polish workers and students boiled into the
streets of the shipbuilding town of Gdansk last
December, the Soviet policy of limited freedom of

direction in the East crumbled as it did in
Czechoslovakia in 1 968. But unlike Czechoslovakia,
the Polish protest was violent as well as highly
emotional. Everywhere, Polish workers clashed with
police to protest the rising prices.
The revolt marked a turning point in
Soviet-Eastern European relations. "If they had their
druthers," quipped one Stanford expert, "they'd have
stopped the revolt right now but that just couldn't
have been done."
It couldn't have been done because the Soviets had
turned away from the terror of Stalin's years, and had
to bank on the ability of the government to survive.
No Choice For Russia
Another reason the Soviets made no move into
Poland was outlined by Professor Lederer. "Although
the appointment of (the new Polish Premier) Gierek
was probably cleared with Moscow," Lederer notes,
"it is equally probable that the Soviets had no choice
but to approve the new man. The riots were getting
very ugly and spreading with the speed of a brush
fire. In Czechoslovakia there were no riots and no
fires. In Poland, the Soviets would not have been able
to take over without a lot of bloodshed. It would
have taken weeks."
The combination of events that led to the revolt in
Poland combined with the unexpected consequence
of a major change in governments give a model to the
rest of Eastern Europe that will not be dismissed
lightly. All the Eastern countries feel the economic
squeeze put on them by the Soviet Union, and all,
with the exception of Czechoslovakia which is again
under a near Stalinesque rule, have a government
similar to Poland's.
Now that Poland has toppled one regime through a
violent revolt, the possibility that the same kind of
revolt may occur in other Eastern countries looms
large.
The Polish worker's revolt is the first
quasi-successful step taken by eastern Europeans to
bring their countries under their own control. The
next few months and years will be critical ones in
Eastern Europe. While Poland has managed to case
out from underneath the monolith of the Soviet
Union temporarily, the full weight of the giant could
easily crush the next Eastern European country that
tries to become more independent.

SHADY AND A LITTLE DAMP—But who could resist running down a wooded
path when you have it all to yourself and the sun is stabbing through the treetops?
It's yours. For awhile.
The bloody workers revolt in Poland a month ago
is part of a continuing history of disruption in
Eastern Europe since the communist take-over in
1 9 45. The most recent Polish protest however, may
well be the most significant development in Eastern
European domestic policy since the crushing defeat of
the Hungarian nationalists in 1 956. It seems possible
now, that the Soviet Union's long dominance of
Eastern European internal affairs is waning.
For the first time since the end of World Warr 11,
an Eastern European government has changed hands
