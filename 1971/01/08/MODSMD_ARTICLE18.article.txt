SACRAMENTO AP — The Reagan administration plans
to hold 1971-72 budgets for the University of California
and state colleges at about their present levels despite an
expected student increase, the Los Angeles Times
reported Thursday.
The Reagan budget won't be revealed until February
but the newspaper said reliable sources report the
governor will propose operating budgets of about $337
million for UC and about $315 million for the state
colleges.
This year the university received $336 million. It
requested $3 74 2 million for the coming year due to an
expected 4.5 per cent jump in enrollment to 106,283,
about 4,500 students more than this year.
Soviets In Syria
WASHINGTON (AP) — At least six Soviet cargo ships
have delivered jet fighters and other military hardware to
Egypt and Syria within the last 10 days, Pentagon
sources say.
The Russian vessels passed through the Dardanelles
from the Black Sea, according to American experts,
carrying about 20 crated aircraft, including MlG2l's,
SU7 and helicopters. Also spotted on deck were cases
believed containing spare parts and other material.
The vessels, observed by U.S. reconnaissance planes,
unloaded cargo at Latakia, a port in northern Syria, and
in Alexandria, a major Egyptian port.
One big Russian vessel, the Molodogvardsk,
apparently tried to mask its true destination, sources

said by notifying Turkish authorities the ship was bound
for Algeria.
But it was observed later dropping anchor in
Alexandria Dec. 31.

SAIGON (AP) — The U.S. Command reported Thursday

WASHINGTON (AP) — At least six Soviet cargo ships
have delivered jet fighters and other military hardware to
Egypt and Syria within the last 10 days, Pentagon
sources say.
The Russian vessels passed through the Dardanelles
from the Black Sea, according to American experts,
carrying about 20 crated aircraft, including MlG2l's,
SU7 and helicopters. Also spotted on deck were cases
believed containing spare parts and other material.
The vessels, observed by U.S. reconnaissance planes,
unloaded cargo at Latakia, a port in northern Syria, and
in Alexandria, a major Egyptian port.
One big Russian vessel, the Molodogvardsk,
apparently tried to mask its true destination, sources

said by notifying Turkish authorities the ship was bound
for Algeria.
But it was observed later dropping anchor in
Alexandria Dec. 31.

to hold 1971-72 budgets for the University of California
and state colleges at about their present levels despite an
expected student increase, the Los Angeles Times

colleges.
