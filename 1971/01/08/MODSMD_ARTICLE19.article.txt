# Senate Approves Graduate Study
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In actions speeding the
establishment of the proposed Study of
Graduate Education at Stanford, the
Faculty Senate yesterday approved the
report of the task force for the study,
and commended its implementation to
"appropriate University officers."
The faculty body also authorized its
Committee on Committees (CoC) to
appoint a steering committee for the
proposed study, and requested the CoC
to formulate a charge to the Steering
Committee, and recommend that
charge to the Senate.
In addition, the Senate
recommended that this charge include,
among those functions suggested in the
report, the examination of the quality
of graduate student life.
In advising that the study be
launched, the task force report cited
"profound dissatisfaction" among some
graduate students with aspects of the
graduate program.
It suggested that the study focus
"on certain well-defined problems and
issues in graduate education, but not
sweep broadly across all areas of
graduate life." It also limited the scope
of the study, rejecting the idea of a study
of the magnitude of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES).
Individual departments will be
studied by five-member committees

appointed by the steering committee.
Their membership will be from
departments other than the one being
studied. However, the report states that
"the people, or at least the areas they
represent, should be suggested by the
departments to be studied."
The six topic committees
recommended in the report will
examine the following broad areas:
—Graduate student teaching, its role
and importance;
—Ph.D. dissertations and alternative

degrees, including variation between
departments, differing definitions of
dissertation, and proposals for new
degree programs;
—Financial support of graduate
students;
—Methods for the change of
graduate curricula;
—Alternative programs, including
the possibility of developing more
Manster's programs;
—The assessment and reporting of
students: performance and prospects.
