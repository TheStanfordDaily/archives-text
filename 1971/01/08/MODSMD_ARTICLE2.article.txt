# SJC Recommendation Approved After Delay
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
After some delay and a request for
more information, President Richard
Lyman Wednesday approved the
recommendations of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) in a trial over an
alleged class disruption last spring.
Controversy surfaced last month in
the case when Lyman asked the SJC for
more information explaining the
recommendations that charges be
dropped against three students and that
one student, Stanley Krute, receive a
suspended suspension. A leaflet
distributed during dead week accused
Lyman of trying to reverse the SJC
decision. Lyman has final responsibility
in all SJC disciplinary actions.
In Wednesday's letter Lyman said he
approved of the dropping of the cases
against the three students because "the
facts did not establish" that a
professor's request to leave his class
"was directed at those not actively
participating in the disruption." Lyman
rejected, however, the idea that
"presence alone at a disruption cannot
constitute an offense of the Disruption
Policy." He said that if the professor
had asked all those not registered for
the class to leave, anyone remaining
would have been in violation of the
Policy on Campus Disruption.
Lyman reluctantly approved the
recommendation for a suspended
suspension against Krute "only because

the evidence as described by the
Council suggests that there was some
ambiguity surrounding his behavior."
He added, "I hope the Council does not
regard the penalty in this case as
establishing a precedent for the
appropriate penalty in all cases of
classroom disruption." Lyman said he
regards such a disruption as one of the
"most grave offenses to the integrity of
the University."
In the conclusion of his letter Lyman
disagreed with one member of the SJC
who feels that the case can have no
value as a precedent or as a warning. "It
stands as a precedent and as notice to
the University community that even in
times of stress such as surrounded the
event in question certain elemental
rules of behavior must be observed,"
Lyman said.
Lyman had asked for more
information because "I find it most
difficult if not impossible to act
conscientiously on the other
recommendations given the spare
nature of the Council's decision." The
SJC sent Lyman more information just
prior to Christmas vacation.
The leaflet attacking Lyman's
actions charged that he was trying to
reverse the SJC's decision and "may be
trying to pressure the SJC into taking a
strong Law and Order stance in all
subsequent political cases; or may be
attempting to establish 'one man rule'
at Stanford."
