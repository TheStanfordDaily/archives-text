# University Support Of Expressway May Hinge On Rebuilding Homes
## 
### ROBERT BRUCE 
University support of the Willow
Expressway plan may be coupled with
the recommendation that the state
highway department finance
construction of housing to replace units
which will be destroyed by the
proposed roadway.
According to Manager of Real Estate
Boyd Smith, "If there is still a
low-moderate income housing shortage
when they begin acquiring the
right-of-way, then my recommendation
will be that the University recommend
that the state build replacement
housing."
President Richard Lyman, when
asked if he would support the
expressway if replacement housing
were not provided replied that, "I'd be
very critical of that aspect of it."
The University in an October
statement to the highway department
expressed support for the Willow
Expressway plan given that those
affected would be relocated to their
own satisfaction.
No Change
Although that letter did not mention
replacement housing, Smith does not
consider the new statement a change of
policy. "I think the state will have to
build replacement housing, and I think
they are committed to it. The promises
have been made, and if they keep their
promises I'll certainly be satisfied."
At public hearings in October and
December several public groups

expressed concern that the expressway,
which would require the destruction of
4 33 units of housing, would overtax
the already tight low and moderate
income housing market.
Although the University is very
concerned with the low-moderate
income problem, according to Smith,
this must be weighed against the
benefits of the expressway.
Popular Plan
He noted that several minority
leaders have voiced support for the
plan. Both the Mayor of East Palo Alto
and the head of the Belle Haven
Advisory Board have supported the

proposal citing the need of minority
workers for a convenient way to get to
work.
The need for the crosstown route
was first seen more than ten years ago
when the highway department began
studying possible freeway routes.
Although a proposed route was
adopted by 1 962, action was delayed
primarily because of objections from
Menlo Park.
The Willow Road Committee was
formed to study alternative solutions to
the problem. The resulting expressway
proposal has now been sent to the
highway department for approval.


WILLOW EXPRESSWAYâ€”University support of the controversial roadway ('E'
Line on above map) will hinge on a stipulation that replacement housing be
constructed for all 433 units to be destroyed.
