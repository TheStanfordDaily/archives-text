# Search Nearly Over
## Provost Imminent 
### 
Stanford's search for a new provost
is nearly over, but President Lyman has
refused to say when he will be named.
Lyman's acknowledged the
imminent selection of the university's
first academic officer, Wednesday,
during an unusual noontime press
conference in the Daily office.
A consulting committee, comprised
of students and faculty members, is
aiding Lyman in his efforts to fill this
critical vacancy. Shortly before
Christman vacation, the committee
submitted a list of seven names to the

President's office. At Lyman's request,
they were not ranked in any order of
preference.
Seven Remain
It is known that the seven candidates
are males, and are members of the
Stanford faculty. Committee chairman,
Dr. Alberta Siegal, cited
"administrative experience and
scholarly leadership'" as the most
important criteria for the selection of a
provost." We were looking for someone
to complement the abilities of
President Lyman," she said.
The committee never directly
approached the individuals it
considered, but talked to people who
knew the candidates instead. The
committee was thus unable to base its
recommendations upon whether or not
a candidate was willing to take the job.
"We were told that it wasn't our job
to determine whether a prospective
provost would be available," said Dr.
Siegal. "We made our recommendations
on the assumption that the individual
named would accept the post."
Conscientious Committee
Dr. Siegal stressed that her

committee worked diligently, sifting
through countless names in a
methodical, conscientious manner,
during the four-hour sessions that were
held each week of Fall quarter. She was
uncertain about the future course of
the selection procedure, emphasizing
that she has "no idea" whether or not
the new provost will be chosen from
the list of seven names.
The current facancy occured when
occurred when former provost Richard
W. Lyman became President. The
provost is the Dean of the Faculty, a
principle policy-maker in the areas of
curriculum and the budget, and is the
first Vice-President in charge during the
absence of the President.
