# Morale, Money Problems Force Full Circle Closure
## 
### 
Plagued by financial problems, low morale, and the
foibles of its streetpeople clientele, the Full Circle has
closed after eight months as a coffeehouse and forlorn
outpost of the counterculture in downtown Palo Alto.
Headquarters for the Midpeninsula Free University
and the Free You newspaper as well, the Full Circle had
teetered on the brink of bankruptcy ever since its doors
opened in late April.
But this fall saw the demise of the coffeehouse. One
youth was shot at in the rear parking lot, and less than a
week later another was beaten up and later died. Staff
support began to fade. In mid-December the group paid
off its bills and vacated the building at the foot of
University Ave.
The situation had not always been so grim. More man
25 0 people had worked to open the place and $20,000
was spent on improvements. The Full Circle weathered a
rough summer of demonstrations and arrests of some of
its radical leaders. Yet for a while the restaurant
flourished as a unique, friendly spot in Palo Alto's
otherwise bleak downtown area.
In spite of its advantages, there were troublesome
undercurrents. No strong leadership was ever formed,
and the staff had difficulty deciding on policies towards
drugs, alcohol that some brought in, and relations with
streetpeople.
In August, Mark .lenson, the business manager was
outsed and a loose collective of MFU, Revolutionary
Union members, and White Panthers took over. The
group was eager to turn the Full Circle around but still
lacked basic business skills.
When the 1 summer quarter ended for students and the
nation-wide economic slump set in, the* coffeehouse felt

a further pinch. The staff was tired, some were in jail,
others lost their jobs, and many drifted away.
Customers Turned Off
Menu selection was cut back, prices were hiked, and
011 occasion too much or too little food was ordered.
Customers were turned off by the streetpeople's
roudiness and panhandling. A steady clientele never
developed.

The MFU said the Free You has moved to Waverly
St. presently retaining their phone numbers. Collective
members feel the community has been let down and
there is a possibility the Full Circle will be reopened if
there are enough people to work.
