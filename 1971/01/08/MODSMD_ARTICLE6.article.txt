ego echo
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 am addressing this letter to
the "tube shaped pattern" who
goes by the name of Barry Wood
and who wrote "The Ego Thing"
of January 5.
It is certainly not very easy for
a man to even contemplate
communication with an inert
biochemical programmed event,
but if you are really out there
Barry -with -no -personality, 1 isten
to me. Some day you are going to
find a woman who loves you,
Barry, if you will even admit the
possibility of love, and maybe
even you will have a small,
freckle-faced four year old
daughter; then, when some "tube
shaped pattern with energy
flowing in and out the bottom"
decides to dissect your woman
with a razor and rape your four
year old daughter, not to mention
the kick in the groin he will give
you as he leaves, reread your
article, "The Ego Thing." You
might learn something.

Vienna debate
Editor, THE DAILY:
Your feature article in
Thursday's Daily, "Vienna
Campus May Shut Due to Student
Apathy" misrepresents the actual
situation. No decision has been
taken or is contemplated at this
time that would warrant your
statement: "If a minimum of

students (65-70) is not reached
for Austria XIV (Spring-Summer
1 9 72 ), the campus will be forced
to close." You do not name your
source for this statement which,
to the knowledge of our
Subcommittee, does not
correspond to fact. The fact is
that substantial innovations are
being initiated now to improve
the Austria program and make it
an even more exciting and
valuable educational and cultural
experience than it had been in the
past. In addition to strengthening
ihe program and publicizing it
more fully, avenues are being
explored to make the program
financially feasible even if the
enrollment should be slightly
reduced. There is no basis in fact
for the impression created by our
statement that the Austria campus
will definitely close if a given
quota of students is not met by
next spring.
If a move from Vienna is
contemplated it will not be to a
"rural setting", as your caption
under the photograph of the
present campus states, but to a
location at the edge of Vienna
which would combine closeness to
the center of the city with the
beautiful landscape of the Vienna
Woods.
Our Subcommittee and, I
believe, your readers would
greatly appreciate your
corrections of the misleading
statements on the Austria
Program.
Walter H. Sokel, Chairman
Subcommittee on Stanford
in Austria
