# letter from Vietnam
## The 						Papal Pen Pal

In recent months Ngo Cong Due has emerged as
one of the most important leaders of the growing
non-Communist opposition to the Thieu-Ky
regime in South Vietnam.
Due is a well-to-do landlord from the Delta
province of Vinh Binh and was elected to the
National Assembly in 1967 on an anti-Viet Cong
platform. This September he attracted world
attention when he released a statement in Paris
which was out-spokenly critical of the South
Vietnamese Government and the American war
effort in Indochina.
Just recently a Vatican source made it possible
for me to see part of an important document, "A
Letter From Vietnamese Christians to His Holiness
Paul VI," which was written by Due, who is a
Catholic. He submitted it to Pope Paul last August
in an attempt to fully inform the Holy See of the
situation in South Vietnam.
The text of Due's letter reads, "The Americans
have brought us (the Vietnamese) a new
'civilization,' that of the dollar . . . with dollars
everything is possible. Dollars can even open up
the gates of heaven in Vietnam . .. According to
American statistics, one Vietnamese woman outof
four is a prostitute .. . the war has become a war
of genocide. It strikes at the roots of an entire
peoples' most basic values."
In carrying out their policy, the letter
continues, Americans lean heavily on "the ruling
class of the regime and part of the Catholic
hierarchy. Clergy and laymen who dare to speak
seriously about peace are slandered.
"The Pope himself is accused of keeping
undesirable company and of listening to bad
advice."
The author of the letter claims that the
Vietnamese Church is afraid of peace because
peace would sweep away the scandalous privileges
it enjoys. "Indeed, despite the war and widespread
poverty, certain religious authorities live like

princes" .. . and "have bound the fate of the
Cuurch of Christ to that of a corrupt
regime ... Young girls are kidnaped in Saigon
during broad daylight.
"Leading newspapers have already
vehemently against the trade in young
girls. .. Everything can be bought. The weekly
Thang Thien edited by Reverend Phan Van Tham,
has revealed that five candidates nominated and
backed by Catholics of the Phu-Binh deaconate
had to pay the local priests one million piastres.
(The letter refers here to a fraud during the recent
municipal elections.)
"One million piastres can buy a draft
exemption. Fifty thousand can buy a tour of duty
in a less dangerous area. It is the poor who die."
The letter asks why the Church has remained
silent and made no statements after the My Lai
Massacre, after the exposure of the tiger cages on
Con Son or in support of the students and disabled
veterans who have "refused to live like animals and
slaves."
The letter goes on. "The Church remains silent
because it well knows that were it to voice
disapproval, the regime would automatically
collapse. The Church of Christ remains the sole
support of this regime. For the effectiveness of the
substantial aid provided by the Americans is
largely contingent on the attitude of the Church in
Vietnam."
The letter then makes a reference to U.S.
Ambassador to the Vatican, Henry Cabot Lodge,
who was formerly U.S. Ambassador to South
Vietnam. "The presence in the Vatican of Mr.
Cabot Lodge as your informant is in reality
disastrous; there are four parties involved in the
war, and the Holy Father listens to only one of
them."
To date, the Pope has made no
acknowledgement of Due's letter.
