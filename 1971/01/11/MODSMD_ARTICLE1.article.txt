# Unemployment Shoots Up Despite Nixon Optimism
## 
### MIKE GRUNDY 
The nation's unemployment rate
shot up to six percent and the highest
level in nine years according to figures
for the month of December released by
the Labor Department.
The increase, reported last Friday,
contradicted the oft-expressed hope of
the Nixon Administration that
unemployment would drop sharply
once the General Motors strike had
ended.
Locally the unemployment in Santa
Clara county reached the highest point
in a decade with a jobless level of 7.4
percent.
The Labor Department announced
that 4.6 million Americans were out of
work and seeking jobs last month.
Retailers hired fewer Christmas workers
than normal, industry laid off more
white collar employees, and some
plants apparently did not rehire all the
workers laid off as a secondary result of
the automobile strike.
Six Percent Level
The last month in which
unemployment stood at six percent was
December, 1961, as the country
emerged from the 1960-61 recession.
Unemployment averaged 6.8 percent at
that time.
Ziegler said that the Administration
still believed that the current business
downturn "will be the least severe
dislocation in this century, as we move
from wartime to peacetime economy."
Improvement Ahead
Asked whether there are any
indications of improvement ahead,
Harold Goldstein, assistant
commissioner of the Bureau of Labor
Statistics, replied, "I am going to stick
with the figures we have and not try to
predict." Many other economists
expect the unemployment rate to rise
further before turning down. The end

of the General Motors strike did not
stop the increasing unemployment,
according to Goldstein, because the
over-all economic conditions in some of
these industries remained weak.
Secretary of Labor James D.
Hodgson said that the Administration
was working to curb what he suggested
were excessive wage increases to
construction workers. "I'm very
dissatisfied with the situation in
construction," he said.
Hodgson, however, later predicted
flatly that the unemployment rate had
reached its peak. He forecast, in
addition, that by the end of the year
the un-employment rate would reach
4.5 percent not far above what is
considered the "full employment"
level. This forecast was far more
optimistic that those generally being
made by other economists, in or out of
the government.
Interest Rate
The government's announcement
came less than 24 hours after the
Federal Reserve announced the third
cut in less than two months in the
interest rate it charges for loans to
commercial banks. The Federal
Reserve's action was described by
analysts as an effort to pump more
money into the sagging economy and
to combat the rising unemployment
rate.
For the state of California
unemployment remained at a high rose
from 5.6 in November to 5.9 in
December. In terms of people, 619,000
were unemployed in California during
December including 85 ,30 0 in the San
Francisco-Oakland area.
A California Labor Federation
splkesman said that 619,000 is the
highest unemployment since the
Depression. However, the
unemployment rate was much higher

than since the work force was
considerably smaller.
The sag in aerospace employment
continued to be the most dominant
unemployment factor in the state.
Record unemployment in Santa
Clara County ended a decade-long job
boom. To ease the situation the State is
allocating $1.7 million in federal funds
to the county. There were 32,4 00
people out of work in November, and
this number increased by 38 00 in
December.
Continued layoffs in aerospace, a
decline in agriculture and construction
jobs, and major losses in food
processing are causing the
unemployment, according to state
labor analysts.
The 1 97 0 job increase average of 2.3
percent was the lowest in a decade in
which defense contracts boasted
growth from 5 to 9.9 percent during
the decade. Construction work, already
hit by a slump, suffered a drop of 17 00
more jobs in December due to
inclement weather. Food processing
jobs, which had been cut back earlier
with the shutdown of several major
packing houses, were reduced by
another 1100 jobs in December.
