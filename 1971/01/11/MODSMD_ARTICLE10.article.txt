## Jury Selection Begins 
### 
Phil lind

The difficult task of choosing a
jury to determine the guilt or
innocence of Ericka Huggins and
Bobby Seale has begun. In early
November the first panel of 100
prospective jurors was brought in
for questioning by the defense
and prosecution. Charged
cumulatively with aiding and
abetting murder, conspiracy to
murder, conspiracy to kidnap and
kidnapping resulting in death,
both defendents are on trial for
their lives, a fact of which
everyone in the courtroom is
constantly aware.
Thus far, nine panels of 5 0
people have been examined and
four jurors chosen from the 45 0

people. The first chosen was a
white middle aged mailman who
has four children and whose wife
is a factory worker. The second
juror accepted was a black man
who is a retired floor man from
Olin-Matheson. He has three sons,
two of whom are unemployed. A
41 year old black women was the
third juror selected. She works as
an Avon representative. The most
recent choice is a young white
woman who is a graduate student
at the University of Hartford.
Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins are accused of conspiring
to murder a fellow member of the
Black Panther Party, Alex
Rackley. The chief prosecution
witness is George Sams, a police
informer and ex-member of the
Black Panther Party.
According to the State, Alex
Rackley was a police informer
that was uncovered by Panther
investigations of him. Sams claims
that Bobby Seale ordered him to
kill Rackley. Then Sams organized
other Party members to commit
the murder.
However, according to the
Panthers this is false. Alex
Rackley was a member in good
standing at the time of his death.
George Sams was expelled from
the Party before the murder
occurred. The New Haven Panther
chapter has stated that George
Sams physically and sexually
assaulted many of the Panther
women and often threatened to
discipline new members while
pointing a loaded gun at their
heads. Sams also has a long
history in mental institutions and
is believed by some psychiatrists
to be a psychotic liar.
Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins are part of what is called
the New Haven 9.Originally there
were 9 defendents, including
George Sams.
The first trial of any of the
defendents was that of Lonnie
McLucas. He was tried on the
same charges as Seale and Huggins
are now being tried on. McLucas

was convicted of conspiracy to
murder. McLucas' story was that
Sams threatened to kill him if he
didn't shoot Rackley, at the scene
of the murder. Since conspiracy
to murder was the only charge the
jury upheld it would appear that
McLucas' testimony was proven
correct.
Three other defendents in the
New Haven 9 have been released
before their cases came to trial
because of the lack of evidence
against them. They are Rose
Smith, Paggy Hudgins, and George
Edwards.
The reason that the trials of.
the New Haven nine are being
held separately is because of the
different roles the defendants are
accused of playing in the murder.
Both Ericka Huggins and Bobby
Seale are accused of being the
people that gave Sams the original
order to kill Rackley. McLucas
and Sams both are the ones that
were at the scene of the shooting
when it took place. The other five
defendants are accused of
knowing the incident would take
place although three of them have
already been released.
The only varified fact of the
entire case is that Alex Rackley
was shot to death by George
Sams. The rest of the case against
the New Haven 9 depends almost
completely upon Sams testimony.
In the McLucas trial almost all
of the Panthers to take the stand
testified, under oath, that Sams
had terrorized the entire group of
New Haven Panthers. No one has
as yet corroborated his story
about his relationship to Bobby
Seale and most have indicated
that Seale would not have ordered
Sams, an expelled Party member,
to execute Rackley even if
Rackley was a police informer.
So far in the trial of Bobby
Seale and Ericka Huggins it has
been shown quite clearly that the
citizens of New Haven
Connecticut have been subjected
to incredible anti-Panther media.
Of 45 0 prospective jurors only 4
have been selected.

The reasons for dismissing a
prospective juror are:
—1) Because of hardship,
—2) Because .they would
believe the word of a policeman
over a layman,
—3) Because they felt arrest or
indictment evidenced guilt,
—4) Because they had a firm
opinion of the case already,
—5) Because of prejudice
against the defendants or the
Black Panther Party,
—6) Because they did not
believe in capital punishment,
—7) Because they felt that
Seale and Huggins could not get a
fair trial.
If the judge refuses to dismiss a
juror if either the defense or the
prosecution motions for that,
each side has 60 peremptory
challenges in which they can
dismiss a juror for any reason.
Thus far in the jury selection the
defense has used 28 peremptory
challenges while the prosecution
has used only 15 .
If the defense uses all. of its
challenges before the completion
of jury selection then it will be
unable to challenge a juror whom
the defense suspects to be
prejudiced.
It is estimated by the court
that the jury selection will
continue for another two months.
In the last few months the New
Haven press has been very critical
of the Black Panther Party and
especially the New Haven 9. This
makes finidng 12 people that have
not been swayed against the
defendants an extremely difficult
job. Kingman Brewster, president
of Yale University has stated that
he sees no way that the Panthers
can ever get a fair trial in this
country.
With such little evidence that
can be varified by anyone accept
George Sams it seems ridiculous
that Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins should even be going to
trial.

to murder a fellow member of the
Black Panther Party, Alex
Rackley. The chief prosecution
witness is George Sams, a police
informer and ex-member of the
Black Panther Party.
According to the State, Alex
Rackley was a police informer
that was uncovered by Panther
investigations of him. Sams claims
that Bobby Seale ordered him to
kill Rackley. Then Sams organized
other Party members to commit
the murder.
However, according to the
Panthers this is false. Alex
Rackley was a member in good
standing at the time of his death.
George Sams was expelled from
the Party before the murder
occurred. The New Haven Panther
chapter has stated that George
Sams physically and sexually
assaulted many of the Panther
women and often threatened to
discipline new members while
pointing a loaded gun at their
heads. Sams also has a long
history in mental institutions and
is believed by some psychiatrists
to be a psychotic liar.
Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins are part of what is called
the New Haven 9.Originally there
were 9 defendents, including
George Sams.
The first trial of any of the
defendents was that of Lonnie
McLucas. He was tried on the
same charges as Seale and Huggins
are now being tried on. McLucas

was convicted of conspiracy to
murder. McLucas' story was that
Sams threatened to kill him if he
didn't shoot Rackley, at the scene
of the murder. Since conspiracy
to murder was the only charge the
jury upheld it would appear that
McLucas' testimony was proven
correct.
Three other defendents in the
New Haven 9 have been released
before their cases came to trial
because of the lack of evidence
against them. They are Rose
Smith, Paggy Hudgins, and George
Edwards.
The reason that the trials of.
the New Haven nine are being
held separately is because of the
different roles the defendants are
accused of playing in the murder.
Both Ericka Huggins and Bobby
Seale are accused of being the
people that gave Sams the original
order to kill Rackley. McLucas
and Sams both are the ones that
were at the scene of the shooting
when it took place. The other five
defendants are accused of
knowing the incident would take
place although three of them have
already been released.
The only varified fact of the
entire case is that Alex Rackley
was shot to death by George
Sams. The rest of the case against
the New Haven 9 depends almost
completely upon Sams testimony.
In the McLucas trial almost all
of the Panthers to take the stand
testified, under oath, that Sams
had terrorized the entire group of
New Haven Panthers. No one has
as yet corroborated his story
about his relationship to Bobby
Seale and most have indicated
that Seale would not have ordered
Sams, an expelled Party member,
to execute Rackley even if
Rackley was a police informer.
So far in the trial of Bobby
Seale and Ericka Huggins it has
been shown quite clearly that the
citizens of New Haven
Connecticut have been subjected
to incredible anti-Panther media.
Of 45 0 prospective jurors only 4
have been selected.

The reasons for dismissing a
prospective juror are:
—1) Because of hardship,
—2) Because .they would
believe the word of a policeman
over a layman,
—3) Because they felt arrest or
indictment evidenced guilt,
—4) Because they had a firm
opinion of the case already,
—5) Because of prejudice
against the defendants or the
Black Panther Party,
—6) Because they did not
believe in capital punishment,
—7) Because they felt that
Seale and Huggins could not get a
fair trial.
If the judge refuses to dismiss a
juror if either the defense or the
prosecution motions for that,
each side has 60 peremptory
challenges in which they can
dismiss a juror for any reason.
Thus far in the jury selection the
defense has used 28 peremptory
challenges while the prosecution
has used only 15 .
If the defense uses all. of its
challenges before the completion
of jury selection then it will be
unable to challenge a juror whom
the defense suspects to be
prejudiced.
It is estimated by the court
that the jury selection will
continue for another two months.
In the last few months the New
Haven press has been very critical
of the Black Panther Party and
especially the New Haven 9. This
makes finidng 12 people that have
not been swayed against the
defendants an extremely difficult
job. Kingman Brewster, president
of Yale University has stated that
he sees no way that the Panthers
can ever get a fair trial in this
country.
With such little evidence that
can be varified by anyone accept
George Sams it seems ridiculous
that Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins should even be going to
trial.

The difficult task of choosing a
jury to determine the guilt or
innocence of Ericka Huggins and
Bobby Seale has begun. In early
November the first panel of 100
prospective jurors was brought in
for questioning by the defense
and prosecution. Charged
cumulatively with aiding and
abetting murder, conspiracy to
murder, conspiracy to kidnap and
kidnapping resulting in death,
both defendents are on trial for
their lives, a fact of which
everyone in the courtroom is
constantly aware.
Thus far, nine panels of 5 0
people have been examined and
four jurors chosen from the 45 0

people. The first chosen was a
white middle aged mailman who
has four children and whose wife
is a factory worker. The second
juror accepted was a black man
who is a retired floor man from
Olin-Matheson. He has three sons,
two of whom are unemployed. A
41 year old black women was the
third juror selected. She works as
an Avon representative. The most

woman who is a graduate student
at the University of Hartford.

same charges as Seale and Huggins
are now being tried on. McLucas

was convicted of conspiracy to
murder. McLucas' story was that
Sams threatened to kill him if he
didn't shoot Rackley, at the scene
of the murder. Since conspiracy
to murder was the only charge the
jury upheld it would appear that
McLucas' testimony was proven
correct.
Three other defendents in the
New Haven 9 have been released
before their cases came to trial
because of the lack of evidence
against them. They are Rose
Smith, Paggy Hudgins, and George
Edwards.
The reason that the trials of.
the New Haven nine are being
held separately is because of the
different roles the defendants are
accused of playing in the murder.
Both Ericka Huggins and Bobby
Seale are accused of being the
people that gave Sams the original
order to kill Rackley. McLucas
and Sams both are the ones that
were at the scene of the shooting
when it took place. The other five
defendants are accused of
knowing the incident would take
place although three of them have
already been released.
The only varified fact of the
entire case is that Alex Rackley
was shot to death by George
Sams. The rest of the case against
the New Haven 9 depends almost
completely upon Sams testimony.
In the McLucas trial almost all
of the Panthers to take the stand
testified, under oath, that Sams
had terrorized the entire group of
New Haven Panthers. No one has
as yet corroborated his story
about his relationship to Bobby
Seale and most have indicated
that Seale would not have ordered
Sams, an expelled Party member,
to execute Rackley even if
Rackley was a police informer.
So far in the trial of Bobby
Seale and Ericka Huggins it has
been shown quite clearly that the
citizens of New Haven
Connecticut have been subjected
to incredible anti-Panther media.
Of 45 0 prospective jurors only 4
have been selected.

The reasons for dismissing a
prospective juror are:
—1) Because of hardship,
—2) Because .they would
believe the word of a policeman
over a layman,
—3) Because they felt arrest or
indictment evidenced guilt,
—4) Because they had a firm
opinion of the case already,
—5) Because of prejudice
against the defendants or the
Black Panther Party,
—6) Because they did not
believe in capital punishment,
—7) Because they felt that
Seale and Huggins could not get a
fair trial.
If the judge refuses to dismiss a
juror if either the defense or the
prosecution motions for that,
each side has 60 peremptory
challenges in which they can
dismiss a juror for any reason.
Thus far in the jury selection the
defense has used 28 peremptory
challenges while the prosecution
has used only 15 .
If the defense uses all. of its
challenges before the completion
of jury selection then it will be
unable to challenge a juror whom
the defense suspects to be
prejudiced.
It is estimated by the court
that the jury selection will
continue for another two months.
In the last few months the New
Haven press has been very critical
of the Black Panther Party and
especially the New Haven 9. This
makes finidng 12 people that have
not been swayed against the
defendants an extremely difficult
job. Kingman Brewster, president
of Yale University has stated that
he sees no way that the Panthers
can ever get a fair trial in this
country.
With such little evidence that
can be varified by anyone accept
George Sams it seems ridiculous
that Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins should even be going to
trial.

The difficult task of choosing a
jury to determine the guilt or
innocence of Ericka Huggins and
Bobby Seale has begun. In early
November the first panel of 100
prospective jurors was brought in
for questioning by the defense
and prosecution. Charged
cumulatively with aiding and
abetting murder, conspiracy to
murder, conspiracy to kidnap and
kidnapping resulting in death,
both defendents are on trial for
their lives, a fact of which
everyone in the courtroom is
constantly aware.
Thus far, nine panels of 5 0
people have been examined and
four jurors chosen from the 45 0

people. The first chosen was a
white middle aged mailman who
has four children and whose wife
is a factory worker. The second
juror accepted was a black man
who is a retired floor man from
Olin-Matheson. He has three sons,
two of whom are unemployed. A
41 year old black women was the
third juror selected. She works as
an Avon representative. The most
recent choice is a young white
woman who is a graduate student
at the University of Hartford.
Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins are accused of conspiring
to murder a fellow member of the
Black Panther Party, Alex
Rackley. The chief prosecution
witness is George Sams, a police
informer and ex-member of the
Black Panther Party.
According to the State, Alex
Rackley was a police informer
that was uncovered by Panther
investigations of him. Sams claims
that Bobby Seale ordered him to
kill Rackley. Then Sams organized
other Party members to commit
the murder.
However, according to the
Panthers this is false. Alex
Rackley was a member in good
standing at the time of his death.
George Sams was expelled from
the Party before the murder
occurred. The New Haven Panther
chapter has stated that George
Sams physically and sexually
assaulted many of the Panther
women and often threatened to
discipline new members while
pointing a loaded gun at their
heads. Sams also has a long
history in mental institutions and
is believed by some psychiatrists
to be a psychotic liar.
Bobby Seale and Ericka
Huggins are part of what is called
the New Haven 9.Originally there
were 9 defendents, including
George Sams.
