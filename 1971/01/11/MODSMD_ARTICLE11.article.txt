econ sexism
Editor,THE DAILY:
The article Monday on the
male/female ratio (although I'd
disagree with some of the
justifications for the status quo)
did point out the interactions
between this and other sex
discrimination problems. Dr.
Cross's comments on the lack of
female faculty as models
particularly struck me.
She mentions the lack of
women majoring in science at
Stanford compared to colleges

where there are more women on
the faculty. The sciences, though,
don't have nearly the warped ratio
here that economics does. At
Stanford this year there are 220
male undergraduate econ. majors
and only 30 women! (Last year it
was 217 to 17.) The quite large
economics faculty at Stanford
includes No women. This
certainly does not reflect a lack of
really good female economists, for
there are a number. Nor is there a
lack of women students
potentially interested in
economics. At Wellesley (where I
became an econ. major),
economics was considered one of
the best majors and was a very
popular one. Not only that, but
graduates did find economics jobs.
Employers actively sought
Wellesley econ. majors. As far as I
can see, they seek few from
Stanford. Although this partly
refects the fact that Wellesley
grads, as women, could be paid
less, it was primarily due to the
high quality of the economics
training.

My overall feeling is that there
is an enormous potential at
Stanford for improving education
(especially at the undergraduate
level, where it really needs it) by
hiring considerably more women
faculty members.

misquote
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am sorry to have to point out
a misquote in Doyle McManus'
otherwise excellent article on
innovations in undergraduate
education at Stanford which
appeared in last Thursday's Daily.
In commenting on enrollment
shifts in the past few years, I did
note that there has been a drop in
undergraduate enrollment in
engineering and a simultaneous
sharp increase in enrollment
pressures in art, music, and
film-making. These particular
examples were mentioned in the
interview. I summarized by stating
that in recent years there has been
some shift in student interest
from technologically-oriented
fields to the expressive fields
sometimes called the creative arts.
I did not say, nor did I imply,
that engineering is not a creative
field. Engineering is by its very
nature creative, and the Stanford
School of Engineering has been
particularly outstanding in
devising courses and programs
which make manifest the creative
nature of engineering.
