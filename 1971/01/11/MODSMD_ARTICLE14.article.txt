## Swimmers Win Opener 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's varsity swimmers
cruised to an easy 77-27 victory
in last Friday's season-opener
against the Santa Clara Swim
Club. The Indians captured first
place finishes in nine of eleven
individual events and won both
relays.
In the one-sided debacle,
former Olympian Brent Berk
easily bested competitors in both
the 1000 and 5 00 yard freestyle
races. Berk breezed to victory in
each race winning the 1000 in
10:08 J and thesoo in 4:50.7.
Coach Jim Gaughran said,
"The times were pretty good.
Berk's times were actually real
good considering he slacked off in
the 1000 to swim a good 5 0 0. He
should have a really good year."
Supporting Berk in the long
distance events were Tim
Broderick who finished third in

the 500 and Mark Shelley, third in
the 1000.
Nichols Wins Diving
Ted Nichols was another
double winner in the one and
three meter diving competition.
Nichols was the Pac-8 champion
in the three meter diving last year.
In the sprints, the Indians
swam 1-2 in the 200 free with
Tim Broderick and Bert Mason. In
the 5 0 free, frosh Martin Pedley
and Rick Eagleston finished 2-3.
In the 100 free, Pedley was first
while Ray Collins ended up third.
John Ferris dominated the 200
yard butterfly and teamed with
Fred Haywood, Brian Job, and
Pedley to win the medley relay.
Rick Longinotti was third in the
200 fly.
Haywood outswam opponents
by nearly three seconds in gaining
a first place in the 200 yard
backstroke contest. In the 200

breaststroke, record-holder Brian
Job and Dave Shilling came in 1 -2.
Dave Shilling and Brian Job
captured second and third in the
200 yard individual medley race.
In the 200 yard freestyle relay,
the Indians sped to victory behind
Eagleston, Mason, Collins, and
Haywood.
JV's Fall
In the junior varsity
competition, Foothill Aquatic
Club and Ladera Swim Club
combined to topple Stanford
65-44.
Coach Gaughran was impressed
with Stanford Brave Terry Sutton
who swam a winning race in the
100 freestyle with a time one
second faster than Brent Berk'
varsity-winning time.
This upcoming weekend, the
Indians travel to Oregon to
challenge both Oregon State and
Oregon.

breaststroke and swam on the
