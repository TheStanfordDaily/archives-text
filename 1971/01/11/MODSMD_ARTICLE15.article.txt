# Basketballers Dumped Twice
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
It was a bad weekend for
Stanford's basketball team, but
the outlook for this coming
weekend appears to be even
worse. The Indians opened their
Pac-8 season on the road this
weekend with losses to Oregon,
8 2-72 and Oregon State, 88-70.
And this Friday night, they come
home to face first-ranked and
undefeated UCLA, followed by

third-ranked and also unbeaten
USC on Saturday night.
Friday night, the Indians
jumped off to a 15-5 lead against
the 14th-ranked Oregon Ducks.
But after trailing by two at
halftime, the Ducks, led by center
Stan Love and reserve guard Rick
Brousterhous, came out strong
and quickly went ahead.
Stanford closed to within two
at 69-67, but Oregon outscored
them 13-5 in the final eight
minutes. Love paced all scorers
with 30 points and Brousterhous,
who had previously scored only
nine points all year, added 14.
Claude Terry paced Stanford with
23, followed by Mike Michel's 17.
Saturday night in Corvallis, the
Indians stayed close for awhile,
before OSU pulled away for an
easy win. A hot-shooting effort
led by guard Mike Keck gave the
Beavers a 47 -39 halftime lead.
And in the second half, the Cards
could never get closer than nine
and OSU coasted in.
Freddie Boyd led the Beavers
with 21 points, while Keck and
center Gary Arbelbide both added
16. Terry was high point man for
the game with 24, while Michel
added 15.

shot in a game earlier this year at Maples Pavilion. Michel scored 32
points in two games this weekend but the Cards still lost twice. The
Indians return home to face UCLA and USC this weekend.
