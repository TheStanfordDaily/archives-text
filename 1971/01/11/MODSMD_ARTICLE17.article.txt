HOUSTON (AP) — At an executive meeting yesterday in Houston,
the National Collegiate Athletic Association took away the
University of California's 1970 NCAA outdoor track championship
because they used an ineligible athlete. The athlete in question,
Isaac Curtis finished second in the 100-yard dash, fourth in the
22 0, and ran on the winning 440 yard relay team.
The NCAA took away the 22 points Curtis accounted for,
dropping Cal's total from 4 0-18 and they awarded the team title to
Brigham Young, Kansas, and Oregon, who all tied with 35 points.
The decision takes on added importance, not only because
Curtis may lose a season of eligibility in both track and football,
but also because since he did play football this fall, Cal may be
forced to forfeit all their football victories. Any decision on this
will have to come from the Pacific-8 .
Under NCAA policy, a student must predict at least a 1.6
average on a 4 .0 scale to be eligible for athletic participation, and
according to the NCAA Executive Council, California had
inadvertently failed to submit a prediction for Curtis.
