# Tito To To Step Down
## Yugoslavia To Face Political Crisis 
### CHRIS PECK 
Josip Tito, 18, will soon step down
as the leader of Yugoslavia. During his
quarter century as the sole political
head of Communist Yugoslavia, Tito
has tenaciously guided the Balkan
country through a maze of foreign and
domestic challenges to Yugoslavia.
Today, the country faces another
crucial threat to existence since Tito's
long rule began. The problem of finding
a successor to the Marshal may prove
fatal to Yugoslavian independence and
freedom.
The threat to Yugoslavian stability
after Tito comes from two sides. On
one hand, the Soviet Unionhopes to

regain some influence after 25 years of
Tito's brand of "National
Communism." In 1948, the Soviets
expelled Yugoslavia from the
international communist organization,
the Cominform, only to see the
country prosper under a more relaxed
and liberal regime. In 195 6 and again in
1 968 , the Soviets were angered by
Yugoslav protests over the Soviet
interventions in Hungary and
Czechoslovakia. The Soviets hope to
gain a stronger foothold in Yugoslavia
after Tito.
A second danger to the post-Tito
Yugoslavia is the rekindled ethnic
problems inside the country. Since
1914 when the separate regions of
Serbia and Croatia were formed into a
unified state, there has been constant
friction between these two historical
enemies. In 1928 , a separatist parliment
was set up inside Yugoslavia, in 1 934 a
Civil War broke out between the two
factions and today the situation is not
much better. Croation separatists hope
to carve up Yugoslavia after Tito
separating the Republics of Serbia and
Croatia, some observers feel.

These same sources feel that the
Soviet Union will try to capitalize on
the internal differences in Yugoslavia as
a means of gaining more control over
their maverick ally. "The Russians are
very interested in playing separatist
games in Yugoslavia," observed Milorad
Popov, an Eastern European advisor at
the Hoover Institute. "Since World War
II," "Popov noted, "the Croation
separatists have been simmering under
Tito's regime and I'm afraid after Tito's
gone, the nationalist anger will develop
again and the Soviets will gain a much
stronger foothold."
Already the Soviets seem to be
fanning the flames of separatist fever.
"Yugoslavian differences are being used
by the Soviets," explained history
professor Wayne Vucinich, "to widen
the present internal differences.
They've used psychological warfare and
disseminated propaganda or the
expressed purpose of widening the
nationality conflicts."
A group of fascist Croations
operating from Germany is also being
supported by the Soviet Union. This
group, called Ustashi, advocates the
division of Yugoslavia into two or more
sections with the Soviet Union
controlling them. "By supporting the
revival of the Yugoslav Stalinists
operating from foreign bases," said
Professor Vucinich," the Soviets hope
to gain a lever for the express purpose
of undermining the present structure of
the Yugoslav system, concerning the
choosing of Tito's successor."
Collective Presidency
Tito realizes the crucial need to find
a suitable successor in Yugoslavia who
can quell the internal differences and at
the same time remain unified against
Soviet meddling. In Zagreb last fall, the
Marshal outlined a proposal for a
collective presidency whereby all six
republics in Yugoslavia would have
representation.
Such an arrangement, Tito hopes,
would satisfy the internal activists since

all factions would have a part of the
presidency. At the same time, the
consolidation of power at the top of
the government would allow Yugoslavia
a strong central base for repelling
possible Soviet influence that could
creep in at the state and local levels.
Tito's plan however, is a weak
substitute for strong, unified
leadership. Ivo Lederer, a history
professor specializing in Soviet foreign
policy, predicted that "the Soviets will
make a try to change the policy
direction of the Yugoslav government
after Tito. The internal differences in
the country are profound. The
differences make good cannon fodder
for outside intervention in the
government. I'd say the prospects for
Yugoslavia after Tito aren't very
agreeable."
Two Factors
Grim as Yugoslavia's future looks,
there are two factors that could help
the country through the next few
months and years. First, the experience
with free travel between the West and
Yugoslavia, relaxed trade agreements
with the West, and an active cultural
exchange with the rest of Europe has
whetted the appetites of the Yugoslavs

for continued liberalization. A change
in foreign policy towards the West
would meet with widespread criticism
in Yugoslavia.
"The regime has broadened the
people's alternatives," Professor
Vucinich notes, "Everybody in
Yugoslavia wants to have an Opel or
Mercedes from Germany. Unlike the
Czechs, the Yugoslavs are militant
about the defense of their increasing
affluence and would tend to unite
against a challenge to their way of life."
A second factor working in favor of
Yugoslavian unity is the Army. If a
seperatist war broke out after Tito's
death, most observers believe that the
Yugoslav army would intervene as a
force for continued unity.
The succession problem in
Yugoslavia will be difficult in Eastern
Europe that can only be solved if Tito's
role as a benevolent dictator can
peaceable pass into the hand of a
successor or successors. Yugoslavia will
continue as a model of Communist
prosperity and advancement
throughout the world if the ability of
the Old Marshall to make one last stand
against the challenges to Yugoslav unity
and independence.
