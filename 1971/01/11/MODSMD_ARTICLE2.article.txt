# Unsuspecting Student Awarded A Rhodes
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"I study one week before mid-terms
and two weeks before finals and
collapse from exhaustion in between,"
explains John M. Page, Jr., Rhodes
Scholar.
The 21-year-old economics major
will study economics and modern
history at England's prestigious Oxford
University for two years. He was
"amazed" when he made it to the state
competition, "astounded" when he
reached the regional interviews, and
"flabbergasted" when he became one
of the 32 American winners of the
coveted scholarship.
"I always thought you had to be a
jock or a student body president," the
senior from Saratoga comments,
referring to Cecil Rhodes' insistence on
"mental and physical vigor."
Although he plays intramural
football in fall and water polo in spring,
Page is hardly a jock and his
extra-curricular activities consist of "a
lot of little things." In his spare time he
reads and takes flying lessons, which he
is dropping for lack of time. Page is also
business manager of the newly-formed
"Stanford Quarterly Review," a
publication for undergraduate
expository writing.
Average Looking Person
The "scholar" is an average-looking
person: average height, average brown
hair of average length, average dress. He
lives in a trailer that looks exactly like
every other trailer in Manzanita Park.
Page talks as though he were not
very impressed with himself. "If there
had been a $10 application fee for the
Rhodes, I would never have applied,"
he says.
Page says that he doesn't feel very
scholarly, but when he starts talking
about economics, he stops sounding
average.
Law and Economics
"I am interested in how legal
systems relate to economics," he says.
After Oxford, he plans to go to law
school and also earn a doctorate in
economics. Eventually, he would like
to work for an international agency,
dealing with developing economies. "I
want to combine the lawyer's problem
oriented approach with the technical
skill of the economist to work on
things like poverty law," he says.
South America and Africa are his
two greatest areas of interest. Page
spent three months in Chile this
summer studying the economic effects
of the international auto industry in
that country. The student economist,

who minored in Latin American
studies, received a grant from the
Center for Latin American Studies for
the survey. His research is being shaped
into a thesis this quarter. Page has a
part-time job as an economic research
assistant at the Food Research
Institute. He works mainly on African
problems, including the Nigerian
petroleum industry and the East
African Common Market.
Accidental Economics
Stanford's answer to Milton
Friedman started out as a history major
and got into economics by accident.
Spring quarter of his sophomore year
he registered for an 11 o'clock Spanish
class which turned out to be a loser. "I
needed a 5 unit class at 11, so I decided
to try Econ 1," he explains. He enjoyed
it sc much that he just kept on going.
The Rhodes winner hopes the
Oxford system will give him "more
time to reflect." He will read in eight
fields under the direction of a tutor.
There are no exams till the end of the
two years, when the crunch comes. "It
gets you away from learning in
water-tight compartments," Page says.
