## Hoover Holds UN Confab 
### 
A three-day conference on the United Nations
sponsored by the Hoover Institution will feature
speeches by distinguished diplomats and
internationally-known scholars along with an anti-war
protest this afternoon against former ambassador to
South Vietnam Henry Cabot Lodge, who will deliver
the opening address at 2 .
Entitled "The United Nations at 2 5 : Performance
and Progress," the conference will cover a broad
range of topics including an analysis of the U.N.'s
peacekeeping role, its charter, the U.S.'s own role in
the organization, and several reviews of the U.N.'s
past and plans for its future.
Among the most prominent speakers is Henry
Cabot Lodge who has served as ambassador to the
U.N., South Vietnam, Germany, and presently the
Vatican. He also served last year as head of the U.S.
delegation to the Paris Peace talks and was the
Republican candidate for vice-president in 1960.
In a rally called for 1:30 outside Dinkelspiel, the
protesters plan to draw attention to Lodge's role in
formulating war policies as ambassador to South
Vietnam and chief spokesman at the Paris talks.
W. Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover
Institution, will open the conference with a short
address today at 2 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium and will
introduce Lodge, who will speak on "The United
Nations in Perspective."
Tonight at 8:30 p.m. in Dinkelspiel, Lebanese
diplomat Charles H. Malik will talk on "The United
Nations as an Ideological Battleground."
Tomorrow at 10:15 a.m. in Bishop Auditorium in
the Business School, English economist Peter T.
Bauer will discuss "The Role of the United Nations in

Force" at 2 :30 p.m. in Cummings Auditorium.
At 8:30 p.m. former ambassador to NATO and

in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

on "Revision of the United Nations Charter" at

Planning for Peace."
