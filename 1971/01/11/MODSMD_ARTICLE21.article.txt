# Saigon Student Speaks
## 
### CARY GLASS 
"If I must go to prison again, that is 0.K."
remarked Dean van Toai, vice-president of the Saigon
Student Union, in a speech calling for immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam coupled
with free elections without "foreign interference,"
before a Jordan Hall audience Friday night.
Mr. Toai, who was referring to his arrest and jailing
by the South Vietnamese government during the
student strikes of March 1 970, spoke to an audience
of about 100 people under the sponsorship of
Concerned Asian Scholars at Stanford, East Asian
Studies Colloquium Committee, and Another Mother
for Peace.
He was on the last leg of an extensive meeting and
speaking tour which had previously taken him to
Paris and Washington, D.C.
In his remarks, characterized by a limited but
adequate command of English, Mr. Toai stressed that
the 1 968 elections which brought the Thieu-Ky
government to power were "fraudulent" and
"organized by the U.S. to show the world that there
is a free government in South Vietnam."

In Mr. Taoi's view, "opposition of students to the
Saigon government means opposition to the U.S.
also." He urged American students to exert pressure
on President Nixon to withdraw support from the
present Saigon government.
When asked about the relationship of the Saigon
Student Union to the NLF, Mr. Toai responded that
"We do not support the NLF. We do not oppose the
NLF. We join with the NLF in the liberation of South
Vietnam from American oppression and against
Thieu-Ky."
Mr. Toai added that he felt that some present i
members of the NLF had joined not because they I
support communism but because they had "no other J
place to go" in opposing the present government. •
These people, in Mr. Toai's opinion, might leave the j
NLF if the political situation changed.
.
Asked about what type of government he would j
like to see in Vietnam, Mr. Toai responded that the
"Vietnamese want a good government with a good
policy for the people ... I know that the present
government is bad. I do not know what it would be
like to live under a Communist government. . . Let
the people decide what government they wish."
Although pressed by questioners after the meeting,
Mr. Toai would not be more specific on this point.
In commenting on the present U.S. policy Mr.
Toai said, "Vietnamization means Vietnamese troops
kill Vietnamese." He added that "The U.S.
government spends $3 billion monthly in Vietnam
but the Vietnamese are still poor."
In responding to the situation, the Saigon Student
Union mounts prolonged student strikes, hunger
strikes, and public demonstrations. Efforts are
directed toward the long range, according to Mr.
Taoi, in contrast to "the American movement
(which) is very big but lasts only one day!"
Mr. Toai's remarks were preceded by the anti-war
film, "You Don't Have to Buy War, Mrs. Smith!"
sponsored by Another Mother for Peace and featuring
Bess Meverson Grant (that's right: Miss America of
1948 !)

present Saigon government.
When asked about the relationship of the Saigon
Student Union to the NLF, Mr. Toai responded that
"We do not support the NLF. We do not oppose the
NLF. We join with the NLF in the liberation of South
Vietnam from American oppression and against
Thieu-Ky."
Mr. Toai added that he felt that some present i
members of the NLF had joined not because they I
support communism but because they had "no other J
place to go" in opposing the present government. •
These people, in Mr. Toai's opinion, might leave the j
NLF if the political situation changed.
.
Asked about what type of government he would j
like to see in Vietnam, Mr. Toai responded that the
"Vietnamese want a good government with a good
policy for the people ... I know that the present
government is bad. I do not know what it would be
like to live under a Communist government. . . Let
the people decide what government they wish."
Although pressed by questioners after the meeting,
Mr. Toai would not be more specific on this point.
In commenting on the present U.S. policy Mr.
Toai said, "Vietnamization means Vietnamese troops
kill Vietnamese." He added that "The U.S.
government spends $3 billion monthly in Vietnam
but the Vietnamese are still poor."
In responding to the situation, the Saigon Student
Union mounts prolonged student strikes, hunger
strikes, and public demonstrations. Efforts are
directed toward the long range, according to Mr.
Taoi, in contrast to "the American movement
(which) is very big but lasts only one day!"
Mr. Toai's remarks were preceded by the anti-war
film, "You Don't Have to Buy War, Mrs. Smith!"
sponsored by Another Mother for Peace and featuring
Bess Meverson Grant (that's right: Miss America of
1948 !)
"If I must go to prison again, that is 0.K."
remarked Dean van Toai, vice-president of the Saigon
Student Union, in a speech calling for immediate
withdrawal of all U.S. troops from Vietnam coupled
with free elections without "foreign interference,"
before a Jordan Hall audience Friday night.
Mr. Toai, who was referring to his arrest and jailing
by the South Vietnamese government during the
student strikes of March 1 970, spoke to an audience
of about 100 people under the sponsorship of
Concerned Asian Scholars at Stanford, East Asian
Studies Colloquium Committee, and Another Mother
for Peace.
He was on the last leg of an extensive meeting and
speaking tour which had previously taken him to
Paris and Washington, D.C.
In his remarks, characterized by a limited but
adequate command of English, Mr. Toai stressed that
the 1 968 elections which brought the Thieu-Ky
government to power were "fraudulent" and
"organized by the U.S. to show the world that there
is a free government in South Vietnam."

In Mr. Taoi's view, "opposition of students to the
Saigon government means opposition to the U.S.
also." He urged American students to exert pressure
on President Nixon to withdraw support from the
present Saigon government.
When asked about the relationship of the Saigon
Student Union to the NLF, Mr. Toai responded that
"We do not support the NLF. We do not oppose the
