# Local Boy Makes Good With D.C. Dolly

### DEADMAN JON 
Tricia Nixon last night emphatically
denied reports that her rumored beau,
Edward Finch Cox, is a fictional
character being used to divert attention
from her real husband soon-to-be,
ASSU Council of Presidents member,
Patrick Carswell Shea.
"Oh Wally Hickel! It's totally false.
Cox is real," she exclaimed in rage.
At the Western White House
President Nixon had this to say about
that.
The rumor that Mr. Cox might in
fact be a pseudonym for Stanford's Pat.
C. Shea began late yesterday when
Daily reporter Warren G. Wonka read a
report in the Chronicle which stated
that an associate of Cox had described
him as "a nice guy but I can think of
more groovy people to turn on with."
Wonka immediately thought of
Shea.
No Spanish Republican
Wonka then discovered that last
summer Shea had written an article for
the San Diego Union entitled "Bringing
the War home," which was about tiie
Spanish Civil War and described how

Fascism could be established in
America.
Herb Klein, Presidential
Communications Director and former
editor of the Union, immediately
recognized Shea's mentality and
trought him to Washington where Pat
soon met Tricia.

But Miss Nixon claimed last night
that she had never even heard of Shea,
being in this respi ct somewhat more
fortunate than Stanford.
Sapphire Ring
It was first rumored that Miss Nixon
was engaged when Washington Star
society watcher Betty Beale reported

that Miss Nixon was wearing a sapphire
ring on her middle left finger.
Miss Beale is no relation to Miss
Panana Beale who appears in skin flicks
about fruits. It was Miss Beale,
however, who broke the story about
Miss Nixon wearing a wig. Although
that story turned out to be a wigged
rumor, judging from Miss Nixon's
recent remarks about Cox, it appears to
many observers that even if she doesn't
wear a hairpiece, she has been bald for
some time.
Edward Finch Cox, originally
rumored to be Miss Nixon's beau and
the one who gave her the ring, is said to
be the long lost brother of World War II
flying ace, Roger Will Cox.
What appears to many local
observers the most astounding part any
marital plans between Shea and Miss
Nixon is Miss Nixon's looks, bringing to
mind the opening words of the national
anthem, "Oh, Shea can you see?"
But whatever the case may or may
not be. Warren (i. Wonka has started a
further stir concerning Miss Nixon's
marital plans and students here at
Stanford are repeating that famous line
of Dumas in The Three Musketeers,
"To Shea?"

Shea.
No Spanish Republican
Wonka then discovered that last
summer Shea had written an article for
the San Diego Union entitled "Bringing
the War home," which was about tiie
Spanish Civil War and described how

Fascism could be established in
America.
Herb Klein, Presidential
Communications Director and former
editor of the Union, immediately
recognized Shea's mentality and
trought him to Washington where Pat
soon met Tricia.

But Miss Nixon claimed last night
that she had never even heard of Shea,
being in this respi ct somewhat more
fortunate than Stanford.
Sapphire Ring
It was first rumored that Miss Nixon
was engaged when Washington Star
society watcher Betty Beale reported

that Miss Nixon was wearing a sapphire
ring on her middle left finger.
Miss Beale is no relation to Miss
Panana Beale who appears in skin flicks
about fruits. It was Miss Beale,
however, who broke the story about
Miss Nixon wearing a wig. Although
that story turned out to be a wigged
rumor, judging from Miss Nixon's
recent remarks about Cox, it appears to
many observers that even if she doesn't
wear a hairpiece, she has been bald for
some time.
Edward Finch Cox, originally
rumored to be Miss Nixon's beau and
the one who gave her the ring, is said to
be the long lost brother of World War II
flying ace, Roger Will Cox.
What appears to many local
observers the most astounding part any
marital plans between Shea and Miss
Nixon is Miss Nixon's looks, bringing to
mind the opening words of the national
anthem, "Oh, Shea can you see?"
But whatever the case may or may
not be. Warren (i. Wonka has started a
further stir concerning Miss Nixon's
marital plans and students here at
Stanford are repeating that famous line
of Dumas in The Three Musketeers,
"To Shea?"

Tricia Nixon last night emphatically
denied reports that her rumored beau,
Edward Finch Cox, is a fictional
character being used to divert attention
from her real husband soon-to-be,
ASSU Council of Presidents member,
Patrick Carswell Shea.
"Oh Wally Hickel! It's totally false.
Cox is real," she exclaimed in rage.
At the Western White House
President Nixon had this to say about
that.
The rumor that Mr. Cox might in
fact be a pseudonym for Stanford's Pat.
C. Shea began late yesterday when
Daily reporter Warren G. Wonka read a
report in the Chronicle which stated
that an associate of Cox had described
him as "a nice guy but I can think of
more groovy people to turn on with."
Wonka immediately thought of
Shea.
