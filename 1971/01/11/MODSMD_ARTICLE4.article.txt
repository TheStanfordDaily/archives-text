# Lyman Cites Many Minority Needs
## 
### 
Programs for minority education
and employment at present leave the
University in no position to be
"self-righteous, complacent or
sentimental," President Richard W.
Lyman said Friday.
Addressing the quarterly meeting of
the Academic Council, Lyman said that
special studies programs were not good
enough, and that financial aid to rising
enrollment of minority students was
too thin.
The University's program in African
and Afro-American studies "does a lot
with limited resources," but "we
cannot be said to have embarked on
anything very ambitious in the way of
special studies programs designed to
acquaint students, whether from
minorities or not, with the problems of
people of color in America," Lyman
stated.
"If they had the resources, the
students could bring much more
assistance to their neighbors in the
community than now is the case, and
could do it with an absence of
condescension or of the barriers created
by perceived differences in background
and values whenever white Americans
try to take on such tasks in the
predominantly black society next
door," he added.
More Minority Employees
Although the number of black,
chicano, and American Indian
employees has more than doubled
(from 331 to 745 ) since 1968, "there
are fewer than one-half dozen minority
employees at Stanford in positions with
decision-making to hire and fire,"
declared Lyman.
Financial aid to minority
undergraduates has tripled in three
years, but it will have to increase even
more to support the growing minority
enrollment, Lyman said. Presently all
but 11 of 4 00 minority undergraduates
here receive some financial aid.
"Support for minorities is no longer

news," Lyman commented, "and in
this age of future shock, all too much
of the time what isn't news just isn't -
period." During the past three years,
faculty and student support for the
Martin Luther King Fund, which
finances minority scholarships, has
dwindled from $5 8,5 000 to $40,000
annually.
Minority Grad Students
Additional funds will be required to
support rising enrollment of minority
students at the graduate level.
"No doubt community colleges -
and state colleges and universities too -
will have major roles in ending the
tragic impoverishment of our national
life through the excludion of ethnic
minorities," declared Lyman.

"But no national program . . . can
make much sense if it does not include
a sizeable commitment by Universities
such as Stanford to open the doors to
the professions by educating the
disadvantaged beyond a baccalaureate
degree.
"At a time when graduate student
support from federal and foundation
sources alike is being sharply curtailed,
the problem of maintaining momentum
in this critically important sector of the
University is serious indeed," Lyman
added.
On a broader basis, he noted, "the
deeper long-run trend are not basically
very favorable" for higher education,
especially on the financial front.

"We are not merely waiting out a
rainy day, with the barometer reading
bright and fair for tomorrow," he
noted.
"We simply cannot expect a
resumption of the startling increases we
knew up until a couple of years ago in
the percentage of the country's wealth
allocated to higher education year after
year."
The 1 971 -72 operating budget is
expected to increase about $5 million,
but, according to Lyman, "despite such
seemingly impressive growth, these
additional dollars enable us to do very
little more than give wage and salary
increases that are, generally speaking,
wiped out by inflation as soon as they
are instituted."
