## Bok Named Harvard President 
### PHIL LIND 
The Harvard Corporation yesterday
selected Derek Curtis Bok, the dean of
the Harvard Law School, as its nominee
for the presidency of Harvard
University.
Unless there are complications in the
technical election process, Bok, who
graduated from Stanford, will have
been formally chosen tonight as the
25 th president of the 334-year old
university, oldest in the country.
The search for a successor to Dr.
Nathan M. Pusey, president since 195 4
and who will retire this June, has been
conducted by five members of the
Harvard Corporation, the university's
day-to-day governing body.
To elect Dean Bok formally, the
Corporation now requires both the
permission and"council and consent"

of Harvard's other governing body, the
Board of Overseers.
Three men associated with Stanford
remained on the final list of 23
candidates for the presidency. David
Hamburg, Wolfgang Panofsky, and
Donald Kennedy were included in the
list, which was reduced from a list of
6 9 names announced last November 2 0.
Hamburg is chairman of the Medical
School's Department of Psychiatry and
chairman of the faculty's Presidential
Search Committee last summer.
Panofsky is director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and
Kennedy is chairman of the
Department of Biological Sciences.
A spokesman for the Harvard
Corporation said that its members had
"not elected the next president of
Harvard and will have no comment on
the situation until they do so."

The New York Times yesterday
described this statement as being only
technically correct. The Corporation
cannot formally vote on Mr. Bok until
it gets permission to hold an election
from the Board of Overseers. However,
many sources indicate that the choice
of Dean Bok has already been made.
A number of newspapers, including
two Harvard student papers, the Boston
Globe, and the New York Times had
reported that Mr. Bok was the leading
candidate.
Dean Bok, who is 40 years old, has
been dean of the Harvard Law School
since 1968 and a member of the faculty
since 1958 . He is an authority on labor
law.
He is not a graduate of Harvard
College, having received his bachelor's
degree from Stanford. He graduated
with high honors from Harvard Law
School in 1 95 4.
Every Harvard president since the
17 th century has been a graduate of
Harvard College.
According to Scott Jacobs, news
editor of the Harvard Crimson, Derk
Bok is an "excellent choice for the
presidency."
"He is by far better than most of the
other candidates," declared Jacobs
yesterday."He seems to be satisfactory
for most of the Harvard community."
Jacobs also commented on Bok's
"ability to get people to like him." "He
is a very schrewd man and very much in
the Kingman Brewster (president of
Yale) mold. Bok has a good sense of
timing and knows just what to say at
the right time."
His selection by the Harvard
Corporation follows what Harvard
officials describe as "an exhaustive
search." It began last April with a
mailing to 203,000 faculty, students,
alumni, and employees of Harvard and
Radcliffe, the sister school also in
Cambridge.
By September, 1,100 names had
been collected together with a range of
views as to the qualifications desirable
for the new president.
By late November, a corporation
committee had reduced the list to 69,
and. by December, to 23. All those on
(his final list were in the academic
world.

been collected together with a range of
views as to the qualifications desirable
for the new president.
By late November, a corporation
committee had reduced the list to 69,
and. by December, to 23. All those on
(his final list were in the academic
world.
The Harvard Corporation yesterday
selected Derek Curtis Bok, the dean of
the Harvard Law School, as its nominee
for the presidency of Harvard
University.
Unless there are complications in the
technical election process, Bok, who
graduated from Stanford, will have
been formally chosen tonight as the
25 th president of the 334-year old
university, oldest in the country.
The search for a successor to Dr.
Nathan M. Pusey, president since 195 4
and who will retire this June, has been
conducted by five members of the
Harvard Corporation, the university's
day-to-day governing body.
To elect Dean Bok formally, the
Corporation now requires both the
permission and"council and consent"

of Harvard's other governing body, the
Board of Overseers.
Three men associated with Stanford
remained on the final list of 23
candidates for the presidency. David
Hamburg, Wolfgang Panofsky, and
Donald Kennedy were included in the
list, which was reduced from a list of
6 9 names announced last November 2 0.
Hamburg is chairman of the Medical
School's Department of Psychiatry and
chairman of the faculty's Presidential
Search Committee last summer.
Panofsky is director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and
Kennedy is chairman of the
Department of Biological Sciences.
A spokesman for the Harvard
Corporation said that its members had
"not elected the next president of
Harvard and will have no comment on
the situation until they do so."

The New York Times yesterday
described this statement as being only
technically correct. The Corporation
cannot formally vote on Mr. Bok until
it gets permission to hold an election
from the Board of Overseers. However,
many sources indicate that the choice
of Dean Bok has already been made.
A number of newspapers, including
two Harvard student papers, the Boston
Globe, and the New York Times had
reported that Mr. Bok was the leading
candidate.
Dean Bok, who is 40 years old, has
been dean of the Harvard Law School
since 1968 and a member of the faculty
since 1958 . He is an authority on labor
law.
He is not a graduate of Harvard
College, having received his bachelor's
degree from Stanford. He graduated
with high honors from Harvard Law
School in 1 95 4.
Every Harvard president since the
17 th century has been a graduate of
Harvard College.
According to Scott Jacobs, news
editor of the Harvard Crimson, Derk
Bok is an "excellent choice for the
presidency."
"He is by far better than most of the
other candidates," declared Jacobs
yesterday."He seems to be satisfactory
for most of the Harvard community."
Jacobs also commented on Bok's
"ability to get people to like him." "He
is a very schrewd man and very much in
the Kingman Brewster (president of
Yale) mold. Bok has a good sense of
timing and knows just what to say at
the right time."
His selection by the Harvard
Corporation follows what Harvard
officials describe as "an exhaustive
search." It began last April with a
mailing to 203,000 faculty, students,
alumni, and employees of Harvard and
Radcliffe, the sister school also in
Cambridge.
By September, 1,100 names had
been collected together with a range of
views as to the qualifications desirable
for the new president.
