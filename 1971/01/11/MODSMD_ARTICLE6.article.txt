## Real War Criminal 
### 
the grand inquisitor

"We have to open up the heads
of the Vietnamese people and
pour the essence of democracy
into it."
Henry Cabot Lodge
Henry Cabot Lodge is a
professional peace-keeper. He is
also a war criminal . . . These two
roles, necessary in the foreign
policy of an empire at war, are
not contradictory. In fact cold
war history is revealing that they
are one and the same. In 1 963,
after 7 years as a major advocate
of "world peace"—U.N.
Ambassador, 1 953-1960— Lodge
accepted his appointment as
Ambassador to South Vietnam
only on the condition that he
"control all aspects of American
policy there, including the
military."
According to Lodge himself

the ambassador is overseer of the
entire U.S. mission in South
Vietnam. During his tenure there
(1 963-64, 1 965 -67 ) the U.S.
backed the assassination of Ngo
Diem Diem, increased the U.S.
presence from 1 6,000 "advisers"
to half a million men, and
escalated into the fullscale
win-the-war effort with genocidal
strategies of forced urbanization,
free-fire zones, total ecocide of
the countryside, and bombing of
North and South Vietnam as well
as Laos and Cambodian. Rather
than considering withdrawal",
Lodge in a February 1965
interview noted with optimistic
statisfaction that there was much
that could be done to North
Vietnam, short of nuclear war,
that would "cause much pain and
anguish ... and a great deal of

damage." In fact, he said then
that the U.S. might be justified in
staying in Vietnam even if the
Saigon government asked it to
leave.
Telford Taylor, chief
prosecutor at Nuremburg, stated
last week on television that all the
American policies in Southeast
Asia are criminal acts of war as
defined by the Nuremberg and
Tokyo war crimes tribunals. He
implied that if tried civilian as
well as military leaders responsible
for the war tragedy would be
convicted by the Nuremberg
principles.
Why would Lodge, a man so
well aware of the consequences of
such policies continue to support
them? Why should a man of such
ostensibly impeccable diplomatic
and social credentials hy himself
so obviously open to war criminal
charges by his words and actions?
As one of the wealthiest rulers of
the Americans empire, Lodge has
often made clear many of the
reasons behind his interest in
maintaining American influence in
Vietnam. For instance, while
Ambassador in S. Vietnam in
Boston Globe quotes him:
"He who holds or has influence
in Vietnam can affect the future
of the Phillipines and Formosa to
the east, Thailand and Burma with
their huge rice surpluses to the
west, and Malaysia and Indonesia
with their rubber vacuum—from it
large storehouses of wealth and
population can be influenced and
undermined."
Although no longer in charge
of our mission in Vietnam, Lodge
still maintains prominent
influence and control over the
continuing genocide. In a recent
letter to the Pope, Vietnamese
catholic leader Ngo Cong Due
shocked the world by indicating
that Lodge, who is now
Ambassador to the Vatican, has
been largely responsible for the
Pope's silence about the massacres
and the escalating war. Due
charges: "The Church remains
silent because it well knows that
were it to voice disapproval, the
regime would automatically
collapse . . . The presence in the
Vatican of Mr. Cabot Lodge as
your informant is in reality
disastrous."
Two decades of total war
against the entire population of
Vietnam—not to mention the
massive destruction of Laos and
Cambodia—is to date history's
most monstrous crime against
peace and humanity. The attempt
to scapegoat Calley and for others
for individual massacres when
millions of Asians have been
murdered, aimed, and made
homeless by policies formulated
and perpetrated by such national
leaders as Eisenhower, Nixon,
Kennedy, Lodge, Johnson, an
should not be tolerated by the
American public. It is time we
started confronting the real war
criminals, without who My Lai
would never have even been a
possibility.

Why would Lodge, a man so
well aware of the consequences of
such policies continue to support
them? Why should a man of such
ostensibly impeccable diplomatic
and social credentials hy himself
so obviously open to war criminal
charges by his words and actions?
As one of the wealthiest rulers of
the Americans empire, Lodge has
often made clear many of the
reasons behind his interest in
maintaining American influence in
Vietnam. For instance, while
Ambassador in S. Vietnam in
Boston Globe quotes him:
"He who holds or has influence
in Vietnam can affect the future
of the Phillipines and Formosa to
the east, Thailand and Burma with
their huge rice surpluses to the
west, and Malaysia and Indonesia
with their rubber vacuum—from it
large storehouses of wealth and
population can be influenced and
undermined."
Although no longer in charge
of our mission in Vietnam, Lodge
still maintains prominent
influence and control over the
continuing genocide. In a recent
letter to the Pope, Vietnamese
catholic leader Ngo Cong Due
shocked the world by indicating
that Lodge, who is now
Ambassador to the Vatican, has
been largely responsible for the
Pope's silence about the massacres
and the escalating war. Due
charges: "The Church remains
silent because it well knows that
were it to voice disapproval, the
regime would automatically
collapse . . . The presence in the
Vatican of Mr. Cabot Lodge as
your informant is in reality
disastrous."
Two decades of total war
against the entire population of
Vietnam—not to mention the
massive destruction of Laos and
Cambodia—is to date history's
most monstrous crime against
peace and humanity. The attempt
to scapegoat Calley and for others
for individual massacres when
millions of Asians have been
murdered, aimed, and made
homeless by policies formulated
and perpetrated by such national
leaders as Eisenhower, Nixon,
Kennedy, Lodge, Johnson, an
should not be tolerated by the
American public. It is time we
started confronting the real war
criminals, without who My Lai
would never have even been a
possibility.

"We have to open up the heads
of the Vietnamese people and

into it."
Henry Cabot Lodge
Henry Cabot Lodge is a
professional peace-keeper. He is
also a war criminal . . . These two
roles, necessary in the foreign
policy of an empire at war, are
not contradictory. In fact cold
war history is revealing that they
are one and the same. In 1 963,
after 7 years as a major advocate
of "world peace"—U.N.
Ambassador, 1 953-1960— Lodge
accepted his appointment as
Ambassador to South Vietnam
only on the condition that he
"control all aspects of American
policy there, including the
military."
According to Lodge himself

the ambassador is overseer of the
entire U.S. mission in South
Vietnam. During his tenure there
(1 963-64, 1 965 -67 ) the U.S.
backed the assassination of Ngo
Diem Diem, increased the U.S.
presence from 1 6,000 "advisers"
to half a million men, and
escalated into the fullscale
win-the-war effort with genocidal
strategies of forced urbanization,
free-fire zones, total ecocide of
the countryside, and bombing of
North and South Vietnam as well
as Laos and Cambodian. Rather
than considering withdrawal",
Lodge in a February 1965
interview noted with optimistic
statisfaction that there was much
that could be done to North
Vietnam, short of nuclear war,
that would "cause much pain and
anguish ... and a great deal of

damage." In fact, he said then
that the U.S. might be justified in
staying in Vietnam even if the
Saigon government asked it to
leave.
Telford Taylor, chief
prosecutor at Nuremburg, stated
last week on television that all the
American policies in Southeast
Asia are criminal acts of war as
defined by the Nuremberg and
Tokyo war crimes tribunals. He
implied that if tried civilian as
well as military leaders responsible
for the war tragedy would be
convicted by the Nuremberg
principles.
Why would Lodge, a man so
well aware of the consequences of
such policies continue to support
them? Why should a man of such
