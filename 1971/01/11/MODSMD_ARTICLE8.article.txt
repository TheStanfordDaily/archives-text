## Myths About Pollution 
### 
Barry wood

The problems of dealing with
overpopulation are daily hindered
by myths held by intelligent
people. Many of these myths
consist of elaborate ways of
sidestepping the real problem.
Moreover, since many of these
myths are propogated by
educated middle-class Americans,
they look like rationalizations for
maintaining the status quo.
Thus overpopulation comes
out as somebody else's problem—a
condition found in China, India,
Africa, South America, Japan.
This logic leads many
well-meaning people into thinking
that the U.S. is in fact
"underpopulated," an opinion
supported with descriptions of the
vast reaches of this land still
untouched by the plow.
This attitude is one of the most
dangerous ones around, and is
often followed with the notion
that it is up to the "intelligent"
and "educated" people (read:
middle-class Americans) to keep
having children. American
children are, after all, the last
hope of the world, and are needed
to cope with the problems of too
many underprivileged Blacks,
Browns, and Yellows. This
position, which sounds like
democratic equality to most
whites, comes out as pure racism
to the Third World. This is the
white rabbit myth, a rare bit of
white rabbit propoganda.
Another population myth
concludes that the real problem is
not population numbers but
population density. Exponents of
this position point to the
incredible conditions found in
American cities, which have
become breeding grounds for
crime and disease, family
breakdown and suicide—not to
mention the ecosystems
overburdened by smog, sewage,
and garbage.
Properly understood, this
argument should lead to some
realistic plan to limit the size of
cities and reduce the size of huge
monstrosities like LA, New York,
or Chicago. No such plan now
exists. Indeed, there are now some
dozens of new cities on the
drawing boards for this country,
designed to house 100 million
more people in the next 30 years.
The logic behind these new
cities, however, is typical of the
myopia behind most American
"progress." Using population
statistics to define "needs" we
rush ahead to provide facilities.
This kind of accomodation to
population pressure is really a
system of total un-control. Behind

the smoke screen the population
question still lurks, and will lurk
perhaps until it is too late.
The most dangerous facts in
the hands of the myth makers are
the isolated statistics which seem
to hold out hope. We are told the
birth rate is falling. We are told
that the world does, at the
moment, produce enough food to
feed everyone at the standards
established by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.
The fact is, however, that we
are unable to distribute this food
with any degree of equality. In a
world producing food with a
margin of only 3%, the developed
countries are overfed while 1
billion people are chronically
hungry and 10 to 20 are dying of
malnutrition or starvation every
year. Moreover, a falling birth rate
means little in the U.S., where we
are adding 2 million people each
year.
Overpopulation is not a
problem in isolation—there is no
single key to environmental issues.
Overpopulation is not pure
numbers of people, but "numbers
of people pressing against values."
The U.S. citizen consumes 5 0
times as much as an Indonesian

citizen, which means that people
in the U.S. press 5 0 times as hard
against values. This suggests that
the U.S. may well be the most
"overpopulated" nation in the
world— evidenced by the fact that
we are now draining the resources
of peoples around the globe.
The question of population
growth and overpopulation will
not be resolved until some basic
attitudes are changed and myths
debunked. In our evolutionary
past the survival of the species
depended on a birth rate high
enough to ensure a population
increase. This is true of most
species. Roman Catholic attitudes
to birth control still reflect this
basic attitude. So does our
economics, which can only survive
by growing!
But the survival of the human
race has long since been
assured—ever since men developed
tools, tamed fire, and invented
language. Population growth is no
longer a survival mechanism but a
positive liability. Overpopulated
communities of rats and rabbits
develop aggressive behavior. In
extreme cases, rats retreat into a
coma. The crush of
overpopulation could lead us into
global war or global famine,

murderous aggression or mental
stagnation.
Ultimately, any plea for a sane
approach to population control is
a call to exercise rational means
rather than letting the irrational
tide of instinct hold sway. To call
population control "genocide" is
merely to obscure the mass
suicide implicit in our present
failure to act.
It is impossible to predict the
outcome of too many people on
this earth. It is impossible to
determine the point of no return.
But we can point to the millions
who now die for lack of food, and
we can project the chaos to result
if men are forced to retreat into
the instinctive behavior of
physical survival. Behind all the
myths lie some very simple facts:
"civilization" rests on the frail
supports of air and food and
water, and a decent place to
stand.

The problems of dealing with
overpopulation are daily hindered
by myths held by intelligent
people. Many of these myths
consist of elaborate ways of
sidestepping the real problem.
Moreover, since many of these
myths are propogated by
educated middle-class Americans,
they look like rationalizations for
maintaining the status quo.
Thus overpopulation comes
out as somebody else's problem—a
condition found in China, India,
Africa, South America, Japan.
This logic leads many
well-meaning people into thinking
that the U.S. is in fact
"underpopulated," an opinion
supported with descriptions of the
vast reaches of this land still
untouched by the plow.
This attitude is one of the most
dangerous ones around, and is
often followed with the notion
that it is up to the "intelligent"
and "educated" people (read:
middle-class Americans) to keep
having children. American
children are, after all, the last
hope of the world, and are needed
to cope with the problems of too
many underprivileged Blacks,
Browns, and Yellows. This
position, which sounds like
democratic equality to most
whites, comes out as pure racism
to the Third World. This is the
white rabbit myth, a rare bit of
white rabbit propoganda.
Another population myth
concludes that the real problem is
not population numbers but
population density. Exponents of
this position point to the
incredible conditions found in
American cities, which have
become breeding grounds for
crime and disease, family
breakdown and suicide—not to
mention the ecosystems
overburdened by smog, sewage,
and garbage.
Properly understood, this
argument should lead to some
realistic plan to limit the size of
cities and reduce the size of huge
monstrosities like LA, New York,
or Chicago. No such plan now
exists. Indeed, there are now some
dozens of new cities on the
drawing boards for this country,
designed to house 100 million
more people in the next 30 years.
The logic behind these new
cities, however, is typical of the
myopia behind most American
"progress." Using population
statistics to define "needs" we
rush ahead to provide facilities.
This kind of accomodation to
population pressure is really a
system of total un-control. Behind

the smoke screen the population
question still lurks, and will lurk
perhaps until it is too late.
The most dangerous facts in
the hands of the myth makers are
the isolated statistics which seem
to hold out hope. We are told the
birth rate is falling. We are told
that the world does, at the
moment, produce enough food to
feed everyone at the standards
established by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.
The fact is, however, that we
are unable to distribute this food
with any degree of equality. In a
world producing food with a
margin of only 3%, the developed
countries are overfed while 1
billion people are chronically
hungry and 10 to 20 are dying of
malnutrition or starvation every
year. Moreover, a falling birth rate
means little in the U.S., where we
are adding 2 million people each
year.
Overpopulation is not a
problem in isolation—there is no
single key to environmental issues.
Overpopulation is not pure
numbers of people, but "numbers
of people pressing against values."
The U.S. citizen consumes 5 0
times as much as an Indonesian

citizen, which means that people
in the U.S. press 5 0 times as hard
against values. This suggests that
the U.S. may well be the most
"overpopulated" nation in the
world— evidenced by the fact that
we are now draining the resources
of peoples around the globe.
The question of population
growth and overpopulation will
not be resolved until some basic
attitudes are changed and myths
debunked. In our evolutionary
past the survival of the species
depended on a birth rate high
enough to ensure a population
increase. This is true of most
species. Roman Catholic attitudes
to birth control still reflect this
basic attitude. So does our
economics, which can only survive
by growing!
But the survival of the human
race has long since been
assured—ever since men developed
tools, tamed fire, and invented
language. Population growth is no
longer a survival mechanism but a
positive liability. Overpopulated
communities of rats and rabbits
develop aggressive behavior. In
extreme cases, rats retreat into a
coma. The crush of
overpopulation could lead us into
global war or global famine,

murderous aggression or mental
stagnation.
Ultimately, any plea for a sane
approach to population control is
a call to exercise rational means
rather than letting the irrational
tide of instinct hold sway. To call
population control "genocide" is
merely to obscure the mass

debunked. In our evolutionary
past the survival of the species
depended on a birth rate high
enough to ensure a population
increase. This is true of most
species. Roman Catholic attitudes
to birth control still reflect this
basic attitude. So does our
economics, which can only survive
by growing!
But the survival of the human
race has long since been
assured—ever since men developed
tools, tamed fire, and invented
language. Population growth is no
longer a survival mechanism but a
positive liability. Overpopulated
communities of rats and rabbits
develop aggressive behavior. In
extreme cases, rats retreat into a
coma. The crush of
overpopulation could lead us into
global war or global famine,

murderous aggression or mental
stagnation.
Ultimately, any plea for a sane
approach to population control is
a call to exercise rational means
rather than letting the irrational
tide of instinct hold sway. To call
population control "genocide" is
merely to obscure the mass
suicide implicit in our present
failure to act.
It is impossible to predict the
outcome of too many people on
this earth. It is impossible to
determine the point of no return.
But we can point to the millions
who now die for lack of food, and
we can project the chaos to result
if men are forced to retreat into
the instinctive behavior of
physical survival. Behind all the
myths lie some very simple facts:
"civilization" rests on the frail
supports of air and food and
water, and a decent place to
stand.

The problems of dealing with
overpopulation are daily hindered
by myths held by intelligent
people. Many of these myths
consist of elaborate ways of
sidestepping the real problem.
Moreover, since many of these
myths are propogated by
educated middle-class Americans,
they look like rationalizations for
maintaining the status quo.
Thus overpopulation comes
out as somebody else's problem—a
condition found in China, India,
Africa, South America, Japan.
This logic leads many
well-meaning people into thinking
that the U.S. is in fact
"underpopulated," an opinion
supported with descriptions of the
vast reaches of this land still
untouched by the plow.
This attitude is one of the most
dangerous ones around, and is
often followed with the notion
that it is up to the "intelligent"
and "educated" people (read:
middle-class Americans) to keep
having children. American
children are, after all, the last
hope of the world, and are needed
to cope with the problems of too
many underprivileged Blacks,
Browns, and Yellows. This
position, which sounds like
democratic equality to most
whites, comes out as pure racism
to the Third World. This is the
white rabbit myth, a rare bit of
white rabbit propoganda.
Another population myth
concludes that the real problem is
not population numbers but
population density. Exponents of
this position point to the
incredible conditions found in
American cities, which have
become breeding grounds for
crime and disease, family
breakdown and suicide—not to
mention the ecosystems
overburdened by smog, sewage,
and garbage.
Properly understood, this
argument should lead to some
realistic plan to limit the size of
cities and reduce the size of huge
monstrosities like LA, New York,
or Chicago. No such plan now
exists. Indeed, there are now some
dozens of new cities on the
drawing boards for this country,
designed to house 100 million
more people in the next 30 years.
The logic behind these new
cities, however, is typical of the
myopia behind most American
"progress." Using population
statistics to define "needs" we
rush ahead to provide facilities.
This kind of accomodation to
population pressure is really a
system of total un-control. Behind

the smoke screen the population
question still lurks, and will lurk
perhaps until it is too late.
The most dangerous facts in
the hands of the myth makers are
the isolated statistics which seem
to hold out hope. We are told the
birth rate is falling. We are told
that the world does, at the
moment, produce enough food to
feed everyone at the standards
established by the Food and
Agriculture Organization of the
United Nations.
The fact is, however, that we
are unable to distribute this food
with any degree of equality. In a
world producing food with a
margin of only 3%, the developed
countries are overfed while 1
billion people are chronically
hungry and 10 to 20 are dying of
malnutrition or starvation every
year. Moreover, a falling birth rate
means little in the U.S., where we
are adding 2 million people each
year.
Overpopulation is not a
problem in isolation—there is no
single key to environmental issues.
Overpopulation is not pure
numbers of people, but "numbers
of people pressing against values."
The U.S. citizen consumes 5 0
times as much as an Indonesian

citizen, which means that people
in the U.S. press 5 0 times as hard
against values. This suggests that
the U.S. may well be the most
"overpopulated" nation in the
world— evidenced by the fact that
we are now draining the resources
of peoples around the globe.
The question of population
growth and overpopulation will
not be resolved until some basic
attitudes are changed and myths
debunked. In our evolutionary

depended on a birth rate high
enough to ensure a population
increase. This is true of most
