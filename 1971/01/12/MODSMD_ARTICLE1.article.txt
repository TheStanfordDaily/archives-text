# Hecklers Break Up Lodge Talk
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Loud angry yells from a scattered
group of 150 hecklers forced Henry
Cabot Lodge, former ambassador to
South Vietnam and to the United
Nations, to interrupt his speech
yesterday afternoon after repeated
attempts to quiet the crowd failed.
Lodge had barely started his talk
when cries of "pig" and "war criminal"
along with whistling and rhythmic
clapping prevented him from
continuing. "Keep right on going, I'm
used to it,"he said.
When the hecklers refused to calm
down, W. Glenn Campbell, director of
the Hoover Institution which sponsored
the speech, took the podium and
declared, "If you won't listen to the
ambassador, I ask you to leave." He
was met with more boos and epithets.
Campbell then announced that the
speech was cancelled. The former head
of the U.S. delegation to the Paris
Peace Talks later spoke to a closed
gathering of 1 00 Hoover staff members.
Continued Heckling
Campbell's opening remarks to the
overflow audience of 8 00 were
peppered by continued heckling, many
focusing on the alleged right-wing
research done by the Hoover

Institution. Soon others in the audience
began to shout back at the hecklers
demanding they be quiet.
When Lodge was introduced, nearly
half the audience stood to applaud
while the boos and shouts increased.
One student who quieted the
auditorium momemtarily received a
loud ovation when he asked the
hecklers, "Are you people afraid to let
us hear what he has to say?"
One protester rejoined, "Are you
afraid of the people of the world?"
Then a long chant of "Power to the
People" gave way to the loud yells that
eventually halted Lodge's talk.
Afraid of Truth?
The Vatican envoy later commented
that the disruption "speaks for
itself. . . they're afraid of the truth."
In ending the talk, Campbell said the
disruption was "a sad day in the history
of Stanford." The audience, by now
bitterly divided over the heckling,
thinned down afterwards into several
large clusters of debaters who argued
the incident vehemently for more than
an hour.
Prior to the speech, 125 people
listened outside Dinkelspiel to grad
student Janet Weiss who branded
Lodge a "war criminal." She added,
"Wherever (Lodge) goes, there are

going to be people there to prevent him
from carrying on his piggery."
Bomb Threat
At 1 :30 p.m. firemen and Santa
Clara police cleared the auditorium
after receiving a bomb threat. They
made a complete search of the building
without finding anything.
In a later statement, President
Richard Lyman said that the
administration would "make every
possible effort to identify those who
took part in the disruption and bring
appropriate charges."
He added, "It is ironic and sad that
this kind of totalitarian action should
take place at a meeting called to honor
the 25 th anniversary of the United
Nations—an organization that has held
the hopes of so many for freedom and
peace."
Two Students
John Schwartz, special assistant to
the president in charge of disciplinary
affairs, told the Daily that at least two
students will be charged before the
Stanford Judicial Council with
disrupting Lodge's speech. He said that
the University would use photographs
and individual testimony in charging
others.
Prof. Sanford E. Dornbusch,

chairman of the Faculty Senate, said:
"I am personally opposed to the
policies that Mr. Lodge has stood for in
Vietnam, but this doesn't give me or
anyone else the right to interfere with
his freedom to talk and others' freedom
to here.
"Any faculty, staff or students who
participated in this afternoon's attack
upon intellectual freedom are attacking
values that this university and society
have long labored to develop and
cannot lightly lose," he said.
Southeast Asian Policy
In a letter to the Daily printed on
page 2, students Gerry Foote and Merle
Rabine defended the continual
interruptions. "If the audience in
Dinkelspiel had remained silent while
he spoke, we would have been showing
our support for the policy which he
engineered in Southeast Asia," they
claimed.
The University News Service later
reported that Lodge asked to deliver his
scheduled address to a small closed
group of Hoover staff members. In his
speech in the Cummings Art
Auditorium the tall, urbane diplomat
declared that the world has become

BEGINNING AND END—Henry Cabot Lodge, U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican
and former ambassador to Vietnam, folds the pages of his prepared speech before
leaving the podium yesterday shortly after he began his speech. Lodge, speaking at
Dinkelspiel, was shouted down by approximately 150 hecklers.
"too small and too dangerous" for the
U.N. to either "keep out or throw out"
established governments.
Discussing the U.S.'s long-standing
policy of opposition to Communist
China's admission to the U.N., Lodge
said, "The U.S. has as strong an interest
as any other country in ending
Mainland China's isolation and bringing
her into the family of nations."
Mainland China
However, he added, "It must be said
that relations between Mainland China
and the government of Taipei must be
taken into account, and that expulsion
of the Taipei government from the
U.N. would be a serious mistake."
Lodge also called on the U.S. and
Russia to "avoid sarcasm and invective"
and to "strive for agreement." He felt
that "we can hope for something better
than the adversarial relationships which
have marked-and marred—the past 25

years of the United Nations history."
Appearing calm and unruffled by the
heckling a few hours before, he spoke
in assured, unhurried tones. After his
talk, Lodge met with admirers who
shook hands and offered their apologies
for his interrupted speech.
Pushy Minority
Asked after his talk what he thought
of the hecklers, he commented, "1
don't see why they let the majority get
pushed around by the minority. This
isn't free speech."
Visibly annoyed that his earlier
speech had been interrupted, he asked
associate provost Robert Rosensweig,
"Why didn't you just clear the
galleries?"
Rosensweig responded that the
police claimed they did not have
sufficient numbers. "I know you think
it was right, but I don't, " Lodge said.
He shook several more hands and
then left escorted by several plain
clothes police bodyguards.
