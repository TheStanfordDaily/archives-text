The founders of the United
Nations, wanting in the words of
the charter, to "save succeeding
generations from the scourge of
war" were vividly impressed with

the need to state in advance that
there would be actual
"suppression of acts of
aggression." The founders, for the
most part were men who had seen
the Kaiser bring about World War
I. All had seen Hitler bring about

World War 11.
It was this way of thinking
which led many men who could
remember Hitler to believe that
first a covert and then an overt
aggression had been committed
against South Vietnam which, if
not suppressed, would threaten
the great East Asian arc which
stretches from Japan to Indonesia
and Australia.
It is hardly necessary to say
that this idea of suppressing local
aggressions in order to prevent
large wars has fallen into
disrepute—if indeed it has not
become a dead letter altogether.

At the United Nations, because
its first principle is juridical and
governmental, there is the subtlest
rivalry between these two
fundamental ideological
orientations: strict Roman
legalism championed by America
and Europe, and extra-legal
culturalism, championed
principally by the Soviet Union,
but also especially congenial to

most of the rest of the
non-Wesworld. This is indeed a
fateful rivalry.
Roman legalism is conservative
and in a sense reactionary;
extra-legal culturalism is distinctly
revolutionary—it provokes and
awaits disruptions from below.
The fundamental regulative
idea of almost every communist
speech and intervention at the
United Nations, with the audience
being the entire world, is to
appeal to the masses, to ripen the
class consciousness of the
proletariat, to incite the world
revolution.
The greatest thing that America
and the West must face up to now
is the terrible moral rot that has
crept into Western
existence—radical hedonism in
living, the worship of instruments
and things, the terrible decline of
reason, the quest of the moment,
the rebellion against truth and
value especially in the universities,
moral irresponsibility, the
destruction or order and respect,
the disappearance of shame and
honor, the voluptuous flirtation
with death itself.
