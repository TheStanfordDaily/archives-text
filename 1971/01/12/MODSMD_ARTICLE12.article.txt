Although the Features Page is
intended to provide the campus
community with information on
cultural and other events of
interest, operating within as broad
a scope as possible, the current
space squeeze necessitated by the
Daily :'s precarious financial
condition has required that
certain limits be set on the nature
of material which will be accepted
for the features section of the
paper.
Most importantly, the features
page is not a means of securing
free publicity for any event. Any
material which is viewed by the
editor as constituting advertising,
without the usual financial
compensation, will not be
accepted.
Secondly, although it is realized
that many events of interest and
significance are worthy of
consideration, space limitations
require that only those events
considered to be of the greatest
general interest can be covered by
the Daily. Hopefully, potential
contributors will understand and
cooperate with these constraints.
