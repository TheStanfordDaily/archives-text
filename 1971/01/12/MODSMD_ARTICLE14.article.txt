# New 'Sequoia' On Sale
## 
### VICKY CALLERY 
What can you say about a
college literary magazine? That it
contains poetry, prose and
photography reflecting the
current literary and philosophical
trends of the school; that its
format lends an overall unity to
the varied genre, that it includes
contributions from freshmen, a
graduate student in creative
writing, and a Stanford Professor?
This term's "Sequoia"
encompasses a wide range of
creative talent.
Three short stories and
numerous poems are connected
by illustrative photographs which
were taken on or near the campus.
The varied themes of individual
works are thereby integrated as
manifestations of an overall

experience which is relevant to
what people are thinking and
doing on this particular campus.
For example, a whimsical poem
with a subtle ending twist (The
Bears" by Hanna Zim) is followed
by Professor Donald Davie's "A
Christian Hero" which questions
the value of conventional religious
training.
Next comes Jeff Weil's "A
Short Course in Topology", a
short story exploring the mind of
long-distance runner Paul whose
stream of consciousness
alternately focuses upon the
strategy of the race and upon
Wendy Bettler's "weather ballon"
breasts. Photographs by Marty
Ollstein present several views of
the backside of an increasingly
tired runner who seems to be
running away from his thoughts as
he approaches the finishing line.

Two poems by Fniiip Feldman
persue the "Stanford experience"
theme. One is a delicate,
optimistic love poem, the other a
word-twisting and witty
examination of an identity crisis
which refuses to take itself
seriously.
Including several different
categories of artwork by
individuals interested in a variety
subjects (not all of them
connected with art of creative
writing), the Winter "Sequoia"
fulfills its objective without
sacrificing continuity. As an
overall theme, the concept of a
Stanford experience provides a
satisfying, yet subtle sense of
unity which had been lacking in
previous editions.
The Sequoia will be on sale
Wednesday through Friday on
White Plaza.
