Vietnamese Relocated
SAIGON — South Vietnamese and American officials
here have disclosed plans for what is expected to be
the largest movement of peasants in the history of
Vietnam.
The Saigon government, with full American
support, hopes to resettle some 5 00,0 0 0 refugees in
more sparsely populated provinces.
The peasants are to be moved to the two
southern-most military regions, called 111 Corps and
IV Corps.
It is an attempt by the South Vietnamese to solve
chronic refugee problems in the northernmost
military zone, called 1 Corps, where nearly a million
peasants, by official estimate, have been moved from
villages during the last four years to settle in slums
around urban centers, and to meet the
unemployment problem growing in the wake of the
withdrawal of American troops.
Some American officials here have expressed fear
that the movement will create more physical and
psychological stress than the peasants, already
bewildered by the war. can handle.
They add that the movement will add greatly to
post-war social reconstruction problems.
South Vietnamese officials believe the vast
movement will be acceptable to the refugees — who
have already broken ties with their ancestral plots, so
important as centers of Vietnamese religious worship.
Some Vietnamese, sharply critical of the
movement, say that the migration is a political move
by the government against the Vietnamese of the
northernmost provinces, who have consistently
resisted control by the Saigon government.

Officer Killed In ragging *
SAIGON — One United States major was killed and
another wounded Friday after an argument between
several black enlisted men and the two officers, both
white.
Yesterday, the U.S. command would say only that
one major had been killed and a second wounded.
But informed sources in the field confirmed that
the shooting was another in a growing number of
incidents of "fragging" in which enlisted men have
attacked their leaders because of hostilities caused by
racial problems, attitudes toward the Vietnam War,
and what seems to be an increasing antagonism
toward unpopular officers and sergeants as the war
winds down.
The Army said that the shooting had occurred at
the Quang Tri base camp of the First Brigade, Fifth
Infantry Division (mechanized). Quang Tri is South
Vietnam's northernmost province.
Details were withheld pending completion of an
investigation and the notification of victims' next of
kin.
Clay To Fight
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court granted a
hearing today to heavyweight fighter Muhammad Ali
on his claim that he was entitled to exemption from
the draft as a religious conscientious objector.
The court's action, announced in a brief order,
clears the way for Ali's fight in March with Joe
Frazier for the heavyweight boxing championship.
Ali, also known as Cassius Clay, was convicted 3

1 /2 years ago for refusing induction into the Army.
He claimed he was entitled to an exemption as a
Muslim minister.
His conviction carried a five-year sentence, and
boxing officials stripped him of the title he had won
from Sonny Liston.
*Daily CaV To Cut Ties
The Berkeley student newspaper hopes to move
off-campus and publish independently within two
years rather than face possible control by its
often-hostile administration and Board of Regents.
The Daily Californian staff last week announced
new editorial groundrules in response to demands by
the Regents for "acceptable guidelines for
publication." However, Daily Cal editor Bruce Koon
viewed the proposals as interim measures until the
paper becomes independent of current university
subsidies.
He doubted the planned guidelines would curb the
paper's editorial positions. "We did not come up with
guidelines that we can't work with" Koon said.
The Daily Cal along with the student papers at the
eight other University of California campuses has
been the target of attacks by some Regents for the
paper's strident political tone. In addition many
Regents were particularly upset with an allegedly
obscene picture in the UCLA paper last spring.
In July the Regents called for the new guidelines
to be presented at their Jan. 22 meeting.
According to Koon, the Daily Cal will suggest a
revived Publishing Board with a majority of students
which will meet with the paper's staff "to oversee the
paper's operation," according to Koon.

Vietnamese Relocated
SAIGON — South Vietnamese and American officials
here have disclosed plans for what is expected to be
the largest movement of peasants in the history of
Vietnam.
The Saigon government, with full American
support, hopes to resettle some 5 00,0 0 0 refugees in
more sparsely populated provinces.
The peasants are to be moved to the two
southern-most military regions, called 111 Corps and
IV Corps.
It is an attempt by the South Vietnamese to solve
chronic refugee problems in the northernmost
military zone, called 1 Corps, where nearly a million
peasants, by official estimate, have been moved from
villages during the last four years to settle in slums
around urban centers, and to meet the
unemployment problem growing in the wake of the
withdrawal of American troops.
Some American officials here have expressed fear
that the movement will create more physical and
psychological stress than the peasants, already
bewildered by the war. can handle.
They add that the movement will add greatly to
post-war social reconstruction problems.
South Vietnamese officials believe the vast
movement will be acceptable to the refugees — who
have already broken ties with their ancestral plots, so
important as centers of Vietnamese religious worship.
Some Vietnamese, sharply critical of the
movement, say that the migration is a political move
by the government against the Vietnamese of the
northernmost provinces, who have consistently
resisted control by the Saigon government.

Officer Killed In ragging *
SAIGON — One United States major was killed and
another wounded Friday after an argument between
several black enlisted men and the two officers, both
white.
Yesterday, the U.S. command would say only that
one major had been killed and a second wounded.
But informed sources in the field confirmed that
the shooting was another in a growing number of
incidents of "fragging" in which enlisted men have
attacked their leaders because of hostilities caused by
racial problems, attitudes toward the Vietnam War,
and what seems to be an increasing antagonism
toward unpopular officers and sergeants as the war
winds down.
The Army said that the shooting had occurred at
the Quang Tri base camp of the First Brigade, Fifth
Infantry Division (mechanized). Quang Tri is South
Vietnam's northernmost province.
Details were withheld pending completion of an
investigation and the notification of victims' next of
kin.
Clay To Fight
WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court granted a
hearing today to heavyweight fighter Muhammad Ali
on his claim that he was entitled to exemption from
the draft as a religious conscientious objector.
The court's action, announced in a brief order,
clears the way for Ali's fight in March with Joe
Frazier for the heavyweight boxing championship.
Ali, also known as Cassius Clay, was convicted 3

1 /2 years ago for refusing induction into the Army.
He claimed he was entitled to an exemption as a
Muslim minister.
His conviction carried a five-year sentence, and
boxing officials stripped him of the title he had won
from Sonny Liston.
*Daily CaV To Cut Ties
The Berkeley student newspaper hopes to move
off-campus and publish independently within two
years rather than face possible control by its
often-hostile administration and Board of Regents.
The Daily Californian staff last week announced
new editorial groundrules in response to demands by
the Regents for "acceptable guidelines for
publication." However, Daily Cal editor Bruce Koon
viewed the proposals as interim measures until the
paper becomes independent of current university
subsidies.
He doubted the planned guidelines would curb the
paper's editorial positions. "We did not come up with
guidelines that we can't work with" Koon said.
The Daily Cal along with the student papers at the
eight other University of California campuses has
been the target of attacks by some Regents for the
paper's strident political tone. In addition many
Regents were particularly upset with an allegedly
obscene picture in the UCLA paper last spring.
