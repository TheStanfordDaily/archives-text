# Sleep Research Helps Cure Insomniacs
## 
### 
Knowledge gained from nearly two
decades of sleep research is now being
applied by physicians to the treatment
of insomniacs and other patients with
sleep disturbances.
A Sleep Disorders Clinic, opened
recently at the University Medical
Center, offers diagnosis and treatment
of insomnia, narcolepsy,
hyper insomnia, bed wetting,
nightmares, sleep walking, and other
afflictions involving the nighttime
portion of man's existence.
The new clinic, one of three in the
country, is directed by Dr. William C.
Dement, a neurophysiologist and
leading sleep researcher. Dr. Dement
entered the field of sleep research in
the early fifties. At that time, the
subject was essentially a scientific
curiosity pursued by a handful of
persistent, sleepy-eyed young men who

stayed awake at night to observe others
sleep, and to study their brain wave
recordings on miles of polygraph paper.
"This research, which has been done
with generous federal support, has been
well worth it," said Dr. Dement in a
recent interview.
One important early observation
made by Dr. Dement and his colleagues
is that dreaming in humans and animals
occurs mostly during a stage of sleep
which appears in humans with
monotonous regularity every 90
minutes throughout the night. During
these dreaming periods, the sleeper
shifts his eyes as if to scan the
unfolding panorama of his dream
world.
This nocturnal phenomenon, called
rapid eye movement or REM sleep, is
believed to be essential to well being.
Past studies by Dr. Dement have shown

that depriving a person of REM sleep
can cause sleep abnormalities and
mental changes.
Sleep disorders constitute a health
problem of some consequence in the
United States, Dr. Dement stated. A
few years ago it was estimated that
Americans were spending in excess of
$100 million a year for sleep-inducing
prescription drugs. The figure has
undoubtedly gone up since then, and it
does not include over-the-counter
preparations.
The problem is further complicated
by the fact that the science of sleep
research is relatively new, any many
practicing physicians are not well
informed on the subject. As a result,
Dr. Dement said, some sleep disorders
encountered by doctors are often
misdiagnosed and mistreated. Sleep
Disorders Clinic, Dr. William C.
Dement.
The story of several young mothers
who had experienced postpartum
insomnia was cited as a case in point.
"A normal condition for many mothers
after childbirth, such insomnia is
probably nature's way of making sure
the mother hears the baby at night,"
said Dr. Dement.
However, these patients were treated
with barbituates prescribed by their
physicians, he related. Soon the
mothers developed drug tolerance and
the dose was gradually increased. When
they came to the sleep clinic, the
patients were hooked on barbituates

and complained of acute insomnia. At
the clinic, the patients were simply
placed on a program of gradual drug
withdrawal. After that they slept
normally.
The case of the young mothers is of
more than passing clinical interest
because sleep researchers now know
that some sleeping drugs suppress REM
sleep while others do not, and the
dependency on sleeping pills occurs
most readily in the REM-suppressive
compounds.
"This is why insomniacs who are
given drugs for prolonged periods
should be given one of those drugs
which produce normal sleep rather than
medications which suppress or
eliminate the REM phase," Dr. Dement
explained.
When patients are referred to the
clinic, they are interviewed by Dr.
Dement and his staff to determine if
their sleep problems are related to
mental or physical illness.
Patients admitted to the clinic may
come in the evening to sleep in the
laboratory. To study their patterns of
sleep of lack of it, the sleep researchers
tape tine discs to each patient's hea.d
that are attached to an
electroencephalograph. Tracings on
miles of graph paper record brain
waves, eye movements, as well as body
temperature and heart rate. When drugs
are prescribed to improve the patient's
sleep, precautions are taken to insure
that drug effects are specified.
