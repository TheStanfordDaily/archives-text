The Santa Clara County Health Department urges all persons
vacationing at or near the hotel "Hacienda de Lobos" at Puerty Vallarta
from December 15 to January 2 and who were exposed to a "Coati
Mundi" to visit their local health center and be treated for rabies. The
animal in question died January 2 and was proven rabid.
At least two Stanford male students, one named "Jaime", who were
sleeping on the beach near the hotel came into considerable contact with
the animal. They should contact Cowell Health Center.
