# Firebombs Hit Hewlett Home
## 
### 
The Palo Alto home of
multi-millionaire William Hewlett,
president of Hewlett-Packard
Corporation, was firebombed early
yesterday morning. Hewlett and his
wife Flora were asleep upstairs when
the two Molotov cocktail-type bombs
smashed against the house at about
12:30 a.m. Police said that Hewlett
awoke and doused flames with a fire
extinguisher before firemen or police
arrived.
A neighbor, who was not identified,
witnessed the attack and called the
police. She said she was awakened by
the sound of a car in the street with its
engine running. When she heard the
muffled sound of two explosions, she
went to a window where she observed
two white men run to a black
Volkswagon and leave.
Soft Drink Bombs
The bombs caused minor damage to
the exterior of the residence at 537
Coleridge Ave. One hit the house about
12 feet above the ground, near the
bedroom window. The other exploded
about seven feet up on the front porch.
Police Lt. A 1 Bowra said the
firebombs were made of soft drink
bottles with a rag "fuse" used to ignite
the combustible substance inside.
Kerosene may have been used, but
Bowra said that a small sample of it
found in a portion of one of the bottles
would have to be checked at a
criminology lab for identification.

Hewlett, 56, is president and chief
executive officer of Hewlett-Packard,
the $30 0 million electronics and
instrumentation firm that grew from a
1 939 partnership with his Stanford
University classmate, David Packard,
now assistant secretary of defense.
Hewlett is also a director of Chase
Manhattan Corp., Chrysler Corp., FCM
Corp, the Overseas Development
Council, and the Rand Corp. Both
Hewlett and Packard are ranked by
Fortune Magazine as among the 4 0
richest men in the nation.
Hewlett is also a trustee of Stanford,
and he and his wife have lived at the
Palo Alto address for a number of
years. They had just returned Sunday

night after a weekend out of town
when the bombing occurred.
Death Threat
The attack was the first overt act
against Hewlett although he has
received earlier telephone threats.
Within a week during the Encina Hall
sit-in of May 1 969 he received two
telephoned death threats. One of the
anonymous callers declared, "You are a
dead man."
Hewlett-Packard Corp. is a leading
manufacturer of electronic, medical
and analytical instruments and small
computers, with less than 10 percent of
its business relating to defense work,
according to company spokesman
David Kir by.
