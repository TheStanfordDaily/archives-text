# Troubled Fraternities May Go Back To Row
## 
### 
Two fraternities facing financial
difficulties will move from the
fraternity clusters near Cowell Health
Center to the former fraternity row,
according to assistant Dean of Students
John Grube. The move will lake place
next Fall, provided the fraternities, Chi
Psi and Deke, have a sufficient number
of pledges this Spring.
The action has caused concern
among current residents who will lose
their houses on the Row. Grube said
yesterday that the Dean of Students
would "try to relocate students with
the least amount of inconvenience
possible," but the displaced students
would not' be able to take another
house to replace their former residences
on the row.
Both fraternities are in financial
difficulty, unable to maintain a
membership quota of forty-five which
is needed to pay the rent on their
houses. If they were moved onto the
row, they feel they could survive
economically as a much smaller group.
Chi Psi member Gary Clark '72 feels
that the "cookie cutter" architecture
and distance from the center of campus
handicapped the popularity of his
fraternity. If Chi Psi were to move to
the Row "things would be 4 4 per cent
better."
Bolstering Fraternities
However, the current living groups
on the Row are adamently against the
change, generally feeling that the
University is sacrificing their living
groups to bolster fraternities which
should be able to survive on their own.
Members of four all-female houses,
two of which may be used for the
fraternities and are especially alarmed
by the University decision to displace
two houses. They cherish house

traditions which they say would be
destroyed and resent what they term an
arbitrary ruling.
According to Karen Bjorkland, RA
at Storey House moving fraternities
into Storey or Lathrop, would
effectively eliminate the all-girl housing
option. "They will be unable to fill the
former fraternity houses because girls
would rather move off campus than live
in the sterile, traditionless cluster
houses away from the center of
campus; therefore the University will
have no other choice but to make the
clusters into co-ed living units."
Sense of Tradition
There are currently nine Row
Houses: Grove House is the center of
an experiment in group living and
several creative seminars: Jordan
Co-op members are responsible for the
maintenance and administration of
their house; Durand, recently turned
co-ed, provides a center for transfer
students, and, according to sophomore
Dorthy McNoble, "provides a realistic
living situation." Mayfield is an
all-men's residence.
The remaining four, Roth, Guthrie,
Lathrop, and Storey, are the only
all-women residence units on the
campus. Even Florence Moore, which
until last year was all-female, offers
co-ed living in two of its houses.
Although the acceptance of new
residents is strictly determined by the
housing office, the four houses are
financially independent units enjoying
a sense of tradition.
They have been consistantly popular
in the housing draws and, according to
the Lathrop Resident Assistant, a
significantly high percentage of the girls
return to their house each year,
considering it to be their "campus
home."
