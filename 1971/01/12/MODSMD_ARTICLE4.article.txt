# One, Two, Many Identities
## Students State Personal Views Of Racism 
### EVE KAUFMAN 
Racism.
An ambiguous term to many but something
minority students here must confront and something
that many white students feel they don't really
understand.
While some students view racism as an assault
against individual pride, others identify it as a denial
of citizenship or economic rights. Many views of
racism and what it means are expressed in interviews
with minority students here.
Corrine Garza, an American Indian, resents being
over-identified with a specific groupâ€”especially when
students refer to her as "chief," "Pochahantas," or
"squaw," and question her about life in an igloo or
tepee. She has found difficulty establishing a personal
identity because of these incidents.
This stereotyping which, according to Charles
Harris, a black, usually involves characteristics
thought of as derogatory, affects the manner in which
members of a minority group regard themselves.
Quaintly Different
Members of minority groups are often looked upon
as being quaintly different; their problems are
overlooked causing resentment. Gene Tom, chairman
of the Asian-American Student Alliance ((AASA)
said, "When people visit Chinatown in San Francisco
they make trite but complimentary comments
concerning the 'interesting food,' or some other
aspect of tourism; they ignore the fact that the area is
a ghetto characterized by suffering, hatred, and
fru station."
Lorenzo Stars, an American Indian, echoes this
feeling when explaining the Indian students'
objection to the traditional INdian trademark of
Stanford. He would prefer that people remember the
poverty and difficulty living conditions of Indians on
reservations rather than the mascot of Stanford.
Tom defines racism as: "the sum total of overt and
covert practices utilized by the white majority
population to suppress the rights of ethnic minorities

to be called legitimately American." He feels that in
attempting to earn the psychological citizenship
demanded by the majority of Americans his parents:
generation achieved material success but left their
offspring without a sense of racial pride.
Tom blames the mass media for stereotyping
oriental women as "exotic, submissive slaves'" and
their husbands as "quiet, timid, and unaggressive
men."
Swallowing Pride
"Asian-Americans were forced into situations
where the only way they could survive was by
swallowing their outward pride and convincing the
society that they did not represent a threat to the
position of the white man."
Racism can also become a way of maintaining
social position according to white and minority
students. Paul Volpp, a white, feels: "Everybody,
when thinking logically, agrees that people should
have equal rights, but they are afraid of losing their
jobs or their social position."
Kerr, it Lucas, a black, continues this theme.
"People convince themselves that a person is less
human because of his race, and therefore worthy of a
menial job," he says. After a while, he adds, "Those
who are being exploited begin to believe they're
inferior."
Opposition of some blacks to school integration by
school bussing is pointed to by some whites as an
example of reverse racism. But Kennard and Lucas
deny that this exists and Lucas views this charge as a
"game" used by people to justify their own racism by
identifying similar feelings in others. Loving your
own race more than another is not racism, he
concluded.
Harris and Stars feel that they have not met with
any personal racial incidents here. However, Manuel
Dias, a Chicano, says. "People at Stanford are too
sophisticated to show outward prejudice, but I am
defensive because of my past experiences with
prejudice in society."

A spokesman for the BSU, feels that the University
is a racist institution since it reflects and perpetuates
the American society that exists on a basis of
prejudice.
Not All Racists
lie added, however, that every student graduating
from the University does not have racist intentions.
The institutional racism instead implies that there is
no place in the present society for someone who is
not a racist.
L)ias feels that education is the only possibility for
equality, because 'economically minorities can't mix.
However, he feels that the education which presents
only one viewpoint helps perpetuate ignorance. He
hopefully envisions a system of multi-lingual
instruction.
Stars noted that history books emphasize only the
war-like nature of American Indians, but never give
details of their cultural heritage. For example, the
governing body set up by the Iroquoios Confederacy
was a democratic organization which preceeded
democracy in the United States.
Personal recognition of the prejudice each person
holds will improve the racial situation, many feel.
But, Gail Kennard added that there is no possible way
for white people to fully understand the problems of
ethnic minorities, and the sooner that is accepted, the
easier communication will be.
Liberal Guilt
"There is a tremendous amount of guilt that comes
out very strongly in white liberals, and Black people
never know how far the whites will go in protecting
them," she said.
Kennard feels that white students can best counter
racism bv working in the white community to
promote understanding among parents and friends,
rather than by working in the black community with
21 patronizing attitude.
All the students agree that change is necessary,
whether accomplished by upgrading and diversifying
educational opportunities, establishing firm racial
pride or by organizing economic boycotts.
