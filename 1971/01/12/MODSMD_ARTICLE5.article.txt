Because we don t publish on Saturday we neglected to wish
Dick Nixon, our President and the future father-in-law of ASSU
President Patrick Carswell Shea, a happy 58th birthday. It's
probable that we would have neglected it anyway.
Needless to say, we're having our staff luncheon at noon today:
all nominations for editor are due then. If you can't make it to
lunch, call our news office at 321-2300 x 4632. Those of you who
wish to advertise may call our business office at 327-4150.
