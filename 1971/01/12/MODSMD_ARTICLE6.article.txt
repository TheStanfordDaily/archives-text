## Lodge, Speech, And Power 
### 
Leonard siegal

Yesterday , demonstrators
sought to show that war-criminals
like Henry Cabot Lodge have no
right to walk the streets and
campuses of America. By

preventing Lodge from speaking,
they were not protesting Lodge's
speech; they were protesting his
power -concrete acts of policy
formation and implementation in
Southeast Asia. Perhaps letting
Lodge begin his speech or
throwing rotten tomatoes would
have been better tactics, but I
sense that anything short of tacit
attention would have upset the
normally apathetic Stanford
community.
Those who wished to engage
Lodge in dialogue about the War
during the question period should
notice that Lodge refused to
answer questions about the War at
his morning press conference and
planned to do the same at his
afternoon speech.
Lodge came to Stanford
wearing the mask of the
"statesman." As a star of the U.S.
diplomatic corps for two decades.
Lodge finds this disguise
comfortable. However, like Bob
Dylan in "Masters of War," many
see through Lodge's mask. Lodge
is one of the men most
responsible for the War in
Southeast Asia, and is culpable for
the massive killing, cultural
genocide, and physical
destruction. He deserves to be
prosecuted and jailed for his
crimes.
In fact, one can reasonably argue
that Lodge should have been
placed under citizen's arrest rather
than heckled, but outside of
Uruguay this is still not too
practical. If Lodge came to

Stanford as a defendant in a war
crimes tribunal, rather than as a
respected "world leader," then he
could have been able to defend his
position with out interruption.
Free speech is a concept to
which most Americans, regardless
of political persuasion, give lip
service. Its value is guaranteeing
access to all ideas, no matter how
unpopular. Yesterday's
demonstration, in this sense, did
not hinder Lodge's free speech.
I too would have been
disturbed, if everyone present
yesterday did not have easy access
to Lodge's ideas and statements.
Pro-war (anti-total-withdrawal)
speakers are not uniformly driven
from the campus, and they still
dominate the mass media.
Yesterday in Dinkelspiel a
student asked whether the radicals
were afraid to let people listen to
Lodge. The answer, emphatically,
is "No!" I encourage everyone to
study Lodge's speeches, writings,
and actions throughout his career.
Get a copy of his prepared text
for yesterday, in which he
compares Communist
"aggression" in Vietnam to Hitler.
So-called liberals like Lodge run
this country, and it is our duty to
figure out what they are up to.
If reaction to the anti-Lodge
demonstration resembles the
response to previous
demonstrations, a large number of
students and faculty will be
distrubed by its impolite manner.
The government imposes much
more stringent restrictions on

human liberty, but the veneer of
law and propriety conceals its true
nature. Bobby Scale, Angela
Davis, and Eldridge Cleaver can no
longer speak on college campuses,
though their charges, even if
proven, do not compare to the
crimes of men like Lodge. Ernest
Mandel, Marxist Economist, could
not speak at Stanford last year
because the State Department
would not let him enter the
country. Even the Marlon
Brando flick, Burn (an allegory to
Vietnam) faces suppression, as the
movie industry refuses to
advertise its existence. The
Movement does not have the
resources of ruling class that it
opposes. Consequently its actions
are not always "by the rules."
Three years ago administration
spokesmen were driven off college
campuses across the country. But
active opposition has subsided,
unfortunately across the coui 'ry.
Consequently, the killing has
intensified.
