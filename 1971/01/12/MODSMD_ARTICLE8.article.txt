oink, oink
"Oink, oink and Fascist Pig"
was all you could hear as a small
band of determined
demonstrators disrupted Henry
Cabot Lodge's talk yesterday at
Dinkelspiel.
Both Glenn Campbell, director
of the Hoover Institute, and
Berkeley Tompkins tried valiantly
to introduce Ambassador Lodge.
"It is always nice to be
associated with such a police
audience," said Tompkins. His
sarcasm was wasted because after
pausing somewhat nervously in
front of the lectern, Lodge gave
up.
Before Campbell closed the
meeting, a student from the
audience of 85 0 asked, "Are you
afraid to hear what he has to
say?"
Despite the wild burst of
enthusiastic clapping that greeted
this question, the meeting was
cancelled.
During the seven years I have
spent at this university, I have
never been as angry or as
humiliated. Since when does a
small band of students have the
right to employ totalitarian fascist
behavior. If they did not want to
attend, they could have walked
out.
And why did the university
handle the situation so ineptly? If
students had not been clogging
the aisles in violation of fire safety
ordinances, it would have been
quite possible to have removed
those nauseating scum who
succeeded in adding another
smear to Stanford's reputation as
an enlightened campus.

apology
The following letter has been
sent to Henry Cabot Lodge
The prevention of your speech
by disrupters at Stanford was
deplorable and inexcusable. On
behalf of the student body we
apologize.
No one should be allowed to
deny a speaker his right of free
speech. Any student or faculty
member who participated in the
disruption of your speech should
be brought before the appropriate
body for disciplinary action.

people's victory
Dear Editor:
Yesterday's cancellation of
Ambassador H.C. Lodge's speech
was a people's victory. We hope
that he could appreciate the fact
that he still has his life, his
money, and his power. (After all,
for many of us, the slogan is,
"Death to the fascist pigs!") We
also hope that he could appreciate
the similarity between his respect
for the rights of the Vietnamese
people at My Lai, his respect for
China's freedom of speech in the
United Nations, and the welcome
we gave him.
Henry Cabot Lodge was
Ambassador to South Vietnam
during the period when U.S.
policy in Southeast Asia was
formulated. That policy has
resulted in the killing of well

over a million Vietnamese people
and the destruction of vast areas of
Indochina by defoliation and na
palm. Yet he flashed us his corpor
ate liberal smile and said that he is
not a dangerous man!
If the audience in Dinkelspiel
had remained silent while he
spoke, we would have been
showing our support for the
policy which he engineered in
Southeast Asia. And the Nixon
administration would have taken
that silence as support for its
present policy of resuming the
bombing of North Vietnam and
escalating the war while
pretending to withdraw.
For once Lodge had to face the
wrath of the people in support of
the Vietnamese struggle. Right
on! Vietnamese people who have
met Americans in Cuba on the
Venceremos Brigade and Duan
Van Taoi, the Vietnamese student
who spoke at Stanford last week,
have told us how crucial American
resistance to the war is to their
struggle. They would also have
seen silence as support for Nixon's
policies. We were not silent, and
we will not be silent in the future.
It is clear to us that there are
only two sides to this struggle,
and people must choose sides
now. There is no middle ground.
We have chosen the side of the
Vietnamese people, and we will
defend them by any means
necessary.

a sad day
Fditor, THE DAILY:
"This is a sad day in the history
of Stanford University," said W.

Glenn Campbell, as jeering
students shouted him down from
the platform with catcalls aimed
squarely at their target: Henry
Cabot Lodge.
Campbell was right.
It is a "sad day" in the life of a
university when an invited guest
such as Lodge (or indeed when
any man) is forcibly silenced by
an angry few, and even more sad,
when by an angry many.
Yet these same students, if
silenced in a similarly intimidating
way, would scream "Oppression!"
at the top of their lungs. And
justifiably so.
Is Henry Cabot Lodge a war
criminal? Is he heavily and
personally responsible for the
needless and savage deaths of
thousands of innocent people?
Obviously, many of those
oinkingat Dinkelspial thought so.
These vociferous people prevented
Lodge from speaking, thereby
accomplishing their goal. And yet
they missed three great
opportunities.
They missed the opportunity to
expose, to examine, and perhaps
even to communicate with Lodge
through dialogue and
confrontation.
They missed the opportunity to
get through to those members of
the audience who were
uncommitted in ideology, or
conversely committed to the war
effort.
What the hecklers did not fail
to do was to interfere with many
peoples' rights of free speech and
assembly and to bolster those
forces in America crying out for
"law and order."

Campbell was right.
It is a "sad day" in the life of a
university when an invited guest
such as Lodge (or indeed when
any man) is forcibly silenced by
an angry few, and even more sad,
when by an angry many.
Yet these same students, if
silenced in a similarly intimidating
way, would scream "Oppression!"
at the top of their lungs. And
justifiably so.
Is Henry Cabot Lodge a war
criminal? Is he heavily and
personally responsible for the
needless and savage deaths of
thousands of innocent people?
Obviously, many of those
oinkingat Dinkelspial thought so.
These vociferous people prevented
Lodge from speaking, thereby
accomplishing their goal. And yet
they missed three great
opportunities.
They missed the opportunity to
expose, to examine, and perhaps
even to communicate with Lodge
through dialogue and
confrontation.
They missed the opportunity to
get through to those members of
the audience who were
uncommitted in ideology, or
conversely committed to the war
effort.
What the hecklers did not fail
to do was to interfere with many
peoples' rights of free speech and
assembly and to bolster those
forces in America crying out for
"law and order."
A Student for Peace
oink, oink
"Oink, oink and Fascist Pig"
was all you could hear as a small
band of determined
demonstrators disrupted Henry
Cabot Lodge's talk yesterday at
Dinkelspiel.
Both Glenn Campbell, director
of the Hoover Institute, and
Berkeley Tompkins tried valiantly
to introduce Ambassador Lodge.
"It is always nice to be
associated with such a police
audience," said Tompkins. His
sarcasm was wasted because after
pausing somewhat nervously in
front of the lectern, Lodge gave
up.
Before Campbell closed the
meeting, a student from the
audience of 85 0 asked, "Are you
afraid to hear what he has to
say?"
Despite the wild burst of
enthusiastic clapping that greeted
this question, the meeting was
cancelled.
During the seven years I have
spent at this university, I have
never been as angry or as
humiliated. Since when does a
small band of students have the
right to employ totalitarian fascist
behavior. If they did not want to
attend, they could have walked
out.
And why did the university
handle the situation so ineptly? If
students had not been clogging
the aisles in violation of fire safety
ordinances, it would have been
quite possible to have removed
those nauseating scum who
succeeded in adding another
smear to Stanford's reputation as
an enlightened campus.

people's victory
Dear Editor:
Yesterday's cancellation of
Ambassador H.C. Lodge's speech
was a people's victory. We hope
that he could appreciate the fact
that he still has his life, his
money, and his power. (After all,
for many of us, the slogan is,
"Death to the fascist pigs!") We
also hope that he could appreciate
the similarity between his respect
for the rights of the Vietnamese
people at My Lai, his respect for
China's freedom of speech in the
United Nations, and the welcome
we gave him.
Henry Cabot Lodge was
Ambassador to South Vietnam
during the period when U.S.
policy in Southeast Asia was
formulated. That policy has
resulted in the killing of well

over a million Vietnamese people
and the destruction of vast areas of
Indochina by defoliation and na
palm. Yet he flashed us his corpor
ate liberal smile and said that he is
not a dangerous man!
If the audience in Dinkelspiel
had remained silent while he
spoke, we would have been
showing our support for the
policy which he engineered in
Southeast Asia. And the Nixon
administration would have taken
that silence as support for its
present policy of resuming the
bombing of North Vietnam and
escalating the war while
pretending to withdraw.
For once Lodge had to face the
wrath of the people in support of
the Vietnamese struggle. Right
on! Vietnamese people who have
met Americans in Cuba on the
Venceremos Brigade and Duan
Van Taoi, the Vietnamese student
who spoke at Stanford last week,
have told us how crucial American
resistance to the war is to their
struggle. They would also have
seen silence as support for Nixon's
policies. We were not silent, and
we will not be silent in the future.
It is clear to us that there are
only two sides to this struggle,
and people must choose sides
now. There is no middle ground.
We have chosen the side of the
Vietnamese people, and we will
defend them by any means
necessary.

administration would have taken
that silence as support for its
present policy of resuming the
bombing of North Vietnam and
escalating the war while
pretending to withdraw.
For once Lodge had to face the
wrath of the people in support of
the Vietnamese struggle. Right
on! Vietnamese people who have
met Americans in Cuba on the
Venceremos Brigade and Duan
Van Taoi, the Vietnamese student
who spoke at Stanford last week,
have told us how crucial American
resistance to the war is to their
struggle. They would also have
seen silence as support for Nixon's
policies. We were not silent, and
we will not be silent in the future.
It is clear to us that there are
only two sides to this struggle,
and people must choose sides
now. There is no middle ground.
We have chosen the side of the
Vietnamese people, and we will
defend them by any means
necessary.

a sad day
Fditor, THE DAILY:
"This is a sad day in the history
of Stanford University," said W.

Glenn Campbell, as jeering
students shouted him down from
the platform with catcalls aimed
squarely at their target: Henry
Cabot Lodge.
Campbell was right.
It is a "sad day" in the life of a
university when an invited guest
such as Lodge (or indeed when
any man) is forcibly silenced by
an angry few, and even more sad,
when by an angry many.
Yet these same students, if
silenced in a similarly intimidating
way, would scream "Oppression!"
at the top of their lungs. And
justifiably so.
Is Henry Cabot Lodge a war
criminal? Is he heavily and
personally responsible for the
needless and savage deaths of
thousands of innocent people?
Obviously, many of those
oinkingat Dinkelspial thought so.
These vociferous people prevented
Lodge from speaking, thereby
accomplishing their goal. And yet
they missed three great
opportunities.
They missed the opportunity to
expose, to examine, and perhaps
even to communicate with Lodge
through dialogue and
confrontation.
They missed the opportunity to
get through to those members of
the audience who were
uncommitted in ideology, or
conversely committed to the war
effort.
What the hecklers did not fail
to do was to interfere with many
peoples' rights of free speech and
assembly and to bolster those
forces in America crying out for
"law and order."
A Student for Peace
oink, oink
"Oink, oink and Fascist Pig"
was all you could hear as a small
band of determined
demonstrators disrupted Henry
Cabot Lodge's talk yesterday at
Dinkelspiel.
Both Glenn Campbell, director
of the Hoover Institute, and
Berkeley Tompkins tried valiantly
to introduce Ambassador Lodge.
"It is always nice to be
associated with such a police
audience," said Tompkins. His
sarcasm was wasted because after
pausing somewhat nervously in
front of the lectern, Lodge gave
up.
Before Campbell closed the
meeting, a student from the
audience of 85 0 asked, "Are you
afraid to hear what he has to
say?"
Despite the wild burst of
enthusiastic clapping that greeted
this question, the meeting was
cancelled.
During the seven years I have
spent at this university, I have
never been as angry or as
humiliated. Since when does a
small band of students have the
right to employ totalitarian fascist
behavior. If they did not want to
attend, they could have walked
out.
And why did the university
handle the situation so ineptly? If
students had not been clogging
the aisles in violation of fire safety
ordinances, it would have been
quite possible to have removed
those nauseating scum who
succeeded in adding another
smear to Stanford's reputation as
an enlightened campus.

apology
The following letter has been
sent to Henry Cabot Lodge
The prevention of your speech
by disrupters at Stanford was
deplorable and inexcusable. On
behalf of the student body we
apologize.
No one should be allowed to
deny a speaker his right of free
speech. Any student or faculty
member who participated in the
disruption of your speech should
be brought before the appropriate
body for disciplinary action.

people's victory
Dear Editor:
Yesterday's cancellation of
Ambassador H.C. Lodge's speech
was a people's victory. We hope
that he could appreciate the fact
that he still has his life, his
money, and his power. (After all,
for many of us, the slogan is,
"Death to the fascist pigs!") We
also hope that he could appreciate
the similarity between his respect
for the rights of the Vietnamese
people at My Lai, his respect for
China's freedom of speech in the
United Nations, and the welcome
we gave him.
Henry Cabot Lodge was
Ambassador to South Vietnam
during the period when U.S.
policy in Southeast Asia was
formulated. That policy has
resulted in the killing of well

over a million Vietnamese people
and the destruction of vast areas of
Indochina by defoliation and na
palm. Yet he flashed us his corpor
ate liberal smile and said that he is
not a dangerous man!
If the audience in Dinkelspiel
had remained silent while he
spoke, we would have been
showing our support for the
policy which he engineered in
Southeast Asia. And the Nixon
administration would have taken
that silence as support for its
present policy of resuming the
bombing of North Vietnam and
escalating the war while
pretending to withdraw.
For once Lodge had to face the
