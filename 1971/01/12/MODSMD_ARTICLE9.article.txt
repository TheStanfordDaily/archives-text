# Speechless?
## 
### 
The novelist Leo Tolstoy was once asked
if he saw a difference between reactionary
repression and revolutionary repression. His
response - "yes, the difference between
catshit and dogshit."
There can be no sane defense for the
denial of civil rights - in particular the right
of free expression. This is especially true on
a University campus which is set up as a
haven of free expression for all viewpoints.
In view of this, the disruption yesterday
which halted the address of Henry Cabot
Lodge was intolerable, and posed a serious
threat to what has traditionally been called
"academic freedom"
Some of the revolutionary hecklers who
interrupted Lodge's speech have defended
their actions on the following grounds:
-Lodge is a pig, and in his role as a
high-ranking diplomat has been a direct
accomplice in the murder of thousands of
Vietnamese, - "a real war criminal."
â€” Actions stopping Lodge and men like
him from speaking at home lend real
support to the oppressed people's of the
third world.

Freedom of speech in this country is
an illusion in any case, when such
dissidents as Huey P. Newton and Diarmuid
McGuire are arrested for expressing their
political philosophies.
- The disruption that occurred was the
very least that could, and should, have been
done. In light of what Lodge represents,
people ought to be grateful that stronger
action wasn't taken.
The above arguments lead to the
conclusion that the concept of freedom of
speech should be considered secondary to
the questions of who the speaker is and
what he stands for - if, indeed, it is to be
considered at all.
The freedom to openly express opinions
on a University campus must be
maintained, no matter who the speaker
may be. When this tenet is overthrown, the
University, as a forum for the exchange of
ideas, can no longer exist.
If "little, insignificant" rights, such as
freedom of speech, are moved down in the
quest of greater Right and Justice, it won't
be long before there will be no rights or
freedoms at all.
