# Provost, Law Dean Named
## Research VP Designated For Academic Position 
### FRED MANN 
William F. Miller, University vice
president for research, has been named
provost, filling the post left vacant by
President Lyman's promotion to the
presidency last September 2 4 .
Lyman's selection of Miller was
approved by the Board of Trustees
yesterday. The provost is now the dean
of the faculty, the second ranking
adacemic officer of the University. He
serves as acting president when Lyman
is out of town, and usually deals with
curriculum and budgetary matters. He
now becomes the post as vice preadent for
academic affairs.
Miller was chosen out of a group of
seven nominees recommended by a
faculty-student consultative committee.
The committee, chaired by Alberta
Siegel, a psychologist in the Medical
School, submitted the names in two
groups: four unranked first choice
candidates and three secondary choices.
Miller was one of the top four.
"I am very pleased that Bill Miller is
willing to serve as provost," Lyman
said. "We have had a very satisfactory
working relationship thus far, and I
know we will continue to work well
together in his new position (sic).
"No one is perfect, but Mr. Miller is
very good. He is a man of varied
talents, phenomenal energy, and the
sort of patient persistence in the face of
difficulty that university administration
requires these days."
Miller is currently in Chile attending

a conference of the National Academy
of Sciences.
Here For 6 Years
He came to the University as a
professor of computer science in 1 965 ,
and was appointed head of the
computation group at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center the same
year. He also served as associate provost
for computing before being named to
the newly-created post of vice president
for research last year.
In this position Miller initiated a
survey of the faculty on research
possibilities and uncovered common
areas of interest useful in developing
research programs in such areas as
community development, and
population and environmental controls.
Margie Wolf, former editor of the
Daily and one of three students on the
10-member consultative committee said
the group was more impressed with
Miller the more they found out about
him.
"He is excellent with financial
matters and is very interested in
problem oriented inter-disciplinary
work," she said. "He seems to go out of
his way to meet students and talk with
them."
'Well Qualified'
Professor Siegel called Miller
"exceptionally well qualified," and said
he is "well regarded for his scholarly
contributions, his teaching, and his
excellent judgment on academic
questions."
J. Victor Baldridge, professor of
education and member of the selection
committee, remarked that Miller's
outstanding service as research vice
president and his close working
association with Lyman contributed to
his receiving recommendation from the
group. "W p were looking for two things
in a candidate," he said, "real
administrative ability and outstanding
scholarship. And Miller has both."
Another committee member, and
colleague of Miller, George Forsythe,
professor of computer science said, "He
(Miller) is extraordinarily strong in
knowing how organizations can be
made to work for people. He is a very
hard working individual who listens
well to students."
Lyman describes his new provost as a
quiet man dedicated to his job. "He

community development, and

Margie Wolf, former editor of the
Daily and one of three students on the
10-member consultative committee said
the group was more impressed with
Miller the more they found out about
him.
"He is excellent with financial
matters and is very interested in
problem oriented inter-disciplinary
work," she said. "He seems to go out of
his way to meet students and talk with
them."
'Well Qualified'
Professor Siegel called Miller
"exceptionally well qualified," and said
he is "well regarded for his scholarly
contributions, his teaching, and his
excellent judgment on academic
questions."
J. Victor Baldridge, professor of
education and member of the selection
committee, remarked that Miller's
outstanding service as research vice
president and his close working
association with Lyman contributed to
his receiving recommendation from the
group. "W p were looking for two things
in a candidate," he said, "real
administrative ability and outstanding
scholarship. And Miller has both."
Another committee member, and
colleague of Miller, George Forsythe,
professor of computer science said, "He
(Miller) is extraordinarily strong in
knowing how organizations can be
made to work for people. He is a very
hard working individual who listens
well to students."

William F. Miller, University vice
president for research, has been named
provost, filling the post left vacant by
President Lyman's promotion to the
presidency last September 2 4 .
Lyman's selection of Miller was
approved by the Board of Trustees
yesterday. The provost is now the dean
of the faculty, the second ranking
adacemic officer of the University. He
serves as acting president when Lyman
is out of town, and usually deals with
curriculum and budgetary matters. He
now becomes the post as vice preadent for
academic affairs.
Miller was chosen out of a group of
seven nominees recommended by a
faculty-student consultative committee.
The committee, chaired by Alberta
Siegel, a psychologist in the Medical
School, submitted the names in two
groups: four unranked first choice
candidates and three secondary choices.
Miller was one of the top four.
"I am very pleased that Bill Miller is
willing to serve as provost," Lyman
said. "We have had a very satisfactory
working relationship thus far, and I
know we will continue to work well
together in his new position (sic).
"No one is perfect, but Mr. Miller is
very good. He is a man of varied
talents, phenomenal energy, and the
sort of patient persistence in the face of
difficulty that university administration
requires these days."
Miller is currently in Chile attending

a conference of the National Academy
of Sciences.

William F. Miller, University vice
president for research, has been named
provost, filling the post left vacant by
President Lyman's promotion to the
presidency last September 2 4 .
Lyman's selection of Miller was
approved by the Board of Trustees
yesterday. The provost is now the dean
of the faculty, the second ranking
adacemic officer of the University. He
serves as acting president when Lyman
is out of town, and usually deals with
curriculum and budgetary matters. He
now becomes the post as vice preadent for
academic affairs.
Miller was chosen out of a group of
seven nominees recommended by a
faculty-student consultative committee.
The committee, chaired by Alberta
Siegel, a psychologist in the Medical
School, submitted the names in two
groups: four unranked first choice
candidates and three secondary choices.
Miller was one of the top four.
"I am very pleased that Bill Miller is
willing to serve as provost," Lyman
said. "We have had a very satisfactory
working relationship thus far, and I
know we will continue to work well
together in his new position (sic).
"No one is perfect, but Mr. Miller is
very good. He is a man of varied
talents, phenomenal energy, and the
sort of patient persistence in the face of
difficulty that university administration
requires these days."
Miller is currently in Chile attending

a conference of the National Academy
of Sciences.
Here For 6 Years
He came to the University as a
professor of computer science in 1 965 ,
and was appointed head of the
computation group at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center the same
year. He also served as associate provost
for computing before being named to
the newly-created post of vice president
for research last year.
In this position Miller initiated a
survey of the faculty on research
possibilities and uncovered common
areas of interest useful in developing
research programs in such areas as
community development, and
population and environmental controls.
Margie Wolf, former editor of the
Daily and one of three students on the
10-member consultative committee said
the group was more impressed with
Miller the more they found out about
him.
"He is excellent with financial
matters and is very interested in
problem oriented inter-disciplinary
work," she said. "He seems to go out of
his way to meet students and talk with
them."
'Well Qualified'
Professor Siegel called Miller
"exceptionally well qualified," and said
he is "well regarded for his scholarly
contributions, his teaching, and his
excellent judgment on academic
questions."
J. Victor Baldridge, professor of
education and member of the selection
committee, remarked that Miller's
outstanding service as research vice
president and his close working
association with Lyman contributed to
his receiving recommendation from the
group. "W p were looking for two things
in a candidate," he said, "real
administrative ability and outstanding
scholarship. And Miller has both."
Another committee member, and
colleague of Miller, George Forsythe,
professor of computer science said, "He
(Miller) is extraordinarily strong in
knowing how organizations can be
made to work for people. He is a very
hard working individual who listens
well to students."
Lyman describes his new provost as a
quiet man dedicated to his job. "He

of the next dean. Though less than 100

stressed a sympathy for educational
reform, accessibility to students, and
fund raising ability.
