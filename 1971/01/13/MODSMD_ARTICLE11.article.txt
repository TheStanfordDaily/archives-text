Reagan Asks Reform
SACRAMENTO — Gov. Reagan proposed yesterday
to "reform and restructure the entire welfare system"
of the state • "excising the cancer eating at our vitals"
without increasing taxes on hard-working
Californians.
A prime part of his sweeping plan to avert a
disastrous money shortage this coming fiscal yes r is
creation of a "public work force" or persons on
welfare who can't find regular jobs.
Helping save the state's increasingly "debauched"
environment could be one major task of the work
force, he said in his fifth annual "State of the State"
address to the legislature.
At the same time, he added, economies must be
made in all areas of state government "particularly in
welfare and Medi-Cal" - to help prevent an expected
$5 62 million budget deficit next year.
And Reagan urged education reforms, including
starting tuition at state colleges and phasing out
tenure which he called "a haven for the incompetent
teacher." He favored expanding the merit system
instead.
New Steel Imports?
SAN CLEMENTE, Calif. — President Nixon
threatened yesterday to counter what he considers an
enormous price increase by Bethlehem Steel by
inviting expanded imports of lower-cost steel from
Japan and Western Europe.

Nixon was described by his press secretary, Ronald
L. Ziegler, as deeply concerned that the increases
would continue to drive prices up should olher steel
producers follow the Bethlehem lead.
"The increases by Bethlehem steel," Ziegler said,
"relate to products of particular importance to
construction. The President feels that the unusually
large increases in these important prices would have
unfortunate cost-raising effects in the construction
industry where costs have already been virtually out
of control."
Nixon reacted by directing his Cabinet committee
on economic policy to examine the whole situation
and come back with recommendations for action.
School Strike Hits Chicago
More than half a million pupils in Chicago didn't go
to school yesterday because of the second city
teachers' strike in 2 0 months. In Pittsburgh, Mayor
Peter Flaherty and a do/en aids manned trucks for
emergency garbage pickups as a walkout by
nonuniformed city employes reached its eighth day.
Another strike by workers who provide services
directly to the public idled 15,000 telephone
company workers in New York City for a second day.
The union president said they would not abide by a
federal court return-to-work order before Thursday.
The Chicago Teachers Union, representing more
than 8 0 percent of the system's 24,5 00 teachers,
issued the strike order after a four percent pay raise
offer from the school board was rejected.

Union President .John F. Desmond called the offer
an "insult."
The teachers' latest demand was for a 15 percent
increase in salaries that now range from $8,5 0 0 to
$15,015. They also want reductions in class size,
improved protection against assault, and educational
improvements. Desmond said the strike was 98
percent effective among teachers.
Schools Supt. James F. Redmond closed the
schools to the 577,000 pupils.
Mideast Firing Breaks Out
Jordan's government and the Palestinian guerrillas
agreed on a new cease-fire yesterday after five days of
fighting, but firing broke out in Amman barely an
hour after the agreement was announced.
Artillery, mortars and machine guns opened up in
several parts of the city, but by night-fall the shooting
had subsided.
The government accused the guerrillas of opening
fire on a security post near an old Roman citadel in
the city. Authorities claimed that some shells landed
on nearby houses killing two women and wounding
one.
Other attacks on police posts in several areas
followed, and one policeman was wounded in a
shooting incident on Amman's main street, the
government said.
Inhabitants of the capital stayed off the streets
most of the day. Shops were closed and there was no
traffic.
