# Trustee Resigns
## 
### 
Board of Trustees member Charles E.
Dueommon yesterday announced that
he will not seek reappointment for a
second 10-year term on the advice of
his physician.
Dueommon's resignation is the
second from the Board in recent weeks.
Gardiner Symonds, 67, resigned in
November, citing personal reasons.
Last Fall, Dr. Peter S. Bing, 36, was
elected to the Board for a five-year
term. The 28-member Board currently
has five vacancies.
Best remembered for his
performance in a Memorial Auditorium
debate with student radicals in March,
1969, Dueommon said he will continue
"doing everything 1 can to help the
University and probably will be
working harder for it than at any time
in the past."
Dueommon announced to the Board
that he was resigning also, in line with
the Gardner report recommendations
of last year which called for a
reorganization of the Board to reflect a
wider set of interests such as faculty
and alumni.

STILL RAINING—When the only alternatives are the books or the rainy walk
back to the dormitory, Stanford can indeed seem like a gray prison. Can this
student be considering that spring is three long months away?
