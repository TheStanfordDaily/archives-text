# Senate Asserts Jurisdiction Over Council Of Presidents
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
The Student Senate reconfirmed its
appointments made last May to two
Trustee committees over the angry
objection of the ASSU Council of
Presidents last night.
A resolution censuring the presidents
for "conspiring with the President of
the University to replace the designees
of the Senate for Trustee committees
with selections of their own" failed by
an 11 to 1 6 margin. In the heated debate,
ASSU co-president Bob Grant charged,
"See how this petty bickering ties up
the Senate and makes you into an
ineffective body. Yale Braunstein
always brings up something to twit the
nose of the Council of Presidents."
The Trustees had rejected the
nomination of Tim Coburn for the
Land Development and Doug McHenry
for the Planning and Development
committees because the Trustees
claimed the nominations were
unconstitutional.
The Senate, in another resolution,
reminded the Trustees that no student
may sit on a committee until confirmed
by the Senate.

The Nominating Committee, not a
Senate body, had switched McHenry to
the Land Development Committee and
inserted Peter Muhs for the Planning
Committee. The Senate refused to
confirm Muhs and appointed Coburn.
Grant argued that the Senate can
only confirm and not nominate. In the
ASSU Constitution, however,
opponents pointed out that the
Nominating Committee does not have
authority over Trustee Committees.
John Shoch retorted, "You seem to
have a poor memory, Bob. You lost on
this last spring. The Senate has final
authority to interpret the Constitution.
I wish your obstructionism would
cease."
Before the censure vote failed, ASSU
co-president Hal Mickelson remarked,
"Some people might regard a resolution
of censure as the greatest bouquet you
could ever throw us."
After defeating two attempts to
adjourn the three-hour meeting, the
Senate voted to support the Black
Students Union, which has called for a
boycott of University classes, and the

"students and residents of East Palo
Alto in their struggle for community
control of their schools." Black
students at Ravenswood High School
are boycotting classes today to protest
the school desegregation plan which the
EPA community has strenuously
objected to.
Earlier the Senate requested that the
Human Relations Commission
recommend to President Lyman that
the University acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee (Ceasar
Chavez's organization) over products
purchased by the University, whenever
the UFWOC seeks to organize workers
who produce these products.
The Senate confirmed the following
appointments;
Committee on Services to Students—John
Ordway; Committee on Land and Building
Development—Gail Ackerman, Thomas
Peters, Stephen Roulac; Committee on
Public Events—John Kerner, Steve Nissen,
Tom Cristel, Mark Williams; Committee on
International Studies—David Davenport, Karl
Georgi; Committee on Land
Development—Tim Coburn; Committee on
Planning and Development—Doug McHenry.

an 11 to 1 6 margin. In the heated debate,
ASSU co-president Bob Grant charged,
"See how this petty bickering ties up
the Senate and makes you into an
ineffective body. Yale Braunstein
always brings up something to twit the
nose of the Council of Presidents."
The Trustees had rejected the
nomination of Tim Coburn for the
Land Development and Doug McHenry
for the Planning and Development
committees because the Trustees
claimed the nominations were
unconstitutional.
The Senate, in another resolution,
reminded the Trustees that no student
may sit on a committee until confirmed
by the Senate.

The Nominating Committee, not a
Senate body, had switched McHenry to
the Land Development Committee and
inserted Peter Muhs for the Planning
Committee. The Senate refused to
confirm Muhs and appointed Coburn.
Grant argued that the Senate can
only confirm and not nominate. In the
ASSU Constitution, however,
opponents pointed out that the
Nominating Committee does not have
authority over Trustee Committees.
John Shoch retorted, "You seem to
have a poor memory, Bob. You lost on
this last spring. The Senate has final
authority to interpret the Constitution.
I wish your obstructionism would
cease."
Before the censure vote failed, ASSU
co-president Hal Mickelson remarked,
"Some people might regard a resolution
of censure as the greatest bouquet you
could ever throw us."
After defeating two attempts to
adjourn the three-hour meeting, the
Senate voted to support the Black
Students Union, which has called for a
boycott of University classes, and the

"students and residents of East Palo
Alto in their struggle for community
control of their schools." Black
students at Ravenswood High School
are boycotting classes today to protest
the school desegregation plan which the
EPA community has strenuously
objected to.
Earlier the Senate requested that the
Human Relations Commission
recommend to President Lyman that
the University acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the United Farm
Workers Organizing Committee (Ceasar
Chavez's organization) over products
purchased by the University, whenever
the UFWOC seeks to organize workers
who produce these products.
The Senate confirmed the following
appointments;
Committee on Services to Students—John
Ordway; Committee on Land and Building
Development—Gail Ackerman, Thomas
Peters, Stephen Roulac; Committee on
Public Events—John Kerner, Steve Nissen,
Tom Cristel, Mark Williams; Committee on
International Studies—David Davenport, Karl
Georgi; Committee on Land
Development—Tim Coburn; Committee on
Planning and Development—Doug McHenry.
The Student Senate reconfirmed its
appointments made last May to two
Trustee committees over the angry
objection of the ASSU Council of
Presidents last night.
A resolution censuring the presidents
for "conspiring with the President of
the University to replace the designees
of the Senate for Trustee committees
with selections of their own" failed by
an 11 to 1 6 margin. In the heated debate,
ASSU co-president Bob Grant charged,
