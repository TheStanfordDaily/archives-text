# Speech Disruption Offends Audience, Lyman Declares
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In his first KZSU press conference of
the quarter, President Richard Lyman
declared last night that Monday's
disruption of Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech was "less against Mr. Lodge than
against the audience. . .who wished to
hear whatever it was he came here to
say.
"A university can't afford to have
potential audiences for all sorts of
speakers one by one deprived of their
opportunities because a limited but
very vehement minority wishes to
deprive them," Lyman added.
Surrounded by hot klieg lights and
TV cameras from KPIX, KRON, and
the National Broadcasting Company,
Lyman concluded his opening
statement by saying, "Freedom for
people you agree with is no real
freedom at all. Freedom for people you
feel mildly about is not very hard to
achieve.
"It's freedom to listen to the full
expression of points of view which you
regard as sinful or disastrous or
catastrophic in their outcome—that's
when freedom really means
something."
He added that the University
administration was "looking into the
episode."
Evidence Being Collected
"We are trying to collect evidence as
to who did it, and prosecution will
follow from that."
Arena co-editor Chris Hocker asked
Lyman if he could justify retaining
individuals on the faculty who "could
be said to be acting counter to the
interests of academic freedom."
"There are procedures for coping
with faculty. . .who show themselves in
one way or another to be unfit or to
break established canons of University
behavior," Lyman responded.

"Those procedures exist, and there is
no reason to think that faculty and
staff are in any way different. . .from
students in their obligation to allow
freedom of speech on campus."
Two reporters quizzed Lyman on
possible methods of preventing a
demonstration such as Monday's in the
future. He responded that "the
protection of freedom on the campus is
a very difficult and sensitive matter,
and one always has to be careful that
'he steps one takes to try to preserve

freedom do not result in cutting off
more freedom than they preserve."
Nothing Dramatic
He also noted, "We have nothing
dramatic to propose in the way of
means of preventing this.
"Accountability after the fact is an
important aspect in this case. When it
happens, something should follow from
it, besides just clicking tongues and
expressions of sympathy in the
newspapers."

TRESIDDER DISCUSSION—Even in the middle of winter students meet at 'IVesidder to talk—and even outside. Perhaps
they're discussing the rain.
