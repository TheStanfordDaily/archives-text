# Ehrlich Appointed To Post As Manning Replacement

### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Thomas Ehrlich, a quiet, scholarly
Harvard-trained law professor, was
named dean of the Law School
yesterday to succeed retiring head
Bayless Manning.
An expert on international law and
legal education, the 3 6-year old Ehrlich
will be one of the youngest law deans
in the country. Two years ago he led
efforts to overhaul the Law School's
curriculum, giving students a chance to
take more electives and to study
off-campus on "extern" programs.
Ehrlich will become dean on Sept. 1
and will replace Manning who
announced his retirement last
September.
In making the appointment,
President Richard Lyman said, "Tom
Ehrlich will be an outstanding dean of
an outstanding law school. He is young,
but already he has shown great capacity
in fields ranging from public affairs to
reform of the curriculum."
Ehrlich was chosen from a three-man

list submitted to Lyman last fall by a
Law School committee of faculty,
students, and administrator Robert
Rosenzweig.
Committee member Jack Charney,
third year student and president of the
Law Students Association, said Ehrlich
is "very popular with the faculty."
Though Charney felt disadvantaged on
the search committee because of a lack
of familiarity with many of the
candidates, he said is "very satisfied
with the results."
Other students, who refused to be
named, felt Ehrlich would be
handicapped by his "shy" personality
and "lack of rapport" with students.
However,most of the law students, they
felt, had little interest in deciding who
would succeed Manning and preferred
to leave the matter up to the Law
School faculty.
During the fall, when Ehrlich
appeared the leading candidate, a poll
was taken to determine what criteria

doesn't come on like gang busters,"
Lyman said, "but he impresses
everyone who gets to know him."
The new provost will inherit a
substantial staff, developed under
Lyman when he held the position.
The appointment of Miller, a
scientist, continues a pattern of
balancing an historian and a scientist or
engineer in the two top academic
offices of the University. Lyman, an
historian, served under chemist
Kenneth Pitzer, and Frederick Terman,
an engineer, was provost to President J.
E. Wallace Sterling, a history scholar.
