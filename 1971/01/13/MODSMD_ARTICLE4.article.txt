# GSU Takes Shape
## Gay Students Drop Straight Roles 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
"We're all in this together," Fred
says, smiling a little self-consciously.
"This variety is something to be
praised, something to be thankful for."
And he leans back in his rocking-chair,
puffs slowly on his pipe, and smiles
again.
Fred Oakford is one of some 100
members of the Gay Students Union
(GSU) here. Along with Maud
Haimson, another GSU member,
Oakford has been writing articles and
holding meetings in residence halls to
get the GSU out into the open, to let
"straights" know it exists, to make it
easier for "gays" to accept their
homosexuality.
As Haimson said in one of her
articles, "It is the public perspective of
a lesbian as one who lacks something,
rather than as one who loves another
woman. Anyone who can love in this
spciety should be praised."

According to Oakford, the
homosexual here is faced with awesome
problems.
"At Stanford, there haven't been the
traditional underground channels of
meeting other gay people. Some people
experience a terrible kind of loneliness
and frustration. . .We're really a social
organization—a lot of the sense of a
meeting is really just a polite fiction to
get people to come and meet each
other, which is where the work takes
place. We're not really interested in
demonstrations or marches."
GSU Launched
The Gay Students Union here was
formed two months ago, after
"Adjusting to Gay Life," an article by
Maud Haimson, appeared anonymoully
in the Daily. Meeting announcements,
with a post office box given in the
place of time and location, began
appearing in "Once Around the Quad."
It was out of these weekly meetings,
held in various apartments in Palo Alto,
that the GSU was launched.
The meetings are now advertised
openly, and many GSU members—like
Oakford and Haimson, who have since
published a signed article—have given
up their anonymity. Most, however, are
still "incognito," as one member (who
preferred not to have his name printed)
said—"but that may change."
Some 30 or 4 0 members now attend
each meeting. About half are Stanford
students; the rest are students and
other residents of the Palo Alto area.
Only a few are women; out of a total
membership of 100, women number
less than 20. "Girls are generally more
inhibited about this sort of thing," one
member explained. "It's largely true
that the group is very male-oriented.
We're trying to get more girls to come
out. . .in our own way we're trying to
avoid being sexist."

"It's just an opportunity to make
friends of a somewhat different type,"
Oakford explained. "I guess it must be
something like the days before co-ed
dorms, when guys needed opportunities
to meet girls. . . .Sexual relations are
very complex—they operate on a
thousand different levels of
interaction—and this is true with gay
people. It's nice to go and be in a room
full of gay guys, even if you're talking
about Richard Nixon, or cuisine, or
what-have-you. There's a sense of a
different male presence—often, a sense
of a shared secret."
The GSU is partly an attempt to get
that secret out in the open, to help the
"closet cases" who attempt to hide
their homosexuality from their
associates, friends, and family. But
Oakford emphasizes that the GSU is
not connected with the more radical
Gay Liberation Front in San Francisco
and Berkeley. "The people (in GSU)
who are radical are radical politically. .
.we're interested not in politics, not in
laws, but in developing the finer points
of social contact. And prejudice against
gays is based much more on ignorance

than is prejudice against blacks, which
is generally based on some kind of
limited experience. I don't think the
discrimination is nearly as bad—but I
don't like to use the analogy."
Little Intolerance
Earlier this year, Oakford quietly
told the residents of his house—he lives
in Stern Hall—that he is gay. He did not
experience any intolerance, and doesn't
feel he's lost any of his straight friends
as a result.
"I think there's a certain pride in
being gay," Oakford said, and admitted
with a chuckle that the GSU had
considered buying bumper stickers that
read, "I'm glad to be gay."
"What matters to me," he said, "is
the ability to come to a loving
relationship—and I do that with
another male. . .1 don't feel superior,
but I am pleased that I am able to
engage in a loving relationship.
Homosexuality is good in a sense that it
holds up an example that everyone can
learn from. . .and with depopulation,
homosexuality will become, along with
marriage without children, more
socially desirable. As I said, we're all in
this together."
"We're all in this together," Fred
says, smiling a little self-consciously.

held in various apartments in Palo Alto,
that the GSU was launched.
The meetings are now advertised
openly, and many GSU members—like
Oakford and Haimson, who have since
published a signed article—have given
up their anonymity. Most, however, are
still "incognito," as one member (who
preferred not to have his name printed)
said—"but that may change."
Some 30 or 4 0 members now attend
each meeting. About half are Stanford
students; the rest are students and
other residents of the Palo Alto area.
Only a few are women; out of a total
membership of 100, women number
less than 20. "Girls are generally more
inhibited about this sort of thing," one
member explained. "It's largely true
that the group is very male-oriented.
We're trying to get more girls to come
out. . .in our own way we're trying to
avoid being sexist."

"It's just an opportunity to make
friends of a somewhat different type,"
Oakford explained. "I guess it must be
something like the days before co-ed
dorms, when guys needed opportunities
to meet girls. . . .Sexual relations are
very complex—they operate on a
thousand different levels of
interaction—and this is true with gay
people. It's nice to go and be in a room
full of gay guys, even if you're talking
about Richard Nixon, or cuisine, or
what-have-you. There's a sense of a
different male presence—often, a sense
of a shared secret."
The GSU is partly an attempt to get
that secret out in the open, to help the
"closet cases" who attempt to hide
their homosexuality from their
associates, friends, and family. But
Oakford emphasizes that the GSU is
not connected with the more radical
Gay Liberation Front in San Francisco
and Berkeley. "The people (in GSU)
who are radical are radical politically. .
.we're interested not in politics, not in
laws, but in developing the finer points
of social contact. And prejudice against
gays is based much more on ignorance

than is prejudice against blacks, which
is generally based on some kind of
limited experience. I don't think the
discrimination is nearly as bad—but I
don't like to use the analogy."
Little Intolerance
Earlier this year, Oakford quietly
told the residents of his house—he lives
in Stern Hall—that he is gay. He did not
experience any intolerance, and doesn't
feel he's lost any of his straight friends
as a result.
"I think there's a certain pride in
being gay," Oakford said, and admitted
with a chuckle that the GSU had
considered buying bumper stickers that
read, "I'm glad to be gay."
"What matters to me," he said, "is
the ability to come to a loving
relationship—and I do that with
another male. . .1 don't feel superior,
but I am pleased that I am able to
engage in a loving relationship.
Homosexuality is good in a sense that it
holds up an example that everyone can
learn from. . .and with depopulation,
homosexuality will become, along with
marriage without children, more
socially desirable. As I said, we're all in
this together."
"We're all in this together," Fred
says, smiling a little self-consciously.
"This variety is something to be
praised, something to be thankful for."
And he leans back in his rocking-chair,
puffs slowly on his pipe, and smiles
again.
Fred Oakford is one of some 100
members of the Gay Students Union
(GSU) here. Along with Maud
Haimson, another GSU member,
Oakford has been writing articles and
holding meetings in residence halls to
get the GSU out into the open, to let
"straights" know it exists, to make it
easier for "gays" to accept their
homosexuality.
As Haimson said in one of her
articles, "It is the public perspective of
a lesbian as one who lacks something,
rather than as one who loves another
woman. Anyone who can love in this
spciety should be praised."

According to Oakford, the
homosexual here is faced with awesome
problems.
"At Stanford, there haven't been the
traditional underground channels of
meeting other gay people. Some people
experience a terrible kind of loneliness
and frustration. . .We're really a social
organization—a lot of the sense of a
meeting is really just a polite fiction to
get people to come and meet each
other, which is where the work takes
place. We're not really interested in
demonstrations or marches."
GSU Launched
The Gay Students Union here was
formed two months ago, after
"Adjusting to Gay Life," an article by
Maud Haimson, appeared anonymoully
in the Daily. Meeting announcements,
with a post office box given in the
place of time and location, began
appearing in "Once Around the Quad."

Oakford emphasizes that the GSU is
not connected with the more radical
Gay Liberation Front in San Francisco
and Berkeley. "The people (in GSU)
who are radical are radical politically. .
.we're interested not in politics, not in
laws, but in developing the finer points
of social contact. And prejudice against
gays is based much more on ignorance

than is prejudice against blacks, which
is generally based on some kind of
limited experience. I don't think the
discrimination is nearly as bad—but I
don't like to use the analogy."
Little Intolerance
Earlier this year, Oakford quietly
told the residents of his house—he lives
in Stern Hall—that he is gay. He did not
experience any intolerance, and doesn't
feel he's lost any of his straight friends
as a result.
"I think there's a certain pride in
being gay," Oakford said, and admitted
with a chuckle that the GSU had
considered buying bumper stickers that
read, "I'm glad to be gay."
"What matters to me," he said, "is
the ability to come to a loving
relationship—and I do that with
another male. . .1 don't feel superior,
but I am pleased that I am able to
engage in a loving relationship.
Homosexuality is good in a sense that it
holds up an example that everyone can
learn from. . .and with depopulation,
homosexuality will become, along with
marriage without children, more
socially desirable. As I said, we're all in
this together."
"We're all in this together," Fred
says, smiling a little self-consciously.
"This variety is something to be
praised, something to be thankful for."
And he leans back in his rocking-chair,
puffs slowly on his pipe, and smiles
again.
Fred Oakford is one of some 100
members of the Gay Students Union
(GSU) here. Along with Maud
Haimson, another GSU member,
Oakford has been writing articles and
holding meetings in residence halls to
get the GSU out into the open, to let
"straights" know it exists, to make it
easier for "gays" to accept their
homosexuality.
As Haimson said in one of her
articles, "It is the public perspective of
a lesbian as one who lacks something,
rather than as one who loves another
woman. Anyone who can love in this
spciety should be praised."

According to Oakford, the
homosexual here is faced with awesome
problems.
"At Stanford, there haven't been the
traditional underground channels of
meeting other gay people. Some people
experience a terrible kind of loneliness
and frustration. . .We're really a social
organization—a lot of the sense of a
meeting is really just a polite fiction to
get people to come and meet each
other, which is where the work takes
place. We're not really interested in
demonstrations or marches."
GSU Launched
The Gay Students Union here was
formed two months ago, after
"Adjusting to Gay Life," an article by
Maud Haimson, appeared anonymoully
in the Daily. Meeting announcements,
with a post office box given in the
place of time and location, began
appearing in "Once Around the Quad."
It was out of these weekly meetings,
held in various apartments in Palo Alto,
that the GSU was launched.
The meetings are now advertised
openly, and many GSU members—like
Oakford and Haimson, who have since
published a signed article—have given
up their anonymity. Most, however, are
still "incognito," as one member (who
preferred not to have his name printed)
said—"but that may change."
Some 30 or 4 0 members now attend
each meeting. About half are Stanford
students; the rest are students and
other residents of the Palo Alto area.
Only a few are women; out of a total
membership of 100, women number
less than 20. "Girls are generally more
inhibited about this sort of thing," one
member explained. "It's largely true
that the group is very male-oriented.
We're trying to get more girls to come
out. . .in our own way we're trying to
avoid being sexist."

"It's just an opportunity to make
friends of a somewhat different type,"
Oakford explained. "I guess it must be
something like the days before co-ed
dorms, when guys needed opportunities
to meet girls. . . .Sexual relations are
very complex—they operate on a
thousand different levels of
interaction—and this is true with gay
people. It's nice to go and be in a room
full of gay guys, even if you're talking
about Richard Nixon, or cuisine, or
what-have-you. There's a sense of a
different male presence—often, a sense
of a shared secret."
The GSU is partly an attempt to get
that secret out in the open, to help the
"closet cases" who attempt to hide
their homosexuality from their
associates, friends, and family. But
Oakford emphasizes that the GSU is
not connected with the more radical
Gay Liberation Front in San Francisco
and Berkeley. "The people (in GSU)
who are radical are radical politically. .
.we're interested not in politics, not in
laws, but in developing the finer points
