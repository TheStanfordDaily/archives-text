# Priests, Nuns Charged In Kidnapping Plot
## 
### 
WASHINGTON â€” The government
yesterday indicted imprisoned antiwar
priest Phillip Berrigan and five other
persons on charges of plotting to
kidnap presidential advisor Henry A.
Kissinger and blow up heating systems
in federal buildings.
FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover earlier
linked the alleged plot to a move to
force the United States out of Vietnam
and release "political prisoners" in this
country.
Eight other persons, including
Berrigan's brother Daniel, also a Roman
Catholic priest, were named as
co-conspirators in the alleged plot.
Altogether, three priests, a former
priest and a nun were cited as plotters
and three nuns, a priest and a former
priest as co-conspirators.
Both Berrigan brothers are serving
federal prison sentences for pouring
home-made napalm on Selective Service
System records at Catonsville, Md., in
1 968, along with other members of the
"Catonsville Nine."
Hoover told Congress last November
the alleged conspirators planned to
kidnap Kissinger, Nixon's chief foreign
policy adviser, and hold him until the
United States dropped all participation
in Vietnam and released the "political
prisoners."
Hoover declared the plan to kidnap
Kissinger and blow up heating systems
in government buildings in Washington
was the work of a group calling itself
the "East Coast Conspiracy to Save
Lives."
Spokesmen for the group later
denied the Berrigans were members and
the brothers challenged Hoover to
retract his statement or prosecute.

The indictment said the six
conspired to "maliciously damage and
destroy by means of explosives" federal
building heating systems at five
locations next February 22, George
Washington's Birthday.
The indictment did not mention
specific demands, but said Kissinger
would be held until certain demands of
the alleged plotters were met.
The six named in the alleged plot
were arrested after a grand jury in
Harrisburg, Pa., returned a sealed
seven-count indictment.
Both Phillip Berrigan, 47, and
Daniel, 49, a Jesuit, are serving out
their sentences at a federal prison in
Danbury, Conn.
Daniel eluded federal authorities for
four months with the help of
sympathizers in the antiwar
underground. Two of those who
allegedly sheltered him were arrested
later.
Phillip drew a six-year sentence and
Daniel three years.
All the defendents are in jail on
previous convictions involving antiwar
activity.
The charges include conspiracy to
damage government property,
conspiracy to possess unregistered
dynamite and other explosives,
conspiracy to take the explosives across
state lines, and conspiracy to kidnap
and take the victim across state lines.
The indictment said as part of the
conspiracy the six were to obtain maps
and diagrams of the underground
tunnels in Washington D. C. that
contain heating systems for the
government buildings.
