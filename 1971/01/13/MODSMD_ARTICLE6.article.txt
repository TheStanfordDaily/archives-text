toleration
Editor, THE DAILY:
Monday the Stanford radicals
gave us a beautiful demonstration
of their belief in free speech,
justice, and toleration of differing
viewpoints: they refused to allow
Henry Cabot Lodge to speak at
Dinkelspiel, even in his capacity as
UN ambassador and on such an
uncontroversial topic as the UN's
role in the world. Crying "Peace,"
the radicals sowed more
bitterness, division, and hate.
Shouting "Power to the People,"
a group of 19 kept all the people
in the overflowing auditorium
from hearing a speaker they had
wanted to hear.
"They didn't let Angela Davis
speak. Why should we let Lodge?"
the radicals yelled, (unwittingly?)
committing the same repression
committed by the UC regents,
who refused students the chance
to hear a black communist's
viewpoint. I must thank the
revolutionaries who won their
great "victory" in Dinkelspiel
yesterday; it is so comforting to
know that from the hypocrisy,
the hate, and the inhumanity of
Nixon and his administration I

can only turn to the hypocrisy,
hate and inhumanity of the Left.

racism
Editor, THE DAILY:
If the impressions gained from
Eve Kaufman's article yesterday
are correct, then it appears that
racism in the Stanford
Community is being sustained as
much by the attitudes of the
ethnic minorities as by any
actions of the rest of the
community.
Please note the definition of
"racism" given by Gene Tom:
"the sum total of overt and covert
practices utilized by the white
majority population to suppress
the rights of ethnic
minorities ..." What a tautology!
By definition, anyone other than
a white person is excluded from
harboring feelings of racial
prejudice. Any critical observer
can see the complete inadequacy
of this definition. If Mr. Tom's
experience is so parochial in scope

that he things that such a
definition is fair, then perhaps he
should reevaluate his ability to
make such a sweeping
generalization.
Consider secondly, the
paranoid fear exhibited in the
statement of Manuel Dias. He
feels that even though,
admittedly, he has never
experienced any racism at
Stanford, he must still be
defensive because of his "past
experiences." As long as this fear
of the past remains, as long as the
ethnic minority groups continue
to search for racism in every word
or action of the white population,
we will never see the day when
the peoples of this world,
regardless of color, can relate to
each other as human beings,
rather than as representatives of
opposing factions.
Consider finally, what Kermit
Lucas told Miss Kaufman.
"Loving your own race more than
another is not racism." Implicit in
that statement is the assumption
that one race is inherently better

and therefore more worthy of
respect than another. I think, that
that assumption is completely
unwarranted. And to deny that
that is not racism is certainly
stretching a point.
Discrimination because of race,
i.e., loving the black race because
it is black and not because of the
merit of the people who make up
the race, is certainly racism,
whether Mr. Lucas could not be a
racist since he is not white. There
can be only one reason for
respecting a person. And that is
because he is a worthwhile human
being.
If one has a sense of pride
based on the color of his skin,
then that is a false pride. He had
nothing to do with choosing the
color of his skin. One can only
pride himself on what he has
accomplished since birth. If a man
is respected as a human being,
then the color of his skin is
meaningless. If a man cannot be
respected as a human being, then
he does not deserve to be
respected because of the color of
his skin either.
If, indeed, it is true that none
are free unless all are free, then it
will be only through the sincere
efforts of all the people of the
world, not just an attitudinal
change on the part of the white
majority, that we will finally
realize Martin Luther King's
dream: "Free at last; thank God
Almighty, we are free at last."

no monopoly
Editor, THE DAILY:

As I reflect on the disruption of
Monday's speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge, I find it incomprehensible
that people associated with a
university • that segment of our
society dedicated to the notion
that all points of view deserve a
hearing • should feel that they are
furthering the purposes of a
university by the repression of
points of view with which they
disagree. I have been worried for
some time about repression from
the right, particularly in the state
of California, but it is apparent
after Monday's performance that
the right has no monopoly on that
ugly vice.
Those who support such tactics
seem (a) to believe in free speech
only for those with whom they
agree (a very elitist view of
society), and (b) to insist on
determining in advance whom the
rest of us shall be permitted to
hear (a very repressive view of
society). The right of exchange of
divergent viewpoints is a frail, and
absolutely necessary, structure in
a democratic society, and the
university, whatever else it is,
must be the place in that society
where such a structure can not
only survive but thrive. I hope,
with a kind of despairing hope,
that members of this community
will disavow such tactics in the
future as an utter denial of what a
university is meant to be, so that
Stanford can still be one of the
forums in a sick nation where free
exchange is possible.
