# Campus Concerts Continue

There have been many
questions as to how much Sly's
Frost concert cooled A.S.S.U.
finances, whether the Moody
Blues sent the Special Events
Board into fits of depression or
ecstasy, and what plans there are
for future concerts here.
Adam Levin of the A.S.S.U.
Council of Presidents, discussing
the Sly concert, its entertainment
success, and its 5 00 dollar
financia' failure, told the DAILY,
"Despite the 8,600 paid
admissions, lighting expenses and
security, expenses prompted this
loss. We had to light the stage, the

ampitheatre, the parking lots, and
the area around the fences. In
addition Santa Clara County
Sheriffs, Campus Security Policy,
and Student Police ran up our
expenses considerably."
Levin added that the Friday
night before the U.S.C. game was
the only possible time for the
concert since Sunday afternoon
people would have either been too
happy or too zonked to go to the
concert. The contract with Sly
had been made during the
summer, well before Sly's
no-show in Chicago.
Sly was chosen because the first
concert had to be spectacular if it

was to set the trend for other
concerts. With the first rate
entertainment available in the Bay
Area, Special Events had to offer
someone who couldn't be seen
elsewhere in the area.
The man behind the concerts
on campus is Mark Randolph,
vice-chairman of Special Events in
charge of concerts. Mark discussed
the Moody Blues concert which
had sold out with ease and reaped
a $35 00 profit. "Everything went
smoothly except for the
appearance of Trapeze (the group
was held at customs and replaced
by Elvin Bishop at the expense of
the Moody Blues) and the crowd
created an incredibly unique
atmosphere."
The central problem with
concerts in Maples Pavilion is the
floor. Athletic department
officials who grant the use of the
Pavilion to Special Events are
concerned that the floor is ruined
from cigarette burns or spills from
liquids brought in. An asbestos
cover may be tested at the next
concert. Another problem is
created by the audience jumping
on the "floating" floor which is
supported by sand since athletic
department officials see this
"observable trampoline effect," as
something which the blueprints
didn't call for.

Randolph noted that "people
don't realize what an incredible
hassle planning a concert is. First
we have to find a date that the
athletic department will let us
have their facility; then we have
to get the date the University,
drama department, and music
department approve of; finally we
have to spend weeks tracking
down the groups which students
have indicated in the poll which
was taken and try to book them."
Since groups prefer fall and spring
concerts, winter quarter has been
a rough time for planning concerts
for Randolph and his committee.
Special Events was able to
announce two definite concerts
upcoming, the Fireside Theatre on
February 5 th, and Chicago on
April 16 th. Other dates in
February' and April may soon be
announced. The on-campus
concert prices for tickets will
hopefully be subsidized for
students by a floating fund
formed from the profits of
concerts. The $2.75 tab for
Moody Blues was a bargain
compared with the $7.50 tickets
which were sold at their Los
Angeles concert and future
concerts promise to deliver similar
savings.
