At a luncheon with the DAIL Y editors 44 years ago,
the then president of Stanford, Dr. Jordan, was asked,
"What is your opinion regarding apparitions and such
supernatural phenomena?" After some understandable

friends at 321-2300 ext. 4632. Who knows, it may make
Page One! If you're selling your chuckles at the same
]|| time, call our business office at 327-4150.
