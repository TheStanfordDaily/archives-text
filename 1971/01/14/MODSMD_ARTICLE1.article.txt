# Kennedy.. Biologist, Administrator
## 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
Donald Kennedy does not at ail fit
the stereotyped image of a potential
Harvard president.
His thin-frammed, tortoise-shell
glasses; eastern tweed sports jacket; and
characteristic long, green cigar, leave
one with the impression that he just
stepped out of a modernized Henry
James novel instead of almost stepping
into one of the highest academic post
in the United States.
Although he was not chosen for the
office, Kennedy, 40, said that it was "a
flattering surprise" to make the final
list of 23. "On the other hand," he
added, "I was flattered but not cajoled.
I never thought seriously about the
job." Even if the post had been offered,
Kennedy said that he "probably
wouldn't have accepted it."
"There are other people on that list
with kinds of experience and native
skills more useful than mine," he said.
"Long range planning, sustained
administrative experience, and good
practical economic sense are not among
my strong points."
Somewhat modest about his
administrative skills, Kennedy has
effected progressive improvements in
the core curriculum of the Biology
department here since becoming its
chairman five years ago. Kennedy
redesigned the core requirements from
a six to a four quarter series. Student
suggestions were also considered in
making additional course content
changes.
Concern for Students
His concern for students carries into
his duties as an administrator. In an
effort to ease the transition from the
old Biology core, Kennedy has set up
20 new junior seminars for students
caught in the change.

However, with only 18 faculty in the
biology department, and 4 30 declared
majors, Kennedy sees no alternative to
large lectures in the program's core
courses. A firm believer in lectures as
an effective teaching tool, he stated
that the way to help students who feel
lost in a large lecture is to improve the
lecture, not to turn it into a seminar.
Kennedy strongly supports student
participation in the affairs of the
Biology department. Three years ago he
gave students voting positions on major
policy committees in the department
and has also allowed students on
committees which choose new faculty
members.
He feels that the University should
always be receptive to new ideas,
regardless of whether these ideas come
from students or faculty members.
Yet he is careful to draw the line
between productive and destructive
student action. Although he agrees with
many of the reasons behind student
protest, Kennedy feels that such
protest should not be directed at the
university, but instead at the sources of
the problems.
He also feels that frustration caused
by the individual's inability to change
things should not be manifested in
"trashing," but in some more
productive action.
Neurophysiology
True to this philosophy, Kennedy
has redirected much of his efforts away
from his specialty of neurophysiology
to what he terms the "politics of
science." In connection with this, he
has recently published a pamphlet
entitled "The Destruction of
Indochina."
The pamphlet was a product of
intensive research done by Kennedy
and other members of the Stanford

Biology Study Group and dealt with
the ecological destruction wreaked on
Indochina by United States' bombing
and chemical defoliation. Since its
publication last spring, the pamphlet
has been sold by the thousands and
read into the Congressional Record by
Congressman Pete McCloskey.
Not all the Kennedy's time is spent
on political activism, however, for he
considers himself first and foremost an
educator. He possesses an uncanny
ability to divide his time between his
duties as a teacher, a researcher and an
administrator without neglecting any
area.
One of his students described
Kennedy as "a man who is intensely
involved in everything he does . . . a
personable guy. He is never pretentious
or stuffy, and is always willing to help
students who request his advice.
Reputed to be an excellent lecturer,
Kennedy has the rare stage capability
to combine facts and humor in perfect
proportions. Almost everyone who has
ever taken one of his courses has been
treated to his bi-annual performance of
"It's a long way from Amphioxus."
This little ditty, sung to the tune of

"It's a long way to Tipperary,"
concerns man's evolution from the
primitive fish Amphioxus.
"Goodby fins and gill slits/ Hello
teeth and hair/ It's a long way from
Amphioxus/ But we came from there."
"By the Back Door"
Kennedy readily admits that he
entered his specialty of
neurophysiology "bv the back door."
As a Harvard undergraduate, his
biological interests were focused mainly
on ecology.
Then, in 1954, after "getting into
Harvard graduate school "by the skin
of my teeth," his interest began to turn
trom the natural history aspect of
biology to its behavior aspect. From
there it was a natural step to his present
Held of expertise, neurophysiology.
A member of the Faculty Senate
here, Kennedy says that he really
enjoys being an administrator and
researcher along with teaching both
graduate and undergraduate students.
Yet in a few years, he plans to give up
his administrative duties as head of the
biology department.
"Six or seven years is about right for
a department chairman. After that,
things begin to fossilize."
