Oil Pipeline Approved
WASHINGTON — The Interior Department held Wednesday that Alaskan oil is
important to the nation that a pipeline for its delivery must be built even at the
inevitable cost of some damage to the environment.
In an environmental impact statement required by law, department staff
members conceded that some unavoidable environmental costs would be incurred
through construction and operation of an 8 00-mile pipeline from the frozen
North Slope of Alaska to a southern port at Valdez.
And it acknowledged that oil spills, either from the pipeline or from the port
facilities and 1 20,000 ton tankers that would carry away the oil, may endanger
valuable wildlife and fishing resources.
But the report concluded development of the North Slope oil reserves
discovered in 1 968 is "essential to the strength, growth and security of the United
States."
It is said requirements imposed by the department upon the design and
operation of the pipeline system "would reduce foreseeable environmental costs
to acceptable levels."
But the major unavoidable impact, it conceded, is that the pipeline "would
bridge the barriers that maintained the arctic wilderness in its pristine state.

"It is clearly recognized that no stipulation can alter the fundamental change
that development would bring to this area.
"Whether this transition is adverse or advantageous is a matter of value
judgment."
Police Accused In UCLA Report
LOS ANGELES — Police were accused Wednesday of "creating violence"
during a May 5, 1970 student demonstration at the University of California
campus here in a report by a campus commission appointed by Chancellor Charles
E. Young.
"Individual officers physically attacked innocent persons, inflicting many
injuries, some very serious," the commission said.
The report, long delayed, also said police reacted well to an initial disturbance
and that it was the over reaction of students that then created a hostile situation
which led to harsh police action.
The report, released by the "Chancellor's Commission on the Events of May 5,
197 0," listed a series of episodes detailing police action against individuals "for no
sensible reason." It also declared some of the violence might have been averted
had the administration heeded earlier demands of Mexican-American students.
The report said police action appeared to be directed at "long-hairs" and
minority group students.
Security Tightened In Britain
LONDON — The government ordered tightened security at the homes of all
Cabinet ministers Wednesday following an attempt at the first political murder of
a British government minister in more than 150 years.
Two time bombs regarded by police as an assassination attempt exploded late
Tuesday night at the home of Employment Minister Robert Carr. The minister
and his family escaped unhurt.
But the attempt alone was enough to produce an outraged reaction across this
nation that prides itself on traditions of free and reasoned debate and an
abhorrence of political violence.
Home Secretary Reginald Maulding vowed that "every possible lesson" would
be learned from the bombing of Carr's home and "every effort made to bring
those who did it to book."
Chancellor Criticized
SACRAMENTO — Sixty-seven state college faculty members, saying they
were "close to desperation," asked Chancellor Glenn Dumke Wednesday to
re-examine his administrative policies.
"We have all been dismayed to witness during the past year a series of policy
recommendations and administrative actions that have stripped the faculties of
responsibilities previously delegated to them. And we are alarmed at the growing
disregard for normal consultative and advisory processes in favor of unilateral
decisions," the 6 7 said in an open letter to Dumke.
