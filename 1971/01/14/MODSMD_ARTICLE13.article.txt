# Financial Losses Alter TMU Policy
## 
### JIM ALMAS 
A worsening financial situation has
forced Tresidder Union cafeteria service
to close at 8 p.m. The cafeteria
formally remained open until 11:30
p.m. Other changes in Tresidder
services may be imminent.
Tresidder Director Forrest E. Tregea
feels TMU's primary purpose is to
provide services, amenities and
conveniences to the community.
"Making a profit, must take a back
seat," he states.
Hut TMU has never finished a year in
the black. Last year, Tresidder's
"backseat" losses cost the University
over $100,000.
According to Tresidder's Business
Manager P.G. Duffy, losses come from
many Tresidder services. He estimates
losses between $10,000 to $20,0 00
from vandalism, abuse, and theft of
trays, eating utensils, and other items.
Much of Tresidder's space is reserved
for free meeting rooms for any campus
organization up on request, and 2,5 00
square feet is reserved for ASSU offices
at a charge of $1 a year. But even more
important than the loss of income from
these services is the loss of student and
community patronage plaguing the
union.
Changing Styles
Duffy sees increasing competition
and the changing life-styles as being
two of the reasons fewer students use
the Union. Vending machines, catering
trucks, and lounges in many
departments have cut down on the
cafeteria's business. While the cafeteria
tries to keep its prices competitive,
wages have risen. He points out that
just a few years ago TMU provided the
University's only Friday and Saturday

night film series. Today, films overlap
almost every night.
Tom Caughlin, a student member of
the Tresidder Union Committee, sees
another possible reason for TMU's
gradual decline. He notes that many
students aren't aware of the various
services the Union provides.
While nearly everyone is aware of the
check-cashing service, cafeteria, and
bowling lanes, few people are aware of
the browsing rooms with newspapers
from across the country, the collection
of 800 records, and the table room
with chess sets and other equipment.
He notes that only on rare ocasions
does TMU advertise.
New Alternatives
The crisis at Tresidder may be
further complicated by the University's
Budget Adjustment Program (BAP).
But the situation is not as bleak as it
may appear at first glance. Tregea,
Duffy, and the Tresidder Committee
are all actively seeking new alternatives
and projects to strengthen the Union.
Tregea best sums up their
philosophy. "The meaning of the
Union is to unifyâ€”it's a way of bringing
people together," he said. "As a Union
we try to provide something for
everybody."
The Coffee house is a case in point.
Tregea notes that at lunchtime, the
Coffee house is heavily patronized by
"non-coffee house types of people."
Many secretaries and other campus
employees now mingle with students
and other members of the community.
In a sense the Coffee house is what
Tregea is aiming for. But whether the
University and the community can
afford such expensive operations is a
question which will continue to plague
the Union.
