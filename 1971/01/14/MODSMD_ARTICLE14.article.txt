Seven Charged
Seven more students were charged
yesterday by the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) on charges stemming
from the disruption Monday of a
speech by Henry Cabot Lodge, former
ambassador to the United Nations.
This brings the total number of
indictments to nine, with John
Schwartz, special assistant to the
president, expecting another five or six
indictments to go out shortly. No
names have been released.
All nine are charged with,
"disrupting and preventing the effective
carrying out of the speech to be given
by Mr. Lodge," according to Schwartz.
A notice has been circulated by the
administration asking persons present
at the disruption to aid in the

identification of individuals
participating in the disturbance.
Schwartz indicated that, "We received a
significant number of replies both
before and after the request went out."
The replies and information came from
students, faculty, and staff who were
present on Monday.
The students charged face penalties
ranging from reprimand to expulsion.

The University will not appeal a
court ruling that struck down
restrictions against serving liquor in
downtown Palo Alto, the Board of
Trustees decided Tuesday.
This action officially ends the
prohibition imposed 8 0 years ago by
Timothy Hopkins when he sold the

downtown lands. Hopkins placed
anti-liquor restrictions in his deeds
which stated that should liquor ever be
sold or manufactured on the properties,
the land would revert to Stanford
University.
Santa Clara County Superior Court
Judge Peter Anello ruled last month
that the Hopkins restrictions were no
longer valid. He noted that Hopkins
acted to prevent students from
obtaining liquor and stated, "it has
become substantially impossible to
secure the benefits intended by the
original restrictive covenant in the
Hopkins deed."
Because Stanford previously had
approved a liquor license for its Faculty
Club, for a hotel at El Camino Real and
Page Mill Road and in dormitories for
students over 21, Anello said the
University had "waived its right to
enforce the restriction."
