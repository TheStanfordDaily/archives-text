# Ravenswood Boycott Protests School Desegregation Plans
## 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
Chanting, "Hell no, we won't go,"
black students at Ravenswood High
School boycotted classes yesterday in a
protest of School District desegregation
plans.
A large number of students stayed
away from classes, and held a rally
across the street from the school. Later,
they marched through the halls
shouting slogans.
The desegregation plans would
reduce the percentage of black students
at Ravenswood in East Palo Alto from
95 percent to about 25 percent by next
fall. Approximately 85 0 black students
would be bussed to other schools in the
Sequoia Union School District, and
about 72 0 white students would be
bussed to Ravenswood.

The boycott began with a morning
rally of approximately 25 0
Ravenswood students and 7 0
non-student supporters. The rally
moved from the football stadium to the
school gymnasium, ending up in a
vacant lot across from the school after
principal Earl Mereweather was
reported to have called the police to
remove the non-students from the
Ravenswood campus.
Speakers from the Ravenswood and
the Stanford Black Student Unions
addressed the crowd from the back of a
truck. They emphasized the need for
the black community to control its
own schools if black people were to get
decent educations.
"We don't have to go over there to
get a better education," said a speaker
from the Ravenswood BSU, "they can
bring the teachers right over here if
they really want to give us a better
education. We don't have to sit next to
a yellow-hair to get better educated."
School Deteriorated
A member of the BSU pointed out
that the new bussing program will cost
one million dollars in the next year. At
the same time the school itself is
physically deteriorating. There are no
sidewalks in the area, and the street
lighting is poor. They felt that the
money could be better used in
improving the school for the black
students now there than in trying to
achieve "desegregation."
The students felt that the only
reason any improvements were being
made at Ravenswood was in
preparation for the white students
scheduled to enroll next fall under the
desegregation plans. An information
sheet passed out by Nairobi College
showed that, in the year previous to the
decision to desegregate, Ravenswood

received $23,000 , none of which was
spent on physical improvements. In the
two years since the decision
Ravenswood has received $1 72,000,
much of which has been used for
physical improvements (a baseball field,
a new parking lot, and new lighting).
A cafeteria is also planned for next
year, something that black students
have been working for for three years
without success.
Community Control
Willie Newberry, Co-chairman of the
Stanford BSU, spoke about the need
for community control. "They, white
people, are always trying to tell black
people what's best for black people.
Hell, black people know what's best for
black people."
A member of the Ravenswood BSU
commented, "It's time for black people
to get together and take control of our
communities. We know what we need.
We don't need any more white 'experts'
to come down and tell black people
what's wrong."
"We built the school," a black
woman said, "Hell, black slaves built
this whole country. And now they're
trying to take our school away from
us."
Fear of Lost Funds
Last Monday The Real News, put
out by the Stanford BSU and the Third
World Student Union, carried two
articles on the situation at
Ravenswood. Both articles reported
that the principle motive behind the
desegregation plans was the Sequoia
District's fear of loosing federal funds,
if they continued to maintain
Ravenswood in a state of dc facto
segregation.
The Real News also reported that it
was the Stanford communications

department that had drawn up the
plans for desegregation. In addition the
communications department was
reported to have studied the different
ways, legal and illegal that the
community might have opposed the
plans when they were presented.
Both articles concluded that the only
solution was community control of the
school. "The question is who will
control education in the Black
community, the people who live there
or white people who have always
opposed blacks, denied them proper
education and religated them to the
most menial jobs?"
While the principal Mereweather is
black the vice-principal, who is also in
charge of discipline, is white. The
Nairobi leaflet accused the school
board of passing over three qualified
black men when they appointed the
present vice-principal. Mereweather
himself was only appointed after a
student sit-in in the former principal's
office, and he comes from out-of-state.

physical improvements (a baseball field,
a new parking lot, and new lighting).
A cafeteria is also planned for next
year, something that black students
have been working for for three years
without success.
Community Control
Willie Newberry, Co-chairman of the
Stanford BSU, spoke about the need
for community control. "They, white
people, are always trying to tell black
people what's best for black people.
Hell, black people know what's best for
black people."
A member of the Ravenswood BSU
commented, "It's time for black people
to get together and take control of our
communities. We know what we need.
We don't need any more white 'experts'
to come down and tell black people
what's wrong."
"We built the school," a black
woman said, "Hell, black slaves built
this whole country. And now they're
trying to take our school away from
us."
Fear of Lost Funds
Last Monday The Real News, put
out by the Stanford BSU and the Third
World Student Union, carried two
articles on the situation at
Ravenswood. Both articles reported
that the principle motive behind the
desegregation plans was the Sequoia
District's fear of loosing federal funds,
if they continued to maintain
Ravenswood in a state of dc facto
segregation.
The Real News also reported that it
was the Stanford communications

compensation offices.
department that had drawn up the
plans for desegregation. In addition the
communications department was
reported to have studied the different
ways, legal and illegal that the
community might have opposed the
plans when they were presented.
Both articles concluded that the only
solution was community control of the
school. "The question is who will
control education in the Black
community, the people who live there
or white people who have always
opposed blacks, denied them proper
education and religated them to the
most menial jobs?"
While the principal Mereweather is
black the vice-principal, who is also in
charge of discipline, is white. The
Nairobi leaflet accused the school
board of passing over three qualified
black men when they appointed the
present vice-principal. Mereweather
himself was only appointed after a
student sit-in in the former principal's
office, and he comes from out-of-state.

black students at Ravenswood High
School boycotted classes yesterday in a
protest of School District desegregation
plans.
A large number of students stayed
away from classes, and held a rally
across the street from the school. Later,
they marched through the halls
shouting slogans.
The desegregation plans would
reduce the percentage of black students
at Ravenswood in East Palo Alto from
95 percent to about 25 percent by next
fall. Approximately 85 0 black students
would be bussed to other schools in the
Sequoia Union School District, and
about 72 0 white students would be
bussed to Ravenswood.

The boycott began with a morning
rally of approximately 25 0
Ravenswood students and 7 0
non-student supporters. The rally
moved from the football stadium to the
school gymnasium, ending up in a
vacant lot across from the school after
principal Earl Mereweather was
reported to have called the police to
remove the non-students from the
Ravenswood campus.
Speakers from the Ravenswood and
the Stanford Black Student Unions
addressed the crowd from the back of a
truck. They emphasized the need for
the black community to control its
own schools if black people were to get
decent educations.
"We don't have to go over there to
get a better education," said a speaker
from the Ravenswood BSU, "they can
bring the teachers right over here if
they really want to give us a better
education. We don't have to sit next to
a yellow-hair to get better educated."
School Deteriorated
A member of the BSU pointed out
that the new bussing program will cost
one million dollars in the next year. At
the same time the school itself is
physically deteriorating. There are no
sidewalks in the area, and the street
lighting is poor. They felt that the
money could be better used in
improving the school for the black
students now there than in trying to
achieve "desegregation."
The students felt that the only
reason any improvements were being
made at Ravenswood was in
preparation for the white students
scheduled to enroll next fall under the
desegregation plans. An information
sheet passed out by Nairobi College
showed that, in the year previous to the
decision to desegregate, Ravenswood

received $23,000 , none of which was
spent on physical improvements. In the
two years since the decision
Ravenswood has received $1 72,000,
much of which has been used for
physical improvements (a baseball field,
a new parking lot, and new lighting).

A large number of students stayed
away from classes, and held a rally
across the street from the school. Later,
they marched through the halls
shouting slogans.
The desegregation plans would
reduce the percentage of black students
at Ravenswood in East Palo Alto from
95 percent to about 25 percent by next
fall. Approximately 85 0 black students
would be bussed to other schools in the
Sequoia Union School District, and
about 72 0 white students would be
bussed to Ravenswood.

The boycott began with a morning
rally of approximately 25 0
Ravenswood students and 7 0
non-student supporters. The rally
moved from the football stadium to the
school gymnasium, ending up in a
vacant lot across from the school after
principal Earl Mereweather was
reported to have called the police to
remove the non-students from the
Ravenswood campus.
Speakers from the Ravenswood and
the Stanford Black Student Unions
addressed the crowd from the back of a
truck. They emphasized the need for
the black community to control its
own schools if black people were to get
decent educations.
"We don't have to go over there to
get a better education," said a speaker
from the Ravenswood BSU, "they can
bring the teachers right over here if
they really want to give us a better
education. We don't have to sit next to
a yellow-hair to get better educated."
School Deteriorated
A member of the BSU pointed out
that the new bussing program will cost
one million dollars in the next year. At
the same time the school itself is
physically deteriorating. There are no
sidewalks in the area, and the street
lighting is poor. They felt that the
money could be better used in
improving the school for the black
students now there than in trying to
achieve "desegregation."
The students felt that the only
reason any improvements were being
made at Ravenswood was in
preparation for the white students
scheduled to enroll next fall under the
desegregation plans. An information
sheet passed out by Nairobi College
showed that, in the year previous to the
decision to desegregate, Ravenswood

received $23,000 , none of which was
spent on physical improvements. In the
two years since the decision
Ravenswood has received $1 72,000,
much of which has been used for
physical improvements (a baseball field,
a new parking lot, and new lighting).
A cafeteria is also planned for next
year, something that black students
have been working for for three years
without success.
Community Control
Willie Newberry, Co-chairman of the
Stanford BSU, spoke about the need
for community control. "They, white
people, are always trying to tell black
people what's best for black people.
Hell, black people know what's best for
black people."
A member of the Ravenswood BSU
commented, "It's time for black people
to get together and take control of our
communities. We know what we need.
We don't need any more white 'experts'
to come down and tell black people
what's wrong."
"We built the school," a black
woman said, "Hell, black slaves built
this whole country. And now they're
trying to take our school away from
us."
Fear of Lost Funds
Last Monday The Real News, put
out by the Stanford BSU and the Third
World Student Union, carried two
articles on the situation at
Ravenswood. Both articles reported
that the principle motive behind the
desegregation plans was the Sequoia
District's fear of loosing federal funds,
if they continued to maintain
Ravenswood in a state of dc facto
segregation.
The Real News also reported that it
was the Stanford communications

department that had drawn up the
plans for desegregation. In addition the
communications department was
reported to have studied the different
ways, legal and illegal that the
community might have opposed the
plans when they were presented.
Both articles concluded that the only
solution was community control of the
school. "The question is who will
control education in the Black
community, the people who live there
or white people who have always
opposed blacks, denied them proper
education and religated them to the
most menial jobs?"
While the principal Mereweather is
black the vice-principal, who is also in
charge of discipline, is white. The
Nairobi leaflet accused the school
board of passing over three qualified
black men when they appointed the
present vice-principal. Mereweather
himself was only appointed after a
student sit-in in the former principal's
office, and he comes from out-of-state.
