# From Suburbia To Welfare
## Ex-Aerospace Worker Re-Examines Life 
### CHRIS PECK 
Tom O'Neill came to California two
years ago to reap the benefits of the
booming aerospace industry. Now,
once a week he walks to the Santa
Clara county welfare office to reap the
benefits of unemployment
compensation.
There are 10,000 Tom O'Neills in
the Palo Alto area alone. Living in a
$300-a-month home in suburbia and
owning a camper for weekend trips to
Yosemite, these men now constitute
the hard-core unemployed. The
collapse of the skilled labor market in
California is to blame. For the men
involved in the squeeze, the last few
months have been a nightmare.
"I thought it couldn't happen to me
at Hewlett-Packard," said the
39-year-old O'Neill. "When I worked
there, I believed that things were
always going to be better if I just
waited it out. The next thing I knew, I
was waiting it out at home."
For the thousands of highly skilled
technicians now without work, the
outlook for the next few months is
bleak. Local placement agencies are

unable to place ever, a third of these
scientific refugees.
One such agency, Palo Alto
Personnel, admits that "out of any two
dozen aerospace people who come in
during a week, we'll be lucky if we can
place three. For the other seven eighths
of those seeking work, jobs like
pumping gas and selling tires are about
all that are left."
Pumping Gas
The transition from propulsion
expert at Lockheed to gas pumper at
the local Shell station is not an easy
one for many engineers and
technicians. "We still try to keep our
elitist position in the unemployment
lines," laughed O'Neill. "We talk about
the Wall Street Journal, we dress up in
our suits as if we were lunching with an
important executive, and most of all we
look straight ahead, not seeing the
other unemployed workers around us."
Looking straight ahead long enough
will not likely cheer up many of these
unemployed elite. When the
unemployment compensation finally
runs out, they will be forced into
accepting entirely new life styles. "The

realization that one does not have what
it takes to put meat on the table
anymore is the most devestating aspect
to the unemployed aerospace people,"
notes Westley Graves of Shilling and
Shilling Personnel in Palo Alto.
"Most of these men can't get a firm
interested in them in an field outside of
aerospace because, quite frankly, they
don't have what it takes to sell
themselves again after working 10 or 15
years in one industry."
Fed Up With Bullshit
When asked about the future, Tom
O'Neill snaps, "I'm tired of that
Motherhood, sunshine and
'1971-will-be-better bullshit.' I'm fed
up to here with engineering and
technical writing. Engineers are inclined
not to rock the boat about anything,
but if being unemployed has meant
anything to me, it's been that it's
opened my eyes to the great big lie I've
been fed about being an elitist — the
lies about there being plenty of work
around for everybody, the lies about
what kids need is a good kick in the ass
to get them going, the lies about
welfare and food stamps being a waste.
"Hell, I'm 39 and I don't see any
prospects for going back to work, and
I've got a college degree. I think there's
probably a seething agitation among
the unemployed scientists. I don't
think people of my age will go out and
throw stones, but I don't know what
the hell will happen when people are at
the end of their ropes."
Tom O'Neill isn't at the end of his
rope. Yet. He is currently writing an
article for Harper's magazine
concerning the plight of the skilled
unemployed. He is also counting on his
wife's part-time job to bring in some
money. Still, the last few months have
been far from normal for the O'Neill's.
Planter's Party
"I've given up driving my car, I'm
moving out of my house, and I don't
have a telephone," O'Neill notes." And
on my son's fifteenth birthday two
days ago, I gave him a I baked
and a can of Planter's peanuts."

The year of the Planter's peanut
birthday party is one O'Neill and the
thousands like him will long remember.
It is a year that has brought the pain of
economic scarcity out of the ghetto
and into the middle class suburb. For
these devotee to modern America,
unemployment has forced the
re-evaluation of whole lives channeled
in to the American dream.
"In a strange sort of way," said the
tii 11 father of six," these last six months
have been the first time in my life when
I've fell free. I don't want to go back to
that dog eat dog world. In my future, I
quite truthfully hope to be a
blacksmith in some small town."

Looking straight ahead long enough
will not likely cheer up many of these
unemployed elite. When the
unemployment compensation finally
runs out, they will be forced into
accepting entirely new life styles. "The

realization that one does not have what
it takes to put meat on the table
anymore is the most devestating aspect
to the unemployed aerospace people,"
notes Westley Graves of Shilling and
Shilling Personnel in Palo Alto.
"Most of these men can't get a firm
interested in them in an field outside of
aerospace because, quite frankly, they
don't have what it takes to sell
themselves again after working 10 or 15
years in one industry."
Fed Up With Bullshit
When asked about the future, Tom
O'Neill snaps, "I'm tired of that
Motherhood, sunshine and
'1971-will-be-better bullshit.' I'm fed
up to here with engineering and
technical writing. Engineers are inclined
not to rock the boat about anything,
but if being unemployed has meant
anything to me, it's been that it's
opened my eyes to the great big lie I've
been fed about being an elitist — the
lies about there being plenty of work
around for everybody, the lies about
what kids need is a good kick in the ass
to get them going, the lies about
welfare and food stamps being a waste.
"Hell, I'm 39 and I don't see any
prospects for going back to work, and
I've got a college degree. I think there's
probably a seething agitation among
the unemployed scientists. I don't
think people of my age will go out and
throw stones, but I don't know what
the hell will happen when people are at
the end of their ropes."
Tom O'Neill isn't at the end of his
rope. Yet. He is currently writing an
article for Harper's magazine
concerning the plight of the skilled
unemployed. He is also counting on his
wife's part-time job to bring in some
money. Still, the last few months have
been far from normal for the O'Neill's.
Planter's Party
"I've given up driving my car, I'm
moving out of my house, and I don't
have a telephone," O'Neill notes." And
on my son's fifteenth birthday two
days ago, I gave him a I baked
and a can of Planter's peanuts."

The year of the Planter's peanut
birthday party is one O'Neill and the
thousands like him will long remember.
It is a year that has brought the pain of
economic scarcity out of the ghetto
and into the middle class suburb. For
these devotee to modern America,
unemployment has forced the
re-evaluation of whole lives channeled
in to the American dream.
"In a strange sort of way," said the
tii 11 father of six," these last six months
have been the first time in my life when
I've fell free. I don't want to go back to
that dog eat dog world. In my future, I
quite truthfully hope to be a
blacksmith in some small town."
Tom O'Neill came to California two
years ago to reap the benefits of the
booming aerospace industry. Now,
once a week he walks to the Santa
Clara county welfare office to reap the
benefits of unemployment
compensation.
There are 10,000 Tom O'Neills in
the Palo Alto area alone. Living in a
$300-a-month home in suburbia and
owning a camper for weekend trips to
Yosemite, these men now constitute
the hard-core unemployed. The
collapse of the skilled labor market in
California is to blame. For the men
involved in the squeeze, the last few
months have been a nightmare.
"I thought it couldn't happen to me
at Hewlett-Packard," said the
39-year-old O'Neill. "When I worked
there, I believed that things were
always going to be better if I just
waited it out. The next thing I knew, I
was waiting it out at home."
For the thousands of highly skilled
technicians now without work, the
outlook for the next few months is
bleak. Local placement agencies are

unable to place ever, a third of these
scientific refugees.
One such agency, Palo Alto
Personnel, admits that "out of any two
dozen aerospace people who come in
during a week, we'll be lucky if we can
place three. For the other seven eighths
of those seeking work, jobs like
pumping gas and selling tires are about
all that are left."
Pumping Gas
The transition from propulsion
expert at Lockheed to gas pumper at
the local Shell station is not an easy
one for many engineers and
technicians. "We still try to keep our
elitist position in the unemployment
lines," laughed O'Neill. "We talk about
the Wall Street Journal, we dress up in
our suits as if we were lunching with an
important executive, and most of all we
look straight ahead, not seeing the
other unemployed workers around us."

wife's part-time job to bring in some
money. Still, the last few months have
been far from normal for the O'Neill's.
Planter's Party
"I've given up driving my car, I'm
moving out of my house, and I don't
have a telephone," O'Neill notes." And
on my son's fifteenth birthday two
days ago, I gave him a I baked
and a can of Planter's peanuts."

The year of the Planter's peanut
birthday party is one O'Neill and the
thousands like him will long remember.
It is a year that has brought the pain of
economic scarcity out of the ghetto
and into the middle class suburb. For
these devotee to modern America,
unemployment has forced the
re-evaluation of whole lives channeled
in to the American dream.
"In a strange sort of way," said the
tii 11 father of six," these last six months
have been the first time in my life when
I've fell free. I don't want to go back to
that dog eat dog world. In my future, I
quite truthfully hope to be a
blacksmith in some small town."
Tom O'Neill came to California two
years ago to reap the benefits of the
booming aerospace industry. Now,
once a week he walks to the Santa
Clara county welfare office to reap the
benefits of unemployment
compensation.
There are 10,000 Tom O'Neills in
the Palo Alto area alone. Living in a
$300-a-month home in suburbia and
owning a camper for weekend trips to
Yosemite, these men now constitute
the hard-core unemployed. The
collapse of the skilled labor market in
California is to blame. For the men
involved in the squeeze, the last few
months have been a nightmare.
"I thought it couldn't happen to me
at Hewlett-Packard," said the
39-year-old O'Neill. "When I worked
there, I believed that things were
always going to be better if I just
waited it out. The next thing I knew, I
was waiting it out at home."
For the thousands of highly skilled
technicians now without work, the
outlook for the next few months is
bleak. Local placement agencies are

unable to place ever, a third of these
scientific refugees.
One such agency, Palo Alto
Personnel, admits that "out of any two
dozen aerospace people who come in
during a week, we'll be lucky if we can
place three. For the other seven eighths
of those seeking work, jobs like
pumping gas and selling tires are about
all that are left."
Pumping Gas
The transition from propulsion
expert at Lockheed to gas pumper at
the local Shell station is not an easy
one for many engineers and
technicians. "We still try to keep our
elitist position in the unemployment
lines," laughed O'Neill. "We talk about
the Wall Street Journal, we dress up in
our suits as if we were lunching with an
important executive, and most of all we
look straight ahead, not seeing the
other unemployed workers around us."
Looking straight ahead long enough
will not likely cheer up many of these
unemployed elite. When the
unemployment compensation finally
runs out, they will be forced into
accepting entirely new life styles. "The

realization that one does not have what
it takes to put meat on the table
anymore is the most devestating aspect
to the unemployed aerospace people,"
notes Westley Graves of Shilling and
Shilling Personnel in Palo Alto.
"Most of these men can't get a firm
interested in them in an field outside of
aerospace because, quite frankly, they
don't have what it takes to sell
themselves again after working 10 or 15
years in one industry."
Fed Up With Bullshit
When asked about the future, Tom
O'Neill snaps, "I'm tired of that
Motherhood, sunshine and
'1971-will-be-better bullshit.' I'm fed
up to here with engineering and
technical writing. Engineers are inclined
not to rock the boat about anything,
but if being unemployed has meant
anything to me, it's been that it's
opened my eyes to the great big lie I've
been fed about being an elitist — the
lies about there being plenty of work
around for everybody, the lies about
what kids need is a good kick in the ass
to get them going, the lies about
welfare and food stamps being a waste.
"Hell, I'm 39 and I don't see any
prospects for going back to work, and
I've got a college degree. I think there's
probably a seething agitation among
the unemployed scientists. I don't
think people of my age will go out and
throw stones, but I don't know what
the hell will happen when people are at
the end of their ropes."
Tom O'Neill isn't at the end of his
rope. Yet. He is currently writing an
article for Harper's magazine
concerning the plight of the skilled
unemployed. He is also counting on his
wife's part-time job to bring in some
money. Still, the last few months have
been far from normal for the O'Neill's.
