### DAVE STEVENS ROBERT BRUCE 
"There is no serious planning for
peace in the United Nations," said
Kdward Hambro, President of the
General Assembly, last night in remarks
before the concluding session of the
Hoover United Nations Conference.
Calling for the establishment of an
international United Nations university
system, he suggested that such an
institution could go farther to plan for
peace than any of the present
international agencies.
After explaining the few short term
methods of planning for peace, Hambro
spent most of his time detailing plans
for an international university which
might, follow the pattern of multiple
campuses established by the state
university systems of New York and
California.
Included in the dinkelspiel audience
of about 100 was Shirley Temple
Black, a U.S. delegate to the United
Nations. In a question and answer
session alter the speech she quoted a

section of the charter which said that
non-member nations could at tent U.N.
sessions and voice their complaints, and
asked why they don't.

Hambro said, "Yes, why on earth
don't they ..." and basically answered
that he didn't know. He later
complemented Black on her job at the
IJ.N. and for her contributions to
general assembly debates. Speaking
about his proposed university, Hambro
admitted that, "the task is great and
the difficulties formidable." While a
modest start could be made at the
graduate level, lie said, "the ultimate
aim must be a big university which can
cater to the ever growing number of
students who want to enrich themselves
and later to enrich the international
community with their talent and
enthusiasm."

frum major foundations would be
sought to cover the core costs, he

suggested. "The university system
should not be financed by tuition fees,
except if a world wide system of
scholarships makes it sure that poor
students are not excluded."
Between Hambro's address and the
question-and-answer period which
closed the evening, W. Glenn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institution
expressed his appreciation to the U.N.
diplomat for his appearance at
Stanford. In his closing remarks on the
Hoover-sponsored conference Campbell
remarked that, "by your (Hambro's)
presence you have demonstrated that
you will not be intimidated by the kind
of disruptive tactics" that prevented
Ambassador Lodge from delivering his
speech as scheduled at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
He called the disturbances "a
suppression of free speech," and
expressed his view that Lodge was "a
victim of totalitarian outrage." "1 am
encouraged to note," added Campbell,
"that campus opinion was virtually
