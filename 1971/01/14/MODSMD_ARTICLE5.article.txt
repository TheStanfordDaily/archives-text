# a 						question of guilt
## Lodge And Davis 
### 
pierre noyes

Most of us at Stanford must
regret that, whatever his alleged
crimes, Henry Cabot Lodge was
not allowed to address his
audience at the time and place
announced. I trust that if Angela
Davis were to speak here about
her own struggle for peace and
freedom most of us would also
assume her innocent of the crimes
she has been accused of
commiting and grant her a
courteous hearing. Conceivably, it
racist bigots prevented her from
speaking by the same tactics used
to disrupt Mr. Lodge's address,
she would also receive official
apologies from the same sources.
Yet I have an uneasy feeling
that even if Miss Davis were free on
bail, she would not receive an
invitation to make use of this
neutral forum to present her
views. If you share that unease
with me, perhaps you will join me
in reflecting on the cause. Our
reluctance to invite her could not
be based on the feeling that in her
case the prima facie evidence for
her guilt is so clear as to make
unrealistic the customary

presumption of innocence;
otherwise, there would have been
even stronger grounds to refuse to
invite Mr. Lodge to speak here.
In the case of Miss Davis, the
usual presumption of innocence is
reinforced in a number of ways.
We know from press accounts that
various authorities are
manufacturing cases against Black
Panthers and other
revolutionaries. Two Panthers
were murdered in their beds in
Chicago, purportedly in response
to a hail of bullets; yet when the
physical evidence was examined,
it became clear that the hail of
bullets came exclusively from the
police's own guns. An agent
provocateur who infiltrated a
group in Seattle was stupid
enough to admit that he would go
to any lengths to get that group
convicted of conspiracy, thus
blowing the legal case against
them sky high. In the case at
hand, Miss Davis' codefendant
claims that he has been offered
immunity if he will manufacture
evidence against her. Even the
concept of conspiracy as a crime

suffers for proof.
In contrast, the factual and
legal case which has already been
made against Mr. Lodge is much
stronger. We read daily in reports
from the My Lai court martial
that the slaughter which everyone
agrees occurred there was not only
committed under orders, but was
in fact an example of standard
operating procedure in the free
fire zones of Vietnam. As sworn
testimony in a military court, this
rests on a very different basis than
simple newspaper allegations. Not
that the newspaper allegations are
lacking. A book of them,
catalogued according to which law
or laws of war had apparently
been violated was prepared for
1 965, 1 966, and the first half of
1967 by Seymour Melman (In the
Name of America). Even the
existence of declared "free fire
zones," which the military talk of
freely, is in itself undoubtedly a
war crime of the most serious
kind.
The legal situation is also
hardly subject to question. One
need only look back to the San
Francisco Chronicle of January 9,
197 0 to learn that Tedford
Taylor, the prosecutor at
Nuremberg, believes that our
civilian and military leaders could
be convicted on the basis of those
precedents. Recall that the trials
were set up precisely so that no
future prosecutor would have to
face the argument that there was
no precedent for the enforcement
of extant international law. Two
examples will suffice. Generals
who Hooded crop land in Holland
with sea water were executed
under laws of warfare that had
existed for centuries. Some of our

generals in Vietnam boast of
denying food to whole regions by
defoliation, and the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science team found that at
least 12 percent of the crop land
of South Vietnam has been
destroyed. General Yamoshita was
convicted and hung because he
did not enforce discipline on his
troops in such a way that
atrocities would not be
committed, even though he had
no personal knowledge of such
acts. His sentence was reviewed
and upheld by the United States
Supreme Court. Clearly, setting
policies aimed at the destruction
of civilians is an even greater
crime. In both instances civilian
leaders responsible for initiating
and conducting aggressive war
along these lines were also
convicted and executed. As
Supreme Court Justice Jackson
remarked at the time"... if certain
acts in violation of treaties are
crimes, they are crimes whether
the United States does them or
Germany does them, and we are
not prepared to lay down a rule of
criminal conduct against others
which we would not be willing to
have invoked against us."
1 join those who regret that Mr.
Lodge's rights to present his views
were not respected, and urge all of
us to strive harder for the
impartiality needed to prevent
similar episodes in the future. I
would, however, feel easier about
granting him the presumption of
innocence if I were convinced that
he would have an opportunity to
defend that innocence in court, in
as fair a trial as we can expect for
Miss Davis. (Pierre Noyes is a

police's own guns. An agent
provocateur who infiltrated a
group in Seattle was stupid
enough to admit that he would go
to any lengths to get that group
convicted of conspiracy, thus
blowing the legal case against
them sky high. In the case at
hand, Miss Davis' codefendant
claims that he has been offered
immunity if he will manufacture
evidence against her. Even the
concept of conspiracy as a crime

suffers for proof.
In contrast, the factual and
legal case which has already been
made against Mr. Lodge is much
stronger. We read daily in reports
from the My Lai court martial
that the slaughter which everyone
agrees occurred there was not only
committed under orders, but was
in fact an example of standard
operating procedure in the free
fire zones of Vietnam. As sworn
testimony in a military court, this
rests on a very different basis than
simple newspaper allegations. Not
that the newspaper allegations are
lacking. A book of them,
catalogued according to which law
or laws of war had apparently
been violated was prepared for
1 965, 1 966, and the first half of
1967 by Seymour Melman (In the
Name of America). Even the
existence of declared "free fire
zones," which the military talk of
freely, is in itself undoubtedly a
war crime of the most serious
kind.
The legal situation is also
hardly subject to question. One
need only look back to the San
Francisco Chronicle of January 9,
197 0 to learn that Tedford
Taylor, the prosecutor at
Nuremberg, believes that our
civilian and military leaders could
be convicted on the basis of those
precedents. Recall that the trials
were set up precisely so that no
future prosecutor would have to
face the argument that there was
no precedent for the enforcement
of extant international law. Two
examples will suffice. Generals
who Hooded crop land in Holland
with sea water were executed
under laws of warfare that had
existed for centuries. Some of our

generals in Vietnam boast of
denying food to whole regions by
defoliation, and the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science team found that at
least 12 percent of the crop land
of South Vietnam has been
destroyed. General Yamoshita was
convicted and hung because he
did not enforce discipline on his
troops in such a way that
atrocities would not be
committed, even though he had
no personal knowledge of such
acts. His sentence was reviewed
and upheld by the United States
Supreme Court. Clearly, setting
policies aimed at the destruction
of civilians is an even greater
crime. In both instances civilian
leaders responsible for initiating
and conducting aggressive war
along these lines were also
convicted and executed. As
Supreme Court Justice Jackson
remarked at the time"... if certain
acts in violation of treaties are
crimes, they are crimes whether
the United States does them or
Germany does them, and we are
not prepared to lay down a rule of
criminal conduct against others
which we would not be willing to
have invoked against us."

Lodge's rights to present his views
were not respected, and urge all of
us to strive harder for the
impartiality needed to prevent
similar episodes in the future. I
would, however, feel easier about
granting him the presumption of
innocence if I were convinced that
he would have an opportunity to
defend that innocence in court, in
as fair a trial as we can expect for
Miss Davis. (Pierre Noyes is a

Most of us at Stanford must
regret that, whatever his alleged
crimes, Henry Cabot Lodge was
not allowed to address his
audience at the time and place
announced. I trust that if Angela
Davis were to speak here about
her own struggle for peace and
freedom most of us would also
assume her innocent of the crimes
she has been accused of
commiting and grant her a
courteous hearing. Conceivably, it
racist bigots prevented her from
speaking by the same tactics used
to disrupt Mr. Lodge's address,
she would also receive official
apologies from the same sources.
Yet I have an uneasy feeling
that even if Miss Davis were free on
bail, she would not receive an
invitation to make use of this
neutral forum to present her
views. If you share that unease
with me, perhaps you will join me
in reflecting on the cause. Our
reluctance to invite her could not
be based on the feeling that in her
case the prima facie evidence for
her guilt is so clear as to make
unrealistic the customary

presumption of innocence;
otherwise, there would have been
even stronger grounds to refuse to
invite Mr. Lodge to speak here.
In the case of Miss Davis, the
usual presumption of innocence is
reinforced in a number of ways.
We know from press accounts that
various authorities are
manufacturing cases against Black
Panthers and other
revolutionaries. Two Panthers
were murdered in their beds in
Chicago, purportedly in response
to a hail of bullets; yet when the
physical evidence was examined,
it became clear that the hail of
bullets came exclusively from the
police's own guns. An agent
provocateur who infiltrated a
group in Seattle was stupid
enough to admit that he would go
to any lengths to get that group
convicted of conspiracy, thus

civilian and military leaders could
be convicted on the basis of those
precedents. Recall that the trials
were set up precisely so that no
future prosecutor would have to
face the argument that there was
no precedent for the enforcement
of extant international law. Two
examples will suffice. Generals
who Hooded crop land in Holland
with sea water were executed
under laws of warfare that had
existed for centuries. Some of our

generals in Vietnam boast of
denying food to whole regions by
defoliation, and the American
Association for the Advancement
of Science team found that at
least 12 percent of the crop land
of South Vietnam has been
destroyed. General Yamoshita was
convicted and hung because he
did not enforce discipline on his
troops in such a way that
atrocities would not be
committed, even though he had
no personal knowledge of such
acts. His sentence was reviewed
and upheld by the United States
Supreme Court. Clearly, setting
policies aimed at the destruction
of civilians is an even greater
crime. In both instances civilian
leaders responsible for initiating
and conducting aggressive war
along these lines were also
convicted and executed. As
Supreme Court Justice Jackson
remarked at the time"... if certain
acts in violation of treaties are
crimes, they are crimes whether
the United States does them or
Germany does them, and we are
not prepared to lay down a rule of
criminal conduct against others
which we would not be willing to
have invoked against us."

Most of us at Stanford must
regret that, whatever his alleged
crimes, Henry Cabot Lodge was
not allowed to address his
audience at the time and place
announced. I trust that if Angela
Davis were to speak here about
her own struggle for peace and
freedom most of us would also
assume her innocent of the crimes
she has been accused of
commiting and grant her a
courteous hearing. Conceivably, it
racist bigots prevented her from
speaking by the same tactics used
to disrupt Mr. Lodge's address,
she would also receive official
apologies from the same sources.
Yet I have an uneasy feeling
that even if Miss Davis were free on
bail, she would not receive an
invitation to make use of this
neutral forum to present her
views. If you share that unease
with me, perhaps you will join me
in reflecting on the cause. Our
reluctance to invite her could not
be based on the feeling that in her
case the prima facie evidence for
her guilt is so clear as to make
unrealistic the customary

presumption of innocence;
otherwise, there would have been
even stronger grounds to refuse to
invite Mr. Lodge to speak here.
In the case of Miss Davis, the
usual presumption of innocence is
reinforced in a number of ways.
We know from press accounts that
various authorities are
manufacturing cases against Black
Panthers and other
revolutionaries. Two Panthers
were murdered in their beds in
Chicago, purportedly in response
to a hail of bullets; yet when the
physical evidence was examined,
it became clear that the hail of
bullets came exclusively from the
police's own guns. An agent
provocateur who infiltrated a
group in Seattle was stupid
enough to admit that he would go
to any lengths to get that group
convicted of conspiracy, thus
blowing the legal case against
them sky high. In the case at
hand, Miss Davis' codefendant
claims that he has been offered
immunity if he will manufacture
evidence against her. Even the
concept of conspiracy as a crime

suffers for proof.
In contrast, the factual and
legal case which has already been
made against Mr. Lodge is much
stronger. We read daily in reports
from the My Lai court martial
that the slaughter which everyone
agrees occurred there was not only
committed under orders, but was
in fact an example of standard
operating procedure in the free
fire zones of Vietnam. As sworn
testimony in a military court, this
rests on a very different basis than
simple newspaper allegations. Not
that the newspaper allegations are
lacking. A book of them,
catalogued according to which law
or laws of war had apparently
been violated was prepared for
1 965, 1 966, and the first half of
1967 by Seymour Melman (In the
Name of America). Even the
existence of declared "free fire
zones," which the military talk of
freely, is in itself undoubtedly a
war crime of the most serious
kind.
The legal situation is also
hardly subject to question. One
need only look back to the San
Francisco Chronicle of January 9,
197 0 to learn that Tedford
Taylor, the prosecutor at
Nuremberg, believes that our
civilian and military leaders could
be convicted on the basis of those
precedents. Recall that the trials
were set up precisely so that no
future prosecutor would have to
face the argument that there was
no precedent for the enforcement
of extant international law. Two
examples will suffice. Generals
