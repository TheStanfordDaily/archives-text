It was a surprise to no one that
hecklers confronted the speaker
last Monday at Dinkelspiel.
Shortly after the now famous
"Are you people afraid to let us
hear what he has to say?", Mr.
Campbell summarily "cancelled"
the meeting. This was done
despite Mr. Lodge's apparent
willingness, both in words and
action, to continue, and the desire
of the majority of the audience
for him to do so. A hypothetical
advocate of the far right would
consider himself successful
indeed, had he been able to

engineer the results which Mr.
Campbell, regardless of his
motives, if any, brought about.
A university with Stanford's
resources and enlightenment
should have both a plan for
handling such easily foreseen
occurrences and a guy in control
with enough cool to implement it.
If not, it shares complicity.
If the Reichstag burns it is
prudent to consider the causes.

Editor, THE DAILY:
During last Spring's protests the
ROTC was a prime target.
Opponents felt that the University
should not sanction Stanford's
involvement with the Military
Establishment. It was argued that
any student who was interested in
ROTC could participate in a
program of this kind offered by
an agency not located on the
campus. Critics asserted that by
allowing the ROTC program the
University gave tacit approval to it
and to United States military
policy, specifically in Vietnam. As
a result of these arguments and
the violence of last Spring, the
University has agreed to phase out
ROTC studies on the campus.
Undoubtedly, United States
military policy is one of the
foremost moral questions on
campus today.
In light of the University's past
attitude, it was with great
curiosity that I read the article in
Thursday's Daily concerning the
"new abortion counselling
center." For many people, the
issue of legalized abortion is a
major moral dilemma. For some
people (e.g., practicing Catholics),
a fetus is considered to be a
functioning human being right
from the moment of conception.
To these persons abortion is

murder, just as by many others
the war in East Asia is deemed a
"murderous imperialistic
adventure." In the same manner
that the war may be considered
beneficial to some segments of the
populace, doesn't abortion
simplify the problems of a couple
who has been negligent in the use
of proper birth control procedures
and thus can be considered
"profitable" for them? It must be
noted that few co-eds at Stanford
are victims of rape, incest or
rubella.
Abortion is a personal issue
that a woman's own conscience
must decide upon. Isn't the
University taking a moral stand by
sanctioning the presence of PPIC
on the campus? Once again it can
be argued that when an issue is a
matter of individual conscience,
the University should remain a
neutral agent. If a woman decides
that she wants an abortion, she
should be able to seek the aid of
an off-campus facility that will
help her. in much the same way as
a student who wishes to receive
ROTC training now must.
It may be argued that society
outside the University's walls is 20
years behind the times and that a
girl would be hard-pressed to find
abortion counselling in Palo Alto.
On the other hand, one sees few,
if any, ROTC centers along El
Camino Real. In fact, the army is
probably 2 0 years behind the
times and a few lieutenants
exposed to liberal campus
attitudes could do the service no
harm. The PPIC could certainly
move off campus land, where it
would no longer be supported by
direct Stanford funding and still
provide services.

I would like to thank the

Stanford Fire Department and the
Santa Clara County Sheriff for
not disturbing my piano practice
yesterday at 1:30 p.m. when they
emptied Dinkelspiel Auditorium
in response to a bomb threat. It
was most considerate of them,
and I am sure that I speak for the
other dozen or so people who
were allowed to continue their
work, blissfully unaware that they
might at any moment have their
heads blown off.

The Stanford Daily of January
1 2 had two pictures on its front
page. One showed Mr. Lodge,
vainly trying to give the speech
which he had been invited to offer
on our campus.
The other picture showed a
young man who had risen from
his seat in the audience to face a
small group of snarling paranoids
with the question, "Are you
afraid to let us hear what he has
to say?"
A few moments later, the
session was ended; those foul
bullies had won their goal: "Shut
it down."
All but a handful of that large
audience had come to hear a
message from the guest on our
campus. We might have agreed
with his message wholly, or
partly, or not at all. Be that as it
may, I suspect that most of us
would not long remember what he
said.
But one thing I shall never
forget so long as I live: the cool
courage and earnestness of that
young man as he threw his
challenge to the storm troopers.
For me it was the most
memorable moment I have
experienced for some years.

The Stanford Daily of January
1 2 had two pictures on its front
page. One showed Mr. Lodge,
vainly trying to give the speech
which he had been invited to offer
on our campus.
The other picture showed a
young man who had risen from
his seat in the audience to face a
small group of snarling paranoids
with the question, "Are you
afraid to let us hear what he has
to say?"
A few moments later, the
session was ended; those foul
bullies had won their goal: "Shut
it down."
All but a handful of that large
audience had come to hear a
message from the guest on our
campus. We might have agreed
with his message wholly, or
partly, or not at all. Be that as it
may, I suspect that most of us
would not long remember what he
said.
But one thing I shall never
forget so long as I live: the cool
courage and earnestness of that
young man as he threw his
challenge to the storm troopers.
For me it was the most
memorable moment I have
experienced for some years.

It was a surprise to no one that
hecklers confronted the speaker
last Monday at Dinkelspiel.
Shortly after the now famous
"Are you people afraid to let us
hear what he has to say?", Mr.
Campbell summarily "cancelled"
the meeting. This was done
despite Mr. Lodge's apparent
willingness, both in words and
action, to continue, and the desire
of the majority of the audience
for him to do so. A hypothetical
advocate of the far right would
consider himself successful
indeed, had he been able to

engineer the results which Mr.
Campbell, regardless of his
motives, if any, brought about.
A university with Stanford's
resources and enlightenment
should have both a plan for
handling such easily foreseen
occurrences and a guy in control
with enough cool to implement it.
If not, it shares complicity.
If the Reichstag burns it is
prudent to consider the causes.

Editor, THE DAILY:
During last Spring's protests the
ROTC was a prime target.
Opponents felt that the University
should not sanction Stanford's
involvement with the Military
Establishment. It was argued that
any student who was interested in
ROTC could participate in a
program of this kind offered by
an agency not located on the
campus. Critics asserted that by
allowing the ROTC program the
University gave tacit approval to it
and to United States military
policy, specifically in Vietnam. As
a result of these arguments and
the violence of last Spring, the
University has agreed to phase out
ROTC studies on the campus.
Undoubtedly, United States
military policy is one of the
foremost moral questions on
campus today.
In light of the University's past
attitude, it was with great
curiosity that I read the article in
Thursday's Daily concerning the
"new abortion counselling
center." For many people, the
issue of legalized abortion is a
major moral dilemma. For some
people (e.g., practicing Catholics),
a fetus is considered to be a
functioning human being right
from the moment of conception.
To these persons abortion is

murder, just as by many others
the war in East Asia is deemed a
"murderous imperialistic
adventure." In the same manner
that the war may be considered
beneficial to some segments of the
populace, doesn't abortion
simplify the problems of a couple
who has been negligent in the use
of proper birth control procedures
and thus can be considered
"profitable" for them? It must be
noted that few co-eds at Stanford
are victims of rape, incest or
rubella.
Abortion is a personal issue
that a woman's own conscience
must decide upon. Isn't the
University taking a moral stand by
sanctioning the presence of PPIC
on the campus? Once again it can
be argued that when an issue is a
matter of individual conscience,
the University should remain a
neutral agent. If a woman decides
that she wants an abortion, she
should be able to seek the aid of
an off-campus facility that will
help her. in much the same way as
a student who wishes to receive
ROTC training now must.
It may be argued that society
outside the University's walls is 20
years behind the times and that a
girl would be hard-pressed to find
abortion counselling in Palo Alto.
On the other hand, one sees few,
if any, ROTC centers along El
Camino Real. In fact, the army is
probably 2 0 years behind the
times and a few lieutenants
exposed to liberal campus
attitudes could do the service no
harm. The PPIC could certainly
move off campus land, where it
would no longer be supported by
direct Stanford funding and still
provide services.

should be able to seek the aid of
an off-campus facility that will
help her. in much the same way as
a student who wishes to receive
ROTC training now must.
It may be argued that society
outside the University's walls is 20
years behind the times and that a
girl would be hard-pressed to find
abortion counselling in Palo Alto.
On the other hand, one sees few,
if any, ROTC centers along El
Camino Real. In fact, the army is
probably 2 0 years behind the
times and a few lieutenants
exposed to liberal campus
attitudes could do the service no
harm. The PPIC could certainly
move off campus land, where it
would no longer be supported by
direct Stanford funding and still
provide services.

I would like to thank the

Stanford Fire Department and the
Santa Clara County Sheriff for
not disturbing my piano practice
yesterday at 1:30 p.m. when they
emptied Dinkelspiel Auditorium
in response to a bomb threat. It
was most considerate of them,
and I am sure that I speak for the
other dozen or so people who
were allowed to continue their
work, blissfully unaware that they
might at any moment have their
heads blown off.

The Stanford Daily of January
1 2 had two pictures on its front
page. One showed Mr. Lodge,
vainly trying to give the speech
which he had been invited to offer
on our campus.
The other picture showed a
young man who had risen from
his seat in the audience to face a
small group of snarling paranoids
with the question, "Are you
afraid to let us hear what he has
to say?"
A few moments later, the
session was ended; those foul
bullies had won their goal: "Shut
it down."
All but a handful of that large
audience had come to hear a
message from the guest on our
campus. We might have agreed
with his message wholly, or
partly, or not at all. Be that as it
may, I suspect that most of us
would not long remember what he
said.
But one thing I shall never
forget so long as I live: the cool
courage and earnestness of that
young man as he threw his
challenge to the storm troopers.
For me it was the most
memorable moment I have
experienced for some years.

It was a surprise to no one that
hecklers confronted the speaker
last Monday at Dinkelspiel.
Shortly after the now famous
"Are you people afraid to let us
hear what he has to say?", Mr.
Campbell summarily "cancelled"
the meeting. This was done
despite Mr. Lodge's apparent
willingness, both in words and
action, to continue, and the desire
of the majority of the audience
for him to do so. A hypothetical
advocate of the far right would
consider himself successful
indeed, had he been able to

engineer the results which Mr.
Campbell, regardless of his
motives, if any, brought about.
A university with Stanford's
resources and enlightenment
should have both a plan for
handling such easily foreseen
occurrences and a guy in control
with enough cool to implement it.
If not, it shares complicity.
If the Reichstag burns it is
prudent to consider the causes.

Editor, THE DAILY:
During last Spring's protests the
ROTC was a prime target.
Opponents felt that the University
should not sanction Stanford's
involvement with the Military
Establishment. It was argued that
any student who was interested in
ROTC could participate in a
program of this kind offered by
an agency not located on the
campus. Critics asserted that by
allowing the ROTC program the
University gave tacit approval to it
and to United States military
policy, specifically in Vietnam. As
a result of these arguments and
the violence of last Spring, the
University has agreed to phase out
ROTC studies on the campus.
Undoubtedly, United States
military policy is one of the
foremost moral questions on
campus today.
In light of the University's past
attitude, it was with great
curiosity that I read the article in
Thursday's Daily concerning the
"new abortion counselling
center." For many people, the
issue of legalized abortion is a
major moral dilemma. For some
people (e.g., practicing Catholics),
a fetus is considered to be a
functioning human being right
from the moment of conception.
To these persons abortion is

murder, just as by many others
the war in East Asia is deemed a
"murderous imperialistic
adventure." In the same manner
that the war may be considered
beneficial to some segments of the
populace, doesn't abortion
simplify the problems of a couple
who has been negligent in the use
of proper birth control procedures
and thus can be considered
"profitable" for them? It must be
noted that few co-eds at Stanford
are victims of rape, incest or
rubella.
Abortion is a personal issue
that a woman's own conscience
must decide upon. Isn't the
University taking a moral stand by
sanctioning the presence of PPIC
on the campus? Once again it can
be argued that when an issue is a
matter of individual conscience,
the University should remain a
neutral agent. If a woman decides
that she wants an abortion, she
should be able to seek the aid of
an off-campus facility that will
help her. in much the same way as
a student who wishes to receive
