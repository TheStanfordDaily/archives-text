# Puckers Lead League

### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford Hockey team
defeated San Francisco 9 -6,
Tuesday night, and moved into
sole possession of first place in the
Bay Area Senior Hockey League.
In their finest effort of the
year, the Indians stayed close all
the way and finally overtook the
strong San Francisco club in the
last period.
The Cards fell behind 1 -0 early
in the game, but Rich Jaros scored
a goal while the Indians were
shorthanded to tie it up. The
visitors tallied again with seven
seconds left in the period to take
a 2-1 first period lead.
Pattern Continues
The pattern of the visitors
going ahead and Stanford tying it
up, only to fall behind again,
continued into third period.

But with a little less than nine
minutes to go, Stanford made
their move.
With the Indians trailing 6-5,
player-coach Pat Baldwin came up
with an unbelievable hat trick,
scoring three goals within the
space of 48 seconds. One of the
scores came on a rebound, while
the others came on blasts from
thirty feet out. Stanford scored
one final goal to lock up the 9 -6
win.
Last Saturday, as part of the
Winter Carnival held at Squaw
Valley, the Indian puckers
defeated Cal 5-4. After falling
behind 2-0 in the early going,
Stanford came up with two scores
for a 2-2 tie at the end of one
period.
Tie Game
In the second period Will

McLivaine got his second goal and
assisted on another to push
Stanford ahead 4-2. But the Bears
tied it up 4-4 in the third period.
Finally Pat Baldwin hit McLivaine
in front of the Cal goal and
McLivaine pushed in the winning
goal, his third of the night. It was
the second hat trick of the year
for McLivaine, who has
apparently fully recovered from a
head injury which was supposed
to have ended his career.
The game was well attended by
over 900 fans, giving hope for an
increased audience for future
Stanford hockey games. The
Indians, now 6-3 on the year,
travel to Stockton this Sunday
and return to face Belmont on
Tuesday. The game with Belmont
will be played at the Belmont
Iceland and admission is free.

apparently fully recovered from a
head injury which was supposed
to have ended his career.
The game was well attended by
over 900 fans, giving hope for an
increased audience for future
Stanford hockey games. The
Indians, now 6-3 on the year,
travel to Stockton this Sunday
and return to face Belmont on
Tuesday. The game with Belmont
will be played at the Belmont
Iceland and admission is free.
