# New Rugby Season
## 
### 
Stanford's defending national
championship rugby team opens
their season this Saturday when
they host the San Francisco
Rugby Club at 1:30 p.m. Last
year the Indians had a 13-1 record
and for the third straight year,
won the Monterey Rugby
Tournament, which carried with it
the un-official No. 1 national
ranking.
Gone from last year's team are
such veterans as Leon
Hartvickson, Joe Neal, Chuck
Williams and Jack Lasater. But
Coach Pete Kmetovic feels he has
a fine nucleus returning and is
optimistic at the chances for
another national crown.
A number of players off

Stanford's victorious Rose Bowl
team will play an important part
on the team. Bill Alexander, Wade
Killefer, and Ron Kadziel will be
in the scrum and Don Bunce, Eric
Cross, Reggie Sanderson and Jack
Schultz will all see action in the
backfield.
Also returning from last year's
team are fullback Stewart Wilson,
backs Kip Oxman and Jim Squeri
and hooker Bill Buckland. Wilson
is a former member of the British
Lions, Great Britain's National
Team.
Following the varsity game, the
Stanford seconds will play the San
Francisco seconds at 3:00 p.m.
Last weekend the seconds opened
their season with a 43-6 win over
the Monterey Club.

WHERE'S THE BALL?â€”The ball is nowhere in sight, but the action
continues in a rugby game last year. Jim Plunkett's probable
successor, Don Bunce, is seen being manhandled by some unidentified
opponents. Bunce and the rest of the Stanford Rugby Team open
their season this Saturday against San Francisco.
