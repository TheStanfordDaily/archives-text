VERDOUX
James Agee on MONSIEUR VERDOUX:
"I can only hope that I may faintly suggest the
frame-by-frame appreciation, the gratitude, and the
tribute which we owe this great poet and his great
poem. I love and revere this film as deeply as any I
have ever seen, and I believe it is among the great
works of this century.
