# Summer Jobs To Be Rare In '71
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
"I think this summer it will be hard
for a student to get a job anywhere.
Maybe the summer after this one will
be better, but for students looking for
work in June, there's nothing."
This gloomy preduction for summer
jobs in 1971 comes from Ellen Boozer,
coordinator of the Stanlord
Student-Alumni Summer Employment
Program. It reflects the widespread
collapse of the youth job market in the
United States.
The unemployment level for
students entering the job market in the
spring or summer will reach a
devastating level of 25% according to
the National Committee on
Employment of Youth. For Stanford
students, the rate of unemployment
could be even higher.
Ralph Keller, Director of the
Stanford Placement Service described
his center's ability to place students on
summer jobs as "a situation much
better than most larger universtiies,"
but admitted that "the summer job
situation appears to be tighter this
coming year than it was last year."
Market Shrivelling
To be tighter than last year, the local
market would have to shrivel up almost
completely. Unfortunately, that could
be the size of the pool of available jobs in
Palo Alto according to local temporary

employment agencies. "In normal
years," recalled Jan Becker of Kelly
Services, "when it comes time to give
employees vacations, we'd get calls
from employers for students to fill in
for a month or so. But now, I think
people will double up to take up that
slack."
Even companies tha ( usually have a
prescribed number of summer openings
for Stanford students are no longer
providing jobs. "IBM and
Hewlett-Packard, the two biggest
part-time employers for Stanford
students," noted the director of the
Placement Center's temporary
employment division, Carol P'riedman,
"have cancelled their summer
employment programs altogether."
The number of possible openings for
summer employment listed in the
Placement Center is less than half of
the number of positions listed last year.
Last year the possible openings totalled
38 6, this summer's total is less than
150.
Nationwide Squeeze
In addition to the tight conditions
already existing in Palo Alto, the
nationwide squeeze will probably
attract thousands of out-of-state
students to California who will be
looking for employment. Jillian
Jackson of the Olsten Services

placement service predicted that, "they
will come in droves this summer. I'll
probably get 2 0 a day looking for
work."
Since the local job market will be so
clogged with applicants, the Placement
Center, the Student-Alumni Summer
Job Program, and the local temporary
help agencies are advising students to
get out of traditional channels in their
search for employment.
"It is unrealistic for these students to
think they can get jobs in the Palo Alto
area," warned Becker. "Even in other
markets, students workers may have to
fall back on the shoulder of a father or
a friend-of-a-father to get a job."
"It is more likely students will get a
job this summer because they know
somebody rather than because they
know something," Placement Director
Keller wryly predicted. "The
importance of having connections with
somebody will be more important than
our office for this summer."
Ingenuity
A second, more noble but less
reliable method for gaining summer
jobs will be the ability of students to
fall back on their own ingenuity. "The
most successful summer jobs this year
as last," said Miss Friendland, "will be
those where students start their own
enterprises." Nurseries, catering of
parties, and various crafts were among

the ventures most likely to be
successful she said.
A number of groups on the Stanford
campus have begun to come to the aid
of the unemployed student. Most
important of these groups is the newly
formed Student-Alumni Summer
Employment Program that has been
organized by the Stanford Alumni
Association.
"The idea is to get well-known
alumni businessmen around the
country to act as back-up men of
Stanford students looking for work in
various parts of the country,"
explained the program's director, Ellen
Boozer. "Hopefully, when the program
is firmly established in the summer of
1 972, a student can go to some area
and contact an alumni businessman for
help in finding work."
In addition to this program, the
Placement Center has begun an
aggressive new program for securing
summer jobs for more students. "We've
got to get out of the babysitting and
housecleaning business," declared
Director Keller, "because it doesn't pay
enough and there aren't nearly enough
openings."
These efforts will not offset the
gloom of 1971 however, and for many
Stanford students, a summer of suntan
and television seem to be inevitable.

RUNNING BLlNDâ€”Students all over the country are soon going to have to open
their eyes to the severe shortage of summer jobs expected for 1971. Spokesmen
for the Placement Center here say that the number of possible summer jobs in the
area is half of what it was a year ago. Things may be better in '7 2, but don't count
on it.
