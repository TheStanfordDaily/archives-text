Editor, The DAILY:
With regards to the
Ravenswood boycott supported
by the BSU of Stanford and
Ravenswood, it seems that the
long term benefits of the
Ravenswood Community would
be best met through
implimentation of the
desegregation plans. In this
context, much is being said about
the importance of "quality
education," in which newer
books, good teachers, and new
cafeterias are not the complete
answer to a child's education.
Part of this education must
include an understanding and
awareness of other peoples' ideas,
beliefs, characteristics, and
problems, so that bigotry on both
sides can be reduced. Statements
like "We don't need any more
white 'experts' to come down and
tell black people what's wrong."

and ".. . . and now They're trying
to take our schools away," sound
so similar (with a few color
changes) to what can be heard in
white areas, and they aren't very
constructive.
Anyway, a major force in
developing the desegregation plans
was Dr. Clyde Deßerry, a black
educator, there have been many
black students and parents who
have spoken out in favor of the
desegregation plans, and the
deciding vote cast on the Sequoia
Union School Board was cast by
another black educator. Having a
black school, in a black area, run
by blacks will inevitably result in
more discrimination and more
frustration for the blacks in the
community as a whole. But, of
course, it might just take a few
more years and the blacks will be
really an angry, and with power
and glory the BSU can lead a
black assault. "Kill White!"
"Black Power!" Terrific.
With such complicated

problems as black-white relations
and education, no plan is going to
be without some inadequacies for
some segment of the black
community. Hopefully, the
majority of blacks will benefit
from school desegregation and
this is what the BSU should be
interested in.

Editor, The DAILY:
I am sorry that in the general
expression of outrage, both on
and off campus, against those who
disrupted Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech, there has been so little
attention given to the reason for
the offenders' anger.
It doesn't take more than a
reading of the daily newspapers to
know that U.S. policies in
Indochina have produced
atrocities of a quality, if not a

quantity, equal to anything the
Nazis ever devised. The slaughter
of villagers by machine gun fire
and burning gasoline jelly; the use
of fragmentation bombs that
splatter flesh-tearing darts over
wide areas; the systematic use of
torture; barbarously cruel prison
camps; starvation of entire
populations by defoliation of
croplands—these are the
generalities.
The specifics of our actions
make far more gruesome reading.
Perhaps we most resemble the
Nazis in our official policy of
turning human beings into
ciphers, of tearing them from
their roots and denying their very
humanity. We call this policy by
various names, such as
"urbanization" or even
"pacification," and then proceed
to ship—under terrifying
con d i tions—hundreds of
thousands of people from one
place to another as if they were
cattle.
As a major participant in the
development and execution of
these policies Henry Cabot Lodge
is indeed a criminal. Shouting
slogans and preventing him from

speaking were self-defeating acts
which made a martyr of Lodge
and showed contempt for the
University. Hut I am ashamed that
the rest of us didn't indicate in
some more appropriate way that
Lodge was something less than an
honored guest here.
1 agree wholeheartedly that it is
frightening when freedom to
speak, or to listen to a particular
speaker, is threatened—anywhere.
But to me it is equally frightening
that so many of us are able to
turn a blind eye to acts, and to
the perpetrators of these acts,
which should horrify us.

condemned
Dear EDITOR:
Henry Cabot Lodge was
assumed guilty and condemned to
silence by some fellow
citizens. Many of those not so
well informed as the executioners
were puzzled at the severity of the
punishment. No one was allowed
to question the jury.
