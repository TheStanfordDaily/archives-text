# ACT 'Heterosexual' Clever Comedy
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Oh, where are the snows of
yesteryear? How much more
painful it will be to sit in front of
the boob tube, watching nuns
collide with skyscrapers, now that
I have seen a play by Paddy
Chayefsky and have a glimmer of
what television could have been.
Mr. Chayefsky, as I am sure most
of you know, began his career by
writing original dramas for the
infant television industry, back in
the early fifties. Gresham's Law
soon replaced "Marty" and
"Bachelor Party" with "Gomer
Pyle," and Mr. Chayefsky all but
disappeared, surfacing
occasionally with a screenplay or
a Broadway entry. This week ACT
opened its production of Mr.
Chayefsky's "The Latent
Heterosexual," and one cannot
help imagining the faces of the
network executives if this wierd
little comedy were ever to sneak
onto prime time.
I must point out immediately
that the title is an example of
crass commercialism at its best. It
has almost nothing to do with the
major emphasis of the play, and
the blurbs that ACT have used in
their advertising are equally
misleading. They would have you
believe that Mr. Chayefsky has
written a story about a

homosexual author who gets
married on the advice of his tax
consultant, decides he likes it, and
then gets upset when the
consultant recommends a divorce.
All of these things happen, but
that's not what the play is about.
It's actually much cleverer than
that. The Gay Lib people
shouldn't get upset because it is
established early in the first act
that the main character, John
Morley isn't really a homosexual,
he just thinks he is. What the play
is really about (and I guess this
doesn't get into the advertising
because it wouldn't sell nearly as
well) is how Morley's tax
consultant turns him for tax
purposes - into a financial empire.
Overnight Morley is
transformed from a "faggot junkie
poet" into a multimillion dollar
holding company, with interests
in publishing, pharmaceuticals,
real estate, and interstate
trucking, including subsidiaries in
three foreign countries. Getting
married is small potatoes. And
what is truly fascinating is how
Morley slowly takes on the
identity of his corporation. "I am
a Gesellschaft," he murmers
rapturously. And he means it.
Josef Sommer, a veteran actor
with years of experience in
regional theater, makes his ACT

debut in the role of John Morley.
Mr. Sommer has a rubber face and
the body of a contortionist, which
is necessary for a man who must
make the transition from a poet
to a holding company. He is a
valuable addition to the ACT
company, and I'm looking
forward to seeing him in roles.

G. Wood and Joseph Bird are
superb as Morley's is tax
consultants. They look, talk,
walk, dress and think like tax
lawyers; their business
conferences, along with Martin
Berman and Bobert Fletcher as
their associates, are mind
boggling. The byzantine financial

manipulations become not houses
of cards, but palaces, and as
debentures pile up on non-voting
common stock, the audience
shakes its head in admiration and
disbelief, until finally it breaks
out in spontaneous laughter at the
sheer audacity of the whole thing.
It could never work on
television -the audience just might
understand it, but the network
producers.
Virtually the only female part
is played by Lee McCain as the
charming, beautiful $50,000 a
year whore who marries Morley
for mutual tax advantages and
then falls in love with him. Miss
McCain doesn't have very much to
do in this play,but she does it very
well, looking every bit like a
sweet, expensive nymphomaniac.
Allen Fletcher's direction
seemed to be submerged in the
script and in the virtuoso
performances of Mr. Sommer and
Co.
The sets and costumes seem to
be a bit below the standard set by
previous ACT productions this
year. The set in particular looked
unfinished, and it didn't fit
together too well, physically or
artistically.
"The Latent Heterosexual" will
be playing in rep irtory for the
next few month' Student rush
ticket are available just before
curtail Have fun.


COST PLUS—Lee McCain sits on a chair during a dull moment in her
life as a $50,000 a year upper middle class prostitute. See more of her
thrilling sedentary skill in "Latent Heterosexual," currently on tap at
ACT.

ACT.
Oh, where are the snows of
yesteryear? How much more
painful it will be to sit in front of
the boob tube, watching nuns
collide with skyscrapers, now that
I have seen a play by Paddy
Chayefsky and have a glimmer of
what television could have been.
Mr. Chayefsky, as I am sure most
of you know, began his career by
writing original dramas for the
infant television industry, back in
the early fifties. Gresham's Law
soon replaced "Marty" and
"Bachelor Party" with "Gomer
Pyle," and Mr. Chayefsky all but
disappeared, surfacing
occasionally with a screenplay or
a Broadway entry. This week ACT
opened its production of Mr.
Chayefsky's "The Latent
Heterosexual," and one cannot
help imagining the faces of the
network executives if this wierd
little comedy were ever to sneak
onto prime time.
I must point out immediately
that the title is an example of
crass commercialism at its best. It
has almost nothing to do with the
major emphasis of the play, and
the blurbs that ACT have used in
their advertising are equally
misleading. They would have you
believe that Mr. Chayefsky has
written a story about a

homosexual author who gets
married on the advice of his tax
consultant, decides he likes it, and
then gets upset when the
consultant recommends a divorce.
All of these things happen, but
that's not what the play is about.
It's actually much cleverer than
that. The Gay Lib people
shouldn't get upset because it is
established early in the first act
that the main character, John
Morley isn't really a homosexual,
he just thinks he is. What the play
is really about (and I guess this
doesn't get into the advertising
because it wouldn't sell nearly as
well) is how Morley's tax
consultant turns him for tax
purposes - into a financial empire.
Overnight Morley is
transformed from a "faggot junkie
poet" into a multimillion dollar
holding company, with interests
in publishing, pharmaceuticals,
real estate, and interstate
trucking, including subsidiaries in
three foreign countries. Getting
married is small potatoes. And
what is truly fascinating is how
Morley slowly takes on the
identity of his corporation. "I am
a Gesellschaft," he murmers
rapturously. And he means it.
Josef Sommer, a veteran actor
with years of experience in
regional theater, makes his ACT

debut in the role of John Morley.
Mr. Sommer has a rubber face and
the body of a contortionist, which
is necessary for a man who must
make the transition from a poet
to a holding company. He is a
valuable addition to the ACT
company, and I'm looking
forward to seeing him in roles.

G. Wood and Joseph Bird are
superb as Morley's is tax
consultants. They look, talk,
walk, dress and think like tax
lawyers; their business
conferences, along with Martin
Berman and Bobert Fletcher as
their associates, are mind
boggling. The byzantine financial

manipulations become not houses
of cards, but palaces, and as
debentures pile up on non-voting
common stock, the audience
shakes its head in admiration and
disbelief, until finally it breaks
out in spontaneous laughter at the
sheer audacity of the whole thing.
It could never work on
television -the audience just might
understand it, but the network
producers.
Virtually the only female part
is played by Lee McCain as the
charming, beautiful $50,000 a
year whore who marries Morley
for mutual tax advantages and
then falls in love with him. Miss
McCain doesn't have very much to
do in this play,but she does it very
well, looking every bit like a
sweet, expensive nymphomaniac.
Allen Fletcher's direction
seemed to be submerged in the
script and in the virtuoso
performances of Mr. Sommer and
Co.
The sets and costumes seem to
be a bit below the standard set by
previous ACT productions this
year. The set in particular looked
unfinished, and it didn't fit
together too well, physically or
artistically.
"The Latent Heterosexual" will
be playing in rep irtory for the
next few month' Student rush
ticket are available just before
curtail Have fun.


COST PLUS—Lee McCain sits on a chair during a dull moment in her
life as a $50,000 a year upper middle class prostitute. See more of her
thrilling sedentary skill in "Latent Heterosexual," currently on tap at
ACT.
