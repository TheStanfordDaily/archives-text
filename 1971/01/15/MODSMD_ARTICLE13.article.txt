# 'Lust Story' Tells Tragedy Of Youth
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
What can you say about a
twenty-five year old girl who was
supposed to die, didn't and had to
be torpedoed?
This chilling question sets the
stage for the most dramatic
commentary ever filmed about
the underlying moral issues and
complex interpersonal
relationships in America today.
Erick Seagull's Lust Story, at long
last fashioned into a superb
Hollywood production, hits home
to many Americans because it is
the tragic story of two, average
young adults.
Jennifer, played to the hilt by
Miss Average herself, Ali McGraw,
is a senior at Radcliffe, who has
seen her share of molotov
cocktails and peace signs, but is
by no means ready to die at age
twenty-five. The daughter of an
oil slick, wealthy Jennifer,
referred to in rehearsal as
"gasoline Ali," is prime bait for
Oliver, a wayward handyman who
landed a job at Harvard refinishing
Nathan Pusey's mahogany desk
which was badly stained by
Radical Inc.
Oliver and Jennifer meet when
Jen, who has come to ask the
out-going Pusey to write her a
recommendation for a job on
"Cosmopolitan" magazine, is
accidentally sand-blasted by Ollie,
who is still refinishing the desk.
After smoothing over their
abrupt acquaintance, Jennifer
buys Oliver some coffee, and the
romance begins. Cinematography
and screen-play mesh flawlessly to
depict the courses that nature
follows when it nurtures the
unfettered splendor of true love.

Inevitably, however, the
intervention of a third party
looms as a seemingly
insurmountable obstacle to what
was to have been a joyous, vibrant
and, meaningful relationship.
Jennifer's father, played by Steve
Reeves, views the pedigreeless
Oliver as a drop of conotane in a
sea of STP. At first, the awesome
Reeves, known as "daddy,"
threatens to disown his only child.
But his love for her proves to be
as strong as his scorn for Paul
Ehrlich, and the ensuing
negotiations net Jennifer five oil
wells.
Seagull's true-to-life account
could well have ended here. But
the brash young author, whose
poignancy is predicated on
pursuing the pulsating problems
of today, realized that there was
yet another so try to tell.
Despite his reverent love for his
bride, the "struggling but
pragmatic Oliver decides that in
four years he will kill Jennifer and
sell the oil wells. During the 48
months of marital bliss, Ollie is
hired to refinish the desks of a top
New York lawfirm, and works
quickly to secure a will for his
wife, leaving him the oilwells.
Meanwhile, Jennifer turns down a
lucrative offer from
'Cosmopolitan'and devotes herself
fulltime to the duties of a
housewife.
The fateful year arrives finding
Ollie quite prepared to carry out
the simple demise of twenty-five
year old Jennifer. But the bottle
of sleeping capsules that he
sprinkles liberally into her coffee
proves to be no match for her
chronic insomnia; he severs the
brakes on their automobile only
to remember that Jennifer does
not drive.
On .a whim, and out of
desperation, Oliver whisks
Jennifer off to an island of
celebrities for a second
honeymoon. Jennifer is an instant
hit on the island, and is
sequestered to do everything from
taking pictures with famous
actors, to putting her foot prints
on the wet cement sidewalks of
newly-opened establishments. On
one such occasion, Oliver eyes
Richard Benjamin, a jilted
boyfriend from Jennifer's past,
converses with him briefly as he
slips him some cash, and watches
with mock horror as Benjamin
gives Jennifer her last pair of
cement shoes and dumps her into
a nearby wharf.
Oliver caps a convincing
performance as he cries out into
the darkness, "Being in love
means never having to say you're
sorry!"
