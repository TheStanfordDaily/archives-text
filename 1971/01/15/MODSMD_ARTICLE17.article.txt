After one unbelievable week,
it's amazing that gymnastic Coach
Dan Millman has any sense of
humor left. This past five days,
fate has been testing young Coach
Millman.
The Indian gymnasts open their
season today in Sacramento
against Sacramento State.
Stanford has lots its top five
gymnasts in as many days to every
possible cause imaginable. The
Tribe's top performer last year,
senior Steve Rochell, has been
sidelined by a procedural error
resulting in his temporary
ineligibility.
Freshman phenom and
ex-Olympian Steve Hug has been
derailed by a back injury and is
not expected to return until late
March.
Ted Miyamoto decided this
week to redshirt. Bob Horwitz
suffered torn shoulder muscles in
practice this week and, Shawn
Skerrett, is out with the
chickenpox.
"I don't think we'll win it,"
Millman confessed.
"Don't get me wrong. We're
still serious, but it's been
necessary to keep our sense of
humor," Coach Millman
commented.
