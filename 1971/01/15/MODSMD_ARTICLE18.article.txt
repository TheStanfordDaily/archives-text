Stanford's varsity wrestliers

meet Chico State tomorrow at
Chico. Although Coach Dave
Reed's squad remains weakened
by injuries and retirements, Reed
is confident that his team will do
well at Chico.
With two matches being
forfeited because of injuries, the
Cards need to win at least six of
the remaining eight classes.
"Chico State lost badly to
Humboldt State last week. The
only wins for Chico were in the
two classes we have to give away.
Spotting them ten points means
we'll have to win six of the other
eight matches," Reed said.
The two injuries were suffered
by sophomore co-captain David
Kapolow and 126 lb. Matt
Haynes. Kapolow was sidelined in
the 118 lb. class with a shoulder
injury.
The Indian matmen will be led
by highly-improved co-captain
David Thomas in the 15 0 class, up
and coming freshman Ken Krebs
at 134, outstanding 142 lb. Chris
Horpel, and a fine 167 lb.
prospect, Bob Schloutz.
Coach Reed sees his squad as an
"improving team and a strong
tournament team.
"I consider tomorrow's meet an
even match," Reed said.
