Stanford's varsity swim team
travels north today to Corvallis to
compete with the Oregon State
Beavers. Tomorrow, the Indians
take on the Oregon Ducks.

"A lot of our men will be
switching off in events in Corvallis
and getting some experience,"
Coack Jim Gaughran explained.
Saturday, the Indians will go
with their first team against the
Ducks. Coach Gaughran sees
sprints and diving as the
Oregonians' strongholds.
"Oregon is pretty good. They
have excellent diving and good
sprinters led by Rich Ross. In the

diving, Ted Nichols will face some
tough competition," Gaughran
commented.
In the breastroke, Brian Job
and Dave Shilling will challenge
Oregon's Mike Dirksen. Coach
Gaughran says Dirksen is rated
third in the world in breaststroke.
Sprinter Steve Carey should
provide the Indians with a potent
sprint threat with his return this
weekend.


UP, UP, AND AWAYâ€”Stanford gymnast Murray Kephart will see
action in both the high bar and free exercise in a meet tomorrow night
at Sacramento State. The first home meet for the Indians is next
Saturday against the University of Oregon.
