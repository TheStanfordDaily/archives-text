# Curricula Expanding
## Woman's Studies-A New Trend 
### BEVERLY HASHIMOTO 
Over 40 colleges across the country
are including or planning to include
courses on women in their regular
curriculum.
A study conducted last fall by the
Modern Language Commission on the
Status of Women in Professions also
found that four universities—San Diego
State, Cornell, Wesleyan, and
Wesberry—even offer a complete
departmental major in feminist studies.
Stanford is part of the trend toward
women's studies. This quarter three
classes on the subject are being offered
for academic credit — "Race and Sex in
the United States," "American
Feminism in the Nineteenth Century,"
and "Alternative Life Styles for
Women."
Sandra Bern, a visiting professor here

in psychology, recently talked with a
Daily reporter about the nascient field.
Bern observed that in primitive tribal
societies physical strength determined
the tasks of males and females.
However, Bern finds, "as a result of our
sophisticated technological society,
strength is no longer a key factor."
As a result, she says, women have
gained interest in job involvement. In
addition, the latest birth control
methods, family planning centers, and
day care organizations have increased
the freedom of women.
Fewer Women
But even with this increased
freedom, a recent study shows that the
percentage of women currently in
graduate schools is smaller than the
percentage of females who studied in
graduate schools in the 1 920's and
1 9 30's.

This result has focused attention
upon the problem: Do women have
equal career opportunities with men?
The awakening consciousness that
females can maintain an identity
independent of a husband and family has
been encouraged by the study programs
installed on the university level. The
new academic programs concerning
women are not exposing the problems
which females have encountered when
they choose to gain human satisfaction
from life patterns not traditionally
associated with women.
New Courses
The history colloquium "Race and
Sex in the United States" is taught by
Professor Carl Degler. This course is
concerned with the relationship
between the social situation of women
and the experience of racial minorities.
A novel covered in the course is The
Awakening by Kate Chopin. This book
reveals the struggle of a woman to gain
an independent self in the 1 8 00's.
The American Feminism course
headed by Brian Strong is not only
involved with the suffrage movement of
the past century, but it also covers
some aspects of the condition of
women today. One of the books read
in the class is the best seller The
Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan.
This particular book has become a
standard text in the area of female
study.
SWOPS I Course
Another approach to the study of
women is offered in the SWOPSI
program. The course entitled
"Alternative Life Styles for Women" is
presently sponsored by Professor
Eleanor Maccohy and is lead by Dr.
Barbara Almond. Dr. Almond believes
that although the course takes a
scholarly approach to the subject of

women's social possibilities, the group's
research "will produce creative and
personal answers to the topic."
Besides these classes offered for
credit in the Stanford curriculum, other
small, informal study groups have been
formed by interested and motivated
students. One such informal discussion
group consisting of 2 0 freshman girls is
the Mirlo House Seminar concerning
"The Roles of Women in American
Society." Kris Williams, a resident of
Mirlo, is the main organizer of this
project.
The impact that these women's
studies programs may have upon future
social change is still not predictable,
but even after the novelty of these
courses wear away, "we will never," in
Professor Degler's words, "go back to
the way we were before."

curriculum.
A study conducted last fall by the
Modern Language Commission on the
Status of Women in Professions also
found that four universities—San Diego
State, Cornell, Wesleyan, and
Wesberry—even offer a complete
departmental major in feminist studies.
Stanford is part of the trend toward
women's studies. This quarter three
classes on the subject are being offered
for academic credit — "Race and Sex in
the United States," "American
Feminism in the Nineteenth Century,"
and "Alternative Life Styles for
Women."
Sandra Bern, a visiting professor here

in psychology, recently talked with a
Daily reporter about the nascient field.
Bern observed that in primitive tribal
societies physical strength determined
the tasks of males and females.
However, Bern finds, "as a result of our
sophisticated technological society,
strength is no longer a key factor."
As a result, she says, women have
gained interest in job involvement. In
addition, the latest birth control
methods, family planning centers, and
day care organizations have increased
the freedom of women.
Fewer Women
But even with this increased
freedom, a recent study shows that the
percentage of women currently in
graduate schools is smaller than the
percentage of females who studied in
graduate schools in the 1 920's and
1 9 30's.

This result has focused attention
upon the problem: Do women have
equal career opportunities with men?
The awakening consciousness that
females can maintain an identity
independent of a husband and family has
been encouraged by the study programs
installed on the university level. The
new academic programs concerning
women are not exposing the problems
which females have encountered when
they choose to gain human satisfaction
from life patterns not traditionally
associated with women.
New Courses
The history colloquium "Race and
Sex in the United States" is taught by
Professor Carl Degler. This course is
concerned with the relationship
between the social situation of women
and the experience of racial minorities.
A novel covered in the course is The
Awakening by Kate Chopin. This book
reveals the struggle of a woman to gain
an independent self in the 1 8 00's.
The American Feminism course
headed by Brian Strong is not only
involved with the suffrage movement of
the past century, but it also covers
some aspects of the condition of
women today. One of the books read
in the class is the best seller The
Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan.
This particular book has become a
standard text in the area of female
study.
SWOPS I Course
Another approach to the study of
women is offered in the SWOPSI
program. The course entitled
"Alternative Life Styles for Women" is
presently sponsored by Professor
Eleanor Maccohy and is lead by Dr.
Barbara Almond. Dr. Almond believes
that although the course takes a
scholarly approach to the subject of

women's social possibilities, the group's
research "will produce creative and
personal answers to the topic."
Besides these classes offered for
credit in the Stanford curriculum, other
small, informal study groups have been
formed by interested and motivated
students. One such informal discussion
group consisting of 2 0 freshman girls is
the Mirlo House Seminar concerning
"The Roles of Women in American
Society." Kris Williams, a resident of
Mirlo, is the main organizer of this
project.
The impact that these women's
studies programs may have upon future
social change is still not predictable,
but even after the novelty of these
courses wear away, "we will never," in
Professor Degler's words, "go back to
the way we were before."
