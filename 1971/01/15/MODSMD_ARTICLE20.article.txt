# Coming In From Los Angeles

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Oh boy, it's that time of year
again. Once again those wonders
of the Southland will dribble up
the state and into Maples Pavilion
for their annual performance.
To the musical accompaniment
of their blue-blazered band,
UCLA's court magicians will go
through their usual pre-game
Globetrotter antics and then
proceed to soundly defeat
Stanford's basket bailers.

That's the way the script has
gone for the last four years, and
barring a miracle which would
have to rival that of Harold
Stassen becoming President, it will
happen again tonight.
The team which has won six of
the last seven national
championships and which is
top-ranked and unbeaten in 11
games this year, should have little
trouble overcoming a Stanford
five weakened considerably by
injuries.

Starting guard Dennis O'Neill
has a pinched nerve in his neck
and is doubtful. Reserve forward
Bob Buell, who had just recovered
from ankle problems, re-injured
his knee Monday and will not
even suit up. So Coach Howie
Dallmar will go with two
sophomore guards, Pat Husco
(6-4) and John Stratton (6-2).
Both have had fifteen point games
this season,but their inexperience
is bound to hurt. Claude Terry
(6-5), the team's leading scorer
with an 18.3 average, will move
up from guard and join Chuck
Moore (6-4 ) in the front line. And
Mike Michel (6-6), who has
averaged 13.4 and 7.1 rebounds a
game will go at center.
The cast these five brave souls
will go up against is pretty
awesome. The UCLA front line is
averaging 5 8.4 (joints and 36.7
rebounds per game. 6-8 forward
Sidney Wicks is the team leader in
both categories with 23.9 points
and 13.3 rebounds. 6-7 forward
Curtis Rowe and 6-9 center Steve
Patterson are close behind at 22 .0
and 12.5 points, and 10 and 12.4
rebounds respectively.
The Bruin guards will probably
be Henry Bibby (6-0) and Terry
Schofield (6-3), although Coach
Johnny Wooden may go with
Kenny Booker (6-4). Bibby is
averaging 11.7 points and
Schofield is shooting at a 49.3%
clip, but with Wicks and Rowe
shooting at 5 6.3% and 58%
respectively, the Bruins can do
without an offensively
phenomenal backcourt.
Stanford's stragegy against
UCLA will probably be to try and
spread out the Bruin defense.
Slowing the pace of the game

down, (and taking only good
shots,) is almost essential, since no
one can really run with UCLA,
especially a team as slow as
Stanford. Regardless of what
strategy the Cards employ, it is
hard to imagine them overcoming
the mastery of UCLA.
In past years, one of the few
happy things about a basketball
weekend with UCLA was that in
the same weekend, Stanford
always played USC and if they
didn't beat the Trojans, they at
least made a game out of it. But
even this may change tomorrow
night.
The Trojans have finally
succeeded in breaking UCLA's
domination of Southern
California basketball, and
according to which poll you live
by, they are ranked second or
third in the country.
USC is unbeaten in 12 games
this year and they feature a wide
open run and shoot style. Their
bench strength has been crucial to
their success this year and usually
9 or 10 men see considerable
playing time.
The starting five for the Trojans
on Saturday night will probably
be composed of guards Paul
Westphal (6-4 ) and Dennis Layton
(6-0); forwards Joe Mackey (6-6)
and Chris Schrobilgen (6-6), and
center Ron Riley (6-8).
Westphal and Layton are both
fine shooters and Mackey and
Schrobilgen have scored big when
necessary. Riley has been
particularly tough on the boards,
averaging almost 18 rebounds a
game. And if any of the starters
have problems, Coach Bob Boyd
can go to his infinitely-talented
bench.

But alas, not all is bad. In 6 :00
preliminaries to the varsity
contests, Stanford's undefeated
freshmen team (5 -0) will put their
record on the line against De Anza
Junior College tonight, and San
Francisco City College tomorrow
night.
The Papooses have been led so
far by 6-9 center Mike Mann, who
is averaging 20 points and better
than 10 rebounds per game.
Approximately 1000 student
tickets for tonight's UCLA game
will go on sale at around 5:00
p.m. Tickets will also be available

for tomorrow night's USC game.
It is doubtful that Stanford will
win either night. But if they play
the kind of scrappy and
hard-nosed game they have in the
past, they will be entertaining at
least. And Stanford's freshmen
show some promise of a brighter
future.
The Bruins and Trojans will
probably drop in for a few hours,
extend their winning streaks, and
then head back to the land of
beaches and sun-smogged dollies.
Oh well, we still know who won
the Rose Bowl.


SOPHOMORE STAR-John Stratton will have a big job tonight when
he moves into the starting lineup for the injured Dennis O'Neill. The
6-2 guard has averaged 3.5 points a game, but will be in tough against
the fine backcourt men of the UCLA Bruins.
