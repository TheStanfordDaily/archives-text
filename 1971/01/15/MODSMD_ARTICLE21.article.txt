Bomb Suspects Hunted
LONDON — Scotland Yard assigned 300 detectives
Thursday to comb London for militants suspected in
the bombing of one Cabinet minister's home and a
kidnap threat against another minister. They were
seeking to run down a terror gang known as the
Angry Brigade.
The detectives fanned out to homes, lodging
houses, clubs, all-night cafes and coffee bars in their
quest for those who bombed the home of
Employment Minister Robert Carr and threatened to
seize Education Minister Margaret Thatcher.
The police were reported to be seeking an anarchist
in his 20s also suspected of plotting a bomb attack on
the Spanish Iberia Airline office last August. He is
said to be chief of a team of about a half dozen men
dedicated to spreading violence and terror throughout
Britain.
A London newspaper received a letter crudely
printed by hand which said: "Carr got it
tonight.. . were sic getting closer."
The note was signed "The Angry Brigade." It was
posted in the area where Carr's Georgian-style home
was damaged by two powerful time bombs Tuesday
night.
Despite the startlingly violent turn to British
politics, Cabinet ministers decided Thursday against
permanent armed body-guards for all ministers.
Four men, reported to be Welsh nationalists, tried
to break into Westminster Palace, the home of
Parliament, but were captured at the foot of Big Ben
by police and guards of the House of Commons.

Heavy Fighting Erupts
SAIGON — Savage fighting erupted on Cambodia's
Highway 4 Thursday in what could be one of the
major battles for the country's most important
supply line.
The Cambodian high command in Phnom Penh
reported that the lead element of a combined
Cambodian-South Vietnamese northbound strike
force came under violent attack 95 miles southwest
of the capital.
The command gave no details but said fighting was
still raging toward nightfall on the highway near
Stung Chhay Pawss, one of the two on the
American-built highway that have been in the hands
of North Vietnamese troops since Nov. 21.
Smut Laws Overruled
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court barred the
Post Office Thursday from intercepting mail to
publishers of obscene books and magazines.
In a unanimous decision, Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. said two federal laws used by the Post
Office were not "sensitive" enough to the 4 th right of
free speech.
The laws were declared unconstitutional. Brennan
quoted the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that
"use of the mails is almost as much a part of free
speech as the right to use our tongues."

However, the decision does not affect the
government's power to prosecute dealers. Also, the
court specifically by-passed the question of whether
people have a constitutional right to receive obscene
books and devices by mail.
Post Office officials said they will continue to
enforce criminal laws against dealers "with vigor."
And they reminded that Congress has prohibited
delivery of material to people who asked to be kept
off mailing lists.
Police Seek Gunmen
SAN FRANCISCO — Police hunted yesterday for five
men who they say wounded two policemen in a
surprise volley of gunfire at their squad car in the
Haight-Ashbury District.
Patrolmen Dennis Jacobson, 23, and Robert
Martinez, 23 were shot when their car halted at a stop
sign about 11 :30 p.m. Wednesday night.
Both men were reported in good condition at San
Francisco General Hospital.
The attack at Steiner and Waller streets occurred
three blocks from the spot where Patrolman Richard
Radetich was shot and killed in his patrol car last
June as he wrote a routine traffic ticket.
Capt. Ernest Raabe said the two officers had
radioed for a stolen car check and were waiting a
response when the attack occurred.

Bomb Suspects Hunted
LONDON — Scotland Yard assigned 300 detectives
Thursday to comb London for militants suspected in
the bombing of one Cabinet minister's home and a
kidnap threat against another minister. They were
seeking to run down a terror gang known as the
Angry Brigade.
The detectives fanned out to homes, lodging
houses, clubs, all-night cafes and coffee bars in their
quest for those who bombed the home of
Employment Minister Robert Carr and threatened to
seize Education Minister Margaret Thatcher.
The police were reported to be seeking an anarchist
in his 20s also suspected of plotting a bomb attack on
the Spanish Iberia Airline office last August. He is
said to be chief of a team of about a half dozen men
dedicated to spreading violence and terror throughout
Britain.
A London newspaper received a letter crudely
printed by hand which said: "Carr got it
tonight.. . were sic getting closer."
The note was signed "The Angry Brigade." It was
posted in the area where Carr's Georgian-style home
was damaged by two powerful time bombs Tuesday
night.
Despite the startlingly violent turn to British
politics, Cabinet ministers decided Thursday against
permanent armed body-guards for all ministers.
Four men, reported to be Welsh nationalists, tried
to break into Westminster Palace, the home of
Parliament, but were captured at the foot of Big Ben
by police and guards of the House of Commons.

Heavy Fighting Erupts
SAIGON — Savage fighting erupted on Cambodia's
Highway 4 Thursday in what could be one of the
major battles for the country's most important
supply line.
The Cambodian high command in Phnom Penh
reported that the lead element of a combined
Cambodian-South Vietnamese northbound strike
force came under violent attack 95 miles southwest
of the capital.
The command gave no details but said fighting was
still raging toward nightfall on the highway near
Stung Chhay Pawss, one of the two on the
American-built highway that have been in the hands
of North Vietnamese troops since Nov. 21.
Smut Laws Overruled
WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court barred the
Post Office Thursday from intercepting mail to
publishers of obscene books and magazines.
In a unanimous decision, Justice William J.
Brennan Jr. said two federal laws used by the Post
Office were not "sensitive" enough to the 4 th right of
free speech.
The laws were declared unconstitutional. Brennan
quoted the late Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes that
"use of the mails is almost as much a part of free
speech as the right to use our tongues."

However, the decision does not affect the
government's power to prosecute dealers. Also, the
court specifically by-passed the question of whether
people have a constitutional right to receive obscene
books and devices by mail.
Post Office officials said they will continue to
enforce criminal laws against dealers "with vigor."
And they reminded that Congress has prohibited
delivery of material to people who asked to be kept
off mailing lists.
Police Seek Gunmen
SAN FRANCISCO — Police hunted yesterday for five
men who they say wounded two policemen in a
surprise volley of gunfire at their squad car in the
Haight-Ashbury District.
Patrolmen Dennis Jacobson, 23, and Robert
Martinez, 23 were shot when their car halted at a stop
sign about 11 :30 p.m. Wednesday night.
Both men were reported in good condition at San
Francisco General Hospital.
The attack at Steiner and Waller streets occurred
three blocks from the spot where Patrolman Richard
Radetich was shot and killed in his patrol car last
June as he wrote a routine traffic ticket.
Capt. Ernest Raabe said the two officers had
radioed for a stolen car check and were waiting a
response when the attack occurred.
