# Court To Hear Los Siete Dismissal Motion Today
## 
### 
A court in Redwood City will listen
to arguments today on a motion for
dismissal of the Ixjs Siete de la Raza.
The six Mexican-Americans have been
arraigned on charges of armed robbery
and car theft.
Wednesday two of the six men
claimed that the charges were filed a
year after the incident only because the
six were recently found innocent of the
murder of a San Francisco policeman.
Wilbur Johnson, chief criminal
deputy district attorney for San Mateo

County denied the charge yesterday.
"The murder trial took precedence,"
Johnson said. "As soon as that was
finished we proceeded immediately
with arraignment on the San Mateo
County charges."
Tony Martinez, 21, and Danilo
Menlendez ,18, made the charges at a
press conference at the Redwood City
headquarters of Venceremos College.
Martinez, Melendez and four other
members of 1.,0s Siete are charged with
the rifle-point robbery of Redwood
City store clerk Daniel Goodell, 34, at
San Gregorio Beach.
The incident took place on May 6,
1 969, five days after the slaying of
officer Joseph Brodnik in San
Francisco. The six were also charged
with that slaying.
Charles Garry, chief defense attorney
for Los Siete in the recent murder trial
stated that his clients "failed to get fair
treatment from the state. If they had
been treated fairly they wouldn't have
been put on trial."
Four of the defendants will
eventually face additional charges for
kidnapping in Santa Cruz. Further,two
of the six were recently arrested for
possession of marijuana and will have
to stand trial in San Jose.
