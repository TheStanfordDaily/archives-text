# Educator Explains Why Thinking Is Not The Way To Inner Peace
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
"A total radical revolution in the
nature of the entire consciousness of
man is needed to bring about change in
our society," said Robert Carr in the
last of three talks sponsored by a
newly-formed student group,
Education is Awareness.
His talk began by demonstrating that
the relationships between people
constitute society and that society's
problems are functions of the
confusion within the minds of
individuals.
"We must want with our whole being
to understand ourselves," Carr stated.
He asked the audience to see the
urgency of changing from a confused
state of mind into one of silence and
peace. "Perhaps we can live in this
world without being psychologically
bruised," he added.
All our thoughts and perceptions are
preconceived results of our
backgrounds, Carr pointed out.
Carr, a multi-media communications

expert now working in Seattle,
discussed awareness, self-understanding,
and the way to inner peace during his
lectures Monday through Wednesday
nights at Tresidder.
Facts and Ourselves
Thinking, remembering, and forming
opinions creates a division between
facts and ourselves, Carr believes. "If
you are aware of an observation, the
observation itself will cease and you are
aware only of yourself observing. We go
through the process of thinking about
the fact rather than perceiving the
fact," he said.
Carr suggested that since thoughts, as
products of the past, cause our
problems, we should cease thinking
about events and emotions and simply
be aware of them. "If we can look at
something without comparisons and
opinions and value judgments, there is
no need for thought. We make contact
by being free of opinions," he
commented.
If we become aware of the structure

of our thoughts and of our minds, Carr
went on, we will no longer be
controlled and confused by them "The
mind, by being aware of itself, can
come to its own quietness," he said.
Chitter-Chatter
In the state of quietness Can
described, the mind is free of the
"chitter-chatter" of thoughts and is left
with physiological memories, feelings,
and a direct awareness of the world
around it. Since "thinking about our
state causes the problems, not the state
itself," we can be free of our problems
in this state of mental quietness.
Carr stressed his belief that a person
can reach the state of quietness only be
becoming aware of his mental processes
and desiring to change them. He rejects
religion, psychoanalysis, and any other
systems or patterns of behavior as
methods of reaching the state of
quietness. "You don't need an
authority to understand yourself," he
insisted.
