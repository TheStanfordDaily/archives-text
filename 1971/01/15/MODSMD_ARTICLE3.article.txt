### 
LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - President
Nixon, addressing students and faculty
members at the University of Nebraska,
called yesterday for "an alliance
between generations."
"There can be no generation gap in
America,"he declared.
"The destiny of this nation is not
divided into yours and ours - it is one
destiny."
Nothing that national voting rights
have been extended to 18-year-olds,
Nixon called on young people to try
out "the system."
The President's address was
combined with a tribute to Nebraska's
undefeated football team. He presented
to coach Bob Devaney and team
captains a plague signed by Nixon and
reading: "University of Nebraska 197 0
football team. Champions of the Big
Eight conference. Victor in the 1971

Orange Bowl game. Picked by The
Associated Press No. 1 team in the
nation."
When thunderous applause greeted
Devaney, Nixon turned to him and
said, "You ought to run for something
in this state."
About 8 ,5 00 students and faculty
members filled the University's
Coliseum for the Nixon speech.
Few Protests
Nixon's own friendly reception was
marred only by a few scattered cries of
"peace now" as he was introduced -
cries quickly downed out by boos of
disapproval and cheers from other
students.
Nixon said his administration has no
higher priority than to end the war in
Vietnam.
But his emphasis was on the role of
youth in achieving what he termed
"great goals" in dealing with problems
of the environment, decay of the cities,
overpopulation, rural ills and"the
problems of prosperity itself — the
problems of poverty in a land of
plenty."
New Agency
Nixon made but one announcement
of a new administration aim in his
remarks aimed at the 21 ,000 students
at the university. He said he will send a
special message to the 1971 Congress
proposing a new agency that would
bring together the Peace Corps, VISTA
and related federal efforts to utilize
volunteer service.
Nixon said his new agency, yet to be
named, would "give young Americans
an expanded opportunity for the
services they want to give and that will
give them what is not now offered, a
chance to transfer between service
abroad and at home."
In reciting the multiple problems
facing the country, the President
declared:
"We must meet them together. There
can be no generation gap in America.
The destiny of this nation is not
divided into yours and ours it is one

destiny. We share it together. We are
responsible for it together."
Appeal To Youth
The chief executive, in his broadest
appeal yet to the young people who
will be voting for the first time in 1972 ,
said, "Let us forge an alliance between
generations."
Citing 197 0 legislation that gives
voting rights in federal elections to
18 years of age or older, Nixon
said:
"So much is in your hands now. To
