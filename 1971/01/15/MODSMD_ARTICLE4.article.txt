# Stiffer Welfare Policy, Says Spiro

SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) - Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew said
Thursday the nation's welfare dilemma
can only be solved completely when
someone is willing to make tough
decisions such as telling a welfare
mother she can't have an> more babies.
Or, Agnew added, whether a man on
public health insurance with a terminal
illness should "be kept alive an extra
month at the cost of $20,000 to
$30,000 to the taxpayers."
"Who decides that care is to be
continued?" Agnew asked during a
two-hour long state Capitol discussion
with state and local officials over the
crisis of government finance.
Agnew did not suggest that any
public official is willing to make such
decisions now, but "we get up here so
frequently at these meetings and talk
about the superficialities of these
problems."
Those who would make such
decisions probably wouldn't last long in
office, he added, "because we would
then be in a position to be victimized
by the demagogues who seek office and
who seek always to mouth the
platitudes and say the good things."
