# Urban Studies Program Offered
## 
### 
The inner city ills of San Francisco
such as delapidated housing, drug
abuse, sagging finances, and urban
ecology will be the targets of study
groups that will include Stanford
students.
Organized through the Student
Center for Innovation in Research and
Education (SCIRE), students will join a
volunteer study group made up of San
Francisco lawyers, businessmen and
other professionals. The program will
range across the broad area of public
problems and report their findings to
the city's Board of Supervisors' head
Dianne Feinstein.
"This is an ideal place where
students can take up specific projects,"
said James Haas, a San Francisco
lawyer who is head of the program.

Students will be able to receive
credit for their work. The groups will
take an in-depth look at city problems,
attend supervisors' meetings, and keep
Mrs. Feinstein informed on their
findings.
"If a student wants to get involved in
a real problem, then here it is," said
SCIRE director Lana De Salvo. "It's
not too often a student can get real
results."
Haas is confident that students will
have major responsibilities by digging
up most of the study groups'
information. "One of the reasons we
want to attract students from Stanford
and other places is that those presently
involved have full-time jobs—basic

research is difficult," he said. He felt
there was little time to "go out and
start fresh."
SCIRE leaders hope to bring Mrs.
Feinstein to campus soon to discuss
city problems.
Credit arrangements will be worked
out with the five faculty members and
six students on the SCIRE Policy
Board. Set up last spring, the
student-run organization is designed to
help students formulate courses on
their own and grant credit for such
work.
Students interested in the urban
program or projects of their own
should stop by the SCIRE office in the
basement of the Nlterv.
