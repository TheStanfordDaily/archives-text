# the 						tube test
## Ego-Tripping 
###

The beauty of things in nature
is that they don't get hung up on
one thing. That is how an earlier
article of mine, "The Ego Thing,"
began, and my strongest critic
objects to being called a "tube
shaped pattern." Might I suggest
that he is hung up on one
thing—his ego.
Like John Fountain, most
people still believe they are really
egos, packaged in skin,
disconnected with nature. .John's
proof of this is like a similar proof
offered in the eighteenth century
by Dr. Johnson, who kicked a
stone to prove it existed. John
would kick someone in the groin
to prove their ego exists.
Apparently, if the tube doubles
up it is not a tube but an ego. This
is the tube test.
I will remind this misguided
critic that a porcupine dissected
with a razor will squeal and a
gorilla kicked in the groin will
double up. This is not proof of an
ego, but very crude proof that the
whole organism hurts. The tube
test stinks.
It is the peculiar mistake of
most of us to fail to see ourselves
as full organisms. An organism, of
course, is part of an
environment-field, so that there is
a constant exchange of energy.
"Tube-shaped pattern" is not a
bad description of that, John.
This means that an organism
only superficially ends at the
skin—the real organism is
inseparable from its environment.
That's why there is no difference
between poisoning the air and
poisoning people. Only a time lag.
For the whole organism
environment field the most
dangerous enemy is, of course, the
ego—the pea-brained bully who
thinks the world revolves around
his little persona-lity. His
"persona" is his "mask," a false
face he parades before the world.
But he who wears the false face of
his little ego too long soon
confuses it with the whole
organism—and a lot of things
follow from his confusion.
The ego is a fiction, an illusion

that leads people to confront and
conquer nature rather than
moving with it. This only goes on
for a limited time before nature
fights back. Thus we are
experiencing the iron laws of
nature at work, as the poison
seeps back into our own blood
and bones.
But more than being a positive
danger for everyone, the fictional
ego is particularly vulnerable. It
needs to be patted and praised,
boosted and put on a pedestal. It
demands prestige, status,
authority, power. It is therefore
ripe for suffering, and ripe for
exploitation.
The real organism requires only
food, clothing, shelter, and a
satisfactory sex life. Perhaps a few
non-material "goods" like
laughter and fun, and a bit of
dancing. But the fictional ego
requires tons of extra trash.
Closets and drawers full of clothes
and shoes, jewelery, makeup,
mechanical gadgets, flashy cars,
and paper ego-boosters like
diplomas and degrees. Moreover,
the fictional ego requires a steady
stream of this junk so that it does
not fall behind all the other
fictional egos.
None of this shiny stuff is sold
to the real, whole, human being,
but to the false self—lost in the
mazes of commercial sex, paper
securities, hidden persuaders. It is
sold to people who are
ego-tripping all over the place. It
is sold on false promises because it
can never satisfy a false ego.
Part of this delusion are the
clubs and groups which pretend to
treat people as non-egos by
sharing and meeting together. But
most of such groups-the Masons,
Shriners, Catholics, SDS, Women's
Lib—just form Group Egos. Under
the guise of the Righteous Cause
groups bully some people
into making donations while
putting the rest into an inferior
out-group. Even heaven used to be
this way, with the Saved gloating
over the parapets at the Damned
writhing in hell.
And finally there are the really

Big Egos-like the American
Government. These Huge Egos,
too are a fiction. Thus they "sell"
people with abstract nonsense like
honor (An honorable peace),
victory (We will not be defeated),
pride (We will not be humiliated),
power (This Great Nation of
ours). When too many Big Egos
play this game and back it up with
firepower, the result is war.
Moreover, our cities are running
wild with self-made bombers and
guerrilla fighters who are little
more than frustrated little egos
bumping heads. Their causes are
abstract ego-trips (Power to the
people).
The ego-game is a tale tole by
an idiot, the grandest mass-illusion
ever invented. It is a destructive
fiction which leads to loneliness,
frustration, aggression, violence,
war, and environmental
destruction. It leads to the verbal
overkill of mv critic's letter.

No, John. I am not "an inert
biochemical programmed event."
Not while I can still see myself as
part of the cosmic dance. That
makes me free. But you—if you
are "just" an ego—then you are in
danger of becoming a
programmed event, for you are
vulnerable to the worst delusions
civilization can come up with.
You are ripe for doing abstract
work you don't like, striving to
collect insurance policies before
the undertaker collects you,
striving to be a whole person in a
corporate state that has you
pegged as a mere consumer. Play
the ego game and you will be
dehumanized by Wall Street,
which will pare you down to the
"safe" level of Middle America
awareness, and bribe you with the
obscene goods of the effluent
society.
