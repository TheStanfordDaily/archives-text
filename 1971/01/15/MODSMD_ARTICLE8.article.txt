the women's movement

When we women pay tuition,
we pay health care fees. Why then
must we pay an extra $7.50 for a
PAP smear when we go to Cowell
for contraception? A group of
women went to find out why. The
head of Cowell assurred them that
this extra fee was not intended to
deter women from seeking birth
control at Cowell. Although he
expressed a desire to give PAP
tests free, he explained that
Cowell's budget could not handle
the cost of sending PAP smears to
the Palo Alto Clinic where they
are analyzed. The university
administration would not allot
any money for this purpose.
If the decision to charge for
PAP tests was purely economic,
then why did the university
withhold money from this one

particular service? Cowell refers
many other student cases it can't
handle to the Palo Alto Clinic.
When the Palo Alto Clinic does
the medical tests, the student is
not charged. When a woman has a
PAP test at Cowell without
receiving contraception, she is not
charged. Why this discrimination
against women who want to
exercise their right to control
their own bodies?
On the one hand we're told
that Cowell charges only for very
special cases that affect a tiny
minority of students—such as
allergy shots. On the other hand
we're told that we pay a fee
because such a large number of
women (about a thousand) have
come to Cowell for birth control.
Neither of these contradictory

answers justifies the $7.5 0 fee.
Women should not be treated as a
tiny, abnormal minority; and the
administration should realize that
birth control affects not just
women, but men too. Everyone
should share the burden.
The reason we're paying is that
in sexual relations between men
and women, women have always
paid: with guilty rejection from
society, dangerous abortions, or
the burden of unwanted children.
Now Stanford has modernized
this custom, and we can simply
"pay for our sins" in cash.
By refusing to cover women for
PAP tests, the university could be
causing a serious health problem.
Many women, who can't afford a
$7.50 PAP test plus $12.00 for
pills every six months, try to get

their prescriptions refilled without
being re-examined. Some doctors
at Cowell have suggested that
perhaps a yearly pelvic
examination is enough. Many
medical students were shocked to
hear this suggestion. They feel
that in view of the dubious effects
the pill can have on a woman's
body, any woman, who risks
taking the pill, should have a
pelvic examination every six
months.
This PAP test problem concerns
not only the larger issue of
women's rights, but also the larger
problem of health care in general
at Stanford. Cowell's budget is so
tight that it can't provide proper
care to anyone. On the
university's list of priorities,
health care comes very low, while
hard sciences and defense of
buildings come very high. If
Cowell can offer only very poor
medical care to students, it can
offer no services at all to Stanford
workers and families of graduate
students.
At a recent women's meeting,
women enthusiastically received
the suggestion that all women
who are billed for PAP smears
send their bills to Lyman. If, in
addition, you want to join other
women in improving health care
for everyone at Stanford, and if
you want to find out about other
issues that women can act on,
come to a meeting in Donner
Lounge on Monday, .Jan. 18. at
8 :00 p.m.

By refusing to cover women for
PAP tests, the university could be
causing a serious health problem.
Many women, who can't afford a
$7.50 PAP test plus $12.00 for
pills every six months, try to get

their prescriptions refilled without
being re-examined. Some doctors
at Cowell have suggested that
perhaps a yearly pelvic
examination is enough. Many
medical students were shocked to
hear this suggestion. They feel
that in view of the dubious effects
the pill can have on a woman's
body, any woman, who risks
taking the pill, should have a
pelvic examination every six
months.
This PAP test problem concerns
not only the larger issue of
women's rights, but also the larger
problem of health care in general
at Stanford. Cowell's budget is so
tight that it can't provide proper
care to anyone. On the
university's list of priorities,
health care comes very low, while
hard sciences and defense of
buildings come very high. If
Cowell can offer only very poor
medical care to students, it can
offer no services at all to Stanford
workers and families of graduate
students.
At a recent women's meeting,
women enthusiastically received
the suggestion that all women
who are billed for PAP smears
send their bills to Lyman. If, in
addition, you want to join other
women in improving health care
for everyone at Stanford, and if
you want to find out about other
issues that women can act on,
come to a meeting in Donner
Lounge on Monday, .Jan. 18. at
8 :00 p.m.

When we women pay tuition,
we pay health care fees. Why then
must we pay an extra $7.50 for a
PAP smear when we go to Cowell
for contraception? A group of
women went to find out why. The
head of Cowell assurred them that
this extra fee was not intended to
deter women from seeking birth
control at Cowell. Although he
expressed a desire to give PAP
tests free, he explained that
Cowell's budget could not handle
the cost of sending PAP smears to
the Palo Alto Clinic where they
are analyzed. The university
administration would not allot
any money for this purpose.
If the decision to charge for
PAP tests was purely economic,
then why did the university
withhold money from this one

particular service? Cowell refers
many other student cases it can't
handle to the Palo Alto Clinic.
When the Palo Alto Clinic does
the medical tests, the student is
not charged. When a woman has a
PAP test at Cowell without
receiving contraception, she is not
charged. Why this discrimination
against women who want to
exercise their right to control
their own bodies?
On the one hand we're told
that Cowell charges only for very
special cases that affect a tiny
minority of students—such as
allergy shots. On the other hand
we're told that we pay a fee
because such a large number of
women (about a thousand) have
come to Cowell for birth control.
Neither of these contradictory

answers justifies the $7.5 0 fee.
Women should not be treated as a
tiny, abnormal minority; and the
administration should realize that
birth control affects not just
women, but men too. Everyone
should share the burden.
The reason we're paying is that
in sexual relations between men
and women, women have always
paid: with guilty rejection from
society, dangerous abortions, or
the burden of unwanted children.
Now Stanford has modernized
this custom, and we can simply
"pay for our sins" in cash.
