It is not clear to me that
stopping Lodge from speaking, as
it was done, will help get the U.S.
out of South-east Asia.
At this moment it is very
difficult to judge what the
outcome of that action will be.
However, there is a precedent set
by denying chief architects of
American war policy access to
college campuses, which can—as in
the case of Lyndon Johnson—have
a beneficial effect. It can have a
favorable influence on national
opinion and, particularly, on
world opinion where our
"leaders' " prestige is lessened.
It can make it just a bit more
difficult for the U.S. to continue
present policy. It can make the
War present and palpable to the
American mind. I think it is
terribly important to keep
reminding people that the War is
still going on, that men like Lodge
help plan it. Sometimes disruptive
means are necessary. I am not,
however, certain this disruption
was handled correctly.
But the reason the Daily and
Lyman and Campbell and others
have moved to condemn the
disruption was not based on its
effect with respect to getting the
U.S. out of South-east Asia. The
Daily editorial implies that even if
the disruption were clearly
effective, it would still be bad.
Consideration of the War, it
asserts, is subordinate to what is
termed "free speech."
Obviously they do not regard
the shouting and boos as a form
of speech, certainly not "free."
Yet if the maximization of
freedom is, as Lyman avers,
listening "to the full exp, of
points of view which you regard

as sinful or disastrous or
catastrophic in their outcome,"
the disrupters, not Lodge, should
have been listened to.
They were, in that situation,
the exponents of a view that
many there regarded as "sinful"
or "disastrous." One must
remember that shouting and
booing as forms of free speech
have a long and respectable
tradition dating back to the Old
Testament. French factory
workers drowning out a speech by
Seguy with shouts and boos, in
France '68, is a more recent
example. If freedom is
catastrophic in its outcome for
Lyman, he should, by his own
assertion, listen to and permit the
disruptive form of "free speech."
The terminology is ambiguous.
Tuesday's Daily editorial suggests
that "freedom of speech" or "free
speech," as it is called, is anyone
openly, without impediment,
expressing an opinion. It follows,
then that there are many kinds of
"free speech."
There is Irving Schmaltz
howling wildly in the forest,
asking the trees embarrassing
questions. This form of free
speech has little to do with
freedom. There is Brooks Otis
lecturing to his class on an
exegesis of Homer. This usually
falls under the rubric of academic
free speech.
It may or may not relate to
freedom. There is Hitler haranguing
a crowd, urging it to burn down
CP headquarters or Mayor Daley
briefing his police force on what
to do at the convention, neither
of which have anything to do with
freedom. Or there is the Black in
Newark inciting others to riot,
which might directly relate to

freedom. This variety of tree
speech is usually outlawed in the
continental United States.
The ambiguities are inevitable if
free speech is ideologically
neutral. In fact if one separates
speech from the political—lrving
for example- it can never be free.
It is true that free speech, as the
Daily has defined it, may be a
necessary prerequisite to other
kinds of freedom. But violating
free speech, so defined, may also
be necessary. To be free "free
speech" cannot be neutral.
