# Government Surveillance Expanding
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
During the past year reports of
extensive government participation in
domestic spying have mushroomed.
Word of Army spies and defense
department data banks choak lull ol
names of possible subversives, have sent
civil libertarians squawking.

Government officials, embarrassed
by the disclosures, have been quick to
deny responsibility for the spying and
vociferous in their pledges to stop
much of it in the future. But the
reports continue.
The flowering of the "computer age"
coupled with the justification that

political violence and civil disorder
warrant the collection of information
concerning the private lives of
American citizens, has caused the
Government's date banks to swell with
the compilation of over 5 0 million
names.
The Government's information
gathering activities are concentrated on
the individuals and organizations which
are designated to be "left of center" in
the political spectrum. The Black
Fan tilers, the Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) and other
radical student organizations have been
closely watched.
Recently, former army intelligence
agents have revealed that they were
ordered to infiltrate a welfare mothers
demonstration in New York, a black
studies program at New York
University, the 1 968 Poor People's
March, Martin Luther King's funeral,
and Vietnam War Moratoriums held in
Washington, D.C., San Francisco, and
many colleges and universities.
Illinois
John M. O'Brien, a former military
intelligence officer, disclosed that
among the 8 00 Illinois citizens placed
under domestic surveillance were
senator Adlai Stevenson 111, former
Gov. Otto J. Kerner, now a federal
Appellate Court justice, and Rep.
Abner J. Mikva, D-111. Soon after this
disclosure, the Department of Defense
announced that such activity would be
dis-continued.
According to one ex-agent, Ralph M.
Stein of Flushing, N.Y., the expansion

of domestic surveillance can be traced
to the Detroit riot of 1 967. "It (the
riot) came as a big surprise," he said,
"and the intelligence officers got
uptight because they were unable to
answer all the questions of the
generals."
In 1 967-68 , Stein headed a
newly-established "left-wing desk," an
Army creation that was located in
Washington, D.C. and served as a
collection point for information about
radical activity. Stein acknowledged
that "most of our reports on the SDS
were forwarded to us by the FBI,
classified either confidential or secret.
The SDS was definitely infiltrated by
the FBI."
PLP Spy
One FBI undercover agent became a
member of the Progressive Labor Party,
a Maoist-oriented radical group, and
was eventually elected treasurer of the
Washington-Maryland branch of the
SDS. He later accompanied an SDS
delegation to Cuba.
Richard Kasson, a former Army
intelligence agent, and presently a
psychology student at the University of
Minnesota, said that his duties as an
agent were a product of an agreement
between the Army and the university
police department in which the
students and faculty were placed under
political surveillance. Although Kasson
was reasonably certain that University
officials had no knowledge of the
Army's actions, the military agents had
easy access to student files in the

offices of admissions and records and
employment.
In a recent article in the Minnesota
Daily, Kasson related, "We'd go up to
Admissions and Records, and push a
little buzzer behind the door and walk
right in. We knew the people and we'd
go ahead and give them a iist of names
that we wanted, get their files, and we
could review all their information, any
correspondence that they'd had with
the University, their transcripts and so
forth. Once the (military) liaison is
established with the University you
have pretty much free run of the
place."
Spying Here
Stanford has had two public
incidents which involved political
surveillance by law enforcement
officers. The first occurred last spring
when an unidentified Wilbur coed was
approached by Stanford police and
Santa Clara County Sheriff's deputies
for the purpose of aiding them in their
attempts to discover upcoming radical
activities.
Last quarter, Daily, reporter Phil
Revzin posing as a prospective
informant, contacted the FBI and was
assigned to report on radical activities.
Revzin and the girl eventually withdrew
from their assignments, and publicized
what they had entailed.
The revelation of wide-spread
domestic surveillance has inevitably
brought forth fervent accusations and
equally impassioned denials that the
individual's privacy is being invaded.

and that his constitutional rights have
been placed in jeopardy.
Erwin
Senator Sam J. Ervin, a conservative
Democrat from North Carolina, and
chairman cf the Subcommittee on
Constitutional Rights, has bellowed
countless words in protest of
government spying into the
Congressional Record, and has called
upon the Army to publicly detail the
extent of its massive surveillance
network.
"Mr. President," declared Ervin
recently, "no member of this body has
greater admiration for the Army than
does the senior senator from North
Carolina. No Member of this body has
supported to a higher degree the efforts
of the Army to keep itself ready to
defend this Nation against any threat
from abroad. But I am constrained to
say that spying upon the civilian
population is not a proper function of
the Army of the United States. It
cannot be condoned. It cannot be
tolerated."
The legal action which has been
taken against Government spying has so
far proven inconclusive. In Chicago, a
U.S. District Court judge two weeks
ago held that Army spying on civilians
Ls not a violation of constitutional
rights.
Court Test
Judge Richard B. Austin concluded
that "there is no question that the
executive branch has a right to use all

facilities available to try to adhere to
the oath to protect and defend the
Constitution from all enemies,
domestic and foreign."
There have been rulings critical of
some governmental spying, however.
Last week Los Angeles District Judge
Warren J. Fergusen countered a ruling
by Chicago's Justice Julius Hoffman.
He held that domestic wiretap
surveillance is unconstitutional if

conducted without a warrant evt.-n in
cases of national emergency.
"To guarantee political freedom,"
Fergusen maintained, "our forefathers
agreed to take certain risks which are
inherent in a free democracy.
"It is unthinkable that we should
now be required to sacrifice these
freedoms to defend them."
Tomorrow: Technology and
surveillance.
