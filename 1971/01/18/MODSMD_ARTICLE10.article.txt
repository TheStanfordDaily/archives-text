# Patients Receive Financial Advice
## 
### 
Stanford hospital is now
assigning staff members to look
after its patients' financial
complications, as well as their
physical ailments.
Role of the nine new employes,
who are called patient
representatives, is to provide each
patient and his family with
assistance on all financial matters
related to the hospital stay.
Before the new system was put
into effect, patients or family

members had to contact several
people regarding financial
arrangements.
Now all the business details of
admitting, credit checking,
insurance coverage, deposits, state
and federal health insurance, and
transferring to another medical
facility are handled centrally.
A thorough training program at
the hospital last year prepared the
nine representatives for the new
job.
