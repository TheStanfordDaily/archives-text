# Indians Scare UCLA
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
USC and UCLA's basketball
teams will meet on Friday night
February 6 th in the Los Angeles
Sports Arena. It should be quite a
contest.
The two top-ranked teams in
the country came north to play
Cal and Stanford this weekend,
and as expected they each won
twice.
Three out of the four wins were
decisive. But the game that
ed to be the biggest rout,
-d out to be the only close
est.
Jn Friday night, the UCLA
:uins came to Maples Pavilion to
iace a Stanford team which was
missing two of its better players,
senior guard Dennis O'Neill and
sophomore forward Bob Buell,
both of whom were sidelined with
injuries.
And yet this small, scrappy
Indian team took on a club with
possibly the best front line in
college basketball, and gave them
a remarkable battle.
Stanford came out playing a
slow-up game designed to bring
out the awesome UCLA front line
and it worked well for awhile. But
11 first half Stanford turnovers
gave the Bruins their chance and
they moved out to a 29-17
halftime lead.
But then something happened.
Claude Terry, Stanford's 6-5
junior guard, put on a shooting
display which was hard to believe.
With the Cards down 31-19,
Terry hit three straight jumpers,
all from at least 20' out. Then
another jumper from the corner, a

free throw, and another 22', and
Stanford trailed by only three,
34-31.
In the space of less than seven
minutes, Terry had scored 11
points and, believe it or not,
UCLA failed to score one field
goal during che same period. For a
UCLA team to go for eight
minutes and ten seconds without
a field goal is pretty amazing.
But finally, the Bruin front line
started to assert itself. 6-9 center
Steve Patterson hit two jumpers
and got a couple of tip ins. In
fact, 14 of UCLA's last 18 points
came on tip-ins or lay-ups.
Terry had finally cooled off,
and although 6-6 center Mike
Michel and forwards Pat Stevens
and Chuck Moore started to get
hot, Stanford couldn't overtake
the UCLAn's in the final minutes.
The game was over and UCLA
had won 58-53, but from the
reaction of the crowd, you might
have thought it had gone the
other way. A large majority of the
capacity crowd rose to its feet and
gave a Stanford team which had
outscored the Bruins 36-29 in the
second half, a standing ovation.
The Indians ended up shooting
62% for the second half and 5 7%
for the game. Terry led all scorers
with 22 points. 6-8 forward Sid
Wicks led UCLA with 19 points,
while Patterson had 12 points and
1 7 big rebounds.
Terry called it Stanford's best
game of the year, and UCLA
Coach John Wooden agree.
Wooden said, "I thought Stanford
played very well. For their size
they did the best job of

rebounding of any team we ve
faced this year.
"We knew Terry and Michel
were fine shooters, but 1 was
surprised at the excellend jobs
Michel and Stevens did on the
boards. They played a good ball
game against us."
But Saturday night, it was USC
who played the good game.
Stanford tried some of the same
spread-out offense, but an
extremely tenacious USC
man-to-man defense stymied the
Cards.
Stanford stayed close until
there were seven minutes to go in
the half, when USC's fast break
began to work. Led by speedy
guards Dennis Layton and Paul
Westphal, the Trojans ran off 15
straight points to lead at the half,
35-2 2.
The Trojans' fast-paced running
game continued to work in the
second half. And Stanford
couldn't get the hot shooting
necessary to overcome the zone
defense USC switched into. The
Cards never got closer than 11
points and USC coasted to a
71-51 win.
Terry led all scorers once again
with 17 points. Layton and
Westphal each had 14, but their
ball handling and direction of
USC's remarkable fast break made
the difference in the game. USC
also ended up hitting on 48% of
thier shots, while Stanford could
only connect on 34% of their
attempts, a bit less accurate than
on Friday night.
Naturally Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar was asked to
compare the two teams. He had
praise for both of them, but he
said the deciding factor in their
games would probably be UCLA's
front line.
On the baas of only the two
Stanford games, one had to be
more impressed with the Trojans.
But anyone who saw UCLA beat
Cal on TV, 94-76, saw the Bruins
playing as they should. Wicks
scored 33 points and had 17
rebounds in one of the greatest
performances a college forward
has ever had. When the Trojans
(14-0) and the Bruins (13-0) do
meet in three weeks, it should be
a great battle.
One final encouraging note.
Stanford's big and talented
freshmen team ran their record to
7-0 with a 68-58 win over De
Anza Junior College, and a 6 3-55
win over City College of San
Francisco.
For the two games, the little
Indians front line combined for
90 points and 5 6 rebounds.
Forwards Steve Shupe (6-6) and
Jim Helbush (6-7) had 34 and 30
points, and 23 and 17 rebounds
respectively. 6-8 center Mike
Mann added 26 points and 16
rebounds.
Stanford entertains the
University of Utah next Saturday
night at 8:00 p.m.

overcome.

thier shots, while Stanford could
only connect on 34% of their
attempts, a bit less accurate than
on Friday night.
Naturally Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar was asked to
compare the two teams. He had
praise for both of them, but he
said the deciding factor in their
games would probably be UCLA's
front line.
On the baas of only the two
Stanford games, one had to be
more impressed with the Trojans.
But anyone who saw UCLA beat
Cal on TV, 94-76, saw the Bruins
playing as they should. Wicks
scored 33 points and had 17
rebounds in one of the greatest
performances a college forward
has ever had. When the Trojans
(14-0) and the Bruins (13-0) do
meet in three weeks, it should be
a great battle.
One final encouraging note.
Stanford's big and talented
freshmen team ran their record to
7-0 with a 68-58 win over De
Anza Junior College, and a 6 3-55
win over City College of San
Francisco.
For the two games, the little
Indians front line combined for
90 points and 5 6 rebounds.
Forwards Steve Shupe (6-6) and
Jim Helbush (6-7) had 34 and 30
points, and 23 and 17 rebounds
respectively. 6-8 center Mike
Mann added 26 points and 16
rebounds.

DOWN HE COMES—UCLA's stellar forward Sid Wicks comes down
with another rebound as Steve Patterson (3 2), Claude Terry (25),
Chuck Moore (33), (Pat Rusco (2 3),) and Terry Schofield (4 3) look
on. Terry put on quite a shooting display as he tanked 2 2 points, but
the height of UCLA's front line proved too much for the Indians to
overcome.
USC and UCLA's basketball
teams will meet on Friday night
February 6 th in the Los Angeles
Sports Arena. It should be quite a
contest.
The two top-ranked teams in
the country came north to play
Cal and Stanford this weekend,
and as expected they each won
twice.
Three out of the four wins were
decisive. But the game that
ed to be the biggest rout,
-d out to be the only close
est.
Jn Friday night, the UCLA
:uins came to Maples Pavilion to
iace a Stanford team which was
missing two of its better players,
senior guard Dennis O'Neill and
sophomore forward Bob Buell,
both of whom were sidelined with
injuries.
And yet this small, scrappy
Indian team took on a club with
possibly the best front line in
college basketball, and gave them
a remarkable battle.
Stanford came out playing a
slow-up game designed to bring
out the awesome UCLA front line
and it worked well for awhile. But
11 first half Stanford turnovers
gave the Bruins their chance and
they moved out to a 29-17
halftime lead.
But then something happened.
Claude Terry, Stanford's 6-5
junior guard, put on a shooting
display which was hard to believe.
With the Cards down 31-19,
Terry hit three straight jumpers,
all from at least 20' out. Then
another jumper from the corner, a

free throw, and another 22', and
Stanford trailed by only three,
34-31.
In the space of less than seven
minutes, Terry had scored 11
points and, believe it or not,
UCLA failed to score one field
goal during che same period. For a
UCLA team to go for eight
minutes and ten seconds without
a field goal is pretty amazing.
But finally, the Bruin front line
started to assert itself. 6-9 center
Steve Patterson hit two jumpers
and got a couple of tip ins. In
fact, 14 of UCLA's last 18 points
came on tip-ins or lay-ups.
Terry had finally cooled off,
and although 6-6 center Mike
Michel and forwards Pat Stevens
and Chuck Moore started to get
hot, Stanford couldn't overtake
the UCLAn's in the final minutes.
The game was over and UCLA
had won 58-53, but from the
reaction of the crowd, you might
have thought it had gone the
other way. A large majority of the
capacity crowd rose to its feet and
gave a Stanford team which had
outscored the Bruins 36-29 in the
second half, a standing ovation.
The Indians ended up shooting
62% for the second half and 5 7%
for the game. Terry led all scorers
with 22 points. 6-8 forward Sid
Wicks led UCLA with 19 points,
while Patterson had 12 points and
1 7 big rebounds.
Terry called it Stanford's best
game of the year, and UCLA
Coach John Wooden agree.
Wooden said, "I thought Stanford
played very well. For their size
they did the best job of

rebounding of any team we ve
faced this year.
"We knew Terry and Michel
were fine shooters, but 1 was
surprised at the excellend jobs
Michel and Stevens did on the
boards. They played a good ball
game against us."
But Saturday night, it was USC
who played the good game.
Stanford tried some of the same
spread-out offense, but an
extremely tenacious USC
man-to-man defense stymied the
Cards.
Stanford stayed close until
there were seven minutes to go in
the half, when USC's fast break
began to work. Led by speedy
guards Dennis Layton and Paul
Westphal, the Trojans ran off 15
straight points to lead at the half,
35-2 2.
The Trojans' fast-paced running
game continued to work in the
second half. And Stanford
couldn't get the hot shooting
necessary to overcome the zone
defense USC switched into. The
Cards never got closer than 11
points and USC coasted to a
71-51 win.
Terry led all scorers once again
with 17 points. Layton and
Westphal each had 14, but their
ball handling and direction of
USC's remarkable fast break made
the difference in the game. USC
also ended up hitting on 48% of
thier shots, while Stanford could
only connect on 34% of their
attempts, a bit less accurate than

Terry had finally cooled off,
and although 6-6 center Mike
Michel and forwards Pat Stevens
and Chuck Moore started to get
hot, Stanford couldn't overtake
the UCLAn's in the final minutes.
The game was over and UCLA
had won 58-53, but from the
reaction of the crowd, you might
have thought it had gone the
other way. A large majority of the
capacity crowd rose to its feet and
gave a Stanford team which had
outscored the Bruins 36-29 in the
second half, a standing ovation.
The Indians ended up shooting
62% for the second half and 5 7%
for the game. Terry led all scorers
with 22 points. 6-8 forward Sid
Wicks led UCLA with 19 points,
while Patterson had 12 points and
1 7 big rebounds.
Terry called it Stanford's best
game of the year, and UCLA
Coach John Wooden agree.
Wooden said, "I thought Stanford
played very well. For their size
they did the best job of

rebounding of any team we ve
faced this year.
"We knew Terry and Michel
were fine shooters, but 1 was
surprised at the excellend jobs
Michel and Stevens did on the
boards. They played a good ball
game against us."
But Saturday night, it was USC
who played the good game.
Stanford tried some of the same
spread-out offense, but an
extremely tenacious USC
man-to-man defense stymied the
Cards.
Stanford stayed close until
there were seven minutes to go in
the half, when USC's fast break
began to work. Led by speedy
guards Dennis Layton and Paul
Westphal, the Trojans ran off 15
straight points to lead at the half,
35-2 2.
The Trojans' fast-paced running
game continued to work in the
second half. And Stanford
couldn't get the hot shooting
necessary to overcome the zone
defense USC switched into. The
Cards never got closer than 11
points and USC coasted to a
71-51 win.
Terry led all scorers once again
with 17 points. Layton and
Westphal each had 14, but their
ball handling and direction of
USC's remarkable fast break made
the difference in the game. USC
also ended up hitting on 48% of
thier shots, while Stanford could
only connect on 34% of their
attempts, a bit less accurate than
on Friday night.
Naturally Stanford coach
Howie Dallmar was asked to
compare the two teams. He had
praise for both of them, but he
said the deciding factor in their
games would probably be UCLA's
front line.
On the baas of only the two
Stanford games, one had to be
more impressed with the Trojans.
But anyone who saw UCLA beat
Cal on TV, 94-76, saw the Bruins
playing as they should. Wicks
scored 33 points and had 17
rebounds in one of the greatest
performances a college forward
has ever had. When the Trojans
(14-0) and the Bruins (13-0) do
meet in three weeks, it should be
a great battle.
One final encouraging note.
Stanford's big and talented
freshmen team ran their record to
7-0 with a 68-58 win over De
Anza Junior College, and a 6 3-55
win over City College of San
Francisco.
For the two games, the little
Indians front line combined for
90 points and 5 6 rebounds.
Forwards Steve Shupe (6-6) and
Jim Helbush (6-7) had 34 and 30
points, and 23 and 17 rebounds
respectively. 6-8 center Mike
Mann added 26 points and 16
rebounds.

with another rebound as Steve Patterson (3 2), Claude Terry (25),
Chuck Moore (33), (Pat Rusco (2 3),) and Terry Schofield (4 3) look
on. Terry put on quite a shooting display as he tanked 2 2 points, but
the height of UCLA's front line proved too much for the Indians to
overcome.
USC and UCLA's basketball
teams will meet on Friday night
February 6 th in the Los Angeles
Sports Arena. It should be quite a
contest.
The two top-ranked teams in
the country came north to play
Cal and Stanford this weekend,
and as expected they each won
twice.
Three out of the four wins were
decisive. But the game that
ed to be the biggest rout,
-d out to be the only close
est.
Jn Friday night, the UCLA
:uins came to Maples Pavilion to
iace a Stanford team which was
missing two of its better players,
senior guard Dennis O'Neill and
sophomore forward Bob Buell,
both of whom were sidelined with
injuries.
And yet this small, scrappy
Indian team took on a club with
possibly the best front line in
college basketball, and gave them
a remarkable battle.
Stanford came out playing a
slow-up game designed to bring
out the awesome UCLA front line
and it worked well for awhile. But
11 first half Stanford turnovers
gave the Bruins their chance and
they moved out to a 29-17
halftime lead.
But then something happened.
Claude Terry, Stanford's 6-5
junior guard, put on a shooting
display which was hard to believe.
With the Cards down 31-19,
Terry hit three straight jumpers,
all from at least 20' out. Then
another jumper from the corner, a

free throw, and another 22', and
Stanford trailed by only three,
34-31.
In the space of less than seven
minutes, Terry had scored 11
points and, believe it or not,
UCLA failed to score one field
goal during che same period. For a
UCLA team to go for eight
minutes and ten seconds without
a field goal is pretty amazing.
But finally, the Bruin front line
started to assert itself. 6-9 center
Steve Patterson hit two jumpers
and got a couple of tip ins. In
fact, 14 of UCLA's last 18 points
came on tip-ins or lay-ups.
Terry had finally cooled off,
and although 6-6 center Mike

with another rebound as Steve Patterson (3 2), Claude Terry (25),
Chuck Moore (33), (Pat Rusco (2 3),) and Terry Schofield (4 3) look
on. Terry put on quite a shooting display as he tanked 2 2 points, but
the height of UCLA's front line proved too much for the Indians to
overcome.
