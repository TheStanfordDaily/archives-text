# Swimmers Smash Two Oregon Foes
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford swam through Oregon
last weekend and left both Oregon
and Oregon State floundering in
their wake.
The Indians dunked the Beavers
8 7-26 and surprised Oregon
83-30. Against Oregon State, the
Tribe was able to mix up the
line-up throughout the meet.
Stanford captured blue ribbons in
every event at Corvallis.
Starring for Coach Jim
Gaughran's aquanauts on Friday
was diver Ted Nichols. Nichols
qualified for the NCAA
championships in the one-meter
competition with a score of
293.70.
Brian Job was a triple winner
for the day. Job won the 200
breaststroke in 2:11.1 and the
266 yard individual medley. He
also led off on the victorious 200
freestyle relay.
Double Winners
Seven swimmers were double
winners against the hapless
Beavers. Nichols won both the
one and three-meter diving. John
Ferris finished first in the 66 yard
free and the 500 free.
In the relays, Stanford captured
the 200 freestyle relay with Job,
Dave Shilling, Rick Longinotti,
and Ray Collins. The medley relay
won with Fred Haywood, Shilling,
Martin Pedley, and Steve Carey.
Haywood coasted to triumph in

the 200 backstroke while
Longinotti bested the competition
in the 200 butterfly.
Pedley captured the 100 free
with Rick Eagleston finishing
second. Collins was first followed
by Bert Mason in the 200 free.

Coach Gaughran said, "It
wasn't a hard weekend in Oregon.
The times are improving and the
team is coming along. We beat
them both worse than we wanted
to."
Gaughran was most impressed
with his breaststroke is the best
recorded thus far this season in
the nation. Dave Shilling's 2:10.6
second-place time may have been
the second best time in the nation
to date.
