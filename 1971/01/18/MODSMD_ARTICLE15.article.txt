# Activist Linked To Cache
## 
### 
One of the names linked to the large
cache of explosives found in the Santa
Cruz mountains last Friday appears to
be Stuart Mcßae, a former Stanford
student and leftist.
The one-time head of the Stanford
vledical Aid Committee was
subpoenaed to testify about the group's
work before the House Committee on
Un-American activities in August 1 966.
Mcßae had collected blood and money
donations for the Red Cross to
distribute to war victims through the
North Vietnam Red Cross and NLF
agencies.
Protesting the HUAC subpoena,
Mcßae bitterly argued with the
committee leadership and at one point
refused to answer a question "on the
grounds that it nauseates me and I am
liable to vomit all over this table."
He later testified that he had
collected "somewhere over $300 " and

had forwarded the sum to the Red
Cross.
In his appearance Mcßae angrilly
denounced HUAC a s
''unconstitutional" and
"un-American." He added "I have a
responsibility to stand up to this
committee and to out against its
transparent effort to intimidate
resistance to the war."
The committee was ostensibly
investigating aid to "enemies of the
U.S. in time of undeclared war."
On Friday the San Mateo County
District Attorney's office received a tip
from an informant about the location
of the cache. Officers investigated the
scene and found large amounts of
dynamite, plastic explosives and
detonation devices in two cabins on a
20 acre parcel of land owned by Mcßae
and Robert E. Stege of East Palo Alto.
Stege's address was formerly an
anti-draft commune.
