McGovern To Run
WASHINGTON — Sen. George S. McGovern of South
Dabota, challenging the odds and the polls, announces
formally Monday his candidacy for the 1 972 Democratic
presidential nomination.
His formal announcement will be in the form of a
letter to more than 3,000 newspaper editors, declaring a
candidacy which has been obvious for more than a year.
McGovern plans to follow that up with a 15 minute
broadcast address to his South Dakota constituents,
from Sioux Falls, Monday afternoon.
In addition, he is sending a letter which couples an
announcement of candidacy and an appeal for political
and financial support to more than 275 ,000 Democrats
across the nation.
It is all part of a head start effort to overcome the
lead McGovern concedes Sen. Edmund S. Muskie of

Maine now holds over the well populated field of
prospects for the Democratic nomination.
McGovern upstaged himself with a speech Thursday
night in Shippensburg, Pa., announcing that he intends
to enter the major presidential primaries. His speech at
Shippensburg State Teachers College amounted to an
advance announcement of his candidacy.
Speaker Bid Made
WASHINGTON — Rep. John Conyers, a black liberal
Democrat from Detroit, says he will challenge Rep. Carl
Albert of Oklahoma for the office of speaker of the
House.
Conyers' office said he plans to announce his
challenge Monday for the post because Albert, the man
in line to the speaker, "refuses to give leadership in the
challenge against the Mississippi congressmen."
