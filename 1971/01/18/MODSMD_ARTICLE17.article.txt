# 'Los Siete' Charges Protested
## 
### 
REDWOOD ClTY—Arraignment of
Los Siete on charges of armed robbery
and ear theft was postponed Friday
morning at a rowdy hearing attended
by more than 200 radical supporters.
The demonstrators were protesting the
charges against the seven Latino
youths, who were acquitted in
November of murder in a controversial
shoot-out with two San Fransicso
police officers.
One demonstrator, .Jeffrey
Youdelman, an English instructor at
Stanford, was arrested for resisting
arrest when police broke up a scuffle
involving Youdelm&n and a police TV
cameraman. Later in the morning a
police car was trashed by several
radicals who suspected police were
using it to photograph the crowd.
At the short hearing, visiting Judge
Paul I. Myers of Palo Alto deferred a
decision on the Los Siete defense
motion that charges against the seven
be dropped. They are accused of
stealing a car in San Mateo County
following the Mission District gun fight
with the S. F. officers. Municipal Judge
Roy W. Seagraves will rule on the
motion on January 25 .
A group of thirty police in full riot
gear were present at the rally to handle
the crowd. Police allowed
demonstrators into the court house

through a single door, one at a time,
and made a careful search of each
person. Other police with cameras and
guns watched from nearby rooftops.
Following the hearing, defendant
Rudolpho Martinez told the crowd
they "must not think that it is a
one-time shot to support us, nor is ours
an isolated example of political
frameups."
Martinez was referring to the arrest
early Thursday morning in San
Francisco of defendant Jose Rios on
charges of assault with intent to
commit murder, resisting arrest,
possession of stolen property, and
possession of a loaded gun. Police

claimed that when they stopped to
investigate an illegally parked car, Rios
and companion Michael Georgopulos
tried to run away from the auto. Both
were subdued and taken into custody.
Imprisoned for more than a year and
a half before and during their trial, Los
Siete became a symbol of growing
chicano militantcy. In the 17-week
trial, the defense proved that none of
the defendants were responsible for the
death of officer Joseph Brodnik. Los
Siete maintained that officer Paul
McGoran had drawn his guduring a
scuffle with the youths and had
accidently shot Brodnik.

youths, who were acquitted in
November of murder in a controversial
shoot-out with two San Fransicso
police officers.
One demonstrator, .Jeffrey
Youdelman, an English instructor at
Stanford, was arrested for resisting
arrest when police broke up a scuffle
involving Youdelm&n and a police TV
cameraman. Later in the morning a
police car was trashed by several
radicals who suspected police were
using it to photograph the crowd.
At the short hearing, visiting Judge
Paul I. Myers of Palo Alto deferred a
decision on the Los Siete defense
motion that charges against the seven
be dropped. They are accused of
stealing a car in San Mateo County
following the Mission District gun fight
with the S. F. officers. Municipal Judge
Roy W. Seagraves will rule on the
motion on January 25 .
A group of thirty police in full riot
gear were present at the rally to handle
the crowd. Police allowed
demonstrators into the court house

through a single door, one at a time,
and made a careful search of each
person. Other police with cameras and
guns watched from nearby rooftops.
Following the hearing, defendant
Rudolpho Martinez told the crowd
they "must not think that it is a
one-time shot to support us, nor is ours
an isolated example of political
frameups."
Martinez was referring to the arrest
early Thursday morning in San
Francisco of defendant Jose Rios on
charges of assault with intent to
commit murder, resisting arrest,
possession of stolen property, and
possession of a loaded gun. Police

claimed that when they stopped to
investigate an illegally parked car, Rios
and companion Michael Georgopulos
tried to run away from the auto. Both
were subdued and taken into custody.
Imprisoned for more than a year and
a half before and during their trial, Los
Siete became a symbol of growing
chicano militantcy. In the 17-week
trial, the defense proved that none of
the defendants were responsible for the
death of officer Joseph Brodnik. Los
Siete maintained that officer Paul
McGoran had drawn his guduring a
scuffle with the youths and had
accidently shot Brodnik.
