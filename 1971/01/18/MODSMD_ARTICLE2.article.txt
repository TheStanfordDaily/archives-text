# Pass-Fail Abuses Growing
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Courses taken by undergraduates for
a "pass" grade have almost doubled
since most restrictions on"pass-no
credit" grading were eliminated this
year. But administrators are trying to
correct what they term "abuses" of the
pass option.
Over 1,10 0 pass grades were
recorded for this fall, according to
Assistant Registrar Robert Kauffman.
Last fall about 2,100 passes were
reported. In addition, there were about
150 "fails" in pass-fail courses.
The increase followed elimination in
September of a one-per-quarter limit
and a total of 27 pass-fail units allowed
per student. The only remaining
restrictions come from particular
professors who refuse to give pass-no
credit grades and departments requiring
conventional grades for courses in a
major.
Pass-fail grading began at
Stanford in 1966 and actually became
"pass-no credit" this fall when the

University stopped recording failing
grades. But as the pass option caught
on, so did alleged abuses.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Doug Davis said, "We're at the
point where we have to do something
quickly ... to preserve some integrity
for the pass."
Davis said a prime abuser is the
"grade shopper." Rather than use the
pass-option as an alternative to
competitive grading, the "grade
shopper" takes a pass once he discovers
he is getting a poor grade in the regular
system.
Davis pointed to students who turn
in finals with a note requesting they be
given a pass if their course grade is less
than a "B".
While in previous years such students
avoided a "D" or "F", elimination of
failing marks has made "C" the
stigmatized grade.
Davis said the "grade shopper" gives
the pass the connotation of a grade no
better than "C". To fight that abuse, a

deadline on declaring the pass option
will be set midway in the quarter
beginning this spring. "The earlier you
declare a pass-no pass option, the more
legitimate it is," according to Davis.
Another problem comes from
differing interpretations of the effort
required for a pass grade. Mechanical
Engineering Professor William
Reynolds, a member of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS), said
students and faculty should be
reminded that a "pass is a reasonable
performance, not one that's just
marginal."
A University policy states: "The pass
option in no way implies less or
different course requirements than
those required of students taking the
coursc for a letter grade."
The problems of minimum standards
for a pass will apparently be discussed
in a letter on pass grading which Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
is now writing.
Another revision of the pass system
will benefit students taking the
increasing number of courses which
professors offer only on a pass-no
credit basis. By next year, such courses
will be marked in the Time Schedule to
warn students in advance. And pass
grades received in such mandatory
pass-no credit classes will be specially
marked on transcripts. Davis explained.

IT'S GREAT TO BE A TROJANâ€” Every Stanford student has his excuse for suffering through basketball at Maples. For
some it's Sidney Wicks, for others it's Claude Terry. A lot of people just go for the halftime show, and they weren't
disappointed Saturday night. Above, "Rent a Turkey" (Tommy Trojan) does his thing.
"They'll be marked on the transcript so
that graduate schools will know there
was no option for the student."
Because 85 percent of Stanford
undergraduates go on to graduate
schools, students and administrators are
worried about how graduate schools
interpret passes on a transcript.
Davis warned that as students use the
pass to "bail them out" of "C's,"
graduate admissions offices are
increasingly equating it with a
"C"-performance. "Graduate people
are skeptical because they know
students well enough to know what's
go t ig on."

He said some schools actually count
thorn as "C's" or "ignore them and
look at the rest of the transcript."
But Davis also suggested "judicious
use" of pass options can impress
graduate schools. He said they are
receptive to pass grades used for the
original purpose of "encouraging
students to take courses outside of
their area." The engineer who takes a
creative writing course for a pass and
the writer taking math are examples.
Davis explained the graduate schools
"want to see a core of graded classes
that constitute a direction of the
student's education."
Under that interpretation, most

departments are hesitant to allow
pass-no credit grading for majors. At
one extreme, the psychology
department allows pass options in ail
required courses. At another end, the
history department allow no passes for
majors. In between, the engineering
department allows area requirements to
be taken for a pass with special
permission.
The English department now allows
any two courses for the major to be
taken on a pass basis. But a
departmental statement warned,
"Students intending to go to graduate
school should weigh the fact that a
grade of pass will provide little evidence
of their abilities."
Dean of Graduate Studies Lincoln
Moses said increasing use of pass grades
by schools throughout the country
"makes the job less comfortable" for
graduate school admissions offices. But
he said most schools "are cooperating
with the inevitable."
The reaction to pass-option also
seems to depend on the graduate field
involved. Assistant Dean Gary Williams
of the Business School said, "Most
major business schools do not really get
very concerned about pass-fails."
But Law Professor Wayne Barnett
said major law schools place "negative
implications" on pass grades. He said he
was "shocked" to hear of theories that
passes could be viewed as positive signs
of a student taking courses outside his
normal field.
Barnett commented, "The only
rational response is to downgrade the
course that has a pass-fail on it on the
assumption that students have devoted
more work to the graded courses."
