# Pass-Fail Abuses Growing
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Courses taken by undergraduates for
a "pass" grade have almost doubled
since most restrictions on"pass-no
credit" grading were eliminated this
year. But administrators are trying to
correct what they term "abuses" of the
pass option.
Over 1,10 0 pass grades were
recorded for this fall, according to
Assistant Registrar Robert Kauffman.
Last fall about 2,100 passes were
reported. In addition, there were about
150 "fails" in pass-fail courses.
The increase followed elimination in
September of a one-per-quarter limit
and a total of 27 pass-fail units allowed
per student. The only remaining
restrictions come from particular
professors who refuse to give pass-no
credit grades and departments requiring
conventional grades for courses in a
major.
Pass-fail grading began at
Stanford in 1966 and actually became
"pass-no credit" this fall when the

University stopped recording failing
grades. But as the pass option caught
on, so did alleged abuses.
Associate Dean of Undergraduate
Studies Doug Davis said, "We're at the
point where we have to do something
quickly ... to preserve some integrity
for the pass."
Davis said a prime abuser is the
"grade shopper." Rather than use the
pass-option as an alternative to
competitive grading, the "grade
shopper" takes a pass once he discovers
he is getting a poor grade in the regular
system.
Davis pointed to students who turn
in finals with a note requesting they be
given a pass if their course grade is less
than a "B".
While in previous years such students
avoided a "D" or "F", elimination of
failing marks has made "C" the
stigmatized grade.
Davis said the "grade shopper" gives
the pass the connotation of a grade no
better than "C". To fight that abuse, a

deadline on declaring the pass option
will be set midway in the quarter
beginning this spring. "The earlier you
declare a pass-no pass option, the more
legitimate it is," according to Davis.
Another problem comes from
differing interpretations of the effort
required for a pass grade. Mechanical
Engineering Professor William
Reynolds, a member of the Committee
on Undergraduate Studies (CUS), said
students and faculty should be
reminded that a "pass is a reasonable
performance, not one that's just
marginal."
A University policy states: "The pass
option in no way implies less or
different course requirements than
those required of students taking the
coursc for a letter grade."
The problems of minimum standards
for a pass will apparently be discussed
in a letter on pass grading which Dean
of Undergraduate Studies James Gibbs
is now writing.
Another revision of the pass system
will benefit students taking the
increasing number of courses which
professors offer only on a pass-no
credit basis. By next year, such courses
will be marked in the Time Schedule to
warn students in advance. And pass
grades received in such mandatory
pass-no credit classes will be specially
marked on transcripts. Davis explained.

IT'S GREAT TO BE A TROJAN— Every Stanford student has his excuse for suffering through basketball at Maples. For
some it's Sidney Wicks, for others it's Claude Terry. A lot of people just go for the halftime show, and they weren't
disappointed Saturday night. Above, "Rent a Turkey" (Tommy Trojan) does his thing.
