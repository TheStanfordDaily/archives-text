# Planes Renew Attacks Over North Vietnam

SAIGON (AP) - U.S.
fighter-bombers attacked two
surface-to-air SAM missile sites in
North Vietnam on Sunday, the U.S.
Command reported. It was the third
straight day of "protective reaction"
strikes inside North Vietnam's borders.
Spokesmen said a pair of Air Force
FlO5 jets escorting 852 bombers on
raids along the Laos-North Vietnamese
border fired three radar-bombing
Shrike missiles at two radar controlled
SAM sites, with unknown results.
The U.S. Command said one site was
located 1 \ miles from the Laotian
border and 1 fi miles north of the
demilitarized /one between the two
Vietnams, the other 1 7 miles from Laos
and 4 6 miles north of the /one.
American pilots said they did not see
any SAM's fired at the U.S. air raft.
But they said the enemy radar had
locked onto the planes and was
tracking them in preparation for firing,
thus posing an imminent threat.
The command says B5 2's flying
along the Laotian-North Vietnamese

border have encountered SAM's fired
from inside North Vietnam several
times during the past several months.
But none of the B5 2's has been hit.
More than 70 strikes have been made
against sites in North Vietnam since the
bombing of North Vietnam was halted
Nov. 1, 196H, including eight in the
past 1 0 days. The command calls them
"protective reaction" in keeping with
"the inherent right of self-defense."
The command said two U.S.
helicopters were shot down Sunday in
South Vietnam. A chopper on a
medical evacuation mission went down
in Chau Doc Province 1 20 miles west of
Saigon and about five miles from the
Cambodian border, killing one
American and wounding three. One
crewman was wounded in the downing
of an OH6 light observation craft in the
northern quarter of the country.
In the Cambodian conflict,
authoritative sources and field
dispatches indicate the United States
has increased its direct involvement in
the fighting with Navy support ships,
Army helicopters and liaison personnel.
