# Alaska Pipeline—Boon Or Bane?
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Alaska's North Slope is a vast wilderness of tundra grasses, sedges and lichens. It
has caribou, snowy owls, lemmings, wolves, seals, walruses, polar bears and grizzly
bears.
It also has oil, and recent development of the North Slope's oil deposits have
posed a serious threat to its continued existence as wilderness.
The most recent project to turn the North Slope into the "Kuwait of the
Arctic," has been the plan to build an 8 00 mile pipeline from the North Slope to
Valdez, the nearest deep-water port.
A recent Interior Department staff report approved the plan, claiming that the
nation needed the oil.
The report, however, admitted that the pipeline will disturb the Alaskan
ecology in do/.ens of ways, and created specific stipulations to be followed in
building the billion dollar pipeline to minimize the environmental damage.
What will be the environmental damage and why is the pipeline necessary?
Foremost among the environmental difficulty the pipeline may create are
those arising from thawing of the permafrost.
The permafrost is a permanently frozen layer of subsoil.
To enable the oil to flow to Valdez from the North Slope in midwinter Alaskan
style, it will be necessary to heat the oil to a temperature of 176 degrees
Fahrenheit.
If the pipeline is buried as was planned, it would melt the permafrost around it.
The melting of the permafrost could result in localized erosion and siltation of
streams.
Erosion is not. the only ecological problem. The pipeline must pass through at
least two fault zones, both potentially active.
Furthermore, even barring natural catastrophe, as anyone who lives in Santa
Barbara can tell you, oil can spill. In 1 968 alone, there were 5 00 oil pipeline leaks
in the U.S. involving over fifty barrels of oil. About ten of those spills were
between one thousand and ten thousand barrels.
These spills were only from pipes having a twenty inch or less diameter. The
envisioned Alaska pipeline would have a diameter of 48 inches, the largest pipeline
ever. It will he carrying 500,000 gallons of oil per mile of pipe at capacity.
Clearly, a spill could wreak havoc with the environment, the consequences being
far more terrible than some greasy beaches in Santa Barbara.
Thus the question arises,"lf there are all of these environmental hazards, why is
this pipeline necessary?"
Croups such as the Sierra Club maintain that it actually isn't necessary.
The Interior Department says, however, that it is a matter of national security.
"Development of the petroleum reserves of the North Slope of Alaska is
essential to the strength, gowth, and security of the United States," the Interior
Department report states.
The North Slope oil deposits appear essential if, as Assistant Secretary of the

Interior Hollis Dole told a Stanford audience last Tuesday, "the U.S. is going to
require (by 1 985 )—at the very least—almost double the amount of energy it used
last year to heat its homes, power its factories, mines and transportation systems,
and in general to accomplish the work that must go on in a large industrialized
consumption economy."
The vast oil resources on the North Slope would be necessary to keep the
United States with a fairly reliable fuel supply. The political instability of the
Middle East makes dependence upon imported oil very undesirable.
Thus, the pipeline appears desirable based on projected growth figures for fuel
consumption and the U.S. desire to rely for most of its fuel on sources within its
own borders. »
However, it is a sign of hope that the Interior Department has prepared two
thick volumes of stipulations to be followed in building the pipeline. These
include plans for coping with oil spills, a performance bond, and construction
designs which take into account stress from possible earthquakes, land erosion,
and subadence, among others.
The Alaskan government has been very impatient with the Interior
Department's delay in granting the permit, while it investigates possible
environmental damage.
Alaskan impatience with federal concern over the pipeline and its
environmental implications is perhaps best displayed in a speech by Sen. Ted
Stevens, appointed by former governor Walter Hick el. Said Stevens, "Alaskans

News Analysis

know Alaska. I'm fed up to hero with people who try to tell us how to develop
our country." As for the proposed Interior Department stipulations, he called
them, "stupid, absolutely stupid."
But the question of the Alaskan environment is one which goes beyond one
pipeline. For after the pipeline will come other pipelines and further development
of the wilderness. A firm has already indicated that it wants to put in a pipeline
from the North Slope into Canada. Humble Oil has begun investigating the
possibilities of a port for supertankers on Hershel island which would require
another two-hundred-mile pipeline.
What is needed is a land planning and classification system which would permit
a rational development of the state's great natural resources and virgin wilderness.
This would he far better than what appears to be the present laissez-faire land
development policy with short run economic gain as its only goal.
Walter Hickel, while Secretary of the Interior, proposed a p ' -'am of land
classification for the area, but now that Mr. Hickel has left, the program is in
trouble

know Alaska. I'm fed up to hero with people who try to tell us how to develop
our country." As for the proposed Interior Department stipulations, he called
them, "stupid, absolutely stupid."
But the question of the Alaskan environment is one which goes beyond one
pipeline. For after the pipeline will come other pipelines and further development
of the wilderness. A firm has already indicated that it wants to put in a pipeline
from the North Slope into Canada. Humble Oil has begun investigating the
possibilities of a port for supertankers on Hershel island which would require
another two-hundred-mile pipeline.
What is needed is a land planning and classification system which would permit
a rational development of the state's great natural resources and virgin wilderness.
This would he far better than what appears to be the present laissez-faire land
development policy with short run economic gain as its only goal.
Walter Hickel, while Secretary of the Interior, proposed a p ' -'am of land
classification for the area, but now that Mr. Hickel has left, the program is in
trouble
Alaska's North Slope is a vast wilderness of tundra grasses, sedges and lichens. It
has caribou, snowy owls, lemmings, wolves, seals, walruses, polar bears and grizzly
bears.
It also has oil, and recent development of the North Slope's oil deposits have
posed a serious threat to its continued existence as wilderness.
The most recent project to turn the North Slope into the "Kuwait of the
Arctic," has been the plan to build an 8 00 mile pipeline from the North Slope to
Valdez, the nearest deep-water port.
A recent Interior Department staff report approved the plan, claiming that the
nation needed the oil.
The report, however, admitted that the pipeline will disturb the Alaskan
ecology in do/.ens of ways, and created specific stipulations to be followed in
building the billion dollar pipeline to minimize the environmental damage.
What will be the environmental damage and why is the pipeline necessary?
Foremost among the environmental difficulty the pipeline may create are
those arising from thawing of the permafrost.
The permafrost is a permanently frozen layer of subsoil.
To enable the oil to flow to Valdez from the North Slope in midwinter Alaskan
style, it will be necessary to heat the oil to a temperature of 176 degrees
Fahrenheit.
If the pipeline is buried as was planned, it would melt the permafrost around it.
The melting of the permafrost could result in localized erosion and siltation of
streams.
Erosion is not. the only ecological problem. The pipeline must pass through at
least two fault zones, both potentially active.
Furthermore, even barring natural catastrophe, as anyone who lives in Santa
Barbara can tell you, oil can spill. In 1 968 alone, there were 5 00 oil pipeline leaks
in the U.S. involving over fifty barrels of oil. About ten of those spills were
between one thousand and ten thousand barrels.
These spills were only from pipes having a twenty inch or less diameter. The
envisioned Alaska pipeline would have a diameter of 48 inches, the largest pipeline
ever. It will he carrying 500,000 gallons of oil per mile of pipe at capacity.
Clearly, a spill could wreak havoc with the environment, the consequences being
far more terrible than some greasy beaches in Santa Barbara.
Thus the question arises,"lf there are all of these environmental hazards, why is
this pipeline necessary?"
Croups such as the Sierra Club maintain that it actually isn't necessary.
The Interior Department says, however, that it is a matter of national security.
"Development of the petroleum reserves of the North Slope of Alaska is
essential to the strength, gowth, and security of the United States," the Interior
Department report states.
The North Slope oil deposits appear essential if, as Assistant Secretary of the

Interior Hollis Dole told a Stanford audience last Tuesday, "the U.S. is going to
require (by 1 985 )—at the very least—almost double the amount of energy it used
last year to heat its homes, power its factories, mines and transportation systems,
and in general to accomplish the work that must go on in a large industrialized
consumption economy."
The vast oil resources on the North Slope would be necessary to keep the
United States with a fairly reliable fuel supply. The political instability of the
Middle East makes dependence upon imported oil very undesirable.
Thus, the pipeline appears desirable based on projected growth figures for fuel
consumption and the U.S. desire to rely for most of its fuel on sources within its
own borders. »

between one thousand and ten thousand barrels.
These spills were only from pipes having a twenty inch or less diameter. The
envisioned Alaska pipeline would have a diameter of 48 inches, the largest pipeline
ever. It will he carrying 500,000 gallons of oil per mile of pipe at capacity.
Clearly, a spill could wreak havoc with the environment, the consequences being
far more terrible than some greasy beaches in Santa Barbara.
Thus the question arises,"lf there are all of these environmental hazards, why is
this pipeline necessary?"
Croups such as the Sierra Club maintain that it actually isn't necessary.
The Interior Department says, however, that it is a matter of national security.
"Development of the petroleum reserves of the North Slope of Alaska is
essential to the strength, gowth, and security of the United States," the Interior
Department report states.
The North Slope oil deposits appear essential if, as Assistant Secretary of the

Interior Hollis Dole told a Stanford audience last Tuesday, "the U.S. is going to
require (by 1 985 )—at the very least—almost double the amount of energy it used
last year to heat its homes, power its factories, mines and transportation systems,
and in general to accomplish the work that must go on in a large industrialized
consumption economy."
The vast oil resources on the North Slope would be necessary to keep the
United States with a fairly reliable fuel supply. The political instability of the
Middle East makes dependence upon imported oil very undesirable.
Thus, the pipeline appears desirable based on projected growth figures for fuel
consumption and the U.S. desire to rely for most of its fuel on sources within its
own borders. »
However, it is a sign of hope that the Interior Department has prepared two
thick volumes of stipulations to be followed in building the pipeline. These
include plans for coping with oil spills, a performance bond, and construction
designs which take into account stress from possible earthquakes, land erosion,
and subadence, among others.
The Alaskan government has been very impatient with the Interior
Department's delay in granting the permit, while it investigates possible
environmental damage.
Alaskan impatience with federal concern over the pipeline and its
environmental implications is perhaps best displayed in a speech by Sen. Ted
Stevens, appointed by former governor Walter Hick el. Said Stevens, "Alaskans

know Alaska. I'm fed up to hero with people who try to tell us how to develop
our country." As for the proposed Interior Department stipulations, he called
them, "stupid, absolutely stupid."
But the question of the Alaskan environment is one which goes beyond one
pipeline. For after the pipeline will come other pipelines and further development
of the wilderness. A firm has already indicated that it wants to put in a pipeline
from the North Slope into Canada. Humble Oil has begun investigating the
possibilities of a port for supertankers on Hershel island which would require
another two-hundred-mile pipeline.
What is needed is a land planning and classification system which would permit
a rational development of the state's great natural resources and virgin wilderness.
This would he far better than what appears to be the present laissez-faire land
development policy with short run economic gain as its only goal.
Walter Hickel, while Secretary of the Interior, proposed a p ' -'am of land
classification for the area, but now that Mr. Hickel has left, the program is in
trouble
