# free speech etc.
## Lessons Learned From Lodge 
### 
The Daily's columns and letters
in the past week have helped
many of us to reflect further
about "free speech," war protest,
and the role of the university. I
am prompted to try to sort out
some of the underlying questions
with which we all still need to
grapple.
1. Rachelle Marshall is right
that the "liberal" community
must be faulted for having done
nothing to express its moral
indignation at the kinds of
policies Mr. Lodge has approved
and sponsored in southeast Asia.
There ought to be ways to express
not disapproval over Lodge's
being adced to speak, but
disapproval of the position he
represents.
I
There could have been teach-ins
before and/or after the meeting,
massive picketing outside the
auditorium, or any number of
other devices that would have
made our point but would not
have denied other people the right
to hear a point of view with which
we disagreed.
We need to remember that evil
spreads not only when evil men
gain power, but also when other
men remain silent. And we also
need to remember that when
those who feel their cause is right
fight evil by repressive means,
they become transformed into the
likeness of what they are trying to
oppose.
2.1 believe that the air could be
cleared of a great deal of
misunderstanding if there were
agreement on some clearly
understood groundrules for public
appearances on campus. Perhaps
the university ought to stipulate
that anyone who speaks under its
auspices must be willing to open
himself to questioning, so that
there can be queries, challenges
and rebuttals, under some
well-defined procedures, to ensure
that there is a significant exchange
of opinion and not simply a
one-sided presentation.
Many formats would be
possible: a student panel selected
to represent a variety of
viewpoints, questions from the
floor relayed by a chairman able
to ensure that one point of view

does not monopolize the question
period, and so on.
3. Those who believe that
people such as Lodge do not have
a "right" to be heard, need to
ponder the implications of
introducing such a calculus onto
the university campus. Shall one
segment of the community
determine whom the rest shall
hear? According to one viewpoint,
Lodge cannot speak on campus
but Angela Davis can, McNamara
cannot but Rap Brown can,
Kissenger cannot but Castro can.
But what is to prevent another
segment from deciding to reverse
the calculus?
I would submit that the
university ought to be the place
open to both viewpoints. Two
years ago I had the privilege of
introducing Daniel Berrigan from
the very platform on which Lodge
was denied a hearing last week.
There are surely members of the
Stanford community who feel
that a convicted criminal should
not have the "right" to speak, but
no attempt was made to disrupt
Berrigan's presentation. Instead,
he was sharply questioned in the
discussion following the talk, and
all gained from the exchange,
which sharpened the issue of war
protest in an important way for
many who were present.
4. Some have argued that to
opt for "free speech" in the
fashion I am proposing is the
engage in a moral neutrality that
the times do not permit. I agree
with Mr. Melinkoff's thoughtful
point in Friday's Daily, that free
speech is not neutral, but from
that shared premise I draw a
different conclusion. It seems to
me that the concept of free
speech is indeed biased: it is
biased in the direction of truth. It
is based on the glorious and
precarious assumption that truth
can make it against error without
cheating, that if people are
confronted with truth and error
they can, if they choose, opt for
truth.
To deny that risky assumption
is, however, to affirm an even
riskier one: that people must be
protected from certain kinds of
error, and have their truth
presented to them in contrived
and manipulated form. When
Hubert Humphrey spoke on this

campus three years ago, he
convicted himself out of his own
mouth, so that students who
heard him could hear for
themselves at first hand how
bankrupt and wrong was the
Johnson policy in Vietnam.
Without intending to do so, Mr.
Humphrey struck a great blow for
war protest. To be sure, there are
no automatic victories for truth,
but there will be no victories at all
if truth is to be purchased only by
the route of suppressing error.
5 . On the level of tactics, those
who decide to disrupt a speech
need to be clear what they are,
and are not, doing. If the purpose
of Monday's disruption was to
downgrade Mr. Lodge in the eyes
of the nation, it certainly failed.
He emerged across the land
smelling like a rose.
If, on the other hand, the
purpose was to downgrade the
university, there was surely some

success. We emerged smelling like
something else. Those who
disrupted in the name of the first
alternative need to be aware that
in fact they achieved only the
second alternative. The message
the nation got was not that Lodge
was a war criminal, but that a
university appeared afraid to hear
a certain point of view. Here is a
point at which a consideration of
ends and means involves not only
moral but also pragmatic
considerations.
6. Does the university have a
special role in relation to free
speech? I believe it does. 1 believe
that in a society that increasingly
resorts to the repression of
unpopular viewpoints, it is even
more the role of the university to
refuse to do so. We are those, in
an increasingly irrational society,
who need to cling to - and
embody - the audacious and
foolhardly and seemingly

outdated notion that men's
differing convictions can be
ventilated and not merely
violated, and who dare to believe
that something as frail and
precious as a mere idea can be a
powerful force for good.
If we fail to demonstrate, on
the campus, that such a vision can
prevail, then we can be very sure
that it will not long prevail
elsewhere, and that issues will
increasingly be decided not simply
by who shouts down who most
vociferously, but by who can most
effectively keep a viewpoint
opposing his own from being
heard. That is not a definition of a
university or a democratic society,
but it describes what will happen
to us if we try to limit those to
whom our community can be
exposed.
