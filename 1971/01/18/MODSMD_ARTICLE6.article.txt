Editor, THE DAILY:
A further example of the kind
of discrimination directed toward
women students by the Cowell
Health Center concerns the
obvious follow-up to hasseling
over contraception: namely,
pregnancy. While Cowell Health is
quite willing to give a woman a
pregnancy test, if the test is
positive and the woman is
intending to have the child (as in
the case of many women graduate
students) Cowell Health refuses to
have anything to do with the
pre-natal care of the woman.
She can go to the Stanford
Clinic or to a private physician.
And when it comes time for the
child to be born, the woman is
not covered by any health
insurance offered by
school—pregnancy and childbirth
is a specific exclusion. The bill for
private services will be well over
$5 00. It is difficult enough to
finance tuition, with its presumed
attendant medical services,
without having to be personally
responsible for the high cost of
hospitalization which could be
provided by the Health Center.

Ask any woman student with
children whether she feels the
university is supportive of her
education—she can only reply that
the university, like every
institution in the society forces a
woman to choose between career
and parenthood, rather than help
make the two compatible.

miscast
Editor,THE DAILY:
It is unfortunately typical of
Stanford students to miscast
alternatives remaining to them
when their preferred option is
thwarted in some manner
(whether it be in seeking a job, or
political activity, or just in the
more general use of their time.)
Although it would be inferring
too much from omissions in Chris
Peck's concluding remark in his
article "Summer Jobs to be Rare
in '71"—"for many Stanford
students, a summer of suntan and
television seem to be
inevitable"—these are obviously
not the only alternatives to fill an

unemployed summer. Just those
that come most comfortably to
mind. Service and political groups
in many communities need the
help of those with time on their
hands.
Bill Behn
little ego
Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a very sincere letter
from one of us "frustrated little
egos bumping heads" with
another ego called Capitalist
Amerika. Unlike nature, I am
hung up on something, but it's
only the survival of my
tube-shaped-pattern—and maybe
the tube-shaped patterns of my
brothers and sisters—and the
survival of other assorted
organisms and vapors.
I was really digging your article
Friday until you labled "Power to
the People" an abstract cause or
ego-trip, and perhaps you only do
so because you are unable to
relate "Power to the People" and
other "radical rhetoric" to the
survival of people as valid
organisms within nature, worthy
of preservation.

Listen to Agnew say . .the
nation's welfare dilemma can only
be solved completely when
someone is willing to make tough
decisions such as. . .whether a
man on public health insurance...
should be kept alive an extra
month at the cost of $20,000 to
$30,000 to the taxpayers." Listen
to Reagan insist that balancing the
state's budget is more crucial than
food and shelter for a welfare
mother. Watch Downtown Palo
Alto, Inc., drive people out of
their homes and small businesses
in the name of progress.
Wars are bloody, horrible hate
trips and Ph.D. degrees and
Chryslers are useless status trips,
to be sure. But I urge you not to
label all struggles—even struggles
to maintain decent housing and
- clean air, et cetera—as abstract
ego-trips. When a chile is hungry,
shouldn't all of nature hurt for
him?
