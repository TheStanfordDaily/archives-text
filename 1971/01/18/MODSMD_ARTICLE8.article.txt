# Cable TV Investigated
## 
### 
Development of a "living
I ibrary"â€”through which
Stanford's resources can be
offered via cable television to the
campus and surrounding
communities is being actively
explored by the University.
The suggestion stems from a
special University committee set
up in late August to study the
possibilities of the new medium
and has received the endorsement
of University President Richard
W. Lyman.
The student-faculty-staff
committee, headed by Professor
Edwin B. Parker of the
Department of Communi
cation .recommended the
establishment of a 24 channel
cable TV network, which
hopefully will tie in with a
municipal network now under
study by the city of Palo Alto.

The committee report
suggested that the "living library"
could include low-cost
video-taping of seminars,
extended language laboratory
services, access by telephone dial
to an information system for
instructional materials, or access
by the same means to educational
video cassettes " when they
become generally available," as
well as computer-assisted
instruction (CAI).
A wide range of instructional
techniques for on-eampus or
off-campus use could be
developed and transmitted, the
report suggested, with emphasis
on individualized instruction.
Or, the report said, "interested
faculty could develop plans for an
experimental 'education delivery
system' that could be extended to
Stanford area communities.

The report, which contained 26
recommendations, also dealt with
the technical aspects of access to
the cable system and the
possibilities of producing revenue
from it.
President Lyman, in earlier
correspondence with the
committee, suggested that the
University could originate
instructional public affairs,
information and "continuing
education" programs for the
campus and environs, and that a
number of University departments
might be interested in the research
potential of the network.
Stanford last year inaugurated a
closed-circuit television system
between the School of
Engineering and a number of Bay
Area electronic manufacturing
plants as a means of continuing
engineering education.
