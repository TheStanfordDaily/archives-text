# Residence Innovations
## Housing Idea Deadline Soon 
### 
A few years ago the only type
of housing available to
undergraduates was single-sex
housing. Options were increased
when coeducational residences
opened. The university now has
begun to actively seek housing
innovations by appealing to the
students for proposals.
"Some of the most successful
housing on campus is a result of
student innovation," according to

Larry Horton of the Dean of
Students Office. It is the goal of
the housing system to respond to
the needs of the community by
providing channels for
implementation of residential
programs. Proposals for
student-innovated housing for
1 971 -72 are now being accepted.
Columbae and Jordan Houses are
the results of last year's planning
by undergraduates.

Student-innovated housing does
not entail an expansion of the
housing system. Existing
university facilities will
accommodate the proposed
residences. Students submitting
proposals should specify what
type of facilities they seek.
The Dean of Students Office
requests that the following
information be included with a
description of the proposal. There
must be a justification for the use
of scarce university housing.
According to Mr. Horton, the
university is seeking programs
with an emphasis on learning
within the residence, although it is
not necessary that there be an
academic theme. The proposal
should also detail staffing
arrangements. Staffing
arrangements include those
faculty members residing in the
house or participating as
organizers or sponsors. The
method of student assignment to
the house should be mentioned.
Students interested in
proposing residential programs for
the academic year 1 971 -72 should
contact Larry Horton in Old
Union or by calling university
extension 3046. Proposals should
be submitted by February 15 .
