# Oil Slick From Collision Spreads, Worst Spill In Bay Area History
## 
### 
The worst oii slick in San Francisco
Bay history oozeri around Alcatraz
Island today and is inching under the
Bay bridge as clean-up crews work to
contain the slick to a five-mile radius.
The collision of two Standard Oil
tankers, the Arizona Standard and the
Oregon Standard, in dense fog on
Monday morning was the cause of the 2
million gallon spill. The San Francisco
mishap is larger than the celebrated
Santa Barbara slick of two years ago.
Standard Oil launched a massive
clean-up operation yesterday, hoping to
contain the slick before it reached the
bay's shoreline. In some areas the oil
was less than a mile from land.
J.C. Keating, General Manager of the
Standard Oil refinery in Richmond said
the slick "could be cleaned up in two
or three days if the weather holds."
Keating said that floating booms,
sweepercraft, and hay were all being
U9ed to mop up the goo.
Leakage Continuing
The leakage from the damaged
Oregon Standard was not completely
stopped today, but the main spillage of
the fuel has passed, according to a
refinery spokesman.
The Coast Guard would not
speculate about possible ecological
damage to the Bay as a result of the
spill. Some officials gave the impression
of a guarded optimism while others
expressed concern about possible
damage to shorelife and birds near the
slick.
The Coast Guard would also make
no comment as to possible causes of
the crash except for a one-word
communique, "fog." The Guard said it
had both the ships on its radar screen

prior to the collision and that it had
radioed a warning to the Arizona
Standard about the presence of another
ship in the immediate vicinity.
At 1:45 a.m., the two ships collided
directly under the Golden Gate Bridge.
The Arizona Standard pierced the hull
of its sister ship, destroying two of the
Oregon's 5 00,000 gallon oil tanks. The
bunker oil being carried in the Oregon
Standard was to be used as fuel by
ships.
No Injuries
There were no injuries aboard either
craft, and the Arizona was able to make
port under its own power. The Oregon
sustained more serious damage and was
still anchored in the bay yesterday.
The clean-up operations have so far
kept the oil away from the pleasure
boats in the Sausalito area and in the

south bay. Three marinas were in
danger from the slick, but clean-up
spokesmen say that booms should be
able to keep the worst of the slick away
from the private boats.
Second Accident
The oil spill in the Bay is the second
such accident in two weeks. On
January 8 th, the previous record for
largest oil spill in the Bay was recorded
when a Norwegian carrier accidentally
pumped 12,000 gallons of fuel into the
East Bay.
Standard Oil's Fleet Manager, W.F.
Sch ill, promised his company's
unqualified help in cleaning up the
mess should the oil reach the San
Francisco shore. "If any oil should
reach the beach areas," Schill promised,
"we will utilize suction trucks and
straw to clean it up."

STANFORD'S WHlTEOUT—Yesterday morning's thick mist, which took until
mid-morning to dissolve, hid a lot of familiar landmarks even Hoover Tower, from
view. However, to some perenially bleary-eyed students, who perhaps had
forgotten to drink their morning coffee, visibility was neither better nor worse
than normal.

refinery spokesman.
The Coast Guard would not
speculate about possible ecological
damage to the Bay as a result of the
spill. Some officials gave the impression
of a guarded optimism while others
expressed concern about possible
damage to shorelife and birds near the
slick.
The Coast Guard would also make
no comment as to possible causes of
the crash except for a one-word
communique, "fog." The Guard said it
had both the ships on its radar screen

prior to the collision and that it had
radioed a warning to the Arizona
Standard about the presence of another
ship in the immediate vicinity.
At 1:45 a.m., the two ships collided
directly under the Golden Gate Bridge.
The Arizona Standard pierced the hull
of its sister ship, destroying two of the
Oregon's 5 00,000 gallon oil tanks. The
bunker oil being carried in the Oregon
Standard was to be used as fuel by
ships.
No Injuries
There were no injuries aboard either
craft, and the Arizona was able to make
port under its own power. The Oregon
sustained more serious damage and was
still anchored in the bay yesterday.
The clean-up operations have so far
kept the oil away from the pleasure
boats in the Sausalito area and in the

south bay. Three marinas were in
danger from the slick, but clean-up
spokesmen say that booms should be
able to keep the worst of the slick away
from the private boats.
Second Accident
The oil spill in the Bay is the second
such accident in two weeks. On
January 8 th, the previous record for
largest oil spill in the Bay was recorded
when a Norwegian carrier accidentally
pumped 12,000 gallons of fuel into the
East Bay.
Standard Oil's Fleet Manager, W.F.
Sch ill, promised his company's
unqualified help in cleaning up the
mess should the oil reach the San
Francisco shore. "If any oil should
reach the beach areas," Schill promised,
"we will utilize suction trucks and
straw to clean it up."

STANFORD'S WHlTEOUT—Yesterday morning's thick mist, which took until
mid-morning to dissolve, hid a lot of familiar landmarks even Hoover Tower, from
view. However, to some perenially bleary-eyed students, who perhaps had
forgotten to drink their morning coffee, visibility was neither better nor worse
than normal.
The worst oii slick in San Francisco
Bay history oozeri around Alcatraz
Island today and is inching under the
Bay bridge as clean-up crews work to
contain the slick to a five-mile radius.
The collision of two Standard Oil
tankers, the Arizona Standard and the
Oregon Standard, in dense fog on
Monday morning was the cause of the 2
million gallon spill. The San Francisco
mishap is larger than the celebrated
Santa Barbara slick of two years ago.
Standard Oil launched a massive
clean-up operation yesterday, hoping to
contain the slick before it reached the
bay's shoreline. In some areas the oil
was less than a mile from land.
J.C. Keating, General Manager of the
Standard Oil refinery in Richmond said
the slick "could be cleaned up in two
or three days if the weather holds."
Keating said that floating booms,
sweepercraft, and hay were all being
U9ed to mop up the goo.
Leakage Continuing
The leakage from the damaged
Oregon Standard was not completely
stopped today, but the main spillage of
the fuel has passed, according to a
refinery spokesman.
