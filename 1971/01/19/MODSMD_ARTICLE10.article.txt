# Neglected Sibelius Hits The Big Time

No. 1 in a series of MUSICAL
PERSONALITIES .
About thirty or perhaps forty
years ago there was a movement
in England and in the United
States to crown Sibelius a second
Beethoven, and to this day his
music remains conspicuous on
British concert programs. But over
the years he has fallen into abuse
in this country, and the current
American record catalogue can
scarcely be said to do justice to
his music. It is generally
acknowledged today that Sibelius
stands pretty much in a class by
himself.
Sibelius was born in 18 65
(making him a contemporary of
Rimsky-Korsakov and Debussy),
of mixed Finnish and Swedish
parentage. His early life was
absorbed almost totally in musical
matters. There is a story told of
him that he and a friend went
walking in the woods one evening
when, upon coming to a shore,
they encountered some flax and
hemp drying which was giving off
an offensive smell. Sibelius
stopped still, remained motionless
as if hypnotized, and then
suddenly made for home. Once
home, he sat down at the piano
and began to compose. He had
completely translated the
experience of the hemp into a
musical language.
It was originally intended that
he study law; however, when his
legal studies interferred with
music, he abandoned the former.
In 1 8 9 2 he premiered his

"Kullervo" Symphony for
soloists, chorus and orchestra (not
one of the seven symphonies) and
became instantly a national hero.
A few years later he was
granted a government pension,
and thus, freed of economic
pressure, Sibelius remained
remarkably prolific for the next
fifteen or so years. But although
Sibelius lived to be ninety-eight,
he wrote comparatively little after
he was fifty, and, with the
publication of "Tapiola" in 1 925 ,
his catalogue of works was all but
closed.
Perhaps Sibelius' most unique
facility in music was the
continuity with which he was able
to imbue his symphonies. No one
yet, for instance, has been able to
pinpoint where exactly the third
movement of his second
symphony ends and the fourth
movement begins. For the finale
grows out of the third movement
with unprecedented continuity.
And Sibelius was, in fact, the first
composer to produce a
completely successful symphony
in one movement (No. 7).
In his later years, Sibelius
became a living legend. Finns
would invoke his name for a
solemn oath, and anecdotes were
widely circulated. One such tells
of a drinking party which Sibelius
attended. His friend Kajanus left
in order to conduct a symphony
concert of some of Sibelius'
works, and when he returned,
Sibelius greeted him with:
"Kajanus, you certainly spent a
long time in the bathroom."


SIBELIUSâ€”The musical Finn is a national hero in his homeland, but
his genius is slighted here.
