U Thant To Quit
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - U Thant, who has served
as U.N. secretary general longer than any other man,
announced yesterday that he intends to step down
when his current term expires at the end of this year.
Thant told a news conference four days before his
62 nd birthday, that "I have no intention whatever of
serving beyond the present term."
Thant, a Burmese diplomat who started as a
schoolmaster, is the third secretary general. Trygve
Lie of Norway served from 1 94 6 to 1953. Dag
Hammarskiold of Sweden was in office from 195 3 to
1961.
Thant was chosen Nov. 3, 1961, after
Hammarskjold's death in a plane crash. He is now
serving his second five-year term.
Thant said toward the end of his first term that he
did not want to go for a second. But the big powers
facing the problem of agreeing on a successor,
persuaded him to stay on.
Some diplomats believe that they will manage to
do so again, especially since Thant is considered a
prospect for president of the U.N. university he has
proposed. He may want to stay around till it is
established a few years hence, they say.
Names of possible successors to Thant include U.N.
Ambassadors Max Jakobson of Finland, Edward
Hambro of Norway, Kurt Waldheim of Austria,
Mexican ex-Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo Flores
and the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Iranian
Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan.
At the 45-minute news conference Thant
remarked: "I don't think it will be difficult for the
members to agree on a suitable successor."
In a prepared opening statement, Thant hailed the
General Assembly's 51-49 vote last Nov. 20 for

seating Communist China the first majority in 20
years for such a change, although it was nullified by
a two-thirds rule. He said "the majority of member
states has thus indicated its support for the early
realization" of the "important principle" of
unversality in U.N. membership.
Seniority System Attacked
WASHINGTON — In a fresh attack on the seniority
system, two senators joined yesterday in an effort to
subject each Senate committee chairman to a
recorded vote every two years.
Sens. Fred Harris, D-Okla., and Charles McC.
Mathias, Jr., R-Md., said they intend to force the
Issue by offering an amendment to the Senate's rules
when the new Congress convenes Thursday.
They talked with newsmen after conducting an
informal hearing at which the traditional system of
awarding committee chairmanships to the member
with the longest service was assailed by John W.
Gardner, chairman of the citizens lobby Common
Cause; Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of
the National Urban League, and others.
Ecuador Ban
WASHINGTON — The United States slapped a 12
month ban on aircraft sales and ship repair credits for
Ecuador yesterday in retaliation for that country's
seizure of American fishing vessels on what the
United States considers to be the high seas.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers summoned
Ecuadorian Ambassador Carlos Mantilla to his office
Monday to inform him of the crackdown.

At noon Monday, press officer Robert J.
McCloskey told a news conference four ships had
been seized by Ecuador this month. Later he said
fishing industry sources reported the seizure of live
more with two others being pursued, evidently by
Ecuadorian government.
Rogers also threatened action against $25.5 million
of economic assistance for the South American
country, warning the ambassador that it is under
review.
In addition, a State Department spokesman said,
Rogers declared "other possible measures are being
reviewed urgently and further action by this
government" cannot be ruled out.
Ecuador claims that for purposes of fishing control
its territorial waters extend 200 miles from shore.
"Our purpose in taking the action we have taken,"
McCloskey told newsmen, "is not so much
retribution or revenge as it is to protect what we
consider to be the rights of a American fisherman in
these waters on the high seas."
Drugs Are Powerless
WASHINGTON — More than 14 percent of some
1 6,000 drugs tested for the Food and Drug
Administration were found to be ineffective, the
FDA commissioner said yesterday.
Dr. Charles C. Edwards told the Senate monopoly
subcommittee that a test of 1 6,57 3 drugs conducted
by the National Academy of Science produced these
findings:
Ineffective 14.7 percent; possibly effective 34.9
percent; probably effective 7.3 percent; effective
1 9.1 percent; and effective but with some
qualification 2 4 percent.

WASHINGTON — More than 14 percent of some
1 6,000 drugs tested for the Food and Drug
Administration were found to be ineffective, the
FDA commissioner said yesterday.
Dr. Charles C. Edwards told the Senate monopoly
subcommittee that a test of 1 6,57 3 drugs conducted
by the National Academy of Science produced these
findings:
Ineffective 14.7 percent; possibly effective 34.9
percent; probably effective 7.3 percent; effective
1 9.1 percent; and effective but with some
qualification 2 4 percent.
U Thant To Quit
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y. - U Thant, who has served
as U.N. secretary general longer than any other man,
announced yesterday that he intends to step down
when his current term expires at the end of this year.
Thant told a news conference four days before his
62 nd birthday, that "I have no intention whatever of
serving beyond the present term."
Thant, a Burmese diplomat who started as a
schoolmaster, is the third secretary general. Trygve
Lie of Norway served from 1 94 6 to 1953. Dag
Hammarskiold of Sweden was in office from 195 3 to
1961.
Thant was chosen Nov. 3, 1961, after
Hammarskjold's death in a plane crash. He is now
serving his second five-year term.
Thant said toward the end of his first term that he
did not want to go for a second. But the big powers
facing the problem of agreeing on a successor,
persuaded him to stay on.
Some diplomats believe that they will manage to
do so again, especially since Thant is considered a
prospect for president of the U.N. university he has
proposed. He may want to stay around till it is
established a few years hence, they say.
Names of possible successors to Thant include U.N.
Ambassadors Max Jakobson of Finland, Edward
Hambro of Norway, Kurt Waldheim of Austria,
Mexican ex-Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo Flores
and the U.N. high commissioner for refugees, Iranian
Prince Sadruddin Agha Khan.
At the 45-minute news conference Thant
remarked: "I don't think it will be difficult for the
members to agree on a suitable successor."
In a prepared opening statement, Thant hailed the
General Assembly's 51-49 vote last Nov. 20 for

seating Communist China the first majority in 20
years for such a change, although it was nullified by
a two-thirds rule. He said "the majority of member
states has thus indicated its support for the early
realization" of the "important principle" of
unversality in U.N. membership.
Seniority System Attacked
WASHINGTON — In a fresh attack on the seniority
system, two senators joined yesterday in an effort to
subject each Senate committee chairman to a
recorded vote every two years.
Sens. Fred Harris, D-Okla., and Charles McC.
Mathias, Jr., R-Md., said they intend to force the
Issue by offering an amendment to the Senate's rules
when the new Congress convenes Thursday.
They talked with newsmen after conducting an
informal hearing at which the traditional system of
awarding committee chairmanships to the member
with the longest service was assailed by John W.
Gardner, chairman of the citizens lobby Common
Cause; Whitney M. Young Jr., executive director of
the National Urban League, and others.
Ecuador Ban
WASHINGTON — The United States slapped a 12
month ban on aircraft sales and ship repair credits for
Ecuador yesterday in retaliation for that country's
seizure of American fishing vessels on what the
United States considers to be the high seas.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers summoned
Ecuadorian Ambassador Carlos Mantilla to his office
Monday to inform him of the crackdown.

At noon Monday, press officer Robert J.
McCloskey told a news conference four ships had
been seized by Ecuador this month. Later he said
fishing industry sources reported the seizure of live
more with two others being pursued, evidently by
Ecuadorian government.
Rogers also threatened action against $25.5 million
of economic assistance for the South American
country, warning the ambassador that it is under
review.
In addition, a State Department spokesman said,
Rogers declared "other possible measures are being
reviewed urgently and further action by this
government" cannot be ruled out.
Ecuador claims that for purposes of fishing control
its territorial waters extend 200 miles from shore.
"Our purpose in taking the action we have taken,"
McCloskey told newsmen, "is not so much
retribution or revenge as it is to protect what we
consider to be the rights of a American fisherman in
these waters on the high seas."

Ecuador claims that for purposes of fishing control
its territorial waters extend 200 miles from shore.

these waters on the high seas."
Drugs Are Powerless
WASHINGTON — More than 14 percent of some
1 6,000 drugs tested for the Food and Drug
Administration were found to be ineffective, the
FDA commissioner said yesterday.
Dr. Charles C. Edwards told the Senate monopoly
subcommittee that a test of 1 6,57 3 drugs conducted
by the National Academy of Science produced these
findings:
Ineffective 14.7 percent; possibly effective 34.9
percent; probably effective 7.3 percent; effective
1 9.1 percent; and effective but with some
qualification 2 4 percent.
