# Panel Discusses Engineers’ Responsibility
## 
### JIM DEERINGER 
What is wrong with engineering at
Stanford?
Why are engineers so often defensive
when criticized about their work?
These were among the topics
discussed yesterday in Skilling
Auditorium at a seminar called "Is
there room for society in the engineer?
(and vice versa)."
A five-man panel, all but one
engineers, aired their frustrations and
discussed their proposals for a more
socially responsible technical
community here. >
"If the technical community doesn't
regulate itself, even if it means biting
the hand that feeds it, then the outside
community will come in and squash
it," said Stan Glantz, a graduate
student in applied mechanics.
"The technical community has
tremendous potential for leadership in
this country," he stated, but it is
"brought off right now" by the

corporations which fund research and
supply jobs.
Blow The Whistle
Len Schwartz, another engineer on
the panel, felt that corporations will
always be able to find enough engineers
who are not personally responsible,
who do not ask questions. He is quite
pessimistic about the future and sees a
reordering of government priorities as
the only way out of the dilemma.
Glantz says, on the other hand, that
the technician must initiate the reforms

needed. Although it is highly dangerous
for the person involved, "if a technician
blows the whistle on the
(military-industrial) machine, the effect
will be twice as great."
Dave Schulman, another panelist,
noted that even when consulted by the
executive or legislative departments of
the government, technicians merely
"lay the report on the table and walk
away. They fail to speak out."
"Engineers have a responsibility to
decide how their talents are to be
used," stated an engineer in the
audience, "but they allow themselves
to become tools" of decision-makers.
'Too Busy'
"A lot of engineers are eigher 'too
busy' or simply too escapist to concern
themselves with political or social
issues," said Professor Holt Ashley of
Astro-aeronautics, moderator of the
panel.
"It is possible to use the device of
rationality to thwart a good effort

toward communication" with the
outside community, he observed.
"The elitism of engineers has grown
up over the last 600 years," noted yet
another engineer. "There is a tendency
for an engineer to feel that he is more
rational because he is dealing with fact
rather than with social order."

MARLENE—On view tonight in Mem Clive (better known to some as Geology
320) is "The Devil Is A Woman," reputed to be Josef von Starnberg's greatest film
of all time. It's one of Todd McCarthy's favorites, in any case. The picture, which
stars Marlene Dietrich, was the last of the von Sternberg-Dietrich sagas, and, for
both participants, remained the favorite of their seven screen collaborations. "The
Devil Is A Woman" will be shown at 8 p.m. and will be followed at 10 by "Belle
Of The Nineties," Mae West's last uncensored episode.

"lay the report on the table and walk
away. They fail to speak out."
"Engineers have a responsibility to
decide how their talents are to be
used," stated an engineer in the
audience, "but they allow themselves
to become tools" of decision-makers.
'Too Busy'
"A lot of engineers are eigher 'too
busy' or simply too escapist to concern
themselves with political or social
issues," said Professor Holt Ashley of
Astro-aeronautics, moderator of the
panel.
"It is possible to use the device of
rationality to thwart a good effort

toward communication" with the
outside community, he observed.
"The elitism of engineers has grown
up over the last 600 years," noted yet
another engineer. "There is a tendency
for an engineer to feel that he is more
rational because he is dealing with fact
rather than with social order."

MARLENE—On view tonight in Mem Clive (better known to some as Geology
320) is "The Devil Is A Woman," reputed to be Josef von Starnberg's greatest film
of all time. It's one of Todd McCarthy's favorites, in any case. The picture, which
stars Marlene Dietrich, was the last of the von Sternberg-Dietrich sagas, and, for
both participants, remained the favorite of their seven screen collaborations. "The
Devil Is A Woman" will be shown at 8 p.m. and will be followed at 10 by "Belle
Of The Nineties," Mae West's last uncensored episode.

What is wrong with engineering at
Stanford?
Why are engineers so often defensive
when criticized about their work?
These were among the topics
discussed yesterday in Skilling
Auditorium at a seminar called "Is
there room for society in the engineer?
(and vice versa)."
A five-man panel, all but one
engineers, aired their frustrations and
discussed their proposals for a more
socially responsible technical
community here. >
"If the technical community doesn't
regulate itself, even if it means biting
the hand that feeds it, then the outside
community will come in and squash
it," said Stan Glantz, a graduate
student in applied mechanics.
"The technical community has
tremendous potential for leadership in
this country," he stated, but it is
"brought off right now" by the

corporations which fund research and
supply jobs.
Blow The Whistle
Len Schwartz, another engineer on
the panel, felt that corporations will
always be able to find enough engineers
who are not personally responsible,
who do not ask questions. He is quite
pessimistic about the future and sees a
reordering of government priorities as
the only way out of the dilemma.
Glantz says, on the other hand, that
the technician must initiate the reforms

needed. Although it is highly dangerous
for the person involved, "if a technician
blows the whistle on the
(military-industrial) machine, the effect
will be twice as great."
Dave Schulman, another panelist,
noted that even when consulted by the
executive or legislative departments of
the government, technicians merely
"lay the report on the table and walk
away. They fail to speak out."

decide how their talents are to be
