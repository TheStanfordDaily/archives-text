# U.S. Escalates Aerial Involvement In Battle For Cambodian Highway
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The United States has increased its
direct involvement in the Cambodian
War, according tc authoritative sources
and field dispatches.
Navy support ships, Army
helicopters and liaison personnel have
lent support to Allied ground troops
during the current campaign to reopen
Highway 4, the only link between the
Cambodian capital of Phom Penh and
the seaport of Kompong Sem.
The moves, which included the
stationing of 2 U.S. 7 th Fleet
helicopter carriers off Cambodia, were
made without official announcement.
Many sources, including the
Associated Press, view these
developments as an escalation of the
American role in the Cambodian
fighting. "The United States apparently
has pulled all the steps on the use of
American air power in Cambodia by
flying South Vietnamese troops and
supplies into battle and protecting
them with helicopter gunships," stated
one A.P. story.
Although insisting there has been no
change in policy, a top Pentagon

spokesman yesterday broadened
considerably the grounds for using
American aircraft in Cambodia.
Jerry W. Friedheim, the spokesman,
was asked specifically whether U.S.
aircraft have free rein to operate
anywhere in Cambodia as long as no
U.S. ground forces or advisers are
involved and their action could be
interpreted as a benefit to American
troops in South Vietnam.
"I thought that was what I had been
saying in different words," Friedheim
replied.
At the White House, press secretary
Ronald Ziegler said U.S. policy
continues to be that "there will be no
U.S. ground forces nor will there be
U.S. advisory personnel involved in
Cambodia."
However, a photograph taken
Saturday near Ta New, south of the
Stung Chhay pass along Highway 4,
showed an American in a camouflaged
jungle suit on the ground running to
board a U.S. helicopter that had
landed.
Col. Robert W. Leonard, chief of the
U.S. command's information office,
stated, "I have no comment on the
picture. As has been stated, there are
no U.S. advisers on the ground in
Cambodia."
Liaison Officer
Other sources, however, described
the American as a liaison officer,
presumably coordinating the U.S.
logistics support to the South
Vietnamese and Cambodians.
Three successive days of "protective
reaction" air attacks inside North
Vietnam completed the picture of an

apparent increase of U.S. Air Force
participation in the Indochina War.
Two Thunderchief fighter-bombers
fired Shrike missiles at two North
Vietnamese anti-aircraft batteries
Sunday in the most recent of the raids.
The attacks were the fifth and sixth
such "protective reactions" in nine
days.
The F-105 involved in the first
incident is believed to have been
escorting U.S. B-52 bombers striking
the Ho Chi Mihn trail in Laos.
Imminent Threat

said they did not see any SAM

missilthat enemy radar had locked onto
the planes, in preparation for firing,
thus posing an imminent threat.
Stanford faculty members last night
expressed mixed opinions about the
increased U.S. air support.
Lyman Van Slyke, Associate
Professor of History, stated the recent
developments struck him as being "bad
news." Van Slyke viewed the increased
air support as counter - productive with
respect to American withdrawal efforts
in Southeast Asia.
"We're going out on the ground and
coming in the air," he commented.
Exactly the opposite view was voiced
by Professor Robert Horn of Political
Science. "President Nixon is winding

up the war, and the present actions are
part of that process," he said.
Minor Aspect
Horn sees nothing ominous about
the use of American liaison personnel
in Cambodia. "We had a great deal of
hysteria last spring over very minor
aspect of the (Indochina) situation," he
stated. "I certainly hope we are not
going to have that hysteria over a very
minor aspect of withdrawal from
Southeast Asia."
Earl Martin, a graduate student in
East Asian studies gave his view of U.S.
Indochina strategy, citing as a source
of information William Solomon, a
former ambassador to Laos who new
works for the state department in
Saigon.
"It's clear that the Pentagon is
thinking in terms of Cambodia," Martin
explained. "They'll just keep bombing
as long as necessary. They can drop the
troop level down to 5 0,0 0 0 and 75,0 0 0
and keep bombing and hang onto
Cambodia with Lon Nol.
Possible support for this theory may
be found in an announcement made
Sunday by American military sources
that the United States has frozen
withdrawal of Air Force squadrons in
Southeast Asia. The action was taken
to assure a high level of allied firepower
during the pullout of U.S. ground
troops.
Martin feels the war is swinging away
from Vietnam to Cambodia. The aim of
the U.S. war policy is to stop the North
Vietnamese, who are using Cambodia as
a staging area prior to offensive in
South Vietnam.
"The Scenario I see is increased
bombing along the Ho Chi Minh trail,"
he added. Since the trail is a vaguely
defined area, the fighting will spill over
into Laos as well. "I suppose the South
Vietnamese army is in and out of Laos
quite a bit," Martin concluded.
After the recent, offensive allied
forces claimed control of all but a
32-mile stretch of Highway 4 .
Troops of the North Vietnamese Lst
Division have held portions of the road

since Nov. 21, cutting Phnom Penh off
from its only deepwater seaport 115
miles to the southwest.
South Vietnamese military sources
admitted U.S. Army Cobra helicopter
gunships have been flying into
Cambodia in support of South
Vietnamese troops.
But the U.S. Command said
American aircraft fly into Cambodia
only for "interdiction" missions, raids
against ground objectives such as roads.
