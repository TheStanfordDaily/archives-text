# In Wake Of Lodge Disruption
## Franklin Hit With Conduct Charge 
### JONATHAN DEDMON CHRIS KATZENBACH 
President Richard Lyman yesterday
informed English professor H. Bruce
Franklin that disciplinary action will be
brought against him for alleged
participation in the disturbances which
forced cancellation of Ambassador
Henry Cabor Lodge's speech here Jan.
11.
President Lyman designated the
Advisory Board of the Academic
Council to hear the case should Prof.
Franklin wish a hearing.
In recommending that the Advisory
Council to hear the case - should
Franklin desire one - Lyman said that
Franklin warrants penalties under
Paragraph 15 of the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure.
This states that disciplinary action
may be brought against a faculty
member for "personal conduct
substantially impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate
functions within the University
Community."
Confidential Letter
In a two-page confidential letter
which Prof. Franklin made public last

night, Lyman wrote, "I am informed
that on Monday, January 11,19 71 you
deliberately contributed to the
disturbance which forced the
cancellation of a speech scheduled to
be given by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge at Dinkelspiel Auditorium. If
this is true you should be subject to
disciplinary action."
Based on this change disciplinary
action, which could range from a salary
cut to dismissal can only be imposed after
an opportunity for a hearing beofre the
Advisory Board.
Cases within the jurisdiction of the
Advisory Council cannot be heard by
the Interim Panel for Faculty Hearing
Groups the Academic Council's other
judicial body, or by any of the Interim
Group's subcommittees.
Students Charged
Ten students have been charged
before the Student Judicial Committee
for being in violation of the
University's campus disruption policy
at the Lodge disturbance.
Franklin's conduct as professor has
been called into question, not a specific
violation of the campus disruption
policy. It is this difference in the charge

which explains his appearance before a
different judicial body.
Franklin has until January 22 to
request a hearing before the Advisory
Board.
As Lyman's letter concludes, "If I do
not hear from you by Jan. 22. 1971 , I
will conclude that you do not wish to
contest the charges or to attempt to

reach an agreement. I will thereupon
reach a decision as to the penalty to be
imposed."
Franklin had no comment last night.
Members of the Advisory Board are
Profs. David M. Mason, chemical
engineering, chairman; David Levin,
English; Lee J. Cronbach, education;
G.L. Gach, business and economics;
William R. Rambo, electrical
engineering; David A. Hamburg
psychiatry; and Donald Kennedy,
biological sciences.
