# Government Data Banks â€“ Invasions Of Privacy?
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN BILL EVERS 
Last of a two-part series
"Potentially the most serious threat to
individual privacy in America is government.
Chances are the government knows a good deal
about you - more than you realize ... In fact,
it's very unlikely you're not on some
government list..."
Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher's (D-N.J.)
grim assessment of the pervasive nature of
government surveillance is documented by the
stunning fact that government files contain
sensitive information on one-fourth of this
nation's population.
Infiltration of various political organizations
is one method of gathering such information,
but government agencies which lack the
manpower for direct spying rely heavily upon
the computer to bolster their files.
The remarkable technological advances in
handling tremendous volumes of data has
resulted in governmental ownership or rental of
5277 computers. In 1959, there were only 403.
Information Gathering
In order to gather information on its citizens,
the government employs a Secret Service
computer which stores the names of dossiers of

activist, "malcontents," persistent seekers of
redress, and those who would "embarass" the
President or other government leaders.
Another data bank, compiled by the Justice
Department, issues weekly printouts of national
tension points on racial, class, and political
issues, as well as the individuals and groups
which are involved with them. Peace rallies,
welfare demonstrations, and other expressions
of dissent comprise a "data base" against which
tbe computer can measure the mood of the
nation and the militancy of its citizens. Subjects
are listed as "radical" or "moderate."
The Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA) of the .Justice
Department has doled-out millions of dollars to
new local and state computer installations which
are housed in police agencies across the country.
Under a law passed this year, the .Justice
Department is preparing to computerize and
distribute nationally to the police and
prosecutors and courts the names of all persons
charged anywhere with drug offenses. A dnig
user's past record, no matter how slight, will
become instantly available wherever he goes - by
teletyped reports from the computer.
Desire For Cross-feeding
Since a number of government agencies, not
all of which participate in direct domestic
surveillance, keep certain r"cords on private

citizens, there is a great inter-governmental
desire to cross-feed the collected data.
For example, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, whose own files include
the names of 200,000 private businessmen and
contractors with questionable reputations, is
considering integrating its collection with the
Justice Department's computerized organized
crime file.
Technological effeciency? Yes. But there is
also the very real danger that the judgment of
one file - perhaps a mistaken judgement - will

Newt Analysis

become the factual assessment of a
computerized monolith. The result: a
government wide black mark, an indelible
decision unknown to its subject and made and
distributed without opportunity for redress. In
short, everyone but the accused would have
access to a single file that could incriminate him
for the rest of his life.
Data-Bank Network
Senator Sam J. Krvin (D-N.C.) denounced the
emergence of what appears to be a widespread
data bank network. "I believe that in these
systems, where they contain the record of the
individual thoughts, beliefs, habits, altitude's,

and personal activities, there may well rest a
potential for political control and for
intimidation which is alien to a society of free
men."
The police-state implications of the severe
degree of domestic surveillance to which this
nation has been subjected prompted Sen. Ervin
to call upon his fellow lawmakers to "put the
new technology of computers under human,
legal controls so we do not lose our freedom in
the name of greater efficiency.
In suggesting remedies for the government's
incursion into individual privacy, Lawrence
Spesier, director of the Washington office of the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned
American citizens to refrain from signing
government forms automatically. "Consider
what they're asking," he advised. "Consult your
senator, representative, and the local ACLU."
You have to Say 'No'
Congressman Gallagher, the House's primary
privacy expert agrees. "Somewhere along the
line, I think that the average guy has to say 'no'
to all of the encroachments in his private life."
Krvin believes that the individual citizen
should have access to the government files
which contain information about him. If a
citizen believes that his records are inaccurate or
misleadingly incomplete, he should be permitted

reasonable opportunities to challenge them,"he
said.
The Senator would place additional controls
upon data banks through the creation of a
special, independent ombudsman-style
government agency which would license all data
bank operations, public and private and demand
justification for the records kept. He is also in
favor of equipping computerized data banks
with technical safeguards in order to preserve
the confidentiality of information stored in
them.
Robert P. Henderson, the vice president and
general manager of the electronic data
processing division at Honeywell, Inc. recently
told the National Association of Manufacturers,
"We can make it possible to limit those who are
allowed to put information into a system.
Data vs. Values
"We can even have machines check data
against a given set of values. . . and reject
questionable information. In fact, all input
could be classified as it is received, ranging from
material of public record to top secret.
Despite the feasibility of instituting technical
control, the fact that such data banks to exist is
a deterrant to exercising the First Amendment
rights of free expression. The threat and
ratifications of being catalogued in a government
file constitutes silent, but powerful coercion to
refrain from political dissent.

The Senator would place additional controls

the confidentiality of information stored in
them.

Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher's (D-N.J.)
grim assessment of the pervasive nature of
government surveillance is documented by the
stunning fact that government files contain
sensitive information on one-fourth of this

Infiltration of various political organizations

Desire For Cross-feeding

Data-Bank Network
Senator Sam J. Krvin (D-N.C.) denounced the
emergence of what appears to be a widespread

to call upon his fellow lawmakers to "put the

the name of greater efficiency.

access to a single file that could incriminate him
for the rest of his life.
Data-Bank Network
Senator Sam J. Krvin (D-N.C.) denounced the
emergence of what appears to be a widespread
data bank network. "I believe that in these
systems, where they contain the record of the
individual thoughts, beliefs, habits, altitude's,

and personal activities, there may well rest a
potential for political control and for
intimidation which is alien to a society of free
men."
The police-state implications of the severe
degree of domestic surveillance to which this
nation has been subjected prompted Sen. Ervin
to call upon his fellow lawmakers to "put the
new technology of computers under human,
legal controls so we do not lose our freedom in
the name of greater efficiency.
In suggesting remedies for the government's
incursion into individual privacy, Lawrence
Spesier, director of the Washington office of the
American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) warned
American citizens to refrain from signing
government forms automatically. "Consider
what they're asking," he advised. "Consult your
senator, representative, and the local ACLU."
You have to Say 'No'
Congressman Gallagher, the House's primary
privacy expert agrees. "Somewhere along the
line, I think that the average guy has to say 'no'
to all of the encroachments in his private life."
Krvin believes that the individual citizen
should have access to the government files
which contain information about him. If a
citizen believes that his records are inaccurate or
misleadingly incomplete, he should be permitted

reasonable opportunities to challenge them,"he
said.
The Senator would place additional controls
upon data banks through the creation of a
special, independent ombudsman-style
government agency which would license all data
bank operations, public and private and demand
justification for the records kept. He is also in
favor of equipping computerized data banks
with technical safeguards in order to preserve
the confidentiality of information stored in
them.
Robert P. Henderson, the vice president and
general manager of the electronic data
processing division at Honeywell, Inc. recently
told the National Association of Manufacturers,
"We can make it possible to limit those who are
allowed to put information into a system.
Data vs. Values
"We can even have machines check data
against a given set of values. . . and reject
questionable information. In fact, all input
could be classified as it is received, ranging from
material of public record to top secret.
Despite the feasibility of instituting technical
control, the fact that such data banks to exist is
a deterrant to exercising the First Amendment
rights of free expression. The threat and
ratifications of being catalogued in a government
file constitutes silent, but powerful coercion to
refrain from political dissent.

"Potentially the most serious threat to
individual privacy in America is government.
Chances are the government knows a good deal
about you - more than you realize ... In fact,
it's very unlikely you're not on some
government list..."
Congressman Cornelius E. Gallagher's (D-N.J.)
grim assessment of the pervasive nature of
government surveillance is documented by the
stunning fact that government files contain
sensitive information on one-fourth of this
nation's population.
Infiltration of various political organizations
is one method of gathering such information,
but government agencies which lack the
manpower for direct spying rely heavily upon
the computer to bolster their files.
The remarkable technological advances in
handling tremendous volumes of data has
resulted in governmental ownership or rental of
5277 computers. In 1959, there were only 403.
Information Gathering
In order to gather information on its citizens,
the government employs a Secret Service
computer which stores the names of dossiers of

activist, "malcontents," persistent seekers of
redress, and those who would "embarass" the
President or other government leaders.
Another data bank, compiled by the Justice
Department, issues weekly printouts of national
tension points on racial, class, and political
issues, as well as the individuals and groups
which are involved with them. Peace rallies,
welfare demonstrations, and other expressions
of dissent comprise a "data base" against which
tbe computer can measure the mood of the
nation and the militancy of its citizens. Subjects
are listed as "radical" or "moderate."
The Law Enforcement Assistance
Administration (LEAA) of the .Justice
Department has doled-out millions of dollars to
new local and state computer installations which
are housed in police agencies across the country.
Under a law passed this year, the .Justice
Department is preparing to computerize and
distribute nationally to the police and
prosecutors and courts the names of all persons
charged anywhere with drug offenses. A dnig
user's past record, no matter how slight, will
become instantly available wherever he goes - by
teletyped reports from the computer.
Desire For Cross-feeding
Since a number of government agencies, not
all of which participate in direct domestic
surveillance, keep certain r"cords on private

citizens, there is a great inter-governmental
desire to cross-feed the collected data.
For example, the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, whose own files include
the names of 200,000 private businessmen and
contractors with questionable reputations, is
considering integrating its collection with the
Justice Department's computerized organized
crime file.
Technological effeciency? Yes. But there is
also the very real danger that the judgment of
one file - perhaps a mistaken judgement - will

become the factual assessment of a
computerized monolith. The result: a

decision unknown to its subject and made and
distributed without opportunity for redress. In
