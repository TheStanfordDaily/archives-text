## Economic Aid To Cambodia 
### 
dispatch news service international

Phnom Penh (DNSI) —
Included in President Nixon's
$255 million request for aid to
Cambodia is $70 million worth of
economic aid running until June
30, 19 71. This assistance is
essential to the survival of the Lon
No. 1 regime.
Unlike other aid requests, it is
not being presented as a technical
aid program designed to "win
hearts and minds." A special
economic adviser to the President
who is presently in Phnom Penh,
states simply that "this is purely
economic aid to support the war
effort."
There seems no doubt that the
Lon Nol government is in
serious trouble. Communist forces
have made sweeping gains, and
have forced the establishment of a
"Lon Nol line," which concedes
most of the north and northeast
to the communists. There are
virtually no roads permanently
safe for travel. Reliable estimates
place no more than 20% of the
country under Lon Nol's
control.
Underlying all such political
problems, moreover, are
increasing serious economic ones.
Although American
officials here criticize Sihanouk for
economic "stagnation," they say
that the economy was in fairly
good shape at the time of his fall.
By imposing restriction on luxury

imports, Sihanouk had balanced
imports and exports and there was
over $65 million in foreign
exchange reserves. French
economic advisors to Sihanouk
estimated that the supply of
currency in circulation could be
increased by one-third, from 6
billion riels to 8 billion riels,
without introducing serious
inflation.
The Lon Nol government has
largely financed itself to date
through exactly that—printing
money. Now, however, much of
its reserves has been eaten up.
Uncounted thousands of
hectares of rice and other crops
have been abandoned. Rubber
plantations, producers of most of
Cambodia's foreign exchange, lay
in ruins. Senate investigators
estimate that nearly 1 million
Cambodians have been made
refugees in the last six months,
and the problems of supporting
them add to Lon Nol's
difficulties. The population of
Phnom Penh alone has nearly
doubled to over 1 million. And
the 300,000 Vietnamese, who
played a key role in the
Cambodian economy have been
made refugees or killed.
One of the most serious
pressures on the economy has
resulted from the mushrooming of
the army. Around 30,000 on
March 18, it has now grown to

1 40,000. Plans call for it to be
expanded to 210,000 during
1971.
If the Lon Nol government
manages to survive the coming dry
season, however, the goal/ of
American economic aid will
become clearer. If it continues at
its present relatively low level, it
will be clear that the U.S. is
hedging its bets on Lon Nol and
simply trying its efforts here to
the war in Vietnam.
If as is more likely, however,
the economic aid program is
increased and broadened, one can
foresee an attempt to install a
permanent American presence in
Cambodia similar to that in
Thailand, Laos and South
Vietnam.

Phnom Penh (DNSI) —
Included in President Nixon's
$255 million request for aid to
Cambodia is $70 million worth of
economic aid running until June
30, 19 71. This assistance is
essential to the survival of the Lon
No. 1 regime.
Unlike other aid requests, it is
not being presented as a technical
aid program designed to "win
hearts and minds." A special
economic adviser to the President
who is presently in Phnom Penh,
states simply that "this is purely
economic aid to support the war
effort."
There seems no doubt that the
Lon Nol government is in
serious trouble. Communist forces
have made sweeping gains, and
have forced the establishment of a
"Lon Nol line," which concedes
most of the north and northeast
to the communists. There are
virtually no roads permanently
safe for travel. Reliable estimates
place no more than 20% of the
country under Lon Nol's
control.
Underlying all such political
problems, moreover, are
increasing serious economic ones.
Although American
officials here criticize Sihanouk for
economic "stagnation," they say
that the economy was in fairly
good shape at the time of his fall.
By imposing restriction on luxury

imports, Sihanouk had balanced
imports and exports and there was
over $65 million in foreign
exchange reserves. French
economic advisors to Sihanouk
estimated that the supply of
currency in circulation could be
increased by one-third, from 6
billion riels to 8 billion riels,
without introducing serious
inflation.
The Lon Nol government has
largely financed itself to date
through exactly that—printing
money. Now, however, much of
its reserves has been eaten up.
Uncounted thousands of
hectares of rice and other crops
have been abandoned. Rubber
plantations, producers of most of
Cambodia's foreign exchange, lay
in ruins. Senate investigators
estimate that nearly 1 million
Cambodians have been made
refugees in the last six months,
and the problems of supporting
them add to Lon Nol's
difficulties. The population of
Phnom Penh alone has nearly
doubled to over 1 million. And
the 300,000 Vietnamese, who
played a key role in the
Cambodian economy have been
made refugees or killed.
One of the most serious
pressures on the economy has
resulted from the mushrooming of
the army. Around 30,000 on
March 18, it has now grown to

1 40,000. Plans call for it to be
expanded to 210,000 during
1971.
If the Lon Nol government
manages to survive the coming dry
season, however, the goal/ of
American economic aid will
become clearer. If it continues at
its present relatively low level, it
will be clear that the U.S. is
hedging its bets on Lon Nol and
simply trying its efforts here to
the war in Vietnam.
If as is more likely, however,
the economic aid program is
increased and broadened, one can
foresee an attempt to install a
permanent American presence in
Cambodia similar to that in
Thailand, Laos and South
