self—dignity
Editor, THE DAILY:
As men of respectively proud
Cantonese and Korean descent,
we take strong exception to the
absurdly fallacious assumptions
and assertions by an Archie
Schrotenboer, a white, senior in
communications. Despite Archie's
obvious inadequacy to serve as an
interpreter of ethnic minority
experiences, he condescendingly
misrepresents many aspects of the
racial issue which we, as Asians,
must set straight.
Gene Tom's definition of
racism can only be considered in
the light of his personal
experience. It is absurd for Archie
to cloud the issue by
subordinating the basic,
undeniable fact of white racism in
America through the petty
emphasis of syntactical points.
Archie mistakenly limits the
concept of race to the single
dimension of color, neatly
ignoring the proud, fertile cultures
that are ours by birth. Archie's
error is reflective of white
America's inherent disposition to
deprive ethnic minorities of our
innate right to self-pride and
self-dignity.
Too often, Third World
peoples' vital struggle to attain
self-dignity through ethnic
consciousness is mistakened for
reverse racism, as evidenced by
Archie's trivial attitude toward
the problems of a Chinese, a
Chicano, and a black in relating to
society.
Until white people begin to
appreciate the delicacy and
complexity of interracial
relations, no such idealistic notion
of respect for each other as
''human beings" can be
considered, much less
implemented.

In his two Daily articles Mr.
Barry Wood has been hung up on
one thing: the evils of (other
people's) egos. There are his
thoughts, his moral denunciations,
his ravings of how free he is—
visualizing himself as a "wiggly
tube shape" doing a "cosmic
dance." (I've never met the
man—perhaps he is). Spread over
nearly half a page, under giant
headlines, his name in big black
print, he spouts his "philosophy"
against ego-tripping.
And what, pray tell, is that but
a giant ego-trip?
Isn't it egotistical to assume
anyone reads his columsn, or that
they can influence other's minds?
If he were consistent, Wood
would keep his big typewriter
shut. How can he— one little tube
shape—matter anyway? In fact,
how dare he have the audacity to
even continue living, since he is—
for personal, selfish, and
egotistical reasons— hoarding a
supply of chemicals and minerals
in his body (which plants and

other animals could use), while
consuming precious oxygen and
scarce natural resources just to
keep his unimportant (one might
say worthless— if one were Barry
Wood) personal life supplied with
energy.
The logical consequence of any
anti-ego, anti- in d iv idual
philosophy is human sacrifice, and
death. But I'm sure Mr. Wood is
above logic. Too busy cosmic
frugging.

The attack upon Ambassador
Lodge last Monday was, to say the
least, unfortunate and a great
blow to this fine university and to
the prim iple of free speech.
It is my hope, however, since
President Lyman has promised
prompt and effective action, that
some good may come from even
this deplorable incident.
I would like to take this
opportunity to thank the very
large number of people in the
university community who
expressed very strong support for
the United Nations Conference
and the Hoover Institution.

There is one characteristic
which is consistant among today's
vocal students and young people
in this country. It is their uncanny
ability to be morally indignant
and outraged over yet another
microscopic issue. The
discriminations, persecutions, and
conspiracies purportedly detected
by this generation is second to no
other in history.
The latest of these conspiracies
uncovered is by an anonymous
young lady who perceives that
somehow being a student and a
woman automatically entitles her
to free University contraceptive
health services at someone else's
expense. No natural, rational, or
logical basis for her indignation
suggests itself, other than the
universal desire for something
free. She might additionally go
through the mental and emotional
gymnastics of why books or
tuition are not also provided free
of charge by the University.

As men of respectively proud
Cantonese and Korean descent,
we take strong exception to the
absurdly fallacious assumptions
and assertions by an Archie
Schrotenboer, a white, senior in
communications. Despite Archie's
obvious inadequacy to serve as an
interpreter of ethnic minority
experiences, he condescendingly
misrepresents many aspects of the
racial issue which we, as Asians,
must set straight.
Gene Tom's definition of
racism can only be considered in
the light of his personal
experience. It is absurd for Archie
to cloud the issue by
subordinating the basic,
undeniable fact of white racism in
America through the petty
emphasis of syntactical points.
Archie mistakenly limits the
concept of race to the single
dimension of color, neatly
ignoring the proud, fertile cultures
that are ours by birth. Archie's
error is reflective of white
America's inherent disposition to
deprive ethnic minorities of our
innate right to self-pride and
self-dignity.
Too often, Third World
peoples' vital struggle to attain
self-dignity through ethnic
consciousness is mistakened for
reverse racism, as evidenced by
Archie's trivial attitude toward
the problems of a Chinese, a
Chicano, and a black in relating to
society.
Until white people begin to
appreciate the delicacy and
complexity of interracial
relations, no such idealistic notion
of respect for each other as
''human beings" can be
considered, much less
implemented.

In his two Daily articles Mr.
Barry Wood has been hung up on
one thing: the evils of (other
people's) egos. There are his
thoughts, his moral denunciations,
his ravings of how free he is—
visualizing himself as a "wiggly
tube shape" doing a "cosmic
dance." (I've never met the
man—perhaps he is). Spread over
nearly half a page, under giant
headlines, his name in big black
print, he spouts his "philosophy"
against ego-tripping.
And what, pray tell, is that but
a giant ego-trip?
Isn't it egotistical to assume
anyone reads his columsn, or that
they can influence other's minds?
If he were consistent, Wood
would keep his big typewriter
shut. How can he— one little tube
shape—matter anyway? In fact,
how dare he have the audacity to
even continue living, since he is—
for personal, selfish, and
egotistical reasons— hoarding a
supply of chemicals and minerals
in his body (which plants and

other animals could use), while
consuming precious oxygen and
scarce natural resources just to
keep his unimportant (one might
say worthless— if one were Barry
Wood) personal life supplied with
energy.
The logical consequence of any
anti-ego, anti- in d iv idual
philosophy is human sacrifice, and
death. But I'm sure Mr. Wood is
above logic. Too busy cosmic
frugging.

in this country. It is their uncanny
ability to be morally indignant
and outraged over yet another
microscopic issue. The
discriminations, persecutions, and
conspiracies purportedly detected
by this generation is second to no
other in history.
The latest of these conspiracies
uncovered is by an anonymous
young lady who perceives that
somehow being a student and a
woman automatically entitles her
to free University contraceptive
health services at someone else's
expense. No natural, rational, or
logical basis for her indignation
suggests itself, other than the
universal desire for something
free. She might additionally go
through the mental and emotional
gymnastics of why books or
tuition are not also provided free
of charge by the University.
