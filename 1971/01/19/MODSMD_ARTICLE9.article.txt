In the eighty-one years since his
death, the paintings and drawings
of Vincent Van Gogh have almost
become household images. In no
way does this familiarity diminish
the genius and scope of the
reticent painter from
Groot-Zundert, the Netherlands,
who managed to squeeze some
1600 drawings and paintings into
a span of less than ten years.
The Vincent Van Gogh show,
at the M.H. De Young Memorial
Museum in San Francisco, opened
December 11, 1 970, and runs to
January 31, 19 71. It is
magnificent, stunning, exciting. In
fact, it is one of the most vibrant
shows to appear in San Francisco
for some time. Even the capacity
crowds or waiting in line for two
hours have not dimmed its glory
and each viewing increases one's
appreciation of Van Gogh's
stylistic imagination.
The paintings and drawings on
display at the De Young are part
of the collection of, Dr. Vincent
Van Gogh, nephew and namesake
of the painter. Since 19 45 , Dr.
Van Gogh and his wife have lent
portions of this extensive
collection to travelling
exhibitions, some of which have
appeared in San Francisco. In
1 972, the entire collection of Dr.
Van Gogh will be housed in a new
museum being built in Amsterdam
by the Dutch Government and of
course, will not travel again. So,
this outstanding exhibition of Van
Gogh's drawings and paintings is
unique in the sense that it marks
the last time Americans will be

able to view such a Van Gogh
retrospective in their own
country.
The show has been organized to
follow the superb catalogue and
to parallel the ten creative years
of Van Gogh's troubled life. It is
possible to see the halting
beginning, the growth of form and
color, the influence of the
Impressionists, the exploding
color of Provence and the
inevitable culmination of style
and conflict within Van Gogh.
One psychiatrist has noted that
Van Gogh's last work before his
death, a disturbing threatening
painting of wheatfields, crows,
two cul-de-sacs, and two suns
imbedded in an almost pure cobalt
sky, shows that his suicide was
inevitable.
Whatever the tragedy of Van
Gogh's life, the excitement of his
painting remains and the De
Young show has successfully
caught this mood. It is to repeat, a
most rewarding exhibition.

The variety of nineteenth
century American painting is
always a little overwhelming -
particularly if the viewer tends to
dismiss the American School as
second-rate. At least that is my
experience and it is always
surprising to my rather prejudiced
eye to see how really exciting
American painting can be,
especially if the show is well
organized and visually pleasing.
The nineteenth century
American painting show currently
exhibited at the Stanford Art
Gallery is such just an experience.

This show, which opened January
8, will run to January 31. The 26
paintings are all on loan from the
Arts and Sciences Division of the
International Business Machines
Corporation from New York.
That in itself might be surprising
to some but 1.8.M. has an
exceptionally large and fine
collection of paintings. Certainly,
the Stanford show is well chosen
and offers the viewer great
variety.
The artists range from the still
life painter Charles Bird King
(1785-1 8 6 2 ) to John H.
Twachtman (185 3-1862 ), one of
the organizers of a group of 'Ten
American Painters" who exhibited
their American-type
impressionism together in 1895.
Also represented are Raphaelle
Peale, eldest son of Charles W.
Peale, Washington Allston
(1 7 79-18 43), Asher B. Durand
(1 796-1 8 8 6 ) Thomas Cole
(18 01-1848), Frederick E. Church
(1 826 -1900) Albert Bierstadt
(1830-1 902), Frank Duveneck
(18 48-1919) and Winslow Homer
(1836-1910).
Cole and Durand became the
leading exponents of the Hudson
River School which flourished in
the Hudson River Valley, Upstate
New York and New England.
Bierstadt, a German - American,
became known for his heroic
scenes of the American West,
particularly Yosemite Valley, and
in a sense, Bierstadt is typical of
the European influence, that was
exerted upon American painting
throughout the nineteenth
century.
