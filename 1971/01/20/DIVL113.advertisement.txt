In the future the Daily will run a forum page every Monday
probing some important issue of public or university policy. This
coming Monday, we will devote the editorial section to a discussion
of the Palo Alto "super-block" development project.
Palo Alto residences have a chance to vote on this controversial
project next Tuesday, and we hope the forum will help educate ,
some of those who will cast ballots.
Those wishing to submit letters, columns, graphics, etc. on the
subject should deliver them to the Daily editorial offices in the
Storke Publications building no later than 2 p.m. Saturday. Call
321-2300 x 4632 for further information.
