# The
						Spill: Dying Birds, Ruined Coastline
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Ooze from Monday's record oil spill
in the San Francisco Bay has created an
oily death trap for wildlife in the bay
and along the coastal shoreline.
But through the efforts of hundreds
of Bay Area volunteers armed with
pitchforks and shovels, the endangered
animals are being given the help of a
human hand in their struggle for
survival.
Longhairs and hardhats are working
side by side 2 4 hours a day to undo the
disaster that a collision of two Standard
Oil tankers caused. From Point Reyes
to Half Moon Bay, the habitat of
hundreds of ducks, seals, and fish is
frantically being given a primitive
housecleaning.
More than 1 0,000 bales of straw
have been tossed to the oily sea in an
effort to soak up more than one million
gallons of bunker fuel. On the beaches
hundreds of students and others are
raking golfball-sized globules of oil
from the sand.
The most ambitious of the human
efforts to save the bay's native
inhabitants is a massive bird-cleaning
campaign launched at all beaches in the

area. At the National Audubon
Society's Marin County headquarters,
more than a thousand volunteers began
the bird cleaning operation yesterday.
Carrying large, empty cardboard
boxes, that advertised Christian
Brothers brandy and California
Sunshine Orange Juice, volunteers
combed the black beaches of Marin
county looking for the oily remnants of
birds.
Species Hit Hard
Surf Scooters and Western Grebes
were the two species hardest hit by the
spill. The birds, which find their food
by diving underwater and picking it off
the bottom of the bay, tried their dives
in the oil, and emerged with beaks and
eyes gooed shut, wings hanging limp
and useless.
The Audubon Society issued a
leaflet describing the situation of the
downed birds along with advice for
dealing with them. "Birds will be
hysterical," the leaflet read. "Many will
be blinded and have difficulty
breathing and will be unable to fly. A
person approaching the bird will
further frighten the bird to the point

where it will claw, flap, bite, peck, or
even die."
At the cleaning centers, the birds are
rinsed three times in a light mineral oil
and are swabbed and dried to clean out
nostrils and eyes. During the operation,
the birds wear a green rubber band
around their beaks and are blindfolded.
Few To Survive
Officials at the Audubon
headquarters predict that less than hall'
the birds will survive six weeks. "At the
Santa Barbara slick," said one Audubon
girl, "90 percent of the birds who were
soaked in the oil died."
For many in the volunteer army, the
battle along the bay was an eye-opening
experience. Many seemed to take an
apologetic attitude to what they are
doing. "I heard they needed people to
help the birds," said a 21-year-old USF
student, Julie Slater, "and I figure
that's the least I can do."
For others, the fight for the bay
took on a more important role. A
32-year-old San Francisco sailmaker,
Paul Kroll, violently tossed another
pitchfork load of hay into the water
and said, "I make my living off the
Bay. If it dies, I don't eat."

But even this dogged determination
brought one cynical recollection to
Kroll. "When I was a kid, we'd come
home with fifteen crabs a night from
this bay. That v/as 2 0 years ago. Try it
today and you won't catch shit. Or
maybe I should say that's all you will
catch."
For some workers at the shoreline,
the damage from the spill seemed
minimal. One woman on the overlook
to the bay near Sausalito paused only
long enough to have her husband take
her picture in front of the slick. The
Standard Oil hay loader operator told
something about his attitude to the
whole situation saying, "The kids are
having so much fun out here cleaning it
up I feel bad about taking away their
fun."
For Standard Oil the fun they have
enjoyed because of the spill is nil.
Already the Company faces a $1
million suit from the federal
government. When the General Manager
of the San Francisco Park and
Recreation Department surveyed the
shore at the Marina, he concluded, "It's
a tragedy. And after its all over, we're
going to have to evaluate all our

property. I know that Standard Oil is
paying the bill for all of this."
Hourly Charges
Other bills that Standard may have
to pick up are the wages of many
volunteers that are sending hourly
charges for their help in the clean-up. A
group of lawyers in San Francisco is
beginning to draw up a case for those
volunteers who want Standard Oil to
pick up their bills.

On campus a clearinghouse has been
set up in the KZSU office to
co-ordinate volunteer efforts for
Pacifica, badly hit by the spill. So far,
about 5 0 volunteers have gone to clean
the beaches and help with injured birds.
Students may not have to go clear to
Pacifica for clean-up help after
tomorrow. The Coast Guard estimates
that oil from the spill will spread as far
south as Carmel, and northward into

A NEARLY DEAD DUCK—Volunteers at the National Audubon Society
headquarters in Marin County have sent hundreds of oil-soaked ducks through the
wash in an effort to save them from a soiled death. The majority of the ducks are
not expected to live through the rescue operations which require six weeks to
complete.

PITCHFORK POWER—Tons of straw have been tossed into the bay to stop the pile-up of oil on the beach. The clean-up operations are underway on every major beach
on the coast from Point Reyes to Half Moon Bay. Stanford volunteers can help in the clean-up by going to the Ecology Action Center in the KZSU studios. Students who
want to help should bring their own rakes and hoes to the beach area.
