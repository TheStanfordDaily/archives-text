# Millions Of Acres Sprayed
## Defoliants Wreak Vietnam Havoc 
### CHRIS KATZENBACH 
Since 1961, more than five million acres, of
South Vietnam, an estimated 12 percent of the
country, has been sprayed with chemical defoliants.
The average concentration of the defoliants used
is 1 3 times the concentration recommended by the
Department of Agriculture for United States
domestic uses. This results in the defoliants acting as
herbicides, or plant killers.
A study by Dr. Matthew S. Meselson, of Harvard,
presented to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science last December indicated
that at least a fifth of the 1.2 million acres of
mangrove forest, have been "utterly destroyed." No
vegetation has returned to the defoliated areas.
A few days before the report was read the
Department of Defense announced that the use of
all defoliants in South Vietnam was to be
phased-out by this spring. During the phase-out
period the use of defoliants will be "restricted to
the perimeter of fire bases and U.S. installations or
remote unpopulated areas."
Orange Defoliant
Last April the use of one defoliant, Orange, was
officially prohibited. It has been used, with the
knowledge of the field commanders involved,
several times since.
Orange, White and Blue are the three most
commonly used herbicides in South Vietnam.
Orange is composed of two chemicals 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T. Orange was the most widely used defoliant
in South Vietnam, directed primarily against
hardwood trees and broad-leafed plants. Mangrove
forests have been widely sprayed with this
herbicide.
The Most Toxic
White is a combination of 2,4-D and picloram.
An article by George R. Harvey and Jay D. Mann,
"Picloram in Vietnam," calls White, in its action
towards plant life, "the most toxic chemical yet
discovered." Test areas in Puerto Rico treated with
picloram have remained essentially bare of leaves for
the entire two years of the test.
Blue is used primarily against rice crops in
NLF-controlled areas of South Vietnam. Cacodylic
acid, used in Blue, is 5 4 percent arsenic. Arsenic can

be slowly accumulated in the body over a long
period of time until lethal levels are reached.
Statistics compiled by the Biology Study Group
here last spring in a booklet The Destruction of
Indochina indicate that the damage done to food
and commercial crops in South Vietnam has been
incredible. The U.S. Army admits to using
defoliants on over 5 00,000 acres of South
Vietnamese crops, seven percent of the area under
intensive cultivation, through 1 969. A Japan
Science Council report in 1967 indicated that
defoliation had ruined 3,800 acres of arable land.
U.S. secrecy has prevented the actual figures from
being known.
Rubber Decrease
Although rubber plantations in Vietnam have
never been officially sprayed, defoliants are
probably the major cause for a 25 percent decrease
in per acre yield of rubber between 1960 and 1967.
About one-third of the rubber trees in Cambodia
were damaged by defoliants in April and May of
1 969. Between May and November 1 969 rubber
production fell by 35 to 4 0 percent.
Defoliants have been a major contributor to a 30
percent decline in agricultural production in
Vietnam since the start of the war. In 1 959 South
Vietnam exported 24 6,000 tons of rice. In 1968
850,000 tons of rice had to be imported, 90 percent
of it coming from the U.S.
Defoliation has seriously damaged the tropical
ecology of South Vietnam. Massive use of defoliants
and herbicides causes a disruption in the natural
ecological cycle of the tropical forests, resulting in
the washing away of important nutrients. Pest
species such as giant bamboo, highly resistant to
defoliants, move in and take over the forest areas.
Soil Laterization
The loss of ground cover often results in the
laterization of certain types of soil. Laterite is a
brick-like substance often used for building.
Between 30 and 50 percent of the soil of Vietnam is
of this type.
The effects of defoliants on humans and animals
are uncertain due to the lack of research into the
subject.

A SWOPSI report, The Politics of Technology,
indicates that the Bionetics Research Laboratories
of Lytton Industries knew in 1 966 that 2,4,5-T,
used in Orange, was a strong teratogen
(fetus-deforming agent). At the request of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the
information was suppressed until it was leaked
towards the end of 1969. Producers of 2,4,5-T
claimed that the teratogenicity of the agent was
caused by an impurity "dioxin." Later tests have
shown that both dioxin and 2,4 ,5-T are teratogenic.
Birth Defects
Evidence that defoliants are causing an increase
in birth defects is inconclusive. The Meselson report
indicates that the incidence of two forms of birth
defects, a cleft palate and a spinal deformity,
increased in Saigons Children's Hospital suddenly
after the intensification of spraying began in 1 966.
Dr. John D. Constable, medical member of the
Meselson team, said that this increase could not
legitimately be attributed to herbicides.
SRI Techniques
The Stanford Research Institute has helped
develop techniques such as microencapsulation
where exact quantities of chemicals can be delivered
in a packet to a target. Information on whether or
not the techniques developed at SRI are at present
being used in Indochina is not available. The SRI
Journal of <lune 1 967 , however, mentions a project
for the U.S. Air Force that developed capsules
which could "be released from a jet airplane at a
speed of 1 2 mach without breakage, but do break
on impace at the ground."
Despite reports such as the one by the Biology
Study Group and the Meselson report the Defense
Department denies the seriousness of its defoliation
programs. Recently DDI) spokesman .lerrv W.
Friedman said the defoliation may actually help
parts of the South Vietnamese economy, especially
the forest industry and the small farmers.
"Parts of the hardwood forest have been
destroyed and can now be lumbered," he said. "At
the same time peasants now find room to grow
garden crops right at the edge of the road, where
they have easy access to the city."
Since 1961, more than five million acres, of
South Vietnam, an estimated 12 percent of the
country, has been sprayed with chemical defoliants.

domestic uses. This results in the defoliants acting as
herbicides, or plant killers.
A study by Dr. Matthew S. Meselson, of Harvard,
presented to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science last December indicated
that at least a fifth of the 1.2 million acres of
mangrove forest, have been "utterly destroyed." No
vegetation has returned to the defoliated areas.
A few days before the report was read the
Department of Defense announced that the use of
all defoliants in South Vietnam was to be
phased-out by this spring. During the phase-out
period the use of defoliants will be "restricted to
the perimeter of fire bases and U.S. installations or
remote unpopulated areas."
Orange Defoliant
Last April the use of one defoliant, Orange, was
officially prohibited. It has been used, with the
knowledge of the field commanders involved,
several times since.
Orange, White and Blue are the three most
commonly used herbicides in South Vietnam.
Orange is composed of two chemicals 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T. Orange was the most widely used defoliant
in South Vietnam, directed primarily against
hardwood trees and broad-leafed plants. Mangrove
forests have been widely sprayed with this
herbicide.
The Most Toxic
White is a combination of 2,4-D and picloram.
An article by George R. Harvey and Jay D. Mann,
"Picloram in Vietnam," calls White, in its action
towards plant life, "the most toxic chemical yet
discovered." Test areas in Puerto Rico treated with
picloram have remained essentially bare of leaves for
the entire two years of the test.
Blue is used primarily against rice crops in
NLF-controlled areas of South Vietnam. Cacodylic
acid, used in Blue, is 5 4 percent arsenic. Arsenic can

be slowly accumulated in the body over a long
period of time until lethal levels are reached.
Statistics compiled by the Biology Study Group
here last spring in a booklet The Destruction of
Indochina indicate that the damage done to food
and commercial crops in South Vietnam has been
incredible. The U.S. Army admits to using
defoliants on over 5 00,000 acres of South
Vietnamese crops, seven percent of the area under
intensive cultivation, through 1 969. A Japan
Science Council report in 1967 indicated that
defoliation had ruined 3,800 acres of arable land.
U.S. secrecy has prevented the actual figures from
being known.
Rubber Decrease
Although rubber plantations in Vietnam have
never been officially sprayed, defoliants are
probably the major cause for a 25 percent decrease
in per acre yield of rubber between 1960 and 1967.
About one-third of the rubber trees in Cambodia
were damaged by defoliants in April and May of
1 969. Between May and November 1 969 rubber
production fell by 35 to 4 0 percent.
Defoliants have been a major contributor to a 30
percent decline in agricultural production in
Vietnam since the start of the war. In 1 959 South
Vietnam exported 24 6,000 tons of rice. In 1968
850,000 tons of rice had to be imported, 90 percent
of it coming from the U.S.
Defoliation has seriously damaged the tropical
ecology of South Vietnam. Massive use of defoliants
and herbicides causes a disruption in the natural
ecological cycle of the tropical forests, resulting in
the washing away of important nutrients. Pest
species such as giant bamboo, highly resistant to
defoliants, move in and take over the forest areas.
Soil Laterization
The loss of ground cover often results in the
laterization of certain types of soil. Laterite is a
brick-like substance often used for building.
Between 30 and 50 percent of the soil of Vietnam is
of this type.
The effects of defoliants on humans and animals
are uncertain due to the lack of research into the
subject.

A SWOPSI report, The Politics of Technology,
indicates that the Bionetics Research Laboratories
of Lytton Industries knew in 1 966 that 2,4,5-T,
used in Orange, was a strong teratogen
(fetus-deforming agent). At the request of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the
information was suppressed until it was leaked
towards the end of 1969. Producers of 2,4,5-T
claimed that the teratogenicity of the agent was
caused by an impurity "dioxin." Later tests have
shown that both dioxin and 2,4 ,5-T are teratogenic.
Birth Defects
Evidence that defoliants are causing an increase
in birth defects is inconclusive. The Meselson report
indicates that the incidence of two forms of birth
defects, a cleft palate and a spinal deformity,
increased in Saigons Children's Hospital suddenly
after the intensification of spraying began in 1 966.
Dr. John D. Constable, medical member of the
Meselson team, said that this increase could not
legitimately be attributed to herbicides.
SRI Techniques
The Stanford Research Institute has helped
develop techniques such as microencapsulation
where exact quantities of chemicals can be delivered
in a packet to a target. Information on whether or
not the techniques developed at SRI are at present
being used in Indochina is not available. The SRI
Journal of <lune 1 967 , however, mentions a project
for the U.S. Air Force that developed capsules
which could "be released from a jet airplane at a
speed of 1 2 mach without breakage, but do break
on impace at the ground."
Despite reports such as the one by the Biology
Study Group and the Meselson report the Defense
Department denies the seriousness of its defoliation
programs. Recently DDI) spokesman .lerrv W.
Friedman said the defoliation may actually help
parts of the South Vietnamese economy, especially
the forest industry and the small farmers.
"Parts of the hardwood forest have been
destroyed and can now be lumbered," he said. "At
the same time peasants now find room to grow
garden crops right at the edge of the road, where
they have easy access to the city."
Since 1961, more than five million acres, of
South Vietnam, an estimated 12 percent of the
country, has been sprayed with chemical defoliants.
The average concentration of the defoliants used
is 1 3 times the concentration recommended by the
Department of Agriculture for United States
domestic uses. This results in the defoliants acting as

vegetation has returned to the defoliated areas.
A few days before the report was read the
Department of Defense announced that the use of
all defoliants in South Vietnam was to be
phased-out by this spring. During the phase-out
period the use of defoliants will be "restricted to
the perimeter of fire bases and U.S. installations or
remote unpopulated areas."
Orange Defoliant
Last April the use of one defoliant, Orange, was
officially prohibited. It has been used, with the
knowledge of the field commanders involved,
several times since.
Orange, White and Blue are the three most
commonly used herbicides in South Vietnam.
Orange is composed of two chemicals 2,4-D and
2,4,5-T. Orange was the most widely used defoliant
in South Vietnam, directed primarily against
hardwood trees and broad-leafed plants. Mangrove
forests have been widely sprayed with this
herbicide.
The Most Toxic
White is a combination of 2,4-D and picloram.
An article by George R. Harvey and Jay D. Mann,
"Picloram in Vietnam," calls White, in its action
towards plant life, "the most toxic chemical yet
discovered." Test areas in Puerto Rico treated with
picloram have remained essentially bare of leaves for
the entire two years of the test.
Blue is used primarily against rice crops in
NLF-controlled areas of South Vietnam. Cacodylic
acid, used in Blue, is 5 4 percent arsenic. Arsenic can

be slowly accumulated in the body over a long
period of time until lethal levels are reached.
Statistics compiled by the Biology Study Group
here last spring in a booklet The Destruction of
Indochina indicate that the damage done to food
and commercial crops in South Vietnam has been
incredible. The U.S. Army admits to using
defoliants on over 5 00,000 acres of South
Vietnamese crops, seven percent of the area under
intensive cultivation, through 1 969. A Japan
Science Council report in 1967 indicated that
defoliation had ruined 3,800 acres of arable land.
U.S. secrecy has prevented the actual figures from
being known.
Rubber Decrease
Although rubber plantations in Vietnam have
never been officially sprayed, defoliants are
probably the major cause for a 25 percent decrease
in per acre yield of rubber between 1960 and 1967.
About one-third of the rubber trees in Cambodia
were damaged by defoliants in April and May of
1 969. Between May and November 1 969 rubber
production fell by 35 to 4 0 percent.
Defoliants have been a major contributor to a 30
percent decline in agricultural production in
Vietnam since the start of the war. In 1 959 South
Vietnam exported 24 6,000 tons of rice. In 1968
850,000 tons of rice had to be imported, 90 percent
of it coming from the U.S.
Defoliation has seriously damaged the tropical
ecology of South Vietnam. Massive use of defoliants
and herbicides causes a disruption in the natural
ecological cycle of the tropical forests, resulting in
the washing away of important nutrients. Pest
species such as giant bamboo, highly resistant to
defoliants, move in and take over the forest areas.
Soil Laterization
The loss of ground cover often results in the
laterization of certain types of soil. Laterite is a
brick-like substance often used for building.
Between 30 and 50 percent of the soil of Vietnam is
of this type.
The effects of defoliants on humans and animals
are uncertain due to the lack of research into the
subject.

A SWOPSI report, The Politics of Technology,
indicates that the Bionetics Research Laboratories
of Lytton Industries knew in 1 966 that 2,4,5-T,
used in Orange, was a strong teratogen
(fetus-deforming agent). At the request of the
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare the
information was suppressed until it was leaked
towards the end of 1969. Producers of 2,4,5-T
claimed that the teratogenicity of the agent was
caused by an impurity "dioxin." Later tests have
shown that both dioxin and 2,4 ,5-T are teratogenic.
Birth Defects
Evidence that defoliants are causing an increase
in birth defects is inconclusive. The Meselson report
indicates that the incidence of two forms of birth
defects, a cleft palate and a spinal deformity,
increased in Saigons Children's Hospital suddenly
after the intensification of spraying began in 1 966.
Dr. John D. Constable, medical member of the
Meselson team, said that this increase could not
legitimately be attributed to herbicides.
SRI Techniques
The Stanford Research Institute has helped
develop techniques such as microencapsulation
where exact quantities of chemicals can be delivered
in a packet to a target. Information on whether or
not the techniques developed at SRI are at present
being used in Indochina is not available. The SRI
Journal of <lune 1 967 , however, mentions a project
for the U.S. Air Force that developed capsules
which could "be released from a jet airplane at a
speed of 1 2 mach without breakage, but do break
on impace at the ground."
Despite reports such as the one by the Biology
Study Group and the Meselson report the Defense
Department denies the seriousness of its defoliation
programs. Recently DDI) spokesman .lerrv W.
Friedman said the defoliation may actually help
parts of the South Vietnamese economy, especially
the forest industry and the small farmers.
"Parts of the hardwood forest have been
destroyed and can now be lumbered," he said. "At
the same time peasants now find room to grow
garden crops right at the edge of the road, where
they have easy access to the city."
Since 1961, more than five million acres, of
South Vietnam, an estimated 12 percent of the
country, has been sprayed with chemical defoliants.
The average concentration of the defoliants used
is 1 3 times the concentration recommended by the
Department of Agriculture for United States
domestic uses. This results in the defoliants acting as
herbicides, or plant killers.
A study by Dr. Matthew S. Meselson, of Harvard,
presented to the American Association for the
Advancement of Science last December indicated
that at least a fifth of the 1.2 million acres of
mangrove forest, have been "utterly destroyed." No
