# Noted Professor Dies Unexpectedly
## 
### 
Prof. Leonard I. Schiff, 55,
nationally distinguished physicist,
teacher, and faculty leader, died of an
apparent heart attack yesterday.
Schiff was on his way to lunch when
he collapsed in a parking lot near the
Faculty Club. Several members of the
Medical School faculty and the
Stanford Fire Department quickly
came to his assistance, to no avail.
Executive head of the Department
of Physics from 1 948 to 1966, he was
an active member of the National
Academy of Sciences, serving as
chairman of its nominating committee
in 1965-66.
In 1968, his University colleagues
elected him first chairman of the
Faculty Senate. He concurrently served
as chairman of the Advisory Board, an
elected group of professors concerned
with major academic appointments. He
was the only man ever to hold both
positions concurrently.
Schiff was the author of Quantum
Mechanics, one of the most widely used
texts in physics, now in its third
edition. In 1 966, he received the
Oersted medal of the American
Association of Physics Teachers for his
"notable contributions to the teaching
of physics" and the Dinkelspiel award,
Stanford's highest faculty honor for his
contributions to undergraduate
education.
Prof. Sanford Dornbusch, current
Senate chairman, said Schiff "was a
very special human being. His faculty
colleagues loved him and will miss
him."
Chancellor Wallace Sterling called
his death "a great loss?—the personal
loss of a friend, a distinguished
physicist, and a great University
officer."
Prof. Walter Meyerof, chairman of
the Physics Department, said that
Schiff, in collaboration with Felix
Bloch, "succeeded in building up an
extraordinary department. What is even
more admirable, he kept it together
despite the strains which are generated
when a group of outstanding
individuals associate for a long time.
"He was able to do this, not only
because he was an individual of highest
integrity and fairness, but also because
his colleagues both respect his scientific
ability and his continuing
accomplishments. Such a combination
of administrative and scientific talents
is unique and will be sorely missed by
the University."

Schiff is survived by his wife,
Frances, and two children—a daughter,
Ellen, in training as an x-ray technician
here, and a son, Lee, a graduate student
in physiology at the University. A
private funeral for Schiff will be held
this week with a University-wide
memorial service conducted next week.
Born March 29, 1915, in Fall River,
Mass., Schiff received his bachelor of
engineering in physics in 1933 and
master of science in 1 934 at Ohio State
University, then went to MIT to earn
his Ph.D. in 1937.
After graduating from MIT, he
received a National Research Council
fellowship (1937-38) and later was
awarded a Guggenheim fellowship
(1956-5 7). He taught at the University
of Pennsylvania from 1 94 0-45.
Following World War 11, when he
was active in defense research, Schiff
helped found the American Federation
of Scientists. He strongly supported
international control of atomic energy.
A faculty member since 1947 , he
was the author of more than 140
research papers covering atomic,
nuclear and meson physics as well as
relativity, cosmology, and astrophysics.
He co-authored Our Atomic World in
194 6 and was co-editor of Nuclear
Structure published by Stanford
University Press in 1964.
An internationally known
theoretical physicist, he played a key
role in building the Physics Department
into one of the most distinguished in its
Held nationally.

accomplishments. Such a combination
of administrative and scientific talents
is unique and will be sorely missed by
the University."

Schiff is survived by his wife,
Frances, and two children—a daughter,
Ellen, in training as an x-ray technician
here, and a son, Lee, a graduate student
in physiology at the University. A
private funeral for Schiff will be held
this week with a University-wide
memorial service conducted next week.
Born March 29, 1915, in Fall River,
Mass., Schiff received his bachelor of
engineering in physics in 1933 and
master of science in 1 934 at Ohio State
University, then went to MIT to earn
his Ph.D. in 1937.
After graduating from MIT, he
received a National Research Council
fellowship (1937-38) and later was
awarded a Guggenheim fellowship
(1956-5 7). He taught at the University
of Pennsylvania from 1 94 0-45.
Following World War 11, when he
was active in defense research, Schiff
helped found the American Federation
of Scientists. He strongly supported
international control of atomic energy.
A faculty member since 1947 , he
was the author of more than 140
research papers covering atomic,
nuclear and meson physics as well as
relativity, cosmology, and astrophysics.
He co-authored Our Atomic World in
194 6 and was co-editor of Nuclear
Structure published by Stanford
University Press in 1964.
An internationally known
theoretical physicist, he played a key
role in building the Physics Department
into one of the most distinguished in its
Held nationally.


LEONARD I. SCHIFF
Prof. Leonard I. Schiff, 55,
nationally distinguished physicist,
teacher, and faculty leader, died of an
apparent heart attack yesterday.
Schiff was on his way to lunch when
he collapsed in a parking lot near the
Faculty Club. Several members of the
Medical School faculty and the
Stanford Fire Department quickly
came to his assistance, to no avail.
Executive head of the Department
of Physics from 1 948 to 1966, he was
an active member of the National
Academy of Sciences, serving as
chairman of its nominating committee
in 1965-66.
In 1968, his University colleagues
elected him first chairman of the
Faculty Senate. He concurrently served
as chairman of the Advisory Board, an
elected group of professors concerned
with major academic appointments. He
was the only man ever to hold both
positions concurrently.
Schiff was the author of Quantum
Mechanics, one of the most widely used
texts in physics, now in its third
edition. In 1 966, he received the
Oersted medal of the American
Association of Physics Teachers for his
"notable contributions to the teaching
of physics" and the Dinkelspiel award,
Stanford's highest faculty honor for his
contributions to undergraduate
education.
Prof. Sanford Dornbusch, current
Senate chairman, said Schiff "was a
very special human being. His faculty
colleagues loved him and will miss
him."
Chancellor Wallace Sterling called
his death "a great loss?—the personal
loss of a friend, a distinguished
physicist, and a great University
officer."
Prof. Walter Meyerof, chairman of
the Physics Department, said that
Schiff, in collaboration with Felix
Bloch, "succeeded in building up an
extraordinary department. What is even
more admirable, he kept it together
despite the strains which are generated
when a group of outstanding
individuals associate for a long time.
"He was able to do this, not only
because he was an individual of highest
integrity and fairness, but also because
his colleagues both respect his scientific
ability and his continuing
accomplishments. Such a combination
of administrative and scientific talents
is unique and will be sorely missed by
the University."

Schiff is survived by his wife,
