## Clean It Up 
### 
The massive oil spill in the Bay resulting from the crash
between two Standard Oil tankers demonstrates yet again
how susceptible the environment is to damage trom man's
progress - oriented society.
Although clearly accidental, the tanker crash was not
unavoidable. Both ships had foghorns and radar and they
were being monitored on radar from a Coast Guard shore
station. Why then did the crash occur? Hopefully the C oast
Guard Board of Inquire convening today will provide the
answer. It is clear though that if radar is not enough to
avoid such collisions in heavy fog then the ships had no
business being at sea. The lack of qualified bar pilots on
board is also questionable.
Standard Oil has responded quickly with men, boats and
trucks to try to clean up the mess they created. The damage
being done by almost two million gallons of bunker oil.
however, is clearly beyond the capabilities of the company
and the Coast Guard. Citizens have volunteered to help in
large numbers but they lack the heavy equipment that is
needed. Stanford is sending a dump truck to help today, but
we doubt if enough institutions and companies will respond.
We urge Governor Reagan to declare the coastline in the
San Francisco area a disaster area. This would make federal
help more readily available but more importantly it would
allow him to put the resources of the National Guard
behind the clean-up effort. Their heavy equipment is
needed now and so are more volunteers. People are needed
to clean beaches, oil-soaked birds and spread straw on the
water. If you want to work, call KSAN radio, 986-2825, tor
information or simply go to the Harbor Master's Office in
San Francisco for assignment.
The clean-up operations are underway but they lack a
control and a coordinating agency. It is regrettable that the
state was not able to step in immediately to organize the
clean-up effort. We hope a plan will not be long in coming.
