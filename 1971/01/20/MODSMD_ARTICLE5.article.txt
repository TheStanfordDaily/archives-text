# Sri demonstration
## Wild Weasels and R-52's 
### 
Tonight at the Stanford
Research Institute the men who
designed the electronic equpment
now being used to bomb North
Vietnam will be meeting to hear
an Air Force Colonel evaluate the
success of their work.
In protest of the continued
bombing of Southeast Asia and
the continuing research,
development, and production of
electronic warfare devices in the
Midpeninsula, the Inquisition is
called for a demonstration in
front of SRl's International
Building (on Ravenswood in
Menlo Park) at 7 :00 p.m.
The scheduled event is a secret
briefing sponsored by the local
chapter of the Association of Old
Crows—the "professional" society
dedicated to the advancement of
the art of electronic warfare." The
topic is "Wild Weasels—Their
Mission, Problems, and
Deficiencies." The speaker is
USAF Colonel Gary A. Willard.
According to an Associated
Press release which appeared in
Sunday's Examiner, "An Air
Force F-105 Wild Weasel
fighter-bomber escorting B-5 2
Strategic Bombers .. . fired a
radar-homing Shrike missile at an
enemy radar-controlled SAM
site..." This was the third
straight day of such attacks.
"Wild Weasel" is the military's
nickname for the fighter-bombers
armed with the special electronic
gear designed to assault North
Vietnamese missile sites. The
crews and engineers who use and
design the "Wild Weasel" are
known as "Wild Weasels"
themselves.
The purpose of the "Wild
Weasel" is to destroy Vietnamese
missile and anti-aircraft sites
capable of downing U.S. bombers.
Without the "Weasel," the B-5 2
saturation bombing of Southeast
Asia would prove too costly for
the U.S. Air Force. Attacks on
Missile sites in North Vietnam
foreshadow the resumption of
full-scale saturation-bombing of
North Vietnam, as well as Laos,
Cambodia, and rural South
Vietnam.
Electronic Warfare magazine,
the journal of the Old Crows,
describes tonight's speaker as "Mr.
Weasel himself." Colonel Willard
is also known as the "Dean of
Willie Weasel College," the Nellis
Air Force Base training center for
the use of the radar-homing
missiles in Vietnam.
Tonight's meeting will be held
in SRl's International Building,
inaugurated in 1969. The
International Building serves as
the headquarters of SRl's
em pi re-building and
counterinsurgency operations.
The Old Crows attending
tonight's meeting should be no
strangers to the Stanford
community. Many of them
worked at the Applied Electronics
laboratory (AEL) in 1969. The
classified electronic warfare
research done in AEL was driven
from campus by the April Third
Movement, but continues at SRI.
The AEL work of Stanford
professor William R. Rambo,
director of the Stanford
Electronics La bo ra tories,
continues at SRI.

Less familiar are the other local
Old Crows, most of whom work
in the Stanford-based Peninsula
electronics complex. Included are
the engineers of Applied
Technology, the firm which was
formed by a Stanford group led
by Dr. Rambo and
former-SRI-President E. Finley
Carter. Ramo is now a director of
Applied Tech's parent company,
Itek.
Applied Technology is the
contractor that has designed and
produced the "Wild Weasel" and
its various improvements, and is
still supplying equipment to the

Leonard siegel

Air Force. Applied Tech's
headquarters are on Stanford
Land, on Hillview Ave., in the
Stanford Industrial Park.
Tonight's classified conference
serves to point out the continuing
cooperation between Stanford,
SRI, the military, and local war
industry. The people attending
tonight's meeting will be the very
merchants of death responsible
for the "Wild Weasel" and other
instruments of electronic warfare.
