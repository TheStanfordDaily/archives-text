Police HQ Bombed
SAN FRANCISCO — An explosion damaged a
housing police headquarters near the Hunters Point
Housing Project here last night, but police said there
were no injuries.
Their radio dispatcher warned patrol cars to be on
the lookout for snipers in approaching the blast scene
near the housing project.
Sanctions Ordered
WASHINGTON — The Nixon administration's
campaign to stiffen enforcement of federal welfare
regulations resulted yesterday in the announcement
of financial sanctions April 1 against Indiana and
Nebraska.
HEW contends Indiana violates federal
requirements for the program of aid for dependent
children AFDC in two instances and Nebraska in
three.
The cutoff would affect 98,600 AFDC recipients
in Indiana an 34,300 in Nebraska. But it would not
apply to smaller welfare programs for the blind, aged,
and disabled.
HEW said the main issue is failure by the two
states to increase maximum, theoretical AFDC
payments to reflect recent inflationary price changes.
Chrysler-UAW Agree
DETROIT — Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto
Workers reached contract agreement yesterday just
two hours before a strike deadline, and the company
and union announced they will look into the
possibility of establishing a 4-day 40-hour week.
A six member joint committee will investigate the
feasibility of the four-day work week for 110,000
production workers in the United States and Canada.
Economic terms of the new contract virtually
parallel those won earlier at General Motors, after a
6 7-day strike, and at Ford, where a strike was avoided
through matching of the pattern-setting GM package.
All three carry a first-year wage increase averaging
51 cents hourly, restore an unlimited cost of living

wage escalator in the second and third years and
permit an employee with 30 years service to retire on
a $500 monthly pension at age 58 in the first year
and at 5 6 thereafter.
The average hourly wage in the auto industry
under old contracts was $4 .0 2.
Demos Pick New Leaders
WASHINGTON — Democrats yesterday elected Rep.
Hale Boggs of Louisiana, a moderate long active in
national politics, to be House majority leader in the
new Congress.
Earlier, as expected, they overwhelmingly
nominated Carl Albert of Oklahoma for speaker thus
assuring his formal election Thursday to the top post
in the Democratic controlled House.
The hot contest was for the majority leader post,
which Albert relinquished. Boggs had four opponents,
two of whom divided the votes of a coalition of
liberals pressing for quick changes both in national
priorities and House procedures.
Boggs won on the second ballot with 14 0 votes to
88 for Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona and 17 for
Rep. B.L. Sisk of California.
Rep. Olin E. Teague of Texas upset Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois, 151 to 92, for chairmanship
of the Democratic caucus. Rostenkowski had
presided for four years.
Beatles In Debt?
LONDON — The Beatles, who roared out of a
Liverpool basement eight years ago to turn a fortune
by singing rock songs, now are in the red to the tune
of a million dollars.
Their accounts were in such "lamentable shape,"
said attorney David Hirst, that all four singers, plus
their company, might be unable to meet their tax
commitments.
Hirst, representing Beatle Paul McCartney, 28
year-old guitarist and song writer, made the assertion
in a demand to dissolve the partnership. He said
McCartney also insisted on an accounting of the
millions he, John Lennon, Ringo Star and George
Harrison, have earned in their revolution of the pop
world.

HEW contends Indiana violates federal
requirements for the program of aid for dependent
children AFDC in two instances and Nebraska in
three.
The cutoff would affect 98,600 AFDC recipients
in Indiana an 34,300 in Nebraska. But it would not
apply to smaller welfare programs for the blind, aged,
and disabled.
HEW said the main issue is failure by the two
states to increase maximum, theoretical AFDC
payments to reflect recent inflationary price changes.
Chrysler-UAW Agree
DETROIT — Chrysler Corp. and the United Auto
Workers reached contract agreement yesterday just
two hours before a strike deadline, and the company
and union announced they will look into the
possibility of establishing a 4-day 40-hour week.
A six member joint committee will investigate the
feasibility of the four-day work week for 110,000
production workers in the United States and Canada.
Economic terms of the new contract virtually
parallel those won earlier at General Motors, after a
6 7-day strike, and at Ford, where a strike was avoided
through matching of the pattern-setting GM package.
All three carry a first-year wage increase averaging
51 cents hourly, restore an unlimited cost of living

wage escalator in the second and third years and
permit an employee with 30 years service to retire on
a $500 monthly pension at age 58 in the first year
and at 5 6 thereafter.
The average hourly wage in the auto industry
under old contracts was $4 .0 2.
Demos Pick New Leaders
WASHINGTON — Democrats yesterday elected Rep.
Hale Boggs of Louisiana, a moderate long active in
national politics, to be House majority leader in the
new Congress.
Earlier, as expected, they overwhelmingly
nominated Carl Albert of Oklahoma for speaker thus
assuring his formal election Thursday to the top post
in the Democratic controlled House.
The hot contest was for the majority leader post,
which Albert relinquished. Boggs had four opponents,
two of whom divided the votes of a coalition of
liberals pressing for quick changes both in national
priorities and House procedures.
Boggs won on the second ballot with 14 0 votes to
88 for Rep. Morris K. Udall of Arizona and 17 for
Rep. B.L. Sisk of California.
Rep. Olin E. Teague of Texas upset Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois, 151 to 92, for chairmanship
of the Democratic caucus. Rostenkowski had
presided for four years.
Beatles In Debt?
LONDON — The Beatles, who roared out of a
Liverpool basement eight years ago to turn a fortune
by singing rock songs, now are in the red to the tune
of a million dollars.
Their accounts were in such "lamentable shape,"
said attorney David Hirst, that all four singers, plus
their company, might be unable to meet their tax
commitments.
Hirst, representing Beatle Paul McCartney, 28
year-old guitarist and song writer, made the assertion
in a demand to dissolve the partnership. He said
McCartney also insisted on an accounting of the
millions he, John Lennon, Ringo Star and George
Harrison, have earned in their revolution of the pop
world.
