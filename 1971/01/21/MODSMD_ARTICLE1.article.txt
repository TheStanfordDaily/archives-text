Oil swept under a makeshift barrier of
booms and straw at the "Ecologically
priceless" Bolinas Lagoon yesterday,as
the giant slick continues to ooze along
the coast.
An estimated 5 00,000 to 1.9 million
gallons of oil from the collision of two
Standard tankers now extends north to
Pt. Reyes and south to Pescadero.
Coastal currents are pushing some of the
oil south towards Santa Cruz and
Monterey.
Exhausted volunteers, including
Stanford students, saw oil infiltrate
Bolinas a vital link in the coastal
eco-chain, early Wednesday morning.
However, the outgoing tide swept most
of the oil out.
"I think if we can keep it out another
day, there won't be much damage," .said
Dr. Martin Griffin, director of the
Audubon Canyon Ranch.
Hearings Recess
Coast Guard hearings in San
Francisco investigating the Monday
morning collision were recessed
yesterday after Sierra Club
representatives demanded the right to
cross-examine witnesses as
"representatives of the public interest."
Hearing Officer Lt. Comdr. Roy E.
Nichols refused the pleas of
conservationist lawyers, then passed on
their appeal to Coast Guard Commander
Adm. Chester R. Bender, in Washington.
Meanwhile, coastal wildlife continues

to bog down in the black goo. Dead
birds, fish, shrimp and other marine
animals litter off-shore waters in the
path of the slick. Clean-up stations at
San Francisco, Tiburon, Richmond,
Marin and Pacifica are treating seabirds
with mineral oil and corn meal. Experts
estimate that only about 3% of the
cleaned-up creatures can be expected to
survive.
Standard Clean-Up Underway
Standard Oil reports it has 500 men
on the beaches, working alongside the
thousands of volunteers. The company is
using 4 2 boats and 6 3 trucks to aid in the
clean-up.
According to an Examiner story,
Standard has been developing a master
plan for oil spill control for over a year.
However, clean-up efforts seem
uncoordinated in many areas, with
inexperienced volunteers and
inadequate equipment.
"We started fine," says James
Keating, assistant general manager of
operations at the Richmond refinery,
"But our people got isolated. We didn't
anticipate the spill would be over such a
wide area, from one end of the bay to the
other."
Oil Threatens Wildlife
Although Standard faces up to $1
million in fines, naturalists can put no
price on the damage to wildlife. Bolinas
Lagoon, one of the last major nesting
grounds for the great blue heron and

wildfowl. Oil could damage the marsh
salt grass, the start of the food chain for
the entire lagoon.
Oil is closing in on several other
priceless wildlife refuges, including Pt.
Reyes National Seashore. Richardson
Bay, an arm of San Francisco Bay, and
the Pillar Point Breakwater, about 2 0
miles south of the city, both gathering

spots for seabirds, are threatened.
In response to the disaster, William
Ruckelhaus, director of the new federal
Environmental Protection Agency is
sending an investigation team to the Bay
and will come here himself within ten
days.
The Coast Guard has indicated that it
will increase its support of two bills
aimed at providing greater protection for
inland waters such as the Bav.

Oil swept under a makeshift barrier of
booms and straw at the "Ecologically
priceless" Bolinas Lagoon yesterday,as
the giant slick continues to ooze along
the coast.
An estimated 5 00,000 to 1.9 million
gallons of oil from the collision of two
Standard tankers now extends north to
Pt. Reyes and south to Pescadero.
Coastal currents are pushing some of the
oil south towards Santa Cruz and
Monterey.
Exhausted volunteers, including
Stanford students, saw oil infiltrate
Bolinas a vital link in the coastal
eco-chain, early Wednesday morning.
However, the outgoing tide swept most
of the oil out.
"I think if we can keep it out another
day, there won't be much damage," .said
Dr. Martin Griffin, director of the
Audubon Canyon Ranch.
Hearings Recess
Coast Guard hearings in San
Francisco investigating the Monday
morning collision were recessed
yesterday after Sierra Club
representatives demanded the right to
cross-examine witnesses as
"representatives of the public interest."
Hearing Officer Lt. Comdr. Roy E.
Nichols refused the pleas of
conservationist lawyers, then passed on
their appeal to Coast Guard Commander
Adm. Chester R. Bender, in Washington.
Meanwhile, coastal wildlife continues

to bog down in the black goo. Dead
birds, fish, shrimp and other marine
animals litter off-shore waters in the
path of the slick. Clean-up stations at
San Francisco, Tiburon, Richmond,
Marin and Pacifica are treating seabirds
with mineral oil and corn meal. Experts
estimate that only about 3% of the
cleaned-up creatures can be expected to
survive.
Standard Clean-Up Underway
Standard Oil reports it has 500 men
on the beaches, working alongside the
thousands of volunteers. The company is
using 4 2 boats and 6 3 trucks to aid in the
clean-up.
According to an Examiner story,
Standard has been developing a master
plan for oil spill control for over a year.
However, clean-up efforts seem
uncoordinated in many areas, with
inexperienced volunteers and
inadequate equipment.
"We started fine," says James
Keating, assistant general manager of
operations at the Richmond refinery,
"But our people got isolated. We didn't
anticipate the spill would be over such a
wide area, from one end of the bay to the
other."
Oil Threatens Wildlife
Although Standard faces up to $1
million in fines, naturalists can put no
price on the damage to wildlife. Bolinas
Lagoon, one of the last major nesting
grounds for the great blue heron and

wildfowl. Oil could damage the marsh
salt grass, the start of the food chain for
the entire lagoon.
Oil is closing in on several other
priceless wildlife refuges, including Pt.
Reyes National Seashore. Richardson
Bay, an arm of San Francisco Bay, and
the Pillar Point Breakwater, about 2 0
miles south of the city, both gathering

spots for seabirds, are threatened.
In response to the disaster, William
Ruckelhaus, director of the new federal
Environmental Protection Agency is
sending an investigation team to the Bay
and will come here himself within ten
days.
The Coast Guard has indicated that it
will increase its support of two bills
aimed at providing greater protection for
inland waters such as the Bav.
