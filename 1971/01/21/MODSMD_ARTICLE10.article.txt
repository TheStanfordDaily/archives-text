Highway 4 Battle Rages
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Under an air cover of U.S.
helicopter gunships, Cambodian infantrymen fought
entrenched North Vietnamese Wednesday in what may be a
decisive battle for Cambodia's lifeline, Highway 4.
The fighting raged 60 miles southwest of Phnom Penh at the
entrance to Pich Nil Pass, the last stronghold along Highway 4
still held by enemy forces.
The Cambodians acknowledged a severe battering but their
field commander, Brig. Gen. Sosthene Fernandez, repeated his
claim that the capture of the mountain gateway was imminent.
If so, it was not immediately evident. The Cambodian effort
to take to pass appeared blunted by the enemy entrenched in
bunkers that defied the aerial pounding.
''Keep Courts Quiet 9
WASHINGTON — Justice William O. Douglas spoke out
sharply Wednesday against defendants who bring street brawl
tactics to the courtroom and vilify trial judges.
Douglas, who is regarded as the Supreme Court's most
liberal member, said it is basic to the Western tradition that a
courtroom be "a hallowed place of quiet dignity as far removed
as possible from the emotions of the street."
The justice denounced courtroom "vulgarity" as he
delivered a unanimous opinion for the Supreme Court, that
condemned a defendant's personal attack on a Pennsylvania
trial judge.
The justice said Judge Fiok, whose "exemplary patience"
was saluted by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger in a concurring

opinion, would have been correct if he had punished Mayberry
for contempt during the trial.
"A judge cannot be driven out of a case," Douglas said.
However, since Judge Fiok waited until the trial was over to
charge Mayberry with contempt, Douglas said, the judge
should have stepped aside so a colleague not "reviled by the
contemnor" could sit in judgment on the contempt issue.
Death Penalty Dropped
HARRISBURG — The outgoing state attorney general
declared the death penalty abolished in Pennsylvania
Wednesday, asserting it was cruel and inhuman punishment
and as such is prohibited by the U.S. Constitution.
In his ruling, Atty. Gen. Fred Speaker said he was acting in
accord with his oath of office, which "obliges me to act upon a
constitutional mandate when the courts remain silent.
"As attorney general, I have the responsibility to uphold the
state and federal constitution," Speaker said. "That is the sole
reason for my action."
British Workers Strike
LONDON — Britons got by in the first day of the nation's
postal strike by either not writing or using privately run mail
services that charged 2 4 cents to carry a letter.
Telephone and telegraph services also were disrupted in
some areas Wednesday.
In Manchester, another "pirate" post office as the strikers
call the private services offered free delivery of mail for doctors
and blood banks in the area.
