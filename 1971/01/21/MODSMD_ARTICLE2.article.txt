# Dying Beaches

### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
PACIFIC A—By late yesterday
afternoon most of the heroics were over.
The long night battle against the once
seemingly endless waves of bunker oil is
now in the past. The present and near
future for this small seacoast town is a
dark, straw-strewn beach reeking of
petroleum and empty of its birds.
Hundreds of volunteers still worked
the beach—pitching, pushing, raking the
oil-absorbent straw back into the Pacific
to capture the pools that still lingered.
Even by mid-afternoon there really
wasn't much left to do, save for
contemplation of the very real
catastrophe that had hit every beach and
town from Half Moon Bay in the South
to Bolinas Bay in the North. Agonized
townspeople and the tired volunteers
silently walked along the beach.
Battle Raged
Much of the action was over now, but
for hours a battle had raged to save the
lives of hundreds of birds, entrapped by
the slick because they had no where else
to go. For hours volunteers desperately
fought to clear a once-beautiful beach of
a thick coat of black goo.
The largest oil spill in the history of
San Francisco Bay had left its smear on
Pacifica. Linda Mar was the major beach
in San Mateo County with the largest
influx of the spilled oil, leaked from the
Oregon Standard, one of the ships
involved in the collision Monday.
The oil, in large, thick, black

coagulated patches started coming
ashore at Linda Mar beach sometime
before 7 a.m. Tuesday. An unidentified
girl discovered the slick and started
rescuing poisoned birds on her own.
Within hours help, and some of the
basic materials that are man's inadequate
apparatus to combat his own pollution,
arrived on the beaches.
Youthful Volunteers
All through the long day and longer
night youthful volunteers from
Stanford, Hayward, Santa Clara, San
Francisco State, Canada College,
Foothill, and all the nearby high schools
and grade schools toiled at the Linda Mar
and Rockaway beaches.
Hugh spotlights were stationed on
each beach throughout the early
Wednesday morning hours as the
volunteers shoveled tons of oil-soaked
straw into piles, which were hauled away
by dump truck. Employees from
Standard Oil's refinery at Richmond
operated bulldozers and a gigantic crane.
One Standard employee, Charles
Ferguson, told the Palo Alto Times that
he was motivated to work hard simply
because of the devotion and
unselfishness of the volunteers.
By da wn, oil was still washing ashore,
but new straw was lining the beach.
Fresh volunteers spread and re-spread
the straw, till hours later when a relative
end was in sight.
All the while hundreds of dying
sea-birds were being rescued from their
polluted home, the now oily surf. By
midnight Tuesday more than 200 had
been retrieved, cleaned, and trucked to
the San Francisco Humane Society.
Most that washed ashore were dead or
dying and, pathetically, for many birds,
the valiant rescue efforts were to be in
vain. Attempts were made to rescue
some birds from the offshore waters.
A 25-year old San Franciscan swam
out into the oily sea nearly 100 yards to
save a bird in distress off Linda Mar
beach, and nearly drowned. He was
rescued by a friend who was able to bring
him to shore.
Dazed
Not everyone worked at the
oil-soaked straw. Some tended beach
fires and brought pick-up loads of
sandwiches and coffee to the volunteers.
Some people simply walked along the
beaches, dazed at the enormity of the
pollution.
By mid afternoon some oil slicks had
spread past Pacifica to Pillar Point, near
Half Moon Bay, and volunteers waited in
sad anticipation of the high tide that
could wash ashore hundreds more dying
birds.
But by 5:00 Wednesday afternoon,
the major portions of Pacifica's share of
the spill had been captured or merely
reeked in the sands. High tide saw the
end of the major pollution. People began

talking about how it was still so much
worse up North.
Some volunteers who arrived in the
late afternoon seemed disappointed that
there was relatively little to do. They
seemed unaware that the battle for
Linda Mar was as tragic, frustrating, and
overwhelming as the more publicized
anti-pollution efforts to the north.
Personal Battleground
For most of the volunteers that
remained working at Pacifica, Linda Mar
was their personal battleground in a
coast-long fight against the spill. Some
would not go north, even with most of
the heavy toil ended at Linda Mar.
It was a battle that grudgingly and
reluctantly swung in favor of the
volunteers. But even then they would not be
completely victorious. "All the damn
straw in San Mateo County is not going

to clean the sand of this oil," mourned a
young straw-spreader.
By nightfall many were still working
at the waves, the remaining pools of oil,
and the straw. One Stanford
undergraduate, who worked at Pacifica
since early morning, still tossed
pitchforks of straw into the waves. "It's
my beach too," he softly declared.
Some did begin to leave for the
despoiled beaches to the North. But the
time for contemplation of the tragedy
had set in, and it was clearly evident in
the saddened faces of the young
volunteers and the grim townspeople as
they trudged the sands of Linda Mar
beach. "It's so sad," complained a
frustrated, tired oil-stained coed. "The
only thing we can do is wait for the
spill."
