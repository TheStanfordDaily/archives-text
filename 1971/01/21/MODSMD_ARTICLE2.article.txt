# Dying Beaches

### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
PACIFIC A—By late yesterday
afternoon most of the heroics were over.
The long night battle against the once
seemingly endless waves of bunker oil is
now in the past. The present and near
future for this small seacoast town is a
dark, straw-strewn beach reeking of
petroleum and empty of its birds.
Hundreds of volunteers still worked
the beach—pitching, pushing, raking the
oil-absorbent straw back into the Pacific
to capture the pools that still lingered.
Even by mid-afternoon there really
wasn't much left to do, save for
contemplation of the very real
catastrophe that had hit every beach and
town from Half Moon Bay in the South
to Bolinas Bay in the North. Agonized
townspeople and the tired volunteers
silently walked along the beach.
Battle Raged
Much of the action was over now, but
for hours a battle had raged to save the
lives of hundreds of birds, entrapped by
the slick because they had no where else
to go. For hours volunteers desperately
fought to clear a once-beautiful beach of
a thick coat of black goo.
The largest oil spill in the history of
San Francisco Bay had left its smear on
Pacifica. Linda Mar was the major beach
in San Mateo County with the largest
influx of the spilled oil, leaked from the
Oregon Standard, one of the ships
involved in the collision Monday.
The oil, in large, thick, black

coagulated patches started coming
ashore at Linda Mar beach sometime
before 7 a.m. Tuesday. An unidentified
girl discovered the slick and started
rescuing poisoned birds on her own.
Within hours help, and some of the
basic materials that are man's inadequate
apparatus to combat his own pollution,
arrived on the beaches.
Youthful Volunteers
All through the long day and longer
night youthful volunteers from
Stanford, Hayward, Santa Clara, San
Francisco State, Canada College,
Foothill, and all the nearby high schools
and grade schools toiled at the Linda Mar
and Rockaway beaches.
Hugh spotlights were stationed on
each beach throughout the early
Wednesday morning hours as the
volunteers shoveled tons of oil-soaked
straw into piles, which were hauled away
by dump truck. Employees from
Standard Oil's refinery at Richmond
operated bulldozers and a gigantic crane.
One Standard employee, Charles
Ferguson, told the Palo Alto Times that
he was motivated to work hard simply
because of the devotion and
unselfishness of the volunteers.
By da wn, oil was still washing ashore,
but new straw was lining the beach.
Fresh volunteers spread and re-spread
the straw, till hours later when a relative
end was in sight.
