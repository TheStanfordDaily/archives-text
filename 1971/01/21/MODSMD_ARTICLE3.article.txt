# Nine Arrested As Police, Dissidents Clash At SRI
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN LANG ATWOOD 
Riot police used clubs and mace to
turn back a crowd of 150
demonstrators who had gathered at the
Stanford Research Institute's (SRI)
Menlo Park facility last night to protest
a scientific meeting. Nine people were
arrested and several demonstrators and
police suffered minor injuries.
Shortly after the demonstration at
SRI was broken up, a small group of
people broke 20 windows in five
buildings on campus. According to
Stanford police no one was
apprehended.
The SRI demonstration began at the
parking lot entrance of the
International Building at 7 p.m., where
peaceful picketing was accompanied by
anti-war chants. The scientists allegedly
design electronic equipment which
enables bombers to detect and destroy
radar sites. The demonstrators marched
across the entrance for an hour, as the
riot-equipped police periodically
pushed them back to form aisles for
incoming and out-going traffic.
Tension mounted each time the
aisles were formed; the exchange
between police and demonstrators
became increasingly physical. At 8
p.m., when an aisle was formed for
perhaps the 10 th time, one
demonstrator locked his legs and arms
with a deputy. They grappled briefly,
fell to the ground, and the crowd
responded by coming to the
demonstrator's aid.
The club-wielding police fought to
disperse the crowd, and as individual
fighting erupted, the initial arrests were
made. Jim Shoch, Stuart Purkey and
(leoff White were taken into custody.
After the first wave of arrests,
several demonstrators pelted squad cars
with rocks. As floodlights lit the street,
Menlo Park Police Chief Victor
Cizanckas spoke to the demonstrators
from a squad car public address system,
and declared that the demonstration
constituted an unlawful assembly, and
ordered that it be dispersed within two
minutes.
The crowd began to disperse, but

several protestors lingered behind, and
continued to throw rocks at police cars.
At this point approximately four
policemen began to pursue the
retreating crowd eastward, along
Ravenswood Ave., while other police
yelled at them to discontinue the chase.
The pursuing officers eventually
complied, but in the interim, Mary
Cummings was arrested.
In the aftermath of the
demonstration, squad cars, equipped
with high-powered lights, patrolled in
front of the International Building in
order to prevent large crowds from
gathering.
A San Mateo County Sheriff's Dept.
helicopter, requested by Menlo Park
police, was used to light up the area
with searchlights during the
disturbance. One of the orders to
disperse was also issued from the
helicopter.
A short time after the main body of
demonstrators had left SRI, an
unknown group of persons went along
Via Crespi on the campus and broke a
total of twenty windows in the
following buildings: McCullough
Engineering, Varian Lab., Aeronautics
and Astronautics and the Electronics
Research Lab.
Campus police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff's units responded to the
area, but the group fled before they
arrived.
Meanwhile, Bill Evers talked to
Daily reporters from the San Mateo
County Jail, and gave the following
account of his arrest.
"At the conclusion of the
demonstration, I walked down
Ravenswood towards El Camino. As I
approached the railroad tracks, some
cops pulled up and stopped some
people behind me.
"I asked them (thepolice) if I could
observe what was taking place, and
when they said no, I crossed the street
to the SRI side. I met some
neighborhood kids of junior high and
elementary school age, and when they
asked me what was going on, I told
them about the demonstration at the
International Building.

"Then the police crossed the street
to disperse me and the kids."
Evers was arrested for failure to
disperse' and resisting arrest. He was
released on $365 bail late last night.
The nine people who were arrested
and charged were Mary Cummings, 20,
felonious assault, felonious battery;
Geoff White, 22, felonious assault,
felonious battery, resisting arrest;
James Shoch, 23, felonious assault,
felonious battery, resisting arrest;
Stuart Purkey, 23, felonious assault,
felonious battery, resisting arrest; Gary
Salt, a Stanford student, 25 , malicious
mischief, throwing a missile at a moving
vehicle (felony); John Dolly, 24,
felonious assault, throwing a missile at
a moving vehicle; Charles Robert
Lorence, 23, refusal to identify himself;
Bill Evers 22, failure to disperse,
resisting arrest.
Local police agencies were fully
mobilized for the demonstration to
augment SRI security guards. Menlo
Park had about 25 officers in riot gear
and about 15 men in plainclothes and
blazers. They Vvere assisted by at least
20 San Mateo County Sheriff's
Deputies also in riot gear.
