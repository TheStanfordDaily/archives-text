# Sensual Sleepers Buy Waterbeds
## 
### FRED MANN 
Ten days ago, Mick Heckman, a fifth
year electrical engineering student paid
$7 for a classified ad in the Daily. "Enjoy
exciting, sensual, hedonistic living—buy
a water bed," it said.
In the next few days, Heckman's
short-lived attempt at private enterprise
will come to an end. But he is suffering a
fate most businessmen dream of
suffering—he is too successful. Phone
calls at all hours of the day and night
from prospective customers for water
bedsare driving him up the wall.
Unfortunately, the credit can not
be given to the strength of Daily
advertising. The product is selling itself.
Heckman's price, $29, is the lowest in
town, and his sales figures are
astronomical. (He requested the actual
number of sales not be published.) Yet
even with such unparalleled success, he is
far from cornering the student market.
Water bed stores are popping up
throughout the bay area, and those in
the booming industry expect 10 or 15
new distributors to join the field in the
next two weeks.
Water Bag
A water bed is nothing more than a
vinyl air mattress with reinforced seams,
filled with water from an ordinary
garden hose. A single mattress holds
close to 150 gallons of water while the
king size can normally hold up to 350
gallons.
The bed rolls gently under the sleeper

as he moves, and produces a floating or
suspending sensation when one lies flat.
Most distributors recommend placing
the mattress on a heavy wooden frame
with an enclosed bottom to stop the
eventual spreading of the bag and to
increase the waving motion of the water.
The introduction of hundreds of
gallons of water into the home may
obviously cause numerous problems,
some of which the water bed companies
have tried to ease. Although most
mattresses carry guarantees of up to 5 0
years, the possibility of rippage or
puncture is great. Companies recently
have been distributing small patches
with each bed to repair minor holes. The
water pressure is not so great that the
bed would have to be totally drained to
fix a small leak.
Health Hazards
The bursting of a seam however,
would cause severe water damage in the
room. Santa Clara County fire marshalls
have condemned the beds as health
hazards because of the possibility of
electrocution. Some faulty heating units
used to warm the water could damage
the plastic, causing a leak and triggering a
possibly fatal burst of water near an
electrical outlet.
Many distributors are urging the use
of an insulation pad of foam rubber on
top of t he mattress instead of the various
heating devices.
The wooden frame, if used, would
contain the major part of any spill, but it

also causes problems by distributing the
entire weight of the bed (in some cases
up to a ton) at only four points. Such
weight is more than many floors will
support.
Representatives from University
dormatories are currently exploring the
safety of water beds, wondering what
troubles, if any, the dorms are in for.
Variation In Price
Beds being sold commercially vary
greatly in quality and price. Different
firms offer models from under $30 to
over $3 00, and the strength of the plastic
in some products has come under
question by distributors.
Some beds made of clear plastic have
become favorites because of their
possible ust> as stages for bed time with
bright lights and light shows. Colored
oils added to the water, the clear
mattress becomes a freaky, undulating
toy for children of all ages.
The affect of the oils on the plastic
and any cleansing agent that might be
necessarv to insure against the growth of
algae are still uncertain. Those selling
only colored Union Carbide vinyl feel
their product is safer and proven.
According to Jack Strong, .owner of
Strong Plus of Mountain View, "To
make it (the mattress) clear means you
have to take some thing out of it."
Bridging The (Jap
The popularity of the beds is quickly
spreading across cultural and
generational lines.
In mid-October when the beds were

first introduced in the area, the only
buyers were hip couples and young
people. Today, water beds are also being
purchased by well to do families looking
for a living room conversation piece,and
elderly couples anxious to try out the
advertised "sensual pleasures" of the
bed.
The Emporium and Macy's have no
current plans to carry them, but the ritzy
Cabana Hotel installed its first one
yesterday.
Lovers' Delight
Companies are making the most of
the many possible advantages of their
new product, inviting customers to
"Live and Love on Liquid Luxury."
Many owners claim the love making
function of the water bed is its biggest
asset. "You can achieve sexual positions
acrobats only dream about," says one.
Another claimed his new bed was the life
of his recent party, with guests rolling
for hours. The problem came when no
one would leave to let him roll and hug in
private.
"It's the most comfortable bed I've
ever had," said Al Demmer, owner (if a
queen size clear bed. "It's great for
backaches. It was a little bit weird at
first, but now it has lost its novelty.
People still come over to look at it and
try it out, but to me it's just a bed."
It's trailer-mate however, was not as
pleased with the product when he tried
it. Thoroughly ripped after an evening
with friends, he collapsed on the rolling
mattress, only to wake up in a
nightmarish dream that he had drowned.
