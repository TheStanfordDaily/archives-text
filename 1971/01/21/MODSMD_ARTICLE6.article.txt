## Notes On Franklin Affair 
### 
h. /. kahn

1. A fantasy in one act: Richard
Lyman, lying, dreams he is
Kingman Brewster, President of
Yale."I do not," he says to all who
will listen, "believe that H. Bruce
Franklin car. r jeive a fair hearing
in any court in this community."
The dream is broken by the sound
of trusses (trustees?) snapping.
2. Questions for an erstwhile
professor of English history:
Heckling at a public meeting is a
crime? Successful heckling at a
public meeting is a crime? If
Robert McAfee Brown, inspired by
Father Berrigan, had stood,
pointed, and cried, "Shame!
Shame!" and had been joined by
the other liberal, anti-war ladies
and gentlemen in the audience to
the point where in fact the speaker
had been shamed, would he (and
they) have been charged in like
manner?
3. Reflections on tenure and
other faculty privileges: When I
accepted my first post as Lecturer
at the University of London, I was
told by my colleagues that the only
way I could be fired was by
committing an unnatural act with
the Chancellor on Visitors Day
before the Queen Mother. The case
can be argued, I think, but either
way it is a far cry from the
antiseptic morality which
threatens a man's position (or his
pay) for heckling in an open
meeting.
4. Reflections on Paragraph 15
of the Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure,
concerning punishment for
"personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate

functions within the University
community .. . Bruce Franklin
is a revolutionary. He avows the
need to resolve contradictions
through struggle and the need to
define contradictions through a
materialist analysis of objective
historical conditions. What he
avows he practices—in the
classroom, in the audience, and, 1
suppose, in his private life too. He
encourages his students to do the
same—in the classroom, in the
audience, in private life too. (When
was the last time any of the
members of the Advisory Board of
the Academic Council or our
president attended one of Mr.
Franklin's classes?) The point is
that it is just possible to arrive at
the conclusion that Bruce
Franklin's conduct at Dinkelspiel
substantially enhanced the
performance of his "appropriate
functions within the University
community."
5. A note to presidential letter
readers: Mr. Lyman's letter to Mr.
Franklin suggests clearly that in the
administration's mind there is no
question of guilt in this case, only
one of the degree of punishment to
be meted out and by whom. This
being the case, I feel compelled to
assist in the search for a proper
penalty.
6. An appropriate punishment
of H. Bruce Franklin: A dock in
salary, the portion withheld to be
applied immediately to the
establishment of a Stanford
Committee to Investigate the War
Crimes of H.Cabot Lodge.
7. Remembrance of things past:
"A leader," says the majority
judgment of the Tokyo War Crimes

Tribunal, "must take affirmative
acts to prevent war crimes or
dissociate himself from the
government. If he fails to do one or
the other, then by the very act of
remaining in a government of a
state guilty of war crimes, he
becomes a war criminal."
8. There are 11 officially
sanctioned U.S. military practices
in violation of international law
established by the Hague and
Geneva Conventions.
9. Remembrance of things
recent: Mr. Lodge insisted, upon
accepting the Saigon
ambassadorship in 1 963, on full
control of all aspects of U.S.
operations incluidng military
prosecution of the war.
10. A brief nod to praxis:
Richard Falk, Milbank Professor of
International Law and Practice at
Princeton, emphasises "the
obligatioi. of resistance for the
citizen, if the evidence is strong,
that the state is engaged in criminal
acts."
11. A final fantasy in one act:
ILL. Kahn, lying, daydreams and
muses, to no one in particular, that
H. Bruce Franklin cannot receive a
fair hearing in any court in this
community ...
(Harold Kahn is an associate
professor in the History
Department.)

concerning punishment for
"personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's
performance of his appropriate

functions within the University
community .. . Bruce Franklin
is a revolutionary. He avows the
need to resolve contradictions
through struggle and the need to
define contradictions through a
materialist analysis of objective
historical conditions. What he
avows he practices—in the
classroom, in the audience, and, 1
suppose, in his private life too. He
encourages his students to do the
same—in the classroom, in the
audience, in private life too. (When
was the last time any of the
members of the Advisory Board of
the Academic Council or our
president attended one of Mr.
Franklin's classes?) The point is
that it is just possible to arrive at
the conclusion that Bruce
Franklin's conduct at Dinkelspiel
substantially enhanced the
performance of his "appropriate
functions within the University
community."
5. A note to presidential letter
readers: Mr. Lyman's letter to Mr.
Franklin suggests clearly that in the
administration's mind there is no
question of guilt in this case, only
one of the degree of punishment to
be meted out and by whom. This
being the case, I feel compelled to
assist in the search for a proper
penalty.
6. An appropriate punishment
of H. Bruce Franklin: A dock in
salary, the portion withheld to be
applied immediately to the
establishment of a Stanford
Committee to Investigate the War
Crimes of H.Cabot Lodge.
7. Remembrance of things past:
"A leader," says the majority
judgment of the Tokyo War Crimes

Tribunal, "must take affirmative
acts to prevent war crimes or
dissociate himself from the
government. If he fails to do one or
the other, then by the very act of
remaining in a government of a
state guilty of war crimes, he
becomes a war criminal."
8. There are 11 officially
sanctioned U.S. military practices
in violation of international law
established by the Hague and
Geneva Conventions.
9. Remembrance of things
recent: Mr. Lodge insisted, upon
accepting the Saigon
ambassadorship in 1 963, on full
control of all aspects of U.S.
operations incluidng military
prosecution of the war.
10. A brief nod to praxis:
Richard Falk, Milbank Professor of
International Law and Practice at
Princeton, emphasises "the
obligatioi. of resistance for the
citizen, if the evidence is strong,
that the state is engaged in criminal
acts."
11. A final fantasy in one act:
ILL. Kahn, lying, daydreams and
muses, to no one in particular, that
H. Bruce Franklin cannot receive a
fair hearing in any court in this
community ...

professor in the History
Department.)

Lyman, lying, dreams he is
Kingman Brewster, President of
Yale."I do not," he says to all who
will listen, "believe that H. Bruce

The dream is broken by the sound
of trusses (trustees?) snapping.
2. Questions for an erstwhile
professor of English history:
Heckling at a public meeting is a
crime? Successful heckling at a
public meeting is a crime? If
Robert McAfee Brown, inspired by
Father Berrigan, had stood,
pointed, and cried, "Shame!
Shame!" and had been joined by
the other liberal, anti-war ladies
and gentlemen in the audience to
the point where in fact the speaker
had been shamed, would he (and
they) have been charged in like
manner?
3. Reflections on tenure and
other faculty privileges: When I
accepted my first post as Lecturer
at the University of London, I was
told by my colleagues that the only
way I could be fired was by
committing an unnatural act with
the Chancellor on Visitors Day
before the Queen Mother. The case
can be argued, I think, but either
way it is a far cry from the
antiseptic morality which
threatens a man's position (or his
pay) for heckling in an open
meeting.
