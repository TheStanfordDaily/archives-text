## The
						Law School & Ehrlich

Amid the flurry of frenzied
indignation over the incident last
Monday at which millionaire
aristocrat Henry Cabot Lodge was
inconvenienced and "flustered,"
(according to the Chronicle) the
ruling clique of the University
sneaked one over the students at
this bastion of freedom. Tom
Ehrlich, "quiet, scholarly"
professor of law became the new
deam of the Law School. Ehrlich
is the kind of man the Trustees
(the white knights of Hewlitt
Packard, Wells Fargo, Utah
Construction and Mining, etc.)
can trust.
Whether people realize it or
not, Stanford Law School has
long been the breeding grounds
for many of the legal technicians
of the ruling class of this Empire.
Local firms, such as McCutchen,
Doyle, Brown and Emerson
(clients: Hewlitt Packard,
Stanford); Lillick, McHose,
Adams and Charles (Dillinghan,
Lockheed); Brubeck, Phleger and
Harrison (Wells Fargo, C and H
Sugar, Fibreboard Paper
Products); Heller, Ehrman, White
and McAuliffe (Wells Fargo,
Ampex, U.S. Rubber); Pillsbury,
Madison and Sutro (De! Monte,
FMC); Bronson, Bronson and
McKinnon (Bank of America,
Council of California Growers);
Orrick, Dahlquist, Herrington and
Sutcliffe (Del Monte, Safeway
Stores, Crown-Zellerbach,
Transamerica Corp.); and others,
recruit hungrily at the Law
School. That many of their clients
listed above are among the most
ravenous war profiteers and
exploiters of domestic and foreign
labor around is a most common
knowledge. But the community of
interests does not stop at mere
lawyer-client relationships. Many
of the big law firms see to it that
at least one of their partners is on
the board of directors of their
biggest clients. (Thelan etc., is
represented on Bechtel, Pillsbury
etc. on Del Monte, Brobeck etc.
on Wells Fargo, McCutchen etc.,
Brobeck etc., Heller etc. on
Stanford University and the list
goes on). This guarantees a
permanence of the relationship
and of course largely determines
the entire policy of the firm.
This cozy little picture fits in
quite well with the selection of
Mr. Ehrlich as Dean. A former
corporate lawyer and State
Department advisor (to the
Assistant Secretary of State), his
specialty is, curiously enough,
International Law. It is no
accident that in the last year the
number of courses at the Law
School in international business
transactions has grown and
numerous "foreign" speakers have
appeared to promote American
presence abroad. The Bay Area
has rapidly become, in recent
years, the jumping-off point for
imperialist adventures overseas
and for war research. The Law
School apparently is keeping up
with the times.
Mr. Ehrlich, incidently, is not
merely a passive rooter of
imperialism. Last spring he acted

as a "legal observer" but was in
fact a snitch. He could frequently
be seen accompanying
ex-President Pitzer around the
campus and was responsible for
turning students' names over to
the "authorities."
Enough about Ehrlich. It
should be understood by now that
Stanford University is not a forum
for the free exchange of ideas. It
is directly involved in the

imperialist activities of the most
reactionary forces of society. It
tolerates only that which does not
endanger its interests. It calls this
free speech. When a pig like Lodge
gets shouted down the only
negative reaction on the part of
most of us should be that more
couldn't have been done to smash
the monster—lmperialism—for
good. (Peter Goldscheider belongs
