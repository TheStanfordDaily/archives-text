# Pitzer Requests Public Support, Supervision Of Scientific Research
## 
### DAVE STEVENS 
Former Stanford President Kenneth
S. Pitzer called for a new "coherent and
generally accepted rationale for public
support of science" in the third lecture
of the Chemistry Department's
"Relevance of Chemistry" series given
here last night.
Pitzer deplored what he called the
"tendency of Congress to acquiesce to
the President and his staff on matters of
technical complexity." He remarked
that major re-organization in
Congressional decision-making
processes—notably committee structure
and seniority systems—are needed to
restore the Congress' "traditional role."
Reorganization, Pitzer noted, would
be a check to what he termed the
"tunnel vision of executive decisions."
A former university president, both
here and at Rice, Pitzer is also a leading
chemist and past Director of Research of
the Atomic Energy Commission. He
recalled that in the twenty years
following the end of World War 11,
science had enjoyed an unparalleled
"honeymoon period" in the United
States—"a period of wide and
unquestioned financial support."
Scientific Bases
Pitzer named the scientific bases of
the 1 945 victory, Cold War pressures
"symbolized by one word: Sputnik,"

and the mass popularity of medical
advances as reasons for this general
public support, and hailed advances in
both basic and applied research in this
period, culminating in the Apollo
missions and medical breakthroughs as
the most important successes—proofs
that "these expenditures were
productive."
Since 1 9 64 , however, science's role in
American society has been widely
questioned by critics from camps as
removed from one another as the New
Left—"which so far as I can tell seeks the
elimination of most of science" and the
Congress, which has examined the
economic, military and cultural aspects
of science's role in our society.
This questioning, said Pitzer, was
necessary: I believe—among many
others—that we do need to review the
role of science in our society.
Major Characteristics
Pitzer named four major
characteristics of science which should
be considered in this public
reassessment.
First, he said, without neglecting the
important cultural effects of science on
society, it is primarily practical
advancements that merit and will
continue to receive public financial
support.

Secondly, he called for a balanced
view of the distinctions between basic
and applied research: "We should
remind those purists who show disdain
for applications that it is the useful
aspect that justifies most financial
support, while at the same time
reminding those who would press all
research work toward immediate
practical problems that they would
thereby kill a goose laying many golden
eggs."
Thirdly, he called for "improved
methods of human decision-making" to
lessen the role of laissez-faire in scientific
research and development, and
specifically, "in anticipating possible
environmental effects of new
discoveries."
Re-evaluation
Finally, he called for a re-cvaluation
in the amount of support scientific
research should receive, and the number
scientists needed to carry it out.
Pitzer concluded by remarking that
should "a realistic and effective
adjustment" be made by scientists to the
needs of our changing society, "public
confidence and support will be
regenerated. Such renewed confidence is
not assured; it must be earned by flexible
and responsible action related to the
needs and desires of mankind."

of the Chemistry Department's
"Relevance of Chemistry" series given
here last night.
Pitzer deplored what he called the
"tendency of Congress to acquiesce to
the President and his staff on matters of
technical complexity." He remarked
that major re-organization in
Congressional decision-making
processes—notably committee structure
and seniority systems—are needed to
restore the Congress' "traditional role."
Reorganization, Pitzer noted, would
be a check to what he termed the
"tunnel vision of executive decisions."
A former university president, both
here and at Rice, Pitzer is also a leading
chemist and past Director of Research of
the Atomic Energy Commission. He
recalled that in the twenty years
following the end of World War 11,
science had enjoyed an unparalleled
"honeymoon period" in the United
States—"a period of wide and
unquestioned financial support."
Scientific Bases
Pitzer named the scientific bases of
the 1 945 victory, Cold War pressures
"symbolized by one word: Sputnik,"

and the mass popularity of medical
advances as reasons for this general
public support, and hailed advances in
both basic and applied research in this
period, culminating in the Apollo
missions and medical breakthroughs as
the most important successes—proofs
that "these expenditures were
productive."
Since 1 9 64 , however, science's role in
American society has been widely
questioned by critics from camps as
removed from one another as the New
Left—"which so far as I can tell seeks the
elimination of most of science" and the
Congress, which has examined the
economic, military and cultural aspects
of science's role in our society.
This questioning, said Pitzer, was
necessary: I believe—among many
others—that we do need to review the
role of science in our society.
Major Characteristics
Pitzer named four major
characteristics of science which should
be considered in this public
reassessment.
First, he said, without neglecting the
important cultural effects of science on
society, it is primarily practical
advancements that merit and will
continue to receive public financial
support.

Secondly, he called for a balanced
view of the distinctions between basic
and applied research: "We should
remind those purists who show disdain
for applications that it is the useful
aspect that justifies most financial
support, while at the same time
reminding those who would press all
research work toward immediate
practical problems that they would
thereby kill a goose laying many golden
eggs."
Thirdly, he called for "improved
methods of human decision-making" to
lessen the role of laissez-faire in scientific
research and development, and
specifically, "in anticipating possible
environmental effects of new
discoveries."
Re-evaluation
Finally, he called for a re-cvaluation
in the amount of support scientific
research should receive, and the number
scientists needed to carry it out.
Pitzer concluded by remarking that
should "a realistic and effective
adjustment" be made by scientists to the
needs of our changing society, "public
confidence and support will be
regenerated. Such renewed confidence is
not assured; it must be earned by flexible
and responsible action related to the
needs and desires of mankind."
