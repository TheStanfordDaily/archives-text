# Franklin Answers Charge: 'I Wish I Had Done More'
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
In a firey afternoon press conference
attended by a crowd of 45 0, Professor
H. Bruce Franklin yesterday responded
to charges brought against him in
connection with the disruption of a
speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge.
"The appropriate response to war
criminals is not heckling," he said, "but
what was done to them at Nuremberg:
they should be locked up or executed."
Standing directly in front of the
President's office in the Inner Quad,
Franklin addressed himself to several
diverse topics during the 20 minute
speech.
Lyman Violation
He charged President Richard
Lyman with "violating the very letter
and spirit of the judicial apparatus" and
asked for a hearing not before the
Advisory Board as recommended by

Lyman, but before, "the oppressed
peoples of the world."
However in a letter to Lyman he
admitted that he could not expect that,
and demanded a hearing before the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
Dressed casually, wearing a red
Venceremos button, Franklin declared,
"the issue here is not me—the issue here
is the peoples of Southeast Asia."
Franklin's talk was preceded by a
noon rally in White Plaza where radical
speakers including Chris Katzenbach,
Theresa Ramirez, Geri Foote, and Janet
Weiss urged support for Franklin.
Foote accused the administration of
"trying to consolidate this University
into a fascist University ... we want it
to be a place where we can get
revolutionary ideas."
In the letter addressed to Lyman,
which Franklin passed out at the rally,
he said, "I demand as public a hearing
and as close a semblance to a fair trail
as I can get." It then quoted a
University pamphlet published in
September as stating, "in no uncertain
terms that faculty violations of the
police on campus disruption are to be
heard by the Stanford Judicial Council,
and 'the rules of procedure would be
identical to those proposed for student
violators.' "
Venceremos Banner
Framed against a bright red
venceremos banner, Franklin further
said that what he is charged with is
merely a violation of a disruption
policy, and "to maintain that a simple
violation of this policy constitutes
'personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's performance
of his appropriate functions within the
University community' robs the
existing legislative acts of any meaning
and is also patently ridiculous."
President Lyman, in a press
conference Tuesday, explained why he
felt Franklin should be heard before

the Advisory Board, and not the JSC.
"The role of the judicial council in
relation to faculty members is very far
from clear," he said.
Explanation
He went on to explain that the
Faculty Senate had tried unsuccessfully
to place faculty under SJC jurisdiction,
and then had established interim panels
instead. The panels, however, according
to Lyman "were set up quite explicitly
to deal with questions which clearly did
not come within the review of an
established tribunal or paragraph 15 of
the statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure . . . thus the
limit of penalty is clearly set up in
advance."
Continued Lyman, "Now in my
judgement it would be a mistake to
take a case of a faculty member which
seemed prima facie to rest on exactly
the same kinds of grounds as the cases
involving students and to send the cases
of the students to a body which has
unlimited power to punish, unlimited
power to judge the gravity of the
offense and make recommendations, as
is the case of the SJC; and to send a
faculty member's case to a panel which
has a very limited power and which
cannot judge whether the offense is
sufficiently serious to involve either
any degree of discriminatory reduction
in salary or dismissal."
Accusation
During his speech, Franklin also
accused the district attorney's office of
preparing to charge the other nine
students and one staff member who
were also involved in the Lodge
incident with criminal acts during the
disruption.
Deputy District Attorney Craig
Brown told the Daily he could not
comment on the case other than to say
that the Sheriff's department had made
an investigation which has been sent to
his office. He did say that he thought it
would be unusual to charge students
through both university and public
legal systems, but he did not rule out
this possibility.
Responding to question from the
press, Franklin said that:
—"I acknowledge that I was in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium when butcher
Lodge was speaking ... I do not deny
making certain demands on Lodge, and
also the two lackies from the Hoover
Institute."
After the press conference Franklin
attempted unsuccessfully to hand
Lyman a copy of his letter. Insteal he
was told to give a copy to Bob Beyers,
director of University News Service,
and it would be forwarded to the
president.
