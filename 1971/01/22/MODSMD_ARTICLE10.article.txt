# 'Song' Fiery, Powerful
## 
### STU ALLEN 
There are no easy answers
tonight in the Little Theater. And
very little carefree laugnter.
"Marching Song" is a successful
production of a powerful play.
John Whiting, the author, created
a group of believable characters
and then placed them in a
situation calculated to baffle the
audience. One leaves the theater
confused, but wiser for the two
and one-half hours spent inside.
The director Michael Barry has
put together a near-professional
production. The acting breathes
fire into Whiting's writing. Only
occasionally is the audience let
down by an apparently forced
gesture, word, or action. The
excellent set, designed by K.
Clarke Crandell, is an imaginative
pattern of circles, cylinders and

di&s that focus attention in the
middle, framing the action.
The star on opening night was
Catherine de Troyes, played by
Carlisle Ellis. Catherine has great
faith in love, faith for tomorrow.
Faced by the heartbreaking
realities in store for that
tomorrow, however, she despairs.
The viewer admires her courage
and faith, yet condemns her for
her neglect of the obvious
happiness that is always lurking
around in life.
This sort of contradiction
pervades the play and illustrates
what the program notes call "the
contemporary human dilemma."
Steven Levin gave a convincing
portrayal of Harry Lancaster, who
cannot face today and doesn't
have too much of a yesterday to
lean back on. Yet there is always

some wry remark bouncing out of
his head, just enough to suggest
that he doesn't take himself
seriously, and doesn't want
anyone else to either.
Deborah Pauly, as Dido, who
may have an answer; Steve Weber,
as John Cadmus, an aptly named
chap; and Bruce Pribram, as
Rupert Foster, who never knew if
he could love or not, were also
very good and frequently very
exciting.
The West Coast premiere will
be at the Little Theater at 8 p.m.
this weekend and next Wednesday
through Saturday, January 27 -30,
with a matinee tomorrow at two
p.m.
One wonders where and why
such a good, albeit disturbing,
play was hidden away. Now it is
out in the open where it can, and
should, be seen.


SHE'S SO HEAVY Carlisle Ellis lays some dramatic histrionics on co-star Bruce Pribram in this scene
from "Marching Song," the latest Stanford Thespian production, now showing at the Little Theater.
