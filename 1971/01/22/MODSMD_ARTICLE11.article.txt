# Russian Classics To Show Tonight
## 
### 
On campus tonight will be one
of the greatest films ever made,
Potemkin, released in 1 925 by the
great Soviet cinematographer
theoretician Sergei Eisenstein.
This film was voted "The Greatest
Film of All" by the 1962 Sight
and Sounds' Poll of World Film
Critics in Brussels. It is an artistic
as well as culturally functional
view of events leading up to the
Soviet Revolution of 1917, and a
precursor of film-making in areas
of revolutionary political and
human activity.
The story is based on a real
incident: a mutiny on the
Battleship Potemkin in 1905,
which led to an unsuccessful
insurrection foreshadowing the
1917 Revolution. As in all his
films, Eisenstein distorts history
for the sake of Soviet propaganda,
but for the sake of art as well. The
great Odessa steps sequence
(perhaps the most famous of all
film sequences) - in which the
army fires on innocent men,
women and children â€” never
actually happened.
And the climax of the first
section of the film is one of the
most beautiful, most moving,
most romantic (and most
unlikely) views of revolution ever
conceived: ordered to shoot down
the mutineers, the men of the
firing squad hesitate; a mutineer
cries out, "Brothers! Wiio are you
shooting at?", and the men lower
their guns and join them.
In so many ways does this film
give one parallels to those
situations confronting us today
until one wonders why Potemkin
doesn't make the college circuit
every academic year.
The film is not just a head-trip.
It does not simply entertain one.
Potemkin confronts us with many
questions of heavy moral weight
and significance. Sergei Eisenstien
himself was perhaps the most
uncompromising of all
film-makers, sparing not the
singlest or the least of details if it
added to the accuracy of the
portrait he was giving us: that
revolutionary vision of the world

by the earliest Soviet
revolutionaries in the first 30
years of the century.
It has been Eisenstein's credit
that he, and precious few others
since him, was able to do research
into such a weighty and politically
consequential tour de force and
not get his audience bogged down
in the often musty hallways and
corridors of history. The film
moves, it provokes, excites, and
arouses one's imagination and
intellectual capacities. It is also,
almost coincidentally, good
film-viewing.
Playing on the same bill with
Potemkin is the little-seen
Pudovkin masterpiece, Mother.
Pudovkin, who along with
Eisenstein came to be recognized
as the leading Communist
cinematographers, is blessed with
a superb revolutionary instinct for
human potential in the most
degrading of social situations.
Mother is little known to many
regular movie-watchers on the
West Coast and most certainly in
the Bay Area.
The films are showing at
Cubberley tonight at 7 andlo,sl
admission.


THE FOOL.
