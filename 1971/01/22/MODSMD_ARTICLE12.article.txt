# Stanford Hockey
## Bumps And Bruises 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
There is logically something
dangerous about skating at speeds
of up to 30 mph when there are
five guys on the ice waiting to,
shall we say, slow you down. If
you're unbelieving, next time you
see a hockey player, count his
teeth.
He'll probably be missing as
many as he has left. And when he
isn't losing teeth, he's bumping
and bruising the rest of his body.
The players take quite a beating,
but they keep on playing and the
people who watch them love it.
The speed, danger and finesse
combine to make for an exciting
sport.
If you want to see all of this,
you could see the Oakland Seals,
possibly the worst team in the
National Hockey League. But
there's an easier and cheaper way.
Few people know it, but Stanford
has a hockey team.
The Stanford Hockey Club is a
group of undergraduate and
graduate students who participate
in the Bay Area Senior Hockey
League. The six team league is
made up of four teams whose

members are ex-college and pro
players, and Cal and Stanford.
And if you think this is
lightweight, non-dangerous
hockey, you're wrong. I don't
know how the player in the
picture above fared, but he
probably felt less than perfect for
awhile.
In the last game I saw, a player
who severely bruised his hip,
spent ten minutes prone on the
ice and finally left on a stretcher.
One Stanford player has had seven
concussions. You need some kind
of desire to play this game.
Not only do the Stanford
players take this kind of
punishment, they have to pay for
it. Each player has to put out
almost $160 each year. The club
receives $85 0 from the athletic
department and $200 from the
Dean of Students Office, but they
still fall way short.
And this year the players may
have to put out even more money.
After the regular season, the club
is travelling on March 4 to
Boulder, Colorado, for the
Colorado Invitational Hockey

Tournament. The cost of going
back will be around $1600.
But before then, the Indians
still have two more regular season
games and the playoffs. They lost
to Belmont 5-4 on Tuesday night,
but they are still involved in a
battle for first place.
Next Tuesday they play
Berkeley at the Belmont Iceland
and on February 1, they play wSan
Francisco at the Leggs Ice Arena
in San Francisco. The playoffs
will be held on the weekends of
February 1 5 and 22.
Hopefully more fans will make
it out to see these guys, who
admittedly sacrifice both
physically and financially. The
third period of the Belmont game
in which Stanford came back
from a 4-0 defecit to almost win,
was quite exciting, but only a
handful of fans were there to see
it.
The Belmont Iceland is located
at 815 Old Country Road in
Belmont and can be reached by
taking the Ralston Avenue ramp
off the Bay shore Freeway. The
Legg's Ice Arena is located at 4 5
11th Street in the City, near the
Civic Auditorium.

from a 4-0 defecit to almost win,
was quite exciting, but only a
handful of fans were there to see
it.
The Belmont Iceland is located
at 815 Old Country Road in
Belmont and can be reached by
taking the Ralston Avenue ramp
off the Bay shore Freeway. The
Legg's Ice Arena is located at 4 5
11th Street in the City, near the
Civic Auditorium.

There is logically something
dangerous about skating at speeds
of up to 30 mph when there are
five guys on the ice waiting to,
shall we say, slow you down. If
you're unbelieving, next time you
see a hockey player, count his
teeth.
He'll probably be missing as
many as he has left. And when he
isn't losing teeth, he's bumping
and bruising the rest of his body.
The players take quite a beating,
but they keep on playing and the
people who watch them love it.
The speed, danger and finesse
combine to make for an exciting
sport.
If you want to see all of this,
you could see the Oakland Seals,
possibly the worst team in the
National Hockey League. But
there's an easier and cheaper way.
Few people know it, but Stanford
has a hockey team.
The Stanford Hockey Club is a
group of undergraduate and
graduate students who participate
in the Bay Area Senior Hockey
League. The six team league is
made up of four teams whose

members are ex-college and pro
players, and Cal and Stanford.
And if you think this is
lightweight, non-dangerous
hockey, you're wrong. I don't
know how the player in the
picture above fared, but he
probably felt less than perfect for
awhile.
In the last game I saw, a player
who severely bruised his hip,
spent ten minutes prone on the
ice and finally left on a stretcher.
One Stanford player has had seven
concussions. You need some kind
of desire to play this game.
Not only do the Stanford
players take this kind of
punishment, they have to pay for
it. Each player has to put out
almost $160 each year. The club
receives $85 0 from the athletic
department and $200 from the
Dean of Students Office, but they
still fall way short.
And this year the players may
have to put out even more money.
After the regular season, the club
is travelling on March 4 to
Boulder, Colorado, for the
Colorado Invitational Hockey

Tournament. The cost of going
back will be around $1600.
But before then, the Indians
still have two more regular season
games and the playoffs. They lost
to Belmont 5-4 on Tuesday night,
but they are still involved in a
battle for first place.
Next Tuesday they play
Berkeley at the Belmont Iceland
and on February 1, they play wSan
Francisco at the Leggs Ice Arena
in San Francisco. The playoffs
will be held on the weekends of
February 1 5 and 22.
Hopefully more fans will make
it out to see these guys, who
admittedly sacrifice both
physically and financially. The
third period of the Belmont game
in which Stanford came back
from a 4-0 defecit to almost win,
was quite exciting, but only a
handful of fans were there to see
it.
