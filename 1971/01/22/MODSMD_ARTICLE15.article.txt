# Weekend
## 
### 
play some this weekend.
Rosenzweig has just about
recovered from knee surgery he
underwent in November, but a
pulled groin muscle he suffered in
practice Wednesday may delay his
season's debut another week.
Leading the Redskins will be
All-American guard candidate
Mike Newlin. Newlin leads the
team in scoring with an 19.8
season's average. Last year in a
96-94 win over Stanford, Newlin
scored 3 3.
But the 33 points must be
considered perspective since 23 of
them were free throws. In fact
Utah made 4 4 out of 52 free
throws. This wasn't the first time
a visiting team has scored 15 more
field goals than the Utes and lost,
but fortunately their referees
won't be coming out for the
game.
In a 6:00 preliminary game,
the undefeated Stanford
Freshmen will face the University
of California-Davis JR's. 6-6
forward Steve Shupe, who scored
34 points and pulled down 2 3
rebounds in two games last
weekend, will be out of action
with a sprained ankle. 6-6 forward
Dan Broderiek will take Shupe's
place in the starting lineup.
