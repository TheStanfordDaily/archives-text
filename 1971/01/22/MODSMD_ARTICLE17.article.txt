# Report to the Student Body on the ASSU
## 
### 
All too often students and other
members of the University community
have been unaware of the activities of the
ASSU. The beginning of the new year
seemed an appropriate time to review
what has been successively accomplished,
what mistakes have been made, and what
remains yet to be done.
I. GOVERNANCE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
The role of students in the governance
of the university has been one of
continuing concern, especially in the last
few years. A short review of
developments during the last few years is
necessary to an understanding of where
we are now and what needs to be done.
The governing structure of Stanford has
been gradually evolving to give students
some share of decision making authority.
The original impetus for this change began
in 1967 with the creation of the Study of
Education at Stanford (SES), a major and
almost unique reviefo of all aspects of the
school by joint groups of students,
faculty, and staff. Ten reports were
ultimately published with
recommendations for change. In 1968 the
faculty responded to the need for a
representative deliberative body to study
and implement the SES reports by
creating the Academic Senate. One year
later the ASSU responded by proposing
the reform of its own constitution to
eliminate the old 120 member Legislature
(LASSU) and to create the present 40
member Senate. Like the Academic
Senate the Student Senate was expected
to deal with SES recommendations. While
the new ASSU constitution was being
passed (it took three votes in the Fall,
Winter, and Spring quarters) an interim
student group was created, the 40
member Student Education Council
(SEC). During the spring of 1969 this
group worked with the faculty and
achieved the elimination of the history
and language requirements. It disappeared
with the approval of the new Student
Senate.
One important area of change in
governance accelerated by SES was
student representation on committees of
the University. From a time when
virtually no student was represented on
governing committees, Stanford has now
placed students on almost every
important committee in the School. The
Board of Trustees has also expanded its
membership to include student members
on the Board committees and two elected
trustees in the under thirty-five age
group.
A second major area of change
concerned the disciplinary system at
Stanford. The Committee of Fifteen
(C-15) was originally created as a
discussion group for the exchange of
views among the three major
constituencies of the school. In 1968 as
the only multi-constituent body on
campus, it was given the responsibility for
creating a student judicial system at
Stanford. Two new bodies were formed,
the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) and the Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC). The SCLC establishes guidelines of
appropriate and punishable beh .vior and
the SJC acts as a court to hear charges of
infractions of the SCLC regulations.
With the task of forming these bodies
completed, however, the role of the C-15
seemed unclear. Partly to eliminate this
lack of responsibility, the C-15 wrote
itself into the charters of the SJC and
SCLC as the body which would consider
any changes to their charters. Last year
attempts to use the C-15 hearings as a
vehicle for reducing tensions on campus
took the committee beyond its charter
and, for a number of reasons, created
distrust and dissatisfaction among some
of its members.
Recognizing the need for a group
representing the various constituencies of
the University and the limited charter of
the C-15, another group, the University
Advisory Committee, was formed in
1969. It was hoped that the committee
would serve as a means of developing
communications between the students,
faculty administration, and trustees. This
particular structure proved ineffectual. Its
functions were largely supplanted by
student membership on Trustee
committees and it was disbanded this last
summer.
The record for the last few years
includes a number of important and
significant changes. It might be argued
that now is a time for rest to let some of
these newly created institutions settle.
However, there is one problem of
university governance that has persisted
throughout these years of change and has
really never been satisfactorily resolved.
Consistently, there has been recognition
of the need for some joint body,
representing at least students and faculty
and often staff, that could deal with
University problems that concerned more
than a single constituency of the school.
The original SES effort recognized this
need when it placed students on all of its
committees. The C-15 was originally
created to serve something of this
purpose, but the problems and
controversies surrounding it now limit its
effectiveness in this area. The SEC and
University Advisory Committee were two
more attempts which for a variety of
reasons failed to fill the need.
Last spring while reviewing the way
decisions were made on the ROTC issue,
the role of the Student Senate and
student referendums in â€¢ these
deliberations, and the failure of the

Student Senate to deal at all with the
remaining SES recommendations,
members of both the old and new
Council of Presidents came to the
conclusion that there still remained an
unfilled need in the governing structure
of Stanford. If reasoned and
representative discussion is to occur
among the major constituent groups of
the University on matters of campus wide
concern, a deliberative body that
represents all constituent groups must be
formally established.
The existing institutions simply do not
operate well in this area. The Academic
and Student Senates have never met
together and resolve their deliberations
separately and with little thought for
each other. Student committee
representatives often work in a vacuum of
little or no knowledge of whether their
views coincide with or reflect those of
their constituency. Attempts to remedy
this situation are hampered by the sheer
number of committees involved. The
University Advisory Committee is gone
and the C-15 is likely to be limited in its
deliberations to the single issue of
reforms of the Judicial Charter. There is
at present no mechanism through which
faculty, students, and staff can come
together to initiate, study, debate, or
review issues of common concern.
During the Fall the Council has been
working with a special staff committee
and a class in the law school to develop a
proposal to remedy this situation. There
are a number of models at other schools
and universities and we have examined
many of these in our attempt to create a
new one which meets the unique
situation of Stanford. We have called this
proposal the University Assembly. The
proposal is now in the drafting stage and
will soon be brought to the student body
for consideration. If approved, it will
then go to the faculty and administration.
This is not a proposal to be accepted
without thorough review and we hope
that all concerned will examine the
proposal closely and suggest
improvements. The University Assembly
could be a culmination of years of
change, the fulfillment of a need that has
never been met.
11. ACADEMIC REFORM
Academic reform has followed closely
the history of the governance of the
University. As was mentioned above the
SES Reports initiated a remarkable
review of academic affairs throughout the
school. Among students the SEC was
specifically created to deal with these
proposals, but ended its efforts with the
expectation that the new Student Senate
would deal with them. The failure of the
Senate last year to assume its
responsibility in this area left the burden
with the Council of Presidents. It was
through the efforts of John Grube and
Joyce Kobayashi and many others that
any educational innovation was achieved.
The SWOPSI program and the creation of
Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education represented a
practical fulfillment of the "Experimental
College" that had been discussed for
years. Students can now mold and create
courses to fit their own special needs and
concerns.
During the same time the Council
began efforts to create programs of
course review and teacher evaluation. The
first systematic attempts were made to
objectively and thoroughly review from a
student view point the requirements,
character and quality of courses offered.
Also attempted were the first student
evaluations of the teaching effectiveness
of faculty. This latter step is vital if
teaching is ever to be of the same
magnitude of concern to faculty as
research.
Whether the University Assembly is
created or not, academic reform must
remain one of the foremost concerns of
the Student Senate. To assure that this
occurs the Council of Presidents has
recommended to the Senate the creation
of a Standing Committee for Academic
Affairs. There are at present three
standing committees of the
Senate-Rules, By-Laws and Finance.
Academic Affairs is at least as important
as these. The By-Laws Committee of the
Senate has received this proposal and a
vote may be expected some time in
January.
If this committee is established, there
are some ideas which it could quickly
begin to study: three year degrees, a
twelve-month academic year, a
continuing education program, and a
university exchange program. No one, as
yet, is fully committed to any of these
proposals; yet few in the University have
given them full consideration They
include:
1) Establishing a three or two year
bachelor degree program as a regular
alternative to the present standard four
year program.
2) Making the regular academic year
12 months rather than the present nine
with graduation expected in thirty-six
months.
3) Establishing a continuing education
program for alumni whereby they would
be granted the right to return at any
time for a limited number of course units
during a specified time (e.g., 15 units
during any three-year period).
4) Establishing a major university
exchange program in which students
could transfer to other domestic or
foreign universities with automatic course
credit and guaranteed admission.

All of these ideas are ones which the
Academic Affairs Committee of the
Student Senate could begin studying
now.These are also ideas which are
exactly the type that a University
Assembly should deal with. Reform and
change in academic affairs or elsewhere is
to some extent inextricably bound with
the nature and structure of the governing
mechanisms of the University.
SPIF
Last Fall a representative from the
Department of Health, Education, and
Welfare visited campus to encourage
students to send proposals for
student-initiated projects to his office for
possible funding. His office forwards
proposals to the appropriate government
agency or program which in turn
authorizes appropriations.
To encourage students to come up
with clever ideas for funding and to
create a continuing contact on campus
with H.E.W., the Council has established
the Student Project Initiative Fund
(SPIF). This group will assist students in
making proposals in a form which will
have the greatest chance of success and
which meets University guidelines.
More information will be made
available in a few weeks. In the
meantime, if you have an idea, please
contact R.N. Grant at the ASSU.
111. ADMINISTRATION AND
AGENCIES OF THE ASSU
STUDENT FINANCIAL MANAGER
The student financial manager is a
constitutionally created officer of the
ASSU chosen by a special selection
committee and confirmed by the Senate.
He is responsible for supervising the
expenditure of the various funds which
make up the budget of the ASSU. These
funds include: 1) The money provided by
the University for the operation of the
ASSU Office. 2) The program fee, the
amount of which is approved each Spring
by referendum of the student body. For
1970-71 the fee is $1.00 per student per
quarter. This money is budgeted by the
Senate to various student activities.
3) The special assessments voted by the
student body. This year there are two
such assessments: one dollar per student
per quarter for the Daily and the same
amount for the Special Events Board. 4)
The funds of voluntary student
organizations which are required by the
Constitution to be deposited with the
ASSU.
Last Spring the ASSU finances were
facing a number of problems. The
auditors of the University were unable to
certify the accounts of the ASSU. A
number of organizations had substantial
over expenditures of their accounts. The
notes receivable account, [loans by the
ASSU to student or university groups,]
was unusually large. And reporting and
billing of accounts was delayed due to the
overload of work.
Chuck Peterson, this year's Student
Financial Manager and a graduate student
in the Business School, has made a
number of significant improvements in
the financial status of the Association. A
simplification of the accounting system
and long hours of review of the accounts
with auditors has produced a balance
sheet reviewed by the internal University
Auditors and likely to be certified by the
official auditors, Lybrand, Ross and
Montgomery. Balance sheets for August,
Sept., Oct., and Nov. are now
available to any interested student and
December's is published below.
Overdrafts in student organization
accounts have been substantially reduced
or are now in negotiation for planned
repayment! And the backlog of work is
now being overcome.
Chuck has proposed one change in the
operations of the office which will
require a Constitutional Amendment. All
voluntary student groups are required to
bank with the ASSU. The only reason
that has been found for this requirement
is to insure that money raised for
activities by using tax-exempt University
facilities, such as Frost Ampitheatre, are
spent only by campus organizations and
not donated to non-University groups.
One major disadvantage to the ASSU of
the requirement is the cost of trying to
keep track of these accounts. In addition,
the ASSU does not have the power or the
specific responsibility to enforce
University regulations. The Committee on
Public Events has agreed that
responsibility for enforcement of this
regulation belongs with the University,
not the ASSU.
The Constitutional Amendment Chuck
has proposed will limit the requirement
that voluntary student organizations must
bank with the ASSU to those
organizations which receive funds from
the ASSU program budget. Other
organizations may use the services of the
ASSU if they so choose. The amendment
will be brought to a vote of the student
body either Winter or Spring Quarter.

The Student Financial Manager is also
responsible for the operation of several
other non-profit agencies of the ASSU.
These include the Boathouse, the Travel
Service, the Typesetting Shop, and the
Sunday Flicks.
BOATHOUSE: An engineering firm hired to
review the safety of the Boathouse has
declared it structurally unsafe. Since the
cost of repair would in the long run
exceed the cost of a new Boathouse, the
ASSU is cor.sidering using it for the next
Bonfire. At the present time we do not
have the funds to build a new Boathouse,
but are soliciting ideas for the financing
and design of a new facility. The head
lifeguard, Burt Mason, is doing most of
the work in this area. Burt also needs
some ideas on what to do for this Spring.
The lake can be used, the boathouse
cannot.
TRAVEL SERVICE: The Travel Service,
managed by Gorton De Mond, is a
non-profit agency which arranges
chartered flights to Honolulu,
Amsterdam, New York, Tahiti, and
Tokyo at special student rates. Further
information is available at the Travel
Service office on the second floor of
Tresidder in the ASSU offices.
TYPESETTING SHOP: The ASSU also
manages the Typesetting Shop whose
major customers are the publications of
the ASSU. Beverly Hendricks manages
the shop. Any student organization which
has a project that requires typesetting of
any special type, size, or style that cannot
be done on a regular typewriter may
contact Beverly for assistance.
SUNDAY FLICKS: Sunday Flicks is a
non-profit ASSU enterprise designed to
provide the best movies available at cost.
The Flicks have been making a profit so
far this year at the 50c admission price
and so the price will be lowered to 40c in
the near future. We hope this will set a
trend for the other film organizations.
DUPLICATING CENTER, continuing drain
on ASSU funds last year was caused by
the open availability of the duplicating
equipment. Paper and supplies were used
without payment, and the cost of
repairing damaged equipment amounted
to $200.00 per month. Borut Dekleva is
now responsible for the ASSU
Duplicating Center. The Center operates
on a cost basis, charging only to cover
materials, labor, and overhead. It is open
9 to 4 daily and available to anyone. The
Xerox prices of four cents for the first 10
copies and three cents thereafter are the
lowest on the campus. As volume
increases prices may be lowered even
further.
OFFICE ARRANGEMENTS:The Presidentof
the Association with the assistance of the
Student Financial Manager is responsible
for the office and facilities of the ASSU.
This summer a number of rearrangements
were made by Assistant Student Financial
Manager, Jan Westfall, to promote greater
and easier usage by students. The old
liquor cabinets of the faculty club have
been purchased and are now available as
locked storage for any student group.
Work tables, stools, and desks have been
purchased for use by any groups. And the
"Bullpen" area is open for meetings at
any time.
Nominations Comittee
The Nominations Committee is a
constitutionally created group which is,
subject to the confirmation of
responsible for the appointment of
student representatives to all major
committees of the University. Its six
members are selected by the Senate, three
each in January and April.
A list of the various committees on
which students serve and when
applications were due was made available
by Hal Mickelson of the Council of
Presidents last Fall. Additional copies are
available at the ASSU. The Nominations
Committee has been interviewing
candidates since November and expects
to complete its appointments for 1970-71
by the third week in January.
This is only the second year of
operation for the Nominations
Committee and a number of unresolved
issues have been raised since last June.
First, student representatives end their
term in June of the Academic Year of
their appointment. Since it normally
takes some weeks for appointments to be
made and confirmed by the Senate, there
is effectively no student representation
on University Committees during the
Summer and Fall Quarters.
Second, no provisions have been made
for the appointment of student
representatives in the absence of a Senate
and/or a Nominations Committee. This is
especially obvious when replacements are
needed for students who are no longer
available to serve and when appointments
to newly created committees are needed.
These two problems were temporarily
resolved this year by the practical
solutions of asking students to continue
to serve until replaced and by appointing

interim representatives until "the Senate
and Nominations Committee could
convene.
A third problem which has arisen
involves the responsibility for
appointment of students to gray area
commiltees such as study groups or
search committees of a school. The
President of the University has been
exercising this authority in the absence of
any student government policy to the
contrary.
The Council of Presidents has
proposed a series of By-Law provisions
which will permanently resolve these
three problems. First, the Nominations
Committee will have full responsibility
for the appointment of any student to
any committee of the University. Minor
committee appointments may be
returned to the appropriate student
officers of a program, department,
division or school, or in their absence to
the President of the Association. Second,
these appointments must be completed
by the end of Spring Quarter of the
Academic Year preceding the one in
which they will serve, thus assuring
student representation for the Fall term.
Third, students will serve until replaced
by new appointees from the Nominations
Committee. And fourth, in the absence of
a Senate and Nominations Committee,
the President of the Association may
appoint interim student representatives to
serve until regular representatives are
selected by the regular processes.
These proposals are now being studied
by the By-Laws Committee of the
Student Senate and will probably be
acted upon sometime in January.
Elections Commissioner
The Elections Commissioner is a
position created by the By-Laws of the
Association. The Commissioner is
appointed by the Senate and is
responsible for conducting all ASSU
elections.
This Fall the election of a Student
Senate was delayed by several weeks. The
Council of Presidents investigated the
events and reported the results of their
review in the Daily. Two errors, the
failure to proofread the ballot properly
and incorrect metering of overseas ballot
mailings, caused the delay in the election.
Other charges reported in the Daily or
elsewhere simply were not supported by
the facts.
The Council of President's
investigation indicated several areas where
the Elections Commission should be
strengthened and, therefore, have
prepared a number of By-Law revisions
for consideration by the Senate. Two new
salaried positions of Assistant Elections
Commissioners should be created to assist
the Commissioner in the same manner
that the two Assistant Student Financial
Managers assist the Student Financial
Manager. Second, in the absence of a
Senate the Vice-President of the
Association is granted authority to
remove the Commissioner for cause and
appoint a new Commissioner or assume
the responsibilities himself. Third, an
appeal board composed of the President
and Vice-President of the Association and
the Elections Commissioner will be
created to hear charges of violations of
electioneering rules with the authority to
nullify, cancel, or re-schedule elections.
These proposals are now being studied
by the By-Laws Committee of the Senate
and should be acted upon in January.
Special Events Board
Established under the By-Laws of the
Association in the Spring of 1968, the
Special Events Board is responsible for
the publication of the Quarterly Calendar
and for the presentation of a yearly series
of concerts, films, and lectures for the
University community. The Chairman of
Special Events is appointed in the Spring
of the year by a special selection
committee and confirmed by the Senate.
The current Chairman is Adam Levin of
the Council of Presidents.
CONCERTS:!n last Spring's elections the
student body approved a referendum
providing for a special assessment of
$1.00 per student for four quarters to
finance Special Events. Proposed by
Adam Levin and Bennett Cullum, this
assessment created a revolving fund of
$40,000 from which to draw monies for
the presentation of entertainment.
In the production of concerts
significant sums of money, often
exceeding $15,000, are required to cover
the artists' fees and the costs of
promotion. Previously, the small amount
appropriated by the Senate for this
program ($3,600 in 68 69 and $2,940 in
69-70) prevented Special Events from
bringing nationally known performers to
campus. With the revolving fund Special
Events is now able to cover the costs for
practically any well-known act.
The admission prices for all events are
set to break even or to make a small
profit. Prices are reduced for Stanford
students to allow them to regain the
