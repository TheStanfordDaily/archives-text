### 
$1.00 fee assessment through savings on
the tickets. The revenue generated by
each concert returns to the revolving fund
to be utilized in the next event. The
current goal is to maintain the fund at
least at its current level so that it may be
available in future years without the need
to assess students further for this
program.
The results to date of the Special
Events productions are well-known to
most of you. On October 9, Sly & the
Family Stone appeared before an
overflow crowd of over 11,000 at Frost
Amphitheater. Because of the higher than
normal security and maintenance repair
costs, the concert lost about $500. On
December 3, the Moody Blues and Elvin
Bishop played before a sell-out audience
in Roscoe Maples Pavilion. The estimated
profits of this event (when all the
outstanding bills are paid) will be
between $3,000 and $4,000. The major
responsibility for the production of both
successes rested with Vice-Chairman,
Mark Randolph, who heads up the
concert division of Special Events. Mark,
Adam, and Loudin Beam are in the
process of lining up the future events
which will be announced during the next
few weeks.
FILMS: The film division of Special
Events, under the direction of its former
Vice-Chairman Cynthia Weber, had a
successful run during the Fall Quarter. A
James Dean film series, the Magic Lantern
collection of films, and the Monster
Flicks appeared in October and
November. This quarter, Fred Estevez has
assumed responsibility for films and will
be announcing his program quite soon.
LECTURES: The Lecture Division under
Vice-Chairman Channing Johnson
brought three featured speakers to
campus this Fall: Danilo Dolci (presented
in association with Public Events), Mervin
Field (presented in association with
Stanford Community Forum '70), and
Mrs. W.E.B. Du√üois.
CALENDER: Vice-Chairman Sara Gibson
compiles and publishes the Quarterly
Calendar. Because of the early deadline
for this quarter's publication, the Board
will publish another calendar in late
January to include those groups who
could not be included in the first edition.
It will be part of the announcement of
the special events for the remainder of
the year.
REVOLVING FUND FINANCING: ' The
Revolving Fund of Special Events is also
available for the financing of
student-initiated programs. Any student
or campus group with a profit-making
proposal may apply to the Special Events
Board for financing. If the idea, plans,
and projections are approved by the
Chairman and the Student Financial
Manager, the revolving fund will finance
the project from the revolving fund. If
the program is profitable, the financing is
repaid along with 5% of the gross
receipts; if the program is not profitable,
the fund absorbs the loss. If you have an
idea, contact Adam Levin for details on
financing from the fund.
Political Union Board
The Political Union Board is a group
established by the By-Laws of the
Association for the purpose of presenting
"a varied program of education on
political and social issues of local and
national interest." The five members are
selected by a special selection committee.
At the present time no Political Union
Board exists. Last year the chairman of
the Board was criticized in the Senate for
arranging a number of speakers without
the approval of the full board, expending
the full year's appropriation for speakers
in one quarter, and failing to obtain the
Student Financial Manager's approval
before signing contracts. The dispute led
to the elimination of funds for the
Political Union Board from the program
budget. Without funds the Board could
not operate and so no new members were
selected last Spring.
This year the Student Committee for
Involvement in Politics (SCIP), the
Political Resources Committee, and the
Office of Public Events filled in for the
Political Union Board by presenting a
series of political speakers in the Stanford
Community Forum '70 Series and
arranging for the SCIP house for partisan
student campaign groups.
If student involvement in the political
process is to be encouraged and
supported in the 1972 elections, the
Political Union Board should be revived.
Not only could it act as a means for
bringing major political speakers to
campus, but, now that the 18 year old
vote has been approved for federal
elections, it could act as a stimulant to
registration of student voters.
The Council of Presidents has
requested that the Senate form the
selection committee for a new Political
Union Board. These people will probably
be selected sometime in January and will
have to immediately begin formulation of
plans and budget proposals for 1971 72.
If any student is interested in serving on
this group, please watch the Daily for
announcements by the Selection
Committee about application procedures.

Publications Board

The Publications Board, established in
the By-Laws, is responsible for "general
control" of all student publications.
Immediate financial and editorial control
of each publication remains with the
individual organization. The Chairman of
the Board oversees the use of
publications' funds, the use and
maintenance of Storke Publications
Building, and the enforcement of ASSU
ByLaws as to publications. The
Chairman for this year is Margie Wolf.
The "Pub" Board has dealt with two
problems this Fall, both involving the
financial difficulties of the various
publications. First, the reserve funds of
the Board accumulated from the profits
from prior years were appropriated
among the various publications to keep
them going. The Daily received $7,273,
the Quad $2,774, the Chaparral $1,043,
and the Sequoia $500.
The second issue brought before the
Board is the investigation of an
independent status for the Daily. The
Board concluded that it had no authority
over this matter and responsibility for it
was assumed by the Daily Editorial Board
as provided in the By-Laws.
A business school student, Miles
Schlosberg, was retained by the Dean of
Students Office to study the implications
of going independent, the risks, and the
means of successfully establishing an
independent status. His report should be
available soon.
It seems likely, however, that any
form of independent status will require
the payment of subscriptions by
purchasers. An unresolved question is
whether the ASSU can purchase a block
subscription from the Daily and yet
remain immune from suits against the
paper for defammation.
The Dean of Students Office has also
completed a review of the arrangements
papers at other schools have established.
A Student Center course has also been
established to study the problem. The
Schlosberg report, the Dean of Students
review, and the results of the Student
Center course will be combined and
studied to make sure the transition is a
smooth and successful one.
Art Board
The Art Board operates from an office
in the ASSU section of Tresidder. Under
the chairmanship of Ann Kortlander, the
Board will make posters, silk screens,
designs, leaflets or any other similar type
of creation at a reasonable price. If you
have something that needs to be done,
check with the ASSU office or with Ann
for further information.
Axe Commission
The "Axe Com" under the
chairmanship of Bob Pringle is
responsible for the Stanford Axe, card
stunts at the- games, and rallies.
Cardinals Board
Cardinals Board is responsible for
special programs and activities of the
ASSU as determined by the Senate and
the President of the Association.
Examples of what they do include the
Childrens Hospital at Stanford Benefit
(Con Home Benefit), Spring Sing, the
Blood Drive, and the building of the
Bonfire. It was through the fine defensive
efforts of this group that the Bonfire was
saved this year from an early burning by a
band of freshman led by their sponsor.
This year's chairman is Bob Thompson.
Divisional Associations
The ASSU Constitution provides for
the formation of divisional student
associations. Any group which forms will
receive one half of the approved program
fee for each student in the divisional
association. Since this year's program fee
is $1.00 per student per quarter, each
association will receive 50c per quarter
for each student in the division. However,
to date only four groups, the Business
School M.B.A.'s, the Business School
Ph.D.'s, the Electrical Engineers, and the
Physics students, have organized and one
group, the History Department, is known
to be in the process of organizing. The
requirements are not onerous. All that is
needed is a petition from a majority of
the students in the division and a
Constitution which provides for the
election of officers by a majority vote
and for open meetings of the Association
once per quarter. The Elections
Commissioner determines whether the
Association has fulfilled these
requirements.
Any program fee money not
distributed to Associations will be
returned to the ASSU underwriting
reserve. If you are interested in forming a
divisional association, please contact the
Elections Commissioner or one of the
Council of Presidents for further
information.
Presidential Staff
The Council of Presidents each year
asks for volunteers to form a Presidential
staff and to take responsibility for special
projects.
mid PENINSULA BOOK: Arlene Camm has
been working through the Fall creating a
Mid Peninsula Book comparable to My
Socrct San Francisco, which will describe

the background, prices and quality of
restaurants and entertainment places in
the surrounding area. When completed
the book will hopefully serve as a guide
to those who wish to find unusual and
interesting places away from campus. If
anyone would like to assist in editing the
final version or adding a clever comment
or two about their favorite place, please
contact R.N. Grant or Pat Shea at the
ASSU.
COOPERATIVE STORE: Barry Schiffman, a
student in the Business School is
preparing a report analyzing the
economic feasibility of a Stanford Co-op
similar to those that exist at Harvard,
Yale, and Princeton. These Co-ops are the
equivalent of moderately sized
department stores and give special
discounts to student shoppers.
Competition from the Stanford Shopping
Center and Palo Alto might make the
proposal economically impossible, but
Barry hopes to determine that issue. If
any one would like to assist him in this
project, please leave a message at the
ASSU.
The possibilities involved in this
undertaking might be indicated by the
Finnish Student Union which owns and
operates student cooperative housing,
health services, and department stores.
BAIL FUND ADMINISTRATION: A bail fund
$5,000 was established by LASSU several
years ago. Loans are made to students at
a reasonable interest rate to facilitate
their payment of bail and release from
jail.
Last spring a number of students were
arrested on campus for a variety of
charges. Many of them, especially the
foreign students, had little or no
understanding of how to obtain legal
assistance or bail.
Under existing arrangements, Santa
Clara County returns the bail payments
to the arrested student, not to the ASSU.
This often resulted in long delay in the
recovery of the bail money by the ASSU.
To alleviate these problems two law
students, Mimi Winslow and Ed Hayes
have agreed to design and organize a bail

fund administration which will 1) make
all students equally aware of their legal
rights and the means available to secure
release on bail; 2) manage the bail fund
by arranging loans and prompt repayment
by the student or the county to the
ASSU. Their report and
recommendations are expected in late
January.
IV. ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS
The ASSU has limited capabilities for
contributing to the resolution of
environmental problems and yet we are
convinced that a large segment of the
student body would like to do something,
if it only knew what.
Our first effort in this area was aimed
at bringing together in a part fair, part
conference, the existing organizations
who have specific tasks and projects and
willing volunteers from among students
and the community by arranging a confer
ence. However, initial efforts to organ
ize this conference met with skeptic
ism from several major environmental
groups who have apparently been "con
ventioned out."
In the scarch for an alternative to the
conference idea we have initiated
inquiries about the possibility of creating
a permanent environmental center and
meeting place on campus. The idea which
seemed most attractive involved building
a geodesic dome on the deck of
Tresidder. The advantages of such a
location are fairly evident: 1) the deck
was originally designed for a second level
structure; 2) it is little used now and yet
in a high traffic area; 3) meeting rooms,
rest rooms and eating facilities are readily
available in TMU; 4) parking is nearby;
and 5) the trellisses and benches offer a
pleasant outdoor area
The problems of such a project are
almost equally obvious: 1) Would a
library, periodical, research area really be
used by students? 2) Who would be
inconvenienced by the structure? 3) Can
a structure be built to meet the center's
needs at a reasonable cost? 4) Can a
structure be designed to meet the

University standards? 5) Where will the
money come from?
We have begun research or. this
project, and any help you have to offer
would be appreciated. With a little luck
and if answers can be found to the
problems, we might be able to put up our
own center during Spring.
LAND DEVELOPMENT:Stanford's impact on
the environment is probably felt most in
its land development policies. As an
example, the Jasper Ridge and Searsville
Lake area is a unique biological preserve
containing a vast variety of California
plants unequaled anywhere else in the
state. Last spring the Council urged
approval of a plan for the inclusion of
Searsville Lake in the academic reserve of
the University and in the Jasper Ridge
biological reserve. In December of last
year the Land and Building Development
Committee approved the proposal.
Review by the Board of Trustees is
expected shortly.
The proper development of Stanford's
lands has been of as much concern as the
preservation of undeveloped land. A
major study of Stanford land use by the
firm of Livingston and Blayney has been
underway since last summer. The firm has
analyzed which areas are suitable for
development for either commercial
properties or housing and which areas
should be preserved for academic
purposes.
The issues involved in this study are
complex, but of tremendous importance.
The Livingston-Blayney Report will
probably determine the nature of
Stanford land development for the next
ten years. To help students understand
the questions involved a re-issue of the
Campus Report article, "Questions and
Answers About Stanford Land
Development," will be distributed by the
Office of University Relations. The
Livingston-Blayney Report will be
presented to the Board of Trustees on
February 9th. At that time a more
thorough discussion of the proposals
made will be in order.
