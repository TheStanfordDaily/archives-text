# Negotiations Require Patience
## 
### CARY GLASS 
James F. Leonard, Assistant Director of the
U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency,
told a Cubberly audience last night that it may
belO, 20, 30or more years until we approach a
state of genuine disarmament. . . but I hope we
have the patience to carry through and not
abandon the enterprise."
Leonard who also doubles as U.S.
Ambassador to the Conference of the
Committee on Disarmament (CCD), described
the activities of that little known but important
Geneva-based body to an audience of about 100
faculty and students.
Although composed of 25 member-nations,
the CCD offers a setting, according to Leonard,
"like no other place in the world where the U.S.
and the Soviets can work in an informal fashion
and where so much progress has been made in
the last few years."
The progress described by Leonard includes
the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963 ), the
Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (1965 ), and a
more recent treaty prohibiting the deployment
of nuclear weapons in the seabed.
Another offshoot of the CCD negotiations
has been the bilateral SALT talk in Vienna and
Helsinki, which are private, closed negotiations,
in contrast to the open multilateral deliberations
of the CCD, which is U.N.- affiliated.
The emphasis at the CCD is not currently
directed at "complete and general
disarmament," according to Leonard, but rather
towards specific and more easily attacked issues
such as chemical and biological warfare.
Currently a stalemate exists between the U.S.
and U.S.S.R. on the CBW issue, principally on
the matter of chemical warfare agents.

The Ambassador stated that the Soviet Union
has presented a plan for limitation of chemical
and biological weaponry which "appears more as
a propaganda approach than as a serious arms
control measure."
According to Leonard, problems arise from
the definition of certain chemical substances as
warfare agents and from possible methods for
verification of compliance with any agreement

negotiated.
The present Russian government, says
Leonard, suffers from a "mania for secrecy
(about internal matters) that parallels that under
Stalin or Nicholas I."
Leonard denied that the use of tear gas or
herbicides by the U.S. in Vietnam was "at the
heart" of the CBW negotiations problem "as
some people claim."
