# Ehrlich Plans Course Options
## Law Dean Looks To Future 
### TOM GIVEN 
"I'm just beginning to learn what a
Dean does," says Thomas Ehrlich,
newly appointed Dean of the Law
School. "I'm glad I have until
September to learn the ropes."
He may be new to the post, but he is
no stranger to the problems and
possibilities of the office. The 36 year
old international law professor has been
instrumental in shaping the Law School
as it currently exists, and he anticipates
a future just as dynamic as the recent
past.
'Fascinating Time'
"It's a fascinating time in all
education," he notes, "and especially in
legal education. We're in the midst of a
number of important changes, and one
advantage of the Stanford Law School
is that it can move more quickly."
Just where are Ehrlich and the Law
School moving? "We're offering more
options to more students to break the
common pattern of most students
doing the same kinds of things at the
same time."
From a standard three-year course,
heavily laden with required courses, the
Law School curriculum is becoming
more flexible. A two-year porgram is
now available for non-professional
studies, while joint degree programs
enable law students to combine their
work with other fields, receiving both a

legal degree and an advanced degree in
another field. An extern program
allows out-of-class training in over a
half-dozen fields for periods of six
months, and the opportunities for
research have been increased with the
addition of new resources—both
facilities and staff.
'Pattern of Change'
"This pattern of change is a
hallmark of Stanford," he believes. "A
raison d'etre of a small school is
students and faculty working together
in small groups. As an institution it is
still large in terms of interest and
potential.
There is work going on—particularly
in legal aid and related fields that was
not done a decade ago."
The school is still far from
revolutionary, but then Ehrlich is far
from revolutionary himself. He is a
calm, reasoned reformer, who looks to
the future with patience.
Participation
"Law schools provide a training to
gain abilities to help with societal
changes, and also provide a forum
where different approaches to change
can be debated," he says. "That's the
kind of participation I mean."
Of William Kunstler, who disturbed
many in the profession by saying, "I
only defend those I love and those

whose goals I share," he has mixed
feelings.
"Often, those outside of law do have
a view of a lawyer as a hired gun. That's
not accurate." He questions that view
as well as Kunstler's. His own position
is somewhere in the middle. He is
uncertain of the answer, but interested
in it nonetheless.
New Course
"One of the things I'm working on is
a first-year course dealing with the
nature of the legal profession -
including the question of the unpopular
client."
While he currently has no specific

program he wishes to pursue in the
Dean's Office, he looks forward to the
unanticipated challenges of the job. "A
Dean can help those who want to
develop the school, in some way," he
says, "sometimes with the same
perspective, sometimes with a different
perspective."
I
Thomas Ehrlich looks to the future,
and is excited by what he sees, "There
is a cohesiveness and dynamism here
that has kept changing and developing.
At most other schools, it takes place in
a delayed reaction. You know, a lot has
happened here."

a future just as dynamic as the recent
past.
'Fascinating Time'
"It's a fascinating time in all
education," he notes, "and especially in
legal education. We're in the midst of a
number of important changes, and one
advantage of the Stanford Law School
is that it can move more quickly."
Just where are Ehrlich and the Law
School moving? "We're offering more
options to more students to break the
common pattern of most students
doing the same kinds of things at the
same time."
From a standard three-year course,
heavily laden with required courses, the
Law School curriculum is becoming
more flexible. A two-year porgram is
now available for non-professional
studies, while joint degree programs
enable law students to combine their
work with other fields, receiving both a

legal degree and an advanced degree in
another field. An extern program
allows out-of-class training in over a
half-dozen fields for periods of six
months, and the opportunities for
research have been increased with the
addition of new resources—both
facilities and staff.
'Pattern of Change'
"This pattern of change is a
hallmark of Stanford," he believes. "A
raison d'etre of a small school is
students and faculty working together
in small groups. As an institution it is
still large in terms of interest and
potential.
There is work going on—particularly
in legal aid and related fields that was
not done a decade ago."
The school is still far from
revolutionary, but then Ehrlich is far
from revolutionary himself. He is a
calm, reasoned reformer, who looks to
the future with patience.
Participation
"Law schools provide a training to
gain abilities to help with societal
changes, and also provide a forum
where different approaches to change
can be debated," he says. "That's the
kind of participation I mean."
Of William Kunstler, who disturbed
many in the profession by saying, "I
only defend those I love and those

whose goals I share," he has mixed
feelings.
"Often, those outside of law do have
a view of a lawyer as a hired gun. That's
not accurate." He questions that view
as well as Kunstler's. His own position
is somewhere in the middle. He is
uncertain of the answer, but interested
in it nonetheless.
New Course
"One of the things I'm working on is
a first-year course dealing with the
nature of the legal profession -
including the question of the unpopular
client."
While he currently has no specific

program he wishes to pursue in the
Dean's Office, he looks forward to the
unanticipated challenges of the job. "A
Dean can help those who want to
develop the school, in some way," he
says, "sometimes with the same
perspective, sometimes with a different
perspective."
I
Thomas Ehrlich looks to the future,
and is excited by what he sees, "There
is a cohesiveness and dynamism here
that has kept changing and developing.
At most other schools, it takes place in
a delayed reaction. You know, a lot has
happened here."
"I'm just beginning to learn what a
Dean does," says Thomas Ehrlich,
newly appointed Dean of the Law
School. "I'm glad I have until
September to learn the ropes."
He may be new to the post, but he is
no stranger to the problems and
possibilities of the office. The 36 year
old international law professor has been
instrumental in shaping the Law School
as it currently exists, and he anticipates
a future just as dynamic as the recent
past.
