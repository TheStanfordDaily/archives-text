PHNOM PEHN—Enemy commandos attacked
the Phnom Penh airport under cover of martar
fire early Friday and spread death and
devastation through the vital complex in the
heaviest blow at the capital since the outbreak
of the Cambodian war last March.
The renewed intensity of the fighting came
only hours after the Cambodian government had
reopened crucial Highway 4 which links Phom
Penh to the sea.
In that Cambodian government victory, the
Lon Nol regime received heavy air support from
American jets and helicopters called in from the
7 th Fleet ships in the Gulf of Thailand in
perhaps the heaviest U.S. air support role so far
in the Cambodian campaign.
Back in the U.S., Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird said Wednesday that he would
recommend use of U.S. air power in Cambodia,
Laos, and South Vietnam to protect American
troops as they withdraw.
"We will use air power, and as long as I am
serving in this job, 1 will recommend that we
use air power."
claimed that such assistance to
Cambodia - which in the recent South
Vietnamese offensive there has included
American helicopter gunships as well as
fixed-wing warplanes - fits the Nixon Doctrine.
Under that doctrine, Laird said, the United
States "is prepared to provide material
assistance and air and sea assistance to our allies
and our friends in Asia."
American aid, he stressed, stops short of
putting American combat troops on the

ground. "We're not using any ground combat
forces in Cambodia," he said. "And I can assure
you that we will not."
Secretary Laird also said he felt that the
assistance to Cambodia was not prohibited by
the legislation passed in Congress last December
30, barring U.S. advisers or ground troops in
Cambodia.
Meanwhile, reliable sources claim that
American advisers and South Vietnamese
officers are traveling together on command and
control helicopters in Cambodia and
periodically setting foot on the ground, despite
Pentagon assertions to the contrary.
These sources provided a partial
identification of an American who was
photographed on the ground in Cambodia last
Thursday. Two other Americans also were seen
on the ground by Western eyewitnesses last
Friday.
Oil Floats Away
SAN FRANCISCO — An oil slick continued
to spread in the Pacific Ocean off San Francisco
yesterday, but only traces were left in San
Francisco Bay as more than 1,000 workmen
and volunteers labored to clean up the water
and beaches.
Between 2,000 and 2,500 wild birds were
brought to cleaning stations where volunteers
removed gooey oil from their feathers. But Fish
and Game officials predicted more than 90
percent eventually would die.
The Coast Guard said the floating oil at sea
stretched from 3 miles off Pt. Reyes, north of
the Golden Gate, to near Half Moon Bay on the
south, a span of about 60 miles of coastline.

Under that doctrine, Laird said, the United
States "is prepared to provide material
assistance and air and sea assistance to our allies
and our friends in Asia."
American aid, he stressed, stops short of
putting American combat troops on the

ground. "We're not using any ground combat
forces in Cambodia," he said. "And I can assure
you that we will not."
Secretary Laird also said he felt that the
assistance to Cambodia was not prohibited by
the legislation passed in Congress last December
30, barring U.S. advisers or ground troops in
Cambodia.
Meanwhile, reliable sources claim that
American advisers and South Vietnamese
officers are traveling together on command and
control helicopters in Cambodia and
periodically setting foot on the ground, despite
Pentagon assertions to the contrary.
These sources provided a partial
identification of an American who was
photographed on the ground in Cambodia last
Thursday. Two other Americans also were seen
on the ground by Western eyewitnesses last
Friday.
Oil Floats Away
SAN FRANCISCO — An oil slick continued
to spread in the Pacific Ocean off San Francisco
yesterday, but only traces were left in San
Francisco Bay as more than 1,000 workmen
and volunteers labored to clean up the water
and beaches.
Between 2,000 and 2,500 wild birds were
brought to cleaning stations where volunteers
removed gooey oil from their feathers. But Fish
and Game officials predicted more than 90
percent eventually would die.
The Coast Guard said the floating oil at sea
stretched from 3 miles off Pt. Reyes, north of
the Golden Gate, to near Half Moon Bay on the
south, a span of about 60 miles of coastline.

PHNOM PEHN—Enemy commandos attacked
the Phnom Penh airport under cover of martar
fire early Friday and spread death and
devastation through the vital complex in the
heaviest blow at the capital since the outbreak
of the Cambodian war last March.
The renewed intensity of the fighting came
only hours after the Cambodian government had
reopened crucial Highway 4 which links Phom
Penh to the sea.
In that Cambodian government victory, the
Lon Nol regime received heavy air support from
American jets and helicopters called in from the
7 th Fleet ships in the Gulf of Thailand in
perhaps the heaviest U.S. air support role so far
in the Cambodian campaign.
Back in the U.S., Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird said Wednesday that he would
recommend use of U.S. air power in Cambodia,
Laos, and South Vietnam to protect American
troops as they withdraw.
"We will use air power, and as long as I am
serving in this job, 1 will recommend that we
use air power."

Cambodia - which in the recent South
Vietnamese offensive there has included
American helicopter gunships as well as
fixed-wing warplanes - fits the Nixon Doctrine.
