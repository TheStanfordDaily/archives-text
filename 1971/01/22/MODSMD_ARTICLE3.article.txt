# Kennedy Loses Senate Whip Job

### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-Sen. Robert C.
Byrd, an almost unknown legislative
technician, ousted Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, political glamor boy, from
the No. 2 Senate Democratic leadership
post in a stunnin? blow to Kennedy's
party stature yesterday.
Ironically, Byrd told newsmen, he
would have avoided the contest if Sen.
Richard B. Russell of Georgia had died
before the party caucus started in
mid-morning.
Russell died about 4 1/2 hours later.

Byrd, who has made a career of
doing favors for his colleagues in the
No. 3 leadership job, out-counted
Kennedy in a showdown decided 31 to
24 by secret ballot in the caucus held
just before the 92 nd Congress
convened.
Kennedy went into the caucus
thinking he had 28 "face-to-face"
commitments to retain the whip job he
won two years earlier by defeating Sen.
Russell B. Long of Louisiana, 31 to 26.
That would have been just enough

to win with 5 5 Democratic senators in
this Congress.
But Byrd told reporters "I am
known to be a conservative counter"
and that he did not finally decide to
make the race until he was certain he
had 28 votes.
The 28 th vote, he said, was a proxy
from Russell, lying critically ill at
Walter Reed Army Medical Center.
Byrd said that if Russell had died
this morning he would not have run
since his certain total would have been
reduced to 27.
