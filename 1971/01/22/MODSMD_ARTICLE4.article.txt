# Superblock: Downtown Boon Or Blight
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Next Tuesday, residents of Palo Alto
will vote in a special referendum to
decide the fate of the mammoth
development known variously as "The
Bryant Street Project" and
"Superblock." The referendum —
which is costing the city some $ 1 0,000
- will decide an issue that is one of the
most complex ever set before the
voters.
The survival or death of Superblock
will have great impact on the future of
Palo Alto's downtown area. It is a
question not only of "rejuvenation" of
a sagging business district, but also of
urbanization, of parking needs,
allocation of city funds, taxes, zoning,
traffic congestion, open space, high
rises, beautification, and indeed of the
very character of the City of Palo Alto.
The referendum will approve or
disapprove the implementation of the
Bryant Street Project, a zoning change
giving the City design and site controls,
and a complex agreement between the
City and developers Cornish & Carey.
3 -Acre Site
The project is proposed for a
three-acre site bounded by University,
Ramona, Lytton, and Florence. One
block of Bryant Street (between
University and Lytton Avenues) would
be closed and developed. Most of the
existing buildings on University and
Cogswell Plaza would remain
untouched. The proposed development
includes:
—Two 11-story office buildings,
each 150 feet tall, each with some
1 1 0,000 square feet of floor space.
—An extension of the ground floor

of one of the towers to house the Bank
of America.
—A separate two-story commercial
building, with approximately 10,000
square feet of space.
—A giant (1 200-space) three-level
underground parking garage, with
en'lanes, with entrances from Ramona
and Florence Streets. The City will
build, own, and operate the garage.
—Two acres of open space that,
along with adjacent Cogswell Plaza, will
create 2 1 / 2 acres of grass and
walkways on the "Superblock."
Of the three acres involved, 63% is
City property; this would be sold to the
developer (Cornish & Carey) for
$640,000.
The total cost will surpass $12
million, of which $4 million is the
Vimated cost of the City-owned
l \erground garage. Of that $4 million,
$8.0,000 would be contributed by the
developer; the remaining $2,1 40,000
would be financed by 30-year bonds
totaling $3,5 40,000, which will be paid
off by garage revenues and (in the event
that revenues prove insufficient)
assessments on downtown property.
Not Simple
But it's not quite that simple.
Opponents of the plan fear that the
project will woefully increase
downtown traffic and air pollution;
that the land is being sold at a price far
below its appraised value; and that the
City, in building the garage, is accepting
ownership of a money-losing, "white
elephant" that will serve no one but the
developers. They base their financial
predictions on a recent report of the
City Manager which indicates that the
garage may lose $1 02,300 in its first

year of operation, rather than the
$1 94,000 profit in net operating
revenues originally estimated.
The project's supporters contend
that the development is necessary to
"rejuvenate" downtown Palo Alto; that
the land price of $640,000 is actually
$40,000 above the appraised value; that
the City will receive an annual income
from the project (not including the
garage) of approximately $21 4 ,000 in
taxes — as opposed to $27,000 now;
and that Superblock, with its 2 acres of
open space, is a rare opportunity for
"controlled development."
The parcel of land in question first
came to the City's attention about
four years ago, when the planning

commission discussed erecting an
above-ground parking structure that
would span Bryant Street.
When the commission learned that
the Bank of America was planning to
build a new branch office at the corner
of University and Bryant, it proposed
that the bank and the City share the
parking structure. When the proposal
went to the City Council, Councilman
C. Grant Spaeth proposed a large-scale
development with underground
parking. In response, the Council
commissioned a land-use study.
Study
Two years later, in May 1 968, it
proposed a single 13-story office
building along with a raised plaza and

several smaller commercial buildings.
Councilman Kirke Comstock a
long-time opponent of the plan -
dubbed the concept "Superblock," and
the nickname stuck.
It was not until April 1 4,1970, that
the Council selected a plan submitted
by Cornish c. Carey, substituting two -
11-story towers for the original
13-story one. By that time, Palo Alto
resident Richard Rosenbaum had begun
to organize opposition to the project.
Rosenbaum's opposition was
originally based on his fears of
increased traffic and air pollution. At a
public meeting Jan. 19, he contended
that the downtown area is "already full
of cars." He was supported by
Councilman Kirke Comstock, who
noted, "More cars do not equal less
cars. .. I find it difficult to see a
1 200-car garage as something that will
reduce traffic."
But Mayor Jack Wheatley warned
that growth is a necessity. "A dead halt
brings decadence," he said, "and if the
project is rejected you're not going to
have a city as we have it today, you're
going to have less; you're not going to
have the quality of living you have
now, you're going to have less."
Support for Mayor
The mayor was supported by several
downtown shopowners, who expressed
hopes that the project would help halt
the flow of shoppers to more
convenient shopping centers, and by
developer Scott Carey. "The real issue
is not whether we will have growth or
no growth," Carey said, "but whether
we will have planned, controlled
growth .. . whether the City will
continue to grow in random, scattered,

unplanned, wall-to-wall office buildings
or not."
Rosenbaum called the project
"simply not compatible within the
suburban framework we have set up
here." It was also pointed out that an
increase in commercial development
(the project's tenants will eventually
employ over 900 workers) could only
intensify the area's already-critical
housing shortage.
Superblock opponents have also
criticized the $6 4 0,000 selling price of
the City's land as below the 1968
appraisal value of $875,000. Wheatley
and Comstock contended that the 1968
appraisal was based on the $11 per
square foot value of land zoned C-2,
and that an Oct. 197 0 appraisal of
$600,000, based on the lower value of
C-2-S land, is a more accurate price.
Zoning
C-2 land is commercially-zoned land
that does not require parking space to
be included with buildings; C-2-S land,
which requires parking space, is of less
value because less area is usable for
development. All hough the Superblock
land is apparently zoned C-2, Carey
called it "a hybrid" and explained that
the 1 970 appraisal was made in
reference to the specific Superblock
development plan, which included
relatively large amounts of open space
and the high costs of relocation Bryant
Street utility lines.
Also, noted Mayor Wheatley, the
City would only be selling on-and
above-ground rights-- "the City retains
all underground rights." That drew a
laugh from the audience and a
comment from Mr. Rosenbaum on the


SUPERBLOCK—The plans for the Bryant Street Project (above), which will be
voted up or down this coming Tuesday, have raised a storm of controversy
between environmentalists and city planners.
