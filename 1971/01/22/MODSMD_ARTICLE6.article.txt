pap smear
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to Mr. H. Stanton
Shelly's letter concerning the
$7.50 charge for a pap smear at
Co well:
1) Receiving a PAP smear at
Cowell without the current $7.50
charge would not be receiving
"free University contraceptive
health services at someone else's
expense." Each student pays
$26-$2B per quarter for health
care. Why should this fee, which
has affected over a thousand
women in less than one year, be
arbitrarily exacted? If some fee
must exist, (and this is not to say
that one should), why not for
something which affects both
sexes financially, such as overseas
shots? If you still see nothing

discriminatory against women in
this fee, what was the date of
your last PAP smear?
2) You might also consider the
fact that contraceptive care is not
an intrinsic need for women.
Because the male's active
participation makes contraception
a necessity, a PAP smear without
charge would hardly be a "gift"
from the predominately male
population of Stanford.
3) PAP smears are a necessity
in health care for all women,
regardless of whether or not they
use contracept : ves, and were
provided free of charge until last
spring. Doesn't the change in
medical policy over financial
reasons imply a warped system of
priorities?

In reference to Monday's
article "Activist Linked To
Cache," I would like to make it
clear that I strongly oppose
violence as a means of political
change. The bomb making
activities on our land took place
totally without my knowledge or
permission. As for Stuart Mcßae,
he is in Albuquerque working as a
neurosurgeon's assistant. I am now
working with the Institute for the
Study of Nonviolence towards a
nonviolent revolution.
