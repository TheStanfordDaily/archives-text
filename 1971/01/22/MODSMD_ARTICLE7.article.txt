## Health 'Reform'=Violence 
### 
I write to call attention of the
Daily readers to a quite serious
situation now affecting the
provision of health and welfare
care to the poor people of
California. In the past two
months, through a series of
cutbacks, the state government
has substantially reduced its
support for programs in this area.
The first major cutback was
through a series of extremely
complex restrictions and
prohibitions on the use of the
Medi-Cal program. Far more
important than the 10 per cent
cutback of doctor's fees has been
the severe restrictions on services
available and the creation of
paperwork barriers for doctors
and institutions who should be
paid for treating Medi-Cal
patients. The consequence of this
has been that many private

doctors have given up and will no
longer see these patients.
Organizations such as the
Neighborhood Health Center in
Kast Palo Alto, the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City
and even the Stanford Medical
Center are running periously close
to financial collapse because of
the cutback in funds.
Patients who cannot secure
care are being forced to use
county hospitals, in a return to
the old "charity" county hospital
of the past. These hospitals are
ill-equipped for the large influx of
patients and the counties are
having to divert large amounts of
money to meet increased needs at
these hospitals.
The state has also cut back on
promised funds to the counties
for a variety of public and mental
health programs. Programs in high
need areas like alcoholism, drug
abuse, delinquency and
community mental health have
been endangered and in several
instances completely wiped out.
These cutbacks were in part
made in response to a budget mess
in the state government around
the whole complex of social
welfare programs. On the whole,
people receiving welfare are
economically "marginal"—that is
they find it exceedingly difficult
to work to support themselves
either because of physical
limitations (blindness),
psychological limitations
(schizophrenia), social limitations
(dependent families) or because of
the poverty /racism cycle. When
the unemployment rate was
deliberately raised by the Nixon
administration, these people were
the "slack" and they were forced
out of the job market and onto
welfare. When an unemployed
engineer is competing with a

Saul ivasserman, m.rf.

Black high school drop-out for a
job, the engineer has a great deal
going for him.
Thus the rise in welfare
expenses for the state was very
much a consequence of a
deteriorating economic situation,
and the increased suffering of
poor people was an accepted
consequence of governmental
economic policies.
From all points of view, the
welfare system is not a good
one—it is unbelievably complex, it
doesn't do what it was designed
for, and neither the rich nor the
poor like it. What it does do is
reduce the suffering of the poor
just enough to blunt the worst
excesses of the class structure of
American society.
That thought is little help to
me as a doctor as I face people
who are the victims of political
chicanery and racist governments.
The pregnant woman who doesn't
see a doctor till the time of her
child's birth, the youngster whose
teeth are destroyed because there
is no money for the dentist, the
man who stops taking medicine
for his high blood pressure
because he doesn't have the
money for the prescription and
dies of kidney failure, the old lady
who dies quietly in an
overcrowded county hospital
waiting room—these people are
victims of a form of violence at
the hands of the government
which is all the worse because it
occurs slowly, covertly, and under
the guise of "reform."

the unemployment rate was

going for him.
Thus the rise in welfare
expenses for the state was very
much a consequence of a
deteriorating economic situation,
and the increased suffering of
poor people was an accepted
consequence of governmental
economic policies.
From all points of view, the
welfare system is not a good
one—it is unbelievably complex, it
doesn't do what it was designed
for, and neither the rich nor the
poor like it. What it does do is
reduce the suffering of the poor
just enough to blunt the worst
excesses of the class structure of
American society.
That thought is little help to
me as a doctor as I face people
who are the victims of political
chicanery and racist governments.
The pregnant woman who doesn't
see a doctor till the time of her
child's birth, the youngster whose
teeth are destroyed because there
is no money for the dentist, the
man who stops taking medicine
for his high blood pressure
because he doesn't have the
money for the prescription and
dies of kidney failure, the old lady
who dies quietly in an
overcrowded county hospital
waiting room—these people are
victims of a form of violence at
the hands of the government
which is all the worse because it
occurs slowly, covertly, and under
the guise of "reform."

I write to call attention of the
Daily readers to a quite serious
situation now affecting the
provision of health and welfare
care to the poor people of
California. In the past two
months, through a series of
cutbacks, the state government
has substantially reduced its
support for programs in this area.
The first major cutback was
through a series of extremely
complex restrictions and
prohibitions on the use of the
Medi-Cal program. Far more
important than the 10 per cent
cutback of doctor's fees has been
the severe restrictions on services
available and the creation of
paperwork barriers for doctors
and institutions who should be
paid for treating Medi-Cal
patients. The consequence of this
has been that many private

doctors have given up and will no
longer see these patients.
Organizations such as the
Neighborhood Health Center in
Kast Palo Alto, the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City
and even the Stanford Medical
Center are running periously close
to financial collapse because of
the cutback in funds.
Patients who cannot secure
care are being forced to use
county hospitals, in a return to
the old "charity" county hospital
of the past. These hospitals are
ill-equipped for the large influx of
patients and the counties are
having to divert large amounts of
money to meet increased needs at
these hospitals.
The state has also cut back on
promised funds to the counties
for a variety of public and mental
health programs. Programs in high
need areas like alcoholism, drug
abuse, delinquency and
community mental health have
been endangered and in several
instances completely wiped out.
These cutbacks were in part
made in response to a budget mess
in the state government around
the whole complex of social
welfare programs. On the whole,
people receiving welfare are
economically "marginal"—that is
they find it exceedingly difficult
to work to support themselves
either because of physical
limitations (blindness),
psychological limitations
(schizophrenia), social limitations
(dependent families) or because of
the poverty /racism cycle. When
the unemployment rate was
deliberately raised by the Nixon
administration, these people were
the "slack" and they were forced
