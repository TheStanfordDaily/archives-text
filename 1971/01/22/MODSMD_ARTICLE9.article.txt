# Injury In Morning Crash
## 
### 
A spectacular single car crash
on Junipero Serra Boulevard next
to Lake Lagunita early yesterday
morning resulted in injury to the
driver of the vehicle.
Clarence Cavanaugh, 40, an
Atherton resident, was reported in
good condition last night in
Stanford Hospital. The nature of
his injuries was not available.

Cavanaugh's 1971 Ford sedan
was demolished after it hit two
electric poles, rolled at least once
and landed on its left side.
Firemen, using a special
circular cutter, had to cut the roof
off Cavanaugh's car to free him
from the wreckage. He was rushed
to the hospital by ambulance.
