Thirty-nine years ago today, January 25, Stanford football
great, Ernie Nevers, retired from the gridiron. Called by Pop
Warner "the greatest of them all," Nevers said he was quitting
while "he was still in one piece."
They could have made a great movie about Ernie's weekend
football heroics and called it "Nevers on Sunday," but they
didn't. If you hear about any Stanford football greats either
retiring or signing, give our news office a call at ext. 4632.
If you'd like to advertise your own athletic prowess, give our
