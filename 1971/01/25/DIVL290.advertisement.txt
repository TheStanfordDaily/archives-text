"Produced as a documentary, the work by Solanas is pure dynamite, a
panoramic vision of Latin America today. It is absolutely necessary to see this
picture independent of all political history of cinema — PARIS MATCH."
"This work by the Argentine F. Solanas will have a place in the history of
the world cinema as important as the work of Sergei Einstein. It is an extra
ordinary film from every point of view. —"ACTUALITE ALGERIES."
