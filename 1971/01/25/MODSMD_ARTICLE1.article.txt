# Merchants Disagree On The Merits Of 'Superblock'
## 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
Should Palo Alto "revitalize" itself
through planned, landscaped
development such as the $12 million,
twin-towered Bryant
Street-"superblock" project? Or should
the proposal be rejected because of the
spectre of "Manhattanization"— too
many cars and people crowding the
streets, an uncertain financial future,
and a loss of the small town character?
Palo Alto merchants are caught up
in both sides of the controversy of
whether to approve the Superblock
measure in the special election
tomorrow.
Donald N. Klages, president of the
University Avenue businessmen's group
Downtown Palo Alto Inc., sees
Superblock as a necessary element for
the "revitalization" of the downtown
area. "The past ten years have
witnessed a total exodus of retail
trade," Klages asserted. In that time,
downtown Palo Alto has lost over 35
stores and has slid from the position of
a "vital shopping district to a second
rate area."
Beautification Solution
The Downtown president feels that
1 ,200 additional parking places are
needed to supply the current shoppers'
needs. He considers Superblock as a
solution to both beautification and
parking problems.
Others disagree. Neil Cordon, owner
of the Alto Hearing Aid Center on
University Ave., stated, "The city is
trying to part with the land without
bids, so we don't know the value of the
land ... So I'm agin' it." Cordon feels
that Superblock is "all right" as long as
the merchants do not have to pay for
it. "Cornish and Carey (the developers)

shouldn't expect the assessment district
to pay for their parking garage." When
asked if he thinks that a new office
building in Palo Alto might add to his
business, Cordon replied, "An office
building won't do a thing for business.
It will only clog the streets. People
don't want to park in a garage, they
want to park on the streets."
Howard Churcher, a photographer,
agrees that the merchants should not be
forced to pay for Superblock's garage,
but he firmly believes that the
downtown needs some beautification
project. He things that "they should
block University Avenue off at both
ends and make it a mall." Churcher
feels that the $3.5 million which the
merchants will be forced to pay for the
Superblock garage "could be put to a
better use."
Different Perspective
Les Kaplan, owner of Carlyle
Jewelers, disagrees. He feels that "the
proper type of building and planning
such as the Bryant Street
Project. . . with parks, landscaping and
shops, will bring a different feeling and
perspective to the downtown." His
assessment will amount to $15 more a
month and Kaplan says that, "even if it
were doubled," he could afford it.
"The merchants can afford the
increased cost of the assessment district
without having to pass the cost on to
the customer."
In response to peoples' fear of the
Manhattanization of Palo Alto,
Kaplan added, "Zoning laws can be
made to prevent additional skyscrapers,
but we need this one project to help
make the downtown a nice place to
work and shop."
Mrs. McMillan of the McMillan

Coffee store on University, is fearful of
the ecological ramifications of
Superblock. "1000 more cars a day
means more congestion and more
pollution," she said. Kaplan disagrees
with this. "Ten years ago before the
Stanford Shopping Center opened," he
insisted, "there was more traffic in
downtown Palo Alto than there is
today. We handled it then and we can
landle it now."
Concern With Unemployment
Some merchants like Louis Rapp of

Rapp's Shoes, are more concerned with
the unemployment problem in Palo
Alto. "There isn't a day goes by but
what we have two or three people in
looking for jobs," says Rapp.
Superblock is "an opportunity to
provide more jobs for Palo Alto. It
won't cost the taxpayers any money,
and it will take people off the
unemployment roles."
The Eldorado Insurance Co. which
owns the Hare, Brewer and Kelley
building on University has sent a letter
to the City Council decrying the

"unfair competition" which the
proposed city garage will give their
underground parking lot (which is
already losing money.) In their words,
"Think of how you would feel about
this if the city was subsidizing your
competitor and you were forced to pay
the bill for any losses he might incur
for many years to come."
Klages insists that the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages. He says
that the project will include 4 000 new
trees, new downtown lighting, and new
sidewalks and added that," the sale of

the city property will pay one-third of
the entire beautification program.
Klages feels that "with good planning,
(such as the Bryant Street Project),
more property owners will re-evaluate
their stores and remodle them." He also
stated that a revitalized downtown
would "bring in many new stores."
"The downtown," says Klages, "is
like an alcoholic. If you catch him in
time, you can cure him . . . But if you
wait too long, he keeps getting worse
and a cure soon becomes next to
impossible."

development such as the $12 million,
twin-towered Bryant
Street-"superblock" project? Or should
the proposal be rejected because of the
spectre of "Manhattanization"— too
many cars and people crowding the
streets, an uncertain financial future,
and a loss of the small town character?
Palo Alto merchants are caught up
in both sides of the controversy of
whether to approve the Superblock
measure in the special election
tomorrow.
Donald N. Klages, president of the
University Avenue businessmen's group
Downtown Palo Alto Inc., sees
Superblock as a necessary element for
the "revitalization" of the downtown
area. "The past ten years have
witnessed a total exodus of retail
trade," Klages asserted. In that time,
downtown Palo Alto has lost over 35
stores and has slid from the position of
a "vital shopping district to a second
rate area."
Beautification Solution
The Downtown president feels that
1 ,200 additional parking places are
needed to supply the current shoppers'
needs. He considers Superblock as a
solution to both beautification and
parking problems.
Others disagree. Neil Cordon, owner
of the Alto Hearing Aid Center on
University Ave., stated, "The city is
trying to part with the land without
bids, so we don't know the value of the
land ... So I'm agin' it." Cordon feels
that Superblock is "all right" as long as
the merchants do not have to pay for
it. "Cornish and Carey (the developers)

shouldn't expect the assessment district
to pay for their parking garage." When
asked if he thinks that a new office
building in Palo Alto might add to his
business, Cordon replied, "An office
building won't do a thing for business.
It will only clog the streets. People
don't want to park in a garage, they
want to park on the streets."
Howard Churcher, a photographer,
agrees that the merchants should not be
forced to pay for Superblock's garage,
but he firmly believes that the
downtown needs some beautification
project. He things that "they should
block University Avenue off at both
ends and make it a mall." Churcher
feels that the $3.5 million which the
merchants will be forced to pay for the
Superblock garage "could be put to a
better use."
Different Perspective
Les Kaplan, owner of Carlyle
Jewelers, disagrees. He feels that "the
proper type of building and planning
such as the Bryant Street
Project. . . with parks, landscaping and
shops, will bring a different feeling and
perspective to the downtown." His
assessment will amount to $15 more a
month and Kaplan says that, "even if it
were doubled," he could afford it.
"The merchants can afford the
increased cost of the assessment district
without having to pass the cost on to
the customer."
In response to peoples' fear of the
Manhattanization of Palo Alto,
Kaplan added, "Zoning laws can be
made to prevent additional skyscrapers,
but we need this one project to help
make the downtown a nice place to
work and shop."
Mrs. McMillan of the McMillan

Coffee store on University, is fearful of
the ecological ramifications of
Superblock. "1000 more cars a day
means more congestion and more
pollution," she said. Kaplan disagrees
with this. "Ten years ago before the
Stanford Shopping Center opened," he
insisted, "there was more traffic in
downtown Palo Alto than there is
today. We handled it then and we can
landle it now."
Concern With Unemployment
Some merchants like Louis Rapp of

Rapp's Shoes, are more concerned with
the unemployment problem in Palo
Alto. "There isn't a day goes by but
what we have two or three people in
looking for jobs," says Rapp.
Superblock is "an opportunity to
provide more jobs for Palo Alto. It
won't cost the taxpayers any money,
and it will take people off the
unemployment roles."
The Eldorado Insurance Co. which
owns the Hare, Brewer and Kelley
building on University has sent a letter
to the City Council decrying the

"unfair competition" which the
proposed city garage will give their
underground parking lot (which is
already losing money.) In their words,
"Think of how you would feel about
this if the city was subsidizing your
competitor and you were forced to pay
the bill for any losses he might incur
for many years to come."
Klages insists that the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages. He says
that the project will include 4 000 new
trees, new downtown lighting, and new
sidewalks and added that," the sale of

the city property will pay one-third of
the entire beautification program.
Klages feels that "with good planning,
(such as the Bryant Street Project),
more property owners will re-evaluate
their stores and remodle them." He also
stated that a revitalized downtown
would "bring in many new stores."
"The downtown," says Klages, "is
like an alcoholic. If you catch him in
time, you can cure him . . . But if you
wait too long, he keeps getting worse
and a cure soon becomes next to
impossible."

the proposal be rejected because of the
spectre of "Manhattanization"— too
many cars and people crowding the
streets, an uncertain financial future,
and a loss of the small town character?
Palo Alto merchants are caught up
in both sides of the controversy of
whether to approve the Superblock
measure in the special election
tomorrow.
Donald N. Klages, president of the
University Avenue businessmen's group
Downtown Palo Alto Inc., sees
Superblock as a necessary element for
the "revitalization" of the downtown
area. "The past ten years have
witnessed a total exodus of retail
trade," Klages asserted. In that time,
downtown Palo Alto has lost over 35
stores and has slid from the position of
a "vital shopping district to a second
rate area."
Beautification Solution
The Downtown president feels that
1 ,200 additional parking places are
needed to supply the current shoppers'
needs. He considers Superblock as a
solution to both beautification and
parking problems.
Others disagree. Neil Cordon, owner
of the Alto Hearing Aid Center on
University Ave., stated, "The city is
trying to part with the land without
bids, so we don't know the value of the
land ... So I'm agin' it." Cordon feels
that Superblock is "all right" as long as
the merchants do not have to pay for
it. "Cornish and Carey (the developers)

shouldn't expect the assessment district
to pay for their parking garage." When
asked if he thinks that a new office
building in Palo Alto might add to his
business, Cordon replied, "An office
building won't do a thing for business.
It will only clog the streets. People
don't want to park in a garage, they
want to park on the streets."
Howard Churcher, a photographer,
agrees that the merchants should not be
forced to pay for Superblock's garage,
but he firmly believes that the
downtown needs some beautification
project. He things that "they should
block University Avenue off at both
ends and make it a mall." Churcher
feels that the $3.5 million which the
merchants will be forced to pay for the
Superblock garage "could be put to a
better use."
Different Perspective
Les Kaplan, owner of Carlyle
Jewelers, disagrees. He feels that "the
proper type of building and planning
such as the Bryant Street
Project. . . with parks, landscaping and
shops, will bring a different feeling and
perspective to the downtown." His
assessment will amount to $15 more a
month and Kaplan says that, "even if it
were doubled," he could afford it.
"The merchants can afford the
increased cost of the assessment district
without having to pass the cost on to
the customer."
In response to peoples' fear of the
Manhattanization of Palo Alto,
Kaplan added, "Zoning laws can be
made to prevent additional skyscrapers,
but we need this one project to help
make the downtown a nice place to
work and shop."
Mrs. McMillan of the McMillan

Coffee store on University, is fearful of
the ecological ramifications of
Superblock. "1000 more cars a day
means more congestion and more
pollution," she said. Kaplan disagrees
with this. "Ten years ago before the
Stanford Shopping Center opened," he
insisted, "there was more traffic in
downtown Palo Alto than there is
today. We handled it then and we can
landle it now."
Concern With Unemployment
Some merchants like Louis Rapp of

Rapp's Shoes, are more concerned with
the unemployment problem in Palo
Alto. "There isn't a day goes by but
what we have two or three people in
looking for jobs," says Rapp.
Superblock is "an opportunity to
provide more jobs for Palo Alto. It
won't cost the taxpayers any money,
and it will take people off the
unemployment roles."
The Eldorado Insurance Co. which
owns the Hare, Brewer and Kelley
building on University has sent a letter
to the City Council decrying the

"unfair competition" which the
proposed city garage will give their
underground parking lot (which is
already losing money.) In their words,
"Think of how you would feel about
this if the city was subsidizing your
competitor and you were forced to pay
the bill for any losses he might incur
for many years to come."
Klages insists that the advantages
outweigh the disadvantages. He says
that the project will include 4 000 new
trees, new downtown lighting, and new
sidewalks and added that," the sale of

the city property will pay one-third of
the entire beautification program.
Klages feels that "with good planning,
(such as the Bryant Street Project),
more property owners will re-evaluate
their stores and remodle them." He also
stated that a revitalized downtown
would "bring in many new stores."
"The downtown," says Klages, "is
like an alcoholic. If you catch him in
time, you can cure him . . . But if you
wait too long, he keeps getting worse
and a cure soon becomes next to
impossible."

CROCK OF GRAFFITI—An unknown opponent of Superblock publicizes his position.
Should Palo Alto "revitalize" itself
through planned, landscaped
development such as the $12 million,
twin-towered Bryant
Street-"superblock" project? Or should
the proposal be rejected because of the
spectre of "Manhattanization"— too
many cars and people crowding the
