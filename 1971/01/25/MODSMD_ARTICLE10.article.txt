# Arguments: Pro & Con
## 
### 
Arguments for the Proposition:
1. The project provides a desirable solution to the
downtown parking problem with an innovative mix of
public and private ownerships in a single cohesive
development. The garage would provide underground
spaces for all-day parkers, thus making surface spaces
available for shoppers.
2. 70% of the land remains permanently landscaped
open space for public enjoyment.
3. The City and the School District should receive an
annual income from the project of approximately
$21 4,000 as opposed to $27 ,000 now.
4. Without the project, plans for renovation and
beautification of the downtown community would suffer
a serious setback.
5. It will help preserve the lowest municipal tax rate in
Santa Clara County.
6. Two independent studies show that the garage, when
it is in normal operation, will generate between $219,000
and $31 7,000 net income each year. The City estimates
the net income at $194 ,00 0 when the garage is in normal
operation.
7. The land is being sold at $40,000 above appraised
value (Oct. 1970. Desmond Johnson M.A.I, appraisal). A
previous appraisal was made without reiation to any
specific development and on the assumptions that no
parking requirements would be imposed, no land
(subsurface) rights retained by the City, and the developer
would have no unusual utility relocation costs.

(These arguments are furnished by the League of Women Voters.)

Arguments against the Bryant Street Project:
1. This project is unsound because of its financial and
environmental cost to the citizens of Palo Alto.
2. The City has agreed to spend $3-1 /2 million to buy a
garage that cannot possibly pay for itself. The potential
loss on the garage is $250 ,000 per year at 3/4 occupancy,
an amount five times greater than the revenue the project
is supposed to generate for the City. To cover any loss the
Council can levy assessments on the assessment district or
it can take the money out of the General Fund.
3. The City has agreed to sell two acres of public land
to a private developer at 2/3 of its appraised value. (Nov.
1 968 E.E. Brodd, M.A.I. Appraisal Report.)
4. The Agreement allows the developer to escape
parking assessments and to use $64 0,000 of public money
interest free for two years.
5. Traffic congestion from this project would require
expensive and extensive street widenings. The closing of
Bryant Street will further restrict traffic circulation
downtown. Even today, every street leading to downtown
is overloaded, according to the City's traffic consultants.
6. New Utilities and sewers serving the facility will be
paid for by the City taxpayers.
7. The City is to own and operate the garage, thereby
removing it from the tax rolls.
(The arguments given here are those made by proponents
and opponents of the measures. The League attempts to
report all the principal arguments, but does not, assume
responsibility for the content of the argument.)
