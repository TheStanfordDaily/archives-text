# Support For Bryant Street Project
## 'well-planned' One Councilman's Views 
### 
Stanley r. Norton

On Tuesday, January 26, the voters
of Palo Alto will have an opportunity
to endorse an imaginative, well-planned
development proposal that envisions
the best possible utilization of public
and private resources.
The Bryant Street Project is the
culmination of an effort to meet a
number of well-documented and rather
obvious deficiencies in a manner that
meets the high site and design standards
so characteristic of Palo Alto.
The aesthetic improvements brought
about by the design and character of
the Bryant Street Project will be
expanded to include the entire
downtown area through the street
lighting and beautification elements
that have been adopted as a part of the
total proposal. The completed Bryant
Street Project should not only serve as
a catalyst for further improvements to
the downtown community but will also

set the tone for the type of
well-planned, aesthetically pleasing
development that will arise in the
future.
The City has sought and followed
the expert advice of experienced
professional consultants throughout the
three-year development of this
imaginative plan. The parking facility
has been planned as a direct response to
a parking space deficiency documented
in a 1 968 report of the City's traffic
consultant. The sale of the City-owned
land will occur at a price based on the
professional appraisal of an experienced
Member of the Appraisal Institute.
Economic feasibility studies
undertaken by two independent garage
managers and operators found that the
parking garage could be supported
totally by those people who stand to
benefit from its construction—down
town property owners and persons

parking in the garage—with no
contribution being required of
residential taxpayers.
The support the project has received
from the people who have been closest
to the formulation of its final plans
gives further testimony to the wisdom
of the proposal. Nine of eleven City
Councilmen, elected to serve the best
interests of the community, have given
their approval to the project and have
been working actively for its support.
Four of the five members of the City
Planning Commission also endorsed the
proposal.
Even more significant, perhaps, is
the approval given the project by 78.5
per cent of the downtown property
owners, because it Is they who must
bear the cost of the parking, street
lighting, and beautification
improvements.

Palo Alto City Council.)


DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS—According to recent pro-superblock advertisements 80 per cent of the merchants and
downtown property owners approve of the project. Their contention has found support in the flourish of signs giving support
which have recently appeared. • • -» *•, V
