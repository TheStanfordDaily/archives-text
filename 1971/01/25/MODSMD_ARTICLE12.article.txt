# A 						Review Of Downtown Palo Alto
## 
### 
(The following historical perspective is taken from a
pamphlet prepared by the Citizens For the Bryant
Street ftoject.)
During the past decade, Palo Alto, as well as many
other cities, has witnessed the growth of outlying
shopping centers, thus causing the gradual decline of
its major downtown area. Major stores have moved.
Several stores have remained empty over a long
period of time. Sales tax revenues, due to dwindling
patronage, have been falling. What is the future for
University Avenue?
Past City Councils have been concerned about
the future of downtown Palo Alto. There have been
many studies, traffic reports, and economic
consultants brought in to make recommendations on
upgrading our only downtown area. Most of these
plans, studies, and surveys ultimately found their way
into the files—dusty and forgotten.
The present Bryant Street Project has a shorter and
more vital history.
Almost four years ago, the Bank of America
decided to build a new bank building on the corner of
Bryant Street and University Avenue and utilize the
parking lot, on the rear property which they also
owned, for customer parking.
Because the plan of the bank would function
better if it occupied the alley in the rear, they
approached the City for rights to purchase this
additional land. The City Staff and Officials,
recognizing that they had an obligation to the people
of Palo Alto to provide adequate parking and to halt
a gradual decline of the downtown area, saw this
problem as a creative challenge. They were aware that
the Police Department would be moving into the new
City Hall soon to be completed. Combining the
available City land with the privately held properties

presented a unique opportunity for coherent
downtown redevelopment.
At this point, the City of Palo Alto and the Bank
of America considered the possibility of a cooperative
effort between private enterprise and a public body.
This led to jointly financed studies, one on
architectural planning and one on economic
feasibility. The intent was to explore the potential of
unifying the hodge-podge of City owned and
privately owned parcels of land.
After this initial plan and report had received
widespread publicity, the City entertained proposals
for development of the combined parcel. The first
proposal was submitted by the firm of Hare, Brewer
and Kelley. This proposal presented an 18-story
office building and a complex financing formula for
the parking garage. After considerable discussion,
Hare, Brewer and Kelley withdrew this proposal.
The next proposal was submitted by the firm of
I.E.D. in cooperation with Texas construction
company. This envisioned a I 7-story office building.
The parking structure costs included in this plan
would have been based on a complex formula that
was never fully resolved.
The above two proposals revealed serious
discrepancies between real market value and the
figures submitted by Riches Research Company in
the initial economic feasibility report.
The third, and present, proposal submitted by
Cornish and Carey is similar to the previous proposals
in two respects only. If confirmed the fact that the
value of th<• City's land was $8,00 per sq. ft. rather
than $12.00, and that to be economically feasible,
even at $8.00 per sq. ft., this project would require

245,000 sq. ft. of building space as opposed to the
1 45 ,000 sq. ft. suggested by Riches Research Co.
At this point, Councilman Berwald questioned the
discrepancies in the numbers, i.e., decrease in the
price of the City owned land, and increase in building
space. It was at his urging that the City Council once
more hired an independent consultant, Optimum
Systems, Inc., (0.5.1.) to evaluate the entire project
and to determine whether the City was receiving
adequate compensation from the sale of its land.
The 0.5.1, report indicated that $8.00 per sq. ft.
for the City land was a fair value in light of existing
market conditions, comparable land sales, and rising
interest rates.
Since the Council had now received two conflicting
estimates on the land value, it obtained, for the first
time, a certified MAI appraisal. This Pinal appraisal
indicated that the value of the land should be placed
at $600,000 , or $7 .50 per sq. ft.
While the "numbers game" can be played by
proponents and opponents of the project, the
important fact to bear in mind is that the Palo Alto
homeowner will not be taxed one cent for the garage.
The downtown property owners will be forming an
assessment district. The costs incurred in building the
garage and its operation will be shared by them and
not the general homeowning public. The balance of
the project, of course, is being privately financed and
will in no way be an obligation of the City or the
taxpayers.
We feel that the* Bryant Street Project is a major
step in downtown renewal. It will provide 2 acres of
additional park-like space, and set a new trend for less
intensive property development. It will reverse the
gradual decline of our valuable downtown area.
Tomorrow vote FOR the Bryant Street Project.

At this point, Councilman Berwald questioned the
discrepancies in the numbers, i.e., decrease in the
price of the City owned land, and increase in building
space. It was at his urging that the City Council once
more hired an independent consultant, Optimum
Systems, Inc., (0.5.1.) to evaluate the entire project
and to determine whether the City was receiving
adequate compensation from the sale of its land.
The 0.5.1, report indicated that $8.00 per sq. ft.
for the City land was a fair value in light of existing
market conditions, comparable land sales, and rising
interest rates.
Since the Council had now received two conflicting
estimates on the land value, it obtained, for the first
time, a certified MAI appraisal. This Pinal appraisal
indicated that the value of the land should be placed
at $600,000 , or $7 .50 per sq. ft.
While the "numbers game" can be played by
proponents and opponents of the project, the
important fact to bear in mind is that the Palo Alto
homeowner will not be taxed one cent for the garage.
The downtown property owners will be forming an
assessment district. The costs incurred in building the
garage and its operation will be shared by them and
not the general homeowning public. The balance of
the project, of course, is being privately financed and
will in no way be an obligation of the City or the
taxpayers.
We feel that the* Bryant Street Project is a major
step in downtown renewal. It will provide 2 acres of
additional park-like space, and set a new trend for less
intensive property development. It will reverse the
gradual decline of our valuable downtown area.
Tomorrow vote FOR the Bryant Street Project.
(The following historical perspective is taken from a
pamphlet prepared by the Citizens For the Bryant
Street ftoject.)
During the past decade, Palo Alto, as well as many
other cities, has witnessed the growth of outlying
shopping centers, thus causing the gradual decline of
its major downtown area. Major stores have moved.
Several stores have remained empty over a long
period of time. Sales tax revenues, due to dwindling
patronage, have been falling. What is the future for
University Avenue?
Past City Councils have been concerned about
the future of downtown Palo Alto. There have been
many studies, traffic reports, and economic
consultants brought in to make recommendations on
upgrading our only downtown area. Most of these
plans, studies, and surveys ultimately found their way
into the files—dusty and forgotten.
The present Bryant Street Project has a shorter and
more vital history.
Almost four years ago, the Bank of America
decided to build a new bank building on the corner of
Bryant Street and University Avenue and utilize the
parking lot, on the rear property which they also
owned, for customer parking.
Because the plan of the bank would function
better if it occupied the alley in the rear, they
approached the City for rights to purchase this
additional land. The City Staff and Officials,
recognizing that they had an obligation to the people
of Palo Alto to provide adequate parking and to halt
a gradual decline of the downtown area, saw this
problem as a creative challenge. They were aware that
the Police Department would be moving into the new
City Hall soon to be completed. Combining the
available City land with the privately held properties

presented a unique opportunity for coherent
downtown redevelopment.
At this point, the City of Palo Alto and the Bank
of America considered the possibility of a cooperative
effort between private enterprise and a public body.
This led to jointly financed studies, one on
architectural planning and one on economic
feasibility. The intent was to explore the potential of
unifying the hodge-podge of City owned and
privately owned parcels of land.
After this initial plan and report had received
widespread publicity, the City entertained proposals
for development of the combined parcel. The first
proposal was submitted by the firm of Hare, Brewer
and Kelley. This proposal presented an 18-story
office building and a complex financing formula for
the parking garage. After considerable discussion,
Hare, Brewer and Kelley withdrew this proposal.
The next proposal was submitted by the firm of
I.E.D. in cooperation with Texas construction
company. This envisioned a I 7-story office building.
The parking structure costs included in this plan
would have been based on a complex formula that
was never fully resolved.
The above two proposals revealed serious
discrepancies between real market value and the
figures submitted by Riches Research Company in
the initial economic feasibility report.
The third, and present, proposal submitted by
Cornish and Carey is similar to the previous proposals
in two respects only. If confirmed the fact that the
value of th<• City's land was $8,00 per sq. ft. rather
than $12.00, and that to be economically feasible,
even at $8.00 per sq. ft., this project would require

245,000 sq. ft. of building space as opposed to the
1 45 ,000 sq. ft. suggested by Riches Research Co.

City Hall soon to be completed. Combining the
available City land with the privately held properties

presented a unique opportunity for coherent
downtown redevelopment.
At this point, the City of Palo Alto and the Bank
of America considered the possibility of a cooperative
effort between private enterprise and a public body.
This led to jointly financed studies, one on
architectural planning and one on economic
feasibility. The intent was to explore the potential of
unifying the hodge-podge of City owned and
privately owned parcels of land.
After this initial plan and report had received
widespread publicity, the City entertained proposals
for development of the combined parcel. The first
proposal was submitted by the firm of Hare, Brewer
and Kelley. This proposal presented an 18-story
office building and a complex financing formula for
the parking garage. After considerable discussion,
Hare, Brewer and Kelley withdrew this proposal.
The next proposal was submitted by the firm of
I.E.D. in cooperation with Texas construction
company. This envisioned a I 7-story office building.
The parking structure costs included in this plan
would have been based on a complex formula that
was never fully resolved.
The above two proposals revealed serious
discrepancies between real market value and the
figures submitted by Riches Research Company in
the initial economic feasibility report.
The third, and present, proposal submitted by
Cornish and Carey is similar to the previous proposals
in two respects only. If confirmed the fact that the
value of th<• City's land was $8,00 per sq. ft. rather
than $12.00, and that to be economically feasible,
even at $8.00 per sq. ft., this project would require

245,000 sq. ft. of building space as opposed to the
1 45 ,000 sq. ft. suggested by Riches Research Co.
At this point, Councilman Berwald questioned the
discrepancies in the numbers, i.e., decrease in the
price of the City owned land, and increase in building
space. It was at his urging that the City Council once
more hired an independent consultant, Optimum
Systems, Inc., (0.5.1.) to evaluate the entire project
and to determine whether the City was receiving
adequate compensation from the sale of its land.
The 0.5.1, report indicated that $8.00 per sq. ft.
for the City land was a fair value in light of existing
market conditions, comparable land sales, and rising
interest rates.
Since the Council had now received two conflicting
estimates on the land value, it obtained, for the first
time, a certified MAI appraisal. This Pinal appraisal
indicated that the value of the land should be placed
at $600,000 , or $7 .50 per sq. ft.
While the "numbers game" can be played by
proponents and opponents of the project, the
important fact to bear in mind is that the Palo Alto
homeowner will not be taxed one cent for the garage.
The downtown property owners will be forming an
assessment district. The costs incurred in building the
garage and its operation will be shared by them and
not the general homeowning public. The balance of
the project, of course, is being privately financed and
will in no way be an obligation of the City or the
taxpayers.
We feel that the* Bryant Street Project is a major
step in downtown renewal. It will provide 2 acres of
additional park-like space, and set a new trend for less
intensive property development. It will reverse the
gradual decline of our valuable downtown area.
Tomorrow vote FOR the Bryant Street Project.
