Downtown Palo Alto merchants feel
it is high time to speak for themselves
about the merits of the Bryant Street
Project and to squash efforts by the
opponents who are ascribing to the
merchants their own irresponsible
arguments about the high cost of the
project and why the merchants can't
afford it.
That the downtown business
community of small merchants
overwhelmingly favors the Bryant
Street Project is evidenced by their
support of the plan to pay for the
garage within the project, to pay the
necessary amount for its maintenace,
and to pay for the related
and lighting programs.
Merchants have teamed up with the
approximately 275 individual property
owners in the downtown assessment
district to share this cost. Residential
property throughout Palo Alto will not
be taxed for these projects and this
misconception should be cleared up
once and for all.
The plight of downtown has been
recognized since 1945 when shopping
centers were beginning to lure retail
outlets from University Avenue as a
new approach to merchandising. There
have been downtown studies,
neighborhood studies, mall studies,
parking studies, studies on
beautification and lighting, on traffic.
Over $100,000 in consultant fees and
staff time has been spent by the City of
Palo Alto on downtown planning and
the result.. . criticism, suggestions, but
no action because of the cost of the
suggested projects.
The Bryant Street Project, a proposal
carefully hammered out by the City
Council with strictest conditions ever
imposed on a developer for
underground parking, landscaped space
for pedestrians and required integration
with adjoining city-owned Cogswell
Plaza, is a plan that downtown
merchants and property owners not
only welcomed, but agreed to pay for.
Upgrade, Not Downgrade
With environment everbody's

concern, merchants, too, are concerned
about the environment for their
shopping customers and employees.
The project far surpasses the present
marginal use of the land and precludes
hodge-podge development on small
parcels in the same location.
The need for additional parking is
being questioned by opponents but
downtowners daily see the competition
for space in the Bryant Street shopping
area. This demand is not diminishing
and will be met by the proposed garage
and should take care of projected
needs.
The project will serve as a catalyst
for the revitalization of a presently
depressed business climate. Even now
merchants are plannign the remodeling
of their store fronts and rear exits
where needed.
New View
Instead of blocking off the Bryant
Street vista, as originally conceived by
the City, this particular plan will open

up a view from University Avenue and
beyond.
It is not the intention of downtown
merchants to support a series of
intensively developed commercial
blocks. A pattern of open design and
better use of surface land than just for
parking is what the Bryant Street
Project offers. Curb-to-curb high rise is
a thing of the past and the emphasis
now will be on investment that will
attract retail outlets to service adjacent
residents and Palo Alto generally.
Along with the handsome new Civic
Center, the Bryant Street Project will
focus attention on downtown as the
heart of a city concerned with
organized growth to up-grade, not
expand for the sake of expansion alone.
Palo Alto merchants and property
owners believe the Bryant Street
Project to be in the public interest and
foresee a declining downtown of which
no one will be proud if the project is
rejected.
