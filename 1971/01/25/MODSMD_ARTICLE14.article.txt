city's position
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Bryant Street Project which has been submitted for approval by the voters
at a special election on Tuesday, January 26 th, is the result of study by the
Council, the Planning Commission and the City Staff over the past three years.
It is the intent of the City to obtain a project that will benefit the City as a
whole and make the downtown area a viable business district by:
—Setting a trend for quality development that can be controlled by the Council
and the Planning Commission.
—Enhancing the quality of the business district environment with a long
overdue beautification, providing amenities for shoppers and employees and
residents of downtown.
—Upgrading the general area without expanding it.
—Providing convenience to shoppers with a well designed garage that would not
be paid for by homeowners through property taxes, but by downtown merchants
and property owners only.
—Making the area safe and more beautiful for everyone with improved lighting.
—Eighty percent of the Council, eighty percent of the Planning Commission
and eighty percent of the businesses and property owners which are paying the
Assessment District have approved this project.
The concept of the City working with a priv-.te developer is new and was
judged by the Council and Consultant to be the best way to use City owned
property in the downtown business district.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The real issue of the Bryant Street Project (BSP) election on Tuesday has been
buried beneath the rhetoric of campaign slogans.
Will the garage be a white elephant? No. The garage will operate at a deficit, but
this deficit will be paid for exclusively by downtown property owners and
merchangts. For the first time in years, these downtowners have overwhelmingly
agreed to pay the bill for underground parking, beautification and street lighting.
Is the land being sold at less than fair value? No. Two appraisals were made.
Opponents cite only the first, which was made in ignorance of the fact that Palo
Alto's main telephone trunk line bisects the site which would greatly increase tne
cost of site development. The second appraisal fully justifies the land price.
Will the assessments drive the small merchant out of town? No. Small
merchants on California Avenue pay a much higher assessment for their parking
and beautification than will the University Avenue merchant if the BSP is
approved.
Will the BSP add to downtown traffic congestion? Yes. It will add 600 cars a
day to a downtown traffic count now at 40,000 cars a day. Palo Alto completed
street widening plans which will go into effect regardless of whether BSP is
approved.
Will the BSP drive out low-cost housing from downtown Palo Alto? No. It
doesn't replace any. Unlike the proposed hospital site in last May's election, the
BSP is completely within the commercial district.
The real issue is the contribution of this project to Palo Alto's growth.
What's wrong with the project? Nothing. If you deal with the real issues.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The real issue of the Bryant Street Project (BSP) election on Tuesday has been
buried beneath the rhetoric of campaign slogans.
Will the garage be a white elephant? No. The garage will operate at a deficit, but
this deficit will be paid for exclusively by downtown property owners and
merchangts. For the first time in years, these downtowners have overwhelmingly
agreed to pay the bill for underground parking, beautification and street lighting.
Is the land being sold at less than fair value? No. Two appraisals were made.
Opponents cite only the first, which was made in ignorance of the fact that Palo
Alto's main telephone trunk line bisects the site which would greatly increase tne
cost of site development. The second appraisal fully justifies the land price.
Will the assessments drive the small merchant out of town? No. Small
merchants on California Avenue pay a much higher assessment for their parking
and beautification than will the University Avenue merchant if the BSP is
approved.
Will the BSP add to downtown traffic congestion? Yes. It will add 600 cars a
day to a downtown traffic count now at 40,000 cars a day. Palo Alto completed
street widening plans which will go into effect regardless of whether BSP is
approved.
Will the BSP drive out low-cost housing from downtown Palo Alto? No. It
doesn't replace any. Unlike the proposed hospital site in last May's election, the
BSP is completely within the commercial district.
The real issue is the contribution of this project to Palo Alto's growth.
What's wrong with the project? Nothing. If you deal with the real issues.

The Bryant Street Project which has been submitted for approval by the voters
at a special election on Tuesday, January 26 th, is the result of study by the
Council, the Planning Commission and the City Staff over the past three years.
It is the intent of the City to obtain a project that will benefit the City as a
whole and make the downtown area a viable business district by:
—Setting a trend for quality development that can be controlled by the Council
and the Planning Commission.
—Enhancing the quality of the business district environment with a long
overdue beautification, providing amenities for shoppers and employees and
residents of downtown.
—Upgrading the general area without expanding it.
—Providing convenience to shoppers with a well designed garage that would not
be paid for by homeowners through property taxes, but by downtown merchants
and property owners only.
—Making the area safe and more beautiful for everyone with improved lighting.
—Eighty percent of the Council, eighty percent of the Planning Commission
and eighty percent of the businesses and property owners which are paying the
Assessment District have approved this project.
The concept of the City working with a priv-.te developer is new and was
