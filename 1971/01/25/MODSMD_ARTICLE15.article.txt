Editor, THE DAILY:
Recognizing that Henry Cabot
Lodge's speech at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium was a direct insult to
the active anti-war community at
Stanford, we feel that the
disruption of his speech reflected
the attitudes of a significant
number of people. By selectively
prosecuting 10 people who have
been very active public-ally in
political work during the last two
years, we feel that the University
Administration was arbitrary and
patently unjust. Therefore, we
would be willing to confess to
sitting in the front row on this
occasion and vocalizing comments
that disturbed the "dignity and
decorum" of Mr. Lodge's
presentation. If you would also be
willing to make this statement to
show your recognition of the
arbitrary nature of the
prosecutions and to show your
opposition to the war against the
Vietnamese people which Lodge is
promoting, please sign this
statement and mail to Lodge
Protest, 168 Waverley St., Apt.
D 3, Palo Alto 94 301. Signatures
will not be made public until 250
names have been collected.

Dear Mr. Franklin,
Though it is critical that
alumni money once more come to
Stanford, it is unfortunate that
the University is prosecuting you
in the manner it has chosen. Since
you have a reputation of
excellence as an instructor, this is
apparently just one more example
of using a man's job as a whip
over his mind. While there may be
some question of the relevance of
your subject matter to the general
area within which you teach, this
only illustrates the academic
community's obsession with the
particular sort of paper a man has
as measure of his competence.
It has been reported that you
wished you had done more than
interfere with Mr. Lodge's
address. Certainly many of us who
abhor the violence which is being
inflicted upon the people of
Southeast Asia sympathize with
your wish to bring the architects
of death, futility and oppression
to some manner of justice. But
any such accomplishment would
be to do less not more than what
you are accused of having done.
By violating the principles of
freef speech guaranteed in the
Constitution, one runs the risk of
becoming an obsolete
revolutionary just as Mr. Lodge
has become an obsolete
statesman. One reason for this is

possible prosecution under the
1965 Civil Rights Act, which
makes failure to respect the
constitutional rights of another a
criminal act (the rhetorical
question of whether the right to
live is covered in the U.S.
Constitution is answered by the
apparent reluctance of Southeast
Asians to be governed by our
laws).
Another reason is an apparent
failure to perceive that revolutions
truly take place not in the streets,
but in people's minds- and that
can come only with some measure
of free thought. Each speaker
disruption, each fire-bombing of a
home, each window broken, and
each cowardly-unequal attack on
such dissenters as Mr. Ray White
is another stone in the "pharoah's
tomb" of the radical left.
Ego-tripping aside, your
impatience with the peaceful
revolution which is happening
around us is perhaps a real
concern for the hundreds of
thousands of third world lives that
will probably be lost to
imperialism during the next
generation. But do you express
the same concern for the many
lost in the recent avoidable
Pakistani disaster? Prophet of
doom is not a pleasant role. Yet
the convergence of diminishing
resources, unrestrictedly-increas
ing population, and an inevitable
decline in technological advance is

a coming reality even given a
decline in the inflated American
standard of living. The
consequence may indeed be
Malthusian disaster with survival
meted out according to Darwinian
law. Perhaps this is inescapable.
But perhaps it is not if all people
make at least some attempt at
rational dialogue.

wrong priorities
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been impressed with the
enthusiastic response of many
Stanford students to the plight of
our shore birds since the oil spill
in San Francisco Bay last Monday.
It has always bothered me,
however, that no one seems very
concerned about the thousands of
birds that have been dying for
years in Southeast Asia as a result
of United States bombing and
defoliation policies. Lots of small
forest animals have been killed;
besides, I think that we have lost
our sense of priorities.
