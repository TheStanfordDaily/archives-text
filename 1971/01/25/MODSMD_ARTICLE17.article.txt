# Race Horses Train At New Clinic
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
A whirlpool bath, a swimming
hole, an exercise track, and an
electrically-run "hotwalker" are
new features at the "racer's health
spa" for the rejuvenation of tired
race horses. The Portola Valley
Training Center is located on 8 0
acres of Stanford Land northeast
of the gold course.
Harness horses and
thoroughbred runners, worth
between $5,000 and $50,000 are
conditioned at the stables for the
leg-hammering racing season.
Other horses receive theraputic
treatment to speed recovery from
injuries, and some are turned out
to pasture for complete rest and
recuperation from the grueling
racing schedule.
Excercise Track
Each morning at seven the
horses are galloped on the
five-eights mile-long track. Harry
Conley, 1938 graduate of
Stanford and managing partner of
the stables, told the Daily that the
Center filled a definite gap in Bay
area stabling needs, since it is the
only training stable in northern

California with both swimming
and track facilities.
Conley, who divides his time
between the horses and a cattle
operation he has run on Stanford
land for the past 25 years,
explained the theory behind
exercising horses in the water.
"Swimming develops both
their muscles and their
cardiovascular capacity or
stamina, without being hard on
their legs. Race horses seldom
have good legs, and almost all of
the injuries we give therapy for leg
injuries. They even used to swim
horses in the surf, before these
facilities were available.
"About three minutes of
swimming exercises the horse the
same as galloping one mile," he
added.
He estimated that it requires
between three and six months to
train a race horse for the track,
depending on what his initial
condition is.
The trainer, Albert Foster,
begins the horse's training with
swimming from two to 15
minutes daily. Later, a day on the
track alternates with a day of
swimming. The day begins early,

since the horses are fed about five
a.m. and are ready to run by
seven, thus avoiding the hot part
of the day.
After exercise, the horse is
covered with a blanket and cooled
off by the hotwalker. This
machine rotates, leading the
animal in a circle at a walk until
he is dry.
The large water-filled hole has
a ramp for the horse to walk
down into the main part of the
swimming pool. A cement
walkway all the way around
anables the trainer to lead the
horse along. Part of the hole can
be sectioned off, and the water
pumped in for a whirlpool bath.
Therapy Pays
The special therapy seems to
pay at the race track. Conley told
the Daily that none of the horses
presently racing out of the stables
have finished in lower than fourth
place and about 50 percent have
been winners.
Two major racetracks, Bay
Meadows and Golden Gate, are
each less than an hour from the
stables. Since the racing season is
on for 30 0 days of the year, the

training center is busy year round,
both with breaking in young
horses and conditioning
experienced racers.
For the rest stay in the
pastures, the horse's owner must
pay $100 a month, and $5 0 more
monthly if the animal gets an
individual paddock. For a horse in
intensive training, the cost is $300
monthly.
Conley believes that the stables
benefit the University.
"It gets income from these
lands, which it needs," he stated.
"Also, this type of operation
leaves open spaces for people to
enjoy. We plan to do more
landscaping too."
Conley is also proud of the
quality of the Portola Valley
facilities. One gelding presently
boarding at the stables, for
example, won three out of three
races at Bay Meadows last year,
and after some races at Golden
Gate, should be on his way to the
Kentucky Derby.
Presently about 60 horses are
boarding at the stables, and about
a third are currently racing at one
of the nearby tracks.

minutes daily. Later, a day on the
track alternates with a day of
swimming. The day begins early,

since the horses are fed about five
a.m. and are ready to run by
seven, thus avoiding the hot part
of the day.
After exercise, the horse is
covered with a blanket and cooled
off by the hotwalker. This
machine rotates, leading the
animal in a circle at a walk until
he is dry.
The large water-filled hole has
a ramp for the horse to walk
down into the main part of the
swimming pool. A cement
walkway all the way around
anables the trainer to lead the
horse along. Part of the hole can
be sectioned off, and the water
pumped in for a whirlpool bath.
Therapy Pays
The special therapy seems to
pay at the race track. Conley told
the Daily that none of the horses
presently racing out of the stables
have finished in lower than fourth
place and about 50 percent have
been winners.
Two major racetracks, Bay
Meadows and Golden Gate, are
each less than an hour from the
stables. Since the racing season is
on for 30 0 days of the year, the

training center is busy year round,
both with breaking in young
horses and conditioning
experienced racers.
For the rest stay in the
pastures, the horse's owner must
pay $100 a month, and $5 0 more
monthly if the animal gets an
individual paddock. For a horse in
intensive training, the cost is $300
monthly.
Conley believes that the stables
benefit the University.
"It gets income from these
lands, which it needs," he stated.
"Also, this type of operation
leaves open spaces for people to
enjoy. We plan to do more
landscaping too."
Conley is also proud of the
quality of the Portola Valley
facilities. One gelding presently
boarding at the stables, for
example, won three out of three
races at Bay Meadows last year,
and after some races at Golden
Gate, should be on his way to the
Kentucky Derby.
Presently about 60 horses are
boarding at the stables, and about
a third are currently racing at one
of the nearby tracks.

EARLY MORNING DIP- Trainer at the Pwrtola Valley Training Center leads a race horse in training
around the Center's specially designed swimming hole.
A whirlpool bath, a swimming
hole, an exercise track, and an
electrically-run "hotwalker" are
new features at the "racer's health
spa" for the rejuvenation of tired
race horses. The Portola Valley
Training Center is located on 8 0
acres of Stanford Land northeast
of the gold course.
Harness horses and
thoroughbred runners, worth
between $5,000 and $50,000 are
conditioned at the stables for the
leg-hammering racing season.
Other horses receive theraputic
treatment to speed recovery from
injuries, and some are turned out
to pasture for complete rest and
recuperation from the grueling
racing schedule.
Excercise Track
Each morning at seven the
horses are galloped on the
five-eights mile-long track. Harry
Conley, 1938 graduate of
Stanford and managing partner of
the stables, told the Daily that the
Center filled a definite gap in Bay
area stabling needs, since it is the
only training stable in northern

California with both swimming
and track facilities.
Conley, who divides his time
between the horses and a cattle
operation he has run on Stanford
land for the past 25 years,
explained the theory behind
exercising horses in the water.
"Swimming develops both
their muscles and their
cardiovascular capacity or
stamina, without being hard on
their legs. Race horses seldom
have good legs, and almost all of
the injuries we give therapy for leg
injuries. They even used to swim
horses in the surf, before these
facilities were available.
"About three minutes of
swimming exercises the horse the
same as galloping one mile," he
added.
He estimated that it requires
between three and six months to
train a race horse for the track,
depending on what his initial
condition is.
The trainer, Albert Foster,
begins the horse's training with
swimming from two to 15
minutes daily. Later, a day on the
track alternates with a day of
swimming. The day begins early,

since the horses are fed about five
a.m. and are ready to run by
seven, thus avoiding the hot part
of the day.
After exercise, the horse is
