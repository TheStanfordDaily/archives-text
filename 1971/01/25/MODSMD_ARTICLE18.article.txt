# One More Try
## Wilbur Coffee House Opens 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Wilbur Coffee House has
once again opened its doors in its
annual attempt to pull off the
major miracle of staying in
business.
Joy Kelly, the place's new
proprietor, seems like a real
businesswoman until you realize
that she spent 100 dollars of her
own money reopening a place that
was affectionately known to its
past owners as the Penn Central
West.
"We opened it just as a
convenience for Wilbur people,"
Joy says. "We aren't interested in
money." I sure hope so.
Last year Wilburites had
looked on in wonder as an initial
5 00 dollar investment was able to
turn to cold Wilbur storage room
into a cold Wilbur storage room
with chairs, tables and a sink.
After two quarters the place
had netted profits of 15 dollars.
Needless to say, this isn't the sort
of thing you try and impress your
friends with when they tell you
how they bought IBM at 5 .
Incredible Business
But Joy is hopeful. "Business
our first week has been
incredible!" she exclaims.
Of course, business was
incredible last year. There never
was any. Boy was that incredible.
At any rate, Joy says that this
year the coffee house has already
made 15 dollars after only one
week of operation.
Last year the only way the
place could have made 15 dollars
in a week would have been with a
press and some green ink.
Joy now only has to make 85
dollars more to get back her initial
investment. Actually, Joy didn't
plan to invest her own money in
the Wilbur Coffee House, but
that's the Wilbur Coffee House for
you.
She had it all worked out so
that each dorm would help get the
place going by contributing 25
dollars to something called the
ASSU Wilbur Coffee House Fund.
Well, the dorms contributed the

money and the ASSU managed to
lose it. It's comforting to know
that this University is still
producing the kind of financial
wizards that gave this country
Herbert Hoover.
Joy has brought about many
changes in the coffee house,
foremost among them changing
the menu and streamling the
culinary operations. Boy, was that
a boring sentence.
Last year, the coffee house had
the unique distinction of
importing its food from Oakland.
It also got its food (if food is
defined as what people eat) from
some guy named Hank who was
the last living Mewauk Indian and
resided on a retreat three hours
from San Francisco.
$100 Mistake
Also Hank made the huge, or
rather the 100 dollar mistake of
investing 100 dollars in the coffee
house in return for 25 percent of
the profits. Unfortunately, the
only profits anybody could tell
Hank about were Isaiah, Elijah,
etc.
Hank hasn't been heard from
this year, but it was learned from
a friend of his that his car was
repossessed, his telephone

removed, and he couldn't get
together enough bread to buy a
stamp in order to write the Coffee
house the few things he wanted to
say to them.
This year the coffee house,
opens from 8 to 12 every night
and until 2 on weekends, has
doughnuts, pie, cake, and hot
cider, which Joy buys at the local
supermarket.
As far as the atmosphere of the
place goes, which isn't real far,
there was one way to describe the
heaterless place last year, cold.
This year, a new heater has
supposedly changed all that, but
an old regular from last year
described this year's coffee house
as "just as bad."
"No one has ever made any
genuine attempt to create any
atmosphere in this place cough
cough," he said as he choked on
his doughnut in a series of off the
cough remarks.
"Why did you paint the walls
that awful color?" he asked Joy
further describing the walls as
"general puke."
People's Graffiti
Joy points out that she
eventually hopes to have graffiti
cover up most of the wall's off

yellow, color paints are on the
counter, to encourage such action.
But unfortunately, the idea of
people's graffiti has not turned
out too well, mainly due to the
mentality of the author's of
graffiti. Since I'm supposed to
take up alot of space with this
article, I'll give a few examples.
Let's Go Knicks.
Kumu?
First, Second, Neutral, Park,
Hie thee hence you leafy narc.
Graffiti is caused by running
barefoot through the graff.
Another innovation, equally as
unsuccessful, as the graffiti has
been the idea of a suggestion box.
Someone had the original idea to
rip off the top of a garbage can
with a push in flap and paint on
it. Apparently the someone did
not paint the "suggestions"
enough so that the box is
currently full of garbage.
All in all, the idea of Wilbur
Coffee House, a place in where
people can go, drink coffee and
rap seems like a great idea. But for
some strange reason it's usually
only the people who run the place
that figure out how great an idea
it is.
At any rate, looking to the
future, Joy eventually hopes,
when she has paid off her initial
debt, to sell all the food at cost,
but whether or not she succeeds
depends on whether Wilburites
decide that the place is their cup
of tea, or rather coffee.
