# Indians Will Face Missouri Next Year
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In all probability, Stanford's
football team will open its 1971 season
on September 11th in Columbia,
Missouri against the Missouri Tigers. It
will be 'he first meeting between the
Indians and Missouri, one of the
perennial powers of the Big Eight
Conference.
This game has yet to be officially
announced by either school, but on
Friday, Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor said that he is only
waiting for a letter from Missouri which
will make it official.
The game was negotiated while
Taylor was attending the NCAA
convention in Houston earlier this
month. It was arranged shortly before
Dan Devine, Missouri's former coach
and athletic director left to take the
head coaching job at Green Bay.
Army Game
Tentative travel plans call for the
Stanford team to stay in the east for a
week following the game, before facing
Army at West Point on September 18.
Taylor had received permission from
the Student Faculty Athletic
Committee to schedule an 11 th game
for each season through 1 97 7 and a lot
of discussion went on at the NCAA
convention.
Earlier attempts had been made to
schedule a game with a couple of Big
Ten and Ivy League teams, but neither
league league will yet allow their
members to play the extra game. Notre
Dame was also approached, but they
also cannot play an 11 th game as of
now.
Taylor said that Stanford really

wanted the 11th game, since their
second game previously would've been
the league opener with Oregon on
September 25. He said that since all
other schools in the league had two
games before their conference opener,
Coach John Ralston particularly
wanted the game to give his team equal
pre-season competition.
In 1972, Stanford is already
scheduled to play 11 games, ending the
season on December 2nd at Hawaii. In
the next few weeks. Taylor will be
busily working at getting 11th games
scheduled for the other seasons,
through 1 977.
The other extra games will probably
be against Southeastern or
Southwestern Conference or
independent opponents. Penn State and
Tulane are among those prominently
mentioned as possibilities. In 1977 the
Indians will probably be facing
Colorado in the extra contest.
Feasley Leaves
In other football news, assistant
coach Ed Peasley has accepted the head
coaching job at Northern Arizona
University. Northern Arizona, formerly
known as Arizona State College, is a
member of the Big Sky Conference.
Peasley, who coached the Stanford
linebackers, will stay and help Ralston
for a few weeks before making the
permanent move to Arizona.
Finally, this Thursday the
professional football draft will be held
in New York, with Jim Plunkett
expected to be the number one pick.
Tight end Bob Moore, defensive tackle
Dave Tipton, and center John Sande
are also expected to be early picks.
