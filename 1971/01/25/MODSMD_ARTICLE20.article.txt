# Stanford Tracksters Give The Big Boys A Good Race
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Jim Ryun, Randy Matson, Lee
Evans, Willie Davenport, Dick
Fosbury and Gerry Lindgren.
MOst of the "biggies" were at the
Examiner All-American Track
Meet in San Francisco Friday
night. Some won. Some didn't.
Evans easily won the 440 in
49.1. Fosbury finished way out of
the money in the high jump, as he
couldn't even flop over seven feet.
And Lindgren finished second to
Austrailian Kerry Pearce in the
two mile.
But the event everyone was
waiting for was the mile run.
Shortly before 11:00 p.m., five
runners started lossening up in
front of the group of officials
around the starting area. Two
were from Stanford, one was from
Washington State and one was
from Cal-State Hayward.
But the one everyone was
watching was the one whose
college days had ended a few
years back. After 19 months away
from competition, the world
record holder, Jim Ryan, had
returned.
Stanford Milers
The two Stanford runners, first
Arvid Kretz and then Duncan
Mac Donald led for most of the
way. But with 3 1 /2 laps to go,
what everyone was waiting for,
happened.
The long, lanky Kansan picked
up bis heels and flew by
Mac Donald. Once he took off, he
wasn't going to be caught. It was
just like the earlier days. His time
wasn't earth-shattering, 4:0-1 to be
exact, but it was good enough.
Mac Donald finished second in
4:10.2 and Kretz was fourth in
4:14.4. Mac Donald said, "I didn't
feel very great and the pace was
too slow. I haven't run indoors
enough to know how to pace
myself. I knew Ryun would make
his stretch run, but I didn't know
when he'd do it."
In the hurdles, there isn't
anytime to worry about pacing
yourself. In fact there really isn't
any time to even think. Rick
Tipton, who finished third behind
Davenport and Lance Babb
pointed that out.
Can't Think
"I got out ahead and I started
thinking. That's where I lost it. I
came out well. I shouldn't have
thought, but I did. I was
nervous."
Tipton's time of 7.2 was still
quite good and it looks as if the
senior hurdler may finally regain
the form which won him the
Pac-8 hurdle title two years ago.
last year he was noticeably
slowed by some hamstring muscle
pulls, hut it now looks as if he is
completely healthy.
Shortly after the hurdles were
over, the attention of t he capacity
crowd shifted to the other big
event of the night, the shot put.
Handy Matson had tied the world
irH'v in.. :*k of 67-10 a week ear
lier in I^>s Angeles and the 13,815

fans were looking for another
record-setting performance.
They got their new world's
record, but the short-haired
Texan wasn't the man who set it.
A long-haired, mustachioed
weightman named A 1 Feuerbach
tossed the big ball 68 feet 11
inches, to wipe out Matson's mark
by over a foot.
Four Tries Left
Matson still had four throws
left and as the officials checked
and re-checked Feuerbach's
throw, he paced up and down the
banked track like a caged animal.
Four times he stepped into the
circle, turned, grunted and
released the shot. And four times
it fell short of Feuerbach's record.
As Matson's final attempt
landed short and he threw a towel
down in Jisguist, the ex-Emporia
State start, Feuerbach, smiled and
passed up his final throw. He
could rest secure, knowing that no
one could take away his mark, at
least for tonight.
But as the television and
newspaper men gathered around
Ryun and Feuerbach, other
Stanford athletes were performing
well.
Casey Carrigan, a high school
Olympian, cleared 1 6 feet in the
pole vault, showing that the injury
problems that plagued him last
year may be over. He feels he may
be ready to work back towards

the 1 7'4 3/4" mark he reached in
high school.
No Injuries
"I felt really, really rusty. But I
don't think I have any injury
problems, and I'm looking
forward to the outdoor season.
I've had very little indoor
experience and I felt pretty good
about tonight's performance."
Don Kardong, Stanford's
outstanding cross country
performer, was bothered by an
Achilles injury and finished last in
a five-man two mile field with a
time of 9 :10.2 .
In the final event of the night,
Stanford's mile relay team
finished second to California in a
time of 3:25.1. Freshman Rufus
Shaw, hurdler Mark Haight, Tom
Long and halfmiler Peter Fairchild
composed a makeshift team which
performed admirably.
The Indians led up until the
last leg, when Cal's freshman ace,
Rick Brown, turned it on to give
Cal the win. After the race,
Stanford's coach Payton Jordan
went over to the relay team
members and said, "We're proud
of you guys."
Jordan was obviously pleased
also with Tipton, Carrigan,
Mac Donald and the others who
had looked sharp for this early in
the year. He was looking forward
to the outdoor season in which
these and others might bring
Stanford back to track
prominence.

LONG TO FAIRCHILD—And the Indian Mile-Relay team swings into the final quarter mile. At this
point Stanford led—to the surprise of thousands at the All-American Games Friday night. The makeshift
team, which also included Rufus Shaw and Mark Haight, performed admirably, only losing to a
blitzkreig sprint by California's Rick Brown in the last 11 0 yards. Co-Meet Director and coach Payton
Jordan said it all: "We're proud of you guys!"
