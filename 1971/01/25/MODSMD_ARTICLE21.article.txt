# A 						Different Breed Of Track
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Indoor Irack isn't the same
animal in California.
And that isn't so much the
fault of anyone as California
herself. She doesn't need indoor
track. Her indoor track belongs
quite properly outdoors.
It's like playing rugby when
you should be playing football.
Friday's Examiner
Ail-American Games was an
import. What was presented as
indoor track was really only the
very basics—the indoor arena, the
banked track, the large crowd, the
altered distances.
Missing were the mystique and
the history.
The All-American Games were
disappointing—at least for a
transplanted Easterner who grew
up with the idea that outdoor and
indoor track were wholly separate
en tities.
How so?
"It is a small world with a brass
band," wrote Sports Illustrated's
Tex Maule in 1 961.
Microcosm
"This is a microcosm, whereas
outdoor track, because of the
distance between watcher and
preformer, is a macrocosm, with
impersonal figures acting out a
soundless drama—too far away to
seem human.
"In the smoke and noise and
confusion indoors, the athletes are
one with the spectator, close and
very human."
Everything in indoor track is
smaller, closer, and more intense.
The longer races are tactical
battles of small, dramatic laps.
The sprints are seconds of speed.
The jumps and vaults are swirls of
motion.
There is more body contact,
more violence, more drama up
close. And the action is
continuous—there is constantly
someone running, jumping, or
throwing.
It's constant competition for
audience attention; a human
circus. An organ thumps in the

background. A Huge crowd cheers
and mutters. Athletes strain and
groan in the oval pit.
The entire spectacle belongs
quite properly in an arena. The
crowd is on top of every event,
every athlete, every move, every
emotion.
"Even the field events have an
immediacy indoors that they lack
outdoors," wrote Tex Maule.
"The pole-vaulter, pulling,
turning, and pushing off the pole,
rises to eye level of the first
balcony.
Sudden Stillness
"You can study the
concentrated face of a high
jumper as he waits in the sudden
stillness that comes before the big
jump and, by his footfall, count
the steps in his approach, and hear
the squeak of shoe on wood when
he takes off."
Some of this was present at the

Sports Commentary

Ail-American Games.
There was, of course, the
intimate drama of a spurned Jim
Ryun returning triumphantly to
the boards. There was the high
drama of an unknown shotputter
besting the very finest, Randy
Matson, with a world-record toss.
And all 13,000 spectators were
only yards away from A 1
Feuerbach and his wonderful
triumph.
There was a lot missing, too.
Sunny California
Indoor track doesn't belong in
sunny California. Real indoor
track athletes don't drive up to a
meet with their car's top down.
Real indoor track athletes
arrive at the meet with red cheeks,
mufflers, thick varsity jackets, and
snow on their shoulders.
For California, indoor track is
really a foreign sport, with foreign
restrictions, and foreign events.
After the All-American Games,
athletes talked of how well they

would do in the upcoming
outdoor season.
Real indoor track athletes
wouid talk of the succeeding
weeks of indoor meets and of
their indoor specialties. Outdoor
track, for them, is many months
away.
Separate Sport
The athlete here takes time off
from his training to run indoors.
It is not a separate sport for
him—as it is for his brothers in the
Midwest and East.
For thousands upon thousands
of college, high school, and
amateur track athletes, the sports
are completely different, the
techniques different, the running
conditions different, the emotions
different, and even the seasons
different.
An indoor track state
championship is equally
impressive beside an outdoor state

championship. It's equally hard to
win. Some schools seem to put
together two completely different
squads—seme schools can't do a
thing outside.
Coaches teach their protegees
techniques for mastering the
60-yard high hurdle race. In the
Spring they will teach a new
event—the 120-yard high hurdles.
Running Corridors
For a schoolboy athlete in the
New York metropolitan area, to
take only one example, practice
means running the corridors of his
high school and putting the shot
in his gym.
Every Saturday—and
Wednesday night, if he competes
in AAU all-comers meets—the
athlete travels to Jersey City, or
Newark, or to the 168 Street
armory in New York to compete
indoors. If his school's 88 0 or
Mile relay team is particularly
fantastic, he might even compete
in Madison Square Garden.

The schoolboy athlete learns
how to run indoors on a flat,
unbanked, splintery armory floor.
He learns the peculiarities of his
event. If he is a hurdler, he will
learn soon that his race is an
explosion from the blocks, an
eight-second (or swifter) burst
over four hurdles, and a dive into
the tape—and instant braking, or
he'll hit the onrushing armory
wall.
Pungent Odors
He learns to run in the midst of
clamor and excitement. He gets
'psyched' on the pungent odors of
new and old cigar smoke, rubbing
liniment, oranges, ham
sandwiches, and athletes in close
proximity.
He learns to run—and to
lose—in front of thousands of
fellow athletes, spectators, girl
friends, coaches, and parents, who
are often no farther away than the
balcony above his first hurdle or
above his high-jump bar.
It is a wholly different
sport—and it is taught as
such—from that of outdoor track.
There is perhaps another
element to indoor track—that of
the spectator, the aficionado of
indoor track, because he is a breed
all his own. He was so
conspicuously missing from the
All-American games crowd Friday
night.
Opera Buffs
"The people who attend the
big indoor meets are like opera
buffs," wrote the New Yorker a
few years ago. "You seldom see
them anywhere else, and they buy
up all the tickets weeks in
advance.
"As nobody else thinks of a
track meet very long before it
happens, the enthusiasts are the
only ones who get there, and one
of their chief prides is saying,
afterward, that they saw some
chap or other break a record.
"It's as if they had once heard
Tetrazzini sing "Rigoletto."
No where was this more in
evidence than at the final track
meet in the old Madison Square
Garden. Jim Ryun was running
the last mile on the historic
Millrose Games oval, and the
mement he stepped onto the
boards, thousands of devotees
rose to their feet, many openly
weeping with emotion.
And as the Garden rocked with
cheers, Ryun stepped off a 3 :5 7 3
indoor mile in response.
Metropolitan Sport
Indoor track is perhaps, then,
only a metropolitan sport. And
perhaps it really is only a Midwest
and Eastern sport. But its identity
is really so much more than was
presented Friday night at the Cow
Palace.
The New Yorker summed it up
well: "Competitive running
outdoors has always struck us,
and most other New Yorkers, as
mildly bizarre.
"Indoor track meets, though,
have always been phrenetically
popular here; the over-heated lake
of carbon dioxide thinly laced
with oxygen that fills Madison
Square Garden on such occasions
offers justification for the athletes
who race about in shirts and
shorts.
"The whole ambiance is at
once intimate and insane, with a
good healthy metropolitan reek of
hot dogs and beer to cut the
cigarette smoke, and the
sixteen-pound shots narrowly
missing unwary high jumpers."

NO TIME FOR THOUGHT—Unfortunately for Rick Tipton, that's exactly what he did, and, in the
60-yard hurdles when you start to think is when your opponents start to catch you. Above is the
result—Willie Davenport snapping the tape two steps ahead of Tipton.
