Utah's Redskins withstood
Stanford's charge late in the
second half and whipped the
Indians, 99-91, in Maples Pavilion
Saturday night. Trailing 78-62
with 8:34 left in the game, the
Indians led by guard Dennis
O'Neill closed the gap to eight
points 78-70 in the next two
minutes.
However, the superior
rebounding strength of Utah
asserted itself in the person of
6 '10" Jim Mahler who tipped in
three baskets in a row to put the
game out of reach. The win
evened Utah's record at 8-8 while
Stanford dropped to a 4 -11 slate.
Stanford had battled the
Redskins to a virtual draw in the
first half, trailing 4 9-48 as the
teams hit the locker room. Claude
Terry and O'Neill had paced the

Indians with 14 and 10 points. In
the important rebounding
category Stanford actually held
the advantage 25-21. Utah's
Mahler was limited to 6 while
Terry surprisingly hauled down 9.
Unfortunately, the early going
in the second half wrote the story
lor the rest of the game. Mahler
used his four inch height
advantage to its full extent.
Stanford wasn't able to block him
out and keep him off the boards
at all and, as a result, he scored 17
points and hauled down 11
rebounds.
With guard Mike Newlin's help,
Utah raced from a 59-55 lead to a
7 3-57 lead with 1 0 minutes left in
the game. From that point the
outcome was never in great doubt.
Some nifty inside shooting by
Dennis O'Neill and Clause Terry's
ball handling closed the gap, but
at the critical points Utah
matched the Indians basket for
basket.
The statistics pointed up
Stanford's crying need of a big
man to at least clog up the middle
and take a bit of the rebounding
chores off the shoulders of Mike
Michel, Pat Stevens, Chuck
Moore, and Claude Terry. In the
second half, Utah ripped Stanford
on the boards, 37-22, getting
second and third chances on their
shots.
Mike Michel had some success
with Mahler when Stanford had

the ball by drawing him outside.
Michel finished with 16 points,
most of them from fifteen feet.
But on defense Mahler's bulk was
just too much for the 6 '6 " Michel
to handle.
If Mahler wasn't enough of a
problem, Newlin continually hurt
Stanford with his hot hand from
the outside. Mahler and Newlin
finished with 51 of Utah's 99
points, but the whole Utah team
actually scored in double figures.
Though O'Neill had 24 points and
Terry netted 23, the lack of last
weekend's tough defense killed
Stanford.
The freshman team ran
roughshod over a pathetic JV
team from the University of
California at Davis. Flaying
without Steve Shupe who was
sidelined with a sprained ankle,
the frosh demolished the Aggies,
8 0-62.
The game was never a contest
as the front line of Jim Helbush,
Mike Mann, and Dan Broderiek
established their superiority
immediately. Playing less than
half the game, Helbush led all
scores with 11 points.
Midway through the first half.
Coach "Bub" Bowling emptied his
bench. The score continued to
escalate to a 26 point bulge at the
half, 5 3-27. The second half
prolonged the debacle and only
the final buzzer ended the
slaughter at 80-62.

Michel, Pat Stevens, Chuck
Moore, and Claude Terry. In the
second half, Utah ripped Stanford
on the boards, 37-22, getting
second and third chances on their
shots.
Mike Michel had some success
with Mahler when Stanford had

the ball by drawing him outside.
Michel finished with 16 points,
most of them from fifteen feet.
But on defense Mahler's bulk was
just too much for the 6 '6 " Michel
to handle.
If Mahler wasn't enough of a
problem, Newlin continually hurt
Stanford with his hot hand from
the outside. Mahler and Newlin
finished with 51 of Utah's 99
points, but the whole Utah team
actually scored in double figures.
Though O'Neill had 24 points and
Terry netted 23, the lack of last
weekend's tough defense killed
Stanford.
The freshman team ran
roughshod over a pathetic JV
team from the University of
California at Davis. Flaying
without Steve Shupe who was
sidelined with a sprained ankle,
the frosh demolished the Aggies,
8 0-62.
The game was never a contest
as the front line of Jim Helbush,
Mike Mann, and Dan Broderiek
established their superiority
immediately. Playing less than
half the game, Helbush led all
scores with 11 points.
Midway through the first half.
Coach "Bub" Bowling emptied his
bench. The score continued to
escalate to a 26 point bulge at the
half, 5 3-27. The second half
prolonged the debacle and only
the final buzzer ended the
slaughter at 80-62.
Utah's Redskins withstood
Stanford's charge late in the
second half and whipped the
Indians, 99-91, in Maples Pavilion
Saturday night. Trailing 78-62
with 8:34 left in the game, the
Indians led by guard Dennis
O'Neill closed the gap to eight
points 78-70 in the next two
minutes.
However, the superior
rebounding strength of Utah
asserted itself in the person of
6 '10" Jim Mahler who tipped in
three baskets in a row to put the
game out of reach. The win
evened Utah's record at 8-8 while
Stanford dropped to a 4 -11 slate.
Stanford had battled the
Redskins to a virtual draw in the
first half, trailing 4 9-48 as the
teams hit the locker room. Claude
Terry and O'Neill had paced the

Indians with 14 and 10 points. In
the important rebounding
category Stanford actually held
the advantage 25-21. Utah's
Mahler was limited to 6 while
Terry surprisingly hauled down 9.
Unfortunately, the early going
in the second half wrote the story
lor the rest of the game. Mahler
used his four inch height
advantage to its full extent.
Stanford wasn't able to block him
out and keep him off the boards
at all and, as a result, he scored 17
points and hauled down 11
rebounds.
With guard Mike Newlin's help,
Utah raced from a 59-55 lead to a
7 3-57 lead with 1 0 minutes left in
the game. From that point the
outcome was never in great doubt.
Some nifty inside shooting by
Dennis O'Neill and Clause Terry's
ball handling closed the gap, but
at the critical points Utah
matched the Indians basket for
basket.
The statistics pointed up
Stanford's crying need of a big
man to at least clog up the middle
and take a bit of the rebounding
chores off the shoulders of Mike
Michel, Pat Stevens, Chuck
Moore, and Claude Terry. In the
second half, Utah ripped Stanford
on the boards, 37-22, getting
