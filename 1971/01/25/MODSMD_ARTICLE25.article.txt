# SCIRE Paper Bank

### 
For years, students have
struggled over long hours and
sleepness nights, writing papers
for all types of college courses.
Occasionally, there have been
flashes of brilliance in the works,
or at least flowing prose that the
writer is pleased with.
But even the best papers are of
limited practical use. After the
traditional feedback from a
professor, T.A., or roommate,
student files his effort away to be
referred to rarely if ever again.
The Student Center's (SCIRE)
new paper repository hopes to
change the pattern. Working in
conjunction with interested
alumni in different fields, SCIRE
has set up a clearing house for
student wishing to send any of
their papers or research projects
to professionals outside the
traditional academic world.
The center has already
compiled a list of over 200 alumni
who have volunteered to offer

criticisms and suggest other
related research projects in a wide
range of subjects. SCIRE will send
Xerox copies of submitted papers
to appropriate volunteers, and
retain the original paper for the
student.
The alumni indicated the most
desire for student work on
environmental pollution,
population control, urban affairs,
educational innovation, and
psychological behavioral research.
Papers on all subjects are being
accepted, and other alumni are
being contacted to offer their
opinions on everything from
corporate responsibility to the
role of women in modern society.
The papers can be of any
length and do not necessarily have
to be works of earth shattering
scholastic import. Anything a
student likes and wants comment
on should be submitted to the
SCIRE office, 590 A, Old Union,
x 4504.
