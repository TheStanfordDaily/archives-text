# Nixon Outlines Domestic Reforms
## 
### 
In what may be the kick-off theme
for the 1972 campaign, President
Richard Nixon called for sweeping
domestic reforms in his State of the
Union Address including a national
health care program for the poor,
welfare reform with a guaranteed
annual income for every family with
children, and a huge, $16 -billion
revenue-sharing program between the
federal and state and local
governments.
"The time has come in America,"
the President said, "to reverse the flow
of power and resources from the states
and communities to Washington and
start power and resources flowing back
from Washington to the states and
communities, and, more important, to
the people all across America."
Nixon also recommended that the
present 12 Cabinet departments be
reduced to eight in a move aimed at
reducing "red tape" and promoting
economy. He also repeated his promise
made three weeks ago to stimulate the
nation's economy through deficit
spending and said he would propose a
series of bills "to clean up our air and
water, to combat noise and to preserve
and restore our surroundings."
Professor of political science Gabriel
Almond accepted Nixon's decision to
submit an unbalanced budget and
viewed it as a concession that past
economic policies have not worked. In
Almond's opinion, Nixon seems willing
to accept more inflation to produce
more jobs. "The political implications
of this are clear, but it is still a positive
change," Almond said.
Six Great Goals
Concrete details were lacking as the
President outlined his "six great
(domestic) goals."
The "historic in scope, bold in
concept" revenue-sharing plan, totaling
$16 billion would be funded through
$10 billion diverted from unspecified
existing programs and $6 billion of
new funding. Nixon's outline of the
program drew no response from the
legislators.
Criticism of the revenue sharing
proposal was sharp. "Anything less
than $10 billion is inadequate," said
San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto,
echoing the position of New York
Mayor John Lindsay.
Presidential hopeful Democrat
George McGovern said, "The cities and
the states need the money but it's not
going to be available as long as we are
frittering away billions on an
unjustified war and on troop
commitments beyond justification."
Prof. George L. Bach of the Business
School saw revenue sharing as a sensible
method of alleviating the financial woes
of the cities. He termed the present
reliance on the property tax as
"insufficient" and felt thai with the
present movement of the middle class
to the su burgs, cities are forced to rely
on federal money for support. He
added that the President will have a
hard time getting his plan through
Congress because of the many special
interest groups which will be unwilling

to give up control of the allocation of
these funds.
Two-Part Proposal
Should Congress pass the President's
proposal, it would operate in two
sections:
—About $5 billion would be
transferred from the federal Treasury
to state and local governments "to be
used as the states and localities see fit."
This would be all new money and no
restrictions for its use would be
established by the federal government.
—The remained of the $16 billion,
some $11 billion, would be made
available for six purposes: urban
development, rural development,
education, transportation, job training,
and law enforcement. "The states and
localities (will make) their own local
decisions on how it (the money) should
be spent," the President said.
States and localities usually must
match federal aid grants. Under Nixon's
plan, there would be no matching
requirements whatsoever. He said that
if the plan were adopted, total federal
aid to states and localities would be
increased by more than 25 percent over
the level projected for July, 1972.
Health Care
Speaking slowly and carefully, the
President gave no details of his health
care package but said its aim would be
to "insure that no American family will

be prevented from obtaining basic
medical care by inability to pay."
Administration officials indicated
that the package will include a
government-subsidized family insurance
plan, using private companies to replace
Medicaid; government-funded
catastrophe insurance to cover costs of
illnessesnot included in other plans; and
incentives in all government health
programs to stimulate formation of
prepaid group practice arrangements
known as "health maintenance
organizations."

News Analysis

The chief executive said he would
ask for more aid for medical schools
and to increase the number of doctors
and other medical personnel. He will
also request a $100 million campaign to
find a cure for cancer.
Four Departments Out
Revealing a long-expected plan sure
to draw heavy Congressional fire, the
President proposed "that the
Departments of State, Treasury,
Defense and Justice remain, but that all
the other Departments be consolidated
into four: Human Resources,
Community Development, Natural
Resources, and Economic
Development."

This plan was viewed by Professor
Almond as a "typical American
reaction". . .If you run into problems,
you reorganize and rename. Almond
noted that this change made things
look better, but probably would not
improve things too much.
According to the New York Times,
three fundamental political
assumptions underlay the President's
remarks. In the first place Nixon's
sweeping proposals depend on the
continuing support, or at least
non-opposition, to his Vietnamese
withdrawal timetable. The President
mentioned that he will explain foreign
policy matters in special State of the
World address next month
Secondly, his prediction that the
"tide of inflation has turned" must be
fulfilled along with the hope that his
new, enlarged budget will stimulate
new job openings for the increased
number of unemployed.
And finally, the Times cited the
need for the President to generate
support for his wide-ranging reforms in
a Congress dominated by Democrats. If
he succeeds, he will swing into the fall
1972 campaigns with an impressive
record. If he fails, he will have to risk a
rough battle with a much more
dangerous opponent who can win votes
by pointing to Nixon's failure to push
through any new domestic programs.

The President made a special appeal
to the nation's youth, possibly with an
eye toward the 1 972 elections when
18-year-olds will be voting for the first
time on a nationwide basis.
"We hear you and we will give you a
chance. We are going to give you a new
chance to have more to say about the
decisions that affect your future—to
participate in government—because we
are going to provide more centers of
power where what you do can make a
difference that you can see and feel in
your own life and the life of your
whole community," he said.
Dealing with several familiar themes,
the President said:
"The further away government is

from the people, the stronger
government becomes and the weaker
people become, And a nation with a
strong government and a weak people is
an empty shell."
Driving Dream's Lift
The chief executive began his
35-minute speech on an optimistic
note, saying, "In these troubled years
just past, American has been going
through a long nightmare of war and
division, of crime and inflation.
"Even more deeply, we have gone
through a long, dark night of the

American spirit. But now that night is
ending. Now we are ready for the lift
of a driving dream."
He told the new 92 nd Congress that
it has the opportunity to begin a "new
American revolution—a peaceful
revolution in which power was turned
back to the people, in which
government at all levels was refreshed
and renewed, and made truly
responsive.
That "revolution," the President
said, could be "as profound, as far
reaching, as exciting as that first
revolution almost 200 years ago."
