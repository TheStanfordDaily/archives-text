# 'Ecology Now!' But How?
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
"Ecology Now!" â€” A slogan nearly
everyone agrees on, but who can define
its meaning?
For professional biologists, the
slogan is not simply an ironic statement
of their impotence. It is also the topic
of crucial debate over the primary
emphasis and the immediate direction
of ecologists.
At a recent conference in Chicago,
Barry Commoner, a biologist from
Washington University in St. Louis,
condemned those who say the
environmental crisis in the U.S. can
only be solved by taking action to stop
population growth.
He contends that since World War II
the consumption of goods potentially
destructive to the environment has
grown far more quickly than what
would be expected from a 4 3 percent
increase in the population.
Consumption Problem
The use of electric power has
increased four times in this period and
the use of insecticides and fertilizers by
five or six. Thus Commoner views
ecology as primarily a problem of
consumption. To rid the country of
ecological abuses, he feels, people will
have to turn away from extravagant,
wasteful lifestyles.
Biologist Paul Ehrlich, who has
often singled out Commoner for

criticism, feels that Commoner is
fundamentally wrong in his
underestimation of increasing
population. While Commoner maintains
a view that a one percent increase in
pollution, Ehrlich claims the effect may
be two or three times that.
As an example, in California prime
farmland is often paved over to make
way for new housing. The farming
industry, not only must use more land
to feed the new people, it must also
employ more fertilizers on the lower
quality land that remains.
Equal Emphasis
Ehrlich feels that virtually equal
emphasis should be placed on
population and technological problems.
He admits that he titled The Population
Bomb as he did to counter-act
Commoner's view of the problem
which was widely held at the time.
Ecology should not be regarded in a
narrow fashion either, Ehrlich says.
"Mums, cockroaches and rats are
ecological problems, too. The
correction of ghetto conditions in
Detroit is neither more nor less
important than saving the Great Lakes."
Biologists do not have a monopoly
on the debate. John Gofman, author of
Population Control through Nuclear
Pollution and a member of the
Liwrence Radiation Lab at Berkeley,
has led an attack against the Atomic

Energy Commission for ignoring
problems of radioactive waste disposal.
Two Together
He also condemns those who ignore
this problem in the face of a very
serious overpopulation problem. As the
title of the book suggests, one may
provide a solution for the other.
"The wrong way to go about it is by
increasing the death function. It's the
height, of immorality when we don't
worry about cancer and leukemia."
Also at Berkeley, entymologist
Donald Dahlsten feels that in the
overview, one has to take population
into account. Nevertheless, as chairman
of the Northern California Commission
on Environmental Information, he is
mainly concerned with noise,
insecticides and fertilizers, and air
pollution.
Misquito Mistake
Research done for this committee
has shown that the use of fertilizers on
crops is not as necessary as thought
before. He also found that controlling
the spread of malarial mosquitoes
through chemicals is no longer the best
answer considering the environmental
damage that follows.
Conservation Group members here
do not appear to be struck by a
dichotomy between the adverse effects
of technology and overpopulation.
Says one member, "I don't think
they would bother to argue which is
important."
No Antagenism
Robert Mark, a graduate student in
geology, doesn't see any antagonism
between the two. In the past, people
were originally attracted to the
problem by small parts of it they could
focus on, he says. He became involved
during the fight over the dams in the
Grand Canyon.
But nowadays, "more and more
people are getting involved because
they see the general problem."
It is apparent that an ecology of the
ecology movement is emerging, in
which no one problem can be isolated
from the whole. As Ehrlich says of his
often acerbic disagreements with
Commoner, "The last thing we ought
to be doing is disagreeing with each
other."
