# What's The Plan?
## 
### 
The issue the Palo Alto voters face tomorrow is tar broader than
whether Superblock should be built or not. For entwined in the
Bryant Street Project is a question faced today by all
municipalities—how should urbanization be carried out, and what
planning is necessary before it is?
Though it won't be written on their ballots tomorrow, Palo Altans
will in effect, be deciding whether they want to continue the
residential nature of their city or to develop it into a regional center
for business and finance. And we don't think many of them realize it.
Throughout the propaganda campaign both sides have focused on
the financial aspects of the project—will the garage make money, what

editorial

is the real value of the land, what percentage of the land is left open,
and so on. The answers to these questions are beyond the knowledge
of most voters, and do not lie at the heart of matters.
What the citizens and their government should be asking is what
will come after Superblock?
The real issue facing voters is whether or not to further develop
downtown Palo Alto. The questions involved here have not yet been
answered.
•How will development affect the low-moderate income housing
shortage in Palo Alto? The already critical shortage of housing is
forcing minorities out of the city and uping rents to exorbitant levels.
How will increased traffic be handled on streets already packed far
beyond their capacity? Answers such as Willow Expressway
compound the problems by destroying housing and increasing
pollution.
•What effect would a concentration of business in Palo Alto have on
communities throughout the mid-peninsula? The question of the
future consequences of development throughout the area has been
almost totally ignored by Palo Altans.
•If this project isn't built, where and how will further economic
development of the Bay Area be carried out? Will the defeat of
Superblock only add to urban sprawl? And if so, is that good or bad?
These are the questions which have not been answered. Palo Alto
faces the prospect of stumbling step-by-step, high-rise by high-rise,
superblock by superblock into increased urbanization.
Our point is not that the Bryant Street and the urbanization that
will follow it are bad. It is rather, that the issue has not been
confronted by the City Council and the developers. The voters should
realize this and reject the project until they are presented with a
coherent plan for the future development of Palo Alto.
The supporters of Superblock have not told the voters what is to
follow and until they have, they can not win their case.

development of the Bay Area be carried out? Will the defeat of
Superblock only add to urban sprawl? And if so, is that good or bad?
These are the questions which have not been answered. Palo Alto
faces the prospect of stumbling step-by-step, high-rise by high-rise,
superblock by superblock into increased urbanization.
Our point is not that the Bryant Street and the urbanization that
will follow it are bad. It is rather, that the issue has not been
confronted by the City Council and the developers. The voters should
realize this and reject the project until they are presented with a
coherent plan for the future development of Palo Alto.
The supporters of Superblock have not told the voters what is to
follow and until they have, they can not win their case.
