# SUPERBLOCK FORUM
## In A Nutshell 
### 
The Bryant Street Project, also
known as Super block, is a proposed
downtown development which has
been put before Palo Alto voters for
approval at a special election
tomorrow.
The project includes:
1) Two 11-story office towers, 15 0
feet tall, with 1 13,000 square feet of
floor space in each tower, 96,000
square feet of it rentable.
2) A separate two-story commercial
building, with 1 0,000 square feet.
3) A 9,200 square foot extension of
the ground floor of one of the towers
to house a new Bank of America
branch office, which would be
relocated from University Avenue and
Ramona streets.
4 ) A three-level underground parking
garage, with 1,194 spaces and entrance
from the mid-blocks of Florence and
Ramona streets.
5 ) A 2-acre grass and walk-way open
area that would blend in with Cogswell
Plaza at Lytton Avenue and Ramona.
Cogswell Plaza will be left as is.
Superblock will cost $12 million, of
which $4 million will go for the
underground garage. Of the $4 million
$3,140,000 will be funded through
30-year bonds totaling $3,540 ,000
(with $400,000 included to make early
payments until parking revenue comes
in). Payments will be paid by garage
revenues and two types of assessments
on downtown buildings and land,
guaranteed by the city.

The project also includes a 5500,000
contribution to a $997,000
beautification project for the entire
downtown commercial area.
The 3-acre site is bounded by
University, Ramona, Lytton and
Florence, Bryant Street would be
closed between University and Lytton
to become part of the development.
Buildings fronting on University
Avenue would be left except for the
former Clothes Closet store and a
sewing machine store owned by the
Bank of America.
The proposition requires a majority
of the votes cast in order to pass, and
the results of the election are binding
on the City Council.
The Proposition reads as follows:
Shall the Bryant Street Project, as
defined in Resolution No. 4390 calling
the election at which this proposition is
submitted, and Ordinance No. 258 9
changing the zoning therefore, both
adopted November 9, 1970, be
approved, and shall the proposed
agreement for the accomplishment of
the Bryant Street Project, as identified
in said Resolution No. 4390 calling said
election, be executed by the City of
Palo Alto?
A vote FOR means that you approve
1) the implementation of the Bryant
Street Project, 2) the zoning change, 3)
the agreement of the City of Palo Alto,
the City Parking Authority, and the
developer.
A vote AGAINST means that you
disapprove of these measures.
