# Opinion Opposing Superblock
## go to the polls Vote No To Over-Development 
### 
David w. Jones

Palo Alto voters will go to the polls
tomorrow to decide a local
zoning/development issue with
significant impact for the
mid-Peninsula's future environmental
quality: Superblock—yes or no?
Tomorrow's election is a special
election: an event which has
traditionally meant low voter turnouts
of 20 to 4 0 percent of the registered
voters. An informed turn-out of
off-campus student and faculty voters
could prove critical to the election's
outcome.
Immediately at issue is whether the
City of Palo Alto will: 1) Sell 80,000
square feet of downtown property to
the private development company of
Cornish and Carey for the construction
of two 11-story office buildings and a
1 200 space underground parking
facility; and then, 2) purchase from the
developer 36 percent of the stalls in the
completed garage structure at a cost of
$3.14 million.
Significantly absent from the public
debate has been a discussion of the
impact of the project upon an area
wider than the essentially fictional
political jurisdiction that is the
municipal incorporation of Palo Alto.
Public debate has largely centered on
the costs and benefits that will accrue
to the taxpayers of Palo Alto and its
downtown commercial property
owners. Every bit as critical, but largely
ignored in the policy debate are
questions of a regional nature:
1) Impact on air pollution and open
space.
2) Impace on housing needs.
3) Impact on transportation needs.
4) Impact on the housing,
education, property value, and tax base
patterns that have ghettoized minority
groups in East Palo Alto, Bellehaven
and Mountain View.
I will argue that the proposed
development should be Defeated for
much the same reasons that eight of
Palo Alto's ardently develop
ment-minded councilmen have urged
that it be passed: the concentration of
commercial development in the interest
of increased property and sales tax
base.
The argument against Superblock
requires an understanding of the
complex interaction between
employment, income level, housing,
transportation and tax base. That
interaction is not likely to lead to
either environmental health or a
community that bears resemblance to a
"people place" as long as municipalities
are competing tooth and nail for added
tax revenues that come from industrial
and commercial development. A quick
glance at Palo Alto's General Plan lets
you know that Menlo Park and
Mountain View and Sunnyvale are THE
EMI,M tne> are competing to attract

the stores and industries and office
centers that are supposed to pay the
taxes for OUR children's schools.
A more humane and rational system
would work to balance land uses in the
hopes of minimizing traffic congestion
and the attendant air pollution,
minimizing concrete and asphalt,
minimizing imbalance between the
location of housing and employment,
minimizing the isolation of black and
brown people in areas with low-quality
housing and low quality schooling. A
humane system would try to minimize
municipal competition to maximize
open space, play areas, cultural and
racial diversity—a whole series of goals
that conceive of the city as a place for
people to mingle and interact, offering
both community and privacy as equal
options.
But that option would not be likely
to suit either the developer or the
holders of large tracts of land for
commercial speculation. They are
served by the present competitive
practice of "over-zoning," which
depresses land costs and maximized
development sprawl.
Let us now look at the long-run
costs of the Superblock proposal. For
lack of a better word, I'll call it the
multiplier effect: more population,
more roads, more pollution, more stress
on the low income housing market,
more ghettoizing, more education and
welfare problems, requiring more taxes
to get more revenue—and therefore,

more development.
First, Air Pollution. The Superblock
will add between 800 and 1200 new
employees to the mid-peninsula,
probably the higher estimate because
the development is expected to attract
new businesses in search of office
space. Given the tight housing market,
expecting smog-producing commutes of
up to 15 miles. Only 14 percent of the
employees of a company which located
in Palo Alto 15 years ago live in the
city; the housing situation is worse
now, not better.
Second, transportation. New
development mandates new highways
to carry the increased load. Thus, the
1969 De Leuw & Cather
Transportation Planning Program
reports that, "Willow Freeway is
necessary for an orderly development
of the downtown neighborhood, and to
carry through traffic around the
downtown neighborhood." The
Expressway means in turn, that,
"Improved roadway connections at
Pasteur Drive, El Camino Real, Alma,
and Middlefield Road will be necessary
for ramps, grade separations and other
interchange features." More concrete,
more asphalt and more taxes.
Third, housing. The new superblock
employees will need housing that is
unavailable in Palo Alto. So look to
development pressures on the foothills
and other open land to the south. To
provide adequate schools for the
children of those employees, other

municipalities will have to catch up in
the race for commercial development
tax revenue. At the same time, housing
values will be demand-inflated at the
expense of low income families,
particularly the minority people
already locked into substandard
housing and education east of
Bayshore.
At the regional level, the project is
little short of an invitation to
wall-to-wall development.
But even in the narrow interests of
Palo Alto residents, the project is, as its
opponents have said, a white elephant.
The parking garage is expected to
lose money—slo2,ooo annually by the
city's own optimistic estimate.
Add in the Willow Expressway that
becomes an imperative—more land off
the tax roles.
Add in the fact that the city does
not know at what point the additional
costs in city services will exceed the
return in tax revenues!
Add in the localized traffic
congestion on University and Lytton
Avenues.
Add in the change in ambiance of
Cogswell Park—now a haven for the
very old—with eleven-story surveillance.
Add it up, to to the polls and vote a
resounding NO to over-development.

of 20 to 4 0 percent of the registered
voters. An informed turn-out of
off-campus student and faculty voters
could prove critical to the election's
outcome.
Immediately at issue is whether the
City of Palo Alto will: 1) Sell 80,000
square feet of downtown property to
the private development company of
Cornish and Carey for the construction
of two 11-story office buildings and a
1 200 space underground parking
facility; and then, 2) purchase from the
developer 36 percent of the stalls in the
completed garage structure at a cost of
$3.14 million.
Significantly absent from the public
debate has been a discussion of the
impact of the project upon an area
wider than the essentially fictional
political jurisdiction that is the
municipal incorporation of Palo Alto.
Public debate has largely centered on
the costs and benefits that will accrue
to the taxpayers of Palo Alto and its
downtown commercial property
owners. Every bit as critical, but largely
ignored in the policy debate are
questions of a regional nature:
1) Impact on air pollution and open
space.
2) Impace on housing needs.
3) Impact on transportation needs.
4) Impact on the housing,
education, property value, and tax base
patterns that have ghettoized minority
groups in East Palo Alto, Bellehaven
and Mountain View.
I will argue that the proposed
development should be Defeated for
much the same reasons that eight of
Palo Alto's ardently develop
ment-minded councilmen have urged
that it be passed: the concentration of
commercial development in the interest
of increased property and sales tax
base.
The argument against Superblock
requires an understanding of the
complex interaction between
employment, income level, housing,
transportation and tax base. That
interaction is not likely to lead to
either environmental health or a
community that bears resemblance to a
"people place" as long as municipalities
are competing tooth and nail for added
tax revenues that come from industrial
and commercial development. A quick
glance at Palo Alto's General Plan lets
you know that Menlo Park and
Mountain View and Sunnyvale are THE
EMI,M tne> are competing to attract

the stores and industries and office
centers that are supposed to pay the
taxes for OUR children's schools.
A more humane and rational system
would work to balance land uses in the
hopes of minimizing traffic congestion
and the attendant air pollution,
minimizing concrete and asphalt,
minimizing imbalance between the
location of housing and employment,
minimizing the isolation of black and
brown people in areas with low-quality
housing and low quality schooling. A
humane system would try to minimize
municipal competition to maximize
open space, play areas, cultural and
racial diversity—a whole series of goals
that conceive of the city as a place for
people to mingle and interact, offering
both community and privacy as equal
options.
But that option would not be likely
to suit either the developer or the
holders of large tracts of land for
commercial speculation. They are
served by the present competitive
practice of "over-zoning," which
depresses land costs and maximized
development sprawl.
Let us now look at the long-run
costs of the Superblock proposal. For
lack of a better word, I'll call it the
multiplier effect: more population,
more roads, more pollution, more stress
on the low income housing market,
more ghettoizing, more education and
welfare problems, requiring more taxes
to get more revenue—and therefore,

more development.
First, Air Pollution. The Superblock
will add between 800 and 1200 new
employees to the mid-peninsula,
probably the higher estimate because
the development is expected to attract
new businesses in search of office
space. Given the tight housing market,
expecting smog-producing commutes of
up to 15 miles. Only 14 percent of the
employees of a company which located
in Palo Alto 15 years ago live in the
city; the housing situation is worse
now, not better.
Second, transportation. New
development mandates new highways
to carry the increased load. Thus, the
1969 De Leuw & Cather
Transportation Planning Program
reports that, "Willow Freeway is
necessary for an orderly development
of the downtown neighborhood, and to
carry through traffic around the
downtown neighborhood." The
Expressway means in turn, that,
"Improved roadway connections at
Pasteur Drive, El Camino Real, Alma,
and Middlefield Road will be necessary
for ramps, grade separations and other
interchange features." More concrete,
more asphalt and more taxes.
Third, housing. The new superblock
employees will need housing that is
unavailable in Palo Alto. So look to
development pressures on the foothills
and other open land to the south. To
provide adequate schools for the
children of those employees, other

municipalities will have to catch up in
the race for commercial development
tax revenue. At the same time, housing
values will be demand-inflated at the
expense of low income families,
particularly the minority people
already locked into substandard
housing and education east of
Bayshore.
At the regional level, the project is
little short of an invitation to
wall-to-wall development.
But even in the narrow interests of
Palo Alto residents, the project is, as its
opponents have said, a white elephant.
The parking garage is expected to
lose money—slo2,ooo annually by the
city's own optimistic estimate.
Add in the Willow Expressway that
becomes an imperative—more land off
the tax roles.
Add in the fact that the city does
not know at what point the additional
costs in city services will exceed the
return in tax revenues!
Add in the localized traffic
congestion on University and Lytton
Avenues.
Add in the change in ambiance of
Cogswell Park—now a haven for the
very old—with eleven-story surveillance.
Add it up, to to the polls and vote a
resounding NO to over-development.

Cornish and Carey for the construction
of two 11-story office buildings and a
1 200 space underground parking
facility; and then, 2) purchase from the
developer 36 percent of the stalls in the
completed garage structure at a cost of
$3.14 million.
Significantly absent from the public
debate has been a discussion of the
impact of the project upon an area
wider than the essentially fictional
political jurisdiction that is the
municipal incorporation of Palo Alto.
Public debate has largely centered on
the costs and benefits that will accrue
to the taxpayers of Palo Alto and its
downtown commercial property
owners. Every bit as critical, but largely
ignored in the policy debate are
questions of a regional nature:
1) Impact on air pollution and open
space.
2) Impace on housing needs.
3) Impact on transportation needs.
4) Impact on the housing,
education, property value, and tax base
patterns that have ghettoized minority
groups in East Palo Alto, Bellehaven
and Mountain View.
I will argue that the proposed
development should be Defeated for
much the same reasons that eight of
Palo Alto's ardently develop
ment-minded councilmen have urged
that it be passed: the concentration of
commercial development in the interest
of increased property and sales tax
base.
The argument against Superblock
requires an understanding of the
complex interaction between
employment, income level, housing,
transportation and tax base. That
interaction is not likely to lead to
either environmental health or a
community that bears resemblance to a
"people place" as long as municipalities
are competing tooth and nail for added
tax revenues that come from industrial
and commercial development. A quick
glance at Palo Alto's General Plan lets
you know that Menlo Park and
Mountain View and Sunnyvale are THE
EMI,M tne> are competing to attract

the stores and industries and office
centers that are supposed to pay the
taxes for OUR children's schools.
A more humane and rational system
would work to balance land uses in the
hopes of minimizing traffic congestion
and the attendant air pollution,
minimizing concrete and asphalt,
minimizing imbalance between the
location of housing and employment,
minimizing the isolation of black and
brown people in areas with low-quality
housing and low quality schooling. A
humane system would try to minimize
municipal competition to maximize
open space, play areas, cultural and
racial diversity—a whole series of goals
that conceive of the city as a place for
people to mingle and interact, offering
both community and privacy as equal
options.
But that option would not be likely
to suit either the developer or the
holders of large tracts of land for
commercial speculation. They are
served by the present competitive
practice of "over-zoning," which
depresses land costs and maximized
development sprawl.
Let us now look at the long-run
costs of the Superblock proposal. For
lack of a better word, I'll call it the
multiplier effect: more population,
more roads, more pollution, more stress
on the low income housing market,
more ghettoizing, more education and
welfare problems, requiring more taxes
to get more revenue—and therefore,

more development.
First, Air Pollution. The Superblock
will add between 800 and 1200 new
employees to the mid-peninsula,
probably the higher estimate because
the development is expected to attract
new businesses in search of office
space. Given the tight housing market,
expecting smog-producing commutes of
up to 15 miles. Only 14 percent of the
employees of a company which located
in Palo Alto 15 years ago live in the
city; the housing situation is worse
now, not better.
Second, transportation. New
development mandates new highways
to carry the increased load. Thus, the
1969 De Leuw & Cather
Transportation Planning Program
reports that, "Willow Freeway is
necessary for an orderly development
of the downtown neighborhood, and to
carry through traffic around the
downtown neighborhood." The
Expressway means in turn, that,
"Improved roadway connections at
Pasteur Drive, El Camino Real, Alma,
and Middlefield Road will be necessary
for ramps, grade separations and other
interchange features." More concrete,
more asphalt and more taxes.
Third, housing. The new superblock
employees will need housing that is
unavailable in Palo Alto. So look to
development pressures on the foothills
and other open land to the south. To
provide adequate schools for the
children of those employees, other

municipalities will have to catch up in
the race for commercial development
tax revenue. At the same time, housing
values will be demand-inflated at the
expense of low income families,
particularly the minority people
already locked into substandard
housing and education east of
Bayshore.
At the regional level, the project is
little short of an invitation to
wall-to-wall development.
But even in the narrow interests of
Palo Alto residents, the project is, as its
opponents have said, a white elephant.
The parking garage is expected to
lose money—slo2,ooo annually by the
city's own optimistic estimate.
Add in the Willow Expressway that
becomes an imperative—more land off
the tax roles.
Add in the fact that the city does
not know at what point the additional
costs in city services will exceed the
return in tax revenues!
Add in the localized traffic
congestion on University and Lytton
Avenues.
Add in the change in ambiance of
Cogswell Park—now a haven for the
very old—with eleven-story surveillance.
Add it up, to to the polls and vote a
resounding NO to over-development.

Palo Alto voters will go to the polls
tomorrow to decide a local
zoning/development issue with
significant impact for the
mid-Peninsula's future environmental
quality: Superblock—yes or no?
Tomorrow's election is a special
election: an event which has

voters. An informed turn-out of
off-campus student and faculty voters
could prove critical to the election's
outcome.
Immediately at issue is whether the
City of Palo Alto will: 1) Sell 80,000
square feet of downtown property to
