# Committee Cites Many Problems
## 
### RICHARD ROSENBAUM 
Will the proposed Bryant Street Project "enhance the
quality of life" for all the people of Palo Alto, as its
proponents claim? Or will it intensify some of the most
pressing problems facing our citizenry?
The following facts would seem to lead to but one
conclusion:
1. Without seeking competitive bids, the City has
agreed to sell land to a private developer at 2/3 of its
appraised value.
2. The City has agreed to buy and operate a 1 200 stall
underground garage which is guaranteed to lose money.
The City staff has stated that even if this garage is 100%
occupied, it will lose over $100,000 a year. (The two
existing underground garages in downtown Palo Alto - one
under the Palo Alto Office Center, the other under the
new City Hall - are only 5 0% occupied.
3. The downtown property owners and merchants are
being assessed a considerable amount to help cover the
deficit on this underground garage. Their employees and
customers are going to have to pay nearly twice as much
as they do now to park their cars. (The City staff has
based the assessment rates on the proposed near doubling
of parking rates in the downtown which is necessary to
make the higher rates in the Superblock garage
competitive with other parking facilities.)
4. The Superblock is part of a trend toward converting

downtown to a high-rise regional office center. Palo Alto
does not have the necessary transportation facilities to
serve such development: 1) Our narrow, already congested
downtown streets cannot accommodate the amount of
traffic generated by this kind of intensive development; 2)
Mass transit is needed to service high-density commercial
areas.
5. There is a serious housing shortage in Palo Alto. The
Superblock will intensify the pressure on the housing
market.
fi. There has never been an economic analysis of the
costs of converting downtown Palo Alto to a high-rise
commercial area. New roads, utilities, and sewers must be
provided by the public. The costs of these public facilities,
to the taxpayer, might well exceed the taxes collected on
the commercial development.
7. The City owns two acres (63%) of the proposed site.
To use public land to intensify the problems we face is
not in the public interest.
Beyond all these considerations, there is the basic
question of what type of city we want Palo Alto to be.
Let's put our energies and imagination toward
encouraging our City to use its power and credit to more
constructive use — solving the critical problems of its
citizens.

provided by the public. The costs of these public facilities,
to the taxpayer, might well exceed the taxes collected on
the commercial development.

Will the proposed Bryant Street Project "enhance the
quality of life" for all the people of Palo Alto, as its
proponents claim? Or will it intensify some of the most
pressing problems facing our citizenry?
The following facts would seem to lead to but one
conclusion:
1. Without seeking competitive bids, the City has
agreed to sell land to a private developer at 2/3 of its
appraised value.
2. The City has agreed to buy and operate a 1 200 stall
underground garage which is guaranteed to lose money.
The City staff has stated that even if this garage is 100%
occupied, it will lose over $100,000 a year. (The two
existing underground garages in downtown Palo Alto - one
under the Palo Alto Office Center, the other under the
new City Hall - are only 5 0% occupied.
3. The downtown property owners and merchants are
being assessed a considerable amount to help cover the
deficit on this underground garage. Their employees and
customers are going to have to pay nearly twice as much
as they do now to park their cars. (The City staff has
based the assessment rates on the proposed near doubling
of parking rates in the downtown which is necessary to
make the higher rates in the Superblock garage
competitive with other parking facilities.)
4. The Superblock is part of a trend toward converting

downtown to a high-rise regional office center. Palo Alto
does not have the necessary transportation facilities to
serve such development: 1) Our narrow, already congested
downtown streets cannot accommodate the amount of
traffic generated by this kind of intensive development; 2)
Mass transit is needed to service high-density commercial
areas.
5. There is a serious housing shortage in Palo Alto. The
Superblock will intensify the pressure on the housing
market.
