# PATU Analysis Finds Faults With Project
## 
### JEREMY FOGEL 
Tomorrow the people of Palo Alto
will be voting on the Bryant Street
Project. The "Superblock" is a giant
financial center (two eleven-story
towers, a Bank of America building,
stores and an underground garage larger
than the Union Square garage in San
Francisco) planned along University
Avenue in downtown Palo . Proponents
of the Superblock argue that the
project will revitalize the downtown
area, create new jobs, and most
important, insure responsible urban
growth at no cost to the taxpayer. This
position is totally misleading. While a
full analysis of the myriad faults of the
project is impossible here, these are the
main problems:
1. The way to revitalize a
community is not to remove its tenant
housing, choke its streets with traffic,
and make its businesses either too
expensive or too inaccessible for most
people to afford. Yet the Bryant Street
Project would have a disastrous effect
on Palo Alto's already overburdened
low- to moderate-income housing
market by bringing more than a
thousand new white collar workers into
the area, thus increasing demand both
in terms of numbers and wage level and
raising rents as a result of higher land
values and property taxes. The garage
would be a bottleneck of frightful
proportionsâ€”already downtown streets
in Palo Alto are virtually impassible at
times during the day. Business would
lose more from the effects of increased
downtown traffic and the cost of
necessary street improvements than it
would gain from new development.
Clearly the only people who will
benefit from the Superblock are the
developers, the Bank of America, and

those who hope to make Palo Alto the
hub of a major financial-industrial
complex during the next few years.
2. The Bryant Street Project is a
classic example of the misuse of
governmental authority. Democratic
government exists, at least in theory,
not to serve those in authority but to
serve people. From the beginning, the
Superblock has been the bastard child
of profit-seeking developers and their
friends the City Council (in many
cases the same people or their business
partners).
The current election is being held in
January, at an extra cost of $10,000,
rather than in May when the regular
municipal election will be held, because
the developer informed the Council
that the project's financial backing
would be jeopardized if a decision were
not made by January, and because the
Council wanted to avoid the
embarrassment of a citizen-initiated
referendum in May. There is no way to
view this unholy alliance of "public
vision and private enterprise" as
anything other than an expression of
contempt for the people of Palo Alto,
who for the most part have no use for
Superblock and in many cases will
suffer directly because of it.
The Palo Alto Tenants' Union is
committed to defending the right of
people of all incomes and all races to
live in Palo Alto. We view the Bryant
Street Project as a grave threat to that
commitment, but we are hopeful of
defeating it tomorrow. We urge all Palo
Alto voters in the Stanford community
to vote NO on Superblock.
