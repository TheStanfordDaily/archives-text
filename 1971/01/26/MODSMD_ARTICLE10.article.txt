# Film Tyros Make American Shocker
## 
### JUDITH STRASSER 
Last fall, Bay area activist and
former Stanford grad student
Steve Weissman asked three
friends to make a film to
accompany a speech he planned
to give at a conference in Geneva.
The friends, Stanford psychology
professor George Kaplan, Larry
Christiani, and Sanda Kroopf, had
never made a film. Weissman
outlined his ideas for the speech,
and the neophyte filmmakers set
to work.
Early this month I saw
"Babylon," which had been
vaguely described to me as an
ecology movie. I went to the
screening prepared to see puffing
smokestacks and oil-stained
beaches, expertly presented.
My preconceptions were
severely limited. The film is a
shocker. It is not an ecology film.
It is a movie about
overdevelopment, seen through
the eyes of artists reared in an
affluent society. All the trite
images are included, but the film
avoids triteness. The soundtrack, a
masterful mixture of electronic
and rock music and sound effects,
sweeps the listener through the
eight minute film with relentless
force.
"Babylon" makes no overt
political statement; it is simply a
short and angry' vision of the
United States. Reaction in
Geneva, where Weissman scrapped
his speech and showed only the
film to people from
underdeveloped Latin America
and overdeveloped Europe, was
mixed. Everyone found it moving.
"Babylon" is not a manifesto
or a call to action. "Babylon" is
not artistically revolutionary.
But unlike Latin Americans,

we in the United States are not in
the midst of revolution. We are
only beginning to realize the
implications of our massively
wasteful, superficially affluent
society. We can understand why
our white artists do not yet
produce revolutionary films.
Few American movies attempt
to present an honest picture of
this country. Hollywood offers us
"Brewster McCloud" and an
endless stream of campus
"revolutionaries," expensive
actings-out of infantile fantasies.
Andy Warhol and his ilk have
opted out, artistically and
politically.
"Babylon" is not a revolution,
or a picture of a revolution. But it
is an honest picture, and it may
help explain to present-day
skeptics and future historians why
some Americans call for
revolution.

force.
"Babylon" makes no overt
political statement; it is simply a
short and angry' vision of the
United States. Reaction in
Geneva, where Weissman scrapped
his speech and showed only the
film to people from
underdeveloped Latin America
and overdeveloped Europe, was
mixed. Everyone found it moving.
"Babylon" is not a manifesto
or a call to action. "Babylon" is
not artistically revolutionary.
But unlike Latin Americans,

we in the United States are not in
the midst of revolution. We are
only beginning to realize the
implications of our massively
wasteful, superficially affluent
society. We can understand why
our white artists do not yet
produce revolutionary films.
Few American movies attempt
to present an honest picture of
this country. Hollywood offers us
"Brewster McCloud" and an
endless stream of campus
"revolutionaries," expensive
actings-out of infantile fantasies.
Andy Warhol and his ilk have
opted out, artistically and
politically.
"Babylon" is not a revolution,
or a picture of a revolution. But it
is an honest picture, and it may
help explain to present-day
skeptics and future historians why
some Americans call for
revolution.

Last fall, Bay area activist and
former Stanford grad student
Steve Weissman asked three
friends to make a film to
accompany a speech he planned
to give at a conference in Geneva.
The friends, Stanford psychology
professor George Kaplan, Larry
Christiani, and Sanda Kroopf, had
never made a film. Weissman
outlined his ideas for the speech,
and the neophyte filmmakers set
to work.
Early this month I saw
"Babylon," which had been
vaguely described to me as an
ecology movie. I went to the
screening prepared to see puffing
smokestacks and oil-stained
beaches, expertly presented.
My preconceptions were
severely limited. The film is a
shocker. It is not an ecology film.
It is a movie about
overdevelopment, seen through
the eyes of artists reared in an
affluent society. All the trite
images are included, but the film
avoids triteness. The soundtrack, a
masterful mixture of electronic
and rock music and sound effects,
sweeps the listener through the
eight minute film with relentless
force.
