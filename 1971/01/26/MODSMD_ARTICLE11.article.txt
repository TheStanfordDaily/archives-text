No, the revolution hasn't come
quite yet. But Dennis Hopper,
director and star of "Easy Rider,"
is releasing a new movie called
"American Drean;or," and who
knows what he's dreaming about?
The movie, which was filmed
from an outline rather than a
script, sets up situations relating
to Hopper and "lets them explode

in front of the cameras,"
according to co-director Lawrence
Schiller. The film treats all aspects
of Hopper's existence from his art
to his sex life.
"Dreamer" is designed for
direct distribution on national
campuses, ignoring established
movie houses.
