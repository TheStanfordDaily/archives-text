# Late Knight Place To Be

### DANIEL L. BRENNER 
The late night television talk
show, once a showcase for
starry-eyed starlets, has become
an electronic soap-box for the
ambitious politician. There, he
can confront the viewer with a
professional sales pitch on
anything from welfare reform to
Martha Mitchell, sure of asylum
from the F.C.C.'s equal time
provisions.
In the past year for example,
late night viewers have sat through
the canned witticisms of Spiro
Agnew. John Lindsay, Ronald
Reagan and other politicians who
have something to sell. And when
these entrepreneurs of politics use
votes as their means of commerce,
how they sell becomes the focus
of public scrutiny.
The influence of these
programs in politics takes many
forms. In 1968, the executive
producer of the "Nixon's the
One" packages and the spot
announcements for the
Nixon-Agnew team was the
director of The Mike Douglas
Show. His skill in putting pizazz
in the poeple-want-to-know
format was instrumental in
presenting Nixon in a new, more
human form, suitable for greater
consumption.
Hosts themselves can take a
part in the political nature of their
program. Pat Boone, the host of
his own variety-conversation
program, has been for a long time
the symbol of the younger
conservative faction of the
California Republican Party. He
has been on many spot
commercials for the conservative
cause. One can only imagine the
type of blah-blah questioning that
took place when a George Murphy

or John Tower came on for a
chitchat.
Worse than host partiality is
host incapacity. For example,
what is a Joey Bishop's or a Betsy
Palmer's ability to stop a
politician from making his
program into free political air
time? The politician is often more
aware of the subtler techniques of
the selective questionning process
than his genial host. A
professional journalist is necessary
not a one-time singer or quiz show
panelist, to prevent a politician
from running away with the show.
The politician can also use
celebrity association to promote
his personal image. For example,
when some senator delivers his
syrupy praise about a recent John
Wayne picture, he not only
flatters Wayne, but also implicity
shares the "star's" super-patriotic
values. This technique is nothing
new to politics but what is new is
that the conversation variety
format makes it easier for a
politician to get himself into this
situation.
Many politicians, however,
refuse to appear on these
programs unless they can appear
alone, then get off stage so that
the regular line-up of celebrities
can carry on with their trivia. This
also permits these politicians to
maneuver the questions without
the possible challenge of one of
the other guests, who might want
to ask an unexpected question.
It is unfair to say that all of
these programs carry on these
types of practices all the time. In
fact, many politicians will not
participate in shows that leave the
questioning exclusively to a singer
or character actor.
But as long as the conversation

variety host remains an uncritical
sieve or a simple sponge when
asking questions of national
scope, the obscurity between
show business and politics will
prevail. So it is possible for a
politician to just happen to be
able to spout off all sorts of
specific facts about a subject
when the host just happens to
bring up the subject.
The politician gains just one
more vehicle by which he can
escape honest journalistic
confrontation whiie posing as a
candid, well-informed public
servant for the public eye.
