# Court Refuses To Stop Suit Against P.A.Cops
## 
### 
A slight temporary legal victory was
won by lawyers for eight local radicals
and liberals involved in a protest suit
against alleged harrassment by the Palo
Alto Police special intelligence unit,
often called the "Red Squad."
In asking lawyers for the group to
clarify one of their complaints, Judge
Robert 11. Schnacke denied two other
motions filed against the suit by
lawyers for the city government and
the police's insurance company. These
two motions asked that the judge
dismiss the case and, secondly, to strike
all references to the Red Squad, the
name given to the unit allegedly on
special assignment to keep track of
radical activities in Palo Alto and on
campus.
However, according to John Naff,
legal assistant to Judge Schnacke, the
decision on the two -ountercharges was
not made directly on their "merits."
Thus lawyers for the city may re-file
them for reconsideration after the

plaintiff's re-submit their amended
complaint.
The suit stems from complaints over
the police's close scrutiny of leftist
political activity and examples cited
range from übiquitous photographers at
rallies and demonstrations to an
incident of mating allegedly done by
plainclothes officers in an unmarked
car.
The suit was filed on June 22, 1 970
by Art Busse, radical and former
student here; Steven Gayle, former
member of the Palo Alto Youth
Advisory Council; Joe Hardegree,
radical and staff member of the United
Campus Ministry here; John Dolly and
Tim Gadus, both radicals and members
of Venceremos; Harriet Besser, Law
School secretary and parent of a high
school student; and Dave Jones, Jr.,
and Douglas Mattern both active in
liberal politics on campus. Representing
the group is Jim Wolpman of the Law
Commune.


NLW PROVOST—Former vice president in charge of research, Bill Miller, is
Stanford's new provost. Miller was appointed to the position which was vacated
when Richard Lyman moved up to the president's office. One of the questions
facing him is how much of a role he will assume in future campus disruptions.
