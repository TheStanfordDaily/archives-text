Manson Family Guilty
LOS ANGELES—CharIes Manson, shaggy leader of a
cult-like clan of hippie types, was convicted Monday
of first-degree murder and conspiracy along with
three women followers in the savage slayings of
actress Sharon Tate and six others.
The state said it will ask the death penalty for all.
The defendants, who staged wild outbursts during
their seven-month trial, sat passively as verdicts were
returned on the 27 counts against them.
After jurors were polled, Manson muttered
audibly, referring to them: "I think they're all
guilty." After the verdicts were all in, he shouted at
the judge: "We're still not allowed to put on a
defense. You won't outlive that, old man."
The jury of seven men and five women, who had
deliberated 12 hours and 40 minutes since receiving
the case Jan. 15 , was ordered to return to court at 9
a.m. Thursday for the penalty phase of the trial. They
will continue to be sequestered.
The prosecutor said he has about 5 0 witnesses
ready for the penalty trial. The defense has said it will
put on a case as long or longer than the state's seeking
life imprisonment instead of the death penalty on a
contention there still is doubt as to guilt.
Phnom Penh Attacked
PHNOM PENH — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
soldiers launched attacks Monday night against the
defense perimeter of Phnom Penh, tense Cambodian
capital under dusk to-dawn curfew because of an
enemy war of terror spreading in the streets.
Capt. Chhang Song, a Cambodian high command
spokesman, said the major battle was fought at the
village of Phnom Prey Khiev, 2 4 miles northwest of
the capital, where an enemy force of 5 00 struck half

an hour after darkness. The other battles were at
Saant, 18 miles south of the capital, and Lovea Sar
Kandal, 28 miles to the southeast.
All three enemy assaults were driven back by air
strikes at nidnight, he said.
The curfew order in Phnom Penh followed an
attempt to bomb the South Vietnamese Embassy on
a main boulevard and new attacks on the city's outer
edges and the airport, already severely damaged by an
enemy raid last Friday.
In Saigon, the South Vietnamese government
proposed Tuesday that it and North Vietnam release
immediately all sick and wounded prisoners of war,
including American airmen held in the North.
North Vietnam has consistently refused to
negotiate a prisoner exchange without a definite
schedule for complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops.
A Viet Cong cease-fire went into effect in South
Vietnam for the four day Tet lunar new year but the
holiday is not observed in Cambodia except by
minority populations of Vietnamese and Chinese.
Saigon headquarters said the Viet Cong violated
the cease-fire soon after it took effect with two
attacks that killed six South Vietnamese and
wounded 22. The U.S. Command reported no actions
against American units in the first hours of the enemy
standdown.
Southern Crossing
SACRAMENTO — A San Francisco Bay Area
legislator has introduced the year's third bill to delay
construction of the controversial Southern Crossing
bridge over the bay.
Sen. Alfred Alquist on Monday proposed a ban on
construction until the region's Metropolitan
Transportation Commission sends its report on the
plan to the legislature in January 1973.

"A thorough re-evaluation of the decision to build
this bridge is absolutely necessary," the San JOse
Democrat said. He introduced a similar bill last year,
but it was killed in the Assembly Transportation
Committee.
Ugandan President Out
KAMPALA, Uganda — Army dissidents claimed the
overthrow of President Milton Obote Monday, as he
was heading home from the Common-wealth summit
in Singapore, and warned other governments not to
interfere.
A few hours after Radio Uganda announced the
takeover, Obote arrived in nearby Nairobi, Kenya,
and associates said he had established radio contact
with Kampala.
"The army takes over power and warns all foreign
countries to keep noses out of Uganda's internal
affairs," said the Uganda broadcast. It made the
victory claim after 1 2 hours of fighting with a rival
faction of the armed forces in which an
undertermined number of persons were reported
killed.
Venue Rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court guaranteed all
criminal defendants Monday the right to seek a trial
in a community that is not prejudiced against them.
The guarantee came in an 8-1 decision that upset
the conviction of the Rev. James E. Groppi for
resisting arrest during a civil rights march in
Milwaukee in 1 9 67.
The priest had been active in the civil rights
movement, and he contended the jury at his trial
would reflect community prejudice against him.

of first-degree murder and conspiracy along with
three women followers in the savage slayings of
actress Sharon Tate and six others.
The state said it will ask the death penalty for all.
The defendants, who staged wild outbursts during
their seven-month trial, sat passively as verdicts were
returned on the 27 counts against them.
After jurors were polled, Manson muttered
audibly, referring to them: "I think they're all
guilty." After the verdicts were all in, he shouted at
the judge: "We're still not allowed to put on a
defense. You won't outlive that, old man."
The jury of seven men and five women, who had
deliberated 12 hours and 40 minutes since receiving
the case Jan. 15 , was ordered to return to court at 9
a.m. Thursday for the penalty phase of the trial. They
will continue to be sequestered.
The prosecutor said he has about 5 0 witnesses
ready for the penalty trial. The defense has said it will
put on a case as long or longer than the state's seeking
life imprisonment instead of the death penalty on a
contention there still is doubt as to guilt.
Phnom Penh Attacked
PHNOM PENH — North Vietnamese and Viet Cong
soldiers launched attacks Monday night against the
defense perimeter of Phnom Penh, tense Cambodian
capital under dusk to-dawn curfew because of an
enemy war of terror spreading in the streets.
Capt. Chhang Song, a Cambodian high command
spokesman, said the major battle was fought at the
village of Phnom Prey Khiev, 2 4 miles northwest of
the capital, where an enemy force of 5 00 struck half

an hour after darkness. The other battles were at
Saant, 18 miles south of the capital, and Lovea Sar
Kandal, 28 miles to the southeast.
All three enemy assaults were driven back by air
strikes at nidnight, he said.
The curfew order in Phnom Penh followed an
attempt to bomb the South Vietnamese Embassy on
a main boulevard and new attacks on the city's outer
edges and the airport, already severely damaged by an
enemy raid last Friday.
In Saigon, the South Vietnamese government
proposed Tuesday that it and North Vietnam release
immediately all sick and wounded prisoners of war,
including American airmen held in the North.
North Vietnam has consistently refused to
negotiate a prisoner exchange without a definite
schedule for complete withdrawal of all U.S. troops.
A Viet Cong cease-fire went into effect in South
Vietnam for the four day Tet lunar new year but the
holiday is not observed in Cambodia except by
minority populations of Vietnamese and Chinese.
Saigon headquarters said the Viet Cong violated
the cease-fire soon after it took effect with two
attacks that killed six South Vietnamese and
wounded 22. The U.S. Command reported no actions
against American units in the first hours of the enemy
standdown.
Southern Crossing
SACRAMENTO — A San Francisco Bay Area
legislator has introduced the year's third bill to delay
construction of the controversial Southern Crossing
bridge over the bay.
Sen. Alfred Alquist on Monday proposed a ban on
construction until the region's Metropolitan
Transportation Commission sends its report on the
plan to the legislature in January 1973.

"A thorough re-evaluation of the decision to build
this bridge is absolutely necessary," the San JOse
Democrat said. He introduced a similar bill last year,
but it was killed in the Assembly Transportation
Committee.
Ugandan President Out
KAMPALA, Uganda — Army dissidents claimed the
overthrow of President Milton Obote Monday, as he
was heading home from the Common-wealth summit
in Singapore, and warned other governments not to
interfere.
A few hours after Radio Uganda announced the
takeover, Obote arrived in nearby Nairobi, Kenya,
and associates said he had established radio contact
with Kampala.
"The army takes over power and warns all foreign
countries to keep noses out of Uganda's internal
affairs," said the Uganda broadcast. It made the
victory claim after 1 2 hours of fighting with a rival
faction of the armed forces in which an
undertermined number of persons were reported
killed.
Venue Rights
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court guaranteed all
criminal defendants Monday the right to seek a trial
in a community that is not prejudiced against them.
The guarantee came in an 8-1 decision that upset
the conviction of the Rev. James E. Groppi for
resisting arrest during a civil rights march in
Milwaukee in 1 9 67.
The priest had been active in the civil rights
movement, and he contended the jury at his trial
would reflect community prejudice against him.
