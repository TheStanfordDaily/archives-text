# New Provost
## Miller Exhibits 'Quiet Logic' 
### TOM GIVEN 
"The substance of a university is the
form with which we do our business,"
says the sign on Bill Miller's desk. It
reminds the visitor that taking care of
business is his speciality.
His business at hand is moving from
his post as vice president for university
research to his new desk as provost. It's
a bit out of his original field of
computer science, but the transition
has been a logical one.
Quiet logic and the jargon of
computer science constantly crop up in

his conversation; Miller's very
conception of the job can be visualized
in a computed perspective. "One
doesn't program a university like one
would program an industry or a single
research institute," he says, "one wants
to remain flexible."
Flexible Position
Like the university, his job is
flexible. "I see myself as the chief Dean
principally responsible for curriculum
and research, with some responsibilities
in the area of student affairs. Of course,

when the president is away, I will be
the acting president, which means I
have to keep current with him."
Him, of course, is Richard Lyman,
Miller's predecessor as provost. Lyman
was noted for his role vis-a-vis campus
unrest, and Miller acknowledges that,
"the president has asserted a certain
leadership in this field." Not contesting
this leadership, he plans to spend little
time on campus disruptions and devote
most of his efforts towards academic
affairs.
Practical Man
In this field, he is strongly oriented
towards pragmatic problem-solving
research in addition to conventional
academic disciplines. Miller feels that
such research, "does a lot to help
students and faculty give reality to
discipline studies they're involved in."
He sees the addition of these course's
as a balancing of the discipline studies
of the past, "I don't want the entire
faculty and student body to change;
this is just, a rounding out of the
program." No believer in a panacea of
relevance, he notes that "A little of
that goes a very long way.'"
He considers such an approach
positive rather than middle-of-the-road,
combining as it does the "tools" of the
discipline with opportunities of
problem solving. Indeed, he notes that,
"Education itself Ls a tool ... it is an
enriching experience and one students
can capitalize on."
The greatest failing of current
education. Miller says, is the failure to
make education an enriching
experience, one that will help a student
to live in a complex world. "What we
fail to do," he says, "is tell students
what the world's like out there."
In his last post, as vice president for
university research, Miller did attempt
to bring the outside world into the
university. Groups of faculty and
students are now planning proposals for
further research in four fields - all a
result of Miller's study of university
research.
Building from Bottom
"My role has been to point out
funding possibilities, help people get
organized, and encourage people with
ideas," Miller says. "This is not like
industry where you can set something
up from above. It starts from the
bottom up; it's not me setting them
up."
The proposals are in fields from
community development to continuing
education to various aspects of ecology.

He defends this, and other university
research, saying, "We won't solve
complex problems by hiding from
them.We need a larger percentage of
undergraduates in research programs,
for they provide an untapped source of
innovation."
For the present, Bill Miller will
remain in builidng 2, preparing for the
move to building 10, to a bigger office,
a bigger staff, and a bigger job.
Considering he just got a promotion, all
that is really quite logical.

The Student Development
Committee, a group organized to let
students know about the condition
of University finances and to raise
money for the University, is
sponsoring a weekly lecture series on
Stanford beginning next week.
The series, which begins
Thursday, January 28, will open
with a historical overview of the
University,and will conclude on
March 11, with an address by
President Richard Lyman, entitled
"1 98 4 And All That: Stanford in
the Future."
The week of February 22,
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
vice-president for finances, and
Raymond F. Bacchetti, associate
provost will on the financial
puzzle presented by the University.
