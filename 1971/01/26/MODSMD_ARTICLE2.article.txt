# New Provost
## Miller Exhibits 'Quiet Logic' 
### TOM GIVEN 
"The substance of a university is the
form with which we do our business,"
says the sign on Bill Miller's desk. It
reminds the visitor that taking care of
business is his speciality.
His business at hand is moving from
his post as vice president for university
research to his new desk as provost. It's
a bit out of his original field of
computer science, but the transition
has been a logical one.
Quiet logic and the jargon of
computer science constantly crop up in

his conversation; Miller's very
conception of the job can be visualized
in a computed perspective. "One
doesn't program a university like one
would program an industry or a single
research institute," he says, "one wants
to remain flexible."
Flexible Position
Like the university, his job is
flexible. "I see myself as the chief Dean
principally responsible for curriculum
and research, with some responsibilities
in the area of student affairs. Of course,

when the president is away, I will be
the acting president, which means I
have to keep current with him."
Him, of course, is Richard Lyman,
Miller's predecessor as provost. Lyman
was noted for his role vis-a-vis campus
unrest, and Miller acknowledges that,
"the president has asserted a certain
leadership in this field." Not contesting
this leadership, he plans to spend little
time on campus disruptions and devote
most of his efforts towards academic
affairs.
Practical Man
In this field, he is strongly oriented
towards pragmatic problem-solving
research in addition to conventional
academic disciplines. Miller feels that
such research, "does a lot to help
students and faculty give reality to
discipline studies they're involved in."
He sees the addition of these course's
as a balancing of the discipline studies
of the past, "I don't want the entire
faculty and student body to change;
this is just, a rounding out of the
program." No believer in a panacea of
relevance, he notes that "A little of
that goes a very long way.'"
