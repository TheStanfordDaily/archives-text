Prof. H. Bruce Franklin was arrested at
a Los Siete rally yesterday and charged
with felonious assault on a police
officer.
Witnesses among the 200 marchers
claimed that five members of the Sari
Mateo County Tactical Squad grabbed
Franklin, wrestled him to the
pavement, and roughed him up. The
incident occurred after the Los Siete
arraignment was postponed.
Franklin is expected to be arraigned
today at 1:30 p.m. at the San Mateo
County Courthouse. His
pre-arraignment bail was set at $6250.
Later he was also charged with
resisting arrest.
Franklin has been near the head of
marchers while two vans and several
carloads cruised along side of crowd.
The police then stopped ahead of the
demonstrators, got out of their
vehicles, and briefly tried to hold back
the crowd before charging into the
front. One witness claimed several
officers yelled, "Franklin, we're going
to get you."
Five police grabbed him and
witnesses say one kicked him in the
groin as he toppled to the ground. The
witness said another struck him in the
back of the neck with his club as
Franklin lay on the ground. He was led
away in handcuffs while shouting to
the crowd.
Police Account
People in the crowd loudly
protested the arrest. However,
Assistant Sheriff Eugene Stewart of the
San Mateo County Sheriff's Dept. later
said that Franklin hit Deputy Jim
Burns when the officer tried to clear
the crowd. The Palo Alto Times
reported that according to bystanders
the English professor had elbowed a
deputy when the policeman pushed
him in the back with his club.
Earlier the police had warned the
marchers to stay on the sidewalk and
not spill into the street. At the time of
the arrest the demonstrators were
crossing a railroad crossing where there
was no clear sidewalk area.
When the police blocked the
intersection ahead, the marchers stalled
and moved out farther from the side of
the street. Police later claimed a green
pick-up had stopped and they had
halted the crowd in an attempt to clear
the street so that the march could
continue. Police then began to push the
crowd back towards the sidewalk area
when Franklin was arrested.
Later it was learned that the driver
of the pick-up was a friend of the
demonstrators and maintained that he
was not in the Intersection blocking
traffic.
Mrs. Franklin Speaks
"They had to beat up Bruce so that
the assault and battery charges would

look good," said Franklin's wife Jane.
"Everybody knows that he wasn't
doing anything. A hundred people saw
the pigs attack Bruce. They only make
more revolutionaries when they expose
themselves like this."
A statement from Franklin's group,
Venceremos, said, "Those of us who
witnessed the incident know it was the
tac squad that attacked our comrade,
clubbing him in the groin and brutally
beating him to the ground, with
absolutely no provocation on his part."
Franklin currently is facing a faculty
disciplinary board for his part in
disrupting and heckling a scheduled
speech on Jan. 11, by Henry Cabot
Lodge, former ambassador to South
Vietnam and current ambassador to the
Vatican. Last Thursday, Franklin held a
firey, imprompty press conference
outside president Richard Lyman's
office to denounce the proceedings
against him.
Venceremos has called a noon rally
today concerning Franklin's arrest.
Los Siete Case
Earlier yesterday morning Judge
Roy Seagraves postponed a decision on
whether to dismiss charges of armed
robbery auto theft against the seven
Latinos.
They are accused of stealing a car at
gunpoint five days after a gunbattle in
San Francisco which fatally wounded
officer Joseph Brodnik. Los Siete were
acquitted in November of the murder
charge.
The defense attorneys stated that
Los Siete had not been arraigned on the
charges pending until November 7,
1970 when the alleged crime had taken

place over 18 months earlier.
"During the time Los Siete was in
jail awaiting trial for the murder charge
in San Franicsco they could easily have
been brought to Redwood City for
arraignment. As it was the defense team
was completely unaware that the
charges were pending and we were
taken completely by surprise," stated
one of the attorneys.
The defense cited a number of
Supreme Court decisions in support of
their motion. The Supreme Court had
ruled that it was a breach of justice to
delay in informing defendants that they
will be charged with crimes.
Defense Claims
The defense also stated that "the
defendants in this case had been run
around from county to county, our
clients have been framed up on bogus
charges many times since their acquital
on the murder charges, and the court
has the obligation to stop this
railroad."
The judge postponed ruling on the
motion until he had time to read the
pertinent Supreme Court cases.
Monday, Feb. 4 , was set as the date for
a new hearing.
During the arraignment the crowd
outside chanted and marched in front
of the Court House steps. The San
Francisco Mime Troupe Gorillia
Marching Band accompanied the chants
with drums and music.
After leaving the Court House, Tony
Martinez, one of Los Siete spoke to the
crowd from the steps. "Our judge isn't
in there," he said, "it's out here in the
streets. The poeple are our judges, not
the facist pigs in there."
