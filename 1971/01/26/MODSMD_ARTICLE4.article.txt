# Palo Alto Votes Today On Superblock Project
## 
### 
Heavy voting is expected today in
the special Palo Alto election on the
Bryant Street Project, also known as
Superblock.
The city clerk's office bases this
prediction on the exceptionally high
number of requests for absentee ballots
which have been filed.
The 31,901 eligible voters have been
asked to approve a downtown
development which includes two eleven
story office towers, a two story
commercial building, and a branch
office of the Bank of America. The
structure also includes a three level
underground garage which will hold
1 206 automobiles.
The 3-acre site is bounded by
University, Ramona, Lytton and
Florence, if completed will be 7 4
percent open space.
Under the plan the city would issue
bonds to finance a three million dollar
contribution toward construction of

the garage. The city would also provide
another half million dollars for a
commercial area beautification project.
A majority vote for the proposition
would give approval to 1) the
implementation of the project, 2) the
zoning change, 3) the agreement of the
City of Palo Alto, the Parking
Authority, and the developer.
The results of the election should be
known by late tonight.
The Proposition reads as follows:
Shall the Bryant Street Project, as
defined in Resolution No. 43 90 calling
the election at which this proposition is
submitted, and Ordinance No. 2589
