# Leningrad 11
## Soviet Jews -'Let My People Go' 
### 
To languish in prison for
committing a crime is one thing.
To die in Siberia because your
background is Jewish and you
want to leave Russia is another.
Nine .Jews and two Gentiles
were recently convicted by a
Soviet court for an attempted
hijacking of a Soviet airliner. Two
of them were sentenced to death,
although their sentence was
commuted to fifteen years at hard
labor after a world-wide outcry
against the sentence The
Leningrad 11, as the group is
known did not hijack a plane;
tney did not advocate violence;
they did not plot to subvert the
state. They simply wanted to
leave.
Virtually all press reports have
called the trial an example of
Russian anti-Semitism. The Soviet
government does not encourage
j<nti-Jewish activities through
special legislation, but seemingly

minor occurences tend to stifle
the Jewish culture.
Since Stalin's era the
government has urged the Jews to
assimilate, but the more pressure
Moscow exerts, the more the Jews
refuse to abandon their heritage.
When two powerful forces meet,
something will explode. The
recent Leningrad trial was the first
major public explosion.
Anti-Semitism feeling in Russia
can oedirectly traced historically.
All Jewish theaters and
publications were closed in 19 48
as part of a massive crackdown
against the Jews. The Soviet
government claims it has not had
enough money to finance the
J e w i sh -opera ted, S tat e -o w n ed
businesses since.
Furthermore, the identification
cards, which everyone must carry,
stamped "JEWISH" segregate the
Soviet Jews and eliminate them
from job competition in many

areas. Still, the Soviet government
can truthfully profess that no
anti-Semitic laws exist on the
books. Although three million
Jews pursue their culture, they are
socially alienated and many crave
to get out of the Soviet Union.
Legally they usually can't.
Since 1 967 only 1,300 Jews
have been permitted to leave the
Soviet Union and go to Israel
although 4 0,000 Jewish families
have been denied the necessary
applications.
Authorities generally agree that
Soviet officials refuse to let the

Commentary

Jewish families leave because:
politically, it would be a direct
slap at the Arabs; since so many
of the Soviet Jews are involved in
the technological society, any
exodus could seriously hurt the
country's efforts there; and a
minority exodus would serve as
clear evidence to much of the
world community that there is
anti-Semitic feeling in the Soviet
Union.
Because of the attempts to
emigrate, the Soviet government
apparently created an
object-lesson palatable to the
public in the trial of the
Leningrad eleven.
Press accounts agree that after
the government denied visas to
the 11, the group decided to
hijack an AN-2 aircraft from a
field near Leningrad, fly to
Sweden, and then immigrate to
Israel. The code-named 'Operation
Wedding' never got off the
ground; members of the KGB
seized the would-be emigrants at
the airport.
An accurate account of later
events is difficult to obtain. The
propaganda element of course was
active on the pro-Jewish and
anti-Jewish sides. Tass, (the
official Soviet news agency)
reported that the hijackers had
planned to "Leave the pilots in
the woods, tied hand and foot,
with mouths gagged and heads
battered by brass knuckles."
Western papers denied many of
these allegations.
Openly striving to extinguish
public desires to leave Russia,
Soviet officials condemned two of
the 11 men to death for high
treason and sentenced the other
nine to lengthy prison terms.
According to the New York
Times, "There is a monstrous
disproportion between the alleged
crime and capital punishment."
Although the death penalty
against the two was later revoked,
Tass described the verdict as

"humanitarian from the point of
view of society and every
individual in it."
The Russian public
unquestioningly accepted the trial
sentences. Tass explained, "Public
opinion welcomed the court's
verdict with satisfaction, because
the verdict is, incidentally, in
complete agreement with the
recent decision of the General
Assembly which categorically
condemns all acts of air piracy,
terming them grave crimes."
On the contrary, the Western
world retaliated with reminders of
human rights after the
announcement of the capital
punishments.
To the countless Jewish groups
which bombarded the Russian
embassies with telegrams and
notes of abomination, the
Russians replied, "Zionist circles
in the U.S. are continuing to whip
up routine attacks of anti-Soviet
hysteria."
But not only Jews were
outraged. Several U.S. Senators
urged the U.S. government to
protest, and Pope Paul VI
requested reconsideration of the
sentences.
Russia dismissed the
remonstrances as "Israeli-or
iented." Commented Tass:
"Judging from the facts, the
anti-Soviet campaign unleashed by
the Zionist organization is
conducted by Israel, whose Prime
Minister, Golda Meir, apparently
speaking in defense of the
sentenced men, wishes to draw
society's attention away from the
black deeds being perpetrated by
Israeli militarists in the Middle
East."
At Stanford the attitude
towards the trial and Russian
anti-Semitism is generally bitter
and open.
Many Jews express strong
feelings though some request that
neither their name be mentioned
nor their opinions quoted.
By and large, the people on
campus argue that the Soviet
government devised the hijacking
plot and Leningrad trial to divert

sally geisler

the public eye from recent
Russian international failings and
as means to further Arab-Russian
relations.
Moreover, nearly everyone
interviewed agreed that the entire
affairâ€”'Operation Wedding,' the
trial, and the post-trial support in
the Soviet press were fabrications
to further anti-Semitic feeling.
Because the KGB picked up
the would-be hijackers at an
opportune moment prior to the
plane's take-off, many people feel
that the government planted a
squealer into the group.
"Nothing is spontaneous in the
Soviet Union," explains history
Professor Ivo Lederer. He sees the
tip-off explanation as plausible.
Allegedly, when a person is
arrested for a minor crime in
Russia, the court will lighten his
sentence if he will submit to spy
on his Communist 'brothers.'
According to one Russian
emigrant residing in San
Francisco, this occurs in order to
"frighten others" and to "maintain
good sentiment about Russia."
"The Leningrad trial," he
explains, "puts the prisoners on a
type of negative-pedestal."
Professor Lederer snid, "The
Russian government doesn't like to
put up with acts of courage."
As a result, the stiff sentences
meted out to the eleven prisoners
were devised to "teach the public a
lesson."
According to Lederer, minor
trials of Jews have occuring
for many years, as some Jews have
been "browbeaten" by Russian
officials to assimilate and abandon
their cultural heritage.
Stanford's Rabbi Familant
regards the trial and proceedings
as "an absolute lie."
. He claims that the
discrepancies in factual
information and the supposed
violent plot of the Jews is "totally
uncharacteristic of the way the
Jews would leave a country. They
would get out quickly and
peaceable."

Jewish families leave because:
politically, it would be a direct
slap at the Arabs; since so many
of the Soviet Jews are involved in
the technological society, any
exodus could seriously hurt the
country's efforts there; and a
minority exodus would serve as
clear evidence to much of the
world community that there is
anti-Semitic feeling in the Soviet
Union.
Because of the attempts to
emigrate, the Soviet government
apparently created an
object-lesson palatable to the
public in the trial of the
Leningrad eleven.
Press accounts agree that after
the government denied visas to
the 11, the group decided to
hijack an AN-2 aircraft from a
field near Leningrad, fly to
Sweden, and then immigrate to
Israel. The code-named 'Operation
Wedding' never got off the
ground; members of the KGB
seized the would-be emigrants at
the airport.
An accurate account of later
events is difficult to obtain. The
propaganda element of course was
active on the pro-Jewish and
anti-Jewish sides. Tass, (the
official Soviet news agency)
reported that the hijackers had
planned to "Leave the pilots in
the woods, tied hand and foot,
with mouths gagged and heads
battered by brass knuckles."
Western papers denied many of
these allegations.
Openly striving to extinguish
public desires to leave Russia,
Soviet officials condemned two of
the 11 men to death for high
treason and sentenced the other
nine to lengthy prison terms.
According to the New York
Times, "There is a monstrous
disproportion between the alleged
crime and capital punishment."
Although the death penalty
against the two was later revoked,
Tass described the verdict as

"humanitarian from the point of
view of society and every
individual in it."
The Russian public
unquestioningly accepted the trial
sentences. Tass explained, "Public
opinion welcomed the court's
verdict with satisfaction, because
the verdict is, incidentally, in
complete agreement with the
recent decision of the General
Assembly which categorically
condemns all acts of air piracy,
terming them grave crimes."
On the contrary, the Western
world retaliated with reminders of
human rights after the
announcement of the capital
punishments.
To the countless Jewish groups
which bombarded the Russian
embassies with telegrams and
notes of abomination, the
Russians replied, "Zionist circles
in the U.S. are continuing to whip
up routine attacks of anti-Soviet
hysteria."
But not only Jews were
outraged. Several U.S. Senators
urged the U.S. government to
protest, and Pope Paul VI
requested reconsideration of the
sentences.
Russia dismissed the
remonstrances as "Israeli-or
iented." Commented Tass:
"Judging from the facts, the
anti-Soviet campaign unleashed by
the Zionist organization is
conducted by Israel, whose Prime
Minister, Golda Meir, apparently
speaking in defense of the
sentenced men, wishes to draw
society's attention away from the
black deeds being perpetrated by
Israeli militarists in the Middle
East."
At Stanford the attitude
towards the trial and Russian
anti-Semitism is generally bitter
and open.
Many Jews express strong
feelings though some request that
neither their name be mentioned
nor their opinions quoted.
By and large, the people on
campus argue that the Soviet
government devised the hijacking
plot and Leningrad trial to divert

the public eye from recent
Russian international failings and
as means to further Arab-Russian
relations.
Moreover, nearly everyone
interviewed agreed that the entire
affairâ€”'Operation Wedding,' the
trial, and the post-trial support in
the Soviet press were fabrications
to further anti-Semitic feeling.
Because the KGB picked up
the would-be hijackers at an
opportune moment prior to the
plane's take-off, many people feel
that the government planted a
squealer into the group.
"Nothing is spontaneous in the
Soviet Union," explains history
Professor Ivo Lederer. He sees the
tip-off explanation as plausible.
Allegedly, when a person is
arrested for a minor crime in
Russia, the court will lighten his
sentence if he will submit to spy
on his Communist 'brothers.'
According to one Russian
emigrant residing in San
Francisco, this occurs in order to
"frighten others" and to "maintain
good sentiment about Russia."
"The Leningrad trial," he
explains, "puts the prisoners on a
type of negative-pedestal."
Professor Lederer snid, "The
Russian government doesn't like to
put up with acts of courage."
As a result, the stiff sentences
meted out to the eleven prisoners
were devised to "teach the public a
lesson."
According to Lederer, minor
trials of Jews have occuring
for many years, as some Jews have
been "browbeaten" by Russian
officials to assimilate and abandon
their cultural heritage.
Stanford's Rabbi Familant
regards the trial and proceedings
as "an absolute lie."
. He claims that the
discrepancies in factual
information and the supposed
violent plot of the Jews is "totally
uncharacteristic of the way the
Jews would leave a country. They
would get out quickly and
peaceable."

Nine .Jews and two Gentiles
were recently convicted by a
Soviet court for an attempted
hijacking of a Soviet airliner. Two
of them were sentenced to death,
although their sentence was
commuted to fifteen years at hard
labor after a world-wide outcry
against the sentence The
Leningrad 11, as the group is
known did not hijack a plane;
tney did not advocate violence;
they did not plot to subvert the
state. They simply wanted to
leave.
Virtually all press reports have
called the trial an example of
Russian anti-Semitism. The Soviet
government does not encourage
j<nti-Jewish activities through
special legislation, but seemingly

minor occurences tend to stifle
the Jewish culture.
Since Stalin's era the
government has urged the Jews to
assimilate, but the more pressure
Moscow exerts, the more the Jews
refuse to abandon their heritage.
When two powerful forces meet,
something will explode. The
recent Leningrad trial was the first

as part of a massive crackdown

Furthermore, the identification
cards, which everyone must carry,
stamped "JEWISH" segregate the
Soviet Jews and eliminate them
from job competition in many

areas. Still, the Soviet government
can truthfully profess that no
anti-Semitic laws exist on the

The Russian public
unquestioningly accepted the trial
sentences. Tass explained, "Public
opinion welcomed the court's
verdict with satisfaction, because
the verdict is, incidentally, in
complete agreement with the
recent decision of the General
Assembly which categorically
condemns all acts of air piracy,
terming them grave crimes."
On the contrary, the Western
world retaliated with reminders of
human rights after the
announcement of the capital
punishments.
To the countless Jewish groups
which bombarded the Russian
embassies with telegrams and
notes of abomination, the
Russians replied, "Zionist circles
in the U.S. are continuing to whip
up routine attacks of anti-Soviet
hysteria."
But not only Jews were
outraged. Several U.S. Senators
urged the U.S. government to
protest, and Pope Paul VI
requested reconsideration of the
sentences.
Russia dismissed the
remonstrances as "Israeli-or
iented." Commented Tass:
"Judging from the facts, the
anti-Soviet campaign unleashed by
the Zionist organization is
conducted by Israel, whose Prime
Minister, Golda Meir, apparently
speaking in defense of the
sentenced men, wishes to draw
society's attention away from the
black deeds being perpetrated by
Israeli militarists in the Middle
East."
At Stanford the attitude
towards the trial and Russian
anti-Semitism is generally bitter
and open.
Many Jews express strong
feelings though some request that
neither their name be mentioned
nor their opinions quoted.
By and large, the people on
campus argue that the Soviet
government devised the hijacking
plot and Leningrad trial to divert

sally geisler

the public eye from recent
Russian international failings and
as means to further Arab-Russian
relations.
Moreover, nearly everyone
interviewed agreed that the entire
affairâ€”'Operation Wedding,' the
trial, and the post-trial support in
the Soviet press were fabrications
to further anti-Semitic feeling.
Because the KGB picked up
the would-be hijackers at an
opportune moment prior to the
plane's take-off, many people feel
that the government planted a
squealer into the group.
"Nothing is spontaneous in the
Soviet Union," explains history
Professor Ivo Lederer. He sees the
tip-off explanation as plausible.
Allegedly, when a person is
arrested for a minor crime in
Russia, the court will lighten his
sentence if he will submit to spy
on his Communist 'brothers.'
According to one Russian
emigrant residing in San
Francisco, this occurs in order to
"frighten others" and to "maintain
good sentiment about Russia."
"The Leningrad trial," he
explains, "puts the prisoners on a
type of negative-pedestal."
Professor Lederer snid, "The
Russian government doesn't like to
put up with acts of courage."
As a result, the stiff sentences
meted out to the eleven prisoners
were devised to "teach the public a
lesson."
According to Lederer, minor
trials of Jews have occuring
for many years, as some Jews have
been "browbeaten" by Russian
officials to assimilate and abandon
their cultural heritage.
Stanford's Rabbi Familant
regards the trial and proceedings
as "an absolute lie."
. He claims that the
discrepancies in factual
information and the supposed
violent plot of the Jews is "totally
uncharacteristic of the way the
Jews would leave a country. They
would get out quickly and
peaceable."

Nine .Jews and two Gentiles
were recently convicted by a
Soviet court for an attempted
hijacking of a Soviet airliner. Two
of them were sentenced to death,
although their sentence was
commuted to fifteen years at hard
labor after a world-wide outcry
against the sentence The
Leningrad 11, as the group is
known did not hijack a plane;
tney did not advocate violence;
they did not plot to subvert the
state. They simply wanted to
leave.
Virtually all press reports have
called the trial an example of
Russian anti-Semitism. The Soviet
government does not encourage
j<nti-Jewish activities through
special legislation, but seemingly

minor occurences tend to stifle
the Jewish culture.
Since Stalin's era the
government has urged the Jews to
assimilate, but the more pressure
Moscow exerts, the more the Jews
refuse to abandon their heritage.
When two powerful forces meet,
something will explode. The
recent Leningrad trial was the first
major public explosion.
Anti-Semitism feeling in Russia
can oedirectly traced historically.
All Jewish theaters and
publications were closed in 19 48
as part of a massive crackdown
against the Jews. The Soviet
government claims it has not had
enough money to finance the
J e w i sh -opera ted, S tat e -o w n ed
businesses since.
Furthermore, the identification
cards, which everyone must carry,
stamped "JEWISH" segregate the
Soviet Jews and eliminate them
from job competition in many

areas. Still, the Soviet government
can truthfully profess that no
anti-Semitic laws exist on the
books. Although three million
Jews pursue their culture, they are
socially alienated and many crave
to get out of the Soviet Union.
Legally they usually can't.
Since 1 967 only 1,300 Jews
have been permitted to leave the
Soviet Union and go to Israel
although 4 0,000 Jewish families
have been denied the necessary
applications.
Authorities generally agree that
Soviet officials refuse to let the

Commentary

Jewish families leave because:
politically, it would be a direct
slap at the Arabs; since so many
of the Soviet Jews are involved in
the technological society, any
exodus could seriously hurt the
country's efforts there; and a
minority exodus would serve as
clear evidence to much of the
world community that there is
anti-Semitic feeling in the Soviet
Union.
Because of the attempts to
emigrate, the Soviet government
apparently created an
object-lesson palatable to the
public in the trial of the
Leningrad eleven.
Press accounts agree that after
the government denied visas to
the 11, the group decided to
hijack an AN-2 aircraft from a
field near Leningrad, fly to
Sweden, and then immigrate to
Israel. The code-named 'Operation
Wedding' never got off the
ground; members of the KGB
seized the would-be emigrants at
the airport.
An accurate account of later
events is difficult to obtain. The
propaganda element of course was
active on the pro-Jewish and
anti-Jewish sides. Tass, (the
official Soviet news agency)
reported that the hijackers had
planned to "Leave the pilots in
the woods, tied hand and foot,
with mouths gagged and heads
battered by brass knuckles."
Western papers denied many of
these allegations.
Openly striving to extinguish
public desires to leave Russia,
Soviet officials condemned two of
the 11 men to death for high
treason and sentenced the other
nine to lengthy prison terms.
According to the New York
Times, "There is a monstrous
disproportion between the alleged
crime and capital punishment."
Although the death penalty
against the two was later revoked,
Tass described the verdict as

"humanitarian from the point of
view of society and every
individual in it."

plane's take-off, many people feel
that the government planted a
squealer into the group.
"Nothing is spontaneous in the
Soviet Union," explains history
Professor Ivo Lederer. He sees the
tip-off explanation as plausible.
Allegedly, when a person is
arrested for a minor crime in
Russia, the court will lighten his
sentence if he will submit to spy
on his Communist 'brothers.'
According to one Russian
emigrant residing in San
Francisco, this occurs in order to
"frighten others" and to "maintain
good sentiment about Russia."
"The Leningrad trial," he
explains, "puts the prisoners on a
type of negative-pedestal."
Professor Lederer snid, "The
Russian government doesn't like to
put up with acts of courage."
As a result, the stiff sentences
meted out to the eleven prisoners
were devised to "teach the public a
lesson."
According to Lederer, minor
trials of Jews have occuring
for many years, as some Jews have
been "browbeaten" by Russian
officials to assimilate and abandon
their cultural heritage.
Stanford's Rabbi Familant
regards the trial and proceedings
as "an absolute lie."
. He claims that the
discrepancies in factual
information and the supposed
violent plot of the Jews is "totally
uncharacteristic of the way the
Jews would leave a country. They
would get out quickly and
peaceable."

To languish in prison for
committing a crime is one thing.
To die in Siberia because your
background is Jewish and you
want to leave Russia is another.
Nine .Jews and two Gentiles
were recently convicted by a
Soviet court for an attempted
hijacking of a Soviet airliner. Two
of them were sentenced to death,
although their sentence was
commuted to fifteen years at hard
labor after a world-wide outcry
against the sentence The
Leningrad 11, as the group is
known did not hijack a plane;
tney did not advocate violence;
they did not plot to subvert the
state. They simply wanted to
leave.
Virtually all press reports have
called the trial an example of
Russian anti-Semitism. The Soviet
government does not encourage
j<nti-Jewish activities through
special legislation, but seemingly

minor occurences tend to stifle
the Jewish culture.
Since Stalin's era the
government has urged the Jews to
assimilate, but the more pressure
Moscow exerts, the more the Jews
refuse to abandon their heritage.
When two powerful forces meet,
something will explode. The
recent Leningrad trial was the first
major public explosion.
Anti-Semitism feeling in Russia
can oedirectly traced historically.
All Jewish theaters and
publications were closed in 19 48
as part of a massive crackdown
against the Jews. The Soviet
government claims it has not had
enough money to finance the
J e w i sh -opera ted, S tat e -o w n ed
businesses since.
Furthermore, the identification
cards, which everyone must carry,
stamped "JEWISH" segregate the
Soviet Jews and eliminate them
from job competition in many

areas. Still, the Soviet government
can truthfully profess that no
anti-Semitic laws exist on the
books. Although three million
Jews pursue their culture, they are
socially alienated and many crave
to get out of the Soviet Union.
Legally they usually can't.
Since 1 967 only 1,300 Jews
have been permitted to leave the
Soviet Union and go to Israel
although 4 0,000 Jewish families
have been denied the necessary
applications.
Authorities generally agree that
Soviet officials refuse to let the

Commentary

Jewish families leave because:
politically, it would be a direct
slap at the Arabs; since so many
of the Soviet Jews are involved in
the technological society, any
exodus could seriously hurt the
country's efforts there; and a
minority exodus would serve as
clear evidence to much of the
world community that there is
anti-Semitic feeling in the Soviet
Union.
Because of the attempts to
emigrate, the Soviet government
apparently created an
object-lesson palatable to the
public in the trial of the
Leningrad eleven.
Press accounts agree that after
the government denied visas to
the 11, the group decided to
hijack an AN-2 aircraft from a
field near Leningrad, fly to
Sweden, and then immigrate to
Israel. The code-named 'Operation
Wedding' never got off the
ground; members of the KGB
seized the would-be emigrants at
the airport.
An accurate account of later
events is difficult to obtain. The
propaganda element of course was
active on the pro-Jewish and
anti-Jewish sides. Tass, (the
official Soviet news agency)
reported that the hijackers had
planned to "Leave the pilots in
the woods, tied hand and foot,
with mouths gagged and heads
battered by brass knuckles."
Western papers denied many of
these allegations.
Openly striving to extinguish
public desires to leave Russia,
Soviet officials condemned two of
the 11 men to death for high
treason and sentenced the other
nine to lengthy prison terms.
According to the New York
Times, "There is a monstrous
disproportion between the alleged
crime and capital punishment."
Although the death penalty
against the two was later revoked,
Tass described the verdict as

"humanitarian from the point of
view of society and every
individual in it."
The Russian public
unquestioningly accepted the trial
sentences. Tass explained, "Public
opinion welcomed the court's
verdict with satisfaction, because
the verdict is, incidentally, in
complete agreement with the
recent decision of the General
Assembly which categorically
condemns all acts of air piracy,
terming them grave crimes."
On the contrary, the Western
world retaliated with reminders of
human rights after the
announcement of the capital
punishments.
To the countless Jewish groups
which bombarded the Russian
embassies with telegrams and
notes of abomination, the
Russians replied, "Zionist circles
in the U.S. are continuing to whip
up routine attacks of anti-Soviet
hysteria."
But not only Jews were
outraged. Several U.S. Senators
urged the U.S. government to
protest, and Pope Paul VI
requested reconsideration of the
sentences.
Russia dismissed the
remonstrances as "Israeli-or
iented." Commented Tass:
"Judging from the facts, the
anti-Soviet campaign unleashed by
the Zionist organization is
conducted by Israel, whose Prime
Minister, Golda Meir, apparently
speaking in defense of the
sentenced men, wishes to draw
society's attention away from the
black deeds being perpetrated by
Israeli militarists in the Middle
East."
At Stanford the attitude
towards the trial and Russian
anti-Semitism is generally bitter
and open.
Many Jews express strong
feelings though some request that
neither their name be mentioned
nor their opinions quoted.
By and large, the people on
campus argue that the Soviet
government devised the hijacking
plot and Leningrad trial to divert

the public eye from recent
Russian international failings and
as means to further Arab-Russian
relations.
Moreover, nearly everyone
interviewed agreed that the entire
affairâ€”'Operation Wedding,' the
trial, and the post-trial support in
the Soviet press were fabrications
to further anti-Semitic feeling.
Because the KGB picked up
the would-be hijackers at an
opportune moment prior to the
plane's take-off, many people feel
that the government planted a
squealer into the group.
