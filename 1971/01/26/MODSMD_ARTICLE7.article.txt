pelvic exams
Editor, THE DAILY:
A number of women are upset
at having to pay $7.50 at Cowell
Health Center for pelvic
examinations. Having already paid
our health care fees, we believe
this expense should certainly be
included. Over 1000 women at
Stanford use birth control pills
and all must pay the $7.50 fee.
Some women who have the
examination for other than
contraceptive purposes do not
have to pay. We feel no one
should have to pay this expense as
this is discriminatory and places
an unfair burden on many women
who wish to have sexual relations,
but who must (as historically been
the case) "pay the price." The fee
also places a financial burden on
women who may just want a
check up for other medical
reasons and who are often asked
to pay.
Beyond this, we feel that
Cowell should have available
health care for all women in the
Stanford community during
pregnancy-rather than offering her
nothing-thereby discouraging her
from trying to be a mother and a

student and often forcing her to
make a choice.
There will be a meeting in
Tresidder today at 4:15 for all
women interested in discussing
what we can do to eliminate
inadequate health care at Cowell
and to circulate the following
petition:
We, men and women of the
Stanford community, feel the
$7.50 fee for a pelvic examination
at Cowell Health Center is not in
keeping with the Health Center's
functions and is discriminating.
We would like to see it ended as
soon as possible. Further, we
believe that the Health Center
should serve the needs of the
graduate students' wives (and
husbands) as they are a part of the
Stanford community and need
health care.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Behind Professor Kahn's pretty
conceits lies plain old sophistry.
No one is questioning a faculty
member's right to "fulfill his
function" in terms of
promulgating ideas, however

unpopular. The problem occurs
when ideas descend 1 to action.
Should we have around a Nazi
professor whose "function" is to
"grab my revolver when I hear the
word culture" (Alfred Rosenberg)
and discharge it at a concert? No
group effort can tolerate action
destructive of its fundamental
purpose. Imagine a football team
with a quixotic ball-carrier who
backpedals ... For a university,
the inviolable rule of the game is
the advancement of open inquiry.
Messrs' Franklin and Kahn
would object that the rules of the
game must be suspended: the
outrageous disruption corresponds
to the enormity of the "war
crimes" committed by Mr. Lodge.
That is, they say he has
committed these crimes. Other
reasonable men do not agree on
the absoluteness of Mr. Lodge's
guilt, which alone would justify
absolute revolt. Until we are
proven wrong, we have no option
but to insist that orderly
procedures prevail.
What seems like reasonable
compromise to a group will
always appear as radical injustice
to some, the purists of one sort or
another. And since the purists
differ among one another as to

who has wronged whom, the way
is open to dire factionalism, civil
war. Since no institution can exist
in such a climate, it is a plausible
assumption that there are some
among us who want Stanford to
cease existing, i.e. as a place where
differing views can coexist.
If a man can't get a "fair
hearing" on a campus like ours,
where in tarnation can he? Such
childish perfectionism is
queasy-making when we recognize
the aggressive scheme it masks.
Actually, the threat of injustice is
the reverse of what Professor
Kahn grr tends to fear: an
adequate judgment concerning the
violation of ground-rules is far
likelier to emerge from a huddle
of football grunts.

pelvic exams
Editor, THE DAILY:
A number of women are upset
at having to pay $7.50 at Cowell
Health Center for pelvic
examinations. Having already paid
our health care fees, we believe
this expense should certainly be
included. Over 1000 women at
Stanford use birth control pills
and all must pay the $7.50 fee.
Some women who have the
examination for other than
contraceptive purposes do not
have to pay. We feel no one
should have to pay this expense as
this is discriminatory and places
an unfair burden on many women
who wish to have sexual relations,
but who must (as historically been
the case) "pay the price." The fee
also places a financial burden on
women who may just want a
check up for other medical
reasons and who are often asked
to pay.
Beyond this, we feel that
Cowell should have available
health care for all women in the
Stanford community during
pregnancy-rather than offering her
nothing-thereby discouraging her
from trying to be a mother and a

student and often forcing her to
make a choice.
There will be a meeting in
Tresidder today at 4:15 for all
women interested in discussing
what we can do to eliminate
inadequate health care at Cowell
and to circulate the following
petition:
We, men and women of the
Stanford community, feel the
$7.50 fee for a pelvic examination
at Cowell Health Center is not in
keeping with the Health Center's
functions and is discriminating.
We would like to see it ended as
soon as possible. Further, we
believe that the Health Center
should serve the needs of the
graduate students' wives (and
husbands) as they are a part of the
Stanford community and need
health care.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Behind Professor Kahn's pretty
conceits lies plain old sophistry.
No one is questioning a faculty
member's right to "fulfill his
function" in terms of
promulgating ideas, however

unpopular. The problem occurs
when ideas descend 1 to action.
Should we have around a Nazi
professor whose "function" is to
"grab my revolver when I hear the
word culture" (Alfred Rosenberg)
and discharge it at a concert? No
group effort can tolerate action
destructive of its fundamental
purpose. Imagine a football team
with a quixotic ball-carrier who
backpedals ... For a university,
the inviolable rule of the game is
the advancement of open inquiry.
Messrs' Franklin and Kahn
would object that the rules of the
game must be suspended: the
outrageous disruption corresponds
to the enormity of the "war
crimes" committed by Mr. Lodge.
That is, they say he has
committed these crimes. Other
reasonable men do not agree on
the absoluteness of Mr. Lodge's
guilt, which alone would justify
absolute revolt. Until we are
proven wrong, we have no option
but to insist that orderly
procedures prevail.
What seems like reasonable
compromise to a group will
always appear as radical injustice
to some, the purists of one sort or
another. And since the purists
differ among one another as to

who has wronged whom, the way
is open to dire factionalism, civil
war. Since no institution can exist
in such a climate, it is a plausible
assumption that there are some
among us who want Stanford to
cease existing, i.e. as a place where
differing views can coexist.
If a man can't get a "fair
hearing" on a campus like ours,
where in tarnation can he? Such
childish perfectionism is
queasy-making when we recognize
the aggressive scheme it masks.
Actually, the threat of injustice is
the reverse of what Professor
Kahn grr tends to fear: an
adequate judgment concerning the
violation of ground-rules is far
likelier to emerge from a huddle
of football grunts.
