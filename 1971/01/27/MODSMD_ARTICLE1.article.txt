# Superblock Voted Down
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The Bryant Street Project— or, as it was
affectionately known, Superblock—went down
to a defeat at the hands of Palo Alto's voters
yesterday, 1 0,269 to 6,5 7 2.
Voter turnout was only moderate— city
officials had predicted somewhat heavier
voting— and the count was nearly complete by
10 p.m.
In a surprisingly one-sided vote, Palo Altans
rejected the proposed development of the two
downtown blocks bounded by University,
Lytton, Florence, and Ramona into a three-acre
center that was to include two 11 -story office
buildings, a two-story commercial building, a
one-story Bank of America branch, and a
three-level underground parking garage. Some
two acres of the project land were to be
grass-and-walkway "open space."
The entire project was to cost $12 million,
of which $4 million was the estimated cost of
the 1 200-space parking garage, which was to be
owned by the city.
Of the three acres involved, 63 percent is
city property, which was to be sold to Cornish
& Carey, the developer, for $64 0,000.
Opponents of the project cited their fears of
"overdevelopment" and urbanization of
suburban Palo Alto, of increased traffic and air
pollution, and of intensification of the area's
already-critical housing shortage. Their
arguments were aided by confusion over the
financial aspects of the project; the city's selling

price of $6 4 0 ,000 for the two acres was
strangely below an earlier appraisal of
$875 ,000, and the underground garage was
characterized as a money-losing "white
elephant" that would serve no one but the
developer and saddle the city with a $4 million
debt.
Superblock supporters claimed that the
project was necessary to "rejuvenate" the
downtown area. They held that the city's
selling price was reasonable under a rather
complicated zoning change that brought into
consideration the inclusion of parking facilities
and open space in the plan, and that whatever
loss the garage incurred was to be made up by
assessments on downtown merchants, who
appeared to be heavily behind the proposition.
TTiey characterized Superblock as "an
opportunity for controlled development."
Richard Rosenbaum, head of a citizen's
committee to "block the Superb Jock," saw the
rejection of the project by 69 percent of the
voters as "an indication that people are
beginning to question the value of unlimited
growth." Rosenbaum attributed the heavy
margin to the garage's "dubious economies,"
which he believed contributed greatly to the
weight of anti-Superblock arguments.
Developer Scott Carey blamed defeat partly
to the fact that on the fact that Superblock
became "a very complicated legal issue."
"The future of the downtown area is in

grave jeopardy," Carey said last night. "It's a
tragedy that after twenty years the merchants
have finally put up money for this sort of
improvement, and it was rejected by the
city ... I really think that the opponents have
promised some alternatives, and I think they
now have a responsibility to deliver." When
questioned on the future of the Superblock
land, Carey said: "It's gone— there is no
future."
City Councilman Kirke Comstock, long an
opponent of the project, disagreed. "It's very
clear that it's a rejection by the community of
this sort of unnecessary over-development and
urban compression . . . What it means in the
future is up to the Council. The message is
quite clear," Comstock said late last night.
On the future of the two-block acre,
Comstock was fairly optimistic. "It's going to
develop in the conventional manner," he said,
referring to the immediate plans of the Bank of
America to build a branch office on
the site of three existing buildings at the corner
of University and Bryant.
And so the problem of what to do with that
two acres of city-owned land (most of which is
now occupied by the old police station) is again
before the City Council.
What was left last nighty was a post-mortem
for Cornish & Carey, and a celebration for
Superblock's victorious opponents. Said
Comstock, "It feels good."

grass-and-walkway "open space."
The entire project was to cost $12 million,
of which $4 million was the estimated cost of
the 1 200-space parking garage, which was to be
owned by the city.
Of the three acres involved, 63 percent is
city property, which was to be sold to Cornish
& Carey, the developer, for $64 0,000.
Opponents of the project cited their fears of
"overdevelopment" and urbanization of
suburban Palo Alto, of increased traffic and air
pollution, and of intensification of the area's
already-critical housing shortage. Their
arguments were aided by confusion over the
financial aspects of the project; the city's selling

price of $6 4 0 ,000 for the two acres was
strangely below an earlier appraisal of
$875 ,000, and the underground garage was
characterized as a money-losing "white
elephant" that would serve no one but the
developer and saddle the city with a $4 million
debt.
Superblock supporters claimed that the
project was necessary to "rejuvenate" the
downtown area. They held that the city's
selling price was reasonable under a rather
complicated zoning change that brought into
consideration the inclusion of parking facilities
and open space in the plan, and that whatever
loss the garage incurred was to be made up by
assessments on downtown merchants, who
appeared to be heavily behind the proposition.
TTiey characterized Superblock as "an
opportunity for controlled development."
Richard Rosenbaum, head of a citizen's
committee to "block the Superb Jock," saw the
rejection of the project by 69 percent of the
voters as "an indication that people are
beginning to question the value of unlimited
growth." Rosenbaum attributed the heavy
margin to the garage's "dubious economies,"
which he believed contributed greatly to the
weight of anti-Superblock arguments.
Developer Scott Carey blamed defeat partly
to the fact that on the fact that Superblock
became "a very complicated legal issue."
"The future of the downtown area is in

grave jeopardy," Carey said last night. "It's a
tragedy that after twenty years the merchants
have finally put up money for this sort of
improvement, and it was rejected by the
city ... I really think that the opponents have
promised some alternatives, and I think they
now have a responsibility to deliver." When
questioned on the future of the Superblock
land, Carey said: "It's gone— there is no
future."
City Councilman Kirke Comstock, long an
opponent of the project, disagreed. "It's very
clear that it's a rejection by the community of
this sort of unnecessary over-development and
urban compression . . . What it means in the
future is up to the Council. The message is
quite clear," Comstock said late last night.
On the future of the two-block acre,
Comstock was fairly optimistic. "It's going to
develop in the conventional manner," he said,
referring to the immediate plans of the Bank of
America to build a branch office on
the site of three existing buildings at the corner
of University and Bryant.
And so the problem of what to do with that
two acres of city-owned land (most of which is
now occupied by the old police station) is again
before the City Council.
What was left last nighty was a post-mortem
for Cornish & Carey, and a celebration for
Superblock's victorious opponents. Said
Comstock, "It feels good."


SUPERBLOCKED—PaIo Alto voters yesterday turned down a proposal to build two eleven-story
office buildings, two smaller buildings, and an underground garage, on a three-acre site in
downtown Palo Alto. Officially known as the Bryant Street Project, the development had been the
subject of heated debate for the last few weeks.
The Bryant Street Project— or, as it was
affectionately known, Superblock—went down
to a defeat at the hands of Palo Alto's voters
yesterday, 1 0,269 to 6,5 7 2.
Voter turnout was only moderate— city
officials had predicted somewhat heavier
voting— and the count was nearly complete by
10 p.m.
In a surprisingly one-sided vote, Palo Altans
rejected the proposed development of the two
downtown blocks bounded by University,
Lytton, Florence, and Ramona into a three-acre
center that was to include two 11 -story office
buildings, a two-story commercial building, a
one-story Bank of America branch, and a
three-level underground parking garage. Some
two acres of the project land were to be
grass-and-walkway "open space."
The entire project was to cost $12 million,
of which $4 million was the estimated cost of
the 1 200-space parking garage, which was to be
