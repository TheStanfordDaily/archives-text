# Still Undefeated
## Piedmont Falls To Ruggers 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It took Wade Killefer a minute
to catch his breath after having
been put out of bounds by the
Piedmont forward. Rugby is a
game of hard hitting, and a good
solid shoulder to the solar plexus
is not an uncommon occurence.
However, nobody had even
figured on working up much of a
sweat against the club team from
across the Bay.
Last year, Stanford had rolled
over Piedmont and run up 48
points in the process. Last
Saturday, the Indian ruggers clung
to a shakey 6-3 lead midway
through the second half and were
having difficulty in mounting a
sustained attack.

The Tribe was not handling the
ball cleanly in the backfield, and
Piedmont's accurate kicking game
had kept them pinned in their
own end for the better part of the
first half. Fach team had missed
scoring opportunities on penalty
kicks, and it looked as if the first
forty minutes of play were going
to end in a scoreless draw when
Jim Kauffman took a good pass
and broke to the outside.
Kauffman put a move on one
man, forced the Piedmont
fullback to commit himself, then
dumped the ball off to wing Eric
Cross trailing along the sidelines.
Cross is a novice on the rugby
field, but a goal line smells like a
goal line no matter what the

game, and Eric angled for the
corner and touched the ball down
for a three point try to give
Stanford the lead at the half.
Kip Oxman boosted the
Indians to a 6-0 advantage with a
penalty kick, but as the clock
continued to run in the second
period, Piedmont narrowed the
margin to 6-3, and then, with a
little more than two minutes
remaining, evened it up on a
penalty kick.
Maybe it took the sight of the
ball sailing over the crossbar to
fire the Indians up, but whatever
it was, the Stanford fifteen finally
began playing like defending
national champions.
Winning a set scrum at about

niidfield, halfback Jim Squeri got
the ball out quickly to the line of
backs advancing smoothly on the
Piedmont goal. Jack Shultz broke
one tackle, then another in the
corner, and raced under the posts
for the try. The conversion
attempt was wide, but Stanford
led 9-6.
Piedmont kicked off, and
before the fans had even settled in
their seats, Kauffman was off to
the races on a scoring try of his
own to put it out of reach 12-6.
The Indians, with three wins
on the books, face the Bay Area
Touring Side, BATS, this
Saturday in what has to be one of
the biggest games of the season.
