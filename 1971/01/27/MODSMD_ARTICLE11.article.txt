# Senate Factions Unite To Uphold Veto
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Diverse ideological elements of the
ASSU Senate combined last night to
uphold president Pat C. Shea's veto of
two Senate appointments to trustee
committees and opened the door for
new nominations.
Shea's I veto negated a Senate
resolution! which appointed Doug
McHenry lo the Trustee Committee on
Planning end Development and Tim
Coburn to the Trustee Committee on
Land Development. After upholding
the veto, the Senate shifted McHenry

to Land Development and Peter Muhs
was named to the Planning and
Development committee.
"McHenry, being rather fickle,
wanted to switch to the Land
Development committee, and the
blacks supported him," explained
senator John Shoch. "The conservatives
wanted their man (Muhs) to fill the
vacated Planning and Development
position. The alliance was expedient
and inevitable. All they had to do was
eliminate the most "qualified person,
who had previously been approved."

Bob Grant of the ASSU Council of
Presidents offered another
interpretation of the Senate's action.
"The decision tonight upheld the
principle that student representatives
on University committees should be
chosen by the Nominations Committee
on the basis of qualification and not by
the Senate on the basis of political
alliance.
Spring Selection
"Peter and Doug were both selected
by the Nominations Committee last
Spring on the basis of their application
and interview. Any student of whatever
political affiliation may now apply for
a committee position and expect to be
selected on the basis of his
qualifications and not be dependent
upon the support of a faction in the
Senate."
Later in the meeting, Grant told the
Senate in response to sharp questioning
that News Director Bob Beyers had
sold them advertising space at a
discount so that the presidents could
afford to print their "Report to the
Student Body," which appeared in last
Friday's Daily, at a reduced cost to the
ASSU.
Grant disclosed that Beyers would
be reimbursed "from the administrative
funds of the ASSU presidents. But as of
this meeting, we don't know how much
it will cost." Grant later explained that
space had to be purchased by the
Council because the Daily was unable
to print it free of charge.
The Senate shifted its focus from

local to national affairs through the
passage of three resolutions on behalf
of Bobby Seale, Angela Davis, and Los
Siete de la Ra/.a.
In a resoltuion sponsored by B.
Davie Napier, professor of religion, and
senators Owen Blank and Doug
McHenry, the Senate asked that the
United States judicial system afford
"unqualified justice — justice, and
justice alone — to Bobby Seale, Angela
Davis, and Los Siete de la Ra/.a."
The Senate also voted to appropriate
$75 from its General Contingency
funds, allocating $25 each to the legal
defense funds of Seale, Davis and Los
Siete.
Academic Senate
Finally, the Senate requested the
faculty Academic Senate to act as soon
as possible on the ASSU Senate
resolution which called for unqualified
justice for the defendants.
In other business, the Senate filled
the three positions on the Committee
on Nominations. Olivier Keonig was
appointed as the graduate
representative, Rischa Williams, a
freshman, was named to the
undergraduate slot, and freshman
Woodrow Myers was appointed
representative-at-large.

faculty Academic Senate to act as soon
as possible on the ASSU Senate
resolution which called for unqualified
justice for the defendants.
In other business, the Senate filled
the three positions on the Committee
on Nominations. Olivier Keonig was
appointed as the graduate
representative, Rischa Williams, a
freshman, was named to the
undergraduate slot, and freshman
Woodrow Myers was appointed
representative-at-large.
Diverse ideological elements of the
ASSU Senate combined last night to
uphold president Pat C. Shea's veto of
two Senate appointments to trustee
committees and opened the door for
new nominations.
Shea's I veto negated a Senate
resolution! which appointed Doug
McHenry lo the Trustee Committee on
Planning end Development and Tim
Coburn to the Trustee Committee on
Land Development. After upholding
the veto, the Senate shifted McHenry

to Land Development and Peter Muhs
was named to the Planning and
Development committee.
"McHenry, being rather fickle,
wanted to switch to the Land
Development committee, and the
blacks supported him," explained
senator John Shoch. "The conservatives
wanted their man (Muhs) to fill the
vacated Planning and Development
position. The alliance was expedient
and inevitable. All they had to do was
eliminate the most "qualified person,
who had previously been approved."

Bob Grant of the ASSU Council of
Presidents offered another
interpretation of the Senate's action.
"The decision tonight upheld the
principle that student representatives
on University committees should be
chosen by the Nominations Committee
on the basis of qualification and not by
the Senate on the basis of political
alliance.
Spring Selection
"Peter and Doug were both selected
by the Nominations Committee last
Spring on the basis of their application
and interview. Any student of whatever
political affiliation may now apply for
a committee position and expect to be
selected on the basis of his
qualifications and not be dependent
upon the support of a faction in the
Senate."
Later in the meeting, Grant told the
Senate in response to sharp questioning
that News Director Bob Beyers had
sold them advertising space at a
discount so that the presidents could
afford to print their "Report to the
Student Body," which appeared in last
Friday's Daily, at a reduced cost to the
ASSU.
Grant disclosed that Beyers would
be reimbursed "from the administrative
funds of the ASSU presidents. But as of
this meeting, we don't know how much
it will cost." Grant later explained that
space had to be purchased by the
Council because the Daily was unable
to print it free of charge.
The Senate shifted its focus from

local to national affairs through the
passage of three resolutions on behalf
of Bobby Seale, Angela Davis, and Los
Siete de la Ra/.a.
In a resoltuion sponsored by B.
Davie Napier, professor of religion, and
senators Owen Blank and Doug
McHenry, the Senate asked that the
United States judicial system afford
"unqualified justice — justice, and
justice alone — to Bobby Seale, Angela
Davis, and Los Siete de la Ra/.a."
The Senate also voted to appropriate
$75 from its General Contingency
funds, allocating $25 each to the legal
defense funds of Seale, Davis and Los
Siete.
