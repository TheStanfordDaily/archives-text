Mansfield Asks Viet Timetable
"The time has come to work harder to get the
President to specify a withdrawal schedule for all troops
from all of Indochina — lock, stock and barrel," Senate
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) told a
nationwide television audience last night.
He also called for additional troop withdrawals from
Europe.
"We should hold hearings, lay out the story and bring
the situation to the attention of the poeple," he said.
In a generally non-partisan, low-profile "Conversation
with the Senate Majority Leader," Mansfield said that
he Nixon administration had "disturbed and distorted"
tne meaning of the Cooper-Church Amendment,
intended to limit U.S. presence in Cambodia.
He termed Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird's
recent policy clarifications "contrary to fact."
Mansfield, speaking for the Democratic Party, said he
will introduce a resolution calling for the withdrawal of
substantial numbers of troops from Europe. He
suggested that about half of the 70,000 U.S. troops
there should be brought home and European nations
should be encouraged to protect themselves.
Mansfield also defended the Congressional seniority
system, noting that the system has "worked remarkably
well" over the years. However, he said it might be weil
to modify the system by setting age limits for Senators,
he said.
US To Replace Planes
WASHINGTON — The United States will speed the
delivery of planes and helicopters to Cambodia to
replace equipment destroyed in last week's Communist
attack on Phnom Penh airport, the Defense Department
reported Tuesday.
Pentagon spokesman Jerry W. Friedheim said this is

part of the $25 5 million in aid provided lor under the
military Assistant Program approved by Congress last
year.
Friedheim said the aircraft would include Huey and
Chinook helicopters, C 4 7 transports and single-engine
T2Bs, propeller driven planes used in close air support
lor ground troops. The Hueys can be used as gunships or
as utility helicopters while the larger Chinooks are
generally used to haul troops and supplies..
"We are expediting the delivery of some aircraft
already programmed, and these aircraft will be of a
capability similar to those destroyed and are a part of
the congressional ly approved Cambodian military
assistance program," Friedheim told newsmen.
He gave no figures on the number of aircraft to be
delivered.
Venus Craft Speaks
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union reported Tuesday it had
received the world's first message from the surface of
Venus over millions of miles of space.
The message was transmitted by Venus 7 , a reinforced
spacecraft, that entered the hot and dense atmosphere of
Venus Dec. 15 and landed on the torrid surface, Tass
news agency reported.
Americans have walked on the moon and talked with
the earth but never has a man made but unmanned
vehicle landed on any planet in the solar system and sent
back data. Tass said Venus 7 transmitted for 23 minutes
on the surface of Venus.
Tass reported a surface temperature of 8 75 degrees,
plus or minus 68 degrees. Previous Venus probes
recorded degrees of 500 or so but never reached the
surlace. Tass said Venus 7 recorded gradually rising
temperatures as it neared the surface.
The dense atmosphere of Venus produced 90 times
the pressure of that on earth, give or tak > 15
atmospheres, Tass said.
