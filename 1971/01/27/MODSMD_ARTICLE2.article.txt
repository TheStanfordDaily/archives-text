# Franklin Faces Court, Released Without Bail
## 
### 
Associate Professor H. Bruce
Franklin, charged with assault and
battery on a police officer and resisting
arrest during a Los Siete rally Monday,
was released from Redwood City jail
yesterday afternoon.
After being arraigned, Franklin was
released on his own recognisance.
Police had set pre-arraignment bail at
$6250. His actual release from custody
came nearly four hours after the
arraignment.
Franklin later told the Daily that he
was kept in an isolation cell in the
prison but that he had managed to talk
with some of the other prisoners. "In
jail, everybody's a revolutionary
anyway," he said. Â»
He said that his head and neck were
sore and that he had sustained "some
bruises" when he was arrested. Talking
briefly with a reporter, he seemed to be
in excellent spirits.
Not A Stranger
Franklin stated that he was not
intimidated by the felony charges
against him, and noted that he had first
confronted Redwood City police
during a 1966 Port Authority hearing
concerning a munitions plant on the
Bay.
About 60 of Franklin's supporters
left a noon White Plaza rally and, under
constant police surveillance, traveled to
the well-guarded San Mateo County
Courthouse, site of the arraignment.
Only a handful of those present were
permitted to enter the courtroom,
while the remainder waited quietly
outside the door on a small, circular
balcony. About a dozen policemen and
police matrons were also present.
Franklin was taken to his
arraignment under heavy guard.
Wearing handcuffs, chains, and
leg-irons, he said that he and the other
prisoners were given a four-car escourt.
He also left the courtroom under heavy
guard. Shotgun-equipped police cars
circled the courthouse.
Wife Speaks
During the White Plaza rally, about
175 persons gathered for more than an
hour to hear three speakers, including
Franklin's wife, Jane, discuss Franklin's
development as a revolutionary, the

events leading up to his arrest Monday
morning, and some of the background
of Los Siete.
English Department Chairman lan
Watt said that Franklin's class, English
27 0-B, had been "postponed." Franklin
last night questioned that postponment
and said that the class would meet at its
normal time today.

In a possibly related development,
the Stanford Police Department
reported two acts of vandalism Monday
night and early yesterday morning.
A lone male broke five windows and
one door at Bowman Alumni House. A
janitor, who was working inside at the
time, reported the incident to police.
Slogans including "Free Los Siete,"
"Death to Lie-man," and "Power to the
People" were painted on President
Richard Lyman's former campus
residence. Cars near the home, located
at 45 0 El Escarpade, were also painted.
University officials had no
immediate estimate of the damages.
