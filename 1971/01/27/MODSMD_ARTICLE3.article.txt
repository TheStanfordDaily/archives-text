# Lodge Disruption Cited
## Library Employee Suspended 
### FRED MANN 
A University employee will be
suspended from his job for alleged
violation of the campus disruption
policy in connection with the
appearance here by Henry Cabot Lodge
on January 11.
John Keilch, 24, a former student
and currently a technical processing
assistant at Meyer Library received
word last Friday that he was to be
suspended without pay for three
months and placed on probation an
additional six months for his part in the
disruption that forced cancellation of
Lodge's speech in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The decision was made by Director
of University Libraries David Weber
after it was learned that Keilch was no
longer a student and therefore .not

subject to disciplinary rulings handed
down by the Stanford Judicial Council.
He was originally one of the 11 persons
indicted by the SJC.
Later Sent
Upon learning that Keilch was not a
student, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz sent a letter to
Weber informing him that there was
information indicating that Keilch was
involved in the heckling, and that he
was therefore subject to disciplinary
proceedings for breaking the University
disruption policy.
Schwartz made no recommendation
of action to Weber.
Weber judged Keilch guilty of
"unacceptable behavior" and imposed
the suspension. It does not take effect
until 5:00 p.m. February 5 in order
that Keilch might have time to find

other employment for the period, and
instigate "standard University grievance
proceedures," said Weber.
The grievance proceedure consists of
filing a written appeal with the director
(Weber) for a reduction of punishment.
If denied, the employee may appeal to
the Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations Robert Nelson.
The final appeal is made to the
appropriate vice president, in this case,
Provost William Miller, or a three-man
reviewing committee consisting of a
representative for the employee, one
for the management, and President
Richard Lyman.
Keilch has begun appeals.
Class Distinction
"There is an obvious class
distinction shown when the University
deals with workers as opposed to
students and faculty," said Keilch.
"With them (students and faculty), the
University goes through the entire
routine of hearings and trials. But the
workers are under their thumb. They
don't even fake justice with us."
Keilch, a member of Venceremos
and what Weber described as "an
adequate employee as far as I can tell,"
believes his case sets a precedent in
University-employee relations. "New
worker organizations developed last
year, and there is more and more
ferment, both politically and
economically, among workers over
their treatment by the University," he
said.
Library employees are currently
organizing in support of Keilch and his

appeal to retain his position. This is the
first time any employee has been
disciplined for violating the disruption
policy.
In determining appropriate action
against Keilch, Weber said he took into
account the fact that Keilch had been
employed less than six months, and was
therefore still within the mandatory
probationary period to which all
employees are subject.
Following his suspension period,
Keilch will enter another probationary
period of six months in which time any
further policy violation will result in
termination.
"That's ridiculous," said Keilch in
response. "Even if I do anything again
after my probation is over 1 know they
would fire me."
