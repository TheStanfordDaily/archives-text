# Lodge Disruption Cited
## Library Employee Suspended 
### FRED MANN 
A University employee will be
suspended from his job for alleged
violation of the campus disruption
policy in connection with the
appearance here by Henry Cabot Lodge
on January 11.
John Keilch, 24, a former student
and currently a technical processing
assistant at Meyer Library received
word last Friday that he was to be
suspended without pay for three
months and placed on probation an
additional six months for his part in the
disruption that forced cancellation of
Lodge's speech in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
The decision was made by Director
of University Libraries David Weber
after it was learned that Keilch was no
longer a student and therefore .not

subject to disciplinary rulings handed
down by the Stanford Judicial Council.
He was originally one of the 11 persons
indicted by the SJC.
Later Sent
Upon learning that Keilch was not a
student, Special Assistant to the
President John Schwartz sent a letter to
Weber informing him that there was
information indicating that Keilch was
involved in the heckling, and that he
was therefore subject to disciplinary
proceedings for breaking the University
disruption policy.
Schwartz made no recommendation
of action to Weber.
Weber judged Keilch guilty of
"unacceptable behavior" and imposed
the suspension. It does not take effect
until 5:00 p.m. February 5 in order
that Keilch might have time to find

other employment for the period, and
instigate "standard University grievance
proceedures," said Weber.
The grievance proceedure consists of
filing a written appeal with the director
(Weber) for a reduction of punishment.
If denied, the employee may appeal to
the Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations Robert Nelson.
The final appeal is made to the
appropriate vice president, in this case,
Provost William Miller, or a three-man
reviewing committee consisting of a
representative for the employee, one
for the management, and President
Richard Lyman.
Keilch has begun appeals.
