# Faculty Commission Recommends New Self—Discipline Procedures
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Calling the University's present
arrangements for faculty self-discipline
"terribly rudimentary and disheveled,"
a faculty commission today
recommended a new system of
self-discipline.
In a report circulating to all

members of the Academic Council, a
commission of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(A\AUP) unanimously recommended
standards for faculty conduct, a range
of disciplinary sanctions, and a
multiphase process for hearing

individual cases.
The commission recommended five
standards which faculty members
should follow; classified sanctions that
might be applied to faculty members
found guilty of violating the standards;
and outlined the composure and
proceedings of a faculty tribunal which
would try an defendant.
The report will be discussed by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow and discussed
by the entire faculty at meetings to be
arranged. Headed by Law Prof. Herbert
L. Packer, the commission was formed
in September in response to the
AAUP's National Commission
statement on faculty freedom. Any
changes in the current
faculty-disciplinary procedures would
require approval by the Faculty Senate,
top academic officers of the University,
and the Board of Trustees before being
adopted.
Screening Agent
The system proposed includes an
individual faculty "screening agent"
chosen by the chairman of the Faculty
Senate for initial evaluation of
complaints against a faculty member; a
prosecutor, chosen by the president to
gather evidence and to present the case.
Under the system proposed, any
complaint filed (any person would be
able to file a complaint) would be
referred to the "screening agent." If he
feels the charge is serious enough he
would refer the matter to the

presidential prosecutor who would
conduct the case.
The matter would be heard before
the Dean concerned in the matter or a
faculty tribunal. If the faculty member
charged were not satisfied with the
hearing before the dean, he could ask
for a hearing before the tribunal.
Randomly Chosen
The five-man tribunal would be
chosen randomly to hear the individual
case from an annual panel composed of
five percent of the Academic Council
which would also be chosen randomly.
The chairman of the Faculty Senate
would choose a "non-voting Chairman
of the Tribunal from the Faculty of the
School of Law or from sucii other
faculty members who have similar
experience."
Decisions of the tribunal shall
"require the concurrence of at least
three members" unless dismissal is
recommended and then the
concurrence of at least four members if
required.
Rejecting a very generalized
standard for faculty conduct as
unworkable, the commission said, "A
detailed statement of rules, like that
apparently suggested by President
Hitch for the University of California,
is objectionable because it affords no
flexibility in application, inevitably
contains lacunae, and strikes us as being
inconsistent with the spirit that ought
to obtain in an academic community."
Instead, the commission
recommended "a statement of
standards that can be applied through a
combination of adjudication and
legislation." These five basic standards
would be:
—"No faculty member shall
knowingly violate, or attempt to
violate, any provision of the
University's regulations that have been
duly promulgated and approved by the
Faculty Senate.
—"No faculty member shall engage,
or attempt to engage, in professional
misconduct in the performance of his
academic duties which he has
undertaken to perform within the
University.
—"No faculty member shall prevent,
or directly exhort or incite anyone
(incluidng, without limitation,
students) to prevent, or attempt to
prevent anyone from performing his
duties within the University."
Refusal to appear when summoned
before a faculty tribunal also would
constitute a violation of the proposed
standards for conduct. But a faculty
member, in response to any question,
might invoke his privilege a) not to
incriminate himself, b) not to divulge a

confidential statement from a student
or colleague, or e) not to testify against
his spouse.
The report lists six possible
sanctions against professors Those
called "moderate" include, in ascending
order of severity, 1) a warning, 2) a
censure by the president of the
University, and 3) a monetary fine
deducted from the offender's pay.
Those described as "severe" include 1)
suspension from duty without pay for a
specified period, 2) reduction in pay,
and 3) dismissal from the University, a
penalty to be used only in "extreme or
flagrant cases."
The commission cited four reasons
why faculty members should
strengthen their own mechanisms for
self-discipline although not all the
members agreed with each of the
reasons:
1. "The contemporary malaise of
higher education generates a demand
that faculty members should examine
their institutional responsibilities in
addition to defining their rights.,
2. "We stand at a moment of history
when portions of the radical Left and
the radical Right threaten to crush
what universities stand for. While the
threat from the extreme Left is violent
in character, the extreme Right

protentially poses at least an equivalent
threat.
3. The public universities,
particularly here in California, are
threatened with dire pressures from
outside. Here at Stanford, while the
threat is far less pressing, there are
some external forces which, unless the
faculty acts first, are likely to do a far
less discerning and a much more brutal
job on the University than the faculty
can do for itself."
4. The commission suggests that
although self-discipline is not currently
a problem at Stanford (the report was
written before English Prof. Bruce
Franklin was charged with misconduct
for the Lodge speech disruption) it is
important to consider the problem
before a crisis develops.
Besides Packard, the commission
included as members: J. Merrill
Carlsmith, associate prof. of
psychology; William M. Chace, assistant
prof, of English; Leon Cohen, associate
prof, of medicine-neurology; Gordon
A. Craig, prof, of history; Sidney D.
Drell, prof, of SLAC; Robert A. Goiter,
assistant director of University libraries;
Alphonse G. Juilland, prof, of French;
and Arthur F. Veinott Jr., prof, of
operations research.

would refer the matter to the

presidential prosecutor who would
conduct the case.
The matter would be heard before
the Dean concerned in the matter or a
faculty tribunal. If the faculty member
charged were not satisfied with the
hearing before the dean, he could ask
for a hearing before the tribunal.
Randomly Chosen
The five-man tribunal would be
chosen randomly to hear the individual
case from an annual panel composed of
five percent of the Academic Council
which would also be chosen randomly.
The chairman of the Faculty Senate
would choose a "non-voting Chairman
of the Tribunal from the Faculty of the
School of Law or from sucii other
faculty members who have similar
experience."
Decisions of the tribunal shall
"require the concurrence of at least
three members" unless dismissal is
recommended and then the
concurrence of at least four members if
required.
Rejecting a very generalized
standard for faculty conduct as
unworkable, the commission said, "A
detailed statement of rules, like that
apparently suggested by President
Hitch for the University of California,
is objectionable because it affords no
flexibility in application, inevitably
contains lacunae, and strikes us as being
inconsistent with the spirit that ought
to obtain in an academic community."
Instead, the commission
recommended "a statement of
standards that can be applied through a
combination of adjudication and
legislation." These five basic standards
would be:
—"No faculty member shall
knowingly violate, or attempt to
violate, any provision of the
University's regulations that have been
duly promulgated and approved by the
Faculty Senate.
—"No faculty member shall engage,
or attempt to engage, in professional
misconduct in the performance of his
academic duties which he has
undertaken to perform within the
University.
—"No faculty member shall prevent,
or directly exhort or incite anyone
(incluidng, without limitation,
students) to prevent, or attempt to
prevent anyone from performing his
duties within the University."
Refusal to appear when summoned
before a faculty tribunal also would
constitute a violation of the proposed
standards for conduct. But a faculty
member, in response to any question,
might invoke his privilege a) not to
incriminate himself, b) not to divulge a

confidential statement from a student
or colleague, or e) not to testify against
his spouse.
The report lists six possible
sanctions against professors Those
called "moderate" include, in ascending
order of severity, 1) a warning, 2) a
censure by the president of the
University, and 3) a monetary fine
deducted from the offender's pay.
Those described as "severe" include 1)
suspension from duty without pay for a
specified period, 2) reduction in pay,
and 3) dismissal from the University, a
penalty to be used only in "extreme or
flagrant cases."
The commission cited four reasons
why faculty members should
strengthen their own mechanisms for
self-discipline although not all the
members agreed with each of the
reasons:
1. "The contemporary malaise of
higher education generates a demand
that faculty members should examine
their institutional responsibilities in
addition to defining their rights.,
2. "We stand at a moment of history
when portions of the radical Left and
the radical Right threaten to crush
what universities stand for. While the
threat from the extreme Left is violent
in character, the extreme Right

protentially poses at least an equivalent
threat.
3. The public universities,
particularly here in California, are
threatened with dire pressures from
outside. Here at Stanford, while the
threat is far less pressing, there are
some external forces which, unless the
faculty acts first, are likely to do a far
less discerning and a much more brutal
job on the University than the faculty
can do for itself."
4. The commission suggests that
although self-discipline is not currently
a problem at Stanford (the report was
written before English Prof. Bruce
Franklin was charged with misconduct
for the Lodge speech disruption) it is
important to consider the problem
before a crisis develops.
Besides Packard, the commission
included as members: J. Merrill
Carlsmith, associate prof. of
psychology; William M. Chace, assistant
prof, of English; Leon Cohen, associate
prof, of medicine-neurology; Gordon
A. Craig, prof, of history; Sidney D.
Drell, prof, of SLAC; Robert A. Goiter,
assistant director of University libraries;
Alphonse G. Juilland, prof, of French;
and Arthur F. Veinott Jr., prof, of
operations research.
Calling the University's present
arrangements for faculty self-discipline
"terribly rudimentary and disheveled,"
a faculty commission today
recommended a new system of
self-discipline.
In a report circulating to all

members of the Academic Council, a
commission of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(A\AUP) unanimously recommended
standards for faculty conduct, a range
of disciplinary sanctions, and a
multiphase process for hearing

individual cases.
The commission recommended five
standards which faculty members
should follow; classified sanctions that
might be applied to faculty members
found guilty of violating the standards;
and outlined the composure and
proceedings of a faculty tribunal which
would try an defendant.
The report will be discussed by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow and discussed
by the entire faculty at meetings to be
arranged. Headed by Law Prof. Herbert
L. Packer, the commission was formed
in September in response to the
AAUP's National Commission
statement on faculty freedom. Any
changes in the current
faculty-disciplinary procedures would
require approval by the Faculty Senate,
top academic officers of the University,
and the Board of Trustees before being

or attempt to engage, in professional
misconduct in the performance of his
academic duties which he has
undertaken to perform within the
University.
—"No faculty member shall prevent,
or directly exhort or incite anyone
(incluidng, without limitation,
students) to prevent, or attempt to
prevent anyone from performing his
duties within the University."
Refusal to appear when summoned
before a faculty tribunal also would
constitute a violation of the proposed
standards for conduct. But a faculty
member, in response to any question,
might invoke his privilege a) not to
incriminate himself, b) not to divulge a

confidential statement from a student
or colleague, or e) not to testify against
his spouse.
The report lists six possible
sanctions against professors Those
called "moderate" include, in ascending
order of severity, 1) a warning, 2) a
censure by the president of the
University, and 3) a monetary fine
deducted from the offender's pay.
Those described as "severe" include 1)
suspension from duty without pay for a
specified period, 2) reduction in pay,
and 3) dismissal from the University, a
penalty to be used only in "extreme or
flagrant cases."
The commission cited four reasons
why faculty members should
strengthen their own mechanisms for
self-discipline although not all the
members agreed with each of the
reasons:
1. "The contemporary malaise of
higher education generates a demand
that faculty members should examine
their institutional responsibilities in
addition to defining their rights.,
2. "We stand at a moment of history
when portions of the radical Left and
the radical Right threaten to crush
what universities stand for. While the
threat from the extreme Left is violent
in character, the extreme Right

protentially poses at least an equivalent
threat.
3. The public universities,
particularly here in California, are
threatened with dire pressures from
outside. Here at Stanford, while the
threat is far less pressing, there are
some external forces which, unless the
faculty acts first, are likely to do a far
less discerning and a much more brutal
job on the University than the faculty
can do for itself."
4. The commission suggests that
although self-discipline is not currently
a problem at Stanford (the report was
written before English Prof. Bruce
Franklin was charged with misconduct
for the Lodge speech disruption) it is
important to consider the problem
before a crisis develops.
Besides Packard, the commission
included as members: J. Merrill
Carlsmith, associate prof. of
psychology; William M. Chace, assistant
prof, of English; Leon Cohen, associate
prof, of medicine-neurology; Gordon
A. Craig, prof, of history; Sidney D.
Drell, prof, of SLAC; Robert A. Goiter,
assistant director of University libraries;
Alphonse G. Juilland, prof, of French;
and Arthur F. Veinott Jr., prof, of
operations research.
Calling the University's present
arrangements for faculty self-discipline
"terribly rudimentary and disheveled,"
a faculty commission today
recommended a new system of
self-discipline.
In a report circulating to all

members of the Academic Council, a
commission of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(A\AUP) unanimously recommended
standards for faculty conduct, a range
of disciplinary sanctions, and a
multiphase process for hearing

individual cases.
The commission recommended five
standards which faculty members
should follow; classified sanctions that
might be applied to faculty members
found guilty of violating the standards;
and outlined the composure and
proceedings of a faculty tribunal which
would try an defendant.
The report will be discussed by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow and discussed
by the entire faculty at meetings to be
arranged. Headed by Law Prof. Herbert
L. Packer, the commission was formed
in September in response to the
AAUP's National Commission
statement on faculty freedom. Any
changes in the current
faculty-disciplinary procedures would
require approval by the Faculty Senate,
top academic officers of the University,
and the Board of Trustees before being
adopted.
Screening Agent
The system proposed includes an
individual faculty "screening agent"
chosen by the chairman of the Faculty
Senate for initial evaluation of
complaints against a faculty member; a
prosecutor, chosen by the president to
gather evidence and to present the case.
Under the system proposed, any
complaint filed (any person would be
able to file a complaint) would be
referred to the "screening agent." If he
feels the charge is serious enough he
would refer the matter to the

presidential prosecutor who would
conduct the case.
The matter would be heard before
the Dean concerned in the matter or a
faculty tribunal. If the faculty member
charged were not satisfied with the
hearing before the dean, he could ask
for a hearing before the tribunal.
Randomly Chosen
The five-man tribunal would be
chosen randomly to hear the individual
case from an annual panel composed of
five percent of the Academic Council
which would also be chosen randomly.
The chairman of the Faculty Senate
would choose a "non-voting Chairman
of the Tribunal from the Faculty of the
School of Law or from sucii other
faculty members who have similar
experience."
Decisions of the tribunal shall
"require the concurrence of at least
three members" unless dismissal is
recommended and then the
concurrence of at least four members if
required.
Rejecting a very generalized
standard for faculty conduct as
unworkable, the commission said, "A
detailed statement of rules, like that
apparently suggested by President
Hitch for the University of California,
is objectionable because it affords no
flexibility in application, inevitably
contains lacunae, and strikes us as being
inconsistent with the spirit that ought
to obtain in an academic community."
Instead, the commission
recommended "a statement of
standards that can be applied through a
combination of adjudication and
legislation." These five basic standards
would be:
—"No faculty member shall
knowingly violate, or attempt to
violate, any provision of the
University's regulations that have been
duly promulgated and approved by the
Faculty Senate.
—"No faculty member shall engage,
or attempt to engage, in professional
misconduct in the performance of his
academic duties which he has
undertaken to perform within the
University.
—"No faculty member shall prevent,
or directly exhort or incite anyone
(incluidng, without limitation,
students) to prevent, or attempt to
prevent anyone from performing his
duties within the University."
Refusal to appear when summoned
before a faculty tribunal also would
constitute a violation of the proposed
standards for conduct. But a faculty
member, in response to any question,
might invoke his privilege a) not to
incriminate himself, b) not to divulge a

confidential statement from a student
or colleague, or e) not to testify against
his spouse.
The report lists six possible

order of severity, 1) a warning, 2) a
censure by the president of the
University, and 3) a monetary fine
deducted from the offender's pay.

suspension from duty without pay for a

and 3) dismissal from the University, a
penalty to be used only in "extreme or
