# Faculty Commission Recommends New Self—Discipline Procedures
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Calling the University's present
arrangements for faculty self-discipline
"terribly rudimentary and disheveled,"
a faculty commission today
recommended a new system of
self-discipline.
In a report circulating to all

members of the Academic Council, a
commission of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors
(A\AUP) unanimously recommended
standards for faculty conduct, a range
of disciplinary sanctions, and a
multiphase process for hearing

individual cases.
The commission recommended five
standards which faculty members
should follow; classified sanctions that
might be applied to faculty members
found guilty of violating the standards;
and outlined the composure and
proceedings of a faculty tribunal which
would try an defendant.
The report will be discussed by the
Faculty Senate tomorrow and discussed
by the entire faculty at meetings to be
arranged. Headed by Law Prof. Herbert
L. Packer, the commission was formed
in September in response to the
AAUP's National Commission
statement on faculty freedom. Any
changes in the current
faculty-disciplinary procedures would
require approval by the Faculty Senate,
top academic officers of the University,
and the Board of Trustees before being
adopted.
Screening Agent
The system proposed includes an
individual faculty "screening agent"
chosen by the chairman of the Faculty
Senate for initial evaluation of
complaints against a faculty member; a
prosecutor, chosen by the president to
gather evidence and to present the case.
Under the system proposed, any
complaint filed (any person would be
able to file a complaint) would be
referred to the "screening agent." If he
feels the charge is serious enough he
would refer the matter to the

presidential prosecutor who would
conduct the case.
The matter would be heard before
the Dean concerned in the matter or a
faculty tribunal. If the faculty member
charged were not satisfied with the
hearing before the dean, he could ask
for a hearing before the tribunal.
Randomly Chosen
The five-man tribunal would be
chosen randomly to hear the individual
case from an annual panel composed of
five percent of the Academic Council
which would also be chosen randomly.
The chairman of the Faculty Senate
would choose a "non-voting Chairman
of the Tribunal from the Faculty of the
School of Law or from sucii other
faculty members who have similar
experience."
Decisions of the tribunal shall
"require the concurrence of at least
three members" unless dismissal is
recommended and then the
concurrence of at least four members if
required.
Rejecting a very generalized
standard for faculty conduct as
unworkable, the commission said, "A
detailed statement of rules, like that
apparently suggested by President
Hitch for the University of California,
is objectionable because it affords no
flexibility in application, inevitably
contains lacunae, and strikes us as being
inconsistent with the spirit that ought
to obtain in an academic community."
