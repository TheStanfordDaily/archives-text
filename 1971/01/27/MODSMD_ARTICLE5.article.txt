# Busy Life For A Bright Machine

Artificial intelligence has been
defined as making a computer do what
a human does when the human is
behaving intelligently. This definition is
sufficiently vague to be useful in
describing the variety of experiments
now being pursued at the Artificial
Intelligence Project of the Depart ment
of Computer Science, located in the
hills behind Stanford.
At the heart of the experimental
work of the AI Project are two
computers hooked together to provide
about 130,000 words of core storage,
less than that of the big IBM 360/67 at
the Computation Center Campus
Facility, but large nonetheless. The AI
Project computer operates in the
.time-share mode, which means that
many people can use it simultaneously.
Input takes place through typewriter
keyboards that are hooked to large
television-like displays which the
computer uses to communicate with
the experimenter. In addition, there are
numerous television monitors,
mechanical arms, and other gadgets
usf'd for diverse experiments. The walls
of the room are covered with
computer-generated portraits of girl
friends, graduate students, peace signs,
and an occasional Playmate.
Man or Machine?
Ol all the experiments in progress,
probably none strikes so strong an
anthropomorphic chord as the
hand-eye project, which is an attempt

to make the computer manipulate
objects in meaningful way. The "hand"
part of the experiment is a mechanical
arm with a motor driven elbow, wrist
and two fingers; the "eye" isa television
camera. Right now the computer is
being programmed to manipulate
blocks in order to play "Instant
Insanity." The arm picks up a block,
moves it to where the TV camera can
see it, rotates the block so that the
computer can determine the color on
each side, and then stacks the blocks in
such a way that four colors are
displayed on each side of the stack.
The machine must be able to
recognize that the object the arm Is
holding is a block, that it has colored
sides, what the colors are (it does thus
by using a filter wheel, the same way
the Surveyor probe took "color"
pictures of the moon), and what the
correct orientation is for each block in
order to solve the puzzle. In addition, it
must direct the arm to move the blocks
in order to examine them, and then to
stack them.
At this point, it takes the computer
about ten minutes to play a complete
game of "Instant Insanity," which must
impress anyone who has spent hours
vainly trying to do the same thing. But,
most of the computer's time is spent in
manipulation of the blocks—determin
ing the correct solution takes only
seconds. The arm is painfully slow and
distressingly clumsy. A movie made
about the hand-eye project several
years ago was entitled "Butterfinger,"

and even now, after much
improvement, the machine plays with
reinforced blocks since the hand has a
tendency to occasionally miss the edge
it was aiming for and smash the block
with one of its steel fingers.
Improvement Planned
A second arm is being readied that
will be much faster, more accurate, and
probably gentler, than the arm now in
use. The new arm, designed as an ME
degree thesis by Victor Scheinman, a
1 969 Stanford alumnus, will be capable
of moving an object from any part of
the playing surface to any other, with
any orientation, in just a few seconds.
A third arm that Will have a
five-fingered hand and eighteen degrees
of freedom (as opposed to the present
six) is now in the planning stage.
A project similar to the
block-stacking machine, in its
usefulness to artificial intelligence
research if in no other way, is a
computer-driven car. While perhaps a
precursor of more elegant machines,
the present vehicle is not exactly a
Ferrari: it looks like a steel table on
perabulator-wheels, with a television
camera mounted on a mast in its
center, and a radio transceiver for
communication with the computer.
Several years ago the car was made
to follow a white line at about five
miles per hour; it is hoped that soon it
will be able to maneuver about in the
laboratory parking lot. The computer is
learning to distinguish between objects
(to be avoided) and shadows (to be run

over). The practical applications are
obvious, but the real value of the car is
what it can teach experimenters about
representation of visual information in
the computer.
Mechanical Rythym
A somewhat different approach to
artificial intelligence is that of
Professors John Chowning and Leland
Smith of the Music Department, who
are using the computer to study the
performance of music. The computer is
given various pieces of information
necessary for it to play a piece:
instrumentation, tempo, duration and
pitch of each note, attack and loudness
of each note, and any variations from
mathematical exactitude that the
performer cares to use. The computer
generates the sounds by use of a
digital-to-analog converter (a machine
that takes the "digital" representation
of information in a machine and
converts it to "analog" representation,
such as an electric current to drive a
loudspeaker). Profs. Chowning and
Smith are learning how to "play" the
computer as one would play any
musical instrument. An important
byproduct is deeper insight into the
nature of music and of musical
performance.
Psychiatrists Kenneth Colby and
Franklin Hilf are using the machine for
research in theoretical psychiatry. One
of their projects involves the use of the
computer as a psychiatric interviewer,
in which the computer, communicating
