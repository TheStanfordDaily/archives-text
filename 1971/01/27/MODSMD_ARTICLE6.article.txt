# Repression Of University Workers
##

Stanford has moved for the
first time to suppress political
activity of employees. John
Keilch, a young worker at
Stanford's Main Library, will be
suspended from his job for three
months.
Keilch's crime was protesting
Lodge's appearance here two
weeks ago. He, along with some
library workers and other
employees, did this on his own
time. Further, there has been no
hearing in which he had a chance
to defend himself.
Last week Keilch learned that
he was charged with violation of
the Administration's Disruption
Policy by Pres. Asst. Schwartz. On
Friday a memo from Schwartz to
David Weber, Director, University
Libraries, and Keilch's supervisor,
was sent informing Weber that
Keilch was to be tried by a
disciplinary board. On the same
day Weber informed Keilch that
he would be suspended from work
for three months and placed on a
one year probation period.
When Keilch objected that he
had no chance to defend himself,
he was told that he could be fired

or suspended without any hearing
or due process.
He was free, they added, to file
a grievance—"lf you feel that you
have been treated improperly or
unfairly in this matter."
The University has stated on a
number of occasions that what a
worker does on free time is not
subject to University discipline.
Last spring the administration
issued a statement that workers
could not participate in the
national strike "because it would
have had to be on University
time."
In the fall when the workers
held a meeting to discuss the
possible unions available to
represent them, the
administration issued a statement
that labor organizing was
acceptable on the workers' own
time.
Political activism and labor
organizing have in the past been
acceptable according to the
administration as long as it is on
the workers' own time. Why is the
administration violating its own
principles in the case of John
Keilch?
John Keilch is a man that most

of the workers in the Main
Library know. He has been active
in politics for several years.
"Last summer Lyman's gang
said that leaflets put up by
workers' organizations were
"unauthorized" and couldn't be
posted on the kiosks. In the fall,
they brought in the NLRB to
divert the employees movement
into a company union. Now they
figure that if they isolate one
employee and punish him, then
other workers will become afraid.
The workers will avoid becoming
active against the war or against
the administration undercutting
our living standards so that more
buildings can be built," stated
Keilch.
The Administration is trying to
divert attention away from the
real issues by intimidating
workers, students and faculty
members. Ten students are being
railroaded out of school, Bruce
Franklin may lose his job, and
John Keilch has been suspended
from work while the government
of this country, the business
interests of this country, of which
Stanford is an integral part, are
intensifying the war against the

peoples of Indochina. Political
prisoners all around (he country
are being crucified because they
try to do something about
oppressed people, and while poor
and working people are being
taken advantage of.
However, whatever the
underlying causes of the
suspension of Keilch six basic
facts standout in his case: 1) It is
the first, open employer
repression for political activity at
Stanford, 2 ) The activity was not
on the job or on company time
but at a public meeting, 3)
"Guilt" was determined by the
President's office in a secret

investigation, 4) The "guilt" was
based on the solicited statements
of administrators and political
opponents, 5) He has had no
opportunity to defend himself, 6)
The Administration permits him
to redress his unfair treatment as a
grievance—straight up to the
President's office which has
already sentenced him to
suspension and probation.
Keilch is the first worker who
has been openly repressed for his
political beliefs, but he is not the
last. For this reason it is
imperative that his case not go
unchallenged.

The Administration is trying to
divert attention away from the
real issues by intimidating
workers, students and faculty
members. Ten students are being
railroaded out of school, Bruce
Franklin may lose his job, and
John Keilch has been suspended
from work while the government

interests of this country, of which
Stanford is an integral part, are

peoples of Indochina. Political
prisoners all around (he country
are being crucified because they
try to do something about
oppressed people, and while poor

taken advantage of.
However, whatever the
underlying causes of the
suspension of Keilch six basic
facts standout in his case: 1) It is
the first, open employer
repression for political activity at
Stanford, 2 ) The activity was not
on the job or on company time
but at a public meeting, 3)
"Guilt" was determined by the
President's office in a secret

investigation, 4) The "guilt" was
based on the solicited statements
of administrators and political
opponents, 5) He has had no
opportunity to defend himself, 6)
The Administration permits him
to redress his unfair treatment as a
grievance—straight up to the
President's office which has
already sentenced him to
suspension and probation.
Keilch is the first worker who
has been openly repressed for his
political beliefs, but he is not the

imperative that his case not go

Stanford has moved for the
first time to suppress political
activity of employees. John
Keilch, a young worker at
Stanford's Main Library, will be
suspended from his job for three
months.
Keilch's crime was protesting
Lodge's appearance here two
weeks ago. He, along with some
library workers and other
employees, did this on his own
time. Further, there has been no
hearing in which he had a chance
to defend himself.
Last week Keilch learned that
he was charged with violation of
the Administration's Disruption
Policy by Pres. Asst. Schwartz. On
Friday a memo from Schwartz to
David Weber, Director, University
Libraries, and Keilch's supervisor,
was sent informing Weber that
Keilch was to be tried by a
disciplinary board. On the same
day Weber informed Keilch that
he would be suspended from work
for three months and placed on a
one year probation period.
When Keilch objected that he
had no chance to defend himself,
he was told that he could be fired

or suspended without any hearing
or due process.
He was free, they added, to file
a grievance—"lf you feel that you
have been treated improperly or
unfairly in this matter."
The University has stated on a
number of occasions that what a
worker does on free time is not
subject to University discipline.
Last spring the administration
issued a statement that workers
could not participate in the
national strike "because it would
have had to be on University
time."
In the fall when the workers
held a meeting to discuss the
possible unions available to
represent them, the
administration issued a statement
that labor organizing was
acceptable on the workers' own
time.
Political activism and labor
organizing have in the past been
acceptable according to the
administration as long as it is on
the workers' own time. Why is the
administration violating its own
principles in the case of John
Keilch?
John Keilch is a man that most

of the workers in the Main
Library know. He has been active
in politics for several years.
"Last summer Lyman's gang
said that leaflets put up by
workers' organizations were
"unauthorized" and couldn't be
posted on the kiosks. In the fall,
they brought in the NLRB to
divert the employees movement
into a company union. Now they
figure that if they isolate one
employee and punish him, then
other workers will become afraid.
The workers will avoid becoming
active against the war or against
the administration undercutting
our living standards so that more
buildings can be built," stated
Keilch.
