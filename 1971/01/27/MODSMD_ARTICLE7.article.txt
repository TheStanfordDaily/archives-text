# Ehrlich — Just Selection

In a column which appeared in the Daily last
Thursday, a member of the National Lawyer's
Guild, Peter Goldscheider, attacked the selection
of Thomas Ehrlich as the new Dean of the Law
School. Focussing on his international law
background, the column indicted Prof. Ehrlich on
several counts: his appointment had been
"sneaked" over (apparently announced during the
Lodge incident to cover the complicity); his
selection will assure the large corporations of their
continued dominant exploitative positions; his
background in the new position will help to foster
international imperialist adventures.
First, it is worthwhile to review the history of
the selection process from which Prof. Ehrlich's
appointment emerged. The Dean Selection
Committee included two law students with full
votes and equal standing with the faculty
members. A meeting of all law students was held
and questionnaires were distributed to determine
criteria for the dean selection. At this point
opposition was voiced by some against Ehrlish,
rumored to have the inside track, and against any
candidate from the corporate or international law
field. Significantly, the response from the students
indicated, besides a large measure of apathy, that
the area of specialization was not deemed very
relevant. The subsequent choice of Prof. Ehrlich
was made without Committee dissent.
The most that can be said against the selection
process is that the choice was made in an open
manner which enabled any opposition to muster
what support it could. No doubt the same
acceptance would have greeted an appointment
from a different field.
The second and third counts of the indictment
likewise miss the mark, but do raise subsidiary
Issues more difficult to dispose of. It is alleged that
the Ehrlich tenure will promote corporate

exploitation and will encourage an Imperialist
Empire abroad. Both charges stem from an
outdated analysis of the ecnomic system - an
analysis made by Proudhon in 1 846 and expanded
by Marx in 1 8 67. Yet the analysis is freely bandied
about today without revision or discrimination,
without any accounting for the development of a
system which permits simultaneous accumulation
of physical property and a widening dispersion of
wealth. Reforms in the system are necessary - but
they are reforms more on the order of Nader's
"Campaign GM," than the revolutionary turning
to a Marxist system that has proven itself to be less
kindly, less evolutionary, less capable of
innovation and less free than the "capitalist"
system.
As for the International Empire argument, one
need only point out that indoctrination in 19 th
Century Imperialism is not the function of Prof.
Ehrlich's or any other Stanford law professor's
class. To the contrary, the international
curriculum places stress on those cooperative
arrangements—the International Monetary Fund,
the Seabed Treaty, the UN—which seek
stabilization and growth, particularly for Third
World countries. It would be instructive for those
who have not done so to attend one of Prof.
Ehrlich's sessions on Cambodia and Vietnam.
But more important, the issues raised out of
context by Mr. Goldscheider's analysis are indeed
the issues to which this Law School and similar
institutions must respond: legal justice for the
poor and the activist, enforcement of corporate
responsibility, overhaul of the courts and penal
institutions, legislation for the environment, good
planning in foreign policy. The quality of the
response which is elicited will serve as the proper
measure of the School and its leadership.
