# Street People Enjoy The Life Of Leisure
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Whenever the sun shines in Palo
Alto, Ronald and Ernie come to
spend the afternoon at Lytton
Plaza.
They've done it for three years
now and say they expect to do it
for three more. Ronald and Ernie
are street people, without a job,
with no money and digging it.
Dressed in a fringed jacket, a
cowboy hat and what he calls
''shit-kicking'' boots,
Ronald-from-Marin leads a'n
unhurried, unworried life that is
typical of dozens of young street
people who live in and around Palo
Alto.
"I come to Lytton Plaza," he
lazily explained, "because there's
nothing else to do. I'm broke and I
don't want to work because its too
much fun just doing this."
Candlemaking, dope dealing, and
stealing from locH stores keep as
many as 1 000 young wanderers alive
from week to week in the Stanford
area. The number of street people
has mushroomed from a few hard
core bums in the early sixties. Now
all ages of people and all walks of
life are represented in the group.
Improvise Adulthood
In his book The Making of a
Counter Culture, Theodore Rozak
attributes the rising number of
street people to the attitude of
many young people towards work.
"They have been left too long
without any taste for the rigidities
that adulthood is supposed to be all
about," Rozak writes. "They
continue to assert pleasure and
freedom as human rights and
improvise their own idea of
adulthood."
The Palo Alto Police have a little
different explanation for the rise of
the street people. "We no longer

have the vagrancy laws," Community
Relations Officer A 1 Bowra explains.
"So now its not against the law to
walk around the streets with no
money in your pockets like it used
to be."
Still another theory about the
floursihing street culture comes from
the New York Times. "Universities,"
the Times say, "provide the fertile
soil for the street cultures. The
street people are able to live
cheaply, obtain and sell drugs, and
generally avoid being hassled by the
straight society."
Not Hassled
All three explanations seem to fit
the general attitudes of local street
people. A warm day on White Plaza
will produce half a dozen "young
incorrigibles" sitting with "no
money in their pockets" who appear
not be be "hassled" by anyone.
One brother-sister team of jewelry
peddlers on the Plaza last week
explained their reasons for being
street people. "We sit out in the
sun all day, having a good time and
selling enough stuff to live on," the
girl said. "I really enjoy the life."
The University policy towards the
hip entreprenuers has so far been
one of a capitalistic grandmother.
"The enterprises are an interesting
thing to have on campus," Bill
Stone of the dean of students office
laughed. "We've had no complaints
about them and wouldn't mind if
the place turned into a sort c-f
Hyde Park or something like it for
the students."
Dealing Drugs
Some street people however,
would probably not get the same
warm reception from the
administration. Some of the local
streeters live off the profits they
reap from dealing drugs on campus.
"I can come on the campus for one

night," one dealer said, "and make
enough to keep me going two
weeks."
While the street people generally
are careful to keep out of the way
of police, occasional brushes with
the law occur, most often when a
street man decides to crash in a
local park or automobile. "They're
usually more than happy to move
along if we find them sacked out

somewhere they shouldn't be," said
Lieutenant Bowra, "or sometimes
we'll let 'em spend a night in jail
courtesy of the Department."
Being contained overnight in a
jailhouse for sleeping in a park is
about as far as most of the street
people take their political sacrifices
and involvement.
A Berkeley psychologist, Dr.

David Whittacker, observed that for
the most part, Berkeley's street
people are "alienated, agnostic, and
very important in terms of political
rallies but not disciplined enough to
follow up the initial confrontation
with any sustained political
activism."
Bowra said his Palo Alto's
problems with the street people
centered around '\he kids who,

according to the law, are leading
idle, immoral, or dissolute lives."
The threat of being idle,
immoral, and dissolute is a problem
that the street people can surely
handle. As one candle salesgirl in
White Plaza explained, "I'm here in
Palo Alto to rest. I figure I can get
everything I want by just selling
candles."

TAKIN IT EASY—Two enterprizing hip capitalists soak up the sun in White Plaza. With free rent, your own hours, and bourgeois University students, who can't help
but enjoy the work?

the New York Times. "Universities,"
the Times say, "provide the fertile
soil for the street cultures. The
street people are able to live
cheaply, obtain and sell drugs, and
generally avoid being hassled by the
straight society."
Not Hassled
All three explanations seem to fit
the general attitudes of local street
people. A warm day on White Plaza
will produce half a dozen "young
incorrigibles" sitting with "no
money in their pockets" who appear
not be be "hassled" by anyone.
One brother-sister team of jewelry
peddlers on the Plaza last week
explained their reasons for being
street people. "We sit out in the
sun all day, having a good time and
selling enough stuff to live on," the
girl said. "I really enjoy the life."
The University policy towards the
hip entreprenuers has so far been
one of a capitalistic grandmother.
"The enterprises are an interesting
thing to have on campus," Bill
Stone of the dean of students office
laughed. "We've had no complaints
about them and wouldn't mind if
the place turned into a sort c-f
Hyde Park or something like it for
the students."
Dealing Drugs
Some street people however,
would probably not get the same
warm reception from the
administration. Some of the local
streeters live off the profits they
reap from dealing drugs on campus.
"I can come on the campus for one

night," one dealer said, "and make
enough to keep me going two
weeks."
While the street people generally
are careful to keep out of the way
of police, occasional brushes with
the law occur, most often when a
street man decides to crash in a
local park or automobile. "They're
usually more than happy to move
along if we find them sacked out

somewhere they shouldn't be," said
Lieutenant Bowra, "or sometimes
we'll let 'em spend a night in jail
courtesy of the Department."
Being contained overnight in a
jailhouse for sleeping in a park is
about as far as most of the street
people take their political sacrifices
and involvement.
A Berkeley psychologist, Dr.

David Whittacker, observed that for
the most part, Berkeley's street
people are "alienated, agnostic, and
very important in terms of political
rallies but not disciplined enough to
follow up the initial confrontation
with any sustained political
activism."
Bowra said his Palo Alto's
problems with the street people
centered around '\he kids who,

according to the law, are leading
idle, immoral, or dissolute lives."
The threat of being idle,
immoral, and dissolute is a problem
that the street people can surely
handle. As one candle salesgirl in
White Plaza explained, "I'm here in
Palo Alto to rest. I figure I can get
everything I want by just selling
candles."

TAKIN IT EASY—Two enterprizing hip capitalists soak up the sun in White Plaza. With free rent, your own hours, and bourgeois University students, who can't help
but enjoy the work?
Whenever the sun shines in Palo
Alto, Ronald and Ernie come to
spend the afternoon at Lytton
Plaza.
They've done it for three years
now and say they expect to do it
for three more. Ronald and Ernie
are street people, without a job,
with no money and digging it.
Dressed in a fringed jacket, a
cowboy hat and what he calls
''shit-kicking'' boots,
Ronald-from-Marin leads a'n
unhurried, unworried life that is
typical of dozens of young street
people who live in and around Palo
Alto.
"I come to Lytton Plaza," he
lazily explained, "because there's
nothing else to do. I'm broke and I
don't want to work because its too
much fun just doing this."
Candlemaking, dope dealing, and
stealing from locH stores keep as
many as 1 000 young wanderers alive
from week to week in the Stanford
area. The number of street people
has mushroomed from a few hard
core bums in the early sixties. Now
all ages of people and all walks of
life are represented in the group.
Improvise Adulthood
In his book The Making of a
Counter Culture, Theodore Rozak
attributes the rising number of
street people to the attitude of
many young people towards work.
"They have been left too long
without any taste for the rigidities
that adulthood is supposed to be all
about," Rozak writes. "They
continue to assert pleasure and
freedom as human rights and
improvise their own idea of
adulthood."
The Palo Alto Police have a little
different explanation for the rise of
the street people. "We no longer

have the vagrancy laws," Community
Relations Officer A 1 Bowra explains.
"So now its not against the law to
walk around the streets with no
money in your pockets like it used
to be."

jailhouse for sleeping in a park is
about as far as most of the street
people take their political sacrifices
and involvement.
A Berkeley psychologist, Dr.

David Whittacker, observed that for
the most part, Berkeley's street
people are "alienated, agnostic, and
very important in terms of political
rallies but not disciplined enough to
follow up the initial confrontation
with any sustained political
activism."
Bowra said his Palo Alto's
problems with the street people
centered around '\he kids who,

according to the law, are leading
idle, immoral, or dissolute lives."
The threat of being idle,
immoral, and dissolute is a problem
that the street people can surely
handle. As one candle salesgirl in
White Plaza explained, "I'm here in
Palo Alto to rest. I figure I can get
everything I want by just selling
candles."

TAKIN IT EASY—Two enterprizing hip capitalists soak up the sun in White Plaza. With free rent, your own hours, and bourgeois University students, who can't help
but enjoy the work?
Whenever the sun shines in Palo
Alto, Ronald and Ernie come to
spend the afternoon at Lytton
Plaza.
They've done it for three years
now and say they expect to do it
for three more. Ronald and Ernie
are street people, without a job,
with no money and digging it.
Dressed in a fringed jacket, a
cowboy hat and what he calls
''shit-kicking'' boots,
Ronald-from-Marin leads a'n
unhurried, unworried life that is
typical of dozens of young street
people who live in and around Palo
Alto.
"I come to Lytton Plaza," he
lazily explained, "because there's
nothing else to do. I'm broke and I
don't want to work because its too
much fun just doing this."
Candlemaking, dope dealing, and
stealing from locH stores keep as
many as 1 000 young wanderers alive
from week to week in the Stanford
area. The number of street people
has mushroomed from a few hard
core bums in the early sixties. Now
all ages of people and all walks of
life are represented in the group.
Improvise Adulthood
In his book The Making of a
Counter Culture, Theodore Rozak
attributes the rising number of
street people to the attitude of
many young people towards work.
"They have been left too long
without any taste for the rigidities
that adulthood is supposed to be all
about," Rozak writes. "They
continue to assert pleasure and
freedom as human rights and
improvise their own idea of
adulthood."
The Palo Alto Police have a little
different explanation for the rise of
the street people. "We no longer

have the vagrancy laws," Community
Relations Officer A 1 Bowra explains.
"So now its not against the law to
walk around the streets with no
money in your pockets like it used
to be."
Still another theory about the
floursihing street culture comes from
the New York Times. "Universities,"
the Times say, "provide the fertile
soil for the street cultures. The
street people are able to live
cheaply, obtain and sell drugs, and
generally avoid being hassled by the
straight society."
Not Hassled
All three explanations seem to fit
the general attitudes of local street
people. A warm day on White Plaza
will produce half a dozen "young
incorrigibles" sitting with "no
money in their pockets" who appear
not be be "hassled" by anyone.
One brother-sister team of jewelry
peddlers on the Plaza last week
explained their reasons for being
street people. "We sit out in the
sun all day, having a good time and
selling enough stuff to live on," the
girl said. "I really enjoy the life."
The University policy towards the
hip entreprenuers has so far been
one of a capitalistic grandmother.
"The enterprises are an interesting
thing to have on campus," Bill
Stone of the dean of students office
laughed. "We've had no complaints
about them and wouldn't mind if
the place turned into a sort c-f
Hyde Park or something like it for
the students."
Dealing Drugs
Some street people however,
would probably not get the same
warm reception from the
administration. Some of the local
streeters live off the profits they
reap from dealing drugs on campus.
"I can come on the campus for one

night," one dealer said, "and make
enough to keep me going two
weeks."
While the street people generally
are careful to keep out of the way
of police, occasional brushes with
the law occur, most often when a
street man decides to crash in a
local park or automobile. "They're
usually more than happy to move
along if we find them sacked out

somewhere they shouldn't be," said
Lieutenant Bowra, "or sometimes
we'll let 'em spend a night in jail
