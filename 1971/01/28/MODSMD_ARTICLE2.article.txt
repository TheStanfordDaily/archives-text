# Lyman To Seek Franklin's Supension, Will Press Advisory Board Charges
## 
### ED KOHN 
President Richard W. Lyman
yesterday informed Associate
Professor H. Bruce Franklin that he
will seek to suspend the noted
Melville scholar from his
"professorial duties" for one
academic term in response to
Franklin's alleged role in the Henry
Cabot Lodge speech disruption Jan.
11.
Lyman also denied Franklin's
request for a hearing before the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC),
telling him that he would have a
hearing before the Advisory Board
of the Academic Council. Franklin
had no immediate comment on
Lyman's response, which was
contained in a letter. After pleading
"not guilty" to charges to assult
and battery on a police officer and

resisting arrest in Redwood City
Tuesday, Franklin returned to a
standing room only classroom
yesterday afternoon. The Redwood
City charges stem from a
demonstration at Stanford Research
Institute Jan. 20.
The Daily was given a copy of
Lyman's letter yesterday.
"I would propose that you be
suspended from all of your
professorial duties for the quarter
succeeding resolution of this matter
(summer quarter excluded), such
suspension to be without pay," he
wrote.
Anticipated Earnings
"In order to avoid acute financial
hardship during the period of your
suspension, I would propose that
you may have your anticipated
earnings for the next 24 months
following the beginning of your
suspension pro-rated with payments
to begin with the period of
suspension.
"Because this penalty, should it
be imposed, includes a
discriminatory reduction in your
salary, it could only be assessed
after opportunity for a hearing at
the Advisory Board of the Academic
Council."
Replying to Franklin's request for
an SJC hearing, made during an
open-air press conference last week
* * *

in front of the President's Office
(Bldg. 10), Lyman wrote:
"I agree with you that you have
a right to a formal hearing on the
charges before any penalty is
assessed. I treat your written
response as an expression of your
wish to exercise that right. I intend,
therefore, in due course to have
formal charges drawn and submitted
to the Chairman of the Advisory
Board pursuant to Paragraph 15 of
the 'Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure.'
"You will, pursuant to these
proceedings, receive a copy of those
charges."
Not To SJC
In the complex two and a half
page letter Lyman explained in
detail why he believes that there is
"no possibility" of sending
Franklin's case to the SJC, where
eight students will be tried tonight
on similar disruption charges.
"That Charter (the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, to which
Franklin referred in a written
statement he forwarded to the
President) explicitly limits the
jurisdiction of the Stanford Judicial
Council to 'student disciplinary
cases,' " Lyman wrote.
"On Nov. 19, 1970, the Senate
acted again on the subject of
faculty discipline. It received and
approved a report based on the
* * *

Task Force on Community
Self-Discipline which says of the
19 68 Senate action, 'Subsequent
efforts of the (Committee of
Fifteen) to write the amendments of
the Charter of 1968 incorporating
the intent of the faculty Senate
resolution have not been successful.'
The Charter was adopted by the
three major constituencies of the
University and can be amended only
by agreement of all three."
Cancelled Speech
Lyman also reiterated, in detail,
the charges against Franklin.
" ... You are, as stated in my
original letter, charged with
deliberately contributing to the
disturbance which forced the
cancellation of the speech scheduled
to be given at Dinkelspiel on Jan.
11, 1971, by Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge.
"... It is an offense that strikes
at the University's obligation to
maintain itself as an open forum.
That is an obligation that overrides
even the most strongly felt outrage
by any part of the community. It
Is, to put the matter bluntly, an
obligation that has bound me to
support your freedom to speak out,
even in the face of the outrage that
your speech on occasion provokes."
Franklin said he would comment
on the letter after he had sufficient
time to study its contents.

had no immediate comment on
Lyman's response, which was
contained in a letter. After pleading
"not guilty" to charges to assult
and battery on a police officer and

resisting arrest in Redwood City
Tuesday, Franklin returned to a
standing room only classroom
yesterday afternoon. The Redwood
City charges stem from a
demonstration at Stanford Research
Institute Jan. 20.
The Daily was given a copy of
Lyman's letter yesterday.
"I would propose that you be
suspended from all of your
professorial duties for the quarter
succeeding resolution of this matter
(summer quarter excluded), such
suspension to be without pay," he
wrote.
Anticipated Earnings
"In order to avoid acute financial
hardship during the period of your
suspension, I would propose that
you may have your anticipated
earnings for the next 24 months
following the beginning of your
suspension pro-rated with payments
to begin with the period of
suspension.
"Because this penalty, should it
be imposed, includes a
discriminatory reduction in your
salary, it could only be assessed
after opportunity for a hearing at
the Advisory Board of the Academic
Council."
Replying to Franklin's request for
an SJC hearing, made during an
open-air press conference last week

in front of the President's Office
(Bldg. 10), Lyman wrote:
"I agree with you that you have
a right to a formal hearing on the
charges before any penalty is
assessed. I treat your written
response as an expression of your
wish to exercise that right. I intend,
therefore, in due course to have
formal charges drawn and submitted
to the Chairman of the Advisory
Board pursuant to Paragraph 15 of
the 'Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure.'
"You will, pursuant to these
proceedings, receive a copy of those
charges."
Not To SJC
In the complex two and a half
page letter Lyman explained in
detail why he believes that there is
"no possibility" of sending
Franklin's case to the SJC, where
eight students will be tried tonight
on similar disruption charges.
"That Charter (the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, to which
Franklin referred in a written
statement he forwarded to the
President) explicitly limits the
jurisdiction of the Stanford Judicial
Council to 'student disciplinary
cases,' " Lyman wrote.
"On Nov. 19, 1970, the Senate
acted again on the subject of
faculty discipline. It received and
approved a report based on the
* * *

Task Force on Community
Self-Discipline which says of the
19 68 Senate action, 'Subsequent
efforts of the (Committee of
Fifteen) to write the amendments of
the Charter of 1968 incorporating
the intent of the faculty Senate
resolution have not been successful.'
The Charter was adopted by the
three major constituencies of the
University and can be amended only
by agreement of all three."
Cancelled Speech
Lyman also reiterated, in detail,
the charges against Franklin.
" ... You are, as stated in my
original letter, charged with
deliberately contributing to the
disturbance which forced the
cancellation of the speech scheduled
to be given at Dinkelspiel on Jan.
11, 1971, by Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge.
"... It is an offense that strikes
at the University's obligation to
maintain itself as an open forum.
That is an obligation that overrides
even the most strongly felt outrage
by any part of the community. It
Is, to put the matter bluntly, an
obligation that has bound me to
support your freedom to speak out,
even in the face of the outrage that
your speech on occasion provokes."
Franklin said he would comment
on the letter after he had sufficient
time to study its contents.
