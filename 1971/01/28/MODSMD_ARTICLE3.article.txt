# Stennis Hints Future Need For Cambodia Escalation
## 
### 
WASHINGTON - North Vietnamese
military successes in Cambodia could
lead to expansion of U.S.
involvement there, the chairman of
the Senate Armed Services
Committee said yesterday.
But this is not the case now,
and the war is going well, Sen.
John Stennis told newsmen after a
secret briefing by Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird.

The Mississippi Democrat added
that the present congressional ban
on ground troops in Cambodia may
need re-examining.
Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D.,
who has backed total withdrawal
from Vietnam, criticized Stennis's
statement this way:
"Very frankly any senator who
talks about sending American forces
into Cambodia, ought to lead the
charge himself."

Laird insisted that the language
and intent of the ban the
Cooper-Church amendment are being
respected but declined to submit to
extended questioning by newsmen.
Sen. Stuart Symington, (D-M0.,)
said Laird's account was optimistic,
but that his impression is "we have
gone further than we understood
from the statements of President
Nixon June 30th."
Nixon said then U.S. airpower
would be used only to interdict
North Vietnamese supply lines in
Gimbodia leading to South Vietnam
and that there would be no air or
logistics support for South
Vietnamese operations in Cambodia.
Stennis was asked if the United
States would need air controllers on
the ground to control air striKes.
"Well, that's been a great big
point with me as to how far we
could go without having plenty of
our own air controllers. We'll have
to see what develops. The margin is
rather thin ..."
Would ground troops be needed
to protect men delivering aid
supplies and equipment to
Cambodia?
"We don't have them there now,
and there are no plans to put them
there. If this thing thickens up, I
don'l know what may become
necessary."
Some peace leaders on Capitol
Mill have again proposed legislation
to require withdrawal of all U.S.
troops from Indochina by the end
of this year.
