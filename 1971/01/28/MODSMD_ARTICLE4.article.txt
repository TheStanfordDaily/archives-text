# Lodge Protesters Before SJC Tonight
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Judicial proceedings will begin
tonight for the eight students
charged with disrupting a scheduled
speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Ixidge here Jan. 11.
The accused said in a release
yesterday that they plan to present
a common defense and have asked
for "a hearing open to the entire
community." They also made public
their names for the first time.
The eight also said they still
consider John Keilch, a suspended
University library employee, and
Assoc. Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
fellow co-defendants before the
nine-man Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC).
SJC charges against Keilch were

dropped when it was learned he is
not a student. Prof. Franklin's case
is scheduled to be heard before the
Academic Council Advisory Board,
the judicial board of the faculty
with power to cut faculty pay and
dismiss tenured faculty members.
The SJC hearings, scheduled to
begin at 7:30 tonight in the Moot
Courtroom of the Law School, are
expected to run until Saturday
afternoon.
Disruption Policy
The accused have been cited with
violation of the University campus
disruption policy which states, "It is
a violation of University policy for
a member of the faculty, staff, or
student body to disrupt the
policy. Exactly what the results of such
a charge would be, and which body
would have the right to hear Franklin's
case in this instance, is a point of
dispute.
If the Faculty Senate resolution of
15*68 had been incorporated into the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, and
therefore into the charter of the SJC,
the case could be heard before the SJC.
However, this resolution, and the intent
it conveys, have never been
incorporated into the Charter. This
leaves the SJC's position ambiguous.
Although its charge, as now worded,
gives if jurisdiction only over students,
the SJC might interpret its present
charge broadly, and decide that it did
have jurisdiction over faculty members
in cases of alleged violation of the
disruption policy. If it did so, it would
be possible for the Franklin case to be
brought before it. This is what Franklin
requested at an emotional press
conference last week — that his case be
heard by the SJC, along with the cases
of students charged with disruption
following the Lodge demonstration.
If the case were heard before the
SJC, panalties such as a salary cut or
dismissal could not be recommended or
levied, for the same reason that Lyman
himself could not arbitrarily levy them.
The Appointment and Tenure
Statement specifies only the Advisory
Board as the body who can approve
such penalties.

Students now fating a hearing
before the SJC are subject to a range of
penalties which includes suspension,
fine, or expulsion. Should Franklin be
tried before the same body, the range
of penalties he could face would be
much smaller, with censure being
perhaps the severest penalty the SJC
could recommend.
The dispute then, is whether he
should be tried before the same
tribunal, or be faced with the same
range of penalties as students who are
charged with similar actions. Lyman
chose the course by which Franklin
would be faced with the same range of
penalties, and thus gave him the
opportunity of a hearing only by the
Advisory Board.

tribunal, or be faced with the same
range of penalties as students who are
charged with similar actions. Lyman
chose the course by which Franklin
would be faced with the same range of
penalties, and thus gave him the
opportunity of a hearing only by the
Advisory Board.
Judicial proceedings will begin
tonight for the eight students
charged with disrupting a scheduled
speech by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Ixidge here Jan. 11.
The accused said in a release
yesterday that they plan to present
a common defense and have asked
for "a hearing open to the entire
community." They also made public
their names for the first time.
The eight also said they still
consider John Keilch, a suspended
University library employee, and
Assoc. Prof. H. Bruce Franklin
fellow co-defendants before the
nine-man Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC).
SJC charges against Keilch were

dropped when it was learned he is
not a student. Prof. Franklin's case
is scheduled to be heard before the
Academic Council Advisory Board,
the judicial board of the faculty
with power to cut faculty pay and
dismiss tenured faculty members.
The SJC hearings, scheduled to
begin at 7:30 tonight in the Moot
Courtroom of the Law School, are
expected to run until Saturday
afternoon.
Disruption Policy
The accused have been cited with
violation of the University campus
disruption policy which states, "It is
a violation of University policy for
a member of the faculty, staff, or
student body to disrupt the
policy. Exactly what the results of such
a charge would be, and which body
would have the right to hear Franklin's
case in this instance, is a point of
dispute.
If the Faculty Senate resolution of
15*68 had been incorporated into the
Legislative and Judicial Charter, and
therefore into the charter of the SJC,
the case could be heard before the SJC.
However, this resolution, and the intent
it conveys, have never been
incorporated into the Charter. This
leaves the SJC's position ambiguous.
Although its charge, as now worded,
gives if jurisdiction only over students,
the SJC might interpret its present
charge broadly, and decide that it did
have jurisdiction over faculty members
in cases of alleged violation of the
disruption policy. If it did so, it would
be possible for the Franklin case to be
brought before it. This is what Franklin
requested at an emotional press
conference last week — that his case be
heard by the SJC, along with the cases
of students charged with disruption
following the Lodge demonstration.
If the case were heard before the
SJC, panalties such as a salary cut or
dismissal could not be recommended or
levied, for the same reason that Lyman
himself could not arbitrarily levy them.
The Appointment and Tenure
Statement specifies only the Advisory
Board as the body who can approve
such penalties.

Students now fating a hearing
before the SJC are subject to a range of
penalties which includes suspension,
fine, or expulsion. Should Franklin be
tried before the same body, the range
of penalties he could face would be
much smaller, with censure being
perhaps the severest penalty the SJC
could recommend.
The dispute then, is whether he
should be tried before the same
tribunal, or be faced with the same
range of penalties as students who are
charged with similar actions. Lyman
chose the course by which Franklin
would be faced with the same range of
penalties, and thus gave him the
