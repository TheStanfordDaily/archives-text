# President's Three Options
## Franklin Case Raises Questions 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
After years of espousing causes,
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
is rapidly becoming a cause himself.
No-one is sure, however, exactly
how inflammatory an issue
Franklin's case may become. The
answer is hidden in a maze of
conflicting documents, confused
interpretation and disparate opinions
as to the relative importance of
these documents.
The documents are these:
—The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure, passed by
the Academic Council in 1 967 and
approved by the Board of Trustees
and the American Association of
University professors (AAUP).
—The Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 19 68, passed by the
Administration, faculty and students
of Stanford University, under which
the Stanford Judicial Council
operates.
—A resolution passed in October,
19fiH, by the Faculty Senate, which

recommends giving the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) jurisdiction
over faculty members in cases when
the faculty member is charged with
a violation of the Campus
Disruption Policy.
Appointment and Tenure Violation
Following Franklin's alleged
disruption of Henry Cabot Lodge's
address two weeks ago, President
Richard Lyman wrote him a
confidential letter, advising him that

News Analysis

he was being charged, under
Paragraph 3 of the Appointment
and Tenure statement, with
"personal conduct substantially
impairing . . . performance of his
appropriate function within the
University."
Charging Franklin with a violation
under the regulations of the

Appointment and Tenure statement
was one of three courses Lyman could
have followed. He might have dealt
with the matter in his capacity as
President, calling Franklin before him
and personally reprimanding him for
his alleged conduct. Lyman could not
however have arbitrarily imposed such
penalties as a salary cut or dismissal of
Franklin.
He could also have followed the
course he has taken, charging Franklin
under the clauses of the Appointment
and Tenure statement. This course gives
Franklin the opportunity to request a
hearing before the Advisory Board, a
body composed of five faculty
members and elected annually by the
faculty. This group has final power to
appoint, promote, and discipline
faculty members, armed with a full
range of penalties, naming from
reprimand to dismissal.
The third course possibly open to
Lyman was to charge Franklin with a
violation of the campus disruption
effective carrying out of a
University function or approved
activity, such as lectures,
meetings..."
But the accused said in
yesterday's release, "We reject any
idea that Stanford has a right to sec
up any court to judge our actions
in opposition to Stanford's policies.
If we are to be judged, it should
be by the most oppressed peoples
of the world."
The students charged with
disruption of the Jan. 11 speech
here are: Brad Dewden, graduate
student, philosophy; Gerry Foote,
sophomore, general studies; Mike
Helman, sophomore, general studies;
Merle Rabine, graduate student,
English; Teresa Ramirez, sophomore,
general studies; Skip Slade, graduate
student, English; Janet Weiss,
graduate student, English; and Jeff
Youdelman, graduate student,
English.
Charges were dropped against a
ninth student when identification
problems arose.
Should they be found guilty

penalties against the eight range
from censure to expulsion.
The defendants have led a series
of discussions about the
controversial Lodge speech all week.
The defendants went into dorms
Monday and Tuesday night after
dinner, and last night held a panel
discussion in the Junipero lounge
before about 30 people.
A rally is planned for noon
today in White Plaza. Speakers have
been scheduled for Room 214,
History Corner, at 7 tonight, half
an hour before the hearings are
scheduled to begin.
Defendant Merle Rabine, looking
ahead to the trial, said last night in
a KZSU interview that he hoped
the defendants "will be able to
bring a lot of important relevant
information on why the
demonstration took place into the
trial at the beginning."
The Stanford Judicial Council
consists of five faculty members and
four students. It was formed as a
result of an Old Union sit-in in the
spring of 1 968 called to protest the
University's judicial procedures.
