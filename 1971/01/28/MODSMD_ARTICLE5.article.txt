# President's Three Options
## Franklin Case Raises Questions 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
After years of espousing causes,
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
is rapidly becoming a cause himself.
No-one is sure, however, exactly
how inflammatory an issue
Franklin's case may become. The
answer is hidden in a maze of
conflicting documents, confused
interpretation and disparate opinions
as to the relative importance of
these documents.
The documents are these:
—The Statement of Policy on
Appointment and Tenure, passed by
the Academic Council in 1 967 and
approved by the Board of Trustees
and the American Association of
University professors (AAUP).
—The Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 19 68, passed by the
Administration, faculty and students
of Stanford University, under which
the Stanford Judicial Council
operates.
—A resolution passed in October,
19fiH, by the Faculty Senate, which

recommends giving the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) jurisdiction
over faculty members in cases when
the faculty member is charged with
a violation of the Campus
Disruption Policy.

Richard Lyman wrote him a
confidential letter, advising him that

he was being charged, under
Paragraph 3 of the Appointment
and Tenure statement, with
"personal conduct substantially
impairing . . . performance of his
appropriate function within the
University."
Charging Franklin with a violation
under the regulations of the

Appointment and Tenure statement
was one of three courses Lyman could
have followed. He might have dealt
with the matter in his capacity as
President, calling Franklin before him
and personally reprimanding him for
his alleged conduct. Lyman could not
however have arbitrarily imposed such
penalties as a salary cut or dismissal of
Franklin.
He could also have followed the
course he has taken, charging Franklin
under the clauses of the Appointment
and Tenure statement. This course gives
Franklin the opportunity to request a
hearing before the Advisory Board, a
body composed of five faculty
members and elected annually by the
faculty. This group has final power to
appoint, promote, and discipline
faculty members, armed with a full
range of penalties, naming from
reprimand to dismissal.
The third course possibly open to
Lyman was to charge Franklin with a
violation of the campus disruption
