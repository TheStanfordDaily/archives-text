## Radical Tour Of Chinatown 
###

It seems somehow ironic
that as millions of Chinese are
celebrating the New Year all
over the world, even the
people of Chinatown seem to
find some reason for joy and
celebration.
And the tourists getting
drunk this weekend, boozing it
up in Chinatown where they
expect the usual gaiety, will
not be disappointed. And the
members of the Asian-American
Student Alliance will expouse
their rhetorical radicalism, also
getting inebriated with
" self-identity" and a
directionless, redundant hatred
for the white honkies.
But the sad thing Ls that,
whether stoned on screaming
racism at the white man, or
walking down Chinatown,
sophisticatedly contemptuous of
"chinks," the bourgeois yellow
or white man - the Stanford
Asia n-American with his
yin-yang badge or WASP jock
with his dolly - will pass the
new year lost in their own
little worlds, grandly fooling
themselves in their own
fantasies.
It is rather sad that
Stanford Asian-American
radicals find it difficult to
avoid becoming elitist and
bourgeois visionaries. One hears
an occassional accusation of
racism from the AASA
headquarters, and it is the chic
thing now to be angry young
Asian-Americans, bitter at the
generations of "covert and
overt racism" the white man
has practised on the yellow
man, and proud of one's
ancient heritage, too often
expressed in Chopsticks and
kimonos and calligraphy and
Tang poems, and other
externalities of the exotic East.
It seems almost "in" to be an
angry, oppressed
Asian-American.
But while Stanford
Asian-American radicals vent
their anger and define "overt
and covert racism," and
discover their identity and
heritage within the pastoral
confines of the Farm, there
happens to be many thousands
of Asian-Americans outside of
the idyllic, elitist institution,
who are young and old, and
don't really care if racism is
covert or overt, sophisticated or
blatant, if they can break
through the very real results of
racism: poverty, malnutrition,
poor education, unemployment,
and the incredibly depressing
realization that one is caught
in a vicious cycle that may
have no end.
Many Stanford
Asian-Americans are children of
those who have made it, who
are now enjoying economic
equitability with middle-class
whites. Understandably, the
children may be bitter at the
cop-out, of the so-called "myth
of assimilation" that their
parents had to accept in order
to achieve economic parity
with bourgeois whites. But like
too many members of the
affluent generation, they are
perhaps too long on theoretical
anger and intellectual racism,
and too short on the realities
of suffering and poverty.
A few days ago I went to
visit a Chinese widow with
three children, whom my father
had known in Indonesia a long
time ago. She emigrated here,
and in the classic way, started
her own Chinese restaurant in
San Mateo. She is the cook,
waitress and proprietor of the
restaurant, which is not very
good and serves mainly
working-class whites. It is a
difficult life, and in her daily
experiences she knows what
discrimination means, what

loneliness and alienation and
hardship is.
I do not mean to glorify
her. I do not think it right
that she should continue to
suffer this hardship if it be
due to discrimination, that she
should be obsequious to her
patrons. But her suffering is
the reality of being
Asian-American, and it is only
through an identification and
involvement with people like
her that the Stanford
Asian-Americans can find a real
pride in being who they are.
There are many thousands
of poor Asian-Americans here,
not only in Chinatown, but in
Mountain View and San Mateo,
and on the fringes of this
institution. There is no reason
that AASA members and other
Asian-Americans cannot be
active in programs to
consolidate the mass of
working-class Asian-Americans,
increasing their consciousness of
unity, organizing an end to
discrimination, asserting their
racial equality, tutoring and
instilling in their children a
pride in being yellow when the
tough kids in school laugh at
you for being a chink, and
giving a sense of community

among Asian-Americans that is
borne of happiness and not
necessity and fear.
With a working budget of
four thousand dollars, I don't
understand why nothing has
been organized, beyond many
radical epithets. Anger that is
neither constructive nor
destructive, but somewhat
empty, is even pathetic.
Many Stanford students,
perhaps Asian-Americans most
of all, would benefit from a
radical tour of Chinatown: not
a traditional exploitative tourist
tour, but one that would
expose the realities of the
living and working conditions,
and instead of seeing a lion
dance, listening to the
frustrations of the young and
poor. It would radicalize one's
life by forcing one to discard
the abstractions and actually
come into contact with that
which he has been abstracting
about. Too many
Asian-Americans, never having
been in or having risen from
the tenements of Chinatown,
have a non-involved,
exploitative tourist attitude. It
is necessary for the elite
Asian-Americans at Stanford to
identify with the actual victims
of discrimination, to help them

work, to help them fight, to
help them achieve the dignity
of equality and thereby achieve
one's identity at the same
time.
Chinese New Year will truly
be new and meaningful if the
people who celebrate it are not
the tourists glutting the place,
nor the radicals who shout
racism from the verdant
Stanford hills, but if the
waiters and cooks in the
Chinese restaurants can afford
to close shop for a day and
enjoy the New Year with their
family, not in ghettoes but
proper housing. And better yet,
if they can quit being waiters
and cooks and seamstresses and
be able to work in America on
their own terms, relying on the
experience of five thousand
years of suffering, wisdom and
dignity. Towards this end elitist
Asian-Americans can surely do
something.
