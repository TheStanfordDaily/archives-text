let women pay
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to comment on
a recent letter to the editor
regarding the idea that female
students should receive
obstetrical care when they
become pregnant.
Two things come
immediately to mind. 1.) Why
can't these women wait and
have their children later? 2.)
Why should all • students pay
for a service that only one
segment will be able to use
and could avoid through
contraceptive measures'.'
Living in a world in which
overpopulation is a critical
problem, having children can
not be justified as necessary to
preserve the species and if
anything may cause its demise.
Thus, those who elect not to
use contraception but to have
children are probably doing it
for personal reasons, e.g., moral
pressure, enjoyment of children,
et cetera. Whatever the reason
I feel it is unjust to expect
the rest of the Stanford
community to pay for one
individual's having children.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It's Friday today. A lot of
people are gone this week-end.
Some went to Yugoslavia, some
to Greece, to Germany, to
Czechoslovakia. Many of us are
staying here because we want
to see Berg's twelve-tone opera,
"Lulu," tonight at the
Staatsoper. We'll probably go
to a wine keller for some
Gluhwein afterwards.
All of this may not interest
you particularly, but somehow
it seemed a good way to start
— because that describes what
Vienna is to us. You see, we
read your article about our
campus (Thurs., Jan. 7). And
we read Professor Sokel's
response (Fri., Jan. 8). And it
seemed to us that something
was missing, that there was a
gap somewhere. The "Daily"
article stared at us with an

ominous headline, "Vienna
Campus May Shut," and a
stark, cold photograph of our,
to some extent, stark, cold
building. It talked a lot about
the decline in applications to
come here, and financial losses,
and the Austrian sub-committee
and their suggestions. Then
Professor Sokel wrote to
correct some false statements
made in the article. The
"Vienna debate" seemed to be
focussing on mechanics of the
Vienna Campus. But what the
Stanford undergraduate
undoubtedly wants to know
about is the essence of the
campus. What is there about
the Vienna Campus that makes
it worthwhile enough to be
retained — or undesirable
enough to be abolished?
Well, in the last few days
we've talked a lot here about
that question. Almost everyone
has something good to say
about the campus — and
something bad. People say all
kinds of things about being
here. They mention that beer
only costs 12c a bottle, that
the boys' bathroom upstairs has
a moldy floor, that the opera
is only 4 blocks away and
costs 60c, that the
washing-machine is insane. In
general, though, everyone agrees
on two things. First, although
certain improvements are
definitely needed, no one
regrets having come. Second,
the Vienna Campus offers
certain valuable opportunities
that no other Stanford Overseas
Campus has:
1. a true city-living experience
and the chance to get to know
a major European city
intimately — all the other

campuses are located in more
rural settings and no other is
in a capital city.
2. a literally infinite number of
things to do: opera, concerts,
plays, movies, shopping, wine
kellers, konditoreis, all within
walking distance of the campus
— at all the other campuses
major cultural centers are a
considerable distance away.
3. an excellent geographical
location as far as travel to
Southern or Eastern Europe is
concerned.
This is the side of the
Vienna campus we wanted you
to see, the "essence" that the
other articles seemed to
overlook. We wanted you to
understand that to abolish the
Vienna campus would be to
lose a great deal. Certainly this
campus is not perfect, but the
opportunities here for a
city-living experience, the
proximity to a wide range of
cultural events, and the chances
for easy travel to Southern and
Eastern Europe have been
invaluable to us — and we
wanted you to know.

Some went to Yugoslavia, some
to Greece, to Germany, to
Czechoslovakia. Many of us are
staying here because we want
to see Berg's twelve-tone opera,
"Lulu," tonight at the
Staatsoper. We'll probably go
to a wine keller for some
Gluhwein afterwards.
All of this may not interest
you particularly, but somehow
it seemed a good way to start
— because that describes what
Vienna is to us. You see, we
read your article about our
campus (Thurs., Jan. 7). And
we read Professor Sokel's
response (Fri., Jan. 8). And it
seemed to us that something
was missing, that there was a
gap somewhere. The "Daily"
article stared at us with an

ominous headline, "Vienna
Campus May Shut," and a
stark, cold photograph of our,
to some extent, stark, cold
building. It talked a lot about
the decline in applications to
come here, and financial losses,
and the Austrian sub-committee
and their suggestions. Then
Professor Sokel wrote to
correct some false statements
made in the article. The
"Vienna debate" seemed to be
focussing on mechanics of the
Vienna Campus. But what the
Stanford undergraduate
undoubtedly wants to know
about is the essence of the
campus. What is there about
the Vienna Campus that makes
it worthwhile enough to be
retained — or undesirable
enough to be abolished?
Well, in the last few days
we've talked a lot here about
that question. Almost everyone
has something good to say
about the campus — and
something bad. People say all
kinds of things about being
here. They mention that beer
only costs 12c a bottle, that
the boys' bathroom upstairs has
a moldy floor, that the opera
is only 4 blocks away and
costs 60c, that the
washing-machine is insane. In
general, though, everyone agrees
on two things. First, although
certain improvements are
definitely needed, no one
regrets having come. Second,
the Vienna Campus offers
certain valuable opportunities
that no other Stanford Overseas
Campus has:
1. a true city-living experience
and the chance to get to know
a major European city
intimately — all the other

campuses are located in more
rural settings and no other is
in a capital city.
2. a literally infinite number of
things to do: opera, concerts,
plays, movies, shopping, wine
kellers, konditoreis, all within
walking distance of the campus
— at all the other campuses
major cultural centers are a
considerable distance away.
3. an excellent geographical
location as far as travel to
Southern or Eastern Europe is
concerned.
This is the side of the
Vienna campus we wanted you
to see, the "essence" that the
other articles seemed to
overlook. We wanted you to
understand that to abolish the
Vienna campus would be to
lose a great deal. Certainly this
campus is not perfect, but the
opportunities here for a
city-living experience, the
proximity to a wide range of
cultural events, and the chances
for easy travel to Southern and
Eastern Europe have been
invaluable to us — and we

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to comment on
a recent letter to the editor
regarding the idea that female
students should receive
obstetrical care when they
become pregnant.
Two things come
immediately to mind. 1.) Why
can't these women wait and
have their children later? 2.)
Why should all • students pay
for a service that only one
segment will be able to use
and could avoid through
contraceptive measures'.'
Living in a world in which
overpopulation is a critical
problem, having children can
not be justified as necessary to
preserve the species and if
anything may cause its demise.
Thus, those who elect not to
use contraception but to have
children are probably doing it
for personal reasons, e.g., moral
pressure, enjoyment of children,
et cetera. Whatever the reason
I feel it is unjust to expect
the rest of the Stanford
community to pay for one
individual's having children.
