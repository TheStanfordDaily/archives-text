# Plunkett Picked First In Pro Draft
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
At 7:04 yesterday morning, the mystery that
never really was a mystery was over. The Boston
Patriots took four minutes to announce their first
round draft choice in the professional football draft,
and to the surprise of no one except possibly Archie
Manning they picked Jim Plunkett.
The quarterback who had won nearly every award
possible during his three year career, capped by a
victory in the Rose Bowl, achieved the final honor
possible as a collegian—that of being the first pick in
the professional draft.
Plunkett was in New York at the Downtown
Athletic Club when he received the news. "I feel
honored to be picked first, I just feel great about it.
It will be great to play with Boston. I feel I can
play right now as a pro, but 1 don't expect to play
right away."
It was no secret that Plunkett would have
preferred to go to a West Coast team, preferably the
San Francisco 4 9ers, but the Patriots passed up
offers made by 17 of the 25 other teams and
decided to keep Plunkett for themselves.
Bill Sullivan, the president of football's
least-successful team, admitted that earlier they had
thought of trading Plunkett to strengthen themselves
at several positions. But he said that after Coach
John Mazur saw Plunkett in the Rose Bowl, the
decision was made to keep him unless some
unbelievable trade developed.
Namath Like?
Mazur obviously was overcome with joy about
Plunkett's selection. "He's the Namath of the future.
He has a magnetism about him that few athletes
have. I don't know what it is, but whatever it is, I
want some of it. I think the Boston Patriots' future
can be his future."
As was expected the next two first round picks

were also quarterbacks. Archie Manning went to New
Orleans and Santa Clara's Dan Pastorini, another local
boy, was grabbed by the Houston Oilers.
But although this had been the "Year of the
Quarterback" in college football, no quarterbacks
were picked after these three until the 56 th choice.
On the third round, Houston picked another QB,
Kansas State's Lynn Dickey and three choices later,
Atlanta got Leo Hart from Duke University.
Notre Dame's Joe Theismann, considered by some
people to be better than Plunkett, was not chosen
until the fourth round when Miami took him.
QB IVades
But the quarterbacks in the news were not only
the rookies-to-be. Veteran quarterbacks were also on
the move. For as far as yesterday was concerned,
this might have been called "The Year of the
Trade." Four quarterbacks were involved in trades
today. But the earliest and biggest trade involved
seven players and eight draft choices.
Shortly before 7:30 it was announced that Los
Angeles and Washington had made a big trade. And
then the details were announced. The Rams sent
linebackers Jack Pardee, Maxie Baughn, Myron
Pottios, defensive end Diron Talbert, Offensive guard
John Wilbur and running back Jeff Jordan, in
addition to the Rams 197 2 fifth round choice to the
Redskins.
In return Tommy Prothro picked up linebacker
Marlin McKeever, Washington's first and third round
choices this year and their third through seventh
choices next season. So Prothro got a lot of youth
and six Rams can now join their deposed coach,
George Allen, who has taken over at Washington.
The veteran quarterbacks who were traded
included Don Horn who went to Denver from Green
Bay; Zeke Bratkowski who went back to Green BAy
from Minnesota; Norm Snead who went from
