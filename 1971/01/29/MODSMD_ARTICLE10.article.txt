# TV Ads Prostitute Women
## 
### MARY CORFF 
Commercial television builds
many myths for the American
public. None, however, is as
criminal or as destructive as
the prostitution of the
American woman's intelligence
which takes place in current
television advertising.
Here the repetition of the
catchy phrase promotes not
only the advertiser's product but
also an image of the woman
which is an outrageous insult
to more than one half the
country's population.
Seemingly convinced that
there are two types of women
(good, but dull, and naughty,
but exciting), advertisers
conclude that neither Brand X
nor Brand Y is a person in her
own right, capable of
commanding the respect of
other human beings.
There is, for instance, little
to admire about the vapid,
plastic beauty who sweeps onto
the viewing screen clad in a
few yards of strategically-placed
material, her attire emphasizing
her most valuable assets which
are rarely located above the
neck. This woman is seen
draping herself around oversized
cans of men's shaving cream
apparently suffering from some
form of mental insufficiency as
she purrs, "Take it off, take it
all off."
Crossed Hearts
Or she may tell the viewing
audience that her "cross the
heart" bra got her where she is

today. Where she is today is
indecent, but nontheless, we
are asked to believe that a
woman who crosses her heart
with Playtex will find happiness
as some man's mistress.
If that isn't convincing, a
Swedish blonde advises us that
without her Lady Norelco, she
wouldn't have George. And, of
course, without George, she
would be nothing.
By now, even the dullest
viewer should have concluded
that a woman's worth does not

lie in her own humanity, her
abilities or her individual efforts.
Without a man, she has no worth,
little intelligence and even less
dignity.
Wife and Mother
What about that other type
of woman? She is the wife and
mother. But how is she
portrayed?
This is the woman who
worries whether her chicken is
crisp enough to get and keep a

man. If that were all there is
to it, men might be expected
to marry restaurants.
She is also somewhat at a
loss over her housework,
operating the washing machine,
and wondering why her
neighbor's laundry is whiter
than hers. She has no
intellectual pretensions. We
must conclude that she is
fortunate indeed to have found
a man to provide for sucn a
dull-witted creature.
This woman has other
problems as well. She is
emotional and needs a special
deodorant. If she drives, her
husband had better invest in
polyglas tires because the
family car will need all the
help it can get. Finally, when
her husband comes home from
work, she bothers him with
chatter about the complexities
of hanging a picture. He
develops an Excedrin headache.
Working Woman's Woes
In a few rare cases, TV
offers a portrayal of woman as
working woman; she wears

glasses and unattractive clothes
and is miserable until the boss
notices she uses Listerine and
liberates her to the fulfilment
of home life and the challenge
of whitening and brightening
shirts.
The nightly portrayals of the
American woman assume that
she is inferior in every
non-physical aspect. Moreover,
it is made clear that this
helpless creature is not capable
of an adult partnership with a
man in an honest, equal and
growing relationship.
It is made to appear that
the normal, in fact the most
desirable, woman will abandon
her higher aspirations and rely
instead on her simpler wares in
a market which was made for
men.
The image is destructive
both to the woman who wishes
to use her talents as a
homemaker and to the woman
who wishes to develop her
abilities in a field outside her
home.
It is simply prostitution.
