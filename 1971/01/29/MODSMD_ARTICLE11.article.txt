# Van Gogh Exhibit Worth Long Wait
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Standing in line is always
frustrating. But waiting to get
into the van Gogh exhibit at
the De Young Museum is an
experience in itself.
Walking past the 200 or 300
yards of art-lovers, I noticed
young and old, crew-cut and
long-haired, well-dressed and
grubby.
Some had brought folding
chairs, while others stacked all
kinds of food to nourish them
during their long stand. And
what was left after the potato
chips and candy and cookies
had been passed around, made
a feast for the swooping
seagulls.
For those who had forgotten
food and didn't like what
other people passed around,
there was a red canteen truck
parked beside the line. A fat,
apronned, vendor pushed pink
popcorn, cokes and hot dogs
behind the counter in a scene
which seemed somehow out of
place at an art exhibit.
Banjo Passes Time
The wait got boring, but
they're were little events that
made it go quicker. First there
was the strolling banjo and
fiddler who performed a
rendition of "June Apple"
which may never be equalled.
Then there was the itinerant
artist who sketched people in
pencil, ink, charcoal or pastels
at prices ranging from two to
ten dollars.
Finally, I made it up to the
front door, but I wasn't in
yet. I waited for 15 more
minutes entertained by a
Pinkerton guard who gave
directions to the exhibit, the
bus stop, and the bathroom.
For the next hour and a
quarter I found out that it was
worth the 2 1/2 hour wait and
more. The chance to view so
many diverse works of such a
variable and powerful master as
Van Gogh is quite an
experience.

The paintings everyone has
seen in books were there —
"The Potato Eaters,"
"Gauguin's Chair" and the

haunting self-portrait of this
master who cut off his own
ear and finally took his own
life before reaching the age of
forty.
The magnitude of his talent
can only be appreciated
through an exhibit of this
scope which displays so many
of his works. His understanding
of nature is so deep and comes
through beautifully in his
landscapes and paintings of
trees.
His wheatfields with birds
overhead are expecially
beautiful. His two paintings of
boats made me wonder why he
didn't paint more sea scenes.
And his abstracts, many done
while he was in a mental
hospital, are different, yet
equally impressive.
Paints Suffering
But it is his paintings of
people suffering which are the
greatest. The person who isn't
moved by his portrayal of
peverty and suffering is callous
indeed. His peasants working in
the field look so exhausted,
that they appear on the verge
of collapsing into a rubbery
heap.
And the eyes of his people
are similarly strange, suspended
somewhere between sadness,
regret and anger.
The exhibit is magnificent.
You are not rushed through.
You can move quickly if you
wish or stay and study a
particular work. But most
people are content to move
slowly along with the flow,
taking a little over an hour to
cover the exhibit.
Well-Planned Exhibit
The d isplay is well
introduced by a room filled
with descriptions of Van
Gogh's life and analysis of his
work.
The experience is hard to
describe, so I won't go any
further. All I can suggest is
that if you possibly can, go on
this final weekend of the show.
The exhibit will be open
today, tomorrow and Sunday
from 10 to 4 and the price is
a mere 5 0 cents for students.

Some had brought folding
chairs, while others stacked all
kinds of food to nourish them
during their long stand. And
what was left after the potato
chips and candy and cookies
had been passed around, made
a feast for the swooping
seagulls.
For those who had forgotten
food and didn't like what
other people passed around,
there was a red canteen truck
parked beside the line. A fat,
apronned, vendor pushed pink
popcorn, cokes and hot dogs
behind the counter in a scene
which seemed somehow out of
place at an art exhibit.
Banjo Passes Time
The wait got boring, but
they're were little events that
made it go quicker. First there
was the strolling banjo and
fiddler who performed a
rendition of "June Apple"
which may never be equalled.
Then there was the itinerant
artist who sketched people in
pencil, ink, charcoal or pastels
at prices ranging from two to
ten dollars.
Finally, I made it up to the
front door, but I wasn't in
yet. I waited for 15 more
minutes entertained by a
Pinkerton guard who gave
directions to the exhibit, the
bus stop, and the bathroom.
For the next hour and a
quarter I found out that it was
worth the 2 1/2 hour wait and
more. The chance to view so
many diverse works of such a
variable and powerful master as
Van Gogh is quite an
experience.
01 Favorites There
The paintings everyone has
seen in books were there —
"The Potato Eaters,"
"Gauguin's Chair" and the

haunting self-portrait of this
master who cut off his own
ear and finally took his own
life before reaching the age of
forty.
The magnitude of his talent
can only be appreciated
through an exhibit of this
scope which displays so many
of his works. His understanding
of nature is so deep and comes
through beautifully in his
landscapes and paintings of
trees.
His wheatfields with birds
overhead are expecially
beautiful. His two paintings of
boats made me wonder why he
didn't paint more sea scenes.
And his abstracts, many done
while he was in a mental
hospital, are different, yet
equally impressive.
Paints Suffering
But it is his paintings of
people suffering which are the
greatest. The person who isn't
moved by his portrayal of
peverty and suffering is callous
indeed. His peasants working in
the field look so exhausted,
that they appear on the verge
of collapsing into a rubbery
heap.
And the eyes of his people
are similarly strange, suspended
somewhere between sadness,
regret and anger.
The exhibit is magnificent.
You are not rushed through.
You can move quickly if you
wish or stay and study a
particular work. But most
people are content to move
slowly along with the flow,
taking a little over an hour to
cover the exhibit.
Well-Planned Exhibit
The d isplay is well
introduced by a room filled
with descriptions of Van
Gogh's life and analysis of his
work.
The experience is hard to
describe, so I won't go any
further. All I can suggest is
that if you possibly can, go on
this final weekend of the show.
The exhibit will be open
today, tomorrow and Sunday
from 10 to 4 and the price is
a mere 5 0 cents for students.


SELF-PORTRAIT—Ego-centric artist that he was, Vincent van
Gogh did three sketches of himself, working up to his famous
self-portrait. The De Young Museum shows all.
Standing in line is always
frustrating. But waiting to get
into the van Gogh exhibit at
the De Young Museum is an
experience in itself.
Walking past the 200 or 300
yards of art-lovers, I noticed
young and old, crew-cut and
long-haired, well-dressed and
grubby.
Some had brought folding
chairs, while others stacked all
kinds of food to nourish them
during their long stand. And
what was left after the potato
chips and candy and cookies
had been passed around, made
