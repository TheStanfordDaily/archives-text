# Bogart Film Tonight
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
John Huston's "Maltese
Falcon," playing here tonight,
is boring in the met
interesting way.
Humphrey Bogart looked
utterly wretched throughout
the movie, as if a small dog
was tugging at his trouser leg,
and Mary Astor looked as if
she might well have been that
dog. She can, of course, tug at
my trouser leg any time she
wants to.
Behind their conscious
verbosity, Huston's films are
haunted by the duplicity and
banality of language. In the
"Maltese Falcoi.," Huston

accidentally made his
ultimate—or considering his
prolificacy, perhaps his
penulti mate—statement about
this problem.
At the end of the film
when the bars of the elevator
door close behind Bridgit, she
remains silent; the sound track
dispenses with all dialogue (in
its existential essence always
banal and duplicitous).
I can see this as nothing
less than a stunning
break through.
To get back to the film,
what was it saying? To me it
said that man's loneliness laps
on the endless shore of his
indifference. There is something
of Ibsen in this and not a
little of Chekhov too, although
it is all really John Huston the
scriptwriter/director, who speaks
through Humphrey Bogart, God
bless him.
You may find quite a
different meaning. You are
perfectly entitled to, because
the film is larger than life, and
yet infinitely smaller. It is
precisely such pregnant
questions and doubts, gravid
with a whole new esthetic of
cinema that pull film away
from the celluloid Paleolithic.
