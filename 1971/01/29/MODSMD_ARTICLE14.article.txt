# M.D. Talks To Gays

### JIM DEERINGER 
The gay life can be called a response to
the basic human need for intimacy. Is it a
"sick" response that should be avoided or
"cured," or should a homosexual be
encouraged to seek a better gay life?
Dr. David Dorosin, head of the psychiatric
services at Cowell Health Center, talked
Wednesday evening with the Gay Students'
Union. He later explained that his chief aim
was "to let them know that homosexuals are
welcome to discuss any sort of personal
problem with the staff at Cowell, not just
those relating directly to his homosexuality."
Although Dr. Dorosin had difficulty giving
definitive answers to many of the questions,
the atmosphere was warm, sincere, and
honest.
Dr. Dorosin approaches the treatment of
homosexuals the same as he does that of
heterosexuals. "First they are people," he said,
"and we have to deal with their problems
apart from their sexual orientation." Mrs.
Kaplan, one of the two Cowell social workers
present, commented, "There is a tendency for
people to hang their problems on
homosexuality. They are relieved when they
find that they are entitled to the same
problems everyone else has."

"What a person comes in with isn't
necessarily what he really wants to be helped
with," said Mrs. Siegel, the other social
worker. The Cowell staff tries to sound a
patient out rather than tell him what to do.
"1 would say that our style is evocative rather
than declarative," said Dorosin. "I sometimes
feel that people think I'm holding back
something. These life decisions (such as where
to go to school or what to do about the
draft) are too important for us to make.
We're not that omniscient."
Dorosin noted that gay relationships tend to
be "more fragile than heterosexual ones. They
do not have the support of social sanctions;
they aren't ritualized and reinforced by
society. In terms of long-term relationships,
heterosexual ones seem to be more stable."
Gays find it hard to generalize about
reactions to their homosexuality. One
"self-identified homosexual" said, "I've had
many come up and say 'Tell me you're
homosexual and get it over with' and I've had
others say 'I don't want to know your
problems'." Another, who prefers to remain
incognito, said, "People around here tend to
accept things pretty well. I'd like to be able
to say to people, however, first 'I'm gay' and
second 'How do you react to that?', but I
can't. There are still some bigots at Stanford."
