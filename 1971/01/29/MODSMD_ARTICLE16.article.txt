# Pats' Plunkett
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
BOSTON The selection of Jim Plunkett by the Patriots in the pro
football draft was front page news here this afternoon, bringing to a
close two months of intense speculation in this sport-crazy city.
Both the Evening Globe and the Record American leatured pictures
of the Heisman Trophy winner on page one, and sports accounts of
the torrid Bruins and the Celtic-Milwaukee Bucs encounter took
second place to long stories about Piunkett.
The Pats, whose decision to draft Stanford's star will increase an
already substantial payroll for quarterbacks by several hundred
thousand dollars, are gambling that Plunkett will be more valuable
than the host of proven players and future draft choices made
available in pre-draft offers from most other NFL clubs. Boston
already has QB Joe Kapp who won't be traded.
And, by selecting Plunkett and signing him, the Patriots will be
choosing the course urged upon them by legions of fans,many of
whom apparently were basing their decision on whether to buy 1 971
season tickets on the outcome of the selection. Boston will be moving
into a new stadium in suburban Foxboro next fall, and Plunkett is
expected to be a major drawing card.
Of course, no one knows how much his presence will mean to the
Boston team at this time. The Patriots, whose 1 97 0 record was the
worst in all of pro football, will need more than Plunkett to gain
respectability. Most fans think that a .500 record in 1971 will be a
major accomplishment. Right now, the talk is of building a
championship club around him.
The foundations were laid today.
