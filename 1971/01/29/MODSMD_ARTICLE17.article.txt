# Indians Face SC
## 
### TOM QUINN 
Stanford's nonconference season comes to a close tonight when the
Indians meet Santa Clara's Broncos at Maples at 8 :00 p.m. In hopes of
attaining their fifth victory, the team will be attempting to rebound
from the tough set of opponents they faced in the past two weeks
against a team with a record comparable to their own, 5-10.
The Broncos have been inflicted with the same injury plague that
has blighted Stanford. Two of their starters, Bruce Bochte and Jolly
Spight, won't be seen on the court for the rest of this season. Santa
Clara's first year coach, Carroll Williams, has had to do his share of
juggling to make ends meet.
In fact, Santa Clara had no seniors listed on its roster after the
injuries decimated the squad. However, the Broncos haven't played
dead, winning four of their last six games, including an 80-78 upset of
UOP, the favorite in the West Coast Athletic Conference.
The Indians will finally have everyone fit to play in this last tune-up
for the remainder of conference play. The fans should be able to see a
full-size center, 6-10 Larry Rosennweig, on the hardcourt, in addition
to 6-5 sophomore forward Bob Buell. Senior co-captain Dennis
O'Neill will start for the first time since he was sidelined by a pinched
nerve in his neck.
Claude Terry is still on top in team scoring. Terry has 28 2 points
for a solid 18.8 average on the season. Mike Michel has chipped in
13.2 points per game while Dennis O'Neill raised his season statistics
to 10.0 after his 24-point effort in the Utah game.
in the latest Pac-8 statistics, the Indians rate third in the league in
team defense, allowing only 7 4.8 points per game. Unfortunately, the
team rests at the bottom in offense and rebouds, but surprisingly,
UCLA ranks lower in field goal percentage.
The big centers around the league dominate the individual
categories. Claude Terry follows up the awesome trio of Steve Hawes,
Stan Love, and Sidney Wicks in points per game, averaging 21.5 a
game in four league games.
The freshmen, enjoying a lofty 8-0 record, have two engagements
this weekend. Tonight the frosh challenge Santa Clara's freshman
team and then journey to San Jose Civic Auditorium for a match with
the San Jose State Frosh on Saturday. Both games are at 6 p.m.
Forward Steve Shupe should be back in action after being sidelined
a week with an ankle sprain. Shupe, at 6-6, is the team's leading
rebounder and probably the strongest man on the floor.
The front line has been the source of the team's strength. Close
games haven't been a problem and the team hasn't faced a real test
yet. The key to the team's perfect record lies in its mastery of the
boards.
Shupe, 6-8 Mike Mann, and 6-6 Jim Helbush have dominated every
opponent they've faced. Mann has unlimited potential and great
jumping ability to make up for his lack of muscle and complement his
maneuverability. Helbush is regarded as the ace on defense and has the
smoothness to hit from either the outside or the inside.

In fact, Santa Clara had no seniors listed on its roster after the
injuries decimated the squad. However, the Broncos haven't played
dead, winning four of their last six games, including an 80-78 upset of
UOP, the favorite in the West Coast Athletic Conference.
The Indians will finally have everyone fit to play in this last tune-up
for the remainder of conference play. The fans should be able to see a
full-size center, 6-10 Larry Rosennweig, on the hardcourt, in addition
to 6-5 sophomore forward Bob Buell. Senior co-captain Dennis
O'Neill will start for the first time since he was sidelined by a pinched
nerve in his neck.
Claude Terry is still on top in team scoring. Terry has 28 2 points
for a solid 18.8 average on the season. Mike Michel has chipped in
13.2 points per game while Dennis O'Neill raised his season statistics
to 10.0 after his 24-point effort in the Utah game.
in the latest Pac-8 statistics, the Indians rate third in the league in
team defense, allowing only 7 4.8 points per game. Unfortunately, the
team rests at the bottom in offense and rebouds, but surprisingly,
UCLA ranks lower in field goal percentage.
The big centers around the league dominate the individual
categories. Claude Terry follows up the awesome trio of Steve Hawes,
Stan Love, and Sidney Wicks in points per game, averaging 21.5 a
game in four league games.
The freshmen, enjoying a lofty 8-0 record, have two engagements
this weekend. Tonight the frosh challenge Santa Clara's freshman
team and then journey to San Jose Civic Auditorium for a match with
the San Jose State Frosh on Saturday. Both games are at 6 p.m.
Forward Steve Shupe should be back in action after being sidelined
a week with an ankle sprain. Shupe, at 6-6, is the team's leading
rebounder and probably the strongest man on the floor.
The front line has been the source of the team's strength. Close
games haven't been a problem and the team hasn't faced a real test
yet. The key to the team's perfect record lies in its mastery of the
boards.
Shupe, 6-8 Mike Mann, and 6-6 Jim Helbush have dominated every
opponent they've faced. Mann has unlimited potential and great
jumping ability to make up for his lack of muscle and complement his
maneuverability. Helbush is regarded as the ace on defense and has the
smoothness to hit from either the outside or the inside.
Stanford's nonconference season comes to a close tonight when the
Indians meet Santa Clara's Broncos at Maples at 8 :00 p.m. In hopes of
attaining their fifth victory, the team will be attempting to rebound
from the tough set of opponents they faced in the past two weeks
against a team with a record comparable to their own, 5-10.
The Broncos have been inflicted with the same injury plague that
has blighted Stanford. Two of their starters, Bruce Bochte and Jolly
Spight, won't be seen on the court for the rest of this season. Santa
Clara's first year coach, Carroll Williams, has had to do his share of
juggling to make ends meet.
