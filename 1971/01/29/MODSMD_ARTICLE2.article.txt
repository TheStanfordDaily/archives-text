# Overflow Crowd Forces Recess Of SJC Hearing
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Fifteen to 2 0 persons, followed
by a hundred supporters, last night
pushed past four Stanford policemen
into the Student Judicial Council
(SJC) and forced a recess in the
hearing of seven students charged
with disrupting Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech here January 11.
Pouring into the courtroom
minutes after the hearing began, the
supporters apparently gained
entrance when the door of a side
witness room was opened to let in
defendants who had been out in the
hall.
The hall was jammed with people
unable to get into the courtroom
which had been filled to capacity a
half an hour before the hearing was
to begin.
Stephen Heiser, one of the
defense coynsels for the seven,
clairtied that when the door to the
hall had been opened, he had asked
that any person who considered
himself a defendant to please step
forward. Several persons stepped
forward and were let in. It was
then that police officers attempted
to shut off the entrance to the
witness room once again.
As the crowd pushed against the
police officers, a short scuffle
ensued after which the police
officers were pushed aside and the
crowd in the hall moved into the
courtroom.
SJC chairman Howard Williams
then informed the defendants that
they would be allowed to designate
four people apiece who would have

passes to the next hearing. The
defendants responded by rising to
their feet and shouting, "Hold it in
Mem Aud!"
'Fascist!'
Williams then stated that the
meeting was recessed until 12:30
the following day and left the room
with the other SJC members.
Members of the gallery and defense
rose to their feet shouting
"Fascist!"
The hearing began when defense
counsel Owen Blank put forward a
motion to move the location of the
hearing to a spot that would be
able to accommodate the people out
in the hall who wished to be
present at the hearing.
Williams would not hear the
motion and asked that the
defendants be brought in.
Williams then left the room with
counsel informing the people present
that, "this is not a circus. It is a
hearing. Decorum will be
maintained."
Dialogue
After several minutes, Williams,
defense counsel Owen Blank, and
eight students, only four of them
defendants, entered the room to
sparse applause from the gallery.
Williams asked Blank if these
were his defendants.
Blank did not answer.
"Mr. Blank," said Williams.
"Yes," replied Blank.
''Then these are your
defendants?" questioned Williams.
"I was only replying yes to my

name, and that is the only question
I will answer." responded Blank.
Williams then began asking out
loud if each defendant were present
and received responses such as "I'm
Alice in Wonderland,"
Meanwhile, students had begun
coming through the door to the
witness room in large numbers and
filling up the area around the
defense table and the gallery.
It was at this point that Williams
recessed the hearing.
Afterwards, Williams said he had
no comment about the evening's
proceedings.
In a meeting after the hearing
last night, the SJC decided that
today's hearing will be heard in a
larger room. Although the exact
location is not definite yet, it is
expected that it will be in room
161-J of the Law School.

Mem Aud!"
'Fascist!'
Williams then stated that the
meeting was recessed until 12:30
the following day and left the room
with the other SJC members.
Members of the gallery and defense
rose to their feet shouting
"Fascist!"
The hearing began when defense
counsel Owen Blank put forward a
motion to move the location of the
hearing to a spot that would be
able to accommodate the people out
in the hall who wished to be
present at the hearing.
Williams would not hear the
motion and asked that the
defendants be brought in.
Williams then left the room with
counsel informing the people present
that, "this is not a circus. It is a
hearing. Decorum will be
maintained."
Dialogue
After several minutes, Williams,
defense counsel Owen Blank, and
eight students, only four of them
defendants, entered the room to
sparse applause from the gallery.
Williams asked Blank if these
were his defendants.
Blank did not answer.
"Mr. Blank," said Williams.
"Yes," replied Blank.
''Then these are your
defendants?" questioned Williams.
"I was only replying yes to my

name, and that is the only question
I will answer." responded Blank.
Williams then began asking out
loud if each defendant were present
and received responses such as "I'm
Alice in Wonderland,"
Meanwhile, students had begun
coming through the door to the
witness room in large numbers and
filling up the area around the
defense table and the gallery.
It was at this point that Williams
recessed the hearing.
Afterwards, Williams said he had
no comment about the evening's
proceedings.
In a meeting after the hearing
last night, the SJC decided that
today's hearing will be heard in a
larger room. Although the exact
location is not definite yet, it is
expected that it will be in room
161-J of the Law School.


POLARIZED Stanford policeman looks vigilant as protesters jam the hall outside the SJC courtroom
Fifteen to 2 0 persons, followed
by a hundred supporters, last night
pushed past four Stanford policemen
into the Student Judicial Council
(SJC) and forced a recess in the
hearing of seven students charged
with disrupting Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech here January 11.
Pouring into the courtroom
minutes after the hearing began, the
supporters apparently gained
entrance when the door of a side
witness room was opened to let in
defendants who had been out in the
hall.
The hall was jammed with people
unable to get into the courtroom
which had been filled to capacity a
half an hour before the hearing was
to begin.
Stephen Heiser, one of the
defense coynsels for the seven,
clairtied that when the door to the
hall had been opened, he had asked
that any person who considered
himself a defendant to please step
forward. Several persons stepped
forward and were let in. It was
then that police officers attempted
to shut off the entrance to the
witness room once again.
As the crowd pushed against the
police officers, a short scuffle
ensued after which the police
officers were pushed aside and the
crowd in the hall moved into the
courtroom.
SJC chairman Howard Williams
then informed the defendants that
they would be allowed to designate
four people apiece who would have

passes to the next hearing. The
defendants responded by rising to
their feet and shouting, "Hold it in
Mem Aud!"
'Fascist!'
