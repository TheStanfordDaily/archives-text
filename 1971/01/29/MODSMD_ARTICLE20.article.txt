# Ruggers Face BATS
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It would be a bit much to say
that Stanford's rugby season is
riding on this Saturday's game,
but there's no doubt about one
thing, when the Ba> Area Touring
Side comes to town, you'd better
be ready to put your best effort
together if you would like to
repeat as national champions.
The mdians will be bringing a
3-0 record into Saturday's clash
with the BATS, probably the
finest club team in the nation, and
off to a good start this >ear. Their
roster reads like a "Who's Who"
of former collegiate and
international rugby stars, playing
a game where experience counts
at least as much as youthfulness,
stro ;g legs, and a desire to knock
people dowii.
With the exception of a single,
upset loss in the December Seven
a Side Tournament, Stanford has

not lost a rugby game since the
last time they met the BATS here
on the Fram. So far this season,
the Tribe has counted wins over
San Francisco, Santa Clara, and
Peidmont, but none have been in
the runaway category.
The Tribe's scrum was binding
and rucking better ill last week's
game, but early season timing
errors slowed up the passing and
running attack of the backs. A
scheduling break gave the varsity a
good chance to work together by
themselves Wednesday, smoothing
out some of the difficulties, while
Stanford's seconds and fourths
squared off against Santa Clara's
first and second teams.
The seconds, coming off a 17 -0
victory over St. Mary's, battled
the Gaels to a 6-6 draw while the
fourths exploded to beat the
Santa Clara JV's24-16. Stanford's
"B's" scored first when winger

Reggie Sanderson, powered his
way 2 5 yards for a diving try in
the corner of the endzone.
Santa Clara came back on a
penalty kick to tie it up, but
Reggie broke free again to score
his second try of the game and
give the lead back to Stanford.
Santa Clara again tied it on a drop
kick in the fading moments.
Sanderson's running, which
literally cut a swath through the
Santa Clara defenders, gave reason
to believe that his days on the
seconds are numbered.
