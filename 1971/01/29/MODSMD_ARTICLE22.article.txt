# U.S. Officialdom Denies Wider Role In Indochina
## 
### 
While fighting near the Cambodian capital of
Phnom Penh continued yesterday, Secretary of Stale
William P. Holers failed to convince members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee (hat the Nixon
administration is not increasing U.S. involvement in
that small, embattled nation.
Rogers was, however, able to measure the
committee that the administration has at least
remained within the legal limits of U.S. Cambodian
operations established during the summer when
Congress passed the Cooper-Church amendment.
Six Senators Fulbright, Church, Symington,
Muskie, Aiken and Javits said they remain fearful
of increased U.S. involvement despite Rogers' efforts
to downplay the use of American helicopters and
planes in last week's battle to re-open Cambodia's
Highway 4. "My own feeling," committee Chairman
Fulbright said, "i.s that they are quite prepared to do
whatever is necessary, lie didn't say that. That's just
my impression."

After leaving the three and a half hour meeting,
Rogers t«>l<i reporters he does not believe that there
has been "any change in policy."
In Cambodia
In Cambodia, most battlefields except those near
Phnom I'enh were quiet after three days of heavy
fighting. A few Cambodian T-.'IH propeller planes not
destroyed in the attack on the Phnom Penh airport
Friday were called into action and bombed enemy
positions just across the Mekong River from the city.
Billowing clouds of black smoke were visible in the
capital.
Most of the fighting was centered near Saang, 12
miles south of Plmom Penh. Saang has been one of
the towns hardest hit in recent fighting.
Fifty American troops were killed in Indochina
last week, bringing the American death total to
4 4 ,355 . 295 Cl's were wounded during the week.
Moth figures represent sharp increases over the totals
released last week.
Stennis
Tuesday, Senate Armed Services Chairman John
Stennis said after a briefing with Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird that it may become
necessary to relax the Cooper-Church admendment
and expand U.S. ground military operations in
Cambodia.
Stennis suggested that il might, be necessary to
send U.S. ground aircraft controllers to direct
American airstrikes in Cambodia. The Cooper-Church
amendment prohibits the use of such ground
controllers and other ground combat troops or
advisors on Cambodian territory, but the bill does
not rule out the use of aircraft in Cambodia.
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, asked about
fears by committee members that the United States
could become involved in a new Vietnam in
Cambodia, replied "1 don't think that is possible. All
the imperatives are the other way. All our budget
planning."
"And we would not have the support if we got
bogged down, as the other administration did in
Vietnam," he added.
According to the Associated Press, a 60-man U.S.
military team, operating from the Cambodian capital
and Saigon will monitor the use of American military
aid in Cambodia. Yesterday Laird explained that the
group will not act as teachers or advisers but will
see that U.S. equipment is used effectively.
American forces have been spotted in Cambodia at
least once this week by network newsmen. CBS
Television filmed the hour-long visit of some 20
American personnel at the Phnom Penh airport where
they "rigged" and flew out two helicopters damaged
when the airport was shelled. The soldiers were
wearing civilian clothes, combat boots, and pistols.
At that time, however, the Defense Department
said that the pick-up mission did not represent a
policy change. Lurd later explained that it was a
part of an approved $200 million military aid
program and that the troops were recovering the
helicopters to speed repair on them.

see that U.S. equipment is used effectively.
American forces have been spotted in Cambodia at
least once this week by network newsmen. CBS
Television filmed the hour-long visit of some 20
American personnel at the Phnom Penh airport where
they "rigged" and flew out two helicopters damaged
when the airport was shelled. The soldiers were
wearing civilian clothes, combat boots, and pistols.
At that time, however, the Defense Department
said that the pick-up mission did not represent a
policy change. Lurd later explained that it was a
part of an approved $200 million military aid
program and that the troops were recovering the
helicopters to speed repair on them.
While fighting near the Cambodian capital of
Phnom Penh continued yesterday, Secretary of Stale
William P. Holers failed to convince members of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee (hat the Nixon
administration is not increasing U.S. involvement in
that small, embattled nation.
Rogers was, however, able to measure the
committee that the administration has at least
remained within the legal limits of U.S. Cambodian
operations established during the summer when
Congress passed the Cooper-Church amendment.
Six Senators Fulbright, Church, Symington,
Muskie, Aiken and Javits said they remain fearful
of increased U.S. involvement despite Rogers' efforts
to downplay the use of American helicopters and
planes in last week's battle to re-open Cambodia's
Highway 4. "My own feeling," committee Chairman
Fulbright said, "i.s that they are quite prepared to do
whatever is necessary, lie didn't say that. That's just
my impression."

After leaving the three and a half hour meeting,
Rogers t«>l<i reporters he does not believe that there
has been "any change in policy."
In Cambodia
In Cambodia, most battlefields except those near
Phnom I'enh were quiet after three days of heavy
fighting. A few Cambodian T-.'IH propeller planes not
destroyed in the attack on the Phnom Penh airport
Friday were called into action and bombed enemy
positions just across the Mekong River from the city.
Billowing clouds of black smoke were visible in the
capital.
Most of the fighting was centered near Saang, 12
miles south of Plmom Penh. Saang has been one of
the towns hardest hit in recent fighting.
Fifty American troops were killed in Indochina
last week, bringing the American death total to
4 4 ,355 . 295 Cl's were wounded during the week.
Moth figures represent sharp increases over the totals
released last week.
Stennis
Tuesday, Senate Armed Services Chairman John
Stennis said after a briefing with Secretary of
Defense Melvin R. Laird that it may become
necessary to relax the Cooper-Church admendment
and expand U.S. ground military operations in
Cambodia.
Stennis suggested that il might, be necessary to
send U.S. ground aircraft controllers to direct
American airstrikes in Cambodia. The Cooper-Church
amendment prohibits the use of such ground
controllers and other ground combat troops or
advisors on Cambodian territory, but the bill does
not rule out the use of aircraft in Cambodia.
Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, asked about
fears by committee members that the United States
could become involved in a new Vietnam in
Cambodia, replied "1 don't think that is possible. All
the imperatives are the other way. All our budget
planning."
"And we would not have the support if we got
bogged down, as the other administration did in
Vietnam," he added.
According to the Associated Press, a 60-man U.S.
military team, operating from the Cambodian capital
and Saigon will monitor the use of American military
aid in Cambodia. Yesterday Laird explained that the
group will not act as teachers or advisers but will
see that U.S. equipment is used effectively.
