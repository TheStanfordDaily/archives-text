# Who Is Guilty?
## Manson: An American Monster 
### CHRIS PECK 
Ever since America first awoke to
the name Charles Manson, he has
been a monster. A drug-crazed,
long-haired psychotic, Manson swept
through the country's imagination
like a tortured mightmare.
Last Monday afternoon, the 5'7",
semi-literate who had spent 2 0 of

his first 36 years in jail, was
assured of spending whatever
remains of his life there too.
It didn't seem to matter much to
Manson. He sat emotionless, as the
verdict was read, staring up at the
ceiling. "I don't care what you do
to me," he had said on the witness
stand two months before, "I've
always been yours anyway, 1 have
always been in your cell."
In some ways, the bizarre history
of Charles Manson, a scenario that
turned an invisible man into a
monster, fulfills a prophesy that
Manson made to the public long
ago. "1 am what you made me," he
had said on November 30, "and
you wanted a sadistic friend."
Unwed Mother
American society began to mold
Charles Manson when he was born
to an unwed mother. Then came
the years in the reformatory,
followed by prison.
"Just as some little boys and
girls learn to play with dolls and
toys," Mark Snider of the
Department of Psychology said,
"Manson learned to behave in a
different way. The learning
experiences from his life makes him
behave the way he does."
Manson explained his years in
prison too. "I was sitting in your
cells looking out the window," he
said, "looking at pictures and
magazines, and wishing that I could
go to high school and to the
proms. I've watched your world
grow up. Then I look at the things
you do and I don't understand

them. But now, I'm glad, brothers
and sisters, that I am what I am."
Prisons After Prisons
While Charlie sat in prison after
prison, society went on without
giving him a thought. But on
August 9th, 1969, America noticed.
Being a mass murderer is hot
copy for the media in the United
States. Newspapers, magazines and
television didn't miss anything they
could discover, overhear or invent
about the monster Manson. Not
only did Manson engineer a mass
murder, the papers read, but he also
took drugs, and had free sex!
Manson had other valuable assets
for those around him. Financial
assets. "For the attorneys in the
case," I>aw Professor .John Kaplan
said, "the Manson case was the big
chance to make it."
Instant Celebrity
Linda Kasabian, the prosecution's
star witness who lived with the
Manson family at the time of the
murders, became a celebrity. She
commands $ 5 0 0 0 per TV
performance to explain the horrors
that she saw.
And for the emotionally frail
relatives of Manson's victims there is
the monetary compensation. The
sister of slain Voyteck Frykowski
has filed a $2 million suit against
Manson to make up for "the loss
of a loved one."
Charles Manson became politically
involved in America too. The
question of his guilt or innocence
was shoved aside for the cause of
scoring political goals. "The real

point of the trial," wrote the Good
Times underground paper on
January 15th, "is that the
Tate— La-Bianca trial is a political
trial —and not just against the
Manson commune, but a trial
against all communes."
Political Coverage
Even the President of the United
States felt obliged to get a piece of
the political leverage that the fiend
Manson could wield. "He is a man
who was guilty, directly or
indirectly, for the death of eight
persons without reason," Nixon
blared in Denver, "and now he's
being made a folk hero by the
American press."
But who was really responsible
for making Charles Manson a folk
hero fiend? Who enlarged Charles
Manson's pathetic life into a
multi-million dollar enterprize of
newspaper selling and career making?
The answer is not hard to find.
"It's highly improbable that of all
the people in the world, Charles
Manson is so different from you
and me that he was driven by some
inner force to commit mass
murder," said psychology professor
David Rosenhan. "We'd already
made a sick society when Charles
Manson came around."
Manson himself theorized about
the gruesome nights that
immortalized him in American
history. Speaking very softly as the
only witness that spoke in his
defense, he said, "These children
that come at you with knives are
your children. You taught them."

American press."
But who was really responsible
for making Charles Manson a folk
hero fiend? Who enlarged Charles
Manson's pathetic life into a
multi-million dollar enterprize of
newspaper selling and career making?
The answer is not hard to find.
"It's highly improbable that of all
the people in the world, Charles
Manson is so different from you
and me that he was driven by some
inner force to commit mass
murder," said psychology professor
David Rosenhan. "We'd already
made a sick society when Charles
Manson came around."
Manson himself theorized about
the gruesome nights that
immortalized him in American
history. Speaking very softly as the
only witness that spoke in his
defense, he said, "These children
that come at you with knives are
your children. You taught them."
Ever since America first awoke to
the name Charles Manson, he has
been a monster. A drug-crazed,
long-haired psychotic, Manson swept
through the country's imagination
like a tortured mightmare.
Last Monday afternoon, the 5'7",
semi-literate who had spent 2 0 of

his first 36 years in jail, was
assured of spending whatever
remains of his life there too.
It didn't seem to matter much to
Manson. He sat emotionless, as the
verdict was read, staring up at the
ceiling. "I don't care what you do
to me," he had said on the witness
stand two months before, "I've
always been yours anyway, 1 have
always been in your cell."
In some ways, the bizarre history
of Charles Manson, a scenario that
turned an invisible man into a
monster, fulfills a prophesy that
Manson made to the public long
ago. "1 am what you made me," he
had said on November 30, "and
you wanted a sadistic friend."
Unwed Mother
American society began to mold
Charles Manson when he was born
to an unwed mother. Then came
the years in the reformatory,
followed by prison.
"Just as some little boys and
girls learn to play with dolls and
toys," Mark Snider of the
Department of Psychology said,
"Manson learned to behave in a
different way. The learning
experiences from his life makes him
behave the way he does."
Manson explained his years in
prison too. "I was sitting in your
cells looking out the window," he
said, "looking at pictures and
magazines, and wishing that I could
go to high school and to the
proms. I've watched your world
grow up. Then I look at the things
you do and I don't understand

them. But now, I'm glad, brothers
and sisters, that I am what I am."
Prisons After Prisons
While Charlie sat in prison after
prison, society went on without
giving him a thought. But on
August 9th, 1969, America noticed.
Being a mass murderer is hot
copy for the media in the United
States. Newspapers, magazines and
television didn't miss anything they
could discover, overhear or invent
about the monster Manson. Not
only did Manson engineer a mass
murder, the papers read, but he also
took drugs, and had free sex!
Manson had other valuable assets
for those around him. Financial
assets. "For the attorneys in the
case," I>aw Professor .John Kaplan
said, "the Manson case was the big
chance to make it."
Instant Celebrity
Linda Kasabian, the prosecution's
star witness who lived with the
Manson family at the time of the
murders, became a celebrity. She
commands $ 5 0 0 0 per TV
performance to explain the horrors
that she saw.
And for the emotionally frail
relatives of Manson's victims there is
the monetary compensation. The
sister of slain Voyteck Frykowski
has filed a $2 million suit against
Manson to make up for "the loss
of a loved one."
Charles Manson became politically
involved in America too. The
question of his guilt or innocence
was shoved aside for the cause of
scoring political goals. "The real

point of the trial," wrote the Good
Times underground paper on
January 15th, "is that the
Tate— La-Bianca trial is a political
trial —and not just against the
Manson commune, but a trial
against all communes."
Political Coverage
Even the President of the United
States felt obliged to get a piece of
the political leverage that the fiend
Manson could wield. "He is a man
who was guilty, directly or
indirectly, for the death of eight
persons without reason," Nixon
blared in Denver, "and now he's
being made a folk hero by the
American press."

Manson to make up for "the loss
of a loved one."
Charles Manson became politically
involved in America too. The
question of his guilt or innocence
was shoved aside for the cause of
scoring political goals. "The real

point of the trial," wrote the Good
Times underground paper on
January 15th, "is that the
Tate— La-Bianca trial is a political
trial —and not just against the
Manson commune, but a trial
against all communes."
Political Coverage
Even the President of the United
States felt obliged to get a piece of
the political leverage that the fiend
Manson could wield. "He is a man
who was guilty, directly or
indirectly, for the death of eight
persons without reason," Nixon
blared in Denver, "and now he's
being made a folk hero by the
American press."
But who was really responsible
for making Charles Manson a folk
hero fiend? Who enlarged Charles
Manson's pathetic life into a
multi-million dollar enterprize of
newspaper selling and career making?
The answer is not hard to find.
"It's highly improbable that of all
the people in the world, Charles
Manson is so different from you
and me that he was driven by some
inner force to commit mass
murder," said psychology professor
David Rosenhan. "We'd already
made a sick society when Charles
Manson came around."
Manson himself theorized about
the gruesome nights that
immortalized him in American
history. Speaking very softly as the
only witness that spoke in his
defense, he said, "These children
that come at you with knives are
your children. You taught them."
