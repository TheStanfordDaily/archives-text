# Lyman Addresses Faculty Senate, Defends Franklin Case Proposal
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
President Richard Lyman yesterday defended his
actions in the H. Bruce Franklin case to the Faculty
Senate and explained his reasons for announcing the
proposed penalty asked against Franklin.
It "seemed unfair not to give the respondent
Franklin the best estimate (of possible penalty) I
could make," Lyman said, "...since the knowledge
of this would inevitably constitute "a factor in his
consideration of his next steps."
Lyman added that it also seemed desirable to
announce the possible penalty (of suspension without
pay for one quarter) "to leave as little ambiguity
and room for rumor-mongering as possible on the
subject."
The Senate also approved the charge to a
committee to study graduate education and asked the
study be completed by April 1 , 1 972. The
Committee on Committees announced that J. Merrill
Carlsmith, associate prof, of psychology and fellow of
the university, would head the study.
The Senate had previously approved the idea and

substance of the study and yesterday approved the
formal charge. The study will:
Details
— identify and articulate long-range goals of
graduate education;
—study the graduate in the departments using
departmental visitation teams;
—study specific topics such as graduate student
teaching and financial support of graduate students;
—formulate and disseminate recommendations, and
specify appropriate means for their implementation.
The Senate also approved a recommendation from
the Committee on Undergraduate Studies (CUS) that
will allow students to take up to 20 units
automatically. The Faculty Senate had limited
students to a maximum academic load of 1H units
per quarter in action taken Dec. 1969. The limit was
to be imposed fall quarter 1970.
Blossoming Petitions
However, according to the CUS, the number of
petitions of students requesting to take 19 or 20
units "ha., reached such a level that it has interfered
willi the capacity of the Committee to go on with
its work ..."
Therefore, the committee asked for and received
permission to allow the registrar to administratively
grant petitions for students who wish to take up to
20 units of credit. The Senate also decided that
undergraduates admitted before September, 1970,
could observe the maximum limits in effect prior to
September in other words, the 18 unit maximum
limit will affect only the freshmen.
Hill Karto/.ian, president of the Alumni
Association, addressed the Senate and asked the
faculty group appoint faculty committee on alumni
relations. Noting that many of the 37,000 association
members want direct contact with the University,
Karto/.ian urged the faculty to take an active role in
dealing with Stanford graduates.
Redefinition
Alumni on the whole have "no desire to dictate
how the University" will be run, Karto/.ian noted.
Hut he did say that the nature and extent of alumni
input into University life needs to be defined that
faculty consideration is necessary to settle the issue.
In Lyman's address to the Senate In* again
rejected Franklin's request of a trial before the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) rather than before
the Advisory Council, lie said, "The SJC trial is
impossible since only the Advisory Hoard has
standing under Tenure policy in cases where the
penalty may involve discriminatory loss of salary."
lie added, "Had we attempted to accede to his
(Franklin's) demand to be tried by the SJC, we
would be vulnerable to the charge of having ignored
or bypassed procedures established under Tenure
Policy."
