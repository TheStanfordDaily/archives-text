President Richard Lyman yesterday defended his
actions in the H. Bruce Franklin case to the Faculty
Senate and explained his reasons for announcing the
proposed penalty asked against Franklin.

the university, would head the study.

per quarter in action taken Dec. 1969. The limit was
to be imposed fall quarter 1970.
