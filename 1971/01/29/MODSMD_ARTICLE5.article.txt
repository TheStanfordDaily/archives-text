# drop charges, respect protesters
## Accept Nuremberg Standard

I think we are wrong in our
individual and institutional
responses to the disruption of
the Lodge talk. I believe the
protesters are to be
appreciated. They acted for the
consciences of the Nation and
the University. Before
explaining this position, I
should emphasize that I am
not a disinterested observer. My
son has been charged by the
University with participation in
the protest.
My view derives from my
attitude toward the Vietnam
war, my appreciation of the
Nuremberg precedent, and my
hopes for the future of the
University. I consider the
United States intervention in

Vietnam thoroughly wrong. If
the Vietnamese require a
revolution and civil war to
develop their country that is
their right, just as it was ours
200 years ago. In Vietnam we
have pursued political goals
through massive physical
violence, torture of opponents
and killing of our youth.
Governmental deceit, disregard
for the needs of our own
people and repression are but
some of the domestic
consequences of this action.
The Nuremberg judgements,
and their explicit codes of
conduct, represent a hallmark
in human history. As the basis
for this Nation's trial,
judgement and sentencing of
others, they assume the
character of law. I am
particularly mindful of the
precedent because physicians
and their actions figure
significantly amongst the
crimes. The recent book
"Nuremberg and Vietnam" by
Telfond Taylor, U.S. Chief
Counsel at Nuremberg,
establishes by Nuremberg the
guilt of military and civilian
leaders of this country for war
crimes in Vietnam, and
reiterates the duty of citizen
and soldier alike to oppose our
actions. That guilt is shared by
each of us for allowing the
government to act as it has.
We cannot ask of ourselves less
than we expected of the
Germans and Japanese.
This University, and some of
its faculty and trustees, have
been participants in and
financial beneficiaries of the
intervention in Vietnam. To the
extent that actions establish the
institution, Stanford University
shares to some degreee the
indictment. In relation to this,
Taylor observes, "the war in
the massive lethal dimensions it
acquired after 1964 was the
work of highly educated
academics and
administrators... it was not
President Kennedy himself, but
the men he brought to
Washington as advisors and who
stayed on with President
Johnson — the Rusks,
McNamaras, Bundys and
Rostows—who must bear major
responsibility for the war and
the course it took".
Universities, which should hold
high the torch r vf human
well-being and justice, cannot
stand many such accusations.
President David Starr Jordan
of Stanford long ago set a
tradition of active opposition
to war. However, antipathy to
outspoken opponents of war
has also long been present at
Stanford. Jordan was retired
from the Presidency early,
probably for his views. An
associate of both men records
that Herbert Hoover said of
Jordan, "Peace men like Jordan
should be locked up". Ours
should be the tradition of
Jordan.
It is argued that Lodge is
innocent of war crimes until
proved guilty, and therefore
should be treated as any other
University guest. I believe that

is legally true, but politically
false. Individual guilt is yet to
be determined; the evidence of
collective guilt is in. Lodge is a
member of the government and
an architect of Vietnam policy.
A government will not try
itself. Suits by citizens against
thus war have been rejected.
Local electoral initiatives in
opposition to the war have
been voided. The war has again
been intensified despite
governmental assurances to the
contrary. The citizen has no
resourse but to protest in a
manner which underscores both
the issue and the obligation to
protest.
But, it is countered, the
protest should be polite and
not infringe the right to speak.

right, then so do those who
oppose war crimes. Yet they
only shouted in non-violent
protest. Now they are to be
punished. Would we not have
considered Germans who
shouted Goering down to be
rare and honorable men?
To my mind, to indict for
peaceful protest the opponents
of war crimes is to align the
University with moral
degradation of the country and
counterpose the University to a
citizen's duty. To argue
neutrality of the University in
this situation is to use
neutrality as a shield against
moral challenge.
Professor Brown states that
massive protests and questioning
should have greeted Lodge, not

to argue neutrality of the Univer
sity in this situation is to use
neutrality as a shield against moral
challenge.

To me this view reflects a
disarray of values. Our
government kills for political
purposes. It has killed not just
soldiers but, by conservative
count, hundreds of thousands
of civilians. Bombers move
above Vietnam without
opposition delivering their
indiscriminate death. The
victims have no rights
whatsoever, much less free
speech.
Specifically, how applicable
is the free speech argument to
this situation? I admit to some
uncertainty on this; if the
University were truly free and
neutral the argument would
have power. However, the
University is not neutral in the
sense of favoring no side or
group. Its faculty and student
body are not representative of
the population economically,
racially or socially. Its
curriculum and research have
been narrow in scope. It has
great financial dependence upon
the military and war industry.
Each of these biases
influences our individual and
institutional perceptions of
issues. They have led the
University into collaborative
relationships with government
and military policy. Lodge
represents that policy. His is
the dominant view, the view of
the transgressor. To defend
expression of that view as free
speech when the victims have
no opportunity to be heard at
all is to mock free speech. The
Nuremberg precedent establishes
aspects of man's relations to
his fellow men across
boundaries and between
enemies. Our understanding of
the meaning of free speech
similarly should go beyond the
comfortable assumptions and
tranquility of our immediate
community.
The government defends its
actions as fighting fire with
fire. If the government has that

disruption. I am sympathetic.
But from our comfortable
inactivity about Lodge, neither
he nor I should use that
argument retrospectively against
the courageous few who
accepted the jeopardy and
stood up.
Professor Brown argues for
preserving the University as a
small island of civility in a sea
of conflict. I have sympathy
for that view too, and have
difficulty discarding it. However
it is unreal, an illusion. The
vivid lesson of the past few
years at Stanford and other
universities is that they cannot
depart the society in which
they exist, that in fact they
have assumed some of the
pernicious features of that
society. Our personal
responsiblity is to enter that
conflict and try to change it
or, at least, to rid the
University of its bad features.
It is not necessary to agree
with the political views of the
protesters to support their
position in this case. I do not
agree with some which I know.
It is not necessary to approve
their tactics, but only to
recognize that they are
insignificant in comparison with
the actions of our government.
It is necessary to accept the
principles of Nuremberg for
which millions sacrificed in the
antifascist war and to act upon
them. Otherwise history will
judge us, this University and
this Nation wanting.
Let the University drop the
charges, and respect the
protesters. Let us build a
different University free of
involvement in aggressive war
and perhaps war crimes. There
has been no dearth of specific
proposals to this end. When
will we address ourselves to
them fully and vigorously?
When will we be able to
stand proud?

BRUCE FRANKLIN—Noted Melville scholar, outspoken Maoist, and most recently disruptor of
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge, Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin has become the object of
considerable attention on campus. The controversy, while centering on what punishment, if any, he
should receive, must also deal with the questions of free speech and faculty self-discipline. On this page
two professors discuss the issues, while letters provide further perspectives.
