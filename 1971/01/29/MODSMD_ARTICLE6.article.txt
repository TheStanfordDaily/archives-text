# franklin impairs university's credibility
## To Rebuild Faith In Reason

Before pressing my own view
concerning Professor Franklin's
right to continued membership in
the University, let me state some
political views as preamble. I am
disgusted by probably all those
aspects of the contemporary scene
that move Professor Franklin. I
abhor the Vietnam war, as an act
of national rape. Whatever may be
said to explain its gradual
beginnings, its continuation by
the last two administrations rests
on a mixture of stupidity and
hypocricy that boggles the mind. I
am sickened by the image we
present to the world at large: an
incredible concoction of
Nuremberg and Vietnam; of Watts
and SSTs; of officers who,
unembarrassed, declare they
destroyed a village to save it; of a
senior U.S. Senator who wanted
the Defense Budget expanded to
ensure that the few who survived
the holocaust were true-blooded
Americans. I am sickened by that
failure of national leadership
which for 10 years at least has
been either too stupid or too
beholden somewhere to assert a
decent set of goals and priorities;
unable to mobilize adequately the
vast national competence available
to it; and - lets face it - simply
unable to command a broad base
for either trust or respect. I am
tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,
and - above all - of the future. I
want, like Bruce Franklin, to
rebel. I want to shake the
establishment into awareness and
effective action. I want an end to
the idiocy of the seniority system
in the Congress. I want a political
mechinery that will face truth and
work with it, will utilize fact and
competence. I want an end to
personal empires in the federal
government - that is, I want J.
Edgar Hoover out. I want an
Attorney General who sees the
law as an instrument of
civilization, of human justice, not
of political power. I want an
honest, realistic program to
achieve racial equality. I want the
Pentagon effectively constrained
by civilian power, and its budget
slashed to divert our resources to
a worldwide Common Cause
whose goals are human happiness
and human beauty, the only goals
worthy of man, and which only
the non-violence of civilization
can bring.
History will see to it that
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon- but especially
Johnson-will face the charge, not
only that they initiated,
perpetrated and perpetuated the
rape of Indochina, but also that in
so doing, they shattered the fabric
of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance
of power, in its cant and in its
actions, that has alienated a whole
generation of youth from the
democratic institutions on which
civilization rests. Match Johnson's
campaign pledges of 1 96 4 with his
actions in the Tonkin Gulf affair,
and in the ensuing years.
Bruce Franklin, I gather, would
agree with me in all of this. But
there our agreement ends. It is not
enough to say that I deplore his
behavior in Dinkelspiel when Mr.
Lodge attempted to speak there; I
believe it totally incompatible
with the nature and goals of the
University; and as such it
raises—squarely—the question of
his continued right to membership
in the University.
There.' are three issues to
explicate. The first concerns the
facts of the case, and Professor
Franklin has made
these~.su rprisingly-Temarkably
clear. He not only agrees , he
boasts that he deliberately
contributed to the brute noise

which was used in Dinkelspiel to
block Mr. Lodge's speech. On
television he openly regretted he
had, alas, not done more in this
direction. He has then, by his own
public testimony, deliberately
joined in a successful attempt to
prevent someone from stating a
position which, had it been heaid,
could have been debated, and if
found wrong, exposed as such.
The second issue concerns the
nature and function of the
University as a social
institution — as the
institutionalization of mind. It is
the universities who are the
custodians of those precious
human possessions of reason; of

any resort to violence...should
constitute automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University.

the right to skepticism and
debate; of concern for fact, as
well as value; they are indeed
custodian of almost all the things
on which the tenuous state of
civilized man rests crucially. They
should be, and have been, an
embodiment of mind and a
mainspring of cultural evolution.
In this view, the right to be heard
at a university is fundamental, and
the resort to physical blockage of
a statable viewpoint is to be
precluded totally, and without
qualification. Further, I believe
that any resort to violence,
whether in blocking speech, in
trashing or in physically impeding
others from their normal
functions, should constitute
automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University as
soon as the fact has been
established by due process. Nor
can I perceive why, in that due
process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
days when we, the university
faculties (including our radical
colleagues), fought for tenure
precisely to protect freedom of
speech against political
persecution? Or has Professor
Franklin in the meantime
acquired some divine stature and
godlike insight that legitimizes his
personal dispensation of freedom
to speak in Dinkelspiel? How, in
shouting hown Mr. Lodge, does he
differ from the hardhats whose
use of antimind in New York
caused so much joy in the hearts
of those we jointly oppose? How
does he differ from those equially
desperate antiminds who
prevented Mr. Hickel from
speaking at Princeton last
April—then consider the political
courage Mr. Hickel himself
eventually displayed.
Certainly by his cheap resort to
antimind Professor Franklin
cannot hope to heal the wounds
of a society that owe their origin
largely to a lack of mind in public
affairs: Either he has other goals
in mind totally incompatible with
a university, or if in fact he does
so hope, what has happened to
Stanford's procedures for
screening intellectual
competence? ,
The third issue concerns the
politics of ■reform. That, in its
fullness, obviously transcends the
scope of this letter, but there are
aspects of it that Professor
Franklin and his supporters
evidently fail to see. How, 1 have
been asked, can we condemn

Franklin on the one hand, and at
the same time charge the German
universities with moral dereliction
in the 1930'5? And that I do. I
believe, from what 1 know of the
facts, that the university
community in Germany failed in
its obligation to perceive the
growing evil and combat it. They
were wrong, to say the least, when
they abandoned Thomas Mann
and others as lonely voices crying
out against the growing decay of
their national civilization. They
should at least have tried, by
reasoned public statement and
non-violent, yet mighty,
demonstration, to stir the
conscience of the German people.

But in stating this I am obviously
not suggesting they should have
resorted to the idiocy of shouting
down government officials. Any
university community has gone
mad, indeed, when it resorts to
brute force to fight brute force.
There is evil growing here and
in our own time; and it comes
from many sources—from the
right and from the left. I am one
of many thousands who believe
that individuals in the University
community should seek to define
and fight the roots of that evil.
And the record—far from being all
gloomy—makes it clear that the
universities can be and have been
effective in stirring the national
consicence in recent years. We did
well last May: without the
strength of our protest, we would
still be in Cambodia—or should I
say even more enmeshed than we
still are. But to the extent last
spring's protest succeeded it did
so by its breadth and depth, by
the multitude of sober voices that
cried out, not by the violence of a

lunatic fringe. For antimind on
campus is now a tool in the hands
of our adversaries in the quest for
social reform, and that quest was
set back, not advanced, by Bruce
Franklin's performance in
Dinkelspiel.
I was as angry as Mr. Franklin,
but I have no intention of letting
that emotion so paralyze my mind
that I lose the battle; because the
battle can be won only with
mind—and by a choice of
battleground where the National
Guard and the Sheriff's armed
deputies have" neither access nor
special competence; where the
common sense and decency that
the electorate does possess are
given their chance; and where the
real issues are not blurred by the
behavior of a desperate, deluded
fringe from either inside or
outside the University. I agree
there is cause for despair, but not
for desperation. I know the hour
is late, but it is not too late for
reason to prevail. Aitfl I insist that
the only fu'aire worth
contemplating rejects antimind
wherever it occurs, in Wallace, in
Agnew—and in Bruce Franklin.
Our goal must be to rebuild
faith in reason and in decency as
primary forces in the life of man;
for it is precisely in the loss of
simple decency (even in high
office), and in the loss of reason,
the loss of faith in reason—in the
efficacy of mind—that is
responsible for so much of our
current illness. Given those beliefs
I cannot escape condemning
Bruce Franklin's treatment of
Ambassador Lodge, no matter
what his role in Vietnam; and
given a commitment to political
action, I cannot escape this public
statement of my belief that
Professor Franklin's continued
association with Stanford can
only impair the University's
credibility and effectiveness on
the battleground of its own
choice.

tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,
and - above all - of the future. I
want, like Bruce Franklin, to
rebel. I want to shake the
establishment into awareness and
effective action. I want an end to
the idiocy of the seniority system
in the Congress. I want a political
mechinery that will face truth and
work with it, will utilize fact and
competence. I want an end to
personal empires in the federal
government - that is, I want J.
Edgar Hoover out. I want an
Attorney General who sees the
law as an instrument of
civilization, of human justice, not
of political power. I want an
honest, realistic program to
achieve racial equality. I want the
Pentagon effectively constrained
by civilian power, and its budget
slashed to divert our resources to
a worldwide Common Cause
whose goals are human happiness
and human beauty, the only goals
worthy of man, and which only
the non-violence of civilization
can bring.
History will see to it that
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon- but especially
Johnson-will face the charge, not
only that they initiated,
perpetrated and perpetuated the
rape of Indochina, but also that in
so doing, they shattered the fabric
of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance
of power, in its cant and in its
actions, that has alienated a whole
generation of youth from the
democratic institutions on which
civilization rests. Match Johnson's
campaign pledges of 1 96 4 with his
actions in the Tonkin Gulf affair,
and in the ensuing years.
Bruce Franklin, I gather, would
agree with me in all of this. But
there our agreement ends. It is not
enough to say that I deplore his
behavior in Dinkelspiel when Mr.
Lodge attempted to speak there; I
believe it totally incompatible
with the nature and goals of the
University; and as such it
raises—squarely—the question of
his continued right to membership
in the University.
There.' are three issues to
explicate. The first concerns the
facts of the case, and Professor
Franklin has made
these~.su rprisingly-Temarkably
clear. He not only agrees , he
boasts that he deliberately
contributed to the brute noise

which was used in Dinkelspiel to
block Mr. Lodge's speech. On
television he openly regretted he
had, alas, not done more in this
direction. He has then, by his own
public testimony, deliberately
joined in a successful attempt to
prevent someone from stating a
position which, had it been heaid,
could have been debated, and if
found wrong, exposed as such.
The second issue concerns the
nature and function of the
University as a social
institution — as the
institutionalization of mind. It is
the universities who are the
custodians of those precious
human possessions of reason; of

any resort to violence...should
constitute automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University.

the right to skepticism and
debate; of concern for fact, as
well as value; they are indeed
custodian of almost all the things
on which the tenuous state of
civilized man rests crucially. They
should be, and have been, an
embodiment of mind and a
mainspring of cultural evolution.
In this view, the right to be heard
at a university is fundamental, and
the resort to physical blockage of
a statable viewpoint is to be
precluded totally, and without
qualification. Further, I believe
that any resort to violence,
whether in blocking speech, in
trashing or in physically impeding
others from their normal
functions, should constitute
automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University as
soon as the fact has been
established by due process. Nor
can I perceive why, in that due
process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
days when we, the university
faculties (including our radical
colleagues), fought for tenure
precisely to protect freedom of
speech against political
persecution? Or has Professor
Franklin in the meantime
acquired some divine stature and
godlike insight that legitimizes his
personal dispensation of freedom
to speak in Dinkelspiel? How, in
shouting hown Mr. Lodge, does he
differ from the hardhats whose
use of antimind in New York
caused so much joy in the hearts
of those we jointly oppose? How
does he differ from those equially
desperate antiminds who
prevented Mr. Hickel from
speaking at Princeton last
April—then consider the political
courage Mr. Hickel himself
eventually displayed.
Certainly by his cheap resort to
antimind Professor Franklin
cannot hope to heal the wounds
of a society that owe their origin
largely to a lack of mind in public
affairs: Either he has other goals
in mind totally incompatible with
a university, or if in fact he does
so hope, what has happened to
Stanford's procedures for
screening intellectual
competence? ,
The third issue concerns the
politics of ■reform. That, in its
fullness, obviously transcends the
scope of this letter, but there are
aspects of it that Professor
Franklin and his supporters
evidently fail to see. How, 1 have
been asked, can we condemn

Franklin on the one hand, and at
the same time charge the German
universities with moral dereliction
in the 1930'5? And that I do. I
believe, from what 1 know of the
facts, that the university
community in Germany failed in
its obligation to perceive the
growing evil and combat it. They
were wrong, to say the least, when
they abandoned Thomas Mann
and others as lonely voices crying
out against the growing decay of
their national civilization. They
should at least have tried, by
reasoned public statement and
non-violent, yet mighty,
demonstration, to stir the
conscience of the German people.

But in stating this I am obviously
not suggesting they should have
resorted to the idiocy of shouting
down government officials. Any
university community has gone
mad, indeed, when it resorts to
brute force to fight brute force.
There is evil growing here and
in our own time; and it comes
from many sources—from the
right and from the left. I am one
of many thousands who believe
that individuals in the University
community should seek to define
and fight the roots of that evil.
And the record—far from being all
gloomy—makes it clear that the
universities can be and have been
effective in stirring the national
consicence in recent years. We did
well last May: without the
strength of our protest, we would
still be in Cambodia—or should I
say even more enmeshed than we
still are. But to the extent last
spring's protest succeeded it did
so by its breadth and depth, by
the multitude of sober voices that
cried out, not by the violence of a

lunatic fringe. For antimind on
campus is now a tool in the hands
of our adversaries in the quest for
social reform, and that quest was
set back, not advanced, by Bruce
Franklin's performance in
Dinkelspiel.
I was as angry as Mr. Franklin,
but I have no intention of letting
that emotion so paralyze my mind
that I lose the battle; because the
battle can be won only with
mind—and by a choice of
battleground where the National
Guard and the Sheriff's armed
deputies have" neither access nor
special competence; where the
common sense and decency that
the electorate does possess are
given their chance; and where the
real issues are not blurred by the
behavior of a desperate, deluded
fringe from either inside or
outside the University. I agree
there is cause for despair, but not
for desperation. I know the hour
is late, but it is not too late for
reason to prevail. Aitfl I insist that
the only fu'aire worth
contemplating rejects antimind
wherever it occurs, in Wallace, in
Agnew—and in Bruce Franklin.
Our goal must be to rebuild
faith in reason and in decency as
primary forces in the life of man;
for it is precisely in the loss of
simple decency (even in high
office), and in the loss of reason,
the loss of faith in reason—in the
efficacy of mind—that is
responsible for so much of our
current illness. Given those beliefs
I cannot escape condemning
Bruce Franklin's treatment of
Ambassador Lodge, no matter
what his role in Vietnam; and
given a commitment to political
action, I cannot escape this public
statement of my belief that
Professor Franklin's continued
association with Stanford can
only impair the University's
credibility and effectiveness on
the battleground of its own
choice.

Before pressing my own view
concerning Professor Franklin's
right to continued membership in
the University, let me state some
political views as preamble. I am
disgusted by probably all those
aspects of the contemporary scene
that move Professor Franklin. I
abhor the Vietnam war, as an act
of national rape. Whatever may be
said to explain its gradual
beginnings, its continuation by
the last two administrations rests
on a mixture of stupidity and
hypocricy that boggles the mind. I
am sickened by the image we
present to the world at large: an
incredible concoction of
Nuremberg and Vietnam; of Watts
and SSTs; of officers who,
unembarrassed, declare they
destroyed a village to save it; of a
senior U.S. Senator who wanted
the Defense Budget expanded to
ensure that the few who survived
the holocaust were true-blooded
Americans. I am sickened by that
failure of national leadership
which for 10 years at least has
been either too stupid or too
beholden somewhere to assert a
decent set of goals and priorities;
unable to mobilize adequately the
vast national competence available
to it; and - lets face it - simply
unable to command a broad base
for either trust or respect. I am
tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,

of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance
of power, in its cant and in its
actions, that has alienated a whole
generation of youth from the
democratic institutions on which
civilization rests. Match Johnson's
campaign pledges of 1 96 4 with his
actions in the Tonkin Gulf affair,
and in the ensuing years.
Bruce Franklin, I gather, would
agree with me in all of this. But
there our agreement ends. It is not
enough to say that I deplore his
behavior in Dinkelspiel when Mr.
Lodge attempted to speak there; I
believe it totally incompatible
with the nature and goals of the
University; and as such it
raises—squarely—the question of
his continued right to membership
in the University.
There.' are three issues to
explicate. The first concerns the
facts of the case, and Professor
Franklin has made
these~.su rprisingly-Temarkably
clear. He not only agrees , he
boasts that he deliberately
contributed to the brute noise

which was used in Dinkelspiel to
block Mr. Lodge's speech. On
television he openly regretted he
had, alas, not done more in this
direction. He has then, by his own
public testimony, deliberately
joined in a successful attempt to
prevent someone from stating a
position which, had it been heaid,
could have been debated, and if
found wrong, exposed as such.
The second issue concerns the
nature and function of the
University as a social
institution — as the
institutionalization of mind. It is
the universities who are the
custodians of those precious
human possessions of reason; of

any resort to violence...should
constitute automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University.

the right to skepticism and
debate; of concern for fact, as
well as value; they are indeed
custodian of almost all the things
on which the tenuous state of
civilized man rests crucially. They
should be, and have been, an
embodiment of mind and a
mainspring of cultural evolution.
In this view, the right to be heard
at a university is fundamental, and
the resort to physical blockage of
a statable viewpoint is to be
precluded totally, and without
qualification. Further, I believe
that any resort to violence,
whether in blocking speech, in
trashing or in physically impeding
others from their normal
functions, should constitute
automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University as
soon as the fact has been
established by due process. Nor
can I perceive why, in that due
process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
days when we, the university
faculties (including our radical
colleagues), fought for tenure
precisely to protect freedom of
speech against political
persecution? Or has Professor
Franklin in the meantime
acquired some divine stature and
godlike insight that legitimizes his
personal dispensation of freedom
to speak in Dinkelspiel? How, in
shouting hown Mr. Lodge, does he
differ from the hardhats whose
use of antimind in New York
caused so much joy in the hearts
of those we jointly oppose? How
does he differ from those equially
desperate antiminds who
prevented Mr. Hickel from
speaking at Princeton last
April—then consider the political
courage Mr. Hickel himself
eventually displayed.
Certainly by his cheap resort to
antimind Professor Franklin
cannot hope to heal the wounds
of a society that owe their origin
largely to a lack of mind in public
affairs: Either he has other goals
in mind totally incompatible with
a university, or if in fact he does
so hope, what has happened to
Stanford's procedures for
screening intellectual
competence? ,
The third issue concerns the
politics of ■reform. That, in its
fullness, obviously transcends the
scope of this letter, but there are
aspects of it that Professor
Franklin and his supporters
evidently fail to see. How, 1 have
been asked, can we condemn

Franklin on the one hand, and at
the same time charge the German
universities with moral dereliction
in the 1930'5? And that I do. I
believe, from what 1 know of the
facts, that the university
community in Germany failed in
its obligation to perceive the
growing evil and combat it. They
were wrong, to say the least, when
they abandoned Thomas Mann
and others as lonely voices crying
out against the growing decay of
their national civilization. They
should at least have tried, by
reasoned public statement and
non-violent, yet mighty,
demonstration, to stir the
conscience of the German people.

But in stating this I am obviously
not suggesting they should have
resorted to the idiocy of shouting
down government officials. Any
university community has gone
mad, indeed, when it resorts to
brute force to fight brute force.
There is evil growing here and
in our own time; and it comes
from many sources—from the
right and from the left. I am one
of many thousands who believe
that individuals in the University
community should seek to define
and fight the roots of that evil.
And the record—far from being all
gloomy—makes it clear that the
universities can be and have been
effective in stirring the national
consicence in recent years. We did
well last May: without the
strength of our protest, we would
still be in Cambodia—or should I
say even more enmeshed than we
still are. But to the extent last
spring's protest succeeded it did
so by its breadth and depth, by
the multitude of sober voices that
cried out, not by the violence of a

lunatic fringe. For antimind on
campus is now a tool in the hands
of our adversaries in the quest for
social reform, and that quest was
set back, not advanced, by Bruce
Franklin's performance in
Dinkelspiel.
I was as angry as Mr. Franklin,
but I have no intention of letting
that emotion so paralyze my mind
that I lose the battle; because the
battle can be won only with
mind—and by a choice of
battleground where the National
Guard and the Sheriff's armed
deputies have" neither access nor
special competence; where the
common sense and decency that
the electorate does possess are
given their chance; and where the
real issues are not blurred by the
behavior of a desperate, deluded
fringe from either inside or
outside the University. I agree
there is cause for despair, but not
for desperation. I know the hour
is late, but it is not too late for
reason to prevail. Aitfl I insist that
the only fu'aire worth
contemplating rejects antimind
wherever it occurs, in Wallace, in
Agnew—and in Bruce Franklin.
Our goal must be to rebuild
faith in reason and in decency as
primary forces in the life of man;
for it is precisely in the loss of
simple decency (even in high
office), and in the loss of reason,
the loss of faith in reason—in the
efficacy of mind—that is
responsible for so much of our
current illness. Given those beliefs
I cannot escape condemning
Bruce Franklin's treatment of
Ambassador Lodge, no matter
what his role in Vietnam; and
given a commitment to political
action, I cannot escape this public
statement of my belief that
Professor Franklin's continued
association with Stanford can
only impair the University's
credibility and effectiveness on
the battleground of its own
choice.

Before pressing my own view
concerning Professor Franklin's
right to continued membership in
the University, let me state some
political views as preamble. I am
disgusted by probably all those
aspects of the contemporary scene
that move Professor Franklin. I
abhor the Vietnam war, as an act
of national rape. Whatever may be
said to explain its gradual
beginnings, its continuation by
the last two administrations rests
on a mixture of stupidity and
hypocricy that boggles the mind. I
am sickened by the image we
present to the world at large: an
incredible concoction of
Nuremberg and Vietnam; of Watts
and SSTs; of officers who,
unembarrassed, declare they
destroyed a village to save it; of a
senior U.S. Senator who wanted
the Defense Budget expanded to
ensure that the few who survived
the holocaust were true-blooded
Americans. I am sickened by that
failure of national leadership
which for 10 years at least has
been either too stupid or too
beholden somewhere to assert a
decent set of goals and priorities;
unable to mobilize adequately the
vast national competence available
to it; and - lets face it - simply
unable to command a broad base
for either trust or respect. I am
tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,
and - above all - of the future. I
want, like Bruce Franklin, to
rebel. I want to shake the
establishment into awareness and
effective action. I want an end to
the idiocy of the seniority system
in the Congress. I want a political
mechinery that will face truth and
work with it, will utilize fact and
competence. I want an end to
personal empires in the federal
government - that is, I want J.
Edgar Hoover out. I want an
Attorney General who sees the
law as an instrument of
civilization, of human justice, not
of political power. I want an
honest, realistic program to
achieve racial equality. I want the
Pentagon effectively constrained
by civilian power, and its budget
slashed to divert our resources to
a worldwide Common Cause
whose goals are human happiness
and human beauty, the only goals
worthy of man, and which only
the non-violence of civilization
can bring.
History will see to it that
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon- but especially
Johnson-will face the charge, not
only that they initiated,
perpetrated and perpetuated the
rape of Indochina, but also that in
so doing, they shattered the fabric
of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance

joined in a successful attempt to
prevent someone from stating a
position which, had it been heaid,
could have been debated, and if
found wrong, exposed as such.
The second issue concerns the
nature and function of the
University as a social
institution — as the
institutionalization of mind. It is
the universities who are the
custodians of those precious
human possessions of reason; of

any resort to violence...should
constitute automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University.

the right to skepticism and
debate; of concern for fact, as
well as value; they are indeed
custodian of almost all the things
on which the tenuous state of
civilized man rests crucially. They
should be, and have been, an
embodiment of mind and a
mainspring of cultural evolution.
In this view, the right to be heard
at a university is fundamental, and
the resort to physical blockage of
a statable viewpoint is to be
precluded totally, and without
qualification. Further, I believe
that any resort to violence,
whether in blocking speech, in
trashing or in physically impeding
others from their normal
functions, should constitute
automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University as
soon as the fact has been
established by due process. Nor
can I perceive why, in that due
process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
days when we, the university
faculties (including our radical
colleagues), fought for tenure
precisely to protect freedom of
speech against political
persecution? Or has Professor
Franklin in the meantime
acquired some divine stature and
godlike insight that legitimizes his
personal dispensation of freedom
to speak in Dinkelspiel? How, in
shouting hown Mr. Lodge, does he
differ from the hardhats whose
use of antimind in New York
caused so much joy in the hearts
of those we jointly oppose? How
does he differ from those equially
desperate antiminds who
prevented Mr. Hickel from
speaking at Princeton last
April—then consider the political
courage Mr. Hickel himself
eventually displayed.
Certainly by his cheap resort to
antimind Professor Franklin
cannot hope to heal the wounds
of a society that owe their origin
largely to a lack of mind in public
affairs: Either he has other goals
in mind totally incompatible with
a university, or if in fact he does
so hope, what has happened to
Stanford's procedures for
screening intellectual
competence? ,
The third issue concerns the
politics of ■reform. That, in its
fullness, obviously transcends the
scope of this letter, but there are
aspects of it that Professor
Franklin and his supporters
evidently fail to see. How, 1 have
been asked, can we condemn

Franklin on the one hand, and at
the same time charge the German
universities with moral dereliction
in the 1930'5? And that I do. I
believe, from what 1 know of the
facts, that the university
community in Germany failed in
its obligation to perceive the
growing evil and combat it. They
were wrong, to say the least, when
they abandoned Thomas Mann
and others as lonely voices crying
out against the growing decay of
their national civilization. They
should at least have tried, by
reasoned public statement and
non-violent, yet mighty,
demonstration, to stir the
conscience of the German people.

But in stating this I am obviously
not suggesting they should have
resorted to the idiocy of shouting
down government officials. Any
university community has gone
mad, indeed, when it resorts to
brute force to fight brute force.
There is evil growing here and
in our own time; and it comes
from many sources—from the
right and from the left. I am one
of many thousands who believe
that individuals in the University
community should seek to define
and fight the roots of that evil.
And the record—far from being all
gloomy—makes it clear that the
universities can be and have been
effective in stirring the national
consicence in recent years. We did
well last May: without the
strength of our protest, we would
still be in Cambodia—or should I
say even more enmeshed than we
still are. But to the extent last
spring's protest succeeded it did
so by its breadth and depth, by
the multitude of sober voices that
cried out, not by the violence of a

lunatic fringe. For antimind on
campus is now a tool in the hands
of our adversaries in the quest for
social reform, and that quest was
set back, not advanced, by Bruce
Franklin's performance in
Dinkelspiel.
I was as angry as Mr. Franklin,
but I have no intention of letting
that emotion so paralyze my mind
that I lose the battle; because the
battle can be won only with
mind—and by a choice of
battleground where the National
Guard and the Sheriff's armed
deputies have" neither access nor
special competence; where the
common sense and decency that
the electorate does possess are
given their chance; and where the
real issues are not blurred by the
behavior of a desperate, deluded
fringe from either inside or
outside the University. I agree
there is cause for despair, but not
for desperation. I know the hour
is late, but it is not too late for
reason to prevail. Aitfl I insist that
the only fu'aire worth
contemplating rejects antimind
wherever it occurs, in Wallace, in
Agnew—and in Bruce Franklin.
Our goal must be to rebuild
faith in reason and in decency as
primary forces in the life of man;
for it is precisely in the loss of
simple decency (even in high
office), and in the loss of reason,
the loss of faith in reason—in the
efficacy of mind—that is
responsible for so much of our
current illness. Given those beliefs
I cannot escape condemning
Bruce Franklin's treatment of
Ambassador Lodge, no matter
what his role in Vietnam; and
given a commitment to political
action, I cannot escape this public
statement of my belief that
Professor Franklin's continued
association with Stanford can
only impair the University's
credibility and effectiveness on
the battleground of its own
choice.

Before pressing my own view
concerning Professor Franklin's
right to continued membership in
the University, let me state some
political views as preamble. I am
disgusted by probably all those
aspects of the contemporary scene
that move Professor Franklin. I
abhor the Vietnam war, as an act
of national rape. Whatever may be
said to explain its gradual
beginnings, its continuation by
the last two administrations rests
on a mixture of stupidity and
hypocricy that boggles the mind. I
am sickened by the image we
present to the world at large: an
incredible concoction of
Nuremberg and Vietnam; of Watts
and SSTs; of officers who,
unembarrassed, declare they
destroyed a village to save it; of a
senior U.S. Senator who wanted
the Defense Budget expanded to
ensure that the few who survived
the holocaust were true-blooded
Americans. I am sickened by that
failure of national leadership
which for 10 years at least has
been either too stupid or too
beholden somewhere to assert a
decent set of goals and priorities;
unable to mobilize adequately the
vast national competence available
to it; and - lets face it - simply
unable to command a broad base
for either trust or respect. I am
tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,
and - above all - of the future. I
want, like Bruce Franklin, to
rebel. I want to shake the
establishment into awareness and
effective action. I want an end to
the idiocy of the seniority system
in the Congress. I want a political
mechinery that will face truth and
work with it, will utilize fact and
competence. I want an end to
personal empires in the federal
government - that is, I want J.
Edgar Hoover out. I want an
Attorney General who sees the
law as an instrument of
civilization, of human justice, not
of political power. I want an
honest, realistic program to
achieve racial equality. I want the
Pentagon effectively constrained
by civilian power, and its budget
slashed to divert our resources to
a worldwide Common Cause
whose goals are human happiness
and human beauty, the only goals
worthy of man, and which only
the non-violence of civilization
can bring.
History will see to it that
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon- but especially
Johnson-will face the charge, not
only that they initiated,
perpetrated and perpetuated the
rape of Indochina, but also that in
so doing, they shattered the fabric
of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance
of power, in its cant and in its
actions, that has alienated a whole
generation of youth from the
democratic institutions on which
civilization rests. Match Johnson's
campaign pledges of 1 96 4 with his
actions in the Tonkin Gulf affair,
and in the ensuing years.
Bruce Franklin, I gather, would
agree with me in all of this. But
there our agreement ends. It is not
enough to say that I deplore his
behavior in Dinkelspiel when Mr.
Lodge attempted to speak there; I
believe it totally incompatible
with the nature and goals of the
University; and as such it
raises—squarely—the question of
his continued right to membership
in the University.
There.' are three issues to
explicate. The first concerns the
facts of the case, and Professor
Franklin has made
these~.su rprisingly-Temarkably
clear. He not only agrees , he
boasts that he deliberately
contributed to the brute noise

which was used in Dinkelspiel to
block Mr. Lodge's speech. On
television he openly regretted he
had, alas, not done more in this
direction. He has then, by his own
public testimony, deliberately
joined in a successful attempt to

process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
days when we, the university
faculties (including our radical
colleagues), fought for tenure
precisely to protect freedom of
speech against political
persecution? Or has Professor
Franklin in the meantime
acquired some divine stature and
godlike insight that legitimizes his
personal dispensation of freedom
to speak in Dinkelspiel? How, in
shouting hown Mr. Lodge, does he
differ from the hardhats whose
use of antimind in New York
caused so much joy in the hearts
of those we jointly oppose? How
does he differ from those equially
desperate antiminds who
prevented Mr. Hickel from
speaking at Princeton last
April—then consider the political
courage Mr. Hickel himself
eventually displayed.
Certainly by his cheap resort to
antimind Professor Franklin
cannot hope to heal the wounds
of a society that owe their origin
largely to a lack of mind in public
affairs: Either he has other goals
in mind totally incompatible with
a university, or if in fact he does
so hope, what has happened to
Stanford's procedures for
screening intellectual
competence? ,
The third issue concerns the
politics of ■reform. That, in its
fullness, obviously transcends the
scope of this letter, but there are
aspects of it that Professor
Franklin and his supporters
evidently fail to see. How, 1 have
been asked, can we condemn

Franklin on the one hand, and at
the same time charge the German
universities with moral dereliction
in the 1930'5? And that I do. I
believe, from what 1 know of the
facts, that the university
community in Germany failed in
its obligation to perceive the
growing evil and combat it. They
were wrong, to say the least, when
they abandoned Thomas Mann
and others as lonely voices crying
out against the growing decay of
their national civilization. They
should at least have tried, by
reasoned public statement and
non-violent, yet mighty,
demonstration, to stir the
conscience of the German people.

But in stating this I am obviously
not suggesting they should have
resorted to the idiocy of shouting
down government officials. Any
university community has gone
mad, indeed, when it resorts to
brute force to fight brute force.
There is evil growing here and
in our own time; and it comes
from many sources—from the
right and from the left. I am one
of many thousands who believe
that individuals in the University
community should seek to define
and fight the roots of that evil.
And the record—far from being all
gloomy—makes it clear that the
universities can be and have been
effective in stirring the national
consicence in recent years. We did
well last May: without the
strength of our protest, we would
still be in Cambodia—or should I
say even more enmeshed than we
still are. But to the extent last
spring's protest succeeded it did
so by its breadth and depth, by
the multitude of sober voices that
cried out, not by the violence of a

lunatic fringe. For antimind on
campus is now a tool in the hands
of our adversaries in the quest for
social reform, and that quest was
set back, not advanced, by Bruce
Franklin's performance in
Dinkelspiel.
I was as angry as Mr. Franklin,
but I have no intention of letting
that emotion so paralyze my mind
that I lose the battle; because the
battle can be won only with
mind—and by a choice of
battleground where the National
Guard and the Sheriff's armed
deputies have" neither access nor
special competence; where the
common sense and decency that
the electorate does possess are
given their chance; and where the
real issues are not blurred by the
behavior of a desperate, deluded
fringe from either inside or
outside the University. I agree
there is cause for despair, but not
for desperation. I know the hour
is late, but it is not too late for
reason to prevail. Aitfl I insist that
the only fu'aire worth
contemplating rejects antimind
wherever it occurs, in Wallace, in
Agnew—and in Bruce Franklin.
Our goal must be to rebuild
faith in reason and in decency as
primary forces in the life of man;
for it is precisely in the loss of
simple decency (even in high
office), and in the loss of reason,
the loss of faith in reason—in the
efficacy of mind—that is
responsible for so much of our
current illness. Given those beliefs
I cannot escape condemning
Bruce Franklin's treatment of
Ambassador Lodge, no matter
what his role in Vietnam; and
given a commitment to political
action, I cannot escape this public
statement of my belief that
Professor Franklin's continued
association with Stanford can
only impair the University's
credibility and effectiveness on
the battleground of its own
choice.

Before pressing my own view
concerning Professor Franklin's
right to continued membership in
the University, let me state some
political views as preamble. I am
disgusted by probably all those
aspects of the contemporary scene
that move Professor Franklin. I
abhor the Vietnam war, as an act
of national rape. Whatever may be
said to explain its gradual
beginnings, its continuation by
the last two administrations rests
on a mixture of stupidity and
hypocricy that boggles the mind. I
am sickened by the image we
present to the world at large: an
incredible concoction of
Nuremberg and Vietnam; of Watts
and SSTs; of officers who,
unembarrassed, declare they
destroyed a village to save it; of a
senior U.S. Senator who wanted
the Defense Budget expanded to
ensure that the few who survived
the holocaust were true-blooded
Americans. I am sickened by that
failure of national leadership
which for 10 years at least has
been either too stupid or too
beholden somewhere to assert a
decent set of goals and priorities;
unable to mobilize adequately the
vast national competence available
to it; and - lets face it - simply
unable to command a broad base
for either trust or respect. I am
tired of economic piracy, of the
exploitation of peoples, especially
of minorities, of the earth itself,
and - above all - of the future. I
want, like Bruce Franklin, to
rebel. I want to shake the
establishment into awareness and
effective action. I want an end to
the idiocy of the seniority system
in the Congress. I want a political
mechinery that will face truth and
work with it, will utilize fact and
competence. I want an end to
personal empires in the federal
government - that is, I want J.
Edgar Hoover out. I want an
Attorney General who sees the
law as an instrument of
civilization, of human justice, not
of political power. I want an
honest, realistic program to
achieve racial equality. I want the
Pentagon effectively constrained
by civilian power, and its budget
slashed to divert our resources to
a worldwide Common Cause
whose goals are human happiness
and human beauty, the only goals
worthy of man, and which only
the non-violence of civilization
can bring.
History will see to it that
Presidents Kennedy, Johnson and
Nixon- but especially
Johnson-will face the charge, not
only that they initiated,
perpetrated and perpetuated the
rape of Indochina, but also that in
so doing, they shattered the fabric
of democracy in the United
States. It is the national leadership
of the last decade, in its arrogance
of power, in its cant and in its
actions, that has alienated a whole
generation of youth from the
democratic institutions on which
civilization rests. Match Johnson's
campaign pledges of 1 96 4 with his
actions in the Tonkin Gulf affair,
and in the ensuing years.
Bruce Franklin, I gather, would
agree with me in all of this. But
there our agreement ends. It is not
enough to say that I deplore his
behavior in Dinkelspiel when Mr.
Lodge attempted to speak there; I
believe it totally incompatible
with the nature and goals of the
University; and as such it
raises—squarely—the question of
his continued right to membership
in the University.
There.' are three issues to
explicate. The first concerns the
facts of the case, and Professor
Franklin has made
these~.su rprisingly-Temarkably
clear. He not only agrees , he
boasts that he deliberately
contributed to the brute noise

which was used in Dinkelspiel to
block Mr. Lodge's speech. On
television he openly regretted he
had, alas, not done more in this
direction. He has then, by his own
public testimony, deliberately
joined in a successful attempt to
prevent someone from stating a
position which, had it been heaid,
could have been debated, and if
found wrong, exposed as such.
The second issue concerns the
nature and function of the
University as a social
institution — as the
institutionalization of mind. It is
the universities who are the
custodians of those precious
human possessions of reason; of

any resort to violence...should
constitute automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University.

the right to skepticism and
debate; of concern for fact, as
well as value; they are indeed
custodian of almost all the things
on which the tenuous state of
civilized man rests crucially. They
should be, and have been, an
embodiment of mind and a
mainspring of cultural evolution.
In this view, the right to be heard
at a university is fundamental, and
the resort to physical blockage of
a statable viewpoint is to be
precluded totally, and without
qualification. Further, I believe
that any resort to violence,
whether in blocking speech, in
trashing or in physically impeding
others from their normal
functions, should constitute
automatic forfeiture of
membership in the University as
soon as the fact has been
established by due process. Nor
can I perceive why, in that due
process, a University student or
faculty member should be
presumed so ignorant as to require
reminder of the law- while he
enfringes it—before a charge may
be pressed against him: The
ordinary citizen without the
benefit of higher education is
allowed no such recourse to
ignorance of the law.
What has changed since the
