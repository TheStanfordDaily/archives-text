# Varied Opinions On Franklin Case
## 
### 
open hearing
Editor, THE DAILY:
Since 1 9 6 5 Bruce Franklin has
opposed the Vietnam War and
supported revolutionary groups both in
the class and on the street. He has
done so in the face of a rising tide of
criticism from certain sectors of the
academic community and the Bay Area
establishment. On Monday, January
25 th, he took to the streets in a
peaceful demonstration supporting Los
Siete de la Raza, a group which Bruce
feels is on trial not for its alleged
criminal deeds hut for its political
beliefs and activity. At one point in
the march through Redwood City, a
group of policemen yelling "Get
Franklin!" coverged on Bruce, beat
him, arrested him, and charged him
with felonious assault and battery.
This occurred only a few days after
Bruce had been invited to appear
before President Lyman's Advisory
Board, ostensibly to defend his conduct
in the heckling of Henry Cabot Lodge.
Many members of the Stanford
community suspect, however, that Bruce
is actually in jeopardy for his teaching
and practice of ideas incompatible with
those of the academic and business
establishment. We suspect this because
the proposed penalties are so severe
(suspension and possible loss of tenure),
because the Advisory Board is made up
of tenured faculty members who have
long ago aligned themselves with
Bruce's Critics, but most importantly
because President Lyman has so
disposed the matter that final

jurisdiction lies not with any jury of
Bruce's peers but in the hands of
President Lyman himself, as per
paragraph 15 .b of the "Statement on
Policy of Appointment and Tenure at
Stanford University."
If Bruce's hearing is held in secret,
this suspicion will become for many a
certainty; criticisms which Bruce has
leveled against the American judicial
system for its handling of Los Siete
will be applied to the Stanford judicial
system. We do not feel that this would
be in the best interests of Stanford.
We, as members of this university,
demand as a minimum not only that
this hearing be made open to the
public as per paragraph 15.a of the
same document but also that it be
well-publicized and held in an
auditorium large enough to accomodate
everyone who wishes to attend.

don't fire bruce!
This is an open letter of entreaty to
Pre .dent Lyman to keep Bruce
Franklin at Stanford. Over these past
several years, we Ix>yal and True of
the Iceland Stanford Junior University
Staff (LTLSJUS) have been both
pleased and proud to have a bone fide
go-get-'em Maoist in our faculty. You
are surely aware of the envy of our
sister institutions who do not have such
living traditions in the mold of Doodles
Weaver, Prince Lightfoot, Warren G.
Wonka, and Bruce! Who else could so

effectively unite and mold a trashing
unit from the underprivileged and
deprived youth of South Pasadena,
Glencoe, Exeter and Grlton?
And who else can attract four
television networks on short notice to
cover a brown bag luncheon gala?
Think it over.

faculty apologies
There must be several of us beside
myself who remember that at the
emergency meeting of Academic Council
on April 18, 1969, Professor Howard
Bruce Franklin was shouted down by
several members of the faculty while he
was attempting to address us; after
order was restored, President Pitzer as
Chairman of the meeting ruled that
Professor Franklin must conclude his
remarks in one minute. I wrote
President Pitzer about the incident at
the time, as did Professor Roger
Shepard of Psychology, and I imagine
several others, but to the best of my
knowledge, no public apologies were
issued. Now that several members of
our community have had practice in
writing apologies to a speaker who has
been shouted down, I trust that all
those who apologized to Ambassador
will now make their (belated)
apologies to Professor Franklin for the
disgraceful behavior of some of our
faculty on that sad day in the history
of Stanford.
Unfortunately, it is no longer
possible to drop that affair with

apologies. President Lyman has
indicated to us in clear terms that such
actions may provide appropriate grounds
for disciplinary action, and that we are
expected to identify individuals who
engage in such actions. I therefore urge
those of my colleagues who did not
engage in disruptive activity to try
to recollect who was and was not
shouting on that occasion.
Unfortunately we will not have official
pictures of the demonstrators to use to
refresh our memories, so this is likely
to be an unreliable procedure. We
must therefore rely primarilay on the
Fundamental Standard. Since President
Lyman has indicated that the Advisory
Board to ascertain whether their
participation may warrant one of the
penalties under Paragraph 15 for
"personal conduct substantially
impairing the individual's performance
of his appropriate functions within the
University community ..."

unity of opposites
Kditor, THE DAILY:
A really cool example of the
dialectrical unity of opposites. Professor
H. Bruce Franklin in his letter to
President Lyman demands as public a
hearing as he can get for his action in
helping to prevent Ambassador Lodge
from speaking and being heard by
several hundred people who wanted to
hear him and question him publicly.
