fishing rights
Editor, THE DAILY:
A week ago, the United
States Government took
retaliatory measures against
Ecuador, because of the
capture by the latter of 11
American tuna boats within
Ecuadorian territorial waters.
The news media, as always
presented only the position of
the United States Government.
It is our purpose to inform the
Stanford community of the
actual situation.
In 1 9 5 2 , Ecuador, in a
multilateral agreement with
Chile and Peru, signed the
Declaration of Santiago,
asserting right over 2 00
miles of territorial waters. What
is not usually known is that
there are many countries that
claim territorial water limits
that exceed the 12 miles
recognized by the United States
Government. Among them;
Camerous (18 miles); Ghana,
Pakistan and Ceylon (100
miles); Guinea (130 miles);
Uruguay, Brasil, El Salvador,
Costa Rica, Nicaragua, and
Argentina (200 miles).
In 1951 the International
Court of Justice, in a decission
over the Anglo-Norwegion
fishing controversy said, "There
is a criterion that cannot be
overlooked and whose scope
transcends geographical factors;
that of some economical
interests peculiar to a region
whose reality and importance is
clearly evident. . Such rights,
founded on necessities vital to
the population and confirmed
by old and peaceful uses, ran
be taken legitimately into

account in determining a
boundary.
In this case, the western
coasts of Chile, Peru and
Ecuador, are washed by the
Humboldt cold water current.
While this current is a rich

fishing resource, its coldness, at
the same time, hinders the
formation of clouds,
consequently of rain, which
causes the aridity of these
coasts, whose poor agricultural
conditions make these

countries, more than others,
depend on the sea.
This 200-mile limit however,
allows navigation by boat under
any flag. Also, fishing in this
area is made accessible to any
company as long as they pay
for a permit and follow fishing
regulations. This is done by
many foreign companies that
also use the facilities of the
ports in these countries.
While the United States
Government instructs the
fishing companies not to buy
fishing licenses, which range
from $1000 to $ 1500, it pays
the fines of the pirate boats
captured, which range from
$ 3 0,0 0 0 to $4 0,000, with
taxpayers' money.
It is ironical that while the
United States is "willing" to
give aid to developing nations,
at the same time, it supports
activities and private interests
which lead to the depletion of
the resources of these
countries, reducing their
capacity for development.
