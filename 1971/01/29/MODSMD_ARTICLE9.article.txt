Today's column will explore
the nature of revolutionaries.
What is a revolutionary?
According to Webster a
revolutionary is: one who engages
in a revolution, a favorer of
revolution, and one who
advocates revolutionary doctrine
or principle. According to Mikhail
A. Bakunin, the Russian anarchist,
the revolutionary: "despisesevery
sort of doctrinairism and has
renounced the peaceful scientific
pursuits, leaving them to future
generations. He knows only one
science, the science of
destruction." Joseph Stalin, the
greatest butcher the world has
ever known, said, "You cannot
make a revolution with silk
gloves."
What does this mean in a
practical sense? It means that the
revolutionaries must be willing to
be like Winston Smith in 1984.
They must be willing to kill, burn,
and throw acid in childrens' faces
for the revolution. Looked at in
these parameters the bombing of
Clark Hall and the killing of that
grad student in the Math Research
Center are just what the good
revolutionary should do. Every
person on campus claiming to be a
revolutionary should cheer these
actions.
V. I. Lenin says, "Without a
revolutionary theory there can be
no revolution." This means that
every person who has his theory
and calls himself a revolutionary
should be out working for the
revolution. How much effort is
needed, you ask? Again Bakunin
tells all: "The revolutionist is a
doomed man. He has no personal
interests, no affairs, sentiments,
attachments, property, not even a
name of his own. Everything in
him is absorbed by one exclusive
interest, one thought, one

passionâ€”the revolution."
Therefore every self-styled
revolutionary should be off
campus devoting full time to the
revolution. There should be no
student revolutionaries. Whoever
heard of a part-time
revolutionary? Seems to me that
that is the same as being a little
bit pregnant. What would the
"great" revolutionaries think of
these part-time revolutionaries'?
Well here is Lenin, "If you are not
able to adapt yourself, if you are
not inclined to crawl in the mud
on your belly, you are not a
revolutionary but a chatterbox."
Oh hear the revolutionaries who
want academic amnesty to
participate in the revolution!
Leon Trotsky said, "The
revolution is strong to the extent
to which it is realistic, strategic,
and mathematical." How much
cacophony from the self-styled
revolutionaries in the Seattle 7
have you heard? Is the
performance put on by the Seattle
7 or Chicago 8 an example of
strength? Can you imagine the
"revolutionary heroes" like Mao,
Trot, Lenin, Che, or Fido putting
on such a show? This must be a
revolution in revolutionaries.
A question must be asked here.
What is the difference between a
revolution and an insurrection?
Between a revolutionary and an
insurrectionist? The
Revolutionary War is not an
insurrection because it succeeded.
The Declaration of Independence
gives the right to revolution in
"When in the course of human
events. . but in no document
will you ever find the right to
insurrection. This must be
remembered: a revolution that
fails is an insurrection. Journalist
Gilbert Seldes states, "Inevitable
revolutions which fail go down as

footnotes in history under the
name of treason and riot."
What makes a revolutionary
believe that the authorities, viz.
the establishment, will sit back
and let the revolution proceed
unhampered? If the authorities
take some action to stop them,
hear the cry, "Mommie, Mommie,
he hit back." Can these
revolutionaries be so stupid as to
believe that the establishment will
not protect itself? How puerile
can you get?
But one last question. What
oracle has revealed to the
revolutionaries that they have any
legal rights? Do they really believe
that the system they are trying to
destroy should protect them?
Why should it? The true
revolutionary neither has nor
desires these protections; the
chatterbox has no need either
(because they don't need
protection except from
themselves), but make the
pretense of needing them.
Wouldn't Lenin be proud of our
local crop of chatterboxes?
