Today In The 'Daily 9
Today is the first of February.
It is also the first issue of volume 159. You can tell it's a new
volume - we've got a new flag again.
Thirty-three years ago today 200 students broke up the
regimental tell of the Roosevelt High School cadets with a sit-down
strike against waltzes.
We think our new editor will have some better issues than that.
But, to go on to greater heights, we need lots of help. If you're
at all interested in becoming a student journalist - a member of the
honored fourth estate - come to our lunch tomorrow.
