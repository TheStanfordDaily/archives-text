# SJC Hearing
## Lyman Suspends 4 For Contempt 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
President Lyman suspended four
students Friday for contempt of the
chair that day at their hearing before
the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
The four are among seven currently
being charged with disrupting Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech here Jan. 11.
Prof. H. Bruce Franklin was also
cited for contempt at Friday's hearing
which was recessed after three and a
half hours in the wake of outbursts
from the defendants and the gallery.
President Lyman said he suspended the
students "after receiving a letter from
Prof. Williams recommending such
action and after listening to relevant
portions of the tapes of the hearing."
Lyman pointed out that the
suspensions last only until the end of
the hearing so that the penalties are
only intended to expedite the case.

The suspended students are: Gerry
Foote, sophomore, general studies;
Mike Holman, sophomore, general
studies; Janet Weiss, graduate, English;
and Jeff Youdelman, graduate English.
President Lyman said Friday that he
was still considering Franklin's case.
At the beginning of Friday's hearing,
over 100 people gathered outside
Room 161-J of the Law School which
had been filed with about 100
spectators half an hour before the trial
was scheduled to begin. Many of those
in the hall tried to force their way in,
and all were finally admitted to the
room after four spectators pushed past
University police guarding the door.
Once those who had been outside
gained entrance, the gallery remained
relatively quiet for the first three hours
of the hearing.

In the opening minutes of the
hearing the defense succeeded in having
•tfl armed persons barred from the
room.
Then followed a three-hour voirdire,
a legal procedure in which the defense
examined members of the SJC for
possible prejudice in judging the case.
It was after the close of the voirdire
that the contempt citations were
issued, and the hearing was recessed.
Williams had just announced the SJC
had disqualified none of its members
from hearing the case. Defendant Janet
Weiss then challenged William's ability
to adjucate the case fairly.
While Williams was attempting to
poll the Council on Weiss's challenge,
Prof. Franklin stated that he wished to
argue the case. Defendant Jeff
Youdelman had designated Franklin his
co-counsel at the beginning of the
hearing.
Williams informed Franklin that
discussion on the matter was closed and
once again tried to poll the Council on
Weiss's motion.
Franklin continued to insist that he
wished to raise an objection, at which
point Williams declared Franklin in
violation of the Chairman's orders.
Defendant Gerry Foote shouted into
the mike at Williams, "I find you in
violation! I object!"
Defendant Mike Holman then
shouted, "Let it be said that we're
trying to make a defense and we're not
being allowed to!"
Williams then issued contempt
citations to Foote and Holman.
A few minutes later, defense counsel
Walter Hunkeler asked Williams for a

clarification on the SJC's jurisdiction
over Prof. Franklin. Williams said that
under section G, paragraph one of the
SJC charter, he had complete control
over courtroom decorum and was
allowed to impose sanctions against any
person therein.
He added that Mr. Franklin was a
person.
"And a far better one than you,"
responded Weiss.
At this point, Weiss was cited for
contempt.
It was then that Youdelman, who
had been trying to gain the floor during
the preceeding exchanges, began asking
Williams why he was being ignored.
After several entreaties by Williams
for Youdelman to remain silent,
Williams cited Youdelman for
contempt.
"I find you in contempt of the
peoples of the world, Fascist pig,"
responded Youdelman to cheers and
shouts from the gallery.
Following this outburst, Williams
recessed the hearing.
In a statement released Saturday,
the SJC said that the next hearing in
the Lodge case will be Monday,
February 8 at a place to be announced.
The statement also said, "Admission of
spectators will be restricted to a limited
number of persons selected by the
defendants, the University
administration, or the Council."
In other developments concerning
the case, Williams's house has been
placed under 24-hour guard after four
teenage youths were stopped Friday
night dropping rocks in the driveway of
the Williams home.


OVER THE TOP—As spectators gathered outside the SJC hearing room, one
determined onlooker decides to get a better view. As the following pictures show,
she gets a closer look than she bargained for, going head first into the chambers.
