## Free Speech, Due Process 
### 
While the issue surrounding the
Lodge Disruptions becomes more
confused daily, I offer the
following in an attempt to clarify
the issues.
The primary substantive issue
is whether freedom of speech will
be maintained on the campus. No
person should be allowed to deny
another his right of free speech. A
small group of hecklers prevented
Mr. Lodge from exercising his
right to speak in Dinkelspiel last
January 11. The only question is
how to prevent a similar
occurence in the future.
There are really only two
means of preserving free speech
on the campus: one is by police
action at the time of the incident
and the other is by the subsequent
disciplining of those who
participated in the abridgment of
this right. The latter seems by far
the better method. Police action
at the time of the incident poses
many problems of arbitrary and
summary punishment and possible
injury to innocent spectators. An
orderly hearing subsequent to the
act assures the accused a full
explanation and defense of his
conduct, proof beyond a
reasonable doubt of infraction of
established rules of conduct, and
punishment suited to his
prohibited action if found guilty.
Far from representing repression,
subsequent disciplinary action is
the best available means for
preventing repression of free
speech by any group.
A second issue that has been
raised is whether the appropriate
procedures have been followed in
charging the accused, especially
with respect to Bruce Franklin.
The SJC has never had
authority over faculty disciplinary
cases. TTie Academic Senate in
1968 did vote its willingness to
extend original jurisdiction by the
SJC in the specific cases of faculty
violation of the disruption policy.
However, such an alteration in
the SJC charter was never
proposed by the C-15, a necessary
step in the creation of this
jurisdiction.
The resolution, therefore, has
no more effect than to indicate
the sentiment of the Academic
Senate in 1 9 68. To argue
otherwise is to say ihat the

faculty alone have the power to
alter the SJC charter without
consultation with studentsâ€”a
position completely contrary to
the Charter.
The result is that neither Bruce
Franklin nor any other faculty
member is under the jurisdiction
of the SJC. The appropriate
procedure for the disciplining of
H. Bruce Franklin was precisely
the one taken. The President
notified Franklin of the
disciplinary action proposed and
appeal of the decision is before
the Advisory Board at Franklin's
request.
The third major issue concerns
the disruption of the SJC hearings
themselves. The only way that the
SJC can function without
prejudice or unfairness to the
defendents is by maintaining an
orderly proceeding.
To assure that this orderliness
is maintained the chairman of the

Robert grant

SJC is granted authority to cite
for contempt of court persons
disrupting the proceedings.
Students may be suspended from
school for contempt. Under this
authority, four students were
suspended and one faculty
member cited for contempt last
Friday.
If the SJC is prevented from
functioning by disruptive
activities in the hearing room,
there is only one likely result and
that is the abandonment of the
SJC.
While this may be the result
some would like to achieve, the
real losers will be the student
body. Some mechanism must be
provided to preserve the right of
free speech, among other rights,
on this campus. The SJC is the
fairest and most impartial
mechanism yet developed. The
SJC should be supported in the
face of its present difficulties.
