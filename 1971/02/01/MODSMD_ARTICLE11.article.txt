## One Black Man's View Of SJC 
### 
My current view of any judicial system is
colored by my present and ultimate
responsibility to the black community.
When the black man looks at a judicial
system he sees a history of
unfairnessâ€”unfairness which has contravened
every one of our sacred notions about freedom
of speech and assembly. Travesties of justice
have been going on for centuries in the trial of
blacks, in the many questionable arrests, in the
highly suspect deaths recently of black
militants by police gunfire. Thus, there is little
in the history of how courts have dealt with
my people which lead me to repose great
confidence in judicial systems.
Holding such views, there was clearly a
constant conflict as I sat on the SJC last vear.
I emerged from my short tenure with
several definite impressions. Like governmental
courts, the quality of the proceedings depends
to a great extent on the personality of the
Chairman. Professor Marc Franklin, who
chaired last year's Council, created an
atmosphere of fairness which mitigated the
political nature of many of the proceedings.
The Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968

(Section II (B) (1) (a)) provides for a Chairman
"appointed by the Resident from the faculty
of the Law School, after consuiatation with
the Dean of the School of Law and after
consultation in at least two meetings with the
SJC in which the SJC shall have the
opportunity to express its preference."
Although the student and faculty Council
members were allowed a voice in Professor
Franklin's selection, we could only make a
recommendation. As a judge is subject to
election by the people, I feel that the
Chairman of the SJC should also be subject to
a University vote.
I can also appreciate the fact that a
Chairman knowledgable of the law is more
likely to ensure that defendant's rights are
protected. However, because of the supposed
informal nature of the proceedings, I believe
that there are many other faculty in the
University who could do a comparable job.
Thus, I would recommend that the
chairmanship be opened up to the entire
faculty, rather than limited to the Law School.
Perhaps in this way we may get a person who
is willing to serve rather than drafting a law
professor.

My final impression is that the decisions of
the SJC should be final, subject to an appeal to
a higher authority, rather than merely
recommendations to the President. In the past
the SJC's action have been functionally final,
because the President has not overruled or
altered its decisions (to my knowledge).
Several of the members of last years Council
shared this view and resolved to resign if the
President did overrule the SJC. The only
legitimate reason for the Presidential veto is to
preserve his control over every facet of campus
activity. However, for the President to assume
in a given case that the SJC had made an
incorrect finding of fact or law without giving
either the defendant or the SJC the
opportunity to present opposing arguments
has a potential for undermining the entire
legitimacy of the SJC.
The views I have expressed are not unique
to me. They are shared by many. Perhaps
students should discuss these types of changes,
especially when the changes relate to a body
which has the power to expell a student, thus
jeopardizing his entire future.
