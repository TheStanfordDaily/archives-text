## Judicial Process Control 
### 
Can the Stanford judicial system survive? This is
a frequent question these days, prompting an
analysis of the present Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC). The most obvious challenge to it concerns
the fact that all defendants are students, while the
SJC is composed of both faculty and students.
This system, however, was not chosen purely on
its own merits, but as an alternative to the previous
one. The Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
was hastily put together and adopted following a
spring judicial controversy leading to the first Old
Union sit-in. Judicial reform had long been under
discussion, but with this added pressure, the new
Charter was quickly adopted. The SJC then replaced
the Interim Judicial Body (IJB) and the Student
Judicial Council.
The old system had an all faculty council, the
IJB, and an all student council, with the Dean of
Students retaining the right to appeal student
acquittals to the faculty body. The new SJC is
composed of both faculty and students, with
jurisdiction over student cast's. Despite a Senate
resolution of October, 1 968 , placing the faculty
under the jurisdiction of the SJC in cases involving a
violation of the Campus Disruption Policy, it-now
appears that this resolution is not a binding one.
Implicit in the old system was the assumption
that students should be included somehow in the
judicial process, but that it was necessary to keep
them under faculty control. The belief that
someone must act in loco parentis over the students
was thus incorporated into the old system by
allowing acquittals to be appealed to the faculty
body.

Less obvious, but no less present, is the same
attitude in the current structure. The four faculty
members are chosen by the Senate of the Academic
Council, that is, by their own constituency. The
four students, on the other hand, are chosen by the
Student Selection Committee, which is composed of
two professors and four students.
In an individual student SJC hearing, therefore,
the defendant is in a complicated situation,
particularly when the case involves an alleged
classroom disruption or something similar.
Unknown to the defendant, more is involved than
his innocence or guilt. At stake is a tradition of
respect for classroom decorum and the dignity of
the professor. It is for this reason that faculty
members are so concerned about student discipline.
Do not students, however, have an equally valid
claim to participation in faculty discipline as
members of the total Stanford community?
The question, obviously, is one of community
discipline versus peer group allegiance. Stanford
could adopt two separate, autonomous judicial
bodies, one for faculty and one for students, or it
could place both faculty and students under the
jurisdiction of a single, joint council. I prefer the"
latter choice. The present judicial system smply
reflects the hierarchy of privilege which now exists.
To place professors subject to the same scrirtiny as
students would hopefully put them on a more equal
footing. The result should be that the parental role
of the faculty and the token role of the students
would both be abandoned.
