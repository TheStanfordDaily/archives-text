## Old Wine In New Bottles 
### 
The all-faculty Interim Judicial
Board (IJB) was replaced less than
three years ago by the
student-faculty Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) because of
injustices in the old judicial
system. While the old system was
being replaced, its chief defenders
were claiming that there was
nothing inherently wrong with
ihat system. Those defenders
included Provost Dick Lyman and
I JB Chairman Howie Williams,
with IJB member Gerry Meier at
Williams' right hand.
The cases which led to the
change in the judicial system were
political cases (protests against
CIA recruiting and Selective
Service exams). During the
hearings for those cases
precedent-breaking decisions were
made that allowed trials to be
held without defendants present,
changed the rules that defined
who could be tried, and gave the
judges the right to make rules on
an ad hoc basis. The
administration provided a
prosecutor (the Dean of Students)
who said his duty was to protect
the students whom the
administration charged with
committing crimes.
New Judicial System
The new judicial system (The
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968) was supposed to remedy
the defects in the old system.
Students were included in the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) which was
established to promulgate rules
and regulations. Students were
also included in the SJC which
could not promulgate its own
rules and regulations, but could
only adjudicate those
promulgated by the SCLC.
The SJC was a non-adversary
(i.e., no prosecutor) commission
system which had a Judicial Aide
who reported the facts of each
case. Where the facts were in
dispute, the complainant or the
defendant could demand hearings
before the SJC. The role of the
President was relegated to cases
involving "extraordinary

circumstances." Students were
assured of hearings before the SJC
before any sanctions could be
imposed in disciplinary cases. The
Committee of Fifteen was given
the power to propose
amendments to the Charter.
It appeared that the new
system might work as the faculty
made an effort to have the same
judicial policies apply to both
faculty and students. However,
this state of affairs did not last
long.
SJC Abrogates Charter
The SJC unilaterally amended
the Judicial Charter. First, it
eliminated the Judicial Aide
required by Article 11, Section C
of the Charter. Second, it issued
its own rules which amended
various sections of the Charter,
including the one which provides
sanctions for refusal to cooperate
with the SJC.
The application of judicial
policies to faculty members
(originally recommended by the
President) was quietly
undermined with the claim (by
the President) that there were no
provisions in the Chartet for
faculty disciplinary cases and that
attempts to write amendments to
the Charter to provide for such
cases were unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, the SJC switched
to an adversary system (with a
paid University prosecutor, but
with no public defender) despite
the fact that there are no
provisions in the Charter for
adversary proceedings and that
attempts to write amendments to
the Charter to provide for such
proceedings were unsuccessful.
The SJC and the President
violated the Charter by creating
regulations in several
unauthorized ways. These
included the promulgation of SJC
rules; the disciplining of student
defendants and their counsel by
the SJC without a hearing before
the SJC; and Presidential
proclamations which provided for
the closing of buildings,
suspended students without a
hearing, defined which campus

meetings are open and which are
closed, and restricted student,
faculty, and staff involvement in
conventional electoral politics.
The evidence indicates that
after three years the judicial
system seems to be in the same
state it was when the first Old
Union sit-in terminated the IJB
and created the SJC and the
SCLC. Why has this occurred?
SJC Equals IJB
The judicial system has evolved
from hearings before the Dean of
Students, through student judicial
councils and the IJB, to the SJC
and the SCLC. However,
whatever forms the judicial
system takes, its purpose remains
the same: to insulate the
administration from blame for
disciplinary actions and to punish
those who challenge the
administration's authority. Those
of us who have witnessed the
metamorphosis of the judicial
system have come to believe that
"the more things change the more
they stay the same;" or as Henry
Cabot Lodge might say "the SJC
is just old wine in new bottles."
Three years ago Dick Lyman
said, "The establishment of new
legislative and judicial structures
in the area of student conduct is
of central importance to the
future of this institution." In less
than three years Lyman has
succeeded in disestablishing the
very structures he pledged to
support on May 9,1 968.
We believe that the sanctity of
the Charter must be reestablished
if there is to be any semblence of
fairness in student disciplinary
cases. Further, we believe that the
Charter must be amended if we
are to prevent the President and
the SJC from exercising authority
that is clearly prohibited to them
by the Charter.
Reform the Judicial System
First, the President must be
removed from the judiciary
branch of University government.
Decisions of the SJC as to verdict
and penalty should be final,
except that the President should
retain the authority of any chief
executive to commute sentences
and pardon convicted students.
Second, the President should
not have the power to unilaterally
promulgate regulations, adjudicate
alleged violations of regulations,
or reject amendments to the
Charter. The SCLC should be the
only body which can promulgate
regulations and the SJC should be
the only body which can
adjudicate alleged violations of
those regulations. Amendments to
the Charter should need the
approval of only those groups of
persons under the jurisdiction of
the Charter.
Third, the Chairman of the SJC
should not have a vote, and a
guilty verdict should require a
majority vote of the total voting
membership of the SJC.
Fourth, the SJC should be a
jury of peers. If both students and
faculty can be tried by the SJC,
both groups should be represented
on the SJC. If only students can
be tried by the SJC, the SJC
should consist of only students.
Where the SJC consists of
representatives of more than one
constituency, at least half the SJC
should be from the defendant's
constituency. Representatives of
a constituency on the SJC
should be chosen by that
constituency.

Fifth, the Charter should
specify the time limit for filing
charges, and the time limit for
prosecuting charges once they are
filed.
(Herb Borock is
Parliamentarian of the Student
Senate. Yale M. Braunstein was
the last defendant to appear
before the 1JB.)
