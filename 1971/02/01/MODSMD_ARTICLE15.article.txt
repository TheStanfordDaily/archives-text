# Sixth Straight
## Dribblers Lose Again 
### BILL CLASTER 
It happened against Princeton,
Villanova, and UCLA. And last
Friday night at Maples Pavilion it
happened against Santa Clara. In
what has become almost standard
form this season, Stanford's
basketball team fell behind,
rallied, but still ended up losing.
After trailing 52 -4 4 at
halftime, the Indians made an
impressive comeback and took a
7 0-63 lead with about eight
minutes left to play. The rally was
sparked by a tenacious zone
defense which held the Broncos to
a mere eleven points in twelve
minutes.
Individual star for the Cards
was rarely-used reserve guard
Darrell Fregia, who scored a quick
ten points in just a few minutes of
action. After he left the game,
Stanford's lead of seven points
soon became a defecit of eight, as
Santa Clara outscored the Cards
by fifteen points in the last eight
minutes.
The game was marred by 5 4

personal fouls. Two players fouled
out for each team, and a total of
six players all accumulated four
fouls. Stanford actually lost the
game at the foul line, as they
missed twelve free throws, some
of which came in crucial one and
one situations.
Top scorer and rebounder for
the Indians was Mike Michel with
20 points and 14 rebounds. Santa
Clara was paced by Mike Stewart,
6-10 sophomore center, who
scored 18 points. Stewart
combined with forward Marc
Peterson for an amazing 25 out of
28 free throws.
Stanford's sixth loss in a row,
dropped their season record to
4-12, and it will be difficult to

improve on it against the tough
competition the Pac-8 will provide
for the remainder of the season.
Stanford's fine freshmen team
suffered their first loss Saturday
night as the San Jose State Frosh
defeated them 81-80. Friday night
the Papooses (9-1) beat Santa
Clara's freshmen 78 -65 .
In the Santa Clara game, center
Mike Mann had twenty points and
15 rebounds. Reserve guard
John Regel added 15 points.
Friday night both the varsity and
freshmen travel to Berkeley to
face Cal. Saturday afternoon the
Indians will host the Bears in a TV
game at 2:30, followed by a
freshmen game at 6 :00.

TAKING A LOOK—Stanford guard Darrell Fregia works against Santa
Clara's Wilbur Miles in action Friday night at Maples Pavilion. The
seldom used Indian guard scored 10 points to lead an Indian rally in
the second half, but the Broncos came back to win 81-73.
It happened against Princeton,
Villanova, and UCLA. And last
Friday night at Maples Pavilion it
happened against Santa Clara. In
what has become almost standard
form this season, Stanford's
basketball team fell behind,
rallied, but still ended up losing.
After trailing 52 -4 4 at
halftime, the Indians made an
impressive comeback and took a
7 0-63 lead with about eight
minutes left to play. The rally was
sparked by a tenacious zone
defense which held the Broncos to
a mere eleven points in twelve
minutes.
Individual star for the Cards
was rarely-used reserve guard
Darrell Fregia, who scored a quick
ten points in just a few minutes of
action. After he left the game,
Stanford's lead of seven points
soon became a defecit of eight, as
Santa Clara outscored the Cards
by fifteen points in the last eight
minutes.
The game was marred by 5 4

personal fouls. Two players fouled
out for each team, and a total of
six players all accumulated four
fouls. Stanford actually lost the
game at the foul line, as they
missed twelve free throws, some
of which came in crucial one and
one situations.
Top scorer and rebounder for
the Indians was Mike Michel with
20 points and 14 rebounds. Santa
Clara was paced by Mike Stewart,
6-10 sophomore center, who
scored 18 points. Stewart
combined with forward Marc
Peterson for an amazing 25 out of
28 free throws.
Stanford's sixth loss in a row,
dropped their season record to
4-12, and it will be difficult to

improve on it against the tough
competition the Pac-8 will provide
for the remainder of the season.
Stanford's fine freshmen team
suffered their first loss Saturday
night as the San Jose State Frosh
defeated them 81-80. Friday night
the Papooses (9-1) beat Santa
Clara's freshmen 78 -65 .
In the Santa Clara game, center
Mike Mann had twenty points and
15 rebounds. Reserve guard
John Regel added 15 points.
Friday night both the varsity and
freshmen travel to Berkeley to
face Cal. Saturday afternoon the
Indians will host the Bears in a TV
game at 2:30, followed by a
freshmen game at 6 :00.
