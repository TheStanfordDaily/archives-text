# Cards 17 BATS 8

### CLIFF NANCARROW 
It's too bad that Stewart
Wilson won't remember more of
Saturday's rugby game. Kicked in
the head early in the first half, the
inside center spent the better part
of eighty minutes trying to shake
loose the cobwebs, while his
mates were putting it to the
BATS, 17-3, in a game that gave
the Indians a big boost towards
capturing a second national
championship.
The BATS posed perhaps the
biggest threat on the Stanford
schedule coming into Saturday's
match, but the Tribe finally put it
all together, combining good
passing with strong scrum play
and thinking rugby to extend
their season's record to 4 -0.
The BATS jumped out to a 5 -0
lead when the ball took a crazy
bounce over Jack Shultz's
shoulder, and the pursuing BATS
winger gathered it in and carried it
across the goal line for a try.
The Indians came right back
when Don Bunce faked a handoff
to Chip Greening cutting back
across the grain and pitched to
Jim Kauffman who broke a tackle
and scooted under the posts for a
try, Kip Oxman's conversion was
good to tie the score 5 -5 .
Oxman added a penalty kick
after Bunce had joined Wilson on
the sidelines with a twisted ankle,
but the BATS evened it up on an
unconverted try early in the
second period.
Concentration and intense
pursuit by the Stanford forwards
began to pay off as, controlling
the ball in the loose rucks, they
enabled scrum half Jim Squeri to
break loose for a score midway
through the period. Jack Shultz
added a try on a great run down
the far sideline, and Wade Killefer
capped the scoring when he
banged his way across the goal
line just as the referee whistled
full time.
