Battle In East LA
LOS ANGELES — One man was killed, 3 0 stores looted
and two buildings destroyed by fire yesterday in a
disturbance following a Mexican-American rally to protest
the Indochina war and alleged police brutality.
The vandalism erupted as youthful demonstrators
marched from the rally, ignoring pleas from rally sponsors
to go home.
It was the third major outbreak of violence in East Los
Angeles since rioting followed a similar protest last Aug.
29.
About 1,000 sheriff's deputies in flak jackets and
helmets were called into the area as firemen, occasionally
pelted by rocks from youths in the area, attempted to put
out the major blazes.
Trouble initially flared when the three-hour rally ended
as about 1,000 ralliers marched on a nearby sheriff's
substation.
Some of them hurled rocks, breaking the windshields of
at least three patrol cars. Rally organizers and monitors
quelled the outburst and dispersed the crowd after 15
minutes, but violence broke out less than an hour later
about six blocks away.
The dead man, who was unidentified, was 2 0 to 25 years
old and apparently had been shot in the head and chest by
a shotgun. Deputies quelling the violence had fired
shotguns.
A spokesman for a group of volunteer doctors which
staffed three medical aid stations in a riot-torn East Los
Angeles said Sunday night he'd never seen worse injuries
resulting from a demonstration.
US Jets Bomb Supply Lines
SAIGON — The U.S. Air Force sent as many as 30 B5 2
stratofortresses over the Ho Chi Minh Trail in southern
Uos yesterday with up to 900 tons of bombs to drop on
major North Vietnamese supply points.
The sustained aerial campaign, now in its 114 th day,
showed no signs of letting up. The Trail is the No. 1

objective of the U.S. Command, since other routes to
South Vietnam are closed to Hanoi's supply convoys.
Between 300 and 4 00 smaller combat planes joined the
eight-engine B5 2's in around-the-clock raids on the
200-mile network of jungle trails.
Secretary of State William P. Rogers told a Washington
news conference Friday that North Vietnam was building
up large supply stockpiles in the southern Panhandle of
Laos, apparently for attacking South Vietnam.
But Western military sources in Vientiane, Laos' capital,
reported Sunday that they know of no extraordinary
North Vietnamese buildup in the Panhandle.
Israelis Raid Lebanon
TEL AVIV — Israeli raiders crossed into southern Lebanon
last night, attacking two guerrilla strongholds and blowing
up a number of houses, the Israeli military command
announced Monday.
One Israeli soldier was killed and three wounded in the
clash with Arab defenders, a spokesman said. He reported
the guerrillas also suffered a number of casualties.
The Israeli command said there had been 10 guerrilla
attacks on Israeli civilian targets along the border since Jan.
10. It was the second Israeli assault against guerrillas in
Lebanon in a fortnight. Israeli soldiers struck two guerrilla
bases near Sarafand on the mediterranean coast Jan. 16.
Berlin Telephones Jammed
BERLIN — Telephone service between East and West
Berlin resumed yesterday after a lapse of 19 years and the
lines were immediately jammed by calls of old friends and
relatives separated by Cold War politics.
Officials said that in less than three hours after service
resumed at 6 a.m. all 760 calls that could be handled during
the day had been booked. The charge was six cents for the
three minute maximum.
Only 10 telephone lines were available, five each in East
and West Berlin, compared to a total of almost 4,000 when
the Communists cut the service in 1 952 .
