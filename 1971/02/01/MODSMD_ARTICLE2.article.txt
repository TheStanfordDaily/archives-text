# Verbal Free-For-All Shatters Calm Veneer

### DAN BERNSTEIN Commentary 
The groundrules were simple.
Picture-taking was forbidden,
cigarette-smoking was out, and
everybody was subject to the university
policy on campus disruptions. In order
to conduct a hearing with the necessary
decorum, Professor Howard Williams,
Chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council, deemed these sanctions to be
necessary.
Teresa Remirez, one of the seven
defendants at last Friday's hearing,
echoed Williams' call for order as she
urged an audience of about 130 to
"ignore minor acts of piggishness." But
she borrowed the words of e.e.
cummings to foreshadow the tumult
that would force the hearing to recess:
"There is some shit I will not eat."
On the surface, Friday's hearing was
called to try the seven students who
were accused of allegedly disrupting an
attempted speech by Henry Cabot
Lodge. But throughout the proceeding,
there was an underlying sensation that
the SJC was on trial.
When Williams informed the
capacity audience of 130 of the
groundrules that were to be followed,
the radical element had not yet arrived
at 161-J and everyone knew it. Tension
mounted moments later as the radicals
assembled outside the open, but
guarded door and chanted a
football-style "fascism" spell-out.
Just like the night before, some of
the more aggressive students challenged
the right of' the police to block the
doorway. Just like the night before, the
challenge was successful, and nearly
100 students flowed into the room.
Had the council been pushed too Car?
Had the hearing been disrupted beyond
all control? This was one of the several
times that the SJC was called upon not
to decide the fate of the defendants,
but to determine the durability of the
judicial system. After lengthy
discussion, Williams ruled that the
hearing could continue.
In an effort to establish an elaborate
defense which encompassed war crimes
and communism, the defendants posed
a variety of questions ranging from "are
you opposed to the principles and
doctrine of communism?" to "do you
believe that the United States is
committing genocide in the Third
World?"
Tempers flared on both sides as the
questions were met with cries of
irrelevance or the raised eyebrows and
rolling eyeballs of Williams.
Williams continually threatened to
find both the defendants and their
counsel in contempt. The defendants
responded by threatening to do the
same to Williams.
At the close of the voir-dire,
Williams refused to submit to what he
judged to be a delaying tactic by the
defense, and ruled an objection by
defense counsel H. Bruce Franklin out
of order. When Franklin persisted in his

objection, Williams managed to out-yell
him, and found him in contempt.
The room exploded.
Cries of "fascist" and
"motherfucker" pierced the judicial air,
and the hearing became a verbal
free-for-all. When defendant Janet
Weiss jumped to her feet, Williams, who
was in the process of polling the
council on her motion to disqualify
him from the hearing, told her that she
was in contempt.
"You can't do that to her! You're a
fascist dog!" cried an irate female voice
from the audience. In rapid succession,
three more defendants were found in
contempt. Patience and restraint had
reached their limits on both sides.
Williams hastily adjourned the hearing.
