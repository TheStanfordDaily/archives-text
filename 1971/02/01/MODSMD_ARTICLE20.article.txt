# Fire Destroys Temple
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
A three-alarm fire that took two and
a half hours to bring under control
gutted the Palo Alto Masonic Temple
on University Avenue early Friday
evening. Damage to the three-story
building in downtown Palo Alto was
put at $500,0 00 by fire officials.
Palo Alto Batalion Chief Ted
Pearson estimated structure damage at
60 per cent and said that the building
might have to be torn down.
The cause of the five is still
undetermined, however, Inspector
Robert Cleveland reported Saturday
that arson had just about been ruled
out. The blaze started in a large
meeting room.
A Palo Alto policeman reported the
fire at 5 :11 p.m. and the first fire units
arrived two minutes later to find
smoke coming from the roof and third
floor windows.
Flames quickly broke thru third
floor windows and the second and third
alarms were sounded. Firemen
speculated that the fire may have been
burning in the attic for some time
before it was noticed.
Almost 60 firemen using two aerial
ladder trucks and six pumpers battled
the stubborn blaze for seven hours
before it was totally extinguished.
Operating under a mutual aid plan,
fire trucks from Stanford, Los Altos
and Mountain View were sent to man
empty Palo Alto stations. One pumper
and an aerial ladder truck from the
Stanford Fire Dept. responded at 5 :2i>
p.m. The ladder truck was deployed at
the fire at 5:45 p.m. just before the
roof of the building collapsed.

There were no serious injuries
reported, although five firemen were
treated at the scene for cuts and
puneture wounds.
Thousands of spectators gathered in
the downtown area to watch the big
blaze as flames shot 30 feet into the air
above the building. Police closed
University Avenue and put up rope
barriers to keep the crowd at a safe
distance.

After the roof fell on top of the
third floor, a Stanford fireman and a
Palo Alto fireman manning extension
ladders from the two aerial trucks
stood in dense smoke and poured water
down into the building. A high-pressure
nozzle on a pumper systematically
knocked out windows on the lower
floors with a powerful stream of water
so that firemen tending hoses on the
ground could get more water into the
building.
