# Yale Adopts Tuition Deferral
## 
### BILL EVERS News Analysis 
Last Saturday, the trustees of Yale
University approved a mechanism
which allows students to finance their
education through a plan similar to
paying an income tax for several
decades.
In late November 1 970, President
Lyman appointed a task force headed
by Business School Dean Arjay Miller
to study whether a finance plan like
Yale's should be an option for Stanford
students especially those attending
Stanford's graduate professional
schools. Some preliminary findings of
this task force have already been
presented to the University's board of
trustees, and a more fleshed-out, more
concrete proposal will be made public
in the next two weeks, according to
Miller.
The finance plan for deferring
tuition payment at Yale is a variant of
what is called the Zacharias plan, after
Professor Jerrold R. Zacharias of
M.1.T., who headed a 1 967 Presidential
panel which recommended financing
higher education on an equity rather
than a bond basis.
As Dean Miller pointed out in an
interview with The Daily last night, "all
of education is investment in human
capital." The Zacharias plan offers
students the opportunity to pay over
an extended period of time for their
higher schooling out the higher income
their schooling will allow them to earn,
instead of those students' obtaining a
straight dollar loan and then paying so
much per month over a short period of
time.
Under Yale's version of the
Zacharias plan, students would agree to
pay the university 0.4 per cent of their
income for every thousand dollars of
tuition deferred, starting when they
leave Yale and continuing for a
maximum of thirty-five years.
Group Payment
Students who began making

payments during'the same year would
be considered a group. When a group
had paid off the total debt incurred by
all its members, all individuals in that
group would be relieved of making any
more payments to Yale.
The basis in economic theory of the
Zacharias plan, as adopted by Yale and
under consideration here, is an analogy
between the financing of education and
an investment in physical capital (such
as a building or equipment). Both raise
the productivity of an individual, and
as a result, an individual who makes
such an investment receives a higher
income.
Implementation of the Zacharias
plan has its risks. The administrative
costs might prove too high. Too few
students might be willing to enter into
the plan unless some provision existed
whereby they could "buy out" of the
plan. ("Buying out" would be
advantageous if one had an unusually
high income.) Alumni giving to the
University might plummet if graduates
were making tuition payments for
decades.
Social Inequity?
Especially sensitive aspects of the
Zacharias plan are its effects on blacks
and on women. It is expected that a
higher percentage of blacks than the
percentage of blacks in the professional
schools would probably choose to
finance their graduate education in this
way. Some critics argue against the plan
on the grounds of social equity since
whites expecting unusually high
incomes will not enter into the plan.
Those who formulated the plan for
Stanford recognized the difficulties
which would arise in the case of
women. In his study Human Capital,
Gary Becker says: "Absolute income
differentials are much smaller for
female than male college graduates, but
the rate of return may not be smaller
because direct costs are somewhat
lower and opportunity costs are much
lower for women. One reason why a
smaller money—not necessarily
real—rate of return would be expected
is the much lower labor force
participation of women. In fact, the
difference does not seem to
compensate fully for the difference in
returns. Both Mincer and Renshaw find
that the rate of return received by
white women college graduates is
several percentage points lower than
that 'received by white men."
What this means is that for women
as a whole, the costs of the investment
in education (tuition and books, plus
whatever income they would have
earned had they been working in the
labor force instead of going to school)
when subtracted Ironi the benefits
yields an amount that is less for women
than for men

The plan is intended to be
self-financing (though both Stanford
and Yale have appealed to foundations
for help in getting started). But a
college adopting the plan depends the
future income of its graduates. Since
women often earn less money income
than men and sometimes none ;»t all,
some provision had to be made to keep
the plan self-financing. In early versions
of Stanford's plan, a student would
agree to pay a given percentage of his
family income. Critics, however, have
argued that this solution burdens
women with a "negative dowry."
