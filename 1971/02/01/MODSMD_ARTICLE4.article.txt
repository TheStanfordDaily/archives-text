# Docking Problem Mars Successful Apollo Launch

### 
CAPE KENNEDY,FIa. (AP) — Three American astronauts
led by pioneer spaceman Alan B. Shepard Jr. rocketed
away from earth yesterday for another bold expedition to
the moon in search of lunar secrets in the rugged and
ancient Era Mauro Highlands.
But some three and one half hours into the flight,
trouble developed as the command ship attempted to link
up with the lunar lander. The latches failed to work
properly and the ships were unable to lock together.
Astronaut Stuart Roosa struggled with the problem at the
command ship controls while Apollo 14 commander
Shepard and lunar module pilot Edgar D. Mitchell watched
quietly.
The malfunction was finally corrected, and the two
crafts successfully docked, but whether they will attempt to
land on the moon is now in doubt. Flight control must be
sure that the docking procedure can be successfully
completed after the lunar craft has returned from the
moon's surface. They will make a decision on the mission
today.
The liftoff of Apollo 1 4 was entirely successful.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who addressed the
launch crew after the shot, called it an "incredibly
successful launch into orbit."
He said he was "tremendously moved by the
performance."
The spacemen set forth with the near disaster of Apollo
13 last April fresh in their memories. They know a lot is
riding on their mission, possibly the whole future of the
space program.
Their (ask is to complete the Apollo 13 mission, which
was cut short by the explosion of an oxygen tank when the
ship was 205,000 miles from earth and nearing the moon.
The Apollo 13 spacemen managed to return safely, but the
trouble grounded U.S. astronauts while experts pinpointed
the cause. Some $25 million was spent on new equipment
and changing the spaceship design, such as coating wiring in
stainless steel and adding an extra oxygen tank.
Cancellations
Apollo 13 contributed to the cancellation of two Apollo
moon-landing flights, and all three of the remaining
missions could be in danger if there is another failure.

To reach the moon the flight plan called for Apollo 14
to orbit earth 1 1/2 times in 2 1/2 hours so that the
spacemen could make certain all spaceship systems were
operating.
Then a second burst from Saturn s's third-stage engine
propels them toward their distant target, 228,899 miles
away.
For Shepard the space trip will be far different than the
one he took aboard the small, cramped Freedom 7
spacecraft in 1 961 to become America's first man in space.
That ride lasted 15 minutes, took him to an altitude of 11 6
miles and ended in the Atlantic 30 2 miles downrange from
Cape Kennedy.
Shepard and Mitchell hope to steer the lunar landing
ship they call Antares to a precise landing in a narrow
valley on the eastern shore of the Ocean of Storms. Roosa
will remain in orbit of the moon aboard the command ship
the spacemen named Kitty Hawk.
Battered, Hilly Region
Fra Mauro is a battered region of hills, ridges, deep
craters and boulders as big as automobiles. Scientists
believe the area harbors rocks dating back more than 4.6
billion years to the creation of the moon. Study of his
pristine material could tell much about the birth of the
moon, our earth and our solar system.
On the moon, Shepard and Mitchell plan two outside
excursions to deploy a nuclear powered science station and
to collect lunar material.
On launch the Saturn V had howled on its stand for 8 .9
seconds as a computer system made certain all five stage
engines generated full thrust. Four steel restraining arms
folded back and the monster rose majestically, spraying the
launch area with flame.
The 363 foot high rocket climbed slowly at first but
gradually gained speed, sending a thundering shock wave
rolling across Cape Kennedy.
Then, with its engines gulping fuel at a rate of 15 tons a
second, it arced out over the Atlantic Ocean and
disappeared in a layer of clouds at about 10,0 00 feet.
An estimated half a million visitors jammed vantage
points in the Cape Kennedy area to watch the fiery
departure of the great rocket.

CAPE KENNEDY,FIa. (AP) — Three American astronauts
led by pioneer spaceman Alan B. Shepard Jr. rocketed
away from earth yesterday for another bold expedition to
the moon in search of lunar secrets in the rugged and
ancient Era Mauro Highlands.
But some three and one half hours into the flight,
trouble developed as the command ship attempted to link
up with the lunar lander. The latches failed to work
properly and the ships were unable to lock together.
Astronaut Stuart Roosa struggled with the problem at the
command ship controls while Apollo 14 commander
Shepard and lunar module pilot Edgar D. Mitchell watched
quietly.
The malfunction was finally corrected, and the two
crafts successfully docked, but whether they will attempt to
land on the moon is now in doubt. Flight control must be
sure that the docking procedure can be successfully
completed after the lunar craft has returned from the
moon's surface. They will make a decision on the mission
today.
The liftoff of Apollo 1 4 was entirely successful.
Vice President Spiro T. Agnew, who addressed the
launch crew after the shot, called it an "incredibly
successful launch into orbit."
He said he was "tremendously moved by the
performance."
The spacemen set forth with the near disaster of Apollo
13 last April fresh in their memories. They know a lot is
riding on their mission, possibly the whole future of the
space program.
Their (ask is to complete the Apollo 13 mission, which
was cut short by the explosion of an oxygen tank when the
ship was 205,000 miles from earth and nearing the moon.
The Apollo 13 spacemen managed to return safely, but the
trouble grounded U.S. astronauts while experts pinpointed
the cause. Some $25 million was spent on new equipment
and changing the spaceship design, such as coating wiring in
stainless steel and adding an extra oxygen tank.
Cancellations
Apollo 13 contributed to the cancellation of two Apollo
moon-landing flights, and all three of the remaining
missions could be in danger if there is another failure.

To reach the moon the flight plan called for Apollo 14
to orbit earth 1 1/2 times in 2 1/2 hours so that the
spacemen could make certain all spaceship systems were
operating.
Then a second burst from Saturn s's third-stage engine
propels them toward their distant target, 228,899 miles
away.
For Shepard the space trip will be far different than the
one he took aboard the small, cramped Freedom 7
spacecraft in 1 961 to become America's first man in space.
That ride lasted 15 minutes, took him to an altitude of 11 6
miles and ended in the Atlantic 30 2 miles downrange from
Cape Kennedy.
Shepard and Mitchell hope to steer the lunar landing
ship they call Antares to a precise landing in a narrow
valley on the eastern shore of the Ocean of Storms. Roosa
will remain in orbit of the moon aboard the command ship
the spacemen named Kitty Hawk.
Battered, Hilly Region
Fra Mauro is a battered region of hills, ridges, deep
craters and boulders as big as automobiles. Scientists
believe the area harbors rocks dating back more than 4.6
billion years to the creation of the moon. Study of his
pristine material could tell much about the birth of the
moon, our earth and our solar system.
On the moon, Shepard and Mitchell plan two outside
excursions to deploy a nuclear powered science station and
to collect lunar material.
