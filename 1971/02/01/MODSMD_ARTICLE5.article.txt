The Stanford Judicial Council, dormant as a campus
issue for almost eighteen months, is once again in the
limelight. And once again the feasabiJity of a judicial body
whose jurisdiction is unclear, whose powers are not well
defined, and whose efforts are often ridiculed, must be
clearly examined.
Friday's hearing clearly exemplified the frailty of the
current body. Although he was admittedly under severe
strain at the time, SJC Chairman Howard Williams's
contempt citations, and the suspensions which President
Lyman subsequently imposed, are in no way fair.
Firstly, Williams, although he frequently made
reference to his absolute power to control the courtroom,
never fully explained courtroom procedure - when
objections may be raised, what sanctions the chairman
may impose and under what circumstances he may impose
them - to the defendants and their counsel.
Secondly, Williams has obviously decided that his
mandate to keep order in the courtroom implies the
power of summary contempt - but nowhere in the
Legislative and Judicial Charter is this specific power given
to the SJC's chairman. For the chairman recoinn .iiu
summary penalties for contempt when he is not
specifically empowered to do so by the Charter, seems
irresponsible in the extreme.

This is »iox to say, n%*ever. that the chairman should
not have summary cohtempt power The Committee of
Fifteen and ti<v jsiudetlt Cbnduct Legislative Council act
immediately to provide the ciiainnan with that specific
power
The C-l 5 and the SCLC should also address themselves
as soon as possible to solving the following questions:
-Over whom does the SJC have jurisdiction? If it is to
try only student cases, it is hardly appropriate to have
faculty members on the SJC. On the other hand, if it is to
have some jurisdiction over faculty, that jurisdiction
should be defined as soon as possible.
- Why is there no appellate body, other than a
sub-council of the SJC, to examine the findings of the
SJC?
-Although John Schwartz is occupying the role of
public prosecutor for the SJC, this position is not
provided for in the Charter. In addition, if there is to be
provision for a public prosecutor, it is only fair that a
provision for a public defender also be instituted.
Without the backbone of a strong Judicial system,
University self-governance is little more than an
unattainable ideal. The SJC, based as it is on a faulty and
incomplete charter, is an easy mark for those who wish to
discredit it.
