## SCLC Going Its Own Way 
### 
The SCLC has proved to be the less
controversial of the two bodies created
by the Legislative and Judicial Charter.
It consists of six faculty members
appointed by the Faculty Senate, three
students elected by proportional
representation by the student body, the
ASSU President, and the Speaker of the
Student Senate. The chairman is
appointed by the President of the
University from among the six faculty
representatives.
Because othe SCLC has plenary
power to enact legislation governing
student conduct and to repeal existing
legislation, including even the
Fundamental Standard and Honor
Code, it was originally felt that it
would be the center of much
controversy and might even be the
focal point of a student-faculty split.
This has never happened, however, as
campus interest has focused on the SJC
and the controversies associated with
individual cases. What has been at
question has not been the law but the
moral legitimacy of the acts of those
who have been hailed before the SJC,
and the tactics of defendants during
SJC proceedings.
But the SCLC has at times been the
object of great concern on the part of
those who have wanted the campus
judicial system to succeed. During its
first year of operation, 1968-69,
substantial differences divided its
members. One member was not in
principle sympathetic to the idea of a
campus judicial system, others wanted
to develop legislation to further protect
the rights of defendants before the SJC,
and still others wanted to greatly
strengthen the campus disruption
policy. In the spring, the SCLC was
caught up in the swirl of events and the
heightened tensions surrounding the

AEL sit-in and the occupation of
Encina Hall. Ultimately its members
became deadlocked (although not along
faculty-student lines) and the year
ended with no legislation enacted. Prior
legislation such as the Fundamental
Standard and the disruption policy
continued in force, however.
During its second year, with Yale
Braunstein, John Shoch, Harvey Hukari
and Roger Reed among its members,
the SCLC initially appeared to face yet
another year of deadlock. As the year
progressed, however, members with
widely differing political ideologies
were able to find areas of agreement,
trust developed, and the legislative mill
began to operate. A rule permitting the
creation of subordinate judicial
councils in certain of the professional
schools, mainly to hear honor code
cases, was enacted, as was a long and
detailed penalty code for use by the
SJC. During the spring crisis the SCLC
enacted an emergency rule authorizing
the President of the University to close
buildings during disruptions.
This year the proportional
representation system of electing three
of the student members yielded a group
with more centrist political leanings.
SCLC members have worked well
together and are approaching the "first
passage" stage of enacting legislation
prohibiting the possession of dangerous
weapons on campus and repealing some
of the ancient rules, once so jealously
guarded by the Trustees, prescribing
dress regulations, sign-out procedures,
and visiting hours for Stanford women.
Underway also is a study of the rules
governing student conduct at the
overseas campuses, a series of
discussions of the effectiveness of the
Fundamental Standard as a basic
statement governing student conduct,

and the possible need for specific
legislation to prohibit the ejection of
community members from open
meetings on campus.
But SCLC sessions draw little
attention from the student body;
although our meetings are open to
members of the community, over the
past two years we have had no more
than half a dozen visitors. Free of
community and constituency pressures,
the SCLC has been able to go its own
way while the SJC has been the center
of contention.
