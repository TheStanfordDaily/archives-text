# From The President

### 
The accumulation of stress in the campus community, sometimes
accompanied by outbreaks of lawlessness, has brought a growing
recognition that if the institution is to retain control of its affairs it must
develop a genuine capacity to govern itself. The capacity to make rules
that are widely accepted as legitimate, and the ability to deal with those
who transgress the rules in a fair and effective way, lie close to the heart of
self-government. Understanding of the system is, in turn essential to its
orderly operation and to the chance of improving it.
The (Stanford judicial system) is far from perfect. Most people who
have had occasion to look at it carefully agree that it is inadequate in
important respects, but there is little agreement on what its chief
inadequacies are and how best to correct them.
We will not be permitted the luxury of avoiding the problems of
self-government. They are ours, and if we do not meet them, we risk
having solutions imposed on us. The energy, intelligence, and
thoughtfulness that we bring to these questions will in no small measure
influence the future shape of the University.
