## Fundamental Standard Revisited 
### 
Sometime around the turn of the century,
Stanford's first president, David Starr Jordan, devised
a formula for student conduct called the
Fundamental Stanford. It reads: "Students are
expected to show both within and without the
University such respect for order, morality, personal
honor, and the rights of others as is demanded of
good citizens. Failure to do this will be sufficient
cause for removal from the University." According to
this masterpiece of ambiguity, a student may be
expelled from Stanford for offenses ranging from
murder to nose-picking.
Obviously, this compact package of moralisms can
no longer stand by itself as a guide to student
conduct, although it may have served reasonably well
in an age when everybody had a pretty good idea of
what exactly "order, morality, personal honor, and
the rights of others" were. It can be conceded, I
think, that the Fundamental Standard as such is no
longer useful without extensive interpretation by
representative groups of students, serving in both
legislative and judicial capacities.
Following roughly this reasoning, the Powers That
Be finally created two bodies composed of students
and faculty, the Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC), and the Stanford Judicial Council (SJC). The
purpose of these, presumably, was two-fold: 1) to
provide a means by which President Jordan's
all-encompassing Standard could be implemented
with a certain degree of reason, relevance, and

flexibility; and 2) to do so in such a way that
segments of the Stanford population other than the
administration could initiate this implementation.
So far, so good. This system of student discipline,
on paper, gives students a fairly good opportunity to
discipline themselves. It has broken down to a large
extent, however, not because it is structurally
unsound, but because the individuals required to
maintain the structure failed in their responsibilities.
This failure is attributable in equal share to students,
faculty, and administration.
Most of those students and faculty members who
have made up past and present SCLS's and SJC's
seem to share the delusion that the antedeluvian
Fundamental Standard is still the be-all and end-all of
student conduct. Thus, there has been a marked
unwillingness to progress beyond Jordan's Generality
and a corresponding unwillingness on the part of
students to accept as valid rulings that are based
solely on such a generality. The situation at present is
as if every local, state, and federal law were wiped off
the books and replaced with the injunction "Be
Good."
The administration, then, has taken up the slack
caused by the blindness of the students and faculty.
The university system of discipline now comes
perilously close to one-man rule, not because of a
nefarious conspiracy between Lyman and Schwartz
to institute a reign of fascism at Stanford, but
because no one else appears capable of dealing with
the very real potential of mob rule on this campus.

The administration has been justly criticized by
many, members of the SCLC and SJC among them,
for overstepping its prerogatives in cases of student
misconduct. But it has done so because the SCLC and
SJC have not taken the responsibility to define these
prerogatives, by establishing their own. The
administration has no choice but to prosecute
students under the Fundamental Standard because
there are almost no other clear, specific rules under
which to prosecute them.
The problem lies not in the judicial structure but
in the lack of initiative evidenced by those who are a
part of it. The SCLC should and can make legislation
that indicates what "order, morality, personal honor,
and the rights of others" are; the SJC could thereby
make a decision without the necessity of agonizing
over the meaning of the Fundamental Standard. If
this were to happen, the administration would not
and could not take such a large part in the
disciplining of students.
Students who are not on the SCLC or SJC must
find out who are on these bodies and pressure them
into taking such action as will render the
Fundamental Standard useful and relevant. If such
action is not taken, the breakdown of the judicial
system at Stanford will be completed. The
administration will have gained, by default, absolute
say over matters of student conduct, and students
will have no one to blame but themselves.
