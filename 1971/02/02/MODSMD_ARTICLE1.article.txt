# Sixty Seconds To Slavery
## 
### TOM GIVEN Commentary 
Accoiding to black workers at
Boston's Polaroid Corporation, it takes
their company only 60 seconds to
imprison a black man in South Africa.
In the time it takes to take a picture,
a black in South Africa can be
registered in the white man's world. A
picture, some stamps, and his pass is
complete. It is his passport to the world
of white South Africa. His employer
must sign it every month; he must carry
it on his person at all times. He loses his
name, and becomes a number.
As a number, he loses his humanity,
and most of his human rights. His life is
subject to the whims of government
officials. The man at the labor bureau
gives him his job. The man at the Bantu
Commissioner's Office gives him his
permit to live in a "white" area. The
man in the police uniform watches
night and day to keep him in line.
Restricted Life
The simplest of human activities are
governed by racial considerations.
Buses, trains, drinking fountains and
even park benches are marked for
either "Europeans Only" or "Non
Europeans Only." Entrances and
counters in post offices, airline
terminals, and shops are also separate
and unequal.
Choices of home, job, wife-mate and
bedmate are governed by both custom
and law. All hinges on racial
classification.

It's a long way from Mississippi, to
be sure. Jim Crow looks quite crude
next to the South African apartheid, or
"apartness," and the informal American
racism appears quite another thing
from the deliberate South African
product.
The public accomodations of the
land are strictly and thoroughly
segregated. Most jobs are affected by a
legal color bar. Intercourse - as well as
marriage • between whites and
nonwhites is strictly prohibited under
the Prohibition of Mixed Marriages and
Immorality Acts.
Temporary Residency
Indeed, under the current fiction of
"separate development," blacks and
whites do not even share "homelands."
Current government policy holds that
blacks are transient residents in the
"white" sectors of the country; their
legal homes are in the Bantustans or
reserves "black areas" that comprise
13% of the South African land area.
Only a third of the African
population actually lives in these
"homelands"; the other two-thirds are
evenly divided between the "white"
farms and urban areas.
The reserves are badly eroded and
unable to feed their population;
nonetheless, government policy is to
force more and more Africans into
them - allowing them to leave for the
white world only when the white world
needs their labor.

Thus, a man may be separated from
his family, while he works in the mines,
factories, or offices ot Johannesburg,
Capetown, or Durban. He will live in a
hostel or a compound, with other men
cut off from their families in the
homelands. His wife may visit him, but
only for 7 2 hours. A longer stay
requires a permit - a permit that is
increasingly hard to come by.
The breadwinner's presence in the
white area is equally subject to
regulation. His employer must sign his
pass every month. If he loses his job, he
may be deported to his legal homeland
- a homeland he and his family may
never have seen. Failure to carry his
pass carries its own retribution.
Hundreds of thousands of blacks are
arrested every year for such an
oversight.
Polaroid's Involvement
Just where did Polaroid fit into the
South African scheme? Polaroid
products could have aided the law
enforcement efforts of the regime, of
course; such sales have been ended. The
broader question of American
involvement in the South African way
of life remains.
A biracial committee sent by
Polaroid to investigate the
corporation's role in apartheid
recommended that it continue to
operate its South African subsidiary.
The profits on the operations will be
donated to anti-apartheid movements.
Yet, Polaroid is but a drop in the South
African bucket. Many American

companies, attracted by high returns on
investment capital, have settled in the
country. A glance at a stockholder's
report for a company such as General
Motors or Ford will reveal the extent of
its investments in apartheid. Only
Britain has more a larger share in the
South African economy.
America's Role
The Anglo-American corporation
boasts that "many countries have
smaller budgets than Anglo American."
Mobil Oil Southern Africa Ltd.
operates a refinery and markets
products throughout the republic.
Sperry Rand offers computers from its
Johannesburg office, competing with
firms such as IBM and Burroughs.
Colgate-Palmolive, and Gillette, General
Electric and Standard Oil of New
Jersey are but a few of the American
businesses evident in the land.
The role of this investment in the
maintenance of apartheid is unclear.
Certainly, it has contributed to the
already awesome strength of the South
African economy. Whether a judicious
use of the economic power could foster
either an easing or an end of the system
is even less clear, and less plausible.
Military Support
White South Africa is heavily
committeed to its peculiar institutions,
and has built a machinery for their
defenfe. The South African military,
supplied with home-made and foreign
weaponry, is Africa's most formidable
