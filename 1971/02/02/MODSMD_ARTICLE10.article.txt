# Pacific Film Archive Open
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
As it is, the Bay Area is foremost in
America and second only to Paris as a gold
mine of film revivals and retrospective series.
Making the choice of what films to see even
more difficult is the opening of the Pacific
Film Archive at the new University Art
Museum in Berkeley (on Durant one block east
of Telegraph). Though the museum has been
offering impressive programs over the past
three years (including Jean-Luc Godard's
celebrated visit in 1 968 ), last week marked the
beginning of the Archive's operations on a
full-time basis.
The director of the Archive is Sheldon
Renan, until now known as the author of An
Introduction to the American Underground
Film. Renan acknowledges his debt to Henri
Langlois and the Cinematheque Francaise in
regard to the structuring of Archive activities.
A Film a Day
At the start, a different film will be
screened twice each day at the student charge
of 5 0 cents. Lectures, panel discussions and
special screenings are also frequent, though
they are not scheduled on a regular basis.

To compliment the programs in the main
200-seat theatre, the Archive also has one
12 -seat screening room and four 3-seat cubicles
for individual request showings. This feature
may or may not turn out to be the treasure
chest it sounds like, as its success depends both
on Renan's receptivity to requests and on the
extent of viewers' abuse of their privileges.
At the moment, the Archive's own library
consists of 600 titles (including 2 00 Japanese
pictures recently acquired from Toho Films),
but as the Archive's activities as a center for
film preservation and restoration increase, the
library's holdings should grow substantially.
Inaugural Program
The Archive's inaugural program is entitled
"Fifty Years of Swedish Cinema," extending
from the pioneer work of Mauritz Stiller and
Victor Sjostrom to the most recent films of Bo
Widerberg and Ingmar Bergman.
February 2 3 marks the beginning of French
Film Week, during which a number of
prominant members of the French film scene
have promised to attend in conjunction with
the showing of several new films.
On paper (where it's been for the past four

years), the Archive looks tremendously
exciting. Kenan has used money that might
have gone for publicity in order to buy 35 mm
equipment and special projectors for the
screening rooms which send the celluloid
through the gate on air cushions rather than on
more ruinous sprockets.
Hopefully, the Archive will establish its
identity and reputation very quickly, so that
no one will ever have to refer to it derisively as
the Cinematheque Californian.
Warner Bros. Festival
Another outstanding addition to the
cinematic landscape is the Warner Brothers
festival at the Surf Interplayers. Many of the
pictures have recently been shown here by
Clive Miller but, on the other hand, many of
them haven't.
The imminent horror triple bill of "The
Mummy," "The Black Cat" and"The Golem"
is rather amazing and among the best films
being shown in February and March (the series
continues until the end of April) are Lang's
"Destiny," "The Adventures of Robin Hood,"
"Footlight Parade," Hawkes' "Air Force" and
"Torrid Zone," which stars Cagney at his very,
very best.

BLACK LEGACY DANCERS—A troupe of Stanford students rehearse their program of Afro-American
dance based on African rythms. "An Ancient Love" will premiere Thursday, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m. in the

Warner Bros. Festival
Another outstanding addition to the
cinematic landscape is the Warner Brothers
festival at the Surf Interplayers. Many of the
pictures have recently been shown here by
Clive Miller but, on the other hand, many of
them haven't.
The imminent horror triple bill of "The
Mummy," "The Black Cat" and"The Golem"
is rather amazing and among the best films
being shown in February and March (the series
continues until the end of April) are Lang's
"Destiny," "The Adventures of Robin Hood,"
"Footlight Parade," Hawkes' "Air Force" and
"Torrid Zone," which stars Cagney at his very,
very best.

BLACK LEGACY DANCERS—A troupe of Stanford students rehearse their program of Afro-American
dance based on African rythms. "An Ancient Love" will premiere Thursday, Feb. 4 at 8 p.m. in the
Women's Gym and continue through this weekend and next. The picture which ran in Friday's DAILY
was of the Ishangi dancers, who will not be on the program.
As it is, the Bay Area is foremost in
America and second only to Paris as a gold
mine of film revivals and retrospective series.
Making the choice of what films to see even
more difficult is the opening of the Pacific
Film Archive at the new University Art
Museum in Berkeley (on Durant one block east
of Telegraph). Though the museum has been
offering impressive programs over the past
three years (including Jean-Luc Godard's
celebrated visit in 1 968 ), last week marked the
beginning of the Archive's operations on a
full-time basis.
The director of the Archive is Sheldon
Renan, until now known as the author of An
Introduction to the American Underground
Film. Renan acknowledges his debt to Henri
Langlois and the Cinematheque Francaise in
regard to the structuring of Archive activities.
A Film a Day
At the start, a different film will be
screened twice each day at the student charge
of 5 0 cents. Lectures, panel discussions and
special screenings are also frequent, though
they are not scheduled on a regular basis.

To compliment the programs in the main
200-seat theatre, the Archive also has one
12 -seat screening room and four 3-seat cubicles
for individual request showings. This feature
may or may not turn out to be the treasure
chest it sounds like, as its success depends both
on Renan's receptivity to requests and on the
extent of viewers' abuse of their privileges.
At the moment, the Archive's own library
consists of 600 titles (including 2 00 Japanese
pictures recently acquired from Toho Films),
but as the Archive's activities as a center for
film preservation and restoration increase, the
library's holdings should grow substantially.
Inaugural Program
The Archive's inaugural program is entitled
"Fifty Years of Swedish Cinema," extending
from the pioneer work of Mauritz Stiller and
Victor Sjostrom to the most recent films of Bo
Widerberg and Ingmar Bergman.
February 2 3 marks the beginning of French
Film Week, during which a number of
prominant members of the French film scene
have promised to attend in conjunction with
the showing of several new films.
On paper (where it's been for the past four

years), the Archive looks tremendously
exciting. Kenan has used money that might
have gone for publicity in order to buy 35 mm
equipment and special projectors for the
screening rooms which send the celluloid
through the gate on air cushions rather than on
more ruinous sprockets.
Hopefully, the Archive will establish its
identity and reputation very quickly, so that
no one will ever have to refer to it derisively as
the Cinematheque Californian.
