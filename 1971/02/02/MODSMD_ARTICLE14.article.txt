6 Agitators 9 Blamed
LOS ANGELES — A federal marshal blamed "agitators"
yesterday for the rioting that followed a peaceful
Mexican-American antiwar demonstration that left a man
dead and more than 10 injured. A Chicanospokesman
disagreed.
Marshal Gaylord Campbell, who had assigned deputy
marshals as observers of Sunday's rally, told newsmen the
violence appeared to be "a planned operation" that was
"definitely started by agitators.
"We observed the rioters start this thing," he said.
"Sheriff's deputies were bending over backwards to avoid
a confrontation . . . the deputies showed unusual restraint
even in protecting themselves."
But Rosalio Munoz, head of the Chicano Moratorium
Committee, which sponsored the rally, said the violence
was spontaneous, perhaps set off "by the sheriff's firing
squad tactics." He said deputies fired without first trying
to break up demonstrators with tear gas.
Sheriff's spokesmen said a screaming mob of youths
ran from the site of the rally of 5,000 to Whittier
Boulevard, the main street of the nation's largest
Mexican-American community. Vastly outnumbered,
deputies facing the mob fired shotguns in self defense, the
spokesmen said. Nine persons were hit, one fatally.
Ecuador Ousts U.S.
WASHINGTON — Ecuador demanded Monday night the
withdrawal from its territory of the United States military
mission.
In a note signed by Ecuadorian foreign minister Jose
Maria Ponce Yepez, Ecuador said the action was taken in
retaliation for what it termed "coercive measures"
adopted by the United States two weeks ago in the fishing
rights conflict.
On Jan. 18, the United States announced suspension of
military sales to Ecuador and threatened to suspend
economic aid following a series of seizures of American
fishing vessels.

The Ecuadorian action came one day after a special
meeting of OAS foreign ministers passed a resolution
calling on the U.S. and Ecuador to work out their
differences in the fishing rights dispute through
negotiations.
Merritt Students Take Building
OAKLAND — A racially mixed group of about 2 0
students occupied the administration offices at Merritt
College Monday to enforce demands for a
community-controlled minority college, officials said.
A few pickets carried signs urging a student strike, but
a college spokesman said classes at the 8,5 00 student
junior college continued.
Chancellor John W. Dunn of the Peralta Junior College
District said the students demands would be presented to
the district board Monday night. Dunn visited the campus
himself briefly.
Douglas Miranda, a Black Students Union leader, told a
campus rally the student action was touched off by failure
of the board to meet on the subject last week as
scheduled.
Egyptian Planes Cross Canal
Egyptian warplanes flew over Israeli positions along the
Suez Canal twice Monday just four days before the
six-month cease-fire was due to expire.
It was the second overflight charge leveled against
Egypt in 72 hours and the seventh time Israel has
complained of such acts since the ceasefire went into
effect last August.
A military spokesman in Tel Aviv claimed that Soviet
made MIG2Is of Egypt's air force made the flights, but he
did not say how many were involved or where they
intruded. Nor did he say whether any shots were
exchanged.
Israel lodged a complaint with the U.N. Truce
Supervision Organization.

6 Agitators 9 Blamed
LOS ANGELES — A federal marshal blamed "agitators"
yesterday for the rioting that followed a peaceful
Mexican-American antiwar demonstration that left a man
dead and more than 10 injured. A Chicanospokesman
disagreed.
Marshal Gaylord Campbell, who had assigned deputy
marshals as observers of Sunday's rally, told newsmen the
violence appeared to be "a planned operation" that was
"definitely started by agitators.
"We observed the rioters start this thing," he said.
"Sheriff's deputies were bending over backwards to avoid
a confrontation . . . the deputies showed unusual restraint
even in protecting themselves."
But Rosalio Munoz, head of the Chicano Moratorium
Committee, which sponsored the rally, said the violence
was spontaneous, perhaps set off "by the sheriff's firing
squad tactics." He said deputies fired without first trying
to break up demonstrators with tear gas.
Sheriff's spokesmen said a screaming mob of youths
ran from the site of the rally of 5,000 to Whittier
Boulevard, the main street of the nation's largest
Mexican-American community. Vastly outnumbered,
deputies facing the mob fired shotguns in self defense, the
spokesmen said. Nine persons were hit, one fatally.
Ecuador Ousts U.S.
WASHINGTON — Ecuador demanded Monday night the
withdrawal from its territory of the United States military
mission.
In a note signed by Ecuadorian foreign minister Jose
Maria Ponce Yepez, Ecuador said the action was taken in
retaliation for what it termed "coercive measures"
adopted by the United States two weeks ago in the fishing
rights conflict.
On Jan. 18, the United States announced suspension of
military sales to Ecuador and threatened to suspend
economic aid following a series of seizures of American
fishing vessels.

The Ecuadorian action came one day after a special
meeting of OAS foreign ministers passed a resolution
calling on the U.S. and Ecuador to work out their
differences in the fishing rights dispute through
negotiations.
Merritt Students Take Building
OAKLAND — A racially mixed group of about 2 0
students occupied the administration offices at Merritt
College Monday to enforce demands for a
community-controlled minority college, officials said.
A few pickets carried signs urging a student strike, but
a college spokesman said classes at the 8,5 00 student
junior college continued.
Chancellor John W. Dunn of the Peralta Junior College
District said the students demands would be presented to
the district board Monday night. Dunn visited the campus
himself briefly.
Douglas Miranda, a Black Students Union leader, told a
campus rally the student action was touched off by failure
of the board to meet on the subject last week as
scheduled.
Egyptian Planes Cross Canal
Egyptian warplanes flew over Israeli positions along the
Suez Canal twice Monday just four days before the
six-month cease-fire was due to expire.
It was the second overflight charge leveled against
Egypt in 72 hours and the seventh time Israel has
complained of such acts since the ceasefire went into
effect last August.
A military spokesman in Tel Aviv claimed that Soviet
made MIG2Is of Egypt's air force made the flights, but he
did not say how many were involved or where they
intruded. Nor did he say whether any shots were
exchanged.
Israel lodged a complaint with the U.N. Truce
