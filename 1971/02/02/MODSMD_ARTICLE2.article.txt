# Scientists Here Primed For Apollo

### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Next Friday afternoon if all goes
well, while astronauts Alan B. Shepard
Jr. and Edgar D. Mitchell catch some
sleep in their lunar module Antares, the
third astronaut Stuart A. Roosa will
flip a switch in the orbiting command
module, sending a radio beam bouncing
off the moon's surface to Stanford's
150-foot dish. The result will be a
description of the composition of the
moon's crust to a depth of several
meters, deeper than that seen by
photographs or explored by astronauts.
The NASA -funded experiment is
part of a continuing program in bistatic
radar exploration of the moon being
carried out by scientists at the Stanford
Center for Radar Astronomy, part of
the Radioscience Division of the
Department of Electrical Engineering.
(Another Stanford experiment, a
mortar-firing lunar seismometer, will
also be on board Apollo XIV.
However, the principal investigator for
that experiment, Dr. Robert L. Kovach
of the Geology Department, left for
Houston last week and was not
available to describe his work to the
Daily.)

Senior Research Associate H. Taylor
Howard, who is the principal
investigator for the Apollo XIV radar
experiment, sees it as a major step
forward in the use of radar for
planetary exploration. Although the
technique has been tested on previous
space probes such as Lunar Orbiter I
and 111, and Explorer 35, this will be

the first time that two signals have been
broadcast simultaneously. Apollo XIV
also offers the opportunity to calibrate
the radar data by comparison with
optical photography.
Both Mr. Howard and his associate,
Research Engineer G. Leonard Tyler,
envision the use of bistatic radar to
explore other planets, most of which
have an environment that is not
conducive to manned exploration. For
example, it may well be that man will
never see the surface of Venus due to
its heavy cloud cover and dense
atmosphere. Our only picture of the
surface will be*one produced by radar
techniques—techniques similar to those
used and proved in the Apollo XIV
experiment.
Bistatic radar is merely radar in
which the transmitter and receiver are
located in different places; in this case,
the transmitter is on board the Apollo
spacecraft, while the receiver is on the
earth. The advantage of using bistatic
radar, instead of conventional
monostotic radar, is that the specular
point (the point at the center of the
area seen by the receiver) moves along
with the spacecraft in bistatic radar,
thus giving a radar portrait of a swath
of lunar surface.
Reflecting Radar
The situation is roughly analogous
to a person looking in a mirror. If the
person is both the "transmitter" and
"receiver" of the light waves striking
the mirror, he sees an image of himself
only at one point on the mirror—that
directly opposite him. If the

"transmitter" is another person in the
room, and the other person is walking
across the room, his reflection will
appear at different places on the
mirror's surface.
The analogy becomes more exact if
the mirror is spherical and has a rough
and pitted face. Then, by watching how
the reflection changes as the other
person walks around the mirror one can
infer various things about the nature of
the mirror's surface, such as its
roughness. Given sophisticated optical
instruments one could determine many
more subtle characteristics.
Stanford's Part
Although the analogy is imperfect,
this is basicly what the bistatic radar
experiment will attempt to do with
radio waves on the moon. The
spacecraft will transmit radio waves at
two frequencies (260 MHz and 2200
MHz, where "MHz" is the abbreviation
for MegaHertz,or 1,000,000 cycles per
second).
The lower frequency signal will be
received by the Stanford Center for
Radar Astronomy's 150-foot dish on
the hill behind the campus and the
other signal by the NASA Deep Space
Network's 210-foot dish in Goldstone,
California.
Changed Reflections
The signals sent out by Apollo will
be modified in several ways by the
moon's surface. First, since the moon is
an imperfect reflector, less than ten
percent of the signal's energy is
bounced toward earth. The strength of

the received signal is used to infer
composition of the lunar crust. The
two different frequencies will penetrate
the crust to different depths, thus
giving some clues as to vertical
structure. For instance, the higher
frequency penetrates only a meter or
so, while the lower may probe tens of
meters below the surface.
Second, the received signal will be
made up of the original frequencies
plus many other frequencies that arise
when the original signal reflect off of
individual rough features, such as rocks
and crater walls. The overall frequency
distribution gives information about
the general lunar surface shape in the
region of reflection, while the number
and strength of individual frequency
components are a measure of
small-scale roughness.
Finally, there is a point in the lunar
orbit where the reflected signal
becomes weaker and finally disappears.
This is the point known as the Brewster
Angle, in which the polarization of the
signal reverses. This behavior
constitutes a direct measurement of the
dielectric (i.e. conducting) properties of
the lunar material, and allows scientists
to deduce both the composition and
the packing density of the lunar
material.

The Apollo 14 astronauts flashed
past the halfway point Monday of their
quarter-million-mile voyage to the
moon, with doubts dispelled that a
pesky docking apparatus would block
their lunar landing.
The spacemen, Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
Kdgar D. Mitchell and Stuart A. Roosa,
awoke from a day-long sleep only a few
hours after officials announced that a
spacecraft docking problem had
apparently cleared itself.
Mission Control engineers said the
problem with a docking mechanism
that failed to work properly Sunday
had apparently worked itself out and
space officials gave a go-ahead for
Shepard and Mitchell to guide the
Apollo 1 4 lunar module down into the
forbidding Fra Mauro lunar highlands
Friday.
Apollo 14 sped past the half-way
point at 7 :08 p.m. EST. The spacecraft
was then 125,350 miles from both the
earth and the moon, and was flying
through space at about 3,200 miles per
hour.

Senior Research Associate H. Taylor
Howard, who is the principal
investigator for the Apollo XIV radar
experiment, sees it as a major step
forward in the use of radar for
planetary exploration. Although the
technique has been tested on previous
space probes such as Lunar Orbiter I
and 111, and Explorer 35, this will be

the first time that two signals have been
broadcast simultaneously. Apollo XIV
also offers the opportunity to calibrate
the radar data by comparison with
optical photography.
Both Mr. Howard and his associate,
Research Engineer G. Leonard Tyler,
envision the use of bistatic radar to
explore other planets, most of which
have an environment that is not
conducive to manned exploration. For
example, it may well be that man will
never see the surface of Venus due to
its heavy cloud cover and dense
atmosphere. Our only picture of the
surface will be*one produced by radar
techniques—techniques similar to those
used and proved in the Apollo XIV
experiment.
Bistatic radar is merely radar in
which the transmitter and receiver are
located in different places; in this case,
the transmitter is on board the Apollo
spacecraft, while the receiver is on the
earth. The advantage of using bistatic
radar, instead of conventional
monostotic radar, is that the specular
point (the point at the center of the
area seen by the receiver) moves along
with the spacecraft in bistatic radar,
thus giving a radar portrait of a swath
of lunar surface.
Reflecting Radar
The situation is roughly analogous
to a person looking in a mirror. If the
person is both the "transmitter" and
"receiver" of the light waves striking
the mirror, he sees an image of himself
only at one point on the mirror—that
directly opposite him. If the

"transmitter" is another person in the
room, and the other person is walking
across the room, his reflection will
appear at different places on the
mirror's surface.
The analogy becomes more exact if
the mirror is spherical and has a rough
and pitted face. Then, by watching how
the reflection changes as the other
person walks around the mirror one can
infer various things about the nature of
the mirror's surface, such as its
roughness. Given sophisticated optical
instruments one could determine many
more subtle characteristics.
Stanford's Part
Although the analogy is imperfect,
this is basicly what the bistatic radar
experiment will attempt to do with
radio waves on the moon. The
spacecraft will transmit radio waves at
two frequencies (260 MHz and 2200
MHz, where "MHz" is the abbreviation
for MegaHertz,or 1,000,000 cycles per
second).
The lower frequency signal will be
received by the Stanford Center for
Radar Astronomy's 150-foot dish on
the hill behind the campus and the
other signal by the NASA Deep Space
Network's 210-foot dish in Goldstone,
California.
Changed Reflections
The signals sent out by Apollo will
be modified in several ways by the
moon's surface. First, since the moon is
an imperfect reflector, less than ten
percent of the signal's energy is
bounced toward earth. The strength of

the received signal is used to infer
composition of the lunar crust. The
two different frequencies will penetrate
the crust to different depths, thus
giving some clues as to vertical
structure. For instance, the higher
frequency penetrates only a meter or
so, while the lower may probe tens of
meters below the surface.
Second, the received signal will be
made up of the original frequencies
plus many other frequencies that arise
when the original signal reflect off of
individual rough features, such as rocks
and crater walls. The overall frequency
distribution gives information about
the general lunar surface shape in the
region of reflection, while the number
and strength of individual frequency
components are a measure of
small-scale roughness.
Finally, there is a point in the lunar
orbit where the reflected signal
becomes weaker and finally disappears.
This is the point known as the Brewster
Angle, in which the polarization of the
signal reverses. This behavior
constitutes a direct measurement of the
dielectric (i.e. conducting) properties of
the lunar material, and allows scientists
to deduce both the composition and
the packing density of the lunar
material.

Senior Research Associate H. Taylor
Howard, who is the principal
investigator for the Apollo XIV radar
experiment, sees it as a major step
forward in the use of radar for
planetary exploration. Although the
technique has been tested on previous
space probes such as Lunar Orbiter I
and 111, and Explorer 35, this will be

the first time that two signals have been
broadcast simultaneously. Apollo XIV
also offers the opportunity to calibrate
the radar data by comparison with
optical photography.
Both Mr. Howard and his associate,
Research Engineer G. Leonard Tyler,
envision the use of bistatic radar to
explore other planets, most of which
have an environment that is not
conducive to manned exploration. For
example, it may well be that man will
never see the surface of Venus due to
its heavy cloud cover and dense
atmosphere. Our only picture of the
surface will be*one produced by radar
techniques—techniques similar to those
used and proved in the Apollo XIV
experiment.
Bistatic radar is merely radar in
which the transmitter and receiver are
located in different places; in this case,
the transmitter is on board the Apollo
spacecraft, while the receiver is on the
earth. The advantage of using bistatic
radar, instead of conventional
monostotic radar, is that the specular
point (the point at the center of the
area seen by the receiver) moves along
with the spacecraft in bistatic radar,
thus giving a radar portrait of a swath
of lunar surface.
Reflecting Radar
The situation is roughly analogous
to a person looking in a mirror. If the
person is both the "transmitter" and
"receiver" of the light waves striking
the mirror, he sees an image of himself
only at one point on the mirror—that
directly opposite him. If the

"transmitter" is another person in the
room, and the other person is walking
across the room, his reflection will
appear at different places on the
mirror's surface.
The analogy becomes more exact if
the mirror is spherical and has a rough
and pitted face. Then, by watching how
the reflection changes as the other
person walks around the mirror one can
infer various things about the nature of
the mirror's surface, such as its
roughness. Given sophisticated optical
instruments one could determine many
more subtle characteristics.
Stanford's Part
Although the analogy is imperfect,
this is basicly what the bistatic radar
experiment will attempt to do with
radio waves on the moon. The
spacecraft will transmit radio waves at
two frequencies (260 MHz and 2200
MHz, where "MHz" is the abbreviation
for MegaHertz,or 1,000,000 cycles per
second).
The lower frequency signal will be
received by the Stanford Center for
Radar Astronomy's 150-foot dish on
the hill behind the campus and the
other signal by the NASA Deep Space
Network's 210-foot dish in Goldstone,
California.
Changed Reflections
The signals sent out by Apollo will
be modified in several ways by the
moon's surface. First, since the moon is
an imperfect reflector, less than ten
percent of the signal's energy is
bounced toward earth. The strength of

the received signal is used to infer
composition of the lunar crust. The
two different frequencies will penetrate
the crust to different depths, thus
giving some clues as to vertical
structure. For instance, the higher
frequency penetrates only a meter or
so, while the lower may probe tens of
meters below the surface.
Second, the received signal will be
made up of the original frequencies
plus many other frequencies that arise
when the original signal reflect off of
individual rough features, such as rocks
and crater walls. The overall frequency
distribution gives information about
the general lunar surface shape in the
region of reflection, while the number
and strength of individual frequency
components are a measure of
small-scale roughness.
Finally, there is a point in the lunar
orbit where the reflected signal
becomes weaker and finally disappears.
This is the point known as the Brewster
Angle, in which the polarization of the
signal reverses. This behavior
constitutes a direct measurement of the
dielectric (i.e. conducting) properties of
the lunar material, and allows scientists
to deduce both the composition and
the packing density of the lunar
material.

The Apollo 14 astronauts flashed
past the halfway point Monday of their
quarter-million-mile voyage to the
moon, with doubts dispelled that a
pesky docking apparatus would block
their lunar landing.
The spacemen, Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
Kdgar D. Mitchell and Stuart A. Roosa,
awoke from a day-long sleep only a few
hours after officials announced that a
spacecraft docking problem had
apparently cleared itself.
Mission Control engineers said the
problem with a docking mechanism
that failed to work properly Sunday
had apparently worked itself out and
space officials gave a go-ahead for
Shepard and Mitchell to guide the
Apollo 1 4 lunar module down into the
forbidding Fra Mauro lunar highlands
Friday.
Apollo 14 sped past the half-way
point at 7 :08 p.m. EST. The spacecraft
was then 125,350 miles from both the
earth and the moon, and was flying
through space at about 3,200 miles per
hour.
Next Friday afternoon if all goes
well, while astronauts Alan B. Shepard
Jr. and Edgar D. Mitchell catch some
sleep in their lunar module Antares, the
third astronaut Stuart A. Roosa will
flip a switch in the orbiting command
module, sending a radio beam bouncing
off the moon's surface to Stanford's
150-foot dish. The result will be a
description of the composition of the
moon's crust to a depth of several
meters, deeper than that seen by
photographs or explored by astronauts.
The NASA -funded experiment is
part of a continuing program in bistatic
radar exploration of the moon being
carried out by scientists at the Stanford
Center for Radar Astronomy, part of
the Radioscience Division of the
Department of Electrical Engineering.
