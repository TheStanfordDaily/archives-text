build-ups of troops are now underway.
From Moscow, Soviet Premier
Aleksei Kosygin stated the invasion of

make clear whether U.S. or South
Vietnamese troops were involved.
The North Vietnamese accused the
United States of sending thousands of
U.S. and South Vietnamese troops to
areas along the Laos-Vietnam border in
advance of "a new step of war
escalation in Laos." Hanoi's official
news agency also quoted the
Communist-led Pathet Lao as saying
the United States has sent "more
commando and scout groups deeper"
into southern I^aos.
Laotian army sources also reported a
build-up of North Vietnamese and
Pathet I*ao forces yesterday for
possible attacks on important areas of
northern and southern Laos.
U.S. bombers have been carrying out
daily air attacks on the Ho Chi Minh
trail in southern Laos in an effort to
knock out a dry season resupply of
enemy forces.
The Laotian reports came from the
Defense Ministry in Vientiane and from
a general who said that if the enemy
attacks succeed. neutralist
premier. Prince Souvanna Phouma, \vill

be overthrown despite U.S. support for
him.
The general declined the use of his
name, a Vientiane dispatch said.
Military leaders would take over in
Laos and continue fighting the
Communist-led forces, the general
asserted.
The Defense Ministry in Vientiane
said the North Vietnamese are building
up for offensive drives in both northern
and southern Laos.
The chief ministry spokesman, Gen.
Thong Phanh Knoksy, said two
regiments of the North Vietnamese
312 th Division have returned to
northern Laos after a six-month
absence and are apparently preparing
for an attack on Long Cheng, a U.S.
Central Intelligence Agency installation
southwest of the Plain of Jars.
Other military sources said the
enemy may be preparing attacks on the
Bolovens Plateau in southern l,aos.
In Washington, a Defense
Department spokesman reported a
major movement of North Vietnamese
troops down the Ho Chi Minh trail to
Laos in recent weeks. Other Pentagon
sources described the units as logistic
troops and raid they usually precede a
buildup in preparation for combat
operations.
With the reported enemy
infiltration, the Pentagon has now

revised its estimate of enemy troops in
Laos to 65,000 or 7 0,000.
The Defense Department
spokesman, Jerry W. Friedheim,
refused to comment on what steps the
allies might take to counter the
buildup.
The North Vietnamese delegation in
Paris accused the United States of
stepping up the war in Laos and said
this created new obstacles to the
Vietnam peace talks, now stalemated
there.

SAIGON (AP) — Neutralist Laos is
threatened today by possible invasions
from both Communist and allied
forces. Both sides claimed massive
build-ups of troops are now underway.
From Moscow, Soviet Premier
Aleksei Kosygin stated the invasion of
Laos is already underway. He did not
make clear whether U.S. or South
Vietnamese troops were involved.
The North Vietnamese accused the
United States of sending thousands of
U.S. and South Vietnamese troops to
areas along the Laos-Vietnam border in
advance of "a new step of war
escalation in Laos." Hanoi's official
news agency also quoted the
Communist-led Pathet Lao as saying
the United States has sent "more
commando and scout groups deeper"
into southern I^aos.
