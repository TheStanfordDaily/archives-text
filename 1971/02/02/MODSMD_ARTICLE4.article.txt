# Today In The 'Daily'
## 
### 
Today, of all days, is the day that Americans wait avidly for
all year. It's the annual time of that great fertility rite, Ground
Hog Day.
Across the country today, many primitive groundhog
watching societies will stand over the homes of thnir
neighborhood groundhogs to watch them emerge and perform
their orgiastic shadow-watching dance.
If your local groundhog loses his shadow, call our editorial
offices at x 4632, and maybe we can locate it.
Should he want to sell it, call our capitalist running dog
business office, at 328 4150.
All past, present and prospective staffers are invited to the
first free lunch of the month, today at noon in the office.
