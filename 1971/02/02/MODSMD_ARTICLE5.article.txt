# University To Study Voucher Finance Plan
## 
### BOB DRAZOVICH 
The Ford Foundation recently
announced that it has given Stanford a
$40,700 grant for a study of the
"voucher" system of educational
financing.
Under the voucher proposal, the
federal government instead of giving
tax money directly to a school system,
would give funds in the form of a
voucher to parents of all children.
These vouchers would pay a student's
expenses at any school of the parents'
choice.
The intent is for the school system
to become competitive, with each
public school, and certain
government-regulated private schools
competing for students by offering
better teachers, a more diverse
curriculum, and a hotter educational
system overall.
The research here will be directed by
Professor Henry Levin, an economist
who has done extensive work on
various aspects of educational
financing. It is the biggest revolution in
American education's history.
The voucher system of education
was first seriously proposed a few years
ago by economist Milton Friedman of
Chicago. He felt that if private
corporations were to take over the
education system, they would be
looking for maximized profit, which
would involve getting more students by
means of changes and innovations in
the classroom. In theory, classes would
lie smaller, new instructional aids

added, and administration made more
efficient.
The voucher system would also
improve the quality of teachers,
according to Friedman. Teacher's
tenure yould no longer be in effect.
More competitive wages would be paid,
and mediocrity would be phased out as
schools began to hire teachers on the
basis of their schooling, ability to
teach, and imagination.
The Ford Foundation maintains that
there has been little analytical
investigation of the economics of
voucher proposals. Professor Levin will
study the possible economic and fiscal
effects of "vouchers" on the schools
and students.
Additional Programs
The research, concerned with
education in grades kindergarten
through twelve, will also examine
possible supplementary programs which
will have to be implemented. For
example, an efficient and
broad-reaching information system
would have to be set up to inform
parents and students of the types and
quality of education being offered by
each school, and which system would
produce the type of education sought.
Professor Levin is particularly
interested in the proposed system,
seeing that the poor would receive
equal educational opportunities. In
light of the present inadequacies, he
will study the possibility of setting up
community counseling and work with
poor parents to inform them of the
potential of the "voucher" system.

I HEAR YOU, I HEAR YOU—Stanford's 150-foot radio antenna will be
pointing towards the moon Friday when the Apollo spacecraft bounces
radar signals off the lunar surface. The giant dish will be used in
conjunction with NASA's Goldstone antenna to collect data that Stanford
scientists need to study the nature of the lunar crust.
