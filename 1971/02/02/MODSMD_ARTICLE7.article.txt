## Lodge â€” An Honest Man? 
### 
Harold I. segal, ph.d.

The matter of the disruption of
the Lodge speech raises issues
which deserve the most
thoughtful consideration by the
University community. It is a case
likely to lead to one of those
landmark decisions with wide
ramifications as a
precedent-maker among American
Universities. Both Professor
Pittendrigh and Professor Holman
have espoused views which meet
high standards of intelligence and
humanity and which are worthy
of serious attention by anyone
committed to the preservation
and extension of civilized society.
I would be content if either of
them were President of the
University or President of the
United States - a statement I
would not extend to include Dr.
Lyman. On the basis of the public
position of the latter, one can
only credit him with the most
superficial understanding of or
concern for what is involved.
As between the positions of
Professors Pittendrigh and
Holman, the emotional biases of
the latter appear to me to have
provided surer instincts.
Nevertheless, in the present

case the accusation which must be
judged, independent of
personalities, is that Lodge was
denied a hearing without
sufficient cause. I believe the
cause was fully sufficient. Few
with the reasonable knowledge of
American activities in Indochina
and Lodge's role in them which
one may demand as the
responsibility of enlightened
citizenship would deny that there
stands a prima facie case of
criminal activity against Lodge.
Ordinarily in the public posture
toward an accused criminal there
would take precedence the
presumption of innocence until
guilt be proven. However, this
presumption clearly depends upon
the expectation of prompt
processes to establish in open
court and with fair rules of
evidence the validity of the
accusation. The presumption of
innocence cannot bind when the
accused and the judicial
establishment are one and the
same body of men. Under such
conditions there can be no
alternative but for each citizen
concerned with the welfare of his
society to assume jurisdiction and

to arrive at his verdict as best he
can on the basis of the available
evidence and the relevant body of
common law of human
intercourse.
I have heard it argued that even
if this be true the accused has a
right to speak in his own behalf.
That is undeniably true, but not
the question at issue. The
question is, Did Lodge have a
right to come to Stanford as an
honored and respected guest? To
have sole ssession of the
podium? The <: .wer stands clearly
as No! To assert that Lodge was
denied freedom of speech to
present his case is patently absurd.
His case has been presented for
over ten years from every
communications medium and
with every authority of
establishment and prestige of
office in its support. If the case
against the demonstrators rests on
this flimsy a basis, there is no
intellectual integrity to it at all.
Had Lodge come in the
framework of responding to his
accusers, he would have deserved
the right of a full hearing with
every opportunity to present

evidence and argue his case. In
these circumstances the
accusation of a denial of his
freedom of speech would have at
least been a conceivable assertion.
But within the framework of his
appearance here what was being
protested was his being cast in the
role of a respected authority, as
the featured speaker in
connection with a
commemoration of the
establishment of the United
Nations!
There is no doubt that there is
reflected in the whole incident a
lack of understanding and
disregard of the whole basis and
purpose of a University. But those
who dese vr to be accused of
these failures are the ones who
invited Lodge here in this context.
Justice demands that they be
called to answer for these
transgressions. The actions of
those who disrupted this charade
impeded not freedom of speech
but the conspiracy of pretense
that Henry Cabot Lodge may be
received as an honest man. The
honor of the University was well
served thereby.
