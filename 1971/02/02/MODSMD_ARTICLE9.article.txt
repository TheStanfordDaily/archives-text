In Friday's Daily Professor
Colin S. Pittendrigh proposed that
I be kicked out of Stanford
because I don't accept, either in
theory or practice, his belief in
the radical dichotomy between
mind and body and the resulting
total supremacy of disembodied
mind.
We must recognize, as he
apparently does not, that his
argument is an important prop for
the unjust and privilege
enjoyed by himself, his social
peers and superiors. In fact his
argument represents one side in
the main ideological and class
struggle of our age (fortunately
the losing side).
Professor Pittendrigh defines

"the nature and function of the
University as a social institution"
as "the institutionalization of
mind." He thus functions within
the tradition of Plato and his
Academy. That is, he uses
philosophical idealism as an
ideological weapon in the
last-ditch fight to preserve the
power of an obsolescent social
class. The society conjured up in
the Academy, a Republic ruled by
a purely reasonable
philosopher-king, was in reality a
slave society. The society
conjured up in Professor
Pittendrigh's imaginary Stanford
is in reality a world-wide empire
pouring profits into the laps of
the Board of Trustees and
granting some handsome leftover
benefits to him and the rest of us
professors. His purely reasonable
modern Academy includes the
School of Business, the School of
Engineering, the Hoover
Institution, and R.O.T.C.
How can there be such a
discrepancy between reality and
Professor Pittendrigh's perception
of it? In an article in the
November, 1970, issue of College
English, I described the Professor
Pittendrighs of our society and
why they believe what they do.
In the dialectics of history,
culture is primarily an expression
of objective economic and social
relations and only secondarily an
influence upon these relations.
Petty bourgeois intellectuals
cannot grasp this concept, for
they believe that ideas come
primarily from other ideas, so that
a true intellectual must be a pure
intellectual. They are therefore
condemned to the delusion that

they and their ideas are not the
products of their class and
historical experience . . .
Why are most professors
shocked when a few professors
use their bodies to effect social
change? Why do they find this not
only non-intellectual but
"mindless"? Because bourgeois
values teach that there are two
different kinds of
activityâ€”physical and mental. On
one side, we have beings who
work with their bodies. These are
mindless, less than human. Then
there are those who think,
intellectuals, disembodied
intelligences whose physical
existence is essentially irrelevant
to what they think.
The consciousness of these
professors, like all consciousness,
comes from the condition of their
being. Their political and social
ideas are essentially
rationalizations to justify and
support their privileged existence.
They are philosophical idealists
because they literally cannot
afford to recognize the source of
their material comforts. They
"deplore" the most blatantly
vicious aspects of U.S. imperialism
while hiding from the fact that
their own university is one of the
principal institutions of the
imperialist system. They think
that Stanford University, which
designs much of the strategy and
weapons of the war against the
peoples of Southeast Asia, is an
institute of pure and disinterested
"mind." Their ideas are as
doomed as the system they
support. Power to the people!
