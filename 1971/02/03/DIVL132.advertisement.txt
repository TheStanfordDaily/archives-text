Today In The ''Daily''
Today is February 3, 1971 and to commemorate today someone
has formed a new organization on campus. It's called Students for
Intervention in the Tuna War (S.l.T. W.) and is protesting the
Ecuadorian seizure of American tuna boats claiming, Don t let
America be chicken of the sea!"
With slogans such as "Out of Vietnam and Into Ecuador!" and
"All the Way to Quito!" the organization claims to be a division of
the James Monroe-Teddy Roosevelt League, also known as the Big
Stick League or the B.S. League.
