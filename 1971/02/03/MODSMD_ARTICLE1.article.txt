# U.S. Supports Invasion Of Laos; American News Embargo Enforced
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
South Vietnamese troops with
American air support have entered
Laos, according to Japanese, Soviet,
and other worldwide news sources.
CBS news, however, indicated earlier
yesterday evening that high Washington
officials denied reports of an allied
invasion. CBS reported that President
Nixon was meeting with his highest
advisors to discuss such a possibility.
Meanwhile military officials have
prohibited American newsmen from
making any reports on the operations.
The "very unusual news embargo" has
been in effect for five days according to
the New York Times. The embargo
itself is under embargo in other words,
a correspondent Is not able to tell his
readers that he is not able to tell them
anything.
The invasion reports came from the
Japanese Kyodo News agency, the
Soviet government newspaper Izvestia,
Radio Hanoi, and other sources
throughout the world.
Laird No Comment
In Washington, Secretary of Defense
Melvin Laird refused to comment on
reports the allied forces had launched a
massive assault against a Communist
buildup in the border area of South
Vietnam and Laos.
He declared that no U.S. ground
troops have been sent into Laos and
pledged that none would be sent, in
keeping with congressional strictures.
The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee called on the Nixon
Administration to explain military
operations near Laos, and said it has
invited Laird and Secretary of State
William P. Rogers to testify about the
situation "as soon as possible."
On campus the newly-formed

Coalition Against the War in Indochina
has set up an information center in
White Plaza. (For more information on
their efforts see column on page two.)
According to the Kyodo report
4,000 to 5,000 South Vietnamese
paratroopers jumped into southern
Laos on Monday. The paratroopers
were supported by U.S. planes and
helicopters and are attempting to cut
North Vietnamese supply routes.
U.S. Backup Troops
Reliable sources in Washington said
a plan worked out by Washington and
Saigon envisaged use of 25 ,000 South
Vietnamese and 9,000 U.S. troops in
strikes against the Ho Chi Minh Trail.
The Americans would be limited to
backup operations in South Vietnam,
concentrating on Route 9 which
parallels the Demilitarized Zone in the
northern part of South Vietnam and
leads into Laos.
The Kyodo dispatch reported that
the South Vietnamese would be
operating for a week or 10 days on the
Bolovens Plateau - 95 to 125 miles
south of the former U.S. Marine base at
Khe Sanh in northern South Vietnam.
Laotian officials in Vientiane, as
well as foreign diplomats in the Laotian
capital, speculated that a South
Vietnamese invasion of the country
could trigger a coup and a military
response from Red China.
Threaten Chinese Security?
Foreign diplomats said the Red
Chinese might feel their security
threatened by a South Vietnamese
invasion into Laos, which borders the
Chinese mainland.
In Vientiane, the government of
Laos did not confirm reports of any
invasion but said the United States had
increased its heavy bombing raids in the
last several days. Laotion military

spokesmen repeated their opposition to
any military incursion, but indicated
that their troops were in no position to
do anything if one should take place.
The Soviet news agency Tass quoted
Premier Alexei Kosygin assaying South
Vietnamese troops had invaded Laos
and said the United States "is still
advancing down the road of agression."
Kosygin said new reports Tuesday
showed the South Vietnamese with the
support of their "American masters
spread the military actions in southern
Laos."
The Soviet Government cannot help
giving serious attention to the further
aggravation of the stiuation in
Indochina where an outrageous
invasion of the southern provinces of
Laos is underway," Tass reported
Kosygin as saying.
An official statement by the Viet
Cong Foreign Ministry broadcast by
Radio Hanoi said South Vietnamese
and Thai mercenary units were carrying
out raids in southern Laos that
thousands more Vietnamese troops
were massed on the border and that
three U.S. tankers had sailed into the
Tonkin Gulf near North Vietnam.
Open Hearings
In Washington Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman J. W.
Fulbright announced plans for what
could become the committee's most
far-ranging public hearings yet on the
Indochina War.
Administration officials, senators
and war critics would testify on ways
to end the conflict at hearings which
Fulbright said might start later this
month.
Secretary Laird on Capitol Hill was
asked, "What's going on in Laos and I
Corps in Vietnam; what can you tell us,
sir?"
Laird replied: "We had a very

pleasant hearing this morning before
the Senate Armed Services Committee
on the extension of the draft for two
vears."
Ik In a further exchange, Laird said no
. ground troops have been sent into
Laos and pledged that none would be.
"I'm sure that you are all familiar with
the outline of the rules for the
protection of the safety of American
forces," Laird said at another point,
and I want to make sure that we will
not open any credibility gap, and it
shall not be opened by any statement
which I make at this time."
