4 Austere 9 Budget Proposed
SACRAMENTO—Gov. Reagan proposed yesterday a "very austere" $6.7 4 billion
balanced budget which slashed welfare spending by more than $700 million and
levies no tax increases.
The governor's proposed budget for the fiscal year starting July 1 offers no
cost-of-living pay increase for state employes and trims their ranks by 2 ,4 28 down
to 18 2,537.
It also holds the line on spending for the nine-campus University of California
and advs university and state college professors to handle expected enrollment
increases by teaching more hours.
University of California President Charles J. Hitch said he was "dismayed that
no allowance was made in the governor's budget for general academic saiary
increases" since UC salaries "have fallen seriously behind those of comparable
institutions..."
He said the denial of pay raises to the faculty "places in jeopardy the morale
and standing of the university." Some faculty members will leave because of this,
he said
"For the general campuses, the budget not only fails to provide the 28 0
faculty positions we requested, but it eliminates 100 faculty positions which we
now have," Hitch said.
"Without these faculty positions, UC will find it almost impossible to
implement needed improvement in undergraduate education, which has suffered
relatively over the years from the rapid growth of graduate education and
research."
State College Chancellor Glenn S. Dumke said "major adjustments" would be
necessary if the legislature approves the proposed budget for fiscal year 1 971 -72 ,
which does not provide for salary increases or capital outlay and provides $53.3
million less than requested in general support.
The report from his office was more explicit, saying some programs in the
2 4 2,000 student system would have to be curtailed, others terminated, class sizes
increased and faculty positions reduced by 25 0.
In addition, the report said equipment would not be provided to make newly
completed buildings available and yearly tuition fees for out of state students
would nearly double, from $600 to $1,000. Waivers on those fees, now granted
occasionally, would not be available at all, the report said.
A polio 9 s Mission Go
SPACE CENTER, Houston — Relaxed and good natured, the Apollo 14
astronauts sped through space yesterday right on time for arrival tomorrow in
lunar orbit and an exploration the next day on the surface of the moon.
Mission Control said spacemen Alan B. Shepard Jr., Stuart A. Roosa and Edgar
D. Mitchell dozed off and on yesterday they awoke occasionally to look back in
awe at their mother planet and said they already saw the brownish gray texture of
the moon ahead.
A busy workday awaited the spacemen.
The flight plan caljed for Shepard and Mitchell to open a tunnel in the lunar
module, Antares, attached to the command ship, Kitty Hawk. They then enter
Antares and check out its system, making sure it's ready to land on the moon on
Friday morning.
A 10-second rocket burn Monday night changed the Apollo 14 flight plan
slightly and assured it of an on-time rocket into lunar orbit at 2 01 a.m.,
tomorrow . The lunar landing is scheduled for 4:16 a.m., Friday.
Mission Control said the burn Monday was not as precise as had been planned
and Apollo 14 will be slightly outside the predicted point of arrival in moon orbit.
This was not considered a problem, however, because later rocket firings will
refine the flight path.
Laird Supports Volunteer Army
WASHINGTON — Secretary of Defense Melvin R. Laird rejected yesterday the
idea that frontline soldiers in an all-volunteer Army would consist primarily of
blacks and other disadvantaged, minority citizens.

"This will not be the major problem," he said. "We will have a well-rounded,
well-trained military service il Congress provides sufficient pay and education
incentives.
He estimated it would cost an additional $5 billion a year for servicemen's
salaries il the nation is to attract and keep sufficient volunteers so the draft can be
ended safely.
Laird gave his views before a skeptical Senate Armed Services Committee as he
presented the administration's plea for a two-year extension of the draft and 5 0
percent pay hike lor lower-grade enlisted men as part of the plan to eliminate the
draft by mid-197 3
Committee Chairman John C. Stennis, D-Miss., said going into the market
place to compete on a salary basis for men would attract a great number of
dropouts, misfits, ne'er-do-wells, whatever you want to call them.
Stennis asserted also that to compete for men on a salary basis instead of
drafting men Ironi all walks of life would destroy the spirit of the modern
American Army.
Laird insisted it is difficult to attract men into the services because of the low
pay scales, noting that a New York City policemen receives $9 ,5 00 a year to start.
By comparison, he said, a recruit who has just completed basic training receives
only $2,700 a year-$6OO less than the federally established minimum wage which
amounts to $3,300 a year.
Military Aid From Food Funds
WASHINCTON — The State Department told Congress yesterday that $693.1
million in Food For Peace funds have been converted into military assistance for
Korea and South Vietnam, and other countries since 1 965.
Undersecretary of State John N. Irwin, testifying before the Senate-House
Economic Committee, said the conversions were made with U.S. permission over
the past six years from local currencies generated by the program.
The money derives from the sale of American foodstuffs for local currencies.
Irwin said the money can be used for any purpose that the receiving country sees
fit, consistent with its wellbeing and security.
Connolly's Nomination Approved
WASHINCTON — The Senate Finance Committee gave 13-0 approval Tuesday to
the nomination of John B. Connally as secretary of the Treasury, acting after the
former Texas governor testified earlier government service cost him nearlv
$500,000.
The action apparently ensured easy Senate confirmation for Connally who
would become the only Democrat in President Nixon's Cabinet. The vote was
originally announced as 11 -0, but two other senators recorded their votes later.
