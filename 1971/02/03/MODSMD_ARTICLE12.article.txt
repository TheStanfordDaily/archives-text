SOVIET JEW
Lyuba Bershadskaya, survivor of ten
years in a Siberian concentration camp,
will speak tonight at 7:30 p.m. in
Memorial Church on the subject of
Jews in the Soviet Union.
She is one of the few Soviet Jews to
win an emigration visa after years of
petitions to the Soviet hierarchy and
smuggled letters to the free world and
to the United Nations.
Her appearance at Stanford is
co-sponsored by Stanford Hillel and the
Bay Area Council on Soviet Jewry.
PANOFSKY
Professor W. K. H. Panofsky,
Director of SLAC and arms control

expert, will speak on "The Strategic
Arms Race" tonight at 8 in Bishop
Auditorium.
In his speech, Prof. Panofsky will
describe why the new weapons which
are the next round of the arms
race—missiles with multiple warheads
and anti-missile missiles—will stimulate
the arms race still further, because their
mission is ambiguous.
