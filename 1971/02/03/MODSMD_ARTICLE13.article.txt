Dinkelspiel Theft
Santa Clara County sheriff's
detectives yesterday were seeking
suspects in a weekend burglary that
literally put the University's Music-
Department recording studio out of
business.
Stolen sometime between 7:30
Sunday evening and 11:15 Monday
morning were the entire contents of the
Dinkelspiel Auditorium recording
studio, valued at $6,000, and located in
a backstage booth overlooking the
stage.
Removed were a $2,8 00 Ampex
two-track tape recorder and
reproducer, amplifiers, speakers,
microphones and other equipment
including the connecting cords.
Officer William R. Beck of the
Stanford Police Department said the
suspects apparently removed the
equipment by placing a 30 foot ladder
from the stage to the recording booth.
Heavy equipment was lowered to the
stage by microphone cords which were
left at the scene.
The burglars gained entry to the
booth by prying the door off with a
pinch bar, inflicting much damage to
the door-jamb. They apparently
entered through a rear stage door which
was accidentally left unlocked or to
which they possessed a key.
Any major recording at Dink will be
curtailed seriously by the theft, police
said. The theft was the largest of the
academic year to date. A few years ago

a similar burglary in which all the
electronic equipment of KZSU was
taken put Stanford student radio
station off the air for the remainder of
Jie year.
Dean Appointed

associate dean of Undergraduate
Studies, according to James L. Gibbs
Jr., dean of Undergraduate Studies.

devote one-half of her time, Siegel will
work with extra-departmental programs
and inter-school majors for
undergraduates.
Consultant Named

with experience in business, research,
and academic administration, has been
appointed a consultant on affirmative
action for women to President Richard
W. Lyman.
As consultant to the President, she

and recommend changes needed to
eliminate sex discrimination in
employment.
