# Restricted Admission To Hearing; SJC Defense Declares Defiance
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Seven students charged with
disrupting Henry Cabot Lodge's speech
here Jan. 11 yesterday warned that
their next Stanford Judicial Council
(SJC) hearing this Monday will be an
open one.
The statement came three days after
the SJC declared that admission to this
Monday's hearing will be restricted "to
a limited number of persons selected by
the defendants, the University
administration, or the Council."
In a four-page open letter to
President Richard Lyman, the Defense
Collective, as the accused and their
counsel call themselves, also demanded:
the reinstatement of the four defendants
suspended for contempt at Friday's
hearing, the reprimand and removal of
SJC Chairman Howard Williams, and
the dropping of .ill charges arising out
of the alleged Lodge disruption.(The
letter is reprinted on Page 2.)
Jumps Siena, leeal advisor to the

President, said last night that he had no
knowledge of Lyman's office receiving
the letter. Lyman is currently out of
town.
Oppose Lyman Plan
The Defense Collective in its letter
declared, "The hearing next Monday
will not be a closed hearing, as Williams
and Lyman plan. There is no way that
interested people will be prevented
from seeing these proceedings. The
only 'fair trial' on Monday will be an
open, public hearing on the real
crimes."
The collective also declared, "It is
now clear to all disinterested observers
that the Defense Collective cannot I'et a
fair hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council," claiming that
"proceedings of last Thursday and
Friday have made this
obvious." "Analysis of Williams's
actions," the letter added, shows that
the SJC is a "veil" which is "invoked at
the convenience of the Administration

to create the illusion of due process and
student participation, an illusion that
can never become a reality unless direct
action is taken.
Any Means Necessary
"The only recourse to the people is
to secure the President's cooperation
by any means necessary," the letter
noted.
It then demanded: reinstatement
with apologies of defendants Foote,
Holman, Weiss, and Youdelman,
suspended by Lyman on contempt
charges last Friday; the reprimand and
removal of Williams; and dismissal of all
charges concerning alleged disruption
of the Lodge speech here Han. 11.
The letter ended demanding that
what it termed "the real criminals" be
brought to trial â€” "Henry Cabol Lodge,
the Hoover Institution, the
military-industrial ruling class, the
Stanford trustees, and the repressive
political and judicial structures of this
IJniversilv and nation."
