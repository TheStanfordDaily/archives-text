# SWOPSI Course Popular
## FBI Warns Teacher-Cop 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
FBI agents allegedly warned a
Mountain View policeman to stop
teaching Stanford courses about the
police because "of all the radical
activities at Stanford."
Greg Morris, who quit his police job
soon after the warning, said the
message was relayed by a high-ranking
Mountain View police official.
Last quarter Morris taught a popular
SWOPSI course, "Police: A Closer
Look."
The official, whom Morris declined
to name, told him in December,
"Certain federal agencies have become
interested in your course because of the
national publicity you've received."
According to Morris, the official said
he had received a critical call from the
federal agents and it would "probably
be just as well" if Morris did not teach
at Stanford for a while.
Morris said "one would assume" the
FBI was the "certain agency"
mentioned. An agent at the Palo Alto
FBI office declined to comment on the
allegation.
Law School Goal
For six years, Morris worked as a
Mountain View policeman to pay for
his law classes at the University of
Santa Clara.
Before that, he was a Stanford
graduate in creative writing. He
returned to the campus in uniform last
spring for riot duty. Then, on his own
time, he led a police-student
"depolarization" program. Widespread
press coverage of his SWOPSI course
attracted the federal agents.
Morris said he was "stunned,

amazed, crushed" by the alleged FBI
warning, 'it's very ominous. It sounds
like Dr. Strangelove."
Student-Police Gap
He could think of no reason why the
FBI was not "happy-excited" about his
efforts to bridge the gap between
students and police.
Morris commented, however, that
because of images of campus radicals,
"Stanford's a pretty frightening thing
to a lot of people."
When he heard the warning, Morris
was so furious that he drove out to a
dump, sat thumbing through his law
books, and took out his frustrations by
shooting rats with his service revolver.
Soon after, the incident "made a
significant contribution" to his decision
to quit the Mountain View Police
Department, he said. Morris has since
become Administrative Assistant to the
City Manager of Saratoga.
But Morris said the incident also led
to a new determination not to be
"intimidated." He is going ahead with
plans to lead a miner research project
at Stanford.
Less Vulnerable Position
And he intends to go back into
police work when he has the
administrative training to hold a more
influential, less vulnerable position than
that of patrolman.
Morris fears he has been put on an
FBI blacklist. "I have these terrible
visions of my name being on a file
somewhere in the FBI.
"Fifteen years from now, when I'm
running for some office, I don't want
someone to say, 'He used to hang

around with Bruce Franklin.' That's
how things like that get started."
Now Morris's goal is "to make some
alterations in law enforcement that
would make it unnecessary for anyone
to check with the FBI."
Not From the Bottom
That requires changing the kind of
men in charge of police departments.
Most police chiefs now in power
think "J. Edgar Hoover can walk on
water," according to Morris.
Morris does not think FBI agents
actually snooped on any of his class
sessions. If they had, they would have
heard local police officials answering
questions and challenges from students.
Police Training Films
They would have seen Morris and his
class laugh at the simplistic "law and
order" messages of police training
films.
And they would have heard Morris's
idealistic assertions that police
departments can be improved "from
within, within the system."
He explained, 'There are a
significant number of people in law
enforcement who shouldn't be there,
who misuse their authority.
"But there is also a simmering mass
of concerned police officers who don't
know where to go."
But did his own clash with the FBI
disprove the possibility of working
from within?
"I can see that if I were of a
different philosophical bent, I would
view it as a sign of the massive faults of
our political system. But I'm a
cop ... I intend to try again, and we'll
find out."

be just as well" if Morris did not teach
at Stanford for a while.
Morris said "one would assume" the
FBI was the "certain agency"
mentioned. An agent at the Palo Alto
FBI office declined to comment on the
allegation.
Law School Goal
For six years, Morris worked as a
Mountain View policeman to pay for
his law classes at the University of
Santa Clara.
Before that, he was a Stanford
graduate in creative writing. He
returned to the campus in uniform last
spring for riot duty. Then, on his own
time, he led a police-student
"depolarization" program. Widespread
press coverage of his SWOPSI course
attracted the federal agents.
Morris said he was "stunned,

amazed, crushed" by the alleged FBI
warning, 'it's very ominous. It sounds
like Dr. Strangelove."
Student-Police Gap
He could think of no reason why the
FBI was not "happy-excited" about his
efforts to bridge the gap between
students and police.
Morris commented, however, that
because of images of campus radicals,
"Stanford's a pretty frightening thing
to a lot of people."
When he heard the warning, Morris
was so furious that he drove out to a
dump, sat thumbing through his law
books, and took out his frustrations by
shooting rats with his service revolver.
Soon after, the incident "made a
significant contribution" to his decision
to quit the Mountain View Police
Department, he said. Morris has since
become Administrative Assistant to the
City Manager of Saratoga.
But Morris said the incident also led
to a new determination not to be
"intimidated." He is going ahead with
plans to lead a miner research project
at Stanford.
Less Vulnerable Position
And he intends to go back into
police work when he has the
administrative training to hold a more
influential, less vulnerable position than
that of patrolman.
Morris fears he has been put on an
FBI blacklist. "I have these terrible
visions of my name being on a file
somewhere in the FBI.
"Fifteen years from now, when I'm
running for some office, I don't want
someone to say, 'He used to hang

around with Bruce Franklin.' That's
how things like that get started."
Now Morris's goal is "to make some
alterations in law enforcement that
would make it unnecessary for anyone
to check with the FBI."
Not From the Bottom
That requires changing the kind of
men in charge of police departments.
Most police chiefs now in power
think "J. Edgar Hoover can walk on
water," according to Morris.
Morris does not think FBI agents
actually snooped on any of his class
sessions. If they had, they would have
heard local police officials answering
questions and challenges from students.
Police Training Films
They would have seen Morris and his
class laugh at the simplistic "law and
order" messages of police training
films.
And they would have heard Morris's
idealistic assertions that police
departments can be improved "from
within, within the system."
He explained, 'There are a
significant number of people in law
enforcement who shouldn't be there,
who misuse their authority.
"But there is also a simmering mass
of concerned police officers who don't
know where to go."
But did his own clash with the FBI
disprove the possibility of working
from within?
"I can see that if I were of a
different philosophical bent, I would
view it as a sign of the massive faults of
our political system. But I'm a
cop ... I intend to try again, and we'll
find out."

FORMER POLICEMAN—Greg Morris, who, as a Mountain View Policeman,
taught a SVVOPSI course last quarter, was allegedly warned by the FBI not to
teach any more Stanford courses.
FBI agents allegedly warned a
Mountain View policeman to stop
teaching Stanford courses about the
police because "of all the radical
activities at Stanford."
Greg Morris, who quit his police job
soon after the warning, said the
message was relayed by a high-ranking
Mountain View police official.
Last quarter Morris taught a popular
SWOPSI course, "Police: A Closer
Look."
The official, whom Morris declined
to name, told him in December,
"Certain federal agencies have become
interested in your course because of the
national publicity you've received."
According to Morris, the official said
he had received a critical call from the
federal agents and it would "probably
be just as well" if Morris did not teach
at Stanford for a while.
