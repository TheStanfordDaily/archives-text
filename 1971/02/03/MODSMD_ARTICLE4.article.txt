# Overhauls Urged Housing System By Recent Report On Residences
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
University residence halls may be in
for some significant changes in staffing
and orientation.
That's the thrust of the report of the
Study Group on Residential Education
released last week.
Faculty overseers to be called
"Resident Fellows" or "Faculty
Coordinators"—should take over nearly
all administration and direction at the
house and hall level. They should be
assisted by students acting as "House
Associates" and "Senior House
Associates," who will supplant present
resident assistants, sponsors, and
freshman coordinators, the report
recommended.
The staff selection process will be
made, in the words of Study Group
Chairwoman Nancy H. Packer, assistant
prof, of English, "more amenable to the
community, with more input from the

community." Residence education
programs will be expanded and
developed; the establishment, by
residents, of "theme houses" will be
encouraged, if report recommendations
are followed.
Characteristics of Life
The Study Group first defined the
characteristics of life in the residences
according to eight "indices"—academic,
intellectual, aesthetic, social,
vocational, ethical, recreational, and
interpersonal.
It focuses on applying these indices
to the freshman residence program and
calls the University policy requiring
freshmen to live in the University
housing system "a sound one.
"The pressures on a freshman in a
University like this one are so great that
he needs to be as free as possible of
quotidian concerns so that he may
discover the many opportunities within
the University."

Using the freshman residence
program as a model, the report
concludes that "the integration of
academic and intellectual activities with
other dimensions of life within the
residences is an important goal."
To that end, it proposes that
programs of formal instruction be
instituted in all houses— Freshman
English and European History
Colloquia in houses having freshmen,
Undergraduate Specials in three- and
four-class residences.
Recommendations
Major recommendations for changes
in the residence staff structure include:
- Most residences should have live-in
resident fellow, and those that do not
will have a non-resident faculty
coordinator. The fraternity faculty
resident program should be
discontinued.
—'The present structure of resident
assistants, sponsors, and tutors should
be replaced with one .<f "House"
Associates" and, in some instances,
"Senior House Associates," who could
be either graduates or undergraduates.
—Committees including faculty,
student, and administrative
representatives would screen all faculty
and student staff.
The result of these changes would be
that, the Wilbur houses and most Stern
houses would be staffed by resident
fellows: Roble, Branner, and Toyon,
would each be staffed by one resident
fellow and an administrative assistant;
and Florence Moore and Eaguanity by
a faculty coordinator and an assistant.
Present non-faculty residence
directors, according to an informed
source, will be "reassigned."
