## Fight The Invasion Of Laos! 
### 
harry cleaver

Nixon's invasion of Laos has begun. We,
who oppose the war, must begin to fight that
invasion now.
There has been a government news blackout
in the Pentagon and in Saigon since Friday
when Secretary of State Rogers announced
that U.S. policy now includes the possibility of
unlimited bombing throughout Indochina. But
Saturday and Sunday evenings the major TV
networks carried reports from Russia and N.
Vietnam that U.S. and South Vietnamese
forces were massing to invade Laos.
Tuesday morning under banner headlines
of—ALLIES INVADE LAOS- the Mercury
and Chronicle carried a Japanese newservice
story that an invasion of Southern Laos is
underway with U.S. air and logistics support
and South Vietnamese troops. Yesterday
afternoon Laird refused comment and "placed
his faith in General Abrams."
There can be little doubt that Nixon, faced
with growing losses in Cambodia is trying to
cut the Ho Chi Minh trails in Laos. The
complete iu.lure of both the Cambodian
invasion and jbsequent efforts to bolster Lon
Nol JA and Green Beret trained
mercenaries has left Nixon with only two
options: admit defeat and withdraw from
Cambodia or escalate the war into all of
Cambodia and Southern Laos to try and
obliterate the population guerrillas and peasant
allies the way Northern Laos has been wiped
out during the last few years.
Nixon has chosen the latter and begun that
destruction.
Military failure of the invasion might spur
Nixon to use nuclear weapons to create a
radiation barrier. Temporary success would
provide time for planting of nuclear land mines
both popular tactics at the Pentagon.
Only massive protest by U.S. citizens can
reverse this policy through political pressure.
The recent Gallup poll showing that 7 3% of the
American people support setting a definite
date for total withdrawal suggests that the

political support is there if only we move to
mobilize it.
Last Spring when Nixon ordered the
invasion of Cambodia and hoped to establish
an American presence there he was thwarted
by the massive outpouring of public
indignation on campuses and in the
community. Hundreds of campuses exploded
in rage; a Hood of mail berated senators to
oppose the invasion; demonstrations were held
throughout the country. Those actions didn't
end the war but they did guarantee the passing
of the congressional ban on the use of U.S.
ground forces in Cambodia.
And thai ban has hurt Nison's efforts badly.
He was forced to become an outright liar by
ignoring his June promise not to use US
airpower for combat support and logistics.
Even the use of threat airpower has proved
ineffective. Route 4 remains closed. Phnom
Penh is still under seige.
Stanford was one of the first university
communities to rise up last spring—l think it
we should make it a tradition and begin to act
now.
Last year the University administration was
fighting to maintain ROTC in face of anti-war
demands for its removal. This year it is
supporting an equally obnoxious position— the
expulsion of students, a professor, and a
worker for disrupting a speech of one of the
architects of the War. 1 hope that we can bring
the current conflict to the same end as the last
victory for anti-war forces and the building°of
a strong movement against the invasion.
What ever one's position on the SJC farce
there are many ways of fighting this new
escalation of the War. The threat of shutting
down the campus speaks directly to the White
House and every quarter of the ruling class
because it strips them of some of their most
important institutions. Pressure on Congress to
enact new legislation such as that banning
funds for US ground forces in Cambodia can

push congressmen who have vested political
interests in fighting Nixon. Legislation to ban
use of US air power in Laos and Cambodia and
to ban the use of nuclear weapons in
Indochina would clearly hurt Nixon's plans.
There are many possibilities and many
people to elaborate them. What we need is to
begin to consider them.
Monday night a group of worried people
Irom many different political perspectives and
constituencies ("pacifists," "moderates,"
"radicals") came together to talk about the
gravity of the new escalation. Out of that
meeting grew a common aim—to mobilize the
largest opposition force possible. They decided
to call themselves the Coalition Against the
War in Indochina (CAWI) and to maintain an
information center throughout the crisis.
The Coalition is asking members of the
Stanford Palo Alto CommunJ|' to form groups
in their dorms or neighbor) Jids, departments
or workplaces to discuss what we can do to
oppose the war. I urge every concerned
member of the campus community to do just
that.
The SJC defendents are sponsering an
educational meeting Thursday night to discuss
their case and the new developments of the
war. I also urge people to attend that meeting.
The CAWI will meet again Friday afternoon
at 4 :00 in Tresidder Union. The meeting will
not be a "mass meeting" but is intended to set
up a framework for organizing the community
of outrage that seems to be willing up in the
community.
If we act with determination and energy we
can perhaps help generate a movement that
can effectively oppose this new widening of
the war. We have done it before and can do it
again if we will.

complete iu.lure of both the Cambodian
invasion and jbsequent efforts to bolster Lon
Nol JA and Green Beret trained
mercenaries has left Nixon with only two
options: admit defeat and withdraw from
Cambodia or escalate the war into all of
Cambodia and Southern Laos to try and
obliterate the population guerrillas and peasant
allies the way Northern Laos has been wiped
out during the last few years.
Nixon has chosen the latter and begun that
destruction.
Military failure of the invasion might spur
Nixon to use nuclear weapons to create a
radiation barrier. Temporary success would
provide time for planting of nuclear land mines
both popular tactics at the Pentagon.
Only massive protest by U.S. citizens can
reverse this policy through political pressure.
The recent Gallup poll showing that 7 3% of the
American people support setting a definite
date for total withdrawal suggests that the

political support is there if only we move to
mobilize it.
Last Spring when Nixon ordered the
invasion of Cambodia and hoped to establish
an American presence there he was thwarted
by the massive outpouring of public
indignation on campuses and in the
community. Hundreds of campuses exploded
in rage; a Hood of mail berated senators to
oppose the invasion; demonstrations were held
throughout the country. Those actions didn't
end the war but they did guarantee the passing
of the congressional ban on the use of U.S.
ground forces in Cambodia.
And thai ban has hurt Nison's efforts badly.
He was forced to become an outright liar by
ignoring his June promise not to use US
airpower for combat support and logistics.
Even the use of threat airpower has proved
ineffective. Route 4 remains closed. Phnom
Penh is still under seige.
Stanford was one of the first university
communities to rise up last spring—l think it
we should make it a tradition and begin to act
now.
Last year the University administration was
fighting to maintain ROTC in face of anti-war
demands for its removal. This year it is
supporting an equally obnoxious position— the
expulsion of students, a professor, and a
worker for disrupting a speech of one of the
architects of the War. 1 hope that we can bring
the current conflict to the same end as the last
victory for anti-war forces and the building°of
a strong movement against the invasion.
What ever one's position on the SJC farce
there are many ways of fighting this new
escalation of the War. The threat of shutting
down the campus speaks directly to the White
House and every quarter of the ruling class
because it strips them of some of their most
important institutions. Pressure on Congress to
enact new legislation such as that banning
funds for US ground forces in Cambodia can

push congressmen who have vested political
interests in fighting Nixon. Legislation to ban
use of US air power in Laos and Cambodia and
to ban the use of nuclear weapons in
Indochina would clearly hurt Nixon's plans.
There are many possibilities and many
people to elaborate them. What we need is to
begin to consider them.
Monday night a group of worried people
Irom many different political perspectives and
constituencies ("pacifists," "moderates,"
"radicals") came together to talk about the
gravity of the new escalation. Out of that
meeting grew a common aim—to mobilize the
largest opposition force possible. They decided
to call themselves the Coalition Against the
War in Indochina (CAWI) and to maintain an
information center throughout the crisis.
The Coalition is asking members of the
Stanford Palo Alto CommunJ|' to form groups
in their dorms or neighbor) Jids, departments
or workplaces to discuss what we can do to
oppose the war. I urge every concerned
member of the campus community to do just
that.
The SJC defendents are sponsering an
educational meeting Thursday night to discuss
their case and the new developments of the
war. I also urge people to attend that meeting.
The CAWI will meet again Friday afternoon
at 4 :00 in Tresidder Union. The meeting will
not be a "mass meeting" but is intended to set
up a framework for organizing the community
of outrage that seems to be willing up in the
community.
If we act with determination and energy we
can perhaps help generate a movement that
can effectively oppose this new widening of
the war. We have done it before and can do it
again if we will.

Nixon's invasion of Laos has begun. We,
who oppose the war, must begin to fight that
invasion now.
There has been a government news blackout
in the Pentagon and in Saigon since Friday
when Secretary of State Rogers announced
that U.S. policy now includes the possibility of
unlimited bombing throughout Indochina. But
Saturday and Sunday evenings the major TV
networks carried reports from Russia and N.
Vietnam that U.S. and South Vietnamese
forces were massing to invade Laos.
Tuesday morning under banner headlines
of—ALLIES INVADE LAOS- the Mercury
and Chronicle carried a Japanese newservice
story that an invasion of Southern Laos is
underway with U.S. air and logistics support
and South Vietnamese troops. Yesterday
afternoon Laird refused comment and "placed
his faith in General Abrams."
There can be little doubt that Nixon, faced
with growing losses in Cambodia is trying to

invasion of Cambodia and hoped to establish
an American presence there he was thwarted
by the massive outpouring of public
indignation on campuses and in the
community. Hundreds of campuses exploded
in rage; a Hood of mail berated senators to
oppose the invasion; demonstrations were held
throughout the country. Those actions didn't
end the war but they did guarantee the passing
of the congressional ban on the use of U.S.
ground forces in Cambodia.
And thai ban has hurt Nison's efforts badly.
He was forced to become an outright liar by
ignoring his June promise not to use US
airpower for combat support and logistics.
Even the use of threat airpower has proved
ineffective. Route 4 remains closed. Phnom
Penh is still under seige.
Stanford was one of the first university
communities to rise up last spring—l think it
we should make it a tradition and begin to act
now.
Last year the University administration was
fighting to maintain ROTC in face of anti-war
demands for its removal. This year it is
supporting an equally obnoxious position— the
expulsion of students, a professor, and a
worker for disrupting a speech of one of the
architects of the War. 1 hope that we can bring
the current conflict to the same end as the last
victory for anti-war forces and the building°of
a strong movement against the invasion.
What ever one's position on the SJC farce
there are many ways of fighting this new
escalation of the War. The threat of shutting
down the campus speaks directly to the White
House and every quarter of the ruling class
because it strips them of some of their most
important institutions. Pressure on Congress to
enact new legislation such as that banning
funds for US ground forces in Cambodia can

push congressmen who have vested political
interests in fighting Nixon. Legislation to ban
use of US air power in Laos and Cambodia and
to ban the use of nuclear weapons in
Indochina would clearly hurt Nixon's plans.
There are many possibilities and many
people to elaborate them. What we need is to
begin to consider them.
Monday night a group of worried people
Irom many different political perspectives and
constituencies ("pacifists," "moderates,"
"radicals") came together to talk about the
gravity of the new escalation. Out of that
meeting grew a common aim—to mobilize the
largest opposition force possible. They decided
to call themselves the Coalition Against the
War in Indochina (CAWI) and to maintain an
information center throughout the crisis.
The Coalition is asking members of the
Stanford Palo Alto CommunJ|' to form groups
in their dorms or neighbor) Jids, departments
or workplaces to discuss what we can do to
oppose the war. I urge every concerned
member of the campus community to do just
that.
The SJC defendents are sponsering an
educational meeting Thursday night to discuss
their case and the new developments of the
war. I also urge people to attend that meeting.
The CAWI will meet again Friday afternoon
at 4 :00 in Tresidder Union. The meeting will
not be a "mass meeting" but is intended to set
up a framework for organizing the community
of outrage that seems to be willing up in the
community.
If we act with determination and energy we
can perhaps help generate a movement that
can effectively oppose this new widening of
the war. We have done it before and can do it
again if we will.
