# try the real criminals
## Open Letter To President Lyman 
### 
defense collective

It is now clear to all
disinterested observers that the
Defense Collective cannot get a
fair hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council. The proceedings
of last Thursday and Friday have
made this obvious. Chairman
Howard Williams has acted in the
tradition of Judge Julius Hoffman
in his attempt to railroad our
conviction, as Bobby Seale was
railroaded in Chicago.
Fortunately, the penalties for us
are insignificant compared to the
possible execution of Bobb,
Chairman of "the Black Panther
Party.
In spite of consultation with
members of the Collective and
motions at the beginning of each
hearing, the hearings have been
deliberately scheduled in rooms
clearly not large enough to
accomodate all of the poeple who
wished to attend. Yet when the
people outside decided not to be
intimidated by the Stanford
police, and pushed past the armed
guards and filled the room, they
were courteous and almost too
decorous until the outrageous
behavior of Williams forced the
t recessing of the hearing some
three hours later. The audience's
behavior was a ringing rebuke to
Williams' pigheadedness.
Section 11.F.8. of the Charter
allows the disqualification of any
Council member for prejudice.

Howard Williams, ignoring every
pretense of justice, refused to
allow individual voir dire, the
individual examination of
members of the Council (as
established by SJC precedent) to
uncover overt, covert, or even
unconscious prejudice. He forced
the Defense to ask only questions
addressed to the panel as a whole
and answerable by 'yes' or 'no'.
Williams' attitude toward the
Defense has consistently been one
of contempt. He continually
turned down and ignored motions
and objections by the Defense
Collective. He sneered and
laughed at us and attempted to
intimidate us into silence.
The Charter makes no mention
of the contempt power of the
Chairman, summary or otherwise.
However, the Charter itself
precludes the possibility of any
limit on the President or whatever
mouthpiece happens to be
implementing his will at a given
time. Analysis of the Chairman's
actions in suspending the four
students and threatening whatever
action he can take against
Collective member Franklin
supports our contention that the
present Charter is nothing but a
veil for the still-unchecked power
of the President over the fate of
students. The veil is invoked at
the convenience of the
Administration to create the
illusion of due process and
student participation, an illusion
that can never become a reality
unless direct action is taken. The
only recourse to the people is to
secure the President's cooperation
by any means necessary.

Because this behavior by the
SJC and its Chairman has so
clearly indicated the futility of
hoping for a fair hearing, even by
their own standards, the Defense
Collective demands that you,
President Lyman, immediately
implement the following:
a. dismissal of all contempt
charges from Friday, January 29,
and the reinstatement, with
apologies, of Gerry Foote, Jeff
Youdelman, Janet Weiss, and
Mike Holman, whose unwarranted
suspensions on Friday represent
the full flowering of banditry
under color of law;
b. the reprimand and removal of
Howard Williams from the post of
Chairman of the SJC for his
actions in this case; and
c. the dismissal of all charges
against all persons in connection
with the incidents of January 11,
1971, in Dinkelspiel Auditorium,
the afternoon of the appearance
of war criminal« Henry Cabot
Lodge; this dismissal will
necessarily include reinstatement
of John Keilch to his position in
the Main Library with appropriate
back pay, interest, and damages,
and dismissal of all charges against
Bruce Franklin.
But the hearings are significant
as an illustration of the fascist
courts in which our brothers and
sisters across the country are
being tried. The issue at stake is
not merely the fact that the
Judicial Charter is a sham and can
be legally violated at will by the
SJC's Chairman and the President.
The issue is class interest. The
people who run Stanford
University and this country devise

the laws and courts which result
in the repression of anyone who
opposes their class interest. Black
and brown people who are
fighting for their liberation can be
legally shot in their sleep. On a
smaller scale, the Stanford
Judicial Council is set up to crush
the anti-war and anti-imperialist
movement on this campus. The
judicial structure of any
imperialist institution must
necessarily have this purpose. Just
as it is no accident that Bruce
Franklin was arrested in Redwood
City while under siege at
Stanford, so it is no accident that
repression intensifies at heme
while U.S. agression expands
around the world.
We understand that political
repression (fascism) is merely the
domestic counterpart of foreign
imperialist adventures. The
connections are being made by an
increasing number of people.
Events of the last week can only
further dispel the myth that this
campus is an "open forum."
The hearing next Monday will
not be a closed hearing, as
Williams and Lyman plan. There is
no way that interested people will
be prevented from seeing these
proceedings. The only "fair trial"
on Monday will be an open,
public hearing on the real crimes.
The massive bombing and invasion
of Laos, the fascist harassment of
Los Siete and the imprisonment
of Bobby Seale make it imperative
that the real criminals be brought
to trial—Henry Cabot Lodge, the
Hoover Institution, the
military-industrial ruling class, the
Stanford trustees, and the
repressive political and judicial
structures of this University and
nation.
(The 7 SJC defendents and
their counsels compose the
Defense Collective.)
