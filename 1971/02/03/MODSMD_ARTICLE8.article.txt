## Problems Of Justice

radical libertarians

The recent suspension of
several Stanford students for
contempt of the "judicial
proceedings" has been a cause for
alarm among members of the
Stanford Radical Libertarian
Alliance.
The Stanford Judicial Council
should be an exemplar of judicial
integrity. Its lack of legitimacy
among the community is perhaps
not unrelated to its present
policies.
The aim of the Stanford judicial

system should not be its apparent
present purpose of shoring up the
authority of the Administration,
but rather the finding of what
justice demands in the
circumstances of the case. The
maintenance of justice requires
that persons not violate each
others' rights.
A person should, of course,
only be suspended on the basis of
a written complaint with enough
evidence to prove the case.
The existence of contempt

rulings at Stanford and elsewhere
is a violation of the Anglo-Saxon
legal tradition's presumption that
a person is innocent until proven
guilty after the best possible case
has been put up in his defense. Of
course, if a person persists in
unusual behavior during his
defense, it can be assumed he is
conducting his defense in this
manner or is delaying the proper
proceedings of the court.
Whichever is the defendant's
intention, when the time
reasonably required to conduct a
defense has been taken up, the
case can be decided on the basis
of the available evidence.
Contempt is an attitude which
a person might well feel under
trying conditions. If behavior
which is now cited as
contemptuous by judges, is not in
violation of people's rights, it
should not be considered criminal.
There is no reason in principle
why the courtroom should
become a sacred enclave in which
an august personage (the judge) in
medieval vestments presides over
his charges in a tyrannical manner.
In contempt proceedings, the
judge is "judge in his own case."
There is no separation in such
cases between prosecutor and
judge. The judge charges the
defendant with contempt. The
judge then hears the case in which
he is allegedly the aggrieved party.
Then the judge, without benefit
of trial by jury, declares the
defendant guilty and pronounces
sentence. This is not justice, but a
travesty of justice. Those whose
behavior is non-aggressive are not
criminals. It is judges who
sentence men on whimsical and
unwarranted grounds who are
criminals.
If Stanford were a voluntary
community of scholars, in every
sense, rather than the institutional
handmaiden of the war criminals
and taxrobbers of the United
States government bureaucracy, a
true social contract would be
entered into by those joining this
community. Under general or
specific contracts, matters like the
adjudication of disputes would be
handled. Every judge would seek
community-wide recognition of
his fairness in order that cases
would be brought to him. There
would probably exist
Underwriters Laboratories-type
accreditation or certification
agencies subscribing to a common
legal code and demanding high
standards of conduct. Compared
with the free soceity which is
possible, the present tyranny both
at Stanford and elsewhere exists
in contempt of human liberty.

The recent suspension of
several Stanford students for
contempt of the "judicial
proceedings" has been a cause for
alarm among members of the
Stanford Radical Libertarian
Alliance.
The Stanford Judicial Council
should be an exemplar of judicial
integrity. Its lack of legitimacy
among the community is perhaps
not unrelated to its present
policies.
The aim of the Stanford judicial

system should not be its apparent
present purpose of shoring up the
authority of the Administration,
but rather the finding of what
justice demands in the
circumstances of the case. The
maintenance of justice requires
that persons not violate each
others' rights.
A person should, of course,
only be suspended on the basis of
a written complaint with enough
evidence to prove the case.
The existence of contempt

rulings at Stanford and elsewhere
is a violation of the Anglo-Saxon
legal tradition's presumption that
a person is innocent until proven
guilty after the best possible case
has been put up in his defense. Of
course, if a person persists in
unusual behavior during his
defense, it can be assumed he is
conducting his defense in this
manner or is delaying the proper
proceedings of the court.
Whichever is the defendant's
intention, when the time
reasonably required to conduct a
defense has been taken up, the
case can be decided on the basis
of the available evidence.
Contempt is an attitude which
a person might well feel under
trying conditions. If behavior
which is now cited as
contemptuous by judges, is not in
violation of people's rights, it
should not be considered criminal.
There is no reason in principle
why the courtroom should
become a sacred enclave in which
an august personage (the judge) in
medieval vestments presides over
his charges in a tyrannical manner.
In contempt proceedings, the
judge is "judge in his own case."
There is no separation in such
cases between prosecutor and
judge. The judge charges the
defendant with contempt. The
judge then hears the case in which
he is allegedly the aggrieved party.
Then the judge, without benefit
of trial by jury, declares the
defendant guilty and pronounces
sentence. This is not justice, but a
travesty of justice. Those whose
behavior is non-aggressive are not
criminals. It is judges who
sentence men on whimsical and
unwarranted grounds who are
criminals.
If Stanford were a voluntary
community of scholars, in every
sense, rather than the institutional
handmaiden of the war criminals
and taxrobbers of the United
States government bureaucracy, a
true social contract would be
entered into by those joining this
community. Under general or
specific contracts, matters like the
adjudication of disputes would be
handled. Every judge would seek
community-wide recognition of
his fairness in order that cases
would be brought to him. There
would probably exist
Underwriters Laboratories-type
accreditation or certification
agencies subscribing to a common
legal code and demanding high
standards of conduct. Compared
with the free soceity which is
possible, the present tyranny both
at Stanford and elsewhere exists
in contempt of human liberty.
