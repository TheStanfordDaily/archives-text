## Sportsmanship 
### Don Tollefson 
Remember good sportsmanship. That was what
your mother meant when she said "It isn't
whether you win or lose, it's how you play that
counts.'' A lot of coaches have repeated this line,
but few have really meant it.
Winning is what counts. Losiny coaches don't
get five year, $200,000 contracts. Losing players
don't do Rapid Shave or Autolite Spark Plug
commercials. In the world of competitive sports,
winning is what it's all about.
But just because winning is the most important
concern, this doesn't mean that good
sportsmanship is precluded. You can have both.
And you can exhibit good sportsmanship all the
time, even when you're losing which is pretty
important when you consider that 5 0% of the
competitors end up on the losing end.
Fortunately sports on the west coast seem to
have a little more class and sportsmanship than
elsewhere. The fans don't often attack the
officials; the players usually don't end up brawling
with each other; and most games end with at least
outwardly friendly exchanges between opposing
players.
When a guy gets knocked down in a basketball
game, the person who did it will often help him
up. When somebody gets hurt, opponents will
usually help him. Even the fans usually show quite
a bit of sophistication, as they seem to appreciate
good performances on both sides and don't
become too assininely partisan or red hot.
But there are exceptions. One is apparently the
University of Santa Clara, whose basketball team
and fans visited Maples Pavilion for a game Friday
night. The behavior of their 250 or so fans who sat
underneath the south basket, was hard to believe.
The behavior of the early arrivals who got their
for the freshman game was annoying. The Bronco
redhots kept screaming "Get a haircut" and
"Hippie-freak" at more than one Stanford player
whose hair looked long only in comparison to the
near-butches the Santa Clara players were wearing.
My hope that these apparently freshman
redhots might be calmed by some of the older fans
who would come for the varsity game was quickly
destroyed. The new fans only increased the
volume of the tirade.
They made all sorts of noise and snide remarks
while Stanford was shooting its free throws.
Throughout the game, they verbally jumped on
the backs of Stanford players for apparently no
other reason than the fact that their sideburns or
hair are long compared to the Santa Clara players.

But the crowning touch of adolescent behavior,
reminiscent of another time, came when many of
their fans booed or moaned when a Stanford
player was injured. When Pat Stevens injured his
head in the second half near the group of Bronco
rooters, they acted as if they enjoyed it.
But this behavior exhibited itself not only in
the stands. r l\vo men, apparently from the Santa
Clara Athletic Department, sat in the press box
and their comments were equally childish. And
when Stevens got hurt, one of them had the nerve
to say "Get a haircut!"
Even the players seemed to be callous and
empty of feeling. When Stevens and later Bob
Buell were injured none of the Broncos either
went to their aid or seemed to pay any attention.
And when their center dumped Buell late in the
game, it was one of the better cheap shots I've
seen.
Maybe Stanford and most Bay Area fans have
spoiled me. The Stanford fans seem to be usually
fair and recognize good play by both teams. Other
fans around here seem to be this way as well. And
the Stanford athletes usually lend a helping hand
or take an interest when somebody gets hurt.
I'm not in any way belittling the idea of going
all out to win. 10 0% effort is a necessary and
important part of sports. But good sportsmanship
and compassion can and should accompany the
attempt to win. Those who enjoy hurting other
people should get into another field. Sports can do
without them.

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR—The football season ended a little over a month ago, and
believe it or not, it's time for baseball again. The Stanford Indians won the first game
on their 5 6 game schedule 6-5 over the Philadelphia Philly rookies yesterday at the
Sunken Diamond.

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR—The football season ended a little over a month ago, and
believe it or not, it's time for baseball again. The Stanford Indians won the first game
on their 5 6 game schedule 6-5 over the Philadelphia Philly rookies yesterday at the
Sunken Diamond.
Remember good sportsmanship. That was what
your mother meant when she said "It isn't
whether you win or lose, it's how you play that
counts.'' A lot of coaches have repeated this line,
but few have really meant it.
Winning is what counts. Losiny coaches don't
get five year, $200,000 contracts. Losing players
don't do Rapid Shave or Autolite Spark Plug
commercials. In the world of competitive sports,
winning is what it's all about.
But just because winning is the most important
concern, this doesn't mean that good
sportsmanship is precluded. You can have both.
And you can exhibit good sportsmanship all the
time, even when you're losing which is pretty
important when you consider that 5 0% of the
competitors end up on the losing end.
Fortunately sports on the west coast seem to
have a little more class and sportsmanship than
elsewhere. The fans don't often attack the
officials; the players usually don't end up brawling
with each other; and most games end with at least
outwardly friendly exchanges between opposing
players.
When a guy gets knocked down in a basketball
game, the person who did it will often help him
up. When somebody gets hurt, opponents will
usually help him. Even the fans usually show quite
a bit of sophistication, as they seem to appreciate
good performances on both sides and don't
become too assininely partisan or red hot.
But there are exceptions. One is apparently the
University of Santa Clara, whose basketball team
and fans visited Maples Pavilion for a game Friday
night. The behavior of their 250 or so fans who sat
underneath the south basket, was hard to believe.
The behavior of the early arrivals who got their
for the freshman game was annoying. The Bronco
redhots kept screaming "Get a haircut" and
"Hippie-freak" at more than one Stanford player
whose hair looked long only in comparison to the
near-butches the Santa Clara players were wearing.
My hope that these apparently freshman
redhots might be calmed by some of the older fans
who would come for the varsity game was quickly
destroyed. The new fans only increased the
volume of the tirade.
They made all sorts of noise and snide remarks
while Stanford was shooting its free throws.
Throughout the game, they verbally jumped on
the backs of Stanford players for apparently no
other reason than the fact that their sideburns or
hair are long compared to the Santa Clara players.

But the crowning touch of adolescent behavior,
reminiscent of another time, came when many of
their fans booed or moaned when a Stanford
player was injured. When Pat Stevens injured his
head in the second half near the group of Bronco
rooters, they acted as if they enjoyed it.
But this behavior exhibited itself not only in
the stands. r l\vo men, apparently from the Santa
Clara Athletic Department, sat in the press box
and their comments were equally childish. And
when Stevens got hurt, one of them had the nerve
to say "Get a haircut!"
Even the players seemed to be callous and
empty of feeling. When Stevens and later Bob
Buell were injured none of the Broncos either
went to their aid or seemed to pay any attention.
And when their center dumped Buell late in the
game, it was one of the better cheap shots I've
seen.
Maybe Stanford and most Bay Area fans have
spoiled me. The Stanford fans seem to be usually
fair and recognize good play by both teams. Other
fans around here seem to be this way as well. And
the Stanford athletes usually lend a helping hand
or take an interest when somebody gets hurt.
I'm not in any way belittling the idea of going
all out to win. 10 0% effort is a necessary and
important part of sports. But good sportsmanship
and compassion can and should accompany the
attempt to win. Those who enjoy hurting other
people should get into another field. Sports can do
without them.

IT'S THAT TIME OF YEAR—The football season ended a little over a month ago, and
believe it or not, it's time for baseball again. The Stanford Indians won the first game
on their 5 6 game schedule 6-5 over the Philadelphia Philly rookies yesterday at the
Sunken Diamond.
Remember good sportsmanship. That was what
your mother meant when she said "It isn't
whether you win or lose, it's how you play that
counts.'' A lot of coaches have repeated this line,
but few have really meant it.
Winning is what counts. Losiny coaches don't
get five year, $200,000 contracts. Losing players
don't do Rapid Shave or Autolite Spark Plug
commercials. In the world of competitive sports,
winning is what it's all about.
But just because winning is the most important
concern, this doesn't mean that good
sportsmanship is precluded. You can have both.
And you can exhibit good sportsmanship all the
time, even when you're losing which is pretty
important when you consider that 5 0% of the
competitors end up on the losing end.
Fortunately sports on the west coast seem to
have a little more class and sportsmanship than
elsewhere. The fans don't often attack the
officials; the players usually don't end up brawling
with each other; and most games end with at least
outwardly friendly exchanges between opposing
players.
When a guy gets knocked down in a basketball
game, the person who did it will often help him
up. When somebody gets hurt, opponents will
usually help him. Even the fans usually show quite
a bit of sophistication, as they seem to appreciate
good performances on both sides and don't
become too assininely partisan or red hot.
But there are exceptions. One is apparently the
University of Santa Clara, whose basketball team
and fans visited Maples Pavilion for a game Friday
night. The behavior of their 250 or so fans who sat
underneath the south basket, was hard to believe.
The behavior of the early arrivals who got their
for the freshman game was annoying. The Bronco
redhots kept screaming "Get a haircut" and
"Hippie-freak" at more than one Stanford player
whose hair looked long only in comparison to the
near-butches the Santa Clara players were wearing.
My hope that these apparently freshman
redhots might be calmed by some of the older fans
who would come for the varsity game was quickly
destroyed. The new fans only increased the
volume of the tirade.
They made all sorts of noise and snide remarks
while Stanford was shooting its free throws.
Throughout the game, they verbally jumped on
the backs of Stanford players for apparently no
other reason than the fact that their sideburns or
hair are long compared to the Santa Clara players.

But the crowning touch of adolescent behavior,
reminiscent of another time, came when many of
their fans booed or moaned when a Stanford
player was injured. When Pat Stevens injured his
head in the second half near the group of Bronco
rooters, they acted as if they enjoyed it.
But this behavior exhibited itself not only in
the stands. r l\vo men, apparently from the Santa
Clara Athletic Department, sat in the press box
and their comments were equally childish. And
when Stevens got hurt, one of them had the nerve
to say "Get a haircut!"
Even the players seemed to be callous and
empty of feeling. When Stevens and later Bob
Buell were injured none of the Broncos either
went to their aid or seemed to pay any attention.
And when their center dumped Buell late in the
game, it was one of the better cheap shots I've
seen.
Maybe Stanford and most Bay Area fans have
spoiled me. The Stanford fans seem to be usually
fair and recognize good play by both teams. Other
fans around here seem to be this way as well. And
the Stanford athletes usually lend a helping hand
or take an interest when somebody gets hurt.
I'm not in any way belittling the idea of going
all out to win. 10 0% effort is a necessary and
important part of sports. But good sportsmanship
and compassion can and should accompany the
attempt to win. Those who enjoy hurting other
people should get into another field. Sports can do
without them.
