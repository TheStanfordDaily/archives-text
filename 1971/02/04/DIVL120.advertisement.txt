go to the nan who knows most about
his subject; it goes to the man who
knows most about his exam." This

Secret." Tested since 1954, this

in any kind of exam. Novel but proven
productive tips on notetsking, selec
tive memorization, concentration, and
the art of effective "bluff" make this

dent. More valuable than any
textbook. Money back if not

"Examination success does not always
go to the nan who knows most about
his subject; it goes to the man who
knows most about his exam." This
advice, from noted British scholar and
educator Dennis B. Jackson, is the key
to his amazing book "The Exam
Secret." Tested since 1954, this
revolutionary volume contains tech
niques that will improve your marks
in any kind of exam. Novel but proven
productive tips on notetsking, selec
tive memorization, concentration, and
the art of effective "bluff" make this
128-page book a must for every stu
dent. More valuable than any
textbook. Money back if not
completely satisfied. |:
