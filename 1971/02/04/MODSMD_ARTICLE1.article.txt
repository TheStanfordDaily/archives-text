# American Courts Face Severe Challenge
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
In October of 1969, Judge Julius Hoffman
made the unprecedented decision to gag and
shackle Black Panther Bobby Seale in the
courtroom where his trial was in progress. Last
week, during the trial of seven Stanford students
and one professor, the Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council, Howard Williams, made what
some feel was an equally enprecedented move in
suspending four of the defendants from the
University for the duration of the SJC trial.
The actions of these two men in vastly
different judicial situations reflect perhaps the
most serious problem facing the United States
Judicial system today. Courts at all levels of the
system are wrestling with the problem of what
to do about defendants that are bent on
distupting the orderly procedure of the
courtroom.
The courts have been unable to rid
themselves of the problems caused by disruption
at the hands of defendants. "At the moment,"
noted Stanford Law Professor Anthony
Amsterdam, "the whole legal system is
struggling to deal with this problem."
Another Stanford Law Professor and a
former Chairman of the Stanford Judicial

Council, Jack Friedenthal explained the problem
facing the courts when a defendant disrupts the
proceedings. "You have got to protect the
decisionmaker in a courtroom from intimidation
from all sides," Friedenthal said. "In other
words, you can't let the behavior of a defendant
get in the way of his trial."
Defendants in the Way
As Bobby Seale's case in 1 969 so vividly
points out, the court has devised some somber
ways to be sure that a defendant does not get in
the way of his own trial. The case of Illinois vs.
Allen outlined a variety of methods a judge can
use to deal with the defendant, in order to
subdue him, using increasingly stringent,
physical means.
Professor Amsterdam predicted that, "in the
future we are going to see a substantial number
of people passed through the court system
shackled, gagged, in glass booths with one-way
microphones, or simply being tried in
abstentia."
For many lawyers and laymen alike, these
subduing techniques are subjects of bitter
controversy. Many feel, as Professor Amsterdam
described, "that these methods of suppression in
the courtroom only give physical attention to

the repression that has been present in the
courts all along."
Disagreement
Other lawyers, however, disagree with this
repressive interpretation of the recent
courtroom proceedings. Philip Kurland, editor
of the Supreme Court Review defended the right
of the judge to control the actions of a
defendant saying "the courts are the last means
by which America can choose peace and reason
over force and violence to resolve some of the
domestic crises that rock us."
Professor Friedenthal added, "When a
defendant tries to make a travesty of the court
system and a judge takes action to prevent such
a disaster, he actually enhances the system."
"Most people are pretty damn fair," he
continued, "and if they see some jackass is
trying to screw the system, the people will
suddenly realize that the system operates rather
well and isn't operating repressively."
Whether the means a judge uses to maintain
order in the courtroom are repressive or not, the
recently used tactics do put the court into the
middle of the raging political controversies of
the day.
An examination of the FBl's list of most

wanted fugitives reveals that 9 of the top 16
most wanted men in the US are what could be
described as political criminals, wanted for
either conspiracy or terrorist activity. When
these defendants are brought to the courtroom
the essentially dispute-settling mechanism of the
courts take on the role of a stage for political
debate.
Revolutionary View
"From a revolutionary point of view,"
Professor Amsterdam explained, "the court is a
focal point of politicalization in the community.
Many people have lost faith in the system, and
conclude that if they can't get justice in the
courts, then why submit to it'?"
Most observers agree, however, that the
courts are largely incapable of changing the
politics of America."It isn't the courts that
make the system repressive," Professor
Friedenthal claimed, "because the courts can't
make laws.
Amsterdam concurred.. 'Courts are never
simply an extension of the temper of the
legislature, " he said, "because they can't refuse
to obey laws or change laws."
"To take one part of the system out and
attack it is unfair," he continued. • "It's like

telling the dog catcher he can't impound dogs.
Maybe the system itself shouldn't impound
dogs, but that's not the fault of the dog
catcher."
Caliber of Judges
The most serious shortcoming of the Judical
System today, the two law professors noted, is
the caliber of the judges in the system. "The
overwhelming percentage of judges are slanted
to prosecution and police interest," Amsterdam
said, "They remember the friendly face of the
school-crossing policeman, and don't tend to
empathize with minority groups."
Mr.. Kurland of the Supreme Court Review
added, "whether elected or appointed, the great
majority of American judges have their posts
because—and only because—of prior services
rendered to the dominant political party."
Professor Friedenthal said, "The courts can
point the way to solving the problems of this
country by the sentences they set or don't set. I
think it is very important that we use the best
possible methods to select good judges and retire
those who are bad."
Even good judges will probably not quell the
controversy over the court system in the United
States however. Judges cannot decide the
question that many courtroom distuptors hold
to be essential; the question of whether or not
the courts in this country are a legitimate means
of settling disputes and administering justice to
those who do not want to be a part of that
system.
