# power to what?
## Clarify Yourselves

I have two queries for He, who
would cast the first stone; He,
who is the obvious paragon of
virtue, wisdom, and just plain
goodness; He who is a Professor,
and thus, o f course, must have all
of the Answers; He, who is but
one of the downtroden and
destitute masses; He, who will
reach out in His rightousness and
glory and smite the wicked; that
great Leader of men (preferably in
large quantity), The Bruce.

" . .. Stanford University, which
designs much of the strategy and
weapons of the war against the
peoples of Southeast Asia . . .
Since I sincerely believe that this
University should not be involved
in such work, and that such works
should be widely publicized, I ask
that the author of that article
furnish the specific titles of each
such project, the names of the
Stanford University professors
and employees who are working
on each such specific project, and
at least a brief and explicit
description of each project and its
goals. Certainly the writer of the
article must have such factual
information to back his assertion,
for, otherwise, such a statement
must, at best, be classified as
irresponsible rumormongering,
and, at worst, identical to the

shaded half-truthes and outright,
propagandizing lies which so
many of us find so despicable in
the utterings "of Nixon, Agnew,
Laird, and Lodge.
My second query is a request
for the identifying characteristics
of "the people" that the "Power"
is "to". I have heard the cliche',
paraphrased by Nixon, "All power
to the people", however, though I
listened carefully and often, I
have not yet heard, "Power to all
the people". And, after the Lodge
shutdown, it is obvious that only
certain "people" are to have the
power (i.e., the majority of
"people" who were in the
auditorium to hear and perhaps
question Lodge were not the same
as the "people" referenced in the
above mentioned slogan).
In .this era of vague,
meaningless, and often
hypocritical slogans (such as, "far
out", "The Great Society",
"Vietnamization", and "separate
but equal"), it seems that "power
to the people" must be explained
and defined (what powers, which
people) if it is to be any more
than a mindless (and bodyless)
chant of a modern-day Holy
Roller demagogue. Otherwise, the
leader who chants it, and the
chorus who parrots it must be in
the same class as the Nixon-leader
and the Laird-Rogers-Lodge

chorus who parrot
"Vietnamization", and similar
vague and hypocritical mouthings.
For "All power to the people" to
have meaning to me, and perhaps
even have my agreement, I wish to
know which "people" will have the
power (will be the
philosopher-kings), and which
ones (such as the Lodge listeners)
will be the slaves, without "the
power".
Though this contains more
barbs than Berkeley, and possibly
even more sarcasm than the
DAILY article which instigated it,
I am quite serious in requesting
that these questions be answered.
The Pacific Studies Center and the
New Left Project have been
investigating Stanford's liasion
with the DoD and war research;
when their report comes out, I
think it should be published, at
least in synopsis form, in the
DAILY. So to speak, put up or
shut up. As for "Power to the
people", I agree with it at face
value. But when its equated with
some people forcing other people
into subservience, then it becomes
both objectionable and verbal
chaos. I don't like a gun held to
my head; neither by a Nixonite
nor a Maoist.

I have two queries for He, who

who is the obvious paragon of
virtue, wisdom, and just plain
goodness; He who is a Professor,

of the Answers; He, who is but

destitute masses; He, who will

designs much of the strategy and

peoples of Southeast Asia . . .
Since I sincerely believe that this
University should not be involved
in such work, and that such works
should be widely publicized, I ask
that the author of that article
furnish the specific titles of each
such project, the names of the
Stanford University professors
and employees who are working
on each such specific project, and
at least a brief and explicit
description of each project and its

article must have such factual
information to back his assertion,
for, otherwise, such a statement
must, at best, be classified as
irresponsible rumormongering,

shaded half-truthes and outright,
propagandizing lies which so
many of us find so despicable in
the utterings "of Nixon, Agnew,
Laird, and Lodge.
My second query is a request
for the identifying characteristics
of "the people" that the "Power"
is "to". I have heard the cliche',
paraphrased by Nixon, "All power
to the people", however, though I
listened carefully and often, I
have not yet heard, "Power to all
the people". And, after the Lodge
shutdown, it is obvious that only
certain "people" are to have the
power (i.e., the majority of
"people" who were in the
auditorium to hear and perhaps
question Lodge were not the same
as the "people" referenced in the
above mentioned slogan).
In .this era of vague,
meaningless, and often
hypocritical slogans (such as, "far
out", "The Great Society",
"Vietnamization", and "separate
but equal"), it seems that "power
to the people" must be explained
and defined (what powers, which
people) if it is to be any more
than a mindless (and bodyless)
chant of a modern-day Holy
Roller demagogue. Otherwise, the
leader who chants it, and the
chorus who parrots it must be in
the same class as the Nixon-leader
and the Laird-Rogers-Lodge

chorus who parrot
"Vietnamization", and similar
vague and hypocritical mouthings.
For "All power to the people" to
have meaning to me, and perhaps
even have my agreement, I wish to
know which "people" will have the
power (will be the
philosopher-kings), and which
ones (such as the Lodge listeners)
will be the slaves, without "the
power".
Though this contains more
barbs than Berkeley, and possibly
even more sarcasm than the
DAILY article which instigated it,
I am quite serious in requesting
that these questions be answered.
The Pacific Studies Center and the
New Left Project have been
investigating Stanford's liasion
with the DoD and war research;
when their report comes out, I
think it should be published, at
least in synopsis form, in the

shut up. As for "Power to the
people", I agree with it at face
value. But when its equated with
some people forcing other people
into subservience, then it becomes
both objectionable and verbal
chaos. I don't like a gun held to
my head; neither by a Nixonite
nor a Maoist.
