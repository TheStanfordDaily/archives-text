Nixon Secrecy Blasted
WASHINGTON — Some leading Democratic senators
blasted the Nixon administration for secrecy surrounding
Vietnamese operations yesterday, while other denounced
the U.S.backed South Vietnamese drive into Cambodia as
a new escalation of the war.
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield of Montana and his
deputy, Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, criticized
the secrecy surrounding operations near the Loatian
border.
Mansfield, talking with reporters, said the continuing
secrecy "is creating a very difficult situation and a certain
amount of apprehension of what is in the offing.
"I dislike getting my information from the Russians, the
French and the Japanese," he said, referring to foreign
press reports of a U.S.-backed South Vietnamese strike at
Communist supply bases in southern Laos.
Byrd, the new assistant Democratic leader, accused the
administration of "inexcusable bungling" in blocking
information on the operation from Congress and the
people.
Cease—Fire Prolonged
CAIRO — Egypt has agreed provisionally to extend the
Middle East cease-fire until March 5, a Cairo broadcast said
yesterday night.
The oroadcast, heard in Washington, did not spell out
conditions for the one-month extension.
While the decision was being taken in Cairo, military
sources in Tel Aviv said Egyptian warplanes flew over
Israeli military positions along the Suez Canal for the third
time in as many days.
Tass Gives News
LAOS — The Communist side provided fresh but vague
reports yesterday on the allied action that apparently has
reached inside Laos or centers on the frontier of that
nominally neutral country. The allies continued their
blackout on news of what was or was not going on.
The Soviet Union, mentioning the situation for the

third day, said it "strongly denounces the armed intrusion
of the United States and Saigon puppets into Laos."
The Pathet Lao, the Communist movement in Laos, did
not go that far. It broadcast that U.S. and South
Vietnamese troups were massing on the South Vietnamese
border for a major operation in Laos.
Yesterday the Soviet agency Tass carried a statement
saying, "United States ruling circles. . .are completely
responsible for further aggravation of the situation in Laos
and entire Indochina.
"The situation in Indochina has greatly aggravated in
recent days," Tass asserted. "Reports say that a
considerable number of Saigon ground troops supported
by U.S. armed forces invaded Laos. U.S. planes every day
make massed raids on the territory of Laos. Heavy
bombers, B5 2s, take part in these raids."
Induction Center Bombed
OAKLAND, Calif. — A bomb went off early today at
the Oakland Army Induction Center, for years the target
of protests against U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia.
An Oakland police spokesman said the blast took place
a little past 12:30 a.m., either in front of or in the
building.
There were no immediate reports of any injuries. All
available police and fire units were dispatched to the scene.
U.S. Aids Election
SAIGON — U.S. trained research squads are using national
surveys of Vietnamese public opinion to assist President
Nguyen Van Thieu in his campaign for re-election this
year.
The monthly surveys which are prepared and analyzed
by American officials here include specific questions
concerning Thieu's own political appeal, the popularity of
his political rivals, and those issues that most concern the
Vietnamese people.
Known as the Pacification Attitude Analysis System,
the alledged purpose of the survey is to measure trends in
rural opinion and the reaction of Vietnamese citizens to
specific events.
