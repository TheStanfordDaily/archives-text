# Arson Blamed For Temple Fire
## 
### 
An investigation of the fire which
gutted the Masonic Temple on
University Avenue last Friday is now in
progress. Palo Alto Fire Inspector
Robert Cleveland has stated that the
fire was definitely set by
someone. "We have evidence that it
was arson. We've just about eliminated
the possibility of anything else,"
Cleveland said, Tuesday.
He would not elaborate on the
nature of the evidence, but he did
report that some peculiar "burn

patterns" were discovered in an area off
the main meeting room.
All evidence pointing to arson is
apparently physical, according to
Cleveland. He added that there was no
evidence suggesting that the fire was set
for political reasons or by someone
having a grudge against the
organizations using the building.
The blaze, which started Friday
afternoon, did an estimated $500,000
damage to the three-story building in
the downtown Palo Alto area.
