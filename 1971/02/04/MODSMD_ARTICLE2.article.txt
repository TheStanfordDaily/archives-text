SAIGON (AP) â€” Twenty thousand South Vietnamese troops were massed in
the northwest corner of South Vietnam today, possibly for a thrust into
Laos, as 1 0,000 other Saigon troops pressed a new drive into Cambodia west
and northwest of Saigon.
Despite reports circulating in Washington and other world capitals that
South Vietnamese forces already had crossed into Laos, there was no
confirmation of this from military spokesmen.
Backing up the South Vietnamese, some 9,000 U.S. ground troops were on
the hunt for enemy supply buildups and infiltration routes in the northern
quarter of South Vietnam. Only minor contacts were reported in the first
days of the drive, with less than half a dozen North Vietnamese killed and
three Americans wounded.
It all added up to one of the biggest campaigns of the Indochina war, with
nearly 40,000 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops involved, plus the full
weight of American air power in Southeast Asia.
Details of the widespread offensive became clear as the U.S. Command
today lifted a six-day news blackout on the operations in South Vietnam's
northernmost provinces, including reopening of the abandoned U.S. Marine
combat base at Khe Sanh.
In a possibly related development, Communist China's official news
agency has told all newspapers in China to suspend publication temporarily, a
most unusual order that could portend a major development.
Among the possibilities mentioned were the death of Chairman Mao
Tse-tung, a new Chinese move in the Indochina war and the start of the
long-awaited 4 th National People's Congress.
