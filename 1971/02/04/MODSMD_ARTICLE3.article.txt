# Charter, Chairman: Center Of Turmoil Surrounding SJC Disruption Hearings
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
is a pre-mature and mal-formed baby. It
was frantically produced during a
4 8-hour period in the Spring of 1968,
and in the words of one law professor,
"we got exactly what we deserved."
The professor, who requested that
his name be withheld from publication,
termed the SJC charter "almost
impossible" and criticized the
ill-defined role of the SJC chairman.
"To say that the chairman rules on
the relevance of evidence and what
kind of challenges can be made is a very
poor statement indeed."
Since last Friday's hearing, in which
four SJC defendants were held in
contempt by current chairman Howard
Williams, there has been widespread
debate over the origin and extent of the
chairman's contempt powers.
Although these powers, which
enable the chairman to find anyone in
contempt and recommend a course of
action to the president, are not
specifically enumerated in the SJC
charter, the professor maintains that
they are "necessarily implicit."
Before Williams accepted President
Lyman's appointment to the
chairmanship of SJC, he, the Council,
and Lyman decided that the power of
contempt rested with the chairman.
No Bailiff
"The chairman does not have a
bailiff," the law professor explained,
"he can't physically quell a disruption.
So if he can't hold those who choose to

disrupt a hearing in contempt, what can
he do?
"The power of summary contempt
is chiefly designed to expedite the
proceeding," he continued. "If the
contempt sentences were levied after
the hearing was completed, they would
in no way expedite the hearing. The
key is in the hands of the
defendants—they can take themselves
off of suspension if they get the hearing
over with."
In reference to last Friday's session,
the professor said that the defendants'
conduct "can't help but effect the trier
of fact." He added that Williams would
be forced to lean over backwards on
behalf of the defendants to offset any
prejudice that might have resulted from
Friday's session.
The SJC is not Williams' first
venture into the university judiciary. A
law school professor, he also chaired
the controversial Interim Judicial Body
(IJB), an all faculty appellate body of
the now defunct Student Judicial
Council
Controversial IJB
The IJB was at the center of
controversy in 1968, and sparked the
first Old Union sit-in in May of that
year, when it overruled a unanimous
decision by the Student Judicial
Council to acquit six students who
were cited for university violations
during a November demonstration
against the CIA'
At the request of the then-Dean of
Students, Joel Smith, who was

dissatisfied with the student judiciar>'s
verdict, the IJB agreed to review the
case.
"The crucial mistake," recalled
former Daily editor Phil Taubman,
"was that when the IJB found the six
students guilty and decided to suspend
them, chairman Williams informed the
Daily of its decision at the same time it
reached President Sterling.
"The next day, the Daily ran a story
on the IJB decisions, and Sterling had
no chance to deliberate over Williams'
recommendations. -•
'No Tactical Sense'
"Williams had no tactical sense at
all," Taubman continued. "The
incident became an issue, the students
were angry with Williams, and he was
pretty much discredited as the judicial
head on campus."
Hubert Marshall, professor of
political science, recalled another
oversight that damaged the prestige of
the IJB in the eyes of the students,
faculty, and even the administration.
"When the Student Judicial Council
handed down its acquittal decision, it
issued an elaborately long opinion that
must have taken a full page of the
Daily. I read it carefully at least ten
times. It was a beautifully done, but
fallacious political document.
"The average student or faculty
member—one not versed in
constitutional law—might have been
impressed.
"But," he continued, "I have never
seen an opinion issued by the IJB after
it overturned the student judiciary's
decision. Howie Williams let the
administration down very badly
because only one side, the student side,
was heard. The administration is
continually being out-foxed. It never
comes to its own defense."
Unrepresentative for Faculty?
Marshall also asserted that the IJB
was perceived by the faculty to be
unrepresentative of faculty views. "The
IJB and Williams were thought to be
hawkish, harsh and quite conservative.
The present SJC has a degree of
legitimacy in the eyes of the faculty
that the IJB didn't have.
When he learned of Williams'
appointment to chair the 19 70-71 SJC,
Marshall admitted that he was

somewhat surprised. "But whe I looked
into it, and realized that the chairman
had to be a member of the law school
faculty—a group of 30 men—and that
two had already served, I became more
aware of the difficulty of choosing a
man.
"I know for a fact that one eligible
candidate threatened to leave Stanford
if he was appointed. I also know that it
took a great deal of arm-twisting to get
Williams to take the job.
"At one point," concluded Marshall,
"some people seriously considered
going to the student body to get them
to amend the SJC charter so that a
chairman could be chosen from outside
the law school. It was becoming a
desparate search to find the right kind
of man with the right kind of
temperment."
Williams Appointed Chairman
Williams has managed to survive the
barrage of University criticism, was
appointed the third chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council, and is
currently embroiled in another
controversy, involving another alleged
student disruption.
"The process would have been much

"RACE TO OBLIVION"-- Director of the Stanford Linear Accelerator, Wolfgang
Panofsky, spoke about the dangers of the strategic arms race last night in a speech
at Bishop Auditorium. The advisor to the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency

the strategic standoff between the US and the USSR.
simpler, and the breaches in orderly
conduct would probably not have
occurred," one law professor said of
Friday's hearing, "if there had been
genuine lawyers representing the
defendants."
But he refused to endorse a policy
that would require the University,
which already employs a prosecuting
attorney, to provide the defendants
with a public defender.
"Due process means something
different here than in a court of law.
To my knowledge there is not a case in
the history of the SJC which required a
defendant to be given an attorney.
Should Have Counsel
"I would encourage them (the
defendants) to get counsel," he
continued, "because a defendant can't
be objective about his own case."
The professor cited criticism of
Williams for not explaining courtroom
procedure to the defendants and their
student counselors. But he defended
Williams, saving, "the SJC is not a
court; it's an administrative tribunal.
They (the Council) play it pretty loose
and are not bound by the technical
rules of law.
"The defendants are represented by
five counsel who Williams has known in
the past," the professor added, "and
nothing he did on Friday should have
surprised them."
He rebuffed defense counsel H.
Bruce Franklin's charge that the terms
of the voir dire did not give the
defendants an adequate opportunity to
determine prejudice on the part of
members of the SJC.
In Any Other Court...
"The type of voir dire that the
defense conducted last Friday wouldn't

have been allowed in any other court.
The groundrules for the voir dire
(members of the SJC were polled as a
group, and were to be asked questions
that could be answered yes or no), were
established to prevent it from being
interminable. Williams also wanted to
protect the members of the Council,"
the professor explained.
"It was unfair to ask them to
articulate their philosophical views in
response to lengthy questions loaded
with words carrying a great emotive
character. The words 'fascism' and
'genocide' mean different things to
different people."
Last Monday, a Daily editorial
suggested the possibility of establishing
an all-student judicial system to balance
the current situation in which only
faculty members try faculty cases.
Although the professor conceded that
an all-student judiciary would be
satisfactory in some instances, he
warned that "in what is described as a
'political trial' the student judges would
be subject to severe peer-group
pressure.

"Students are only recently getting
involved with administrative power,"
he continued. "Campus discipline is
ultimately in the hands of the
President."
He also maintianed that the faculty
contingent of the SJC has a basic
understanding of the prevalent student
attitudes on Vietnam. "If you don't
think they're affected by these and
other attitudes, you're wrong.
"The SJC places considerable weight
on what moves an individual to do
what he does." Consequently, the
professor said, "it can be determined
that a defendant has violated a
University policy, but on the basis of
an optional motivational statement,
which is not subject to
cross-examination, it is not inconsistent
for the SJC to decide against punishing
him."
The professor noted that this type
of system places the inarticulate
defendants at a disadvantage, but he
pointed out that the seven Lodge
defendants "are very articulate
people."
