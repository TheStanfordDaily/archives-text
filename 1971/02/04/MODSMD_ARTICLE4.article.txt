# Library Worker Demands Revocation Of Suspension
## 
### PHIL LIND 
John Keiich, a young Main Library
employee suspended from work for
allegedly disrupting Ambassador
Lodge's speech Jan. 11, tacked a
statement demanding reinstatement to
the door of the President's office
following a rally on the Main Library
steps yesterday. The rally had drawn
over 100 worker* and students.
The statement read, "We want the
arbitrary action against John Keilch,
which was devised by top
administration officials, completely
rescinded by 12 noon on Friday, Feb.
5,1971.
"In addition, we want the
administration to make a complete
retraction of all wrongful policies in the
matter, which are a threat to all
University employees."
Keilch was suspended from his job
for three months and placed on a year's
probation.
The hour-long rally, sponsored by
United Stanford Employees (USK) and
the Main Library workers, included
speeches by Keilch and four other
campus workers. The first speaker was
Doris Youdelman, wife of suspended
English TA, Jeff Youdelman. She spoke
on the solidarity that exists among
Main Library workers.
Workers Co-operate
"In the last week we have learned
how people co-operate during struggles.
Pay is always low in the library and
workers have to put up with a lot of
intimidation. But this week has shown
that there are some things we will not

accept. There is almost unanimous
support for John," she said.
Professor H. Bruce Franklin has also
been cited in the Lodge disruption and
compared his case to that of Keilch's.
"John Keilch's case is more important
than mine because John is a worker and
has no privilages as do the university
professors. I am part of a privileged
class that has a lot of protection where
the workers do not.
"Even the professors want to see
John fired. Why do professors say that
yelling at a war criminal is an act of
violence, but that taking a man's
livelihood away is not an act of
violence?"
Use of 'Rhetoric'
Keilch, the last speaker, dealt with
the use of the rhetoric. "The
administration claims we are using mere
rhetoric when we try to express our
ideas and frustrations What we have
seen from Lyman and the
administration this last week has been
the rhetoric.
"If Lyman would distinguish himself
by coming to the defense of Bobby
Seale, David Milliard, and the rest of
the people who have never had freedom
of spwh then I might listen to Lyman
complain about Lodge's speech.
"People have told me that. 1
shouldn't relate my case to Southeast
Asia. I don't see how the two can be
separated. The same ruling clique that
is controlling my case is responsible for
controlling the lives of Southeast Asian
peoples."
The rally ended after about 100
people marched to Lyman's office with
the reinstatement demand.
