# Panofsky Warns Of Dangerous, Uncontrolled Strategic Arms Race
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
Linear Accelerator Director
Wolfgang Panofsky called for a halt to
the "race to oblivion" in a speech on
the strategic arms race last night in
Bishop Auditorium.
"Representatives of the U.S. and the
U.S.S.R. have sat down together about
5,000 times to discuss how to limit the
ever-increasing burden of armaments
and their inherent danger," he said.
"Yet the arms race has continued
unabated."
About 180 billion dollars, or 8 per
cent of the world's productivity, is
spent annually on armaments, resulting
in a nuclear stockpile with more than

ten tons equivalent of TNT explosive
power for every human on the globe,
Panofsky stated.
In light of the dangers posed by the
continuing escalation, he expressed
support of the adoption of significant
armament limitations through the
SALT talks. But he went on to warn
that the pursuit of arms control
agreements (such as SALT), if handled
poorly, could in itself accelerate the
arms race.
SALT Talks Cause Escalation
"The pursuit of these talks has
actually to some extent proved
escalatory in the arms race. Both sides
have apparently been persuaded to
push vigorously their strategic
weaponry while the talks are
progressing in order to be able to
negotiate from a 'position of
strength'," he said.
Panofsky identified the causes of the
arms race which make control
agreements difficult: misinformation
concerning the opponent's technical
status, misjudgment of his plans, and
mistrust jf his intent.
The missile race of the early 1 9 60's
and the development of the MIRV's or
independently guided multiple
warheads, are both seen by Panofsky as
results of inadequate knowledge by the
United States of Soviet capabilities and
plans.
The nuclear physicist blamed much
of the misjudgment and mistrust on the
ambiguity of U.S. and Soviet strategic
policies. Although most civilian leaders
on both sides see nuclear weapons
solely as deterrents to war, Panofsky
explained, military leaders often push
f->r "damage limitation" systems that
would allow them to "fight a war and
prevail." Such "damage limitation"
systems allow the destruction of enemy
missiles on the ground or l>efore they
reach their targets.

"The two strategic objectives,
deterrence and damage limitation, if
adopted by both the Soviet Union and
the U.S., effectively countermand one
another," stated Panofsky. "Thus the
arms race continues."
Panofsky exemplified this problem
by describing the effects of the MIRV
and ABM deployments, the MIRV's can
be designed to achieve varying degrees
of accuracy, the advisor to the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
explained. The least accurate systems,
he said, «ince they could only penetrate
a Soviet ABM system without
destroying Russian missile sites, would
act only as deterrents without posing a
threat of an aggressive American attack.
MIRV: First-Strike Threat?
On the other hand, Panofsky warned
that the accurate MIRV's now being
deployed, which can bo aimed at
Russian missile sites, could lead to fears
by the Russians that the U.S. is
developing a first-strike threat.
Discussing the ABM system, the
nuclear physicist pointed out that
further deployments might give rise to
"Soviet suspicions that the U.S. might
consider launching a first-strike attack
against the Soviet Union under cover of
its ABM to blunt a retaliatory strike."
Panofsky states that, "the actual
U.S. systems arc so ambiguous that a
Soviet military planner would be led to
fear the worst about our intent. . . .The
combination of ABM and MIRV is
particularly threatening to a stable
strategic stand-off between the two
great powers."
Panofsky referred to a Nixon
statement that negotiators may have to
settle for only partial limitations. But
the scientist expressed his hope that the
SALT proceedings will be directed
toward an eventual "major limitation
of most strategic weapons, both in
quantity and quality.
