## Right Of Free Speech 
### 
In lodging a protest by
protesting a Lodge, Bruce
Franklin and the others identified
as disrupters have been accused of
interfering with the right of free
expression of opinion. It seems to
me that several points have been
neglected in this discussion of
freedom of speech.
If, as the time-honored formula
has it, truth emerges from the free
exchange of ideas, then the
differences in power among those
taking part in the dialogue must
be considered irrelevant to the
discussion. Discussion is not the
same as decision-making, which is
a process in which power is
usually an important factor and
truth at best a side issue.
Here was Lodge, identified
with the hard line in Vietnam and
with cold-war policies. As the
writer of a recent letter to the
Chronicle asks, "How often does
one get a chance to confront a
person such as this, to break
through the protective barriers of
entourage and personally express
one's disapproval, especially in a
situation which had probably
been set up ... to maintain the
illusion of approval of his dignity
and position in American ruling
circles?"
The analogy of the market is
carried into conceptions of
freedom of expression; just as the
exchange relationship has been
used to mask realities of power so
has free speech masked the factor
of power (obviously the man who
owns the newspaper has
opportunities for expression
which are denied the rest of us.)
Protest Against Exclusion
Disruption may be seen as a
protest against exclusion from
participation in decision-making
processes, against the cavalier
disregard of the ordinary citizen
by the official: his reluctance or
refusal to meet in open discussion.
What meaning does a man's
freedom of expression have when
it is consistently ignored? It is
unfortunate, but true, that
disruption and violence is all that
is heard.
It is not difficult to know
Lodge's sentiments on an issue; he
does not suffer from lack of a
podium. Other views have a more
difficult time. And it is the
university's particular
responsibility to ensure that
unpopular opinions be heard.
In recent years there has been
reasoning, discussion and debate,
petitioning and peaceful
marching, here and throughout
the nation. And when nothing
happens, then the inevitable
disruption on the part of those
who feel strongly (perhaps feel
also that constitutional guarantees
are rapidly diminishing), those
appalled by the horrors of actions
committed in their name and
perceptive enough to see that the
war is not being "wound down."
"I believe that many of us
prefer to remain aloof, to remain
bystanders, and therefore it is
necessary to excuse our passivity
by labeling student and other
leftists "nihilist/' or to see them
as wrongheaded in their choice of
tactics, or to avoid the meaning of
an action by introducing the free
speech issue.
Little, Secure World
Our little world is so basically
secure and orderly that almost
any departure from the rules is
magnified into an issue. Veblen,

one of the more distinguished ol
those professors invited to leave
Stanford (perhaps a sort of Bruce
Franklin in his day), one
remarked that the intellectual
horizon of professors is limited by
the same commonplace insights
and preconceptions that
characterize the conservative
middle class. That may be less
true of our own time, but I think
we are the captives of
developments which make it
increasingly difficult to develop
moral sensitivity.
Decisions leading to mass
annihilation involve so many
intervening stages and fragmented
actions and different agencies that
it is hard to comprehend a process
as a whole and hard to locate
responsibility. Considerations of
ought are reduced to correct
strategies. By virtue of their
monstrosity it may even be that
offenses which reach beyond our
imaginations are committed more
easily, for when consequences can
be calculated our inhibitions are
more apt to operate.
Imaginative Capacity Atrophied
Our capacity for action has
outgrown moral and emotional
and imaginative capacities. I get
the strong impression that Bruce
is condemned because many on
this campus do not consider
Lodge a war criminal. And this
may, at least in part, be explained
as a failure of moral imagination.
I admit that some who feel
strongly are guilty of a kind of
moral arrogance; this letter may
reveal some of my own. But I find
it almost incomprehensible that so
few of us are willing to see that,
first, every "right" is an
application of the same measure
to different people who are not in

Little, Secure World
Our little world is so basically
secure and orderly that almost
any departure from the rules is
magnified into an issue. Veblen,

one of the more distinguished ol
those professors invited to leave
Stanford (perhaps a sort of Bruce
Franklin in his day), one
remarked that the intellectual
horizon of professors is limited by
the same commonplace insights
and preconceptions that
characterize the conservative
middle class. That may be less
true of our own time, but I think
we are the captives of
developments which make it
increasingly difficult to develop
moral sensitivity.
Decisions leading to mass
annihilation involve so many
intervening stages and fragmented
actions and different agencies that
it is hard to comprehend a process
as a whole and hard to locate
responsibility. Considerations of
ought are reduced to correct
strategies. By virtue of their
monstrosity it may even be that
offenses which reach beyond our
imaginations are committed more
easily, for when consequences can
be calculated our inhibitions are
more apt to operate.
Imaginative Capacity Atrophied
Our capacity for action has
outgrown moral and emotional
and imaginative capacities. I get
the strong impression that Bruce
is condemned because many on
this campus do not consider
Lodge a war criminal. And this
may, at least in part, be explained
as a failure of moral imagination.
I admit that some who feel
strongly are guilty of a kind of
moral arrogance; this letter may
reveal some of my own. But I find
it almost incomprehensible that so

In lodging a protest by
protesting a Lodge, Bruce
Franklin and the others identified
as disrupters have been accused of
interfering with the right of free
expression of opinion. It seems to
me that several points have been
neglected in this discussion of
freedom of speech.
If, as the time-honored formula
has it, truth emerges from the free
exchange of ideas, then the
differences in power among those
taking part in the dialogue must
be considered irrelevant to the
discussion. Discussion is not the
same as decision-making, which is
a process in which power is
usually an important factor and
truth at best a side issue.
Here was Lodge, identified
with the hard line in Vietnam and
with cold-war policies. As the
writer of a recent letter to the
Chronicle asks, "How often does
one get a chance to confront a
person such as this, to break
through the protective barriers of
entourage and personally express
one's disapproval, especially in a
situation which had probably
been set up ... to maintain the
illusion of approval of his dignity
and position in American ruling
circles?"
The analogy of the market is
carried into conceptions of
freedom of expression; just as the
exchange relationship has been
used to mask realities of power so
has free speech masked the factor
of power (obviously the man who
owns the newspaper has
opportunities for expression
which are denied the rest of us.)
Protest Against Exclusion
Disruption may be seen as a
protest against exclusion from
participation in decision-making
processes, against the cavalier
disregard of the ordinary citizen
by the official: his reluctance or
refusal to meet in open discussion.
What meaning does a man's
freedom of expression have when
it is consistently ignored? It is
unfortunate, but true, that
disruption and violence is all that
is heard.

Imaginative Capacity Atrophied
Our capacity for action has

is condemned because many on

Lodge a war criminal. And this
may, at least in part, be explained
as a failure of moral imagination.
I admit that some who feel
strongly are guilty of a kind of
moral arrogance; this letter may

Portion of Vietnam we sponsor -
where there is now an increasing
demand for political change (a
' demand which we aren't allowed
[ to hear much about).
Demonstrations are not tolerated,

publish, thousand of political
prisoners are imprisoned in
miserable jails and camps. And
this weekend the effort to reduce
southern Laos to a crater was
escalated.
We should all be in Washington
insisting on our freedom to be
heard (and, more important, to be
answered). Any teach-in arranged
on this campus should be
attended especially by those who
make much of the importance of
free discussion.
Bruce Franklin, representing
ideas that are rare enough around
here, should be allowed to
continue his teaching, or, if
suspended, should be hired by the
Hoover Institution to pursue
further his research and analysis -
a necessary corrective to the
rather one-sided view of things
from that tower beyond tragedy.
(Charles Drekmeier is a
professor of political science.)
In lodging a protest by
protesting a Lodge, Bruce
Franklin and the others identified
as disrupters have been accused of
interfering with the right of free
expression of opinion. It seems to
me that several points have been
neglected in this discussion of
freedom of speech.
If, as the time-honored formula
has it, truth emerges from the free
exchange of ideas, then the
differences in power among those
taking part in the dialogue must
be considered irrelevant to the
discussion. Discussion is not the
same as decision-making, which is
a process in which power is
usually an important factor and
truth at best a side issue.
Here was Lodge, identified
with the hard line in Vietnam and
with cold-war policies. As the
writer of a recent letter to the
Chronicle asks, "How often does
one get a chance to confront a
person such as this, to break
through the protective barriers of
entourage and personally express
one's disapproval, especially in a
situation which had probably
been set up ... to maintain the
illusion of approval of his dignity
and position in American ruling
circles?"
The analogy of the market is
carried into conceptions of
freedom of expression; just as the
exchange relationship has been
used to mask realities of power so
has free speech masked the factor
of power (obviously the man who
owns the newspaper has
opportunities for expression
which are denied the rest of us.)
Protest Against Exclusion
Disruption may be seen as a
protest against exclusion from
participation in decision-making
processes, against the cavalier
disregard of the ordinary citizen
by the official: his reluctance or
refusal to meet in open discussion.
What meaning does a man's
freedom of expression have when
it is consistently ignored? It is
unfortunate, but true, that
disruption and violence is all that
is heard.
It is not difficult to know
Lodge's sentiments on an issue; he
does not suffer from lack of a
podium. Other views have a more
difficult time. And it is the
university's particular
responsibility to ensure that
unpopular opinions be heard.
In recent years there has been
reasoning, discussion and debate,
petitioning and peaceful
marching, here and throughout
the nation. And when nothing
happens, then the inevitable
disruption on the part of those
who feel strongly (perhaps feel
also that constitutional guarantees
are rapidly diminishing), those
appalled by the horrors of actions
committed in their name and
perceptive enough to see that the
war is not being "wound down."
"I believe that many of us
prefer to remain aloof, to remain
bystanders, and therefore it is
necessary to excuse our passivity
by labeling student and other
leftists "nihilist/' or to see them
as wrongheaded in their choice of
tactics, or to avoid the meaning of
an action by introducing the free
speech issue.
Little, Secure World
Our little world is so basically
secure and orderly that almost
any departure from the rules is
magnified into an issue. Veblen,

one of the more distinguished ol
those professors invited to leave
Stanford (perhaps a sort of Bruce
Franklin in his day), one
remarked that the intellectual
horizon of professors is limited by
the same commonplace insights
and preconceptions that
characterize the conservative
middle class. That may be less
true of our own time, but I think
we are the captives of
developments which make it
increasingly difficult to develop
moral sensitivity.
Decisions leading to mass
annihilation involve so many
intervening stages and fragmented
actions and different agencies that
it is hard to comprehend a process
as a whole and hard to locate
responsibility. Considerations of
ought are reduced to correct
strategies. By virtue of their
monstrosity it may even be that
offenses which reach beyond our
imaginations are committed more
easily, for when consequences can
be calculated our inhibitions are
more apt to operate.
