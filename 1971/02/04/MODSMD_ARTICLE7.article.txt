justice second
Editor, THE DAILY:
After analyzing Visiting Prof.
Harold L. Segal's comments in the
Feb. 2 issue of The Stanford
Daily, I find what he is actually
saying is this: membership in any
Establishment automatically strips
an individual of the right to
defend himself against accusations
made against him.
Most people belong to some
kind of Establishment. Many of
them offend my social conscience.
Since action is primary and justice
is secondary, I can now go out
and stone them. Thank you, Prof.
Segal.

treason complaint
Editor, THE DAILY:
You have done a great
disservice to the nation in your
article of Feb. 3, in reporting on
the invasion of Laos by the U.S.
and its allies. The Department of
Defense has obviously decided
that this news should not be
disseminated on the domestic
front; there is sure to be a good
reason for this. Your reprinting of
foreign reports without prior
approval therefore borders on
treason. How can the nation be
mobilized for war when the
propaganda machine is so weak?
The Nixon administration appears

pallid in comparison with
historical examples. They would
never have let you print that in
Germany in Hitler's time. They
understood the importance of
complete news control. If we
must have totalitarian
government, let's have an efficient
one.

fair professor
Editor, THE DAILY:
It has been alleged that Bruce
Franklin's conduct at the Lodge
appearance contradicts the notion
of the University as an open
forum for the free exchange of
ideas and thus substantially
impairs the performance of his
functions within the University
community. I have no firsthand
knowledge of the Lodge incident,
but I do sometimes attend Bruce's
classes and can say something
about his performance as a
teacher which may be relevant to
the allegation. Though I often
profoundly disagree with his
views, I believe I have a strong
obligation to report that no
professor could be more
scrupulous about the right of free
speech in a course or more serious
about making his classroom an
open forum than he. Franklin tells
his students that if they ever have
questions, objections, or points of
view which conflict with his own,
they have not only the
opportunity, but the duty to

express them. He solicits differing
opinions and criticism of any of
all aspects of his course, and he
makes it clear that anyone in the
community is free to come to his
classes and participate. It is simply
a fact that there has been a
greater possibility for a free
exchange of ideas in the classes of
his that I've seen, than in most
classes I've taken, heard of, or-to
be candid-taught.

staff revolt
Editor, THE DAILY:
I wish to protest the arbitrary
assignment of press card numbers
released today. The absurd
hierarchy of numbers evident in
this move is a fine example of the
type of fascist bureacratic
thinking you, Miss Double-fl
profess to abhor in your
pseudo-egalitarian salary stand.
How come Marshall, Bill, and
Margi never needed any numbers?
Huh? Huh? I ask you?
Until you publicly apologize
for this atrocity, which has
embarassed junior and senior
staffers alike, regardless of the
all-important pecking-order
number, I shall not reveal my troo
identitee.
LOYAL & TRUE OF THE
STANFORD DAILY (L&TOTSD)
P.S. Staff members are
planning a press card burning at
the Daily lunch next Tuesday.
