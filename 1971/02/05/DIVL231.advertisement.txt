Today In The 'Daily'
Today is a good day for birthdays. Not only was California's
own Chairman Ronald born on this date, but he has the honor
of sharing his birthdate with perhaps the most unliberated
woman of the decade - Zsa Zsa Gabor.
And, fittingly, we dedicate this issue of this with-it
newspaper to one Carmen Hansen, our bookkeeper for these
many years.
If there's anything you want to sell, our business office is
still very willing to take it, even if Carmen isn't there to tote it
up. Call 327-4150.
If you have an OATQ announcement or other important
news, tell it to our news office, x4632.
