# Campus Crime Increases
## 
### ALISON DAVIS 
There has been a tremendous
increase in violent crime across the
country in recent years, at least partly
reflected by the popularity of "law and
order" political speeches. According to
statistics, crime on campus is part of
the national trend.
Stanford is by no means immune to
the crime problem. From 1 969 to 1 970
incidents of malicious mischief went up
from 66 to 8 3 (partly due to trashing
last spring); battery from 13 to 23; rape
from 3 to 5; and robbery (usually
armed) from 1 to 9. Last month alone
the community lost $1 7,577 worth of
property in burglary and grand theft.
There is one area of crime in which
Stanford is atypical. The chief of
campus police at Cal State L.A.
estimated that indecent exposure
incidents on his campus had risen 75 to
100 per cent since 1 967. Other
campuses report similar trends.
Incidents of indecent exposure here
decreased from 25 in 1969 to 5 in
1 970.
Reasons
There are a number of standard
reasons offered to account for the
apparent increase in campus crime,
most of which can be applied to

Stanford: a rising national tendency
toward violent crime, larger student
populations, changing communities
surrounding the campus, and better
crime reporting.
William Beal, coordinator of police
services for the nine University of
California campuses and operational
chief for UC Berkeley, has another
explanation which might be applicable
here:
"Colleges and universities are
shifting their emphasis from their
traditional roles as educational
institutions to social and political
participators in the larger community.
In the context of the whole picture it
may be very necessary. But part of the
price that is paid is a higher crime rate.
. .As public educational
institutions become more and more
public places," he said, "they get more
and more the problems of public
places."
Open Campus
One of the factors contributing to
increased crime at Stanford, according
to Officer Wayne Warwick of th-~
campus police is an open dormatory
system and a much more open campus
in general. Today, with the elimination
of curfews and other similar

restrictions, there is much more
freedom of movement for students.
This means there is also more freedom
of movement for potential criminals.
This factor particularly affects the
incidence of the most common campus
crime: theft. "If you want to have an
open campus," said Warwick, "you
have to pay the price." The price last
year included $122,710 in grand theft
and burglary, and $33,373 in petty
theft, not to mention robbery and car
and bicycle thefts.
Warwick also cited student apathy as
being a problem in crime prevention on
campus. "Nobody seems to give a
damn."
Other important factors include the
physical layout of the campus and the
unusually high proportion of students,
faculty and staff that live on it.
"Stanford is the most unique university
in the state of California. What other
university has 30 miles of streets, 700
