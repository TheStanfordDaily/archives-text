# Campus Crime Increases
## 
### ALISON DAVIS 
There has been a tremendous
increase in violent crime across the
country in recent years, at least partly
reflected by the popularity of "law and
order" political speeches. According to
statistics, crime on campus is part of
the national trend.
Stanford is by no means immune to
the crime problem. From 1 969 to 1 970
incidents of malicious mischief went up
from 66 to 8 3 (partly due to trashing
last spring); battery from 13 to 23; rape
from 3 to 5; and robbery (usually
armed) from 1 to 9. Last month alone
the community lost $1 7,577 worth of
property in burglary and grand theft.
There is one area of crime in which
Stanford is atypical. The chief of
campus police at Cal State L.A.
estimated that indecent exposure
incidents on his campus had risen 75 to
100 per cent since 1 967. Other
campuses report similar trends.
Incidents of indecent exposure here
decreased from 25 in 1969 to 5 in
1 970.
Reasons
There are a number of standard
reasons offered to account for the
apparent increase in campus crime,
most of which can be applied to

Stanford: a rising national tendency
toward violent crime, larger student
populations, changing communities
surrounding the campus, and better
crime reporting.
William Beal, coordinator of police
services for the nine University of
California campuses and operational
chief for UC Berkeley, has another
explanation which might be applicable
here:
"Colleges and universities are
shifting their emphasis from their
traditional roles as educational
institutions to social and political
participators in the larger community.
In the context of the whole picture it
may be very necessary. But part of the
price that is paid is a higher crime rate.
. .As public educational
institutions become more and more
public places," he said, "they get more
and more the problems of public
places."
Open Campus
One of the factors contributing to
increased crime at Stanford, according
to Officer Wayne Warwick of th-~
campus police is an open dormatory
system and a much more open campus
in general. Today, with the elimination
of curfews and other similar

restrictions, there is much more
freedom of movement for students.
This means there is also more freedom
of movement for potential criminals.
This factor particularly affects the
incidence of the most common campus
crime: theft. "If you want to have an
open campus," said Warwick, "you
have to pay the price." The price last
year included $122,710 in grand theft
and burglary, and $33,373 in petty
theft, not to mention robbery and car
and bicycle thefts.
Warwick also cited student apathy as
being a problem in crime prevention on
campus. "Nobody seems to give a
damn."
Other important factors include the
physical layout of the campus and the
unusually high proportion of students,
faculty and staff that live on it.

in the state of California. What other
university has 30 miles of streets, 700

private family residences—not even
counting Frenchman's Hill—and 1000
apartment units'?" Very few universities
anywhere have that many private
residences on the campus itself. "This is
not a college campus," said Warwick,
"this is a small city."
Up until 1 967 everyone had
assumed that Stanford police had the
same powers as city police, more
technically known as "peace officers."
Campus police are not peace officers,
but have the same authority to arrest as
any citizen. In 1967, the University
sharply restricted the activities of
campus police, in accord with their
legal status. Warwick felt that this fact
helped explain the sudden increase in
violent crime after 1 967.
If campus police were to become
peace officers the University would lose
some of its control over them, so it
prefers to maintain the status quo.
According to Officer Warwick, police
here would prefer to be peace officers.
In reaction to the apparent increase
in crime, many schools across the
country are beginning to institute
increasingly tighter security measures.
At the University of South Carolina the

service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega
provides free taxi service for coeds who
prefer not to walk alone to the library
at night. A number of schools now
regularly check the identities of all
persons entering and leaving certain
buildings. The security chief at the
University of Florida is considering
sealing off little-used portions of the
campus al night and having a group of
buildings enclosed by a steel fence.
Stanford does not seem to be in
need of such stringent security

measures yet, although the University
has taken some steps in an attempt to
discourage campus crime: in many
places around the campus additional
lighting has been put in, and 12 to 15
security guards will be added to the
police force over the next few weeks.
According to Warwick, even
minimal student cooperation in helping
deter crime, i.e., locking rooms and cars
whenever possible, would help
eliminate the necessity to further
increase security measures on campus.

the community lost $1 7,577 worth of
property in burglary and grand theft.
There is one area of crime in which
Stanford is atypical. The chief of
campus police at Cal State L.A.
estimated that indecent exposure
incidents on his campus had risen 75 to
100 per cent since 1 967. Other
campuses report similar trends.
Incidents of indecent exposure here
decreased from 25 in 1969 to 5 in
1 970.
Reasons
There are a number of standard
reasons offered to account for the
apparent increase in campus crime,
most of which can be applied to

Stanford: a rising national tendency
toward violent crime, larger student
populations, changing communities
surrounding the campus, and better
crime reporting.
William Beal, coordinator of police
services for the nine University of
California campuses and operational
chief for UC Berkeley, has another
explanation which might be applicable
here:
"Colleges and universities are
shifting their emphasis from their
traditional roles as educational
institutions to social and political
participators in the larger community.
In the context of the whole picture it
may be very necessary. But part of the
price that is paid is a higher crime rate.
. .As public educational
institutions become more and more
public places," he said, "they get more
and more the problems of public
places."
Open Campus
One of the factors contributing to
increased crime at Stanford, according
to Officer Wayne Warwick of th-~
campus police is an open dormatory
system and a much more open campus
in general. Today, with the elimination
of curfews and other similar

restrictions, there is much more
freedom of movement for students.
This means there is also more freedom
of movement for potential criminals.
This factor particularly affects the
incidence of the most common campus
crime: theft. "If you want to have an
open campus," said Warwick, "you
have to pay the price." The price last
year included $122,710 in grand theft
and burglary, and $33,373 in petty
theft, not to mention robbery and car
and bicycle thefts.
Warwick also cited student apathy as
being a problem in crime prevention on
campus. "Nobody seems to give a
damn."
Other important factors include the
physical layout of the campus and the
unusually high proportion of students,
faculty and staff that live on it.

in the state of California. What other
university has 30 miles of streets, 700

private family residences—not even
counting Frenchman's Hill—and 1000
apartment units'?" Very few universities
anywhere have that many private
residences on the campus itself. "This is
not a college campus," said Warwick,
"this is a small city."
Up until 1 967 everyone had
assumed that Stanford police had the
same powers as city police, more
technically known as "peace officers."
Campus police are not peace officers,
but have the same authority to arrest as
any citizen. In 1967, the University
sharply restricted the activities of
campus police, in accord with their
legal status. Warwick felt that this fact
helped explain the sudden increase in
violent crime after 1 967.
If campus police were to become
peace officers the University would lose
some of its control over them, so it
prefers to maintain the status quo.
According to Officer Warwick, police
here would prefer to be peace officers.
In reaction to the apparent increase
in crime, many schools across the
country are beginning to institute
increasingly tighter security measures.
At the University of South Carolina the

service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega
provides free taxi service for coeds who
prefer not to walk alone to the library
at night. A number of schools now
regularly check the identities of all
persons entering and leaving certain
buildings. The security chief at the
University of Florida is considering
sealing off little-used portions of the
campus al night and having a group of
buildings enclosed by a steel fence.
Stanford does not seem to be in
need of such stringent security

measures yet, although the University
has taken some steps in an attempt to
discourage campus crime: in many
places around the campus additional
lighting has been put in, and 12 to 15
security guards will be added to the
police force over the next few weeks.
According to Warwick, even
minimal student cooperation in helping
deter crime, i.e., locking rooms and cars
whenever possible, would help
eliminate the necessity to further
increase security measures on campus.
There has been a tremendous
increase in violent crime across the
country in recent years, at least partly
reflected by the popularity of "law and
order" political speeches. According to
statistics, crime on campus is part of
the national trend.
Stanford is by no means immune to
the crime problem. From 1 969 to 1 970
incidents of malicious mischief went up
from 66 to 8 3 (partly due to trashing
last spring); battery from 13 to 23; rape
from 3 to 5; and robbery (usually
armed) from 1 to 9. Last month alone
the community lost $1 7,577 worth of
property in burglary and grand theft.

apparent increase in campus crime,
most of which can be applied to

Stanford: a rising national tendency
toward violent crime, larger student
populations, changing communities
surrounding the campus, and better
crime reporting.
William Beal, coordinator of police
services for the nine University of
California campuses and operational
chief for UC Berkeley, has another
explanation which might be applicable
here:
"Colleges and universities are
shifting their emphasis from their
traditional roles as educational
institutions to social and political
participators in the larger community.
In the context of the whole picture it
may be very necessary. But part of the
price that is paid is a higher crime rate.
. .As public educational
institutions become more and more
public places," he said, "they get more
and more the problems of public
places."
Open Campus
One of the factors contributing to
increased crime at Stanford, according
to Officer Wayne Warwick of th-~
campus police is an open dormatory
system and a much more open campus
in general. Today, with the elimination
of curfews and other similar

restrictions, there is much more
freedom of movement for students.
This means there is also more freedom
of movement for potential criminals.
This factor particularly affects the
incidence of the most common campus
crime: theft. "If you want to have an
open campus," said Warwick, "you
have to pay the price." The price last
year included $122,710 in grand theft
and burglary, and $33,373 in petty
theft, not to mention robbery and car
and bicycle thefts.
Warwick also cited student apathy as
being a problem in crime prevention on
campus. "Nobody seems to give a
damn."
Other important factors include the
physical layout of the campus and the
unusually high proportion of students,
faculty and staff that live on it.

in the state of California. What other
university has 30 miles of streets, 700

private family residences—not even
counting Frenchman's Hill—and 1000
apartment units'?" Very few universities
anywhere have that many private
residences on the campus itself. "This is
not a college campus," said Warwick,
"this is a small city."
Up until 1 967 everyone had
assumed that Stanford police had the
same powers as city police, more
technically known as "peace officers."
Campus police are not peace officers,
but have the same authority to arrest as
any citizen. In 1967, the University
sharply restricted the activities of
campus police, in accord with their
legal status. Warwick felt that this fact
helped explain the sudden increase in
violent crime after 1 967.
If campus police were to become
peace officers the University would lose
some of its control over them, so it
prefers to maintain the status quo.
According to Officer Warwick, police
here would prefer to be peace officers.
In reaction to the apparent increase
in crime, many schools across the
country are beginning to institute
increasingly tighter security measures.
At the University of South Carolina the

service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega
provides free taxi service for coeds who
prefer not to walk alone to the library
at night. A number of schools now
regularly check the identities of all
persons entering and leaving certain
buildings. The security chief at the
University of Florida is considering
sealing off little-used portions of the
campus al night and having a group of
buildings enclosed by a steel fence.
Stanford does not seem to be in
need of such stringent security

measures yet, although the University
has taken some steps in an attempt to
discourage campus crime: in many
places around the campus additional
lighting has been put in, and 12 to 15
security guards will be added to the
police force over the next few weeks.
According to Warwick, even
minimal student cooperation in helping
deter crime, i.e., locking rooms and cars
whenever possible, would help
eliminate the necessity to further
increase security measures on campus.
