# Report of the Ombudsman
## 
### 
Following the summer recess, the office of the University Ombudsman at
Stanford resumed its operations on October 1, 1970, at its new quarters
(Inner Quad, NIB, Fxt. 3628). Between then and the end of the fall quarter,
we dealt with 58 issues and grievances. The distribution of these cases in
terms of nature of contact, area of complaint, source of complaint, and
outcome, do not differ sufficiently from the pattern presented in the Annual
Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21, 19 7 0; Daily, October 23,
1970) to warrant detailed description. We shall therefore only briefly present
this information, but in addition, discuss in some detail one specific case with
certain features of general interest.
Of the 58 persons who came to see the Ombudsman, about half had a
specific grievance and the rest came for information and general assistance.
Although the figures involved are not large enough to permit definitive
conclusions, there was an apparent fall in the ratio of grievances (80 percent
last year) to other reasons for coming.
Students still constituted the majority of our clientele (64 percent) and
were equally divided between undergraduates and graduates. The percentage
of staff and faculty showed a slight increase over students (from 21 to 29
percent for stal l and 6 to 10 percent for faculty). In terms of outcome, in
aboui 40 percent of the cases we only provided information and advice. Only
about one in 10 persons was referred elsewhere, and we rejected only one in
10 grievances.
Of the 18 complaints we accepted as valid, we resolved 17. This does not
mean, of course, that in all cases the original grievance was necessarily settled
since in some instances the person, reconsidering the matter, voluntarily
withdrew his complaint or settled for a compromise resolution. At the end of
the term wc also had four cases pending.
Our purpose in presenting a case in detail, which we shall do next, is to
inform rather than to embarrass. Since many have asked me how the Om
budsman operates, this example will at least show what I did in a given case.
This presentation is. however, being made with' considerable misgivings.
Although the main parties to the conflict have consented to it, tiiis may still
be perceived as a breach of confidence since it will be relatively easy to
establish the identities of the persons involved.
More critical is the choice of example. We could conceivably have selected
a case to demonstrate a pointless University policy, a rigid administrative
practice, a self-seeking attitude by a faculty member, an unreasonable de
mand by a staff member, and any number of student sins. Why we selected
this example will probably invite a variety of interpretations. Our own
reasons for the choice are as follows: The grievance involved an employment
practice that had common features with other cases wc have seen and which
will permit certain generalizations. It attracted public interest and had con
siderable potential for esca'ating into a major conflict. Multiple and diverse
efforts went into its attempted resolution.
The story starts with a young man and a young woman, lie is the
supervisor: -a graduate student who has been instrumental in initiating the
snack wagon service on campus. The venture was less than a financial success
last year, but having extensively revised his operations, he had high hopes that
with a new person in charge the pioject will not financially vindicate itself.
The employee came f rom the Midwest, where she had worked for two years
operating a snack wagon on another campus. She was looking for a similar job
and was hired at the start of the quarter.
From here on the slory is confusing.
Her version is that she was working conscientiously and with good results,
even though she often disagreed with the supervisor. For instance, she was
told to promote sales more actively, while she felt people ought lo come to
hei. She would have preferred lo offer less in the way ol candy bars and more
items such as banana nut bread (which the supervisor says she proposed to
bake in hci < wn kitchen) and so on.

From here on, I can document my own activities but can present,only a
fragmentary picture of the efforts of others. I saw the employee on a
Thursday morning and by the following afternoon I had contacted the
supervisor, the manager, and the director individually and had a lengthy
conference with all three. I also had contacts with the fellow-employee, and
tried to keep the employee informed of my moves. Meanwhile, the friends of
the employee had held an open protest meeting on the premises and there
were intimations of additional and more vigorous public exercises. The
fellow-employee had also been meeting with the employee and the other
parties in the conflict.
There was enough ambiguity in the case to make me conclude that a
re-evaluation of the employee's suitability and reasonable trial period with
clear guidelines would be only fair. In the event she could not be given back
her job (the position having been filled meanwhile), I felt she would be
offered comparable employment.
The director, while correctly contesting the legal necessity for such re
consideration (the employee's still being in the probationary six-month peri
od), nevertheless agreed to give her the benefit of the doubt, and olfered her
another position with equal pay. Since the employee specifically wished to
operate the snack wagon, she turned down the offer of alternative employ
ment and preferred to drop the matter rather than to resort to additional
efforts of having herself reinstated in her old job.
What is one to make of all this? Were we dealing with an arbitrary and
heartless employment practice whereby a helpless woman was being victi
mized, or was this a tempest in a teapot caused by an incompetent employee
and her overeager defenders? Are radicals going around fomenting trouble or
are the minions of the Establishment sytematically harassing and oppressing
the people?
While there are many possible answers to these questions, the explanations
plausible to me revolve around the all too common frailties that complicate
human relationships as well as administrative practices which, vague enough
on paper, get foggier on implementation. While there are no ready remedies
His version is that soon after hiring her he became perturbed with her
performance she drove poorly, dressed poorly, took her dog along (but
stopped after being told that health officials would object), lounged around
on the grass, and all in all conducted her operations in a lackadaisical fashion.
Worse, she refused to conform to the supervisor's wishes and instead offered
her own suggestions as to how best to run the business.
Matters gradually came to a head and she was told by the supervisor that
her performance to date and the poor prospects of improvement necessitated
that he lire her. She pleaded for a grace period and was given two weeks. The
employee then raised her sales, at least temporarily, and at the same time
circulated a petition attesting to her being "courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic/'
Of the about 260 persons who responded, the overwhelming majority
merely signed the statement, l ive persons added footnotes thai ranged from,
"I shall never buy another thing from the food truck," to "I will take
pleasure in telling everyone I know what a pig you are," in case the employee
was fired.
The petition reached the manager before the supervisor had seen it.
Shortly afterward, the employee was called in and fired by the supervisor but
given lull pay to the end of a two-week peiiod.
The employee felt victimized but did not attempt to see the manager, the
director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting
the entire administrative unit where the snack wagon is a minoi seivice.
At l his point, three separate efforts al resolution ol Ihe conflict went into
effect. These involved Ihe employee's friends (an informal gmup whose
composition is not known to me), the lellow-employee (.1 poison active in .1

campus employee assocation who called her and offered to act as her
employee representative), and the Ombudsman, whom she came to see on the
suggestion ot a friend.
to these problems, a number of lessons can nevertheless be drawn from this
and similar cases. I am not enunciating administrative policy here but offering
my recommendations for whatever they are worth:
1. Before a person is hired, he ought to be told as clearly as possible what
the job will consist of, how long the probationary period will last, and how
the person will be judged in the execution of his duties.
2. Whenever there is indication of seriously unsatisfactory performance,
the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter
make one wonder why on earth the couple ever got married and how could
they have possibly lived together for so long.
3. When an employee feels unfairly dealt with, he need not hang down his
head and walk away. However, if the primary objective is to have the injustice
rectified, the person and his supporters ought to proceed in a manner that is
not only most likely to achieve immediate success but also one that will
insure a better working relationship thereafter. It is also unfair to publicly
accuse anyone on suspicion alone and the employee must realize that if
rehired, he will have to live with the same people in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and respect.
4. When the employee seeks assistance, he must allow his helpers a
reasonably sufficient time. In this case, the Ombudsman asked for a clear
field for a few days. This deteriorated into a rumor that he was refusing to
collaborate with the employee association involved.
The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with
anyone else's, is free and will work with any individual or group he sees fit. In
this case, I kept the fellow-employee informed of my moves: a courtesy
which was not always reciprocated. We have no administrative standing and
therefore no need for concern as to whether our working with a group will
establish or enhance its legitimacy. Besides, I am not so innocent as to deny
the potential of political pressure.
In this case, however, the rushing into the breach by so many, heart
warming as it was, did tend to confuse my efforts and must have bewildered
the protagonists. I am also willing to concede the possibility that whatever
concessions were made resulted from the specter of public turmoil while I
went about wasting my time in illusory efforts.
In this case, it is hard to assess the damage. Perhaps the unorthodox
notions of a young woman as to how a catering truck ought to he run were
not without merit. In his efforts to provide the University with a useful
service, a student-supervisor found himself the object of intense pressure and
potential public vilification. Ihe directoi of a thankless operation who was
not even cognizant of the developing- problem was treated to a public
criticism of the fairness with which he runs his entire administrative unit,
finally, some of us got hoarse. All of which may not add up to the end ol the
world and perhaps was not entirely in vain if we managed to learn something
from it.
In order to see the Ombudsman you need not have an earthshaking
complaint. It youi problem is important enough loi you it is important
enough for us. If you have a grievance involving the University. oi need help
and do not know where to go, or cannot gel satisfaction thiough regulai
channels, come and see us The Ombudsman is in N I B on the Inner Quad, at
ext. 3(>2N,on Wednesday. I'luirsday, and I liday .On Monday and I uesda\ Mis
assistant is available to respond to inc|uiiies and make appointments.

Herant Katehadourian
University Ombudsman
Following the summer recess, the office of the University Ombudsman at
Stanford resumed its operations on October 1, 1970, at its new quarters
(Inner Quad, NIB, Fxt. 3628). Between then and the end of the fall quarter,
we dealt with 58 issues and grievances. The distribution of these cases in
terms of nature of contact, area of complaint, source of complaint, and
outcome, do not differ sufficiently from the pattern presented in the Annual
Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21, 19 7 0; Daily, October 23,
1970) to warrant detailed description. We shall therefore only briefly present
this information, but in addition, discuss in some detail one specific case with
certain features of general interest.
Of the 58 persons who came to see the Ombudsman, about half had a
specific grievance and the rest came for information and general assistance.
Although the figures involved are not large enough to permit definitive
conclusions, there was an apparent fall in the ratio of grievances (80 percent
last year) to other reasons for coming.
Students still constituted the majority of our clientele (64 percent) and
were equally divided between undergraduates and graduates. The percentage
of staff and faculty showed a slight increase over students (from 21 to 29
percent for stal l and 6 to 10 percent for faculty). In terms of outcome, in
aboui 40 percent of the cases we only provided information and advice. Only
about one in 10 persons was referred elsewhere, and we rejected only one in
10 grievances.
Of the 18 complaints we accepted as valid, we resolved 17. This does not
mean, of course, that in all cases the original grievance was necessarily settled
since in some instances the person, reconsidering the matter, voluntarily
withdrew his complaint or settled for a compromise resolution. At the end of
the term wc also had four cases pending.
Our purpose in presenting a case in detail, which we shall do next, is to
inform rather than to embarrass. Since many have asked me how the Om
budsman operates, this example will at least show what I did in a given case.
This presentation is. however, being made with' considerable misgivings.
Although the main parties to the conflict have consented to it, tiiis may still
be perceived as a breach of confidence since it will be relatively easy to
establish the identities of the persons involved.
More critical is the choice of example. We could conceivably have selected
a case to demonstrate a pointless University policy, a rigid administrative
practice, a self-seeking attitude by a faculty member, an unreasonable de
mand by a staff member, and any number of student sins. Why we selected
this example will probably invite a variety of interpretations. Our own
reasons for the choice are as follows: The grievance involved an employment
practice that had common features with other cases wc have seen and which
will permit certain generalizations. It attracted public interest and had con
siderable potential for esca'ating into a major conflict. Multiple and diverse
efforts went into its attempted resolution.
The story starts with a young man and a young woman, lie is the
supervisor: -a graduate student who has been instrumental in initiating the
snack wagon service on campus. The venture was less than a financial success
last year, but having extensively revised his operations, he had high hopes that
with a new person in charge the pioject will not financially vindicate itself.
The employee came f rom the Midwest, where she had worked for two years
operating a snack wagon on another campus. She was looking for a similar job
and was hired at the start of the quarter.
From here on the slory is confusing.
Her version is that she was working conscientiously and with good results,
even though she often disagreed with the supervisor. For instance, she was
told to promote sales more actively, while she felt people ought lo come to
hei. She would have preferred lo offer less in the way ol candy bars and more
items such as banana nut bread (which the supervisor says she proposed to
bake in hci < wn kitchen) and so on.

From here on, I can document my own activities but can present,only a
fragmentary picture of the efforts of others. I saw the employee on a
Thursday morning and by the following afternoon I had contacted the
supervisor, the manager, and the director individually and had a lengthy
conference with all three. I also had contacts with the fellow-employee, and
tried to keep the employee informed of my moves. Meanwhile, the friends of
the employee had held an open protest meeting on the premises and there
were intimations of additional and more vigorous public exercises. The
fellow-employee had also been meeting with the employee and the other
parties in the conflict.
There was enough ambiguity in the case to make me conclude that a
re-evaluation of the employee's suitability and reasonable trial period with
clear guidelines would be only fair. In the event she could not be given back
her job (the position having been filled meanwhile), I felt she would be
offered comparable employment.
The director, while correctly contesting the legal necessity for such re
consideration (the employee's still being in the probationary six-month peri
od), nevertheless agreed to give her the benefit of the doubt, and olfered her
another position with equal pay. Since the employee specifically wished to
operate the snack wagon, she turned down the offer of alternative employ
ment and preferred to drop the matter rather than to resort to additional
efforts of having herself reinstated in her old job.
What is one to make of all this? Were we dealing with an arbitrary and
heartless employment practice whereby a helpless woman was being victi
mized, or was this a tempest in a teapot caused by an incompetent employee
and her overeager defenders? Are radicals going around fomenting trouble or
are the minions of the Establishment sytematically harassing and oppressing
the people?
While there are many possible answers to these questions, the explanations
plausible to me revolve around the all too common frailties that complicate
human relationships as well as administrative practices which, vague enough
on paper, get foggier on implementation. While there are no ready remedies
His version is that soon after hiring her he became perturbed with her
performance she drove poorly, dressed poorly, took her dog along (but
stopped after being told that health officials would object), lounged around
on the grass, and all in all conducted her operations in a lackadaisical fashion.
Worse, she refused to conform to the supervisor's wishes and instead offered
her own suggestions as to how best to run the business.
Matters gradually came to a head and she was told by the supervisor that
her performance to date and the poor prospects of improvement necessitated
that he lire her. She pleaded for a grace period and was given two weeks. The
employee then raised her sales, at least temporarily, and at the same time
circulated a petition attesting to her being "courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic/'
Of the about 260 persons who responded, the overwhelming majority
merely signed the statement, l ive persons added footnotes thai ranged from,
"I shall never buy another thing from the food truck," to "I will take
pleasure in telling everyone I know what a pig you are," in case the employee
was fired.
The petition reached the manager before the supervisor had seen it.
Shortly afterward, the employee was called in and fired by the supervisor but
given lull pay to the end of a two-week peiiod.
The employee felt victimized but did not attempt to see the manager, the
director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting
the entire administrative unit where the snack wagon is a minoi seivice.
At l his point, three separate efforts al resolution ol Ihe conflict went into
effect. These involved Ihe employee's friends (an informal gmup whose
composition is not known to me), the lellow-employee (.1 poison active in .1

campus employee assocation who called her and offered to act as her
employee representative), and the Ombudsman, whom she came to see on the
suggestion ot a friend.
to these problems, a number of lessons can nevertheless be drawn from this
and similar cases. I am not enunciating administrative policy here but offering
my recommendations for whatever they are worth:
1. Before a person is hired, he ought to be told as clearly as possible what
the job will consist of, how long the probationary period will last, and how
the person will be judged in the execution of his duties.
2. Whenever there is indication of seriously unsatisfactory performance,
the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter
make one wonder why on earth the couple ever got married and how could
they have possibly lived together for so long.
3. When an employee feels unfairly dealt with, he need not hang down his
head and walk away. However, if the primary objective is to have the injustice
rectified, the person and his supporters ought to proceed in a manner that is
not only most likely to achieve immediate success but also one that will
insure a better working relationship thereafter. It is also unfair to publicly
accuse anyone on suspicion alone and the employee must realize that if
rehired, he will have to live with the same people in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and respect.
4. When the employee seeks assistance, he must allow his helpers a
reasonably sufficient time. In this case, the Ombudsman asked for a clear
field for a few days. This deteriorated into a rumor that he was refusing to
collaborate with the employee association involved.
The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with
anyone else's, is free and will work with any individual or group he sees fit. In
this case, I kept the fellow-employee informed of my moves: a courtesy
which was not always reciprocated. We have no administrative standing and
therefore no need for concern as to whether our working with a group will
establish or enhance its legitimacy. Besides, I am not so innocent as to deny
the potential of political pressure.
In this case, however, the rushing into the breach by so many, heart
warming as it was, did tend to confuse my efforts and must have bewildered
the protagonists. I am also willing to concede the possibility that whatever
concessions were made resulted from the specter of public turmoil while I
went about wasting my time in illusory efforts.
In this case, it is hard to assess the damage. Perhaps the unorthodox
notions of a young woman as to how a catering truck ought to he run were
not without merit. In his efforts to provide the University with a useful
service, a student-supervisor found himself the object of intense pressure and
potential public vilification. Ihe directoi of a thankless operation who was
not even cognizant of the developing- problem was treated to a public

The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with

the potential of political pressure.
In this case, however, the rushing into the breach by so many, heart

went about wasting my time in illusory efforts.

University Ombudsman
Following the summer recess, the office of the University Ombudsman at
Stanford resumed its operations on October 1, 1970, at its new quarters
(Inner Quad, NIB, Fxt. 3628). Between then and the end of the fall quarter,
we dealt with 58 issues and grievances. The distribution of these cases in
terms of nature of contact, area of complaint, source of complaint, and
outcome, do not differ sufficiently from the pattern presented in the Annual
Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21, 19 7 0; Daily, October 23,
1970) to warrant detailed description. We shall therefore only briefly present
this information, but in addition, discuss in some detail one specific case with
certain features of general interest.
Of the 58 persons who came to see the Ombudsman, about half had a
specific grievance and the rest came for information and general assistance.
Although the figures involved are not large enough to permit definitive
conclusions, there was an apparent fall in the ratio of grievances (80 percent
last year) to other reasons for coming.
Students still constituted the majority of our clientele (64 percent) and
were equally divided between undergraduates and graduates. The percentage
of staff and faculty showed a slight increase over students (from 21 to 29
percent for stal l and 6 to 10 percent for faculty). In terms of outcome, in
aboui 40 percent of the cases we only provided information and advice. Only
about one in 10 persons was referred elsewhere, and we rejected only one in
10 grievances.
Of the 18 complaints we accepted as valid, we resolved 17. This does not
mean, of course, that in all cases the original grievance was necessarily settled
since in some instances the person, reconsidering the matter, voluntarily
withdrew his complaint or settled for a compromise resolution. At the end of
the term wc also had four cases pending.
Our purpose in presenting a case in detail, which we shall do next, is to
inform rather than to embarrass. Since many have asked me how the Om
budsman operates, this example will at least show what I did in a given case.
This presentation is. however, being made with' considerable misgivings.
Although the main parties to the conflict have consented to it, tiiis may still
be perceived as a breach of confidence since it will be relatively easy to
establish the identities of the persons involved.
More critical is the choice of example. We could conceivably have selected
a case to demonstrate a pointless University policy, a rigid administrative
practice, a self-seeking attitude by a faculty member, an unreasonable de
mand by a staff member, and any number of student sins. Why we selected
this example will probably invite a variety of interpretations. Our own
reasons for the choice are as follows: The grievance involved an employment
practice that had common features with other cases wc have seen and which
will permit certain generalizations. It attracted public interest and had con
siderable potential for esca'ating into a major conflict. Multiple and diverse
efforts went into its attempted resolution.
The story starts with a young man and a young woman, lie is the
supervisor: -a graduate student who has been instrumental in initiating the
snack wagon service on campus. The venture was less than a financial success
last year, but having extensively revised his operations, he had high hopes that
with a new person in charge the pioject will not financially vindicate itself.
The employee came f rom the Midwest, where she had worked for two years
operating a snack wagon on another campus. She was looking for a similar job
and was hired at the start of the quarter.
From here on the slory is confusing.
Her version is that she was working conscientiously and with good results,
even though she often disagreed with the supervisor. For instance, she was
told to promote sales more actively, while she felt people ought lo come to
hei. She would have preferred lo offer less in the way ol candy bars and more
items such as banana nut bread (which the supervisor says she proposed to
bake in hci < wn kitchen) and so on.

From here on, I can document my own activities but can present,only a
fragmentary picture of the efforts of others. I saw the employee on a
Thursday morning and by the following afternoon I had contacted the
supervisor, the manager, and the director individually and had a lengthy
conference with all three. I also had contacts with the fellow-employee, and
tried to keep the employee informed of my moves. Meanwhile, the friends of
the employee had held an open protest meeting on the premises and there
were intimations of additional and more vigorous public exercises. The
fellow-employee had also been meeting with the employee and the other
parties in the conflict.
There was enough ambiguity in the case to make me conclude that a
re-evaluation of the employee's suitability and reasonable trial period with
clear guidelines would be only fair. In the event she could not be given back
her job (the position having been filled meanwhile), I felt she would be
offered comparable employment.
The director, while correctly contesting the legal necessity for such re
consideration (the employee's still being in the probationary six-month peri
od), nevertheless agreed to give her the benefit of the doubt, and olfered her
another position with equal pay. Since the employee specifically wished to
operate the snack wagon, she turned down the offer of alternative employ
ment and preferred to drop the matter rather than to resort to additional
efforts of having herself reinstated in her old job.
What is one to make of all this? Were we dealing with an arbitrary and
heartless employment practice whereby a helpless woman was being victi
mized, or was this a tempest in a teapot caused by an incompetent employee
and her overeager defenders? Are radicals going around fomenting trouble or
are the minions of the Establishment sytematically harassing and oppressing
the people?
While there are many possible answers to these questions, the explanations
plausible to me revolve around the all too common frailties that complicate
human relationships as well as administrative practices which, vague enough
on paper, get foggier on implementation. While there are no ready remedies
His version is that soon after hiring her he became perturbed with her
performance she drove poorly, dressed poorly, took her dog along (but
stopped after being told that health officials would object), lounged around
on the grass, and all in all conducted her operations in a lackadaisical fashion.
Worse, she refused to conform to the supervisor's wishes and instead offered
her own suggestions as to how best to run the business.
Matters gradually came to a head and she was told by the supervisor that
her performance to date and the poor prospects of improvement necessitated
that he lire her. She pleaded for a grace period and was given two weeks. The
employee then raised her sales, at least temporarily, and at the same time
circulated a petition attesting to her being "courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic/'
Of the about 260 persons who responded, the overwhelming majority
merely signed the statement, l ive persons added footnotes thai ranged from,
"I shall never buy another thing from the food truck," to "I will take
pleasure in telling everyone I know what a pig you are," in case the employee
was fired.
The petition reached the manager before the supervisor had seen it.
Shortly afterward, the employee was called in and fired by the supervisor but
given lull pay to the end of a two-week peiiod.
The employee felt victimized but did not attempt to see the manager, the
director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting
the entire administrative unit where the snack wagon is a minoi seivice.
At l his point, three separate efforts al resolution ol Ihe conflict went into
effect. These involved Ihe employee's friends (an informal gmup whose
composition is not known to me), the lellow-employee (.1 poison active in .1

campus employee assocation who called her and offered to act as her
employee representative), and the Ombudsman, whom she came to see on the
suggestion ot a friend.
to these problems, a number of lessons can nevertheless be drawn from this
and similar cases. I am not enunciating administrative policy here but offering
my recommendations for whatever they are worth:
1. Before a person is hired, he ought to be told as clearly as possible what
the job will consist of, how long the probationary period will last, and how
the person will be judged in the execution of his duties.
2. Whenever there is indication of seriously unsatisfactory performance,
the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter
make one wonder why on earth the couple ever got married and how could
they have possibly lived together for so long.
3. When an employee feels unfairly dealt with, he need not hang down his
head and walk away. However, if the primary objective is to have the injustice
rectified, the person and his supporters ought to proceed in a manner that is
not only most likely to achieve immediate success but also one that will
insure a better working relationship thereafter. It is also unfair to publicly
accuse anyone on suspicion alone and the employee must realize that if
rehired, he will have to live with the same people in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and respect.
4. When the employee seeks assistance, he must allow his helpers a
reasonably sufficient time. In this case, the Ombudsman asked for a clear
field for a few days. This deteriorated into a rumor that he was refusing to
collaborate with the employee association involved.
The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with
anyone else's, is free and will work with any individual or group he sees fit. In

the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter
make one wonder why on earth the couple ever got married and how could
they have possibly lived together for so long.
3. When an employee feels unfairly dealt with, he need not hang down his
head and walk away. However, if the primary objective is to have the injustice
rectified, the person and his supporters ought to proceed in a manner that is
not only most likely to achieve immediate success but also one that will
insure a better working relationship thereafter. It is also unfair to publicly
accuse anyone on suspicion alone and the employee must realize that if
rehired, he will have to live with the same people in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and respect.
4. When the employee seeks assistance, he must allow his helpers a
reasonably sufficient time. In this case, the Ombudsman asked for a clear
field for a few days. This deteriorated into a rumor that he was refusing to
collaborate with the employee association involved.
The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with
anyone else's, is free and will work with any individual or group he sees fit. In
this case, I kept the fellow-employee informed of my moves: a courtesy
which was not always reciprocated. We have no administrative standing and
therefore no need for concern as to whether our working with a group will
establish or enhance its legitimacy. Besides, I am not so innocent as to deny
the potential of political pressure.
In this case, however, the rushing into the breach by so many, heart
warming as it was, did tend to confuse my efforts and must have bewildered
the protagonists. I am also willing to concede the possibility that whatever
concessions were made resulted from the specter of public turmoil while I
went about wasting my time in illusory efforts.
In this case, it is hard to assess the damage. Perhaps the unorthodox
notions of a young woman as to how a catering truck ought to he run were
not without merit. In his efforts to provide the University with a useful
service, a student-supervisor found himself the object of intense pressure and
potential public vilification. Ihe directoi of a thankless operation who was
not even cognizant of the developing- problem was treated to a public
criticism of the fairness with which he runs his entire administrative unit,
finally, some of us got hoarse. All of which may not add up to the end ol the
world and perhaps was not entirely in vain if we managed to learn something
from it.

University Ombudsman
Following the summer recess, the office of the University Ombudsman at
Stanford resumed its operations on October 1, 1970, at its new quarters
(Inner Quad, NIB, Fxt. 3628). Between then and the end of the fall quarter,
we dealt with 58 issues and grievances. The distribution of these cases in
terms of nature of contact, area of complaint, source of complaint, and
outcome, do not differ sufficiently from the pattern presented in the Annual
Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21, 19 7 0; Daily, October 23,
1970) to warrant detailed description. We shall therefore only briefly present
this information, but in addition, discuss in some detail one specific case with
certain features of general interest.
Of the 58 persons who came to see the Ombudsman, about half had a
specific grievance and the rest came for information and general assistance.
Although the figures involved are not large enough to permit definitive
conclusions, there was an apparent fall in the ratio of grievances (80 percent
last year) to other reasons for coming.
Students still constituted the majority of our clientele (64 percent) and
were equally divided between undergraduates and graduates. The percentage
of staff and faculty showed a slight increase over students (from 21 to 29
percent for stal l and 6 to 10 percent for faculty). In terms of outcome, in
aboui 40 percent of the cases we only provided information and advice. Only
about one in 10 persons was referred elsewhere, and we rejected only one in
10 grievances.
Of the 18 complaints we accepted as valid, we resolved 17. This does not
mean, of course, that in all cases the original grievance was necessarily settled
since in some instances the person, reconsidering the matter, voluntarily
withdrew his complaint or settled for a compromise resolution. At the end of
the term wc also had four cases pending.
Our purpose in presenting a case in detail, which we shall do next, is to
inform rather than to embarrass. Since many have asked me how the Om
budsman operates, this example will at least show what I did in a given case.
This presentation is. however, being made with' considerable misgivings.
Although the main parties to the conflict have consented to it, tiiis may still
be perceived as a breach of confidence since it will be relatively easy to
establish the identities of the persons involved.
More critical is the choice of example. We could conceivably have selected
a case to demonstrate a pointless University policy, a rigid administrative
practice, a self-seeking attitude by a faculty member, an unreasonable de
mand by a staff member, and any number of student sins. Why we selected
this example will probably invite a variety of interpretations. Our own
reasons for the choice are as follows: The grievance involved an employment
practice that had common features with other cases wc have seen and which
will permit certain generalizations. It attracted public interest and had con
siderable potential for esca'ating into a major conflict. Multiple and diverse
efforts went into its attempted resolution.
The story starts with a young man and a young woman, lie is the
supervisor: -a graduate student who has been instrumental in initiating the
snack wagon service on campus. The venture was less than a financial success
last year, but having extensively revised his operations, he had high hopes that
with a new person in charge the pioject will not financially vindicate itself.
The employee came f rom the Midwest, where she had worked for two years
operating a snack wagon on another campus. She was looking for a similar job
and was hired at the start of the quarter.
From here on the slory is confusing.
Her version is that she was working conscientiously and with good results,
even though she often disagreed with the supervisor. For instance, she was
told to promote sales more actively, while she felt people ought lo come to
hei. She would have preferred lo offer less in the way ol candy bars and more
items such as banana nut bread (which the supervisor says she proposed to
bake in hci < wn kitchen) and so on.

From here on, I can document my own activities but can present,only a
fragmentary picture of the efforts of others. I saw the employee on a
Thursday morning and by the following afternoon I had contacted the
supervisor, the manager, and the director individually and had a lengthy
conference with all three. I also had contacts with the fellow-employee, and
tried to keep the employee informed of my moves. Meanwhile, the friends of
the employee had held an open protest meeting on the premises and there
were intimations of additional and more vigorous public exercises. The
fellow-employee had also been meeting with the employee and the other
parties in the conflict.
There was enough ambiguity in the case to make me conclude that a
re-evaluation of the employee's suitability and reasonable trial period with
clear guidelines would be only fair. In the event she could not be given back
her job (the position having been filled meanwhile), I felt she would be
offered comparable employment.
The director, while correctly contesting the legal necessity for such re
consideration (the employee's still being in the probationary six-month peri
od), nevertheless agreed to give her the benefit of the doubt, and olfered her
another position with equal pay. Since the employee specifically wished to
operate the snack wagon, she turned down the offer of alternative employ
ment and preferred to drop the matter rather than to resort to additional
efforts of having herself reinstated in her old job.
What is one to make of all this? Were we dealing with an arbitrary and
heartless employment practice whereby a helpless woman was being victi
mized, or was this a tempest in a teapot caused by an incompetent employee
and her overeager defenders? Are radicals going around fomenting trouble or
are the minions of the Establishment sytematically harassing and oppressing
the people?
While there are many possible answers to these questions, the explanations
plausible to me revolve around the all too common frailties that complicate
human relationships as well as administrative practices which, vague enough
on paper, get foggier on implementation. While there are no ready remedies
His version is that soon after hiring her he became perturbed with her
performance she drove poorly, dressed poorly, took her dog along (but
stopped after being told that health officials would object), lounged around
on the grass, and all in all conducted her operations in a lackadaisical fashion.
Worse, she refused to conform to the supervisor's wishes and instead offered
her own suggestions as to how best to run the business.
Matters gradually came to a head and she was told by the supervisor that
her performance to date and the poor prospects of improvement necessitated
that he lire her. She pleaded for a grace period and was given two weeks. The
employee then raised her sales, at least temporarily, and at the same time
circulated a petition attesting to her being "courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic/'
Of the about 260 persons who responded, the overwhelming majority
merely signed the statement, l ive persons added footnotes thai ranged from,
"I shall never buy another thing from the food truck," to "I will take
pleasure in telling everyone I know what a pig you are," in case the employee
was fired.
The petition reached the manager before the supervisor had seen it.
Shortly afterward, the employee was called in and fired by the supervisor but
given lull pay to the end of a two-week peiiod.
The employee felt victimized but did not attempt to see the manager, the
director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting
the entire administrative unit where the snack wagon is a minoi seivice.
At l his point, three separate efforts al resolution ol Ihe conflict went into
effect. These involved Ihe employee's friends (an informal gmup whose
composition is not known to me), the lellow-employee (.1 poison active in .1

campus employee assocation who called her and offered to act as her
employee representative), and the Ombudsman, whom she came to see on the
suggestion ot a friend.
to these problems, a number of lessons can nevertheless be drawn from this
and similar cases. I am not enunciating administrative policy here but offering
my recommendations for whatever they are worth:
1. Before a person is hired, he ought to be told as clearly as possible what
the job will consist of, how long the probationary period will last, and how
the person will be judged in the execution of his duties.
2. Whenever there is indication of seriously unsatisfactory performance,
the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter

director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting

to these problems, a number of lessons can nevertheless be drawn from this
and similar cases. I am not enunciating administrative policy here but offering
my recommendations for whatever they are worth:
1. Before a person is hired, he ought to be told as clearly as possible what
the job will consist of, how long the probationary period will last, and how
the person will be judged in the execution of his duties.
2. Whenever there is indication of seriously unsatisfactory performance,
the supervisor ought to state, in writing, what he feels the problems are. 1 his
lets the employee know where he stands and alerts the supervisor's own
superiors. Otherwise, when performance is evaluated retrospectively, the
situation becomes like a divorce proceeding: the charges and counter
make one wonder why on earth the couple ever got married and how could
they have possibly lived together for so long.
3. When an employee feels unfairly dealt with, he need not hang down his
head and walk away. However, if the primary objective is to have the injustice
rectified, the person and his supporters ought to proceed in a manner that is
not only most likely to achieve immediate success but also one that will
insure a better working relationship thereafter. It is also unfair to publicly
accuse anyone on suspicion alone and the employee must realize that if
rehired, he will have to live with the same people in an atmosphere of mutual
trust and respect.
4. When the employee seeks assistance, he must allow his helpers a
reasonably sufficient time. In this case, the Ombudsman asked for a clear
field for a few days. This deteriorated into a rumor that he was refusing to
collaborate with the employee association involved.
The Ombudsman, while under no obligation to link his efforts with
anyone else's, is free and will work with any individual or group he sees fit. In
this case, I kept the fellow-employee informed of my moves: a courtesy
which was not always reciprocated. We have no administrative standing and
therefore no need for concern as to whether our working with a group will
establish or enhance its legitimacy. Besides, I am not so innocent as to deny
the potential of political pressure.
In this case, however, the rushing into the breach by so many, heart
warming as it was, did tend to confuse my efforts and must have bewildered
the protagonists. I am also willing to concede the possibility that whatever
concessions were made resulted from the specter of public turmoil while I
went about wasting my time in illusory efforts.
In this case, it is hard to assess the damage. Perhaps the unorthodox
notions of a young woman as to how a catering truck ought to he run were
not without merit. In his efforts to provide the University with a useful
service, a student-supervisor found himself the object of intense pressure and
potential public vilification. Ihe directoi of a thankless operation who was
not even cognizant of the developing- problem was treated to a public
criticism of the fairness with which he runs his entire administrative unit,
finally, some of us got hoarse. All of which may not add up to the end ol the
world and perhaps was not entirely in vain if we managed to learn something
from it.

University Ombudsman
Following the summer recess, the office of the University Ombudsman at
Stanford resumed its operations on October 1, 1970, at its new quarters
(Inner Quad, NIB, Fxt. 3628). Between then and the end of the fall quarter,
we dealt with 58 issues and grievances. The distribution of these cases in
terms of nature of contact, area of complaint, source of complaint, and
outcome, do not differ sufficiently from the pattern presented in the Annual
Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21, 19 7 0; Daily, October 23,
1970) to warrant detailed description. We shall therefore only briefly present
this information, but in addition, discuss in some detail one specific case with
certain features of general interest.
Of the 58 persons who came to see the Ombudsman, about half had a
specific grievance and the rest came for information and general assistance.
Although the figures involved are not large enough to permit definitive
conclusions, there was an apparent fall in the ratio of grievances (80 percent
last year) to other reasons for coming.
Students still constituted the majority of our clientele (64 percent) and
were equally divided between undergraduates and graduates. The percentage
of staff and faculty showed a slight increase over students (from 21 to 29
percent for stal l and 6 to 10 percent for faculty). In terms of outcome, in
aboui 40 percent of the cases we only provided information and advice. Only
about one in 10 persons was referred elsewhere, and we rejected only one in
10 grievances.
Of the 18 complaints we accepted as valid, we resolved 17. This does not
mean, of course, that in all cases the original grievance was necessarily settled
since in some instances the person, reconsidering the matter, voluntarily
withdrew his complaint or settled for a compromise resolution. At the end of
the term wc also had four cases pending.
Our purpose in presenting a case in detail, which we shall do next, is to
inform rather than to embarrass. Since many have asked me how the Om
budsman operates, this example will at least show what I did in a given case.
This presentation is. however, being made with' considerable misgivings.
Although the main parties to the conflict have consented to it, tiiis may still
be perceived as a breach of confidence since it will be relatively easy to
establish the identities of the persons involved.
More critical is the choice of example. We could conceivably have selected
a case to demonstrate a pointless University policy, a rigid administrative
practice, a self-seeking attitude by a faculty member, an unreasonable de
mand by a staff member, and any number of student sins. Why we selected
this example will probably invite a variety of interpretations. Our own
reasons for the choice are as follows: The grievance involved an employment
practice that had common features with other cases wc have seen and which
will permit certain generalizations. It attracted public interest and had con
siderable potential for esca'ating into a major conflict. Multiple and diverse
efforts went into its attempted resolution.
The story starts with a young man and a young woman, lie is the
supervisor: -a graduate student who has been instrumental in initiating the
snack wagon service on campus. The venture was less than a financial success
last year, but having extensively revised his operations, he had high hopes that
with a new person in charge the pioject will not financially vindicate itself.
The employee came f rom the Midwest, where she had worked for two years
operating a snack wagon on another campus. She was looking for a similar job
and was hired at the start of the quarter.
From here on the slory is confusing.
Her version is that she was working conscientiously and with good results,
even though she often disagreed with the supervisor. For instance, she was
told to promote sales more actively, while she felt people ought lo come to
hei. She would have preferred lo offer less in the way ol candy bars and more
items such as banana nut bread (which the supervisor says she proposed to
bake in hci < wn kitchen) and so on.

From here on, I can document my own activities but can present,only a
fragmentary picture of the efforts of others. I saw the employee on a
Thursday morning and by the following afternoon I had contacted the
supervisor, the manager, and the director individually and had a lengthy
conference with all three. I also had contacts with the fellow-employee, and
tried to keep the employee informed of my moves. Meanwhile, the friends of
the employee had held an open protest meeting on the premises and there
were intimations of additional and more vigorous public exercises. The
fellow-employee had also been meeting with the employee and the other
parties in the conflict.
There was enough ambiguity in the case to make me conclude that a
re-evaluation of the employee's suitability and reasonable trial period with
clear guidelines would be only fair. In the event she could not be given back
her job (the position having been filled meanwhile), I felt she would be
offered comparable employment.
The director, while correctly contesting the legal necessity for such re
consideration (the employee's still being in the probationary six-month peri
od), nevertheless agreed to give her the benefit of the doubt, and olfered her
another position with equal pay. Since the employee specifically wished to
operate the snack wagon, she turned down the offer of alternative employ
ment and preferred to drop the matter rather than to resort to additional
efforts of having herself reinstated in her old job.
What is one to make of all this? Were we dealing with an arbitrary and
heartless employment practice whereby a helpless woman was being victi
mized, or was this a tempest in a teapot caused by an incompetent employee
and her overeager defenders? Are radicals going around fomenting trouble or
are the minions of the Establishment sytematically harassing and oppressing
the people?
While there are many possible answers to these questions, the explanations
plausible to me revolve around the all too common frailties that complicate
human relationships as well as administrative practices which, vague enough
on paper, get foggier on implementation. While there are no ready remedies
His version is that soon after hiring her he became perturbed with her
performance she drove poorly, dressed poorly, took her dog along (but
stopped after being told that health officials would object), lounged around
on the grass, and all in all conducted her operations in a lackadaisical fashion.
Worse, she refused to conform to the supervisor's wishes and instead offered
her own suggestions as to how best to run the business.
Matters gradually came to a head and she was told by the supervisor that
her performance to date and the poor prospects of improvement necessitated
that he lire her. She pleaded for a grace period and was given two weeks. The
employee then raised her sales, at least temporarily, and at the same time
circulated a petition attesting to her being "courteous, efficient, timely, and
energetic/'
Of the about 260 persons who responded, the overwhelming majority
merely signed the statement, l ive persons added footnotes thai ranged from,
"I shall never buy another thing from the food truck," to "I will take
pleasure in telling everyone I know what a pig you are," in case the employee
was fired.
The petition reached the manager before the supervisor had seen it.
Shortly afterward, the employee was called in and fired by the supervisor but
given lull pay to the end of a two-week peiiod.
The employee felt victimized but did not attempt to see the manager, the
director, or anyone in the Personnel Office (she had not even heard of the
Ombudsman). Instead, she sent an accusatory let lei to The Daily, indicting
the entire administrative unit where the snack wagon is a minoi seivice.
