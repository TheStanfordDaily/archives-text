# Firesign Fanatics Freak-out Tonight
## 
### LEE GREATHOUSE 
Firesign Theatre didn't invt t
insanity. They just made it funny.
They, and their friends will be
here tonight at 8 in Memorial
Auditorium. Betty Jo Bialoski,
Ralph Spoilsport, Nick Danger,
Catherwood, Joe and Ed, Mr. and
Mrs. Smith, Lieutenant Bradshaw,
that slimy weasle Roccoco—the
whole gang; they'll all be here.
All four of them.
You may not know what
Firesign is but you've
undoubtedly brushed against it in
the last few weeks. It's in the air.
Perhaps you heard part of it
out of the corner of your ear.
Someone opened his mouth and a
warped cackle came out. He said,
"Let's stand him on his head."
Then someone else made a
crashing noise and another voice
that sounded suspiciously like
W.C. Fields said in sorrowful
tones, "Oh, he's no fun, he fell
rig!.' over." And they all laughed,
as if what they said was funny.
Suspicious Succotash
Or maybe one night you
noticed the dinner table
conversation beginning to unravel
somewhere between the salad and
the succotash. It started when
that new guy you'd been arguing
politics with got a strange look in
his eye. He suddenly spoke up in a
new voice—a whiny, oily voice.
You noticed goose pimples on the
jello. The corn was frantically
trying to stuff lima beans in its
ears.
"Good afternoon, Mr.
Danger," you heard him say, "I'm
Rocky Roccoco." Your coffee
turned cold.
From across the table came the
appropriate reply. A tall dark
voice with regular features and
boy scout mien said, "Thanks
half-pint. You just saved me a lot
of investigative work." and the fat
melted off your pork chop.
Freaky Fans
Firesign, you see, is coming
here and Firesign fans are getting
ready. Firesign fans don't form
clubs. Few of them have ever seen
Firesign perform. Firesign fanship
can best be described as a

coast-to-coast cult. The salute of
recognition is tossing off a line
from one of the records and
having the next line quoted back
to you.
But no one tries to become a
worshipper. Firesign is just that
way. It's an entirely new kind of
comedy, so different and so
surprising that it sticks in your
memory. The records are aural
movies, filled with strange
characters playing against "sets"
constructed entirely out of sound.
As you listen it slowly dawns
on you that you are being told
stories—complicated stories;
stories that weave in and oi'.t ir>
auditory tangles that only begin
to straighten out about the third
listening; stories that just
shouldn't make any kind of sense.
But do. Dozens of different
character voices parade across the
records spouting what must be
nonsense. But isn't.
Started Straight
The four freaks who cook up
the Firesign dishes began their
careers in the straight
communications world. They
learned its skills on Los Angeles
radio and television and they
learned how to make fun of it,
which they do with pinpoint
accuracy and devastating effect.
What the Firesigners do is take
your world and mine and shove it
about three inches off kilter.
If it never occurred to you that
sanity could be dull, come help
yourself to a generous serving of
healthy madness tonight. But be
careful. Firesign is addictive.

Firesign, you see, is coming
here and Firesign fans are getting
ready. Firesign fans don't form
clubs. Few of them have ever seen
Firesign perform. Firesign fanship
can best be described as a

coast-to-coast cult. The salute of
recognition is tossing off a line
from one of the records and
having the next line quoted back
to you.
But no one tries to become a
worshipper. Firesign is just that
way. It's an entirely new kind of
comedy, so different and so
surprising that it sticks in your
memory. The records are aural
movies, filled with strange
characters playing against "sets"
constructed entirely out of sound.
As you listen it slowly dawns
on you that you are being told
stories—complicated stories;
stories that weave in and oi'.t ir>
auditory tangles that only begin
to straighten out about the third
listening; stories that just
shouldn't make any kind of sense.
But do. Dozens of different
character voices parade across the
records spouting what must be
nonsense. But isn't.
Started Straight
The four freaks who cook up
the Firesign dishes began their
careers in the straight
communications world. They
learned its skills on Los Angeles
radio and television and they
learned how to make fun of it,
which they do with pinpoint
accuracy and devastating effect.
What the Firesigners do is take
your world and mine and shove it
about three inches off kilter.
If it never occurred to you that
sanity could be dull, come help
yourself to a generous serving of
healthy madness tonight. But be
careful. Firesign is addictive.

FIRESIGN THEATRE—These four loons will attract hundreds more
to Mem Aud tonight to hear excerpts from "Don't Crush That Dwarf"
and"The Mutt and Smut Show," among other goodies.
Firesign Theatre didn't invt t
insanity. They just made it funny.
They, and their friends will be
here tonight at 8 in Memorial
Auditorium. Betty Jo Bialoski,
Ralph Spoilsport, Nick Danger,
Catherwood, Joe and Ed, Mr. and
Mrs. Smith, Lieutenant Bradshaw,
that slimy weasle Roccoco—the
whole gang; they'll all be here.
All four of them.
You may not know what
Firesign is but you've
undoubtedly brushed against it in
the last few weeks. It's in the air.
Perhaps you heard part of it
out of the corner of your ear.
Someone opened his mouth and a
warped cackle came out. He said,
"Let's stand him on his head."
Then someone else made a
crashing noise and another voice
that sounded suspiciously like
W.C. Fields said in sorrowful
tones, "Oh, he's no fun, he fell
rig!.' over." And they all laughed,
as if what they said was funny.
Suspicious Succotash
Or maybe one night you
noticed the dinner table
conversation beginning to unravel
somewhere between the salad and
the succotash. It started when
that new guy you'd been arguing
politics with got a strange look in
his eye. He suddenly spoke up in a
new voice—a whiny, oily voice.
You noticed goose pimples on the
jello. The corn was frantically
trying to stuff lima beans in its
ears.
"Good afternoon, Mr.
Danger," you heard him say, "I'm
Rocky Roccoco." Your coffee
turned cold.
From across the table came the
appropriate reply. A tall dark
voice with regular features and
boy scout mien said, "Thanks
half-pint. You just saved me a lot
of investigative work." and the fat
melted off your pork chop.
