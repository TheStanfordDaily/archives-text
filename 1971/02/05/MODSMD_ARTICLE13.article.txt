# Dancers Trace Culture
## 
### LORI GOETZ 
Conceived, created, and
produced entirely by Black
students at Stanford, "An Ancient
Love" is a well-balanced,
fast-moving program of
interpretive dance which traces
the history of Black peoples from
ancient Africa to the present day.
The Black Legacy Dancers have
done a fine job in capturing the
importance of vital, expressive
dance in both past and present
Black cultures.
"An Ancient Love" is not
merely entertainment, however.
The program is broken into three
sections, each dealing with a
different time period. Dances
within each section are unified by
brief narrations which articulate
the political and cultural impact
of historical events upon the
Black community from a Black
perspective.
Graceful Movement
Perhaps the most striking
aspect of the program is the
nature and quality of the dancers'
movements. Despite variation and
modification, a remarkable degree
of continuity exists throughout
the program, particularly through
expressive use of the head,
shoulders, and hips in both simple
and complex movements.
The original music, composed
by Woodi Webb and played by
"Smoke," and a wide variety of
costumes, ranging from leotards
to brilliant body paint, also
contribute to the dynamic quality
of the performance.
The opening number, "Strange,
Unnoticed Sensations," is a very
effective piece, reminiscent of the
ancient African movements and

rhythms which are the roots of
Black culture. Choreographer
Shirley Allen makes excellent use
of patterns and floor space, and
continues to do so throughout the
program. The dancers themselves
are sure and comfortable with
their movements.
Ancient Africa
Immediately following is "Zig
Zag Tracks," also evocative of
ancient Africa. Karin Collins'
alert, quick, bird-like movements,
and especially her facial
expressions and wide eyes, make
this one of the most exciting
numbers in the program.
Lawrence Owusu, an African
student, appears alone in an
original African dance sequence
that begins with an extraordinary
trembling movement involving his
entire body.
Here the program moves
forward to the enslavement of the
Blacks by white Americans. The
narration preceding "Black Tears"
is one of the best in the program
as it explains the central role
dance played in mocking white
slave owners and keeping Black
pride alive. "Oneness," a moving
number done to the song, "St.
James Infirmary," closes the first
section of the performance.
Early 1900's
The second section dealing
with the early 1900's, features
two numbers by Les Williams.
Williams, who is also the dance
consultant, has clearly had a great
deal of dancing and performing

experience. His "Song and Dance
Man" and "Bojangles" were
polished, delightful, and
humorous performances featuring
some very fine tap dancingâ€”an
almost forgotten art.
Following a brief intermission is
"Nerveless to Feel," a solo
number that is a highlight in the
program. This is an eerie almost
dream-like number with
marvelous music. Essiebea L.
Hayes uses her hands beautifully
and adds a new dimension by
speaking as she dances.
Burst of Energy
"Tribal Jazz Wombs," the final
number, is a burst of energy and
color featuring most of the
dancers in vibrant costumes and
again displaying Shirley Allen's
fine choreographic abilities.
The number ends dramatically
with the appearance of two men
carrying guns who dance a fight
scene reminiscent of the earlier
"Survival Men," and in so doing,
affirm the fact that the struggle
for Black liberation and survival is
not yet over.
"An Ancient Love" is quite a
remarkable performance. Go with
a willingness to understand and
experience a powerful, vital means
of expression that has helped
Black peoples to survive through
years of suffering and oppression,
and you will be well rewarded.
"An Ancient Love" will be
performed tonight and tomorrow
night at 8 p.m. in the Women's
Gym, as well as February 11, 12,
and 13. Tickets cost $2.
