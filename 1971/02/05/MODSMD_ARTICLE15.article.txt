# Student Gives Draft Views

Peter Knutson, chairman of the
Stanford Draft Repeal Movement,
will testify early next week before
the Senate Armed Services
Committee.
He will be one of the first (and
perhaps the only) draft-eligible
men to speak against the
extension of the current selective
services law, which expires June
30,1971.
"For all 1 know, I could be a
token student," Knutson says. He
sent a letter to Sen. John Stennis
(D-Miss), the hawkish committee
chairman, asking to testify. To his
surprise, he was cleared to speak.
"All the letters and telegrams
are starting to have an effect," the
freshman stated. "Stennis has
been getting a lot of pressure."
President Richard Lyman sent
Stennis a telegram last weekend,
urging him to open the hearings to
students.
"I believe open hearings not
restricted to government witnesses
are essential on any legislation
which so directly affects all young
Americans and which has a
profound effect on American
higher education as well as the
entire fabric of American
society," the telegram said.
