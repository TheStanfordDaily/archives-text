## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Lyuba Bershadaskaya, a Soviet
Jew and a former translator for W.
Averill Harriman, told a
middle-aged audience of 500
which gathered in Memorial
Church last night that the Russian
government was a "strong
animal."

Mrs. Bershadaskaya, who
worked for Harriman during
World War 11, recounted a 1946
train ride in which she, and all
others who had worked for
foreigners, were transported to a
concentration camp in Siberia.
During the 28-day journey, the
prisoners were fed heavily-salted

fish, but were given water only
three times. Mrs. Bershadaskaya
remained at the camp for ten
years, and was forced to wash 200
pieces of soldiers' laundry
everyday.
"When I was in the camp," she
said, "60 or 70 people died each
day."
When she returned to Moscow
in 1956, Mrs. Bershadaskaya
found that much had changed.
Her three children had been raised
by the State and were taught to
shun her as a criminal.
Mrs. Bershadaskaya called
upon Americans to try to
influence the Soviet government
to stop persecuting the Jews. She
acknowledged that such pressure
enabled her to obtain a visa.
She urged Americans to write
letters to Jews in Russia.
