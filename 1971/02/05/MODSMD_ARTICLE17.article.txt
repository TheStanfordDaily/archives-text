# Card Basketballers Face Golden Bears
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team will
try to break a six game losing
streak when they face the
Californ : a Bears twice this
weekend. Tonight at 8:00 p.m.,
the Indians travel to Berkeley and
tomorrow at 2:30 p.m., they host
the Bears at Maples Pavilion in a
televised rematch.
Cal comes into the game with
an overall 9-6 record and a 1-3
league mark. The Bears have four
outstanding individual performers,
but they have had trouble
working together effectively as a
team.
The Bears have been led by
returning AII-Pac-8 forward,
Jackie Itidgle who is averaging
16.3 points and 8.3 rebounds a
game. Junior center Ansley Truitt
and junior guard Phil Chenier are
close behind with averages of
better than 15 points a game.
Senior guard Charlie Johnson is
scoring at a 13.1 clip, but he has
failed to regain the form which

made him an All-Conference
sleeetion two years ago. 6-6
sophomore forward John
Coughran closes out the starting
lineup.
Forward Chuck Moore should
be able to return to the Stanford
lineup this weekend, but Bob
Buell is still questionable. The
availability of 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig is still uncertain.
The Stanford freshmen will
also face the Cal Frosh twice this
weekend. 6-9 center Mike Mann
should get a good test from Cal's
6-8 center, Ted Rudow, who has
been one of the few bright spots
for the Cubs this year. The games
both Friday and Saturday night
will start at 6 :00 p.m.
Saturday night at 8:00 p.m.
the game between undefeated
USC and once-beaten UCLA will
be shown on KTVU-TV Channel
2. Both teams are unbeaten in
conference play and this promises
to be one of the highlights of the
basketball season.

HELP IS ON THE WAYâ€”6-9 Center Mike Mann has been one of the
outstanding front line performers on this year's Stanford freshmen
team. Seen here in action last week against Santa Clara, Mann and
guard John Rigel (3 3) have been two of the reasons for the Papooses'
9-1 record.
