## Tribe Meets UCLA 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's swimming team will
try to extend a four-year winning
streak over UCLA when they
meet the Bruins tomorrow at 2 :0 0
p.m. in the Stanford pool. Both
teams will enter the meet
undefeated.
Three outstanding freshmen
and a junior college transfer have
been added to a veteran UCLA
team which won last year's Pae-8
championship and finished fourth
in the NCAA finals.
UCLA is led by four veteran
per 112 or mers—backstroker and
individual medley specialist Steve
Gentes, distance freestyler Steve
Center, sprinter Dave O'Malley,
and backstroker Steve Doyle.
The three freshmen,
breastroker Tom Brunce,
butterflyer Bernei Stetson, and
sprinter Barry Townsend, and JC
transfer Sonny Gossick will be the
key to the Bruin performance.

Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
had plenty of praise for the
Bruins. "Townsend is a really
great one. He did a 21.1 (50 yd.
free) in high school, and if he
comes within half a second of
that, he'll probably win.
"Doyle and (ienlers are both
fine backstrokers. Both have gone
under two minutes for the 200
backstroke. And Bruce is one of
the best breastrokers in the
nation.
Stanford will be led by NCAA
100 and 200 yd. breastroke
champion Brian Job, NCAA 200
yd. butterfly champion John
Ferris and 1 969 NCAA 100 yard
backstroke champion Fred
Haywood. Sprinter Steve Carey
and distancemen Tim Broderick
and Brent Berk will also be key
Indian performers.
An event which could be
crucial early in the meet, will be
the 4 00 yard medley relay.
Stanford's medley relay team of

Haywood, Job, Ferris, and Carey
won the NCAA finals last year.
And UCLA currently has the
fastest time in the nation.
"The medley relay will be a
very important event," according
to Gaughran. "It will be especially
important in terms of gaining
momentum for the rest of the
meet.
"We really have to win the
diving," said Gaughran. Stanford
has two fine divers in Ted Nichols
and Bill Main, but Gaughran feels
Main may be at a disadvantage
since this will be his first
competitive action of the year.
Gossick is expected to give
Nichols a good battle for first
place.
Gaughran went on to evaluate
the overall picture for tomorrow.
"We can't go on the basis of
comparitive times. We haven't
been pressed like UCLA was
against Washington and thus their
times from that meet are better
than most of ours.
"They'd beat us easily, if we
just compared the best times for
this year. It should be a good
meet and there won't be one
event that won't be closely
contested. It will take a top effort
for us to win."

Haywood. Sprinter Steve Carey
and distancemen Tim Broderick
and Brent Berk will also be key
Indian performers.
An event which could be
crucial early in the meet, will be
the 4 00 yard medley relay.
Stanford's medley relay team of

Haywood, Job, Ferris, and Carey
won the NCAA finals last year.
And UCLA currently has the
fastest time in the nation.
"The medley relay will be a
very important event," according
to Gaughran. "It will be especially
important in terms of gaining
momentum for the rest of the
meet.
"We really have to win the
diving," said Gaughran. Stanford
has two fine divers in Ted Nichols
and Bill Main, but Gaughran feels
Main may be at a disadvantage
since this will be his first
competitive action of the year.
Gossick is expected to give
Nichols a good battle for first
place.
Gaughran went on to evaluate
the overall picture for tomorrow.
"We can't go on the basis of
comparitive times. We haven't
been pressed like UCLA was
against Washington and thus their
times from that meet are better
than most of ours.
"They'd beat us easily, if we
just compared the best times for
this year. It should be a good
meet and there won't be one
event that won't be closely
contested. It will take a top effort
for us to win."
Stanford's swimming team will
try to extend a four-year winning
streak over UCLA when they
meet the Bruins tomorrow at 2 :0 0
p.m. in the Stanford pool. Both
teams will enter the meet
undefeated.
Three outstanding freshmen
and a junior college transfer have
been added to a veteran UCLA
team which won last year's Pae-8
championship and finished fourth
in the NCAA finals.
UCLA is led by four veteran
per 112 or mers—backstroker and
individual medley specialist Steve
Gentes, distance freestyler Steve
Center, sprinter Dave O'Malley,
and backstroker Steve Doyle.
The three freshmen,
breastroker Tom Brunce,
butterflyer Bernei Stetson, and
sprinter Barry Townsend, and JC
transfer Sonny Gossick will be the
key to the Bruin performance.

Stanford coach Jim Gaughran
had plenty of praise for the
Bruins. "Townsend is a really
great one. He did a 21.1 (50 yd.
free) in high school, and if he
comes within half a second of
that, he'll probably win.
"Doyle and (ienlers are both
fine backstrokers. Both have gone
under two minutes for the 200
backstroke. And Bruce is one of
the best breastrokers in the
nation.
Stanford will be led by NCAA
100 and 200 yd. breastroke
champion Brian Job, NCAA 200
yd. butterfly champion John
Ferris and 1 969 NCAA 100 yard
backstroke champion Fred
Haywood. Sprinter Steve Carey
and distancemen Tim Broderick
