# Apollo Moon Landing Successful

SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -
Two more Americans landed on the
moon today in search of clues to the
dawn of the solar system.
Alan B. Shepard and Edgar D.
Mitchell were the third pair of
emissaries from earth to the lifeless
satellite.
They came in the name of science,
hoping that the moon-unchanged by
erosion of air and water-will yield
secrets locked in its soil for nearly five
billion years.
Triumph for Shepard
The triumph of Apollo 14 was a
personal one for Shepard, the country's
first man to brave the hazards of space
nearly 1 0 years ago. And Apollo 1 4 was
challenged to complete the mission of
Apollo 13, unable to land last April
because an oxygen tank exploded in
flight.
The lunar lander Antares, named for
the brightest star in the constellation
Scorpio, settled on the moon at 1:16
a.m. PST.
Sixty miles overhead, girdling the
moon every two hours, was Stuart A.

Roosa, alone in the mothership named
Kitty Hawk.
Antares touched down in the rugged
highlands of Fra Mauro, considered by
scientists to be the most interesting for
exploration because some of its rocks
may be 4.6 billion years old formed in
the birth pangs of the moon.
Moon Walk
Four and one-half hours after
landing, Shepard walks out on the
"porch" of Antares and climbs down
nine steps to the surface. Mitchell
follows minutes later.
They are the fifth and sixth men to
stand on lunar soil, viewing earth from
238,725 miles away. Their footprints
on the moon will be added to those of
Neil A. Armstrong and Edwin E. Aldrin
Jr. of Apollo 11, and Charles Conrad,
Jr. and Alan L. Bean of Apollo 1 2.
During their 33 1/2 hours on the
moon, the spacemen will make two
walks of four to five hours each.
Flight Plan
The flight plan called for Shepard
and Mitchell, to begin the first lunar
excursion 5:33 a.m. PST.
Viewers back home will watch
Shepard and Mitchell set up a
nuclear-powered science station, deploy
several experiments and detonate 21
fire-cracker size explosions on the lunar
surface.
Mitchell also will arm a mortar to
launch grenades on a signal from earth
months after the astronauts leave the
moon.
Moving about the dusty surface in
their bulky protective suits, the
astronauts will follow the tradition of
Apollo 11 and 1 2 explorers and plant
the American flag.
Geological Trip
The second moon walk, to start at
2:38 a.m. Saturday, was set up as a
geology field trip with Shepard and
Mitchell taking the longest hike yet on
the surface, a total ofl 1/2 miles, to
collect rocks, dig trenches and record

magnetic readings at a number of
geologically interesting features.
Their prime scientific target is a
crater called Cone, reachable by
climbing a 400-foot rise. They will pull
with them a two-wheeled, ricksha-like
tool and rock carrier, the first vehicle
man has used on the surface of the
moon.
Linkup Saturday
Blastoff from the moon is scheduled
for 11:47 p.m. Saturday and linkup
with Kitty Hawk at 12:33 p.m. Later

that night the timetable calls for firing
the command module's big engine and
heading for a splashdown in the Pacific
at 1:04 p.m. next Tuesday—after nine
days away from home.
Apollo 14 zipped into lunar orbit at
11 a.m. Thursday and circled for nearly
a day before Antares was released on its
own.
To help improve landing accuracy,
the combined ships dipped to a low
point just 10 miles above the surface
and only 4 0 ,000 feet above jagged
mountain peaks.


CAMPUS CRlME—Crime has once again increased at Stanford. The only area in
which it has decreased is indecent exposure. Maybe because there's less windows.
