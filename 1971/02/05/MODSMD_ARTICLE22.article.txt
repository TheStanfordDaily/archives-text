Blast Damage
OAKLAND — A heavy bomb blast
early yesterday smashed windows and
unhinged doors of the Armed Forces
Induction Center and shook a wide area
of downtown Oakland.
No one was injured but damage
extended over three blocks.
Police said the bomb, planted in or
under a mailbox at the entrance to the
center, was either plastic or
nitroglycerine.
Witnesses said two long-haired
young men were seen running from the
vicinity a few moments before the
12 :35 a.m. explosion.
The induction center, which
processes draftees from all over
Northern California, occupies the first
three floors of the large nine-story
building on Clay Street between
Fifteenth and Sixteenth.
The blast was so powerful that it
broke nearly all windows in the
building and even blew a hole in the
roof cornice high above the mailbox.
Invasion Not Out
WASHINGTON - The White House
yesterday left open the question of
whether South Vietnamese troops may
yet make a major strike into Southern
Laos.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the massing of South Vietnamese
and U.S. forces near the Laotian border
was just "the first phase of that
operation."
And he declared "I'm not going to
project what future troop movements
on the part of the ARVN would be"
when asked if the South Vietnamese
were about to enter Laos with U.S. air
support.
Ziegler also said that the White
House did not pass on the decisions
either to place a news blackout when
the operation began last Saturday, or to
lift it early yesterday.
Ziegler said the judgment to place
the embargo was made by Gen.
Creighton Abrams, U.S. military
commander in South Vietnam, and
added "the fact that there was no loss
of lives in this operation in itself
justifies the judgment of this
commander."
Ziegler reasserted several times over

that no U.S. ground combat forces or
advisers would be allowed into either
Laos or Cambodia.
Deputies Suspended
LOS ANGELES — Sheriff Peter J.
Pitchess announced the firing of three
deputies yesterday for mistreating
prisoners arrested during rioting in East
Los Angeles last Sunday.
In addition, a sergeant was
suspended for failing to prevent the
mistreatment, Pitchess said. The sheriff
said the three deputies were dismissed
for spraying a mace-like chemical on
some prisoners and mishandling two
others. All three were assigned to the
county jail.
Pitchess said Sgt. Robert T. Decker,
39, was suspended for five days for not
taking immediate action against the
deputies.
Dynamite Found
LOS ANGELES — Two dynamite
bombs, taped similarly but one lacking
a fuse, were found within nine hours of
each other on separate college
campuses, authorities reported
yesterday.
The first device, four dynamite
sticks and a fuse, was found late
Wednesday night on a window ledge of
the Martin Luther King Hall at the
California State College at Los Angeles.
It was defused by members of the Los
Angeles Police Deparmtent bomb
squad, who were summoned by campus
police.
Campus police at UCLA found five
sticks of dynamite yesterday morning
while searching a building where a fire
had started earlier. The bomb did not
have a fuse or a blasting cap, and police
said it was unlikely it would have gone
off even if the fire had reached it.
Police were investigating whether
the fire was set with the intention of
igniting the bomb.
Police also were trying to determine
if the two incidents were related.
Rolls Royce
LONDON — Rolls Royce, the
automotive artisans who became the

giant of Britain's aerospace industry,
collapsed Thursday in a sea of red ink.
The government moved to refloat the
company's aviation empire, possibly
with American aid.
Prime Minister Edward Heath was in
touch with President Nixon on rescue
operations. One source said Heath had
received "an understanding American
attitude," but the exchange had at
times been stormy.
The future of the luxurious
Rolls-Royce automobile was uncertain.
Rolls-Royce went on the rocks
under a contract with the Lockheed
company of the United States to build
600 jet engines-a disastrous venture in
which development costs soared to the
point where Rolls-Royce expects to
lose $108 million.
The firm employs 90,000 persons
and is the West's third largest
manufacturer of airplane engines.
Company officials said "no one
knows what is going to happen" to
Rolls-Royce autos. The car division is
highly profitable but accounts for only
5 per cent of the company's
production.
City Hall Scuffle
SAN FRANCISCO - An angry
minority action group scuffled with
police officers yesterday outside Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto's private office.
Two plainclothes officers were
knocked to the floor before other
officers arrived and broke up the brief
fray, a spokesman for the mayor said.
No arrests were made.
Rachel Perez Arce, interim chairman
of the San Francisco Minority Action
Coalition, said her delegation of about
a dozen had become irked at being kept
waiting 4 5 minutes for a 10 a.m.
appointment with Alioto.
They moved into the hallway and
pushed toward his private office a short
time before Alioto had scheduled
announcement of an extensive summer
athletic program for the city's youth.
There will be a special session of the
student senate Tuesday night, February
9, in room 75 of the graduate school of
business. The meeting has been called
to discuss the Asian—American and
Stanford Judicial Council resolutions.

City Hall Scuffle
SAN FRANCISCO - An angry
minority action group scuffled with
police officers yesterday outside Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto's private office.
Two plainclothes officers were
knocked to the floor before other
officers arrived and broke up the brief
fray, a spokesman for the mayor said.
No arrests were made.
Rachel Perez Arce, interim chairman
of the San Francisco Minority Action
Coalition, said her delegation of about
a dozen had become irked at being kept
waiting 4 5 minutes for a 10 a.m.
appointment with Alioto.
They moved into the hallway and
pushed toward his private office a short
time before Alioto had scheduled
announcement of an extensive summer
athletic program for the city's youth.
There will be a special session of the
student senate Tuesday night, February
9, in room 75 of the graduate school of
business. The meeting has been called
to discuss the Asian—American and
Stanford Judicial Council resolutions.
Blast Damage
OAKLAND — A heavy bomb blast
early yesterday smashed windows and
unhinged doors of the Armed Forces
Induction Center and shook a wide area
of downtown Oakland.
No one was injured but damage
extended over three blocks.
Police said the bomb, planted in or
under a mailbox at the entrance to the
center, was either plastic or
nitroglycerine.
Witnesses said two long-haired
young men were seen running from the
vicinity a few moments before the
12 :35 a.m. explosion.
The induction center, which
processes draftees from all over
Northern California, occupies the first
three floors of the large nine-story
building on Clay Street between
Fifteenth and Sixteenth.
The blast was so powerful that it
broke nearly all windows in the
building and even blew a hole in the
roof cornice high above the mailbox.
Invasion Not Out
WASHINGTON - The White House
yesterday left open the question of
whether South Vietnamese troops may
yet make a major strike into Southern
Laos.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the massing of South Vietnamese
and U.S. forces near the Laotian border
was just "the first phase of that
operation."
And he declared "I'm not going to
project what future troop movements
on the part of the ARVN would be"
when asked if the South Vietnamese
were about to enter Laos with U.S. air
support.
Ziegler also said that the White
House did not pass on the decisions
either to place a news blackout when
the operation began last Saturday, or to
lift it early yesterday.
Ziegler said the judgment to place
the embargo was made by Gen.
Creighton Abrams, U.S. military
commander in South Vietnam, and
added "the fact that there was no loss
of lives in this operation in itself
justifies the judgment of this
commander."
Ziegler reasserted several times over

that no U.S. ground combat forces or
advisers would be allowed into either
Laos or Cambodia.
Deputies Suspended
LOS ANGELES — Sheriff Peter J.
Pitchess announced the firing of three
deputies yesterday for mistreating
prisoners arrested during rioting in East
Los Angeles last Sunday.
In addition, a sergeant was
suspended for failing to prevent the
mistreatment, Pitchess said. The sheriff
said the three deputies were dismissed
for spraying a mace-like chemical on
some prisoners and mishandling two
others. All three were assigned to the
county jail.
Pitchess said Sgt. Robert T. Decker,
39, was suspended for five days for not
taking immediate action against the
deputies.
Dynamite Found
LOS ANGELES — Two dynamite
bombs, taped similarly but one lacking
a fuse, were found within nine hours of
each other on separate college
campuses, authorities reported
yesterday.
The first device, four dynamite
sticks and a fuse, was found late
Wednesday night on a window ledge of
the Martin Luther King Hall at the
California State College at Los Angeles.
It was defused by members of the Los
Angeles Police Deparmtent bomb
squad, who were summoned by campus
police.
Campus police at UCLA found five
sticks of dynamite yesterday morning
while searching a building where a fire
had started earlier. The bomb did not
have a fuse or a blasting cap, and police
said it was unlikely it would have gone
off even if the fire had reached it.
Police were investigating whether
the fire was set with the intention of
igniting the bomb.
Police also were trying to determine
if the two incidents were related.
Rolls Royce
LONDON — Rolls Royce, the
automotive artisans who became the

giant of Britain's aerospace industry,
collapsed Thursday in a sea of red ink.
The government moved to refloat the
company's aviation empire, possibly
with American aid.
Prime Minister Edward Heath was in
touch with President Nixon on rescue
operations. One source said Heath had
received "an understanding American
attitude," but the exchange had at
times been stormy.
The future of the luxurious
Rolls-Royce automobile was uncertain.
Rolls-Royce went on the rocks
under a contract with the Lockheed
company of the United States to build
600 jet engines-a disastrous venture in
which development costs soared to the
point where Rolls-Royce expects to
lose $108 million.
The firm employs 90,000 persons
and is the West's third largest
manufacturer of airplane engines.
Company officials said "no one
knows what is going to happen" to
Rolls-Royce autos. The car division is
highly profitable but accounts for only
5 per cent of the company's
production.

Rolls Royce
LONDON — Rolls Royce, the
automotive artisans who became the

giant of Britain's aerospace industry,
collapsed Thursday in a sea of red ink.
The government moved to refloat the
company's aviation empire, possibly
with American aid.
Prime Minister Edward Heath was in
touch with President Nixon on rescue
operations. One source said Heath had
received "an understanding American
attitude," but the exchange had at
times been stormy.
The future of the luxurious
Rolls-Royce automobile was uncertain.
Rolls-Royce went on the rocks
under a contract with the Lockheed
company of the United States to build
600 jet engines-a disastrous venture in
which development costs soared to the
point where Rolls-Royce expects to
lose $108 million.
The firm employs 90,000 persons
and is the West's third largest
manufacturer of airplane engines.
Company officials said "no one
knows what is going to happen" to
Rolls-Royce autos. The car division is
highly profitable but accounts for only
5 per cent of the company's
production.
City Hall Scuffle
SAN FRANCISCO - An angry
minority action group scuffled with
police officers yesterday outside Mayor
Joseph L. Alioto's private office.
Two plainclothes officers were
knocked to the floor before other
officers arrived and broke up the brief
fray, a spokesman for the mayor said.
No arrests were made.
Rachel Perez Arce, interim chairman
of the San Francisco Minority Action
Coalition, said her delegation of about
a dozen had become irked at being kept
waiting 4 5 minutes for a 10 a.m.
appointment with Alioto.
They moved into the hallway and
pushed toward his private office a short
time before Alioto had scheduled
announcement of an extensive summer
athletic program for the city's youth.
There will be a special session of the
student senate Tuesday night, February
9, in room 75 of the graduate school of
business. The meeting has been called
to discuss the Asian—American and
Stanford Judicial Council resolutions.
Blast Damage
OAKLAND — A heavy bomb blast
early yesterday smashed windows and
unhinged doors of the Armed Forces
Induction Center and shook a wide area
of downtown Oakland.
No one was injured but damage
extended over three blocks.
Police said the bomb, planted in or
under a mailbox at the entrance to the
center, was either plastic or
nitroglycerine.
Witnesses said two long-haired
young men were seen running from the
vicinity a few moments before the
12 :35 a.m. explosion.
The induction center, which
processes draftees from all over
Northern California, occupies the first
three floors of the large nine-story
building on Clay Street between
Fifteenth and Sixteenth.
The blast was so powerful that it
broke nearly all windows in the
building and even blew a hole in the
roof cornice high above the mailbox.
Invasion Not Out
WASHINGTON - The White House
yesterday left open the question of
whether South Vietnamese troops may
yet make a major strike into Southern
Laos.
Press secretary Ronald L. Ziegler
said the massing of South Vietnamese
and U.S. forces near the Laotian border
was just "the first phase of that
operation."
And he declared "I'm not going to
project what future troop movements
on the part of the ARVN would be"
when asked if the South Vietnamese
were about to enter Laos with U.S. air
support.
Ziegler also said that the White
House did not pass on the decisions
either to place a news blackout when
the operation began last Saturday, or to
lift it early yesterday.
Ziegler said the judgment to place
the embargo was made by Gen.
Creighton Abrams, U.S. military
commander in South Vietnam, and
added "the fact that there was no loss
of lives in this operation in itself
justifies the judgment of this
commander."
Ziegler reasserted several times over

that no U.S. ground combat forces or
advisers would be allowed into either
Laos or Cambodia.
Deputies Suspended
LOS ANGELES — Sheriff Peter J.
Pitchess announced the firing of three
deputies yesterday for mistreating
prisoners arrested during rioting in East
Los Angeles last Sunday.
In addition, a sergeant was
suspended for failing to prevent the
mistreatment, Pitchess said. The sheriff
said the three deputies were dismissed
for spraying a mace-like chemical on
some prisoners and mishandling two
others. All three were assigned to the
county jail.
Pitchess said Sgt. Robert T. Decker,
39, was suspended for five days for not
taking immediate action against the
deputies.
Dynamite Found
LOS ANGELES — Two dynamite
bombs, taped similarly but one lacking
a fuse, were found within nine hours of
each other on separate college
campuses, authorities reported
yesterday.
The first device, four dynamite
sticks and a fuse, was found late
Wednesday night on a window ledge of
the Martin Luther King Hall at the
California State College at Los Angeles.
It was defused by members of the Los
Angeles Police Deparmtent bomb
squad, who were summoned by campus
police.
Campus police at UCLA found five
sticks of dynamite yesterday morning
while searching a building where a fire
had started earlier. The bomb did not
have a fuse or a blasting cap, and police
said it was unlikely it would have gone
off even if the fire had reached it.
Police were investigating whether
the fire was set with the intention of
igniting the bomb.
Police also were trying to determine
if the two incidents were related.
