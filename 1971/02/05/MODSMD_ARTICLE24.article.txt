### 
Hayes Appointed
Denis Hayes, former student body
president here and presently the
youngest member of Stanford's Board
of Trustees, was named to a new panel
to study the plight of the cities, the
New York Times reported yesterday.
The panel, called the National Urban
Coalition's Commission on the Cities in
the 70's will be co-chaired by Mayor
John Lindsay of New York, and
Senator Fred R. Harris of Oklahoma
and will visit six cities in the next three
months, in order to determine whether
the 1968 report of the National
Advisory Commission on Civil
Disorders has been implemented.
Lindsay and Harris agreed today
that they believed the Kerner
Commission's report had not been
implemented.
Hayes, 26, is presently the national
coordinator of Environmental Action,
which sponsored Earth Day last April.
He graduated from Stanford in 1969.
SJC Hearing Set
The Stanford Judicial Council
announced tonight that the next
hearing of the case involving students
charged with disrupting Henry Cabot
Lodge will be held on Tuesday, at
12:30 p.m. in Physics 101. Admission
of spectators will be restricted to a
limited number of persons selected by
the defendants, the University
Administration, or the Council.
It is anticipated that the hearing will
be carried live on radio station KZSU

and that some 300 to 350 persons will
be able to follow the proceedings from
a nearby room on closed circuit
television.
Prison Program
Prison reform is a subject many
discuss, but few are actually able to
help to bring about. Officials of the
penal system are often guarded in their
response to public criticism and rarely
open to new ideas or suggestions,
especially from the academic
community.
However, university students and
faculty have now been invited to visit,
teach, and conduct research studies in
the San Mateo County penal system by
Robert Harrison of the San Mateo
County Service League.
Students wishing to obtain credit for
work at the Work-Furlough Center in
Redwood City and the Sheriff's Honor
Camp at Page Mill Road and Skyline,
should contact the student center
(SCIRE), x 4504.
Officials at the sites are willing to
consider developing new concepts of
crime and penology. Students are
currently involved in counciling
projects at the Sheriff's Honor Camp.
The program offers a wide spectrum
for interdisciplinary work in such fields
as political science, law, education,
sociology, and others.
Plans for any new project starting
spring quarter must be submitted to the
SCIRE office within the next few
weeks.

Prison Program
Prison reform is a subject many
discuss, but few are actually able to
help to bring about. Officials of the
penal system are often guarded in their
response to public criticism and rarely
open to new ideas or suggestions,
especially from the academic
community.
However, university students and
faculty have now been invited to visit,
teach, and conduct research studies in
the San Mateo County penal system by
Robert Harrison of the San Mateo
County Service League.
Students wishing to obtain credit for
work at the Work-Furlough Center in
Redwood City and the Sheriff's Honor
Camp at Page Mill Road and Skyline,
should contact the student center
(SCIRE), x 4504.
Officials at the sites are willing to
consider developing new concepts of
crime and penology. Students are
currently involved in counciling
projects at the Sheriff's Honor Camp.
The program offers a wide spectrum
for interdisciplinary work in such fields
as political science, law, education,
sociology, and others.
Plans for any new project starting
spring quarter must be submitted to the
SCIRE office within the next few
weeks.
