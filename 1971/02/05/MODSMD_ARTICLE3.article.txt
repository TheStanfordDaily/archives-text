# Opposition To War Voiced At Meeting
## 
### 
Strong vocal opposition to the
possible expansion of the Indochina
War into Laos was voiced last night at a
community meeting sponsored by the
Coalition Against the War in Indochina.
Jim Shoch's facetious imitation of
• Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
defending the U.S. involvement in
Indochina drew the most enthusiastic
reaction from the Memorial
Auditorium crowd of 4 00 during the
slow-moving two and a half hour
meeting.
Calls for direct group action to
protest the Allied operations
announced today drew little response
from the quiet crowd.
Gerry Foote, one of the defendants
in the Lodge disruption SJC trial who
co-sponsored the meeting, again stated
that the next hearing scheduled for
12:30 Tuesday, "will be an open
hearing" although University officials
maintain that only invited guests will
be allowed to attend.
She reported the demands of the
defendants announced Tuesday: that
the contempt suspensions for four of

the defendants be dropped, that Law
Prof. Howard Williams be dismissed as
chairman of the SJC, and that all
charges resulting from the Lodge
speech disruption be dismissed.
The meeting lived up to its billing as
an informational meeting with Banning
Garrett discussing the growing U.S.
involvement in Indochina and its
frustration in meeting little military
success, Katherine Barkley outlining
how the "war is being waged from this
very University," and Joel Yudkin
discussing how much of the Defense
Department research on campus is
directly related to the war effort.
Garrett suggested that if the current
Allied offensive is not successful in
destroying Viet Cong and North
Vietnamese forces, the U.S. might use
tactical nuclear weapons, in particular,
nuclear land mines on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail.
Most proposals for action centered
around organizing the community in
opposition to the War. Many speakers
suggested ways to try to "build a
movement" similar to last spring's
opposition to the Cambodian invasion.
