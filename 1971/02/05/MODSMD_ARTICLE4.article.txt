## Student Foodstamp Use Rises 
### TOM PAULU 
The federal food stamp program is
being used by a growing number of
college students, according to surveys
taken around the country.
But according to welfare officials,
the program in which food stamps
purchased from a welfare department
are redeemable for a much higher value
at some grocery stores, is not meant for
use by students. The ease with which a
student can obtain food stamps
therefore varies from one area—with
one set of welfare workers—to another.
Each county in California has its
own welfare system, and in Santa Clara
County, of which Stanford is a part,
about 700 students are receiving food
stamps. This is 2 per cent of the total
number of food stamp recipients in the
county, the same figure as for San
Francisco county. No records are
available as to the number of Stanford
students on the program.
In order to get stamps here, one
must present a welfare official with
information about one's financial status
such as wage stubs, rent receipts, and
utilities receipts. Students, must
indicate how much financial aid they
get, if any, and if they are under 21,
their parents must state that they have
withdrawn support.
Not Hard to (let
The general feeling among students
who get food stamps here is that they
aren't unreasonably difficult to get. A
female Stanford senior living in an
apartment said she has "no trouble"
getting into the program. Each month.

she buys food stamps for $1. They are
then redeemable for $28 worth of
food.
Russell Pow, director of the food
stamp program here, indicated that the
fact that one is a student does not in
itself lessen one's chances of getting the
stamps. He stated that need is
determined according to Department of
Agriculture standards, under which a
single person whose net income per
month is less than $185 is eligible for
stamps.
According to Mr. Pow, stamps can't
be given to someone who is sharing
food with other people. Thus,
difficulties can arise when a person who
lives with people to whom he isn't
related applies for stamps. A Stanford
girl who otherwise met the
requirements could not get stamps
because one of the men in her
apartment had $1 000 in the bank. He
claimed he had no intnetio
supporting her.
Welfare Getting Stricter
A worker at the Free U. said that
the welfare department is "starting to
get pretty strict" about giving out
stamps, although she thought it is easier
to get stamps here than in San Mateo
County.
Mr. Pow does not strongly feel that
students here are cheating on the
program. He stressed that the chief
injustice is the failure of food stamp
recipients to report new circumstances
such as having moved, living with a
different number of people, or, for
students, dropping out of school. "It's

not just students who give us these
problems," he emphasized.
Some welfare officials in the
country have said that students, and
especially ones at private institutions
should not get the stamps. "If they can
go to college, they can get the money,"
insisted a New Jersey worker. But the
last word is that uttered by a New
Mexico official who pointed out that
"If getting stamps allows them to go to
school and become earners, they are
going to pay it back very shortly in
taxes."

girl who otherwise met the
requirements could not get stamps
because one of the men in her
apartment had $1 000 in the bank. He
claimed he had no intnetio
supporting her.
Welfare Getting Stricter
A worker at the Free U. said that
the welfare department is "starting to
get pretty strict" about giving out
stamps, although she thought it is easier
to get stamps here than in San Mateo
County.
Mr. Pow does not strongly feel that
students here are cheating on the
program. He stressed that the chief
injustice is the failure of food stamp
recipients to report new circumstances
such as having moved, living with a
different number of people, or, for
students, dropping out of school. "It's

not just students who give us these
problems," he emphasized.
Some welfare officials in the
country have said that students, and
especially ones at private institutions
should not get the stamps. "If they can
go to college, they can get the money,"
insisted a New Jersey worker. But the
last word is that uttered by a New
Mexico official who pointed out that
"If getting stamps allows them to go to
school and become earners, they are
going to pay it back very shortly in
taxes."
The federal food stamp program is
being used by a growing number of
college students, according to surveys
taken around the country.
But according to welfare officials,
the program in which food stamps
purchased from a welfare department
are redeemable for a much higher value
at some grocery stores, is not meant for
use by students. The ease with which a
student can obtain food stamps
therefore varies from one area—with
one set of welfare workers—to another.
Each county in California has its
own welfare system, and in Santa Clara
County, of which Stanford is a part,
about 700 students are receiving food
stamps. This is 2 per cent of the total
number of food stamp recipients in the
county, the same figure as for San
Francisco county. No records are
available as to the number of Stanford
students on the program.
In order to get stamps here, one
must present a welfare official with
information about one's financial status
such as wage stubs, rent receipts, and
utilities receipts. Students, must
indicate how much financial aid they
get, if any, and if they are under 21,
their parents must state that they have
withdrawn support.
Not Hard to (let
The general feeling among students
who get food stamps here is that they
aren't unreasonably difficult to get. A
female Stanford senior living in an
apartment said she has "no trouble"
getting into the program. Each month.

she buys food stamps for $1. They are
then redeemable for $28 worth of
food.
Russell Pow, director of the food
stamp program here, indicated that the
fact that one is a student does not in
itself lessen one's chances of getting the
stamps. He stated that need is
determined according to Department of
Agriculture standards, under which a
single person whose net income per
month is less than $185 is eligible for
stamps.
According to Mr. Pow, stamps can't
be given to someone who is sharing
food with other people. Thus,
difficulties can arise when a person who
lives with people to whom he isn't
related applies for stamps. A Stanford
girl who otherwise met the
requirements could not get stamps
because one of the men in her
apartment had $1 000 in the bank. He
claimed he had no intnetio
