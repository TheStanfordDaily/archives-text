# University Concerned Over Budget
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER (First in a Series) 
Money. Funding. These are factors omnipresent in
the University's everyday life. Nevertheless, for most
of the two decades following World War 11, they
received little more than cursory attention from the
University community as a whole.
Funding and its worries were the province of the
President and his tinancial officers.
Things have changed.
Caught in a time of nationwide fiscal uncertainty,
with the rate of increase in income on the decline,
and the cost of expenditures sharply on the rise,
Stanford has had to take a close look at its budget.
President Richard W. Lyman has stated that $6
million will be cut from the budget by 1 9 75.
And, looking even farther ahead, the long-run
financial future of higher education is not bright. For,
as Lyman told the Academic Council last month, "We
cannot expect a resumption of the startling increases
we knew up until a couple of years ago in the
percentage of the nation's wealth allocated to higher
education year after year."
Results
An immediate result of the financial crisis is the
greatly heightened interest of the entire University
community in it's financial problems and in it's
budget decision-making process.
This interest necessitates an understanding of the
circuitous routes that money here travels - where ii
comes from, where it goes, and why.
All the money which the University u.'ies daily em
be classified in two broad categories - restricted funds
and unrestricted funds.
The unrestricted funds, which become part of the
University's operating budget, «iro made up of tuition
and fees, expendable gifts - any gift which either is
completely unrestricted or- restricted only to a
particular school ,!r;• pnH income on
endowments which have been de.siunat ' 112

expendable for any purpose. Some funds in this
category are also restricted to a particular school or
department.
Seventy-five percent of this budget goes to
supporting programs within the University
professors' salaries, the cost of library' booVs, and
similar costs - while 25% is used in funding the
services for these programs. According to Kenneth
Creighton, Deputy Vice-President for Finance here,
the operating budget is intended "to support the
ongoing expenditures of the central purposes of the
University - with the exception of organized
research."
Research a Central Purpose
Creighton explained that, while organized research
is paid for through restricted funds, it should not bo
considered as less of a "central purpose" than those
programs funded through the operating buoget.
He defined the central purposes of thi University
as instruction, departmental research, i.nd certain
elements of public service which the University (an
offer to the surrounding community.
Income in the second category, restricted funds
accounted for more than three times a.* much ircome
as the category of unrestricted funds in 1 970. The
largest single category of the restricted income
includes contracts and grants for sponsored research
and training at Stanford.
The largest single contributor to t!iis category is
the federal government. Among other donors are such
private foundations as the Ford, Carnegie, and
Rockefellers foundations, and the American Heart
Associal ion.
"The govern men I gives to suppor' a certain
program," noted llussell Worley, Budget Manager
liere. "Generally speaking, ;ill government contracts
and grants result from someone in the university
making a request."
Student Aid
A second prominent category of restricted income
is income for student aid, which can come from

endowment income, gifts* and government grants. All
aid to students is restricted, with the exception of
$600,000 on the undergraduate level and
$1 1 ,000,000 on the graduate level.
(lifts intended for student aid may be turned
down if the Universi y considers them too restrictive.
In late Spring of 1 969 , the University stopped
accepting Pennsylvania State Scholarships, when a
stipulation was attached that any university accepting
the funds had to report on o ihe state on the
activities of students receiving the funds.
"No gift tells us what to do," explained Raymond
Bacchetti, Associate Provost and head of the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Nevertheless, donors may express preferences as to
which categories of students may receive funds.
According to Russell Worley, Budget Manager at
Stanford, the trustees will try to honor requests of
donors, as long as the request is flexible.
For instance, if a donor wished his money to aid
boy scouts from Utah, the trustees and financial
officers would Iry to insure that nil students accepted
to Stanford who fitted the description received funds.
But if not enough students qualified for that category
to use up all the scholarship money, it could be used
for other students who were not boy scouts from
Utah.
Auxiliary Operations
A third sector of restricted funds is comprised of
funds which support auxiliary operations. The
amount which the University actually has to
contribute to these auxiliary operations which
include Tresidder Union's second floor, the Stanford
Hospital, Ihe Stanford Press, Residences and the
Food Service, the Athletic Department, and the
Computation ('enter • is small, since all are virtually
self-support ing.
(The sccond part of the series will discuss where
funds ore allocated, and how.)

similar costs - while 25% is used in funding the
services for these programs. According to Kenneth
Creighton, Deputy Vice-President for Finance here,
the operating budget is intended "to support the
ongoing expenditures of the central purposes of the
University - with the exception of organized
research."
Research a Central Purpose
Creighton explained that, while organized research
is paid for through restricted funds, it should not bo
considered as less of a "central purpose" than those
programs funded through the operating buoget.
He defined the central purposes of thi University
as instruction, departmental research, i.nd certain
elements of public service which the University (an
offer to the surrounding community.
Income in the second category, restricted funds
accounted for more than three times a.* much ircome
as the category of unrestricted funds in 1 970. The
largest single category of the restricted income
includes contracts and grants for sponsored research
and training at Stanford.
The largest single contributor to t!iis category is
the federal government. Among other donors are such
private foundations as the Ford, Carnegie, and
Rockefellers foundations, and the American Heart
Associal ion.
"The govern men I gives to suppor' a certain
program," noted llussell Worley, Budget Manager
liere. "Generally speaking, ;ill government contracts
and grants result from someone in the university
making a request."
Student Aid
A second prominent category of restricted income
is income for student aid, which can come from

endowment income, gifts* and government grants. All
aid to students is restricted, with the exception of
$600,000 on the undergraduate level and
$1 1 ,000,000 on the graduate level.
(lifts intended for student aid may be turned
down if the Universi y considers them too restrictive.
In late Spring of 1 969 , the University stopped
accepting Pennsylvania State Scholarships, when a
stipulation was attached that any university accepting
the funds had to report on o ihe state on the
activities of students receiving the funds.
"No gift tells us what to do," explained Raymond
Bacchetti, Associate Provost and head of the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Nevertheless, donors may express preferences as to
which categories of students may receive funds.
According to Russell Worley, Budget Manager at
Stanford, the trustees will try to honor requests of
donors, as long as the request is flexible.
For instance, if a donor wished his money to aid
boy scouts from Utah, the trustees and financial
officers would Iry to insure that nil students accepted
to Stanford who fitted the description received funds.
But if not enough students qualified for that category
to use up all the scholarship money, it could be used
for other students who were not boy scouts from
Utah.
Auxiliary Operations
A third sector of restricted funds is comprised of
funds which support auxiliary operations. The
amount which the University actually has to
contribute to these auxiliary operations which
include Tresidder Union's second floor, the Stanford
Hospital, Ihe Stanford Press, Residences and the
Food Service, the Athletic Department, and the
Computation ('enter • is small, since all are virtually
self-support ing.
(The sccond part of the series will discuss where
funds ore allocated, and how.)
Money. Funding. These are factors omnipresent in
the University's everyday life. Nevertheless, for most
of the two decades following World War 11, they
received little more than cursory attention from the
University community as a whole.
Funding and its worries were the province of the
President and his tinancial officers.
Things have changed.
Caught in a time of nationwide fiscal uncertainty,
with the rate of increase in income on the decline,
and the cost of expenditures sharply on the rise,
Stanford has had to take a close look at its budget.
President Richard W. Lyman has stated that $6
million will be cut from the budget by 1 9 75.
And, looking even farther ahead, the long-run
financial future of higher education is not bright. For,
as Lyman told the Academic Council last month, "We
cannot expect a resumption of the startling increases
we knew up until a couple of years ago in the
percentage of the nation's wealth allocated to higher
education year after year."
Results
An immediate result of the financial crisis is the
greatly heightened interest of the entire University
community in it's financial problems and in it's
budget decision-making process.
This interest necessitates an understanding of the
circuitous routes that money here travels - where ii
comes from, where it goes, and why.
All the money which the University u.'ies daily em
be classified in two broad categories - restricted funds
and unrestricted funds.
The unrestricted funds, which become part of the
University's operating budget, «iro made up of tuition
and fees, expendable gifts - any gift which either is
completely unrestricted or- restricted only to a
particular school ,!r;• pnH income on
endowments which have been de.siunat ' 112

expendable for any purpose. Some funds in this
category are also restricted to a particular school or
department.
Seventy-five percent of this budget goes to
supporting programs within the University
professors' salaries, the cost of library' booVs, and
similar costs - while 25% is used in funding the
services for these programs. According to Kenneth

"No gift tells us what to do," explained Raymond
Bacchetti, Associate Provost and head of the Budget
Adjustment Program.
Nevertheless, donors may express preferences as to
which categories of students may receive funds.
According to Russell Worley, Budget Manager at
Stanford, the trustees will try to honor requests of
donors, as long as the request is flexible.
For instance, if a donor wished his money to aid
boy scouts from Utah, the trustees and financial
officers would Iry to insure that nil students accepted
to Stanford who fitted the description received funds.
But if not enough students qualified for that category
to use up all the scholarship money, it could be used
for other students who were not boy scouts from
Utah.
Auxiliary Operations
A third sector of restricted funds is comprised of
funds which support auxiliary operations. The
amount which the University actually has to
contribute to these auxiliary operations which
include Tresidder Union's second floor, the Stanford
Hospital, Ihe Stanford Press, Residences and the
Food Service, the Athletic Department, and the
Computation ('enter • is small, since all are virtually
self-support ing.
(The sccond part of the series will discuss where
funds ore allocated, and how.)
