# accept defeat than escalation
## Last Stop Before Nuclear Weapons? 
### 
Secretary Rogers said last week
that "Vietnamization" is in its
most "critical phase." Rogers was
quite accurate, though he failed to
explain that the U.S. position was
deteriorating all over Indochina.
The failure of Nixon's
Vietnamization was dramatically
demonstrated by the National
United Front attacks on Phnom
Penh two weeks ago. The
Cambodian Air Force was 95 pel
cent destroyed by about forty
guerrillas, and more significantly,
there were bombings in Phnom
Penh carried out by a clandestine
network within the city (Le
Monde 29 January 1971). Thus,
not only is more than half the
country in the hands of the NUF,
backed by the NLF and North
Vietnamese, and the rest of the
ci untryside only under nominal
control of the U.S. backed Lon
Nol regime, but even the capital is
insecure from both external and
internal attacks. For all the
massive U.S. air power, the U.S.
trained Cambodian mercenaries,
the U.S. military aid

"non-advisors," and the Saigon
ground troops, the U. S. is losing
in Cambodia.
In Laos, the CIA mercenary
army has been nearly destroyed
(the average age of the recruits is
now 15, and the size of the army
is down from 5 0,000 to about
10,000—5,000 of whom are
ethnic from Thailand recruited
and trained by the CIA). In the
last few days the Fathet Lao have
launched an offensive which has
taken them to the western end of
the Plain of Jars, where they have
taken the American city-base of
Muong Soui. They now threaten
to take the major American base
in Laos, Long Cheng, which is the
CIA —Armee Clandestine
headquarters.
Although there has been
relatively little ground combat in
South Vietnam, the political
situation is rapidly deteriorating
for the U.S. and for Thieu and
Ky. The urban opposition to the
U. S., led by the radical, powerful
Student Union, is gaining
tremendous support from the

urban population for their
demands for total withdrawal of
all U. S. personnel and U. S.
support for the Thieu-Ky regime,
and for immediate negotiations
with the NLF. The South
Vietnamese Army (ARVN) is no
nearer to being a military force
able to maintain U. S. control
after withdrawal of U.S. ground
troops is to be completed this
spring. And the morale of the U.
S. troops is reportedly mutinous.
Nixon's only hope for
defeating the Indochinese
liberation forces in Cambodia and
South Vietnam is to isolate them
from outside supplies as well as to
isolate them from the rest of the
population by "forced
urbanization." The Cambodian
coup and subsequent invasion was
intended to cut off the supply
lines to South Vietnam, but that
operation backfired when the
Cambodian peasants rose in
revolutionary opposition to Lon
Nol. And the 'sanctuaries'
destroyed by the U. S. invasion
have been rebuilt and reoccupied
(Le Monde 1 7 October 70).

For 117 days the U.S. has been
bombing North Vietnamese
supply lines along the Ho Chi
Minh trail area of southern Laos
with about 30 B-5 2's and 3 00 to
5 00 fighter bombers per day—or
3,000 to 4 ,000 tons of bombs per
day—or the equivalent of one
Hiroshima size bomb every three
days. But this massive assault
against the Trail has failed to halt
the flow of men and supplies to
South Vietnam.
Thus an invasion of
Laos—which seems likely—is a
logical escalation to salvage the
remnants of Vietnamization. Such
an invasion, however, will prove
to be vastly more difficult than
the invasion of Cambodia bearily
mountainous (nearly impossible
for a mechanized army) and
because the North Vietnamese
and Pathet Lao are extremely well
entrenched and prepared for such
an attack. An allied invasion of
Laos may force the hand of the
Laotian right wing for a Lon
Nol-style coup, possibly led by
the old CIA stand-by, Phoumi
Nosavan.
And an invasion of Laos will
fail to achieve Nixon's "just
peace," thus again forcing Nixon
to chose between escalation or
total withdrawal. The critical
period should lie in the next few
months. An invasion may well be
the last stop before the ultimate
technological solution to the
collapse of the 25 year effort to
win over the people of Vietnam to
the American order: nuclear
attack. Nixon could, for example
use tactical nuclear weapons on
the Trail and below the DMZ to
isolate the NLF permanently with

banning garrett

a radioactive barrier. Such an
escalation would be consistent
with the Vietnamization--
urbanization strategy. 1 wrote last
November of the development of
atomic land mines and of the
pressures for their use. Rumors
are that these pressures are
increasing and that this spring or
sooner will be the time for the
crucial decision.
The anti-war, anti-imperialist
forces in the U.S. must force
Nixon to accept defeat rather
than to escalate.
