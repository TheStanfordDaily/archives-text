## A 						Split In The Right Wing 
### 
This is the question many
thoughtful people are asking as
they hear reports of an impending
decision to send many thousands
of troops to Laos. They ask how
they can be effective in preventing
another escalation in Indochina.
As one who served in the State
Department during the first year
of the Nixon Administration, I
can tell you truthfully that there
are many people in our
government who want an end to
this war. They need your support.
What kind of support would
help them most? I can tell you
first the things that won't: any
type of violence, confrontation,
or strike puts anti-war people in

Washington on the defensive.
Such activity plays right into the
hands of the Spiro Agnews of this
administration.
How can you help? Not by
raising moral issues, no matter
how valid they may be. The
Nixon Administration, like most
governments I know, does not
respond well to such arguments.
Foreign policy arguments don't
cut much ice, either. People in the
State Department have been
making such a case for a long
time, but most of us know State
(and its arguments) has little clout
when key decisions are made.
What, then, can be effective?
What are the things to which the

Jerome tuccille

Nixon Administration would
respond, both now and
throughout the spring? One big
thing is money. Major-party
politics require money, lots of it.
How does that fact relate to Laos
or Vietnam? It's easy, if you think
about it a bit. Whether you like it
or not, you are the sons and
daughters of the establishment.
Your parents and relatives are
corporation presidents, university
executives, important lawyers,
doctors, etc. They are people who
count in this country. They also
provide the money which keeps
our major parties going.
I suggest this: call your parents
tonight. Tell them how you feel
about our saturation bombing of
Laos and Cambodia. Level with
them. Tell them the effect this
war has had on you and your
friends. Tell them what effect this
war has had on your confidence in
our society and democratic
institutions. Tell them what
impact its continuance will likely
have on your willingness to
support an internationalist foreign
policy.
Above all, tell your parents
that they have the power to
influence this decision. Tell them
to call Johi) Ehrlichman at the
White House tomorrow and
express their concern over a move
into Laos would mean for this
campus and for the ultimate faith
of our students in democratic
institutions.
Tell them to call Robert Dole
and their local Republican
Chairman and inform them that
they won't contribute one cent to
the Republican Party until Nixon
pulls out all U.S. forces from
Indochina. If they are Democrats,
tell them to call Larry O'brien and
say they aren't contributing a
dime to Muskie until he pledges to
do the same.
Make this pledge to yourself.
Vow to call at least one relative or
influential friend per night for the
next few months. These are the
crucial months in Indochina, and
you must keep up the pressure if
you are to succeed.
We all remember the folly of
last spring. So many invested so
much time, with so few results
and with so much that was
counterproductive.
This time, let's be effective.
