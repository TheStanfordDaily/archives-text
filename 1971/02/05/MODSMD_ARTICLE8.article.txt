## Are We Really Powerless? 
### 
When William Buckley and the
National Review crowd injected
evangelical anti-Communism into
right-wing circles the conservatives
found themselves split into two
broad camps: the libertarians who
were very anarchistic on domestic
issues and military isolationists, in
foreign policy; and the Russell
Kirk and William Buckley
traditionalists who saw the
existence of atheistic Communism
as a threat to the religious and
cultural inheritance of the
Western world.
Many libertarians went their
own way, but others embraced
the new fusionism which sought
to draw a bridge between

advocates of individual freedom
on the one hand, and those who
wanted to rid the world of
Communists at any cost on the
other.
William Buckley is upset, it
seems, because The New York
Times Magazine carried articles on
Dec. 6 and Jan. 10 dealing with
the libertarian movement in the
United States, and publicized the
split occurring on the Right
between conservative and
anarcho-libertarian factions. This
is a development Buckley had
hoped to keep under cover,
referring to it, whenever he did, as
a family squabble rather than the
permanent breach it has become.
Chairman Bill's chief
contribution to conservatism has
been to upgrade the quality of its
style. He has managed to cloak his
Roman authoritarianism under
heavy layers of convoluted
verbiage. Because he is so opaque,
so adroit at sidestepping issues, he
is a greater potential threat than
his "plain-spoken" right-wing
colleagues.
Nor is it any longer a question
of libertarians criticizing
conservatives for their
"over-indulgence of state
welfarism." The issue of state
warfafism took precedence over
that one long ago. The
responsibility for the national
disgrace brought about by our
military presence in Southeast

John n. Thomas

Asia now rests just as squarely on
the shoulders of Nixon and Laird
as it ever did on Johnson and
Rusk.
The real issue is the erosion of
Buckley's power base in
right-wing circlesâ€”an erosion that
came into the open with the
defection of Karl Hess to the Left
in late 1968, and gained further
momentum at the Young
Americans for Freedom
convention in St. Louis in the
summer of 1969. Suddenly
Buckley has woken up and
realized that there are elements on
the Right that don't take him
seriously; that there are economic
conservatives in the United States
of America who are not at all
interested in joining his Unholy
Crusade to rid the world of
Communists.
The purpose of this article is to
urge others on the Right, others
who still care about such things as
peace and justice and racial
harmony, to re-evaluate their
status vis-a-vis Buckley-style
conservatism. To re-evaluate and
then support political candidates
who really mean peace when they
say peace; who understand and
intend to promote the politics of
decentralization, of pollution
control, of economic and judicial
reform, and so on all the way
down the line.
