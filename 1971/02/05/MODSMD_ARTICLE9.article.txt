# WHERE DO CORRECT IDEAS GO TO? TO THE EDITOR ...AND TO HER ALONE!

contradiction
Editor, THE DAILY:
Professor Harold Segal ("Lodge
- An Honest Man?") has given us a
conception of free speech that
deserves our close attention
because in one or another
variation it has been used in the
past several weeks to justify the
disruption of Ambassador Lodge's
scheduled speech. It goes
something like this:
1. The right to air ideas in the
University is a conditional right.
The chief condition is that if there
is a good reason not to allow the
right to be exercised, then no
deprivation exists if it is denied.
"... in the present case the
accusation which must be judged,
independent of personalities, is
that Lodge was denied a hearing
without sufficient cause."
It should be noted that
Professor Segal gives us no
standards by which "sufficient
cause" may be judged, nor even a
mechanism for deciding when to
invoke it. In the present case,
however, since Lodge is accused
by some of committing war
crimes, and since no tribunal
exists to hear the charges, "there
can be no alternative but for each
c ;f 'zen concerned with the welfare
of his society to assume
jurisdiction ..."
In the absence of either
standards or procedures, we are
presumably left with brute force
as the final arbiter between my
conception of "sufficient cause"
and his. Apparently this does not
worry Professor Segal because he
does not trouble to give us a
better choice.
2. Whatever one may feel
about the above abstraction,
Lodge was not denied free speech,

nor was his audience denied access
to it, because many other have
already said what Lodge planned
to say.
This proposition might have a
certain attraction if it were given
as advice to that legion of
individuals who appear before the
public without much on their
minds that is new or interesting.
As an argument in support of
forcibly denying individuals the
right to speak and to be heard, it
is, to say the least, bizarre.
3. When a speaker proposes to
speak on a subject about which
some part of his audience does
not want to hear, they are entitled
to prevent him from addressing
ihe others in the audience who
came to hear his talk on that
subject. Thus, if Mr. Lodge had
come to present his defense on
the charge of being a war criminal
and had been prevented from
doing then "... the
accusation of a denial of his
freedom of speech would have at
least been a conceivable
assertion." However, since he did
not choose to appear in that role
but rather, "as the featured
speaker in connection with the

commemoration of the
establishment of the United
Nations!", neither he nor his
audience had any "conceivable"
rights.
I do not believe that I have
done Professor Segal's argument
any injustice by arranging it in
this sequence. Seen in this form it
may appear to be in flat
contradiction to almost 200 years
of experience with the Bill of
Rigiits. I confess that it strikes me
that way. Indeed, it would seem
to me only absurd, were it not for
the possibility that it might be
taken seriously because of the
rhetoric of the higher morality
that surrounds it.

oddities
Editor, THE DAILY:
The singular case of one H.
Bruce Franklin contains several
oddities. The least of which is
Bruce himself—a simple case of
reversion to his childhood
fantasies of himself as Attila the
Hun, dragging the world down to

his level.
Another is that he and his pack
of trained brats are so upset when
the very system he seeks to
destroy threatens to stop
supporting him. "That's not
playing fair," he whines and
squeals. Isn't it? Too weak to
stand on your own, you have to
lean on the man you're stabbing?
Some revolutionary hero you
turned out to be!
A third is the way "Brucie and
the Bratpack" (also known as
Venceremos) keep chanting
slogans like "power to the
people" (the chosen people, with
guess who doing the chosing), or
"Shoot to Kill" as if working
themselves up to some tribalistic
frenzy. A bad imitation of B grade
jungle films—or Nazi
documentaries.
Or, finally, the way they keep
reassuring themselves they will

inevitably win, and the "system"
is doomed. As if those were magic
incantations which come true ii
repeated enough. No, Brucie, if
anything is inevitable, it's that
you, too, shall surely pass- having
nothing more than a few
suspensions or dismissals to
support your martyr fantasy.

confused
Editor, THE DAILY:
I confess I'm somewhat
confused after reading Professor
Drekmeier's letter. I guess the
logic was too difficult to follow
and a lowly student like me has
become meier'd in the krud. In
applying it to my own situation, I
have come to the following
conclusions: 1. On campus I
represent a minority opinion,

different from that of the learned
and logical professor. 2. "It is not
difficult to know"the professor's
"sentiments on an issue; he does
not suffer from lack of a
podium." My "views have a n\ore
difficult time." After all, I have
neither the classroom nor a noble
title and the weight it may carry.
3. Because of this it is my right to
"free expression" and use
"disruption" which "may be seen
as a protest against exclusion
. . . against the cavalier disregard
of the ordinary citizen by the"
professor. 4. Therefore I should
stomp, yell, and disrupt every
lecture, speech, and utterance of
the esteemed professor.
Somehow, however, I don't
have the moral arrogance. 1 feel it
intuitively, not having his supreme
logic, that he should have his say,
and Lodge also. But then, I am a
mere student, so I will express
myself more simply. Up yours,
Charlie.
