Daily Mistake
The disclaimer above the
report of the University
Ombudsman, which ran last
Friday, was incorrect. It
should have read "Publication
of this report financed by the
University." We did not
intend to imply that the
Ombudsman's report was an
advertisement, nor that his
office is connected in any
way with the University
Relations Service.
