## Arguments Against The Draft 
### 
George mcgovern

Any careful analysis of the draft,
and there have been a number in recent
years, leaves one wondering how it has
managed to hang on so Its
justifications smack more of fable than
of fact, and it is repugnant to nearly
every shade of American political
philosophy—from Barry Goldwater to
George McGovern, and further at both
ends.
A nation founded on human liberty
and individual dignity, and peopled in
good part by escapees from compulsion
in other lands, should have a natural
distaste for conscription. We have in
fact„, decided once through the
devastation of civil war that freedom
and involuntary servitude cannot
coexist. On principle, the draft is as
foreign as anything can be to the ideals
we profess as a free, libertarian society.
Thus, for most of our history we
have rejected it unless our national
survival itself has been at stake. It was
first used sparingly during the Civil War
and has never been employed, until the
last two decades, except in cases of war
duly declared by the Congress.
As had always been the case, the
draft expired again after World War 11.
But the respite was brief. After a
pervasive Pentagon campaign exploiting
fear of the Soviet Union—our World
War II ally turned cold war
adversary—the Congress in 1948
adopted the country's first peacetime
draft. It has remained, even though the
belief that gave it birth—that land war
with Russia was imminent, leaving no
time for mobilization—has long since
grown stale and even incredible in an
age of nuclear terror.
Burden of Proof
Surely the burden of proof for such
an aberration must rest with those who
demand it. Yet they have not been
required to carry it. For most of the
past twenty-two years Congress has
been docile and receptive to simple

assertions of the draft's necessity. But
for Vietnam,.a conflict whose wisdom
is blatently questionable and into
which thousands of young Americans
have been impelled against their will,
that state of affairs might have
continued.
The questioning has at last begun.
And the solution should not be far
behind—if we can believe that our
political system is responsive to
rationality.
First we must pose the precise issue,
and in this process the clear inadequacy
of draft reform, as opposed to draft
repeal, is exposed. If we accept the
conclusion that the nation needs a
military force of some size, and most of
us do while differing sharply on
numbers, our central problem is not in
choosing who among us will serve. It is
determining how enough manpower
can be attracted. Whether the choice is
based on pure chance or on the
prejudices of someone in the vast
Selective Service network, any draft
does the attracting by force. Any draft
tells young men, willing or not, that
they must serve or be jailed. It is that
simple issue which must be faced by
any plan that purports to improve the
system, and it cannot be faced without
repeal.
Gates' Report
The President's Commission on an
All-Volunteer Armed Force, led by
former Defense Secretary Thomas S.
Gates, reported early in 1970 that the
draft can be ended now; that a
voluntary' force is feasible. What, then,
prevents action?
Some fear the costs of attracting
volunteers. They first neglect the
intolerable intangible costs exacted by
compulsory service in a free society.
They neglect, too, that the draft does
not mean escape from the economic
costs of fair remuneration for military
manpower; it merely shifts them to the

young draftee who must not only serve
against his will but who must pay the
equivalent of a heavy tax for the
privilege. But even more persuasively,
the Gates Commission has concluded
that the real costs of improving the
conditions of military service to the
point where enough volunteers would
come forward would be far less than
most of us would expect. Cost is clearly
not a barrier, nor should it be.
Military Ethos
Others have argued that an
all-volunteer force will tend to create a
special military ethos which will
endanger civilian control of the
military. But in truth the draft has little
bearing on this subject. The individuals
who control the military apparatus and
make military decisions are already
volunteers. Surely the responsibility for
control of the military must be grasped
by the President and by the Congress.
We cannot expect much help from
randomly selected forced laborers who
rest at the bottom of the military
hierarchy and who are taught to obey,
without question, the commands of
their superiors.
A related objection with much
currency is that an all-volunteer force
might more readily permit
misconceived foreign adventures like
Vietnam, or at least make them more
difficult to end. But the draft did not
prevent Vietnam, it has not ended it,
and if we get into a similar war in the
future, the draft would probably be
reinstituted—placing us right back
where we are today. As to prevention, I
suspect that if anything, the voluntary
force might serve as some restraint on
Presidents and generals prone to
military involvements, because they
could not automatically count on
forced manpower to do the fighting.
Besides, this argument, like the one just
mentioned, also expects more of the
young draftee than we have a right to
expect. It says to him, "We in the
government, who are charged by the
Constitution with direct responsibility

over issues of war and peace, are afraid
to exercise our wisdom. Therefore, we
have devised a clever scheme. You go
fight, take injuries and be killed in a
mistaken war. Then perhaps your
parents and your friends will start
objecting and others like you who have
not yet been called will start protesting,
and then they'll create a political
climate in which we can act safely."
Clearly we should seek other methods
of inoculation against future Vietnams.
