# a 						question of balance
## Freedom Or Equality? 
### 
Of the arguments often presented
against the volunteer army, I am
concerned with only one—the question
of equity.
If draftees are replaced by
volunteers, there will be a significant
increase in the number of lower and
lower-middle class men serving. Upper
class college students would be even
more underrepresented than they are at
present.
The question, then, boils down to a
classic confrontation of values. Do we
value the draft's equity or the volunteer
military's freedom more highly? To
decide, we must determine how much
freedom is lost through the draft and
how much equity through the
volunteer military. Then we must place
the competing institutions on a balance
scale of our values to find which weighs
more easily on our consciences.
How much equity is lost through the
volunteer army?
The Gates Commission that recently
recommended the volunteer army to
President Nixon, attempted to dispel
fears that a large percentage of the
volunteers would be black and poor. In
fact, they attempted to turn the equity
argument against supporters of the
draft by maintaining that the low pay
received by draftees constituted an
unfair "tax-in-kind." Their arguments
are weak on both counts.
Higher Pay
Unfortunately, the Commission
addresses its criticisms almost entirely
at the existing draft. Certainly, they are
right in maintaining that the low pay
for draftees is unfair. But this can easily
be remedied within the conscription
system. It in no way proves that the
draft is inherently unfair.
In arguing that there will be only a
two to three percent increase in the
number of blacks in a volunteer army,
the Commission falls into the same
trap. The existing draft is already
grossly unfair to minorities since 30
percent of the qualified non-white
population is drafted while only 18
percent of the qualified white
population is.
This already unfair situation is only
compounded by the volunteer military.
To create greater equity, the draft must
be reformed by the elimination of
student deferments.
Lower-Middle Class
But, the greater participation of
minorities in a volunteer army is only

part of the equity question. It is as
important to ask whether or not
volunteers will be composed largely of
lower-middle class whites? Will the sons
of the working class in the city and the
sons of the small farmer in the country
bear a greater burden of our defense
and offense? These questions are
completely ignored by the Gates
report.
It only stands to reason that there
will be a substantial increase in the
number of lower-middle class whites in
any volunteer army establishing the
kind of economic incentives envisioned
by the Gates Commission. Because
these classes are largely forgotten
Americans who are not generally
considered "oppressed," discrimination
against them will probably not cause
much concern. Yet, it will be as
onerous.
There is one final question of
equity. Is a system of national defense
fair if it is unlikely that the sons of the
elite will serve in it? Shouldn't they
have to?
Days Gone By
The days when it was honorable for
gentlemen to serve in the armed forces
are past; this is the decade of the draft
dodger. Elite college graduates have the
promise of a successful life ahead of
them. They don't want anything to do
with bullets, or dust, or death.
The volunteer army simply is not as
equitable as the draft. Yet, the question
of what value we place on our freedom
still must be considered. How much of
our liberty does the draft rob, and is
the preservation of that freedom more
important than the maintainence of
equity?
Some do lose their liberty to
conscription. But who is to say that the
"volunteers" the Gates group foresees
are much freer. To a large degree they
are conscripts because of their
economic dearth. They are men
accepting a bribe to do society's work.
The Gates report admits that greater
military compensation will have to be
provided "true volunteers" than they
would receive in comparable civilian
jobs. That is the amount of their bribe.
In the end the distinctions are rather
clear. The volunteer army protects the
freedom of those who do not want to
serve and do not need to—in other
words, largely of the middle and upper
class. On the other hand, a fair draft,
would insure that the poorer classes did

not bear an unfair burden of society's
dirty work.
There seems to be a mad rush by
college students to support the
volunteer army. It may be motivated
by idealism, but I fear it is more closely
connected to their own self-interest and
dislike for the war in Vietnam. That's
discouraging for those who hope this
generation can help build a more
egalitarian state.
