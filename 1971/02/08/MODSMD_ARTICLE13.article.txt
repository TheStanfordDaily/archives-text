## Transitional Steps Necessary First 
### 
Raymond while

In my discussion of the draft the first assumption that I
am going to make is that an army is necessary to the
preservation of the very desirable republic in which we live.
Those who thing otherwise would do well to reflect upon
the physical attacks upon free speech and assembly in the
past few months on this campus.
Given that an army is necessary and desirable, the means
of filling the ranks must be decided upon. In the recent
past we have depended heavily upon the draft for this
purpose. It has worked, and it has had advantageous side
effects as well as bad effects. Let me cover the advantages
in brief.
The greatest benefit which the draft has provided us
with is an effective channel for upward mobility for the
poor and disadvantaged. Ours has traditionally been an
excellent society in terms of its opportunities for
advancement. The army has been helpful in this area. Even
now the re-enlistment rate of blacks is higher than that of
whites because there is less institutional (if not individual)
racism in the army. One would expect this is to remain the
case in voluntary military, but much of the upward
mobility effect would be lost due to the more restrictive
selection of recruits.
The recruitment for a technologically capable
professional army would not select the non-college student
over the college student is the draft did several years ago, or
even to randomly as it does now, but rather would select for
technically proficient people. This would omit those who
now stand to gain from service (voluntary or draft) in the
military.
Really Down
The guy who stands to gain with the military in its
present form is the guy who is really down, who has
virtually no skills and very little education. This person is
trained in at least the rudiments of some line of work. He is
taught the basics of personal hygiene (which some people
seem to lack), meets a lot of other people from different
kinds of backgrounds, and meets with opportunities for
advancement and education if he applies himself. At the
same time he has a secure if minimal financial position,
with benefits for dependents. The G.I. Bill and related
fringe benefits are familiar to all of us.
My point is that these would be lost if we made the
switch to a voluntary military which wOuld depend less on
manpower and more on technology. The bottom stratum
of society would have lost an important avenue of

advancement. This loss would be society's loss as
well(consider the idea that army has probably had effect on
improving the lot of the poor than most of our floundering
welfare programs).
Important Aspect
Another important aspect of the draft is its influence in
convincing thousands of college students to go into the
service through ROTC. The proportion of general officers
who came through ROTC is in the order of 45%. To say
that civilian influence never gets into the army is nonsense.
In a professional force with lower turnover there would be
less "civilian" influence at any given time. The danger of
the military losing touch with the rest of the nation would
increase, and more importantly, vice versa. That is, the
likelihood of societal polarization between military and
civilian elements is greater on the part of civilians.
Another factor against the voluntary army is the cost. It,
would be higher. How much higher no one really knows.
Some of us never want to find out.
Voluntary Force
As I see it the above is the abbreviated case for the draft."'
The case for the voluntary force on the other hand is j
morally a little stronger, even if this method would not be
as good for society in respect to the above points.
The advantage of the voluntary force is that you don't
have to tell a man he has to serve against his will. You
simply offer enough in the way of pay and incentives so
that the requisite number of men volunteer.
The unequal tax which the draft has been will
eliminated and all taxpayers will have to share in the cost
of the military where only a fraction of the people (men
only!) were heavily taxed to the benefit of all before. This' (
has much to recommend it. With additional
that the volunteer force would be more highly
better disciplined, and more efficient per man the idea of
volunteer force becomes more desirable.
As you can see from this article I am ambivalent about
which course is really superior in the long run. At this time,,
I can only say that transition steps improving the lot of
soldiers are very much in order and will certainly give
results which should be determinate in the decision as to
which way to go. I like the idea of a voluntary military, but
I wonder if the things we lose should be lost

now stand to gain from service (voluntary or draft) in the
military.
Really Down
The guy who stands to gain with the military in its
present form is the guy who is really down, who has
virtually no skills and very little education. This person is
trained in at least the rudiments of some line of work. He is
taught the basics of personal hygiene (which some people
seem to lack), meets a lot of other people from different
kinds of backgrounds, and meets with opportunities for
advancement and education if he applies himself. At the
same time he has a secure if minimal financial position,
with benefits for dependents. The G.I. Bill and related
fringe benefits are familiar to all of us.
My point is that these would be lost if we made the
switch to a voluntary military which wOuld depend less on
manpower and more on technology. The bottom stratum
of society would have lost an important avenue of

advancement. This loss would be society's loss as
well(consider the idea that army has probably had effect on
improving the lot of the poor than most of our floundering
welfare programs).
Important Aspect
Another important aspect of the draft is its influence in
convincing thousands of college students to go into the
service through ROTC. The proportion of general officers
who came through ROTC is in the order of 45%. To say
that civilian influence never gets into the army is nonsense.
In a professional force with lower turnover there would be
less "civilian" influence at any given time. The danger of
the military losing touch with the rest of the nation would
increase, and more importantly, vice versa. That is, the
likelihood of societal polarization between military and
civilian elements is greater on the part of civilians.
Another factor against the voluntary army is the cost. It,
would be higher. How much higher no one really knows.
Some of us never want to find out.
Voluntary Force
As I see it the above is the abbreviated case for the draft."'
The case for the voluntary force on the other hand is j
morally a little stronger, even if this method would not be
as good for society in respect to the above points.
The advantage of the voluntary force is that you don't
have to tell a man he has to serve against his will. You
simply offer enough in the way of pay and incentives so
that the requisite number of men volunteer.
The unequal tax which the draft has been will
eliminated and all taxpayers will have to share in the cost
of the military where only a fraction of the people (men
only!) were heavily taxed to the benefit of all before. This' (
has much to recommend it. With additional
that the volunteer force would be more highly
better disciplined, and more efficient per man the idea of
volunteer force becomes more desirable.
As you can see from this article I am ambivalent about
which course is really superior in the long run. At this time,,
I can only say that transition steps improving the lot of
soldiers are very much in order and will certainly give
results which should be determinate in the decision as to
which way to go. I like the idea of a voluntary military, but
I wonder if the things we lose should be lost

In my discussion of the draft the first assumption that I
am going to make is that an army is necessary to the
preservation of the very desirable republic in which we live.
Those who thing otherwise would do well to reflect upon
the physical attacks upon free speech and assembly in the
past few months on this campus.
Given that an army is necessary and desirable, the means
of filling the ranks must be decided upon. In the recent
past we have depended heavily upon the draft for this
purpose. It has worked, and it has had advantageous side
effects as well as bad effects. Let me cover the advantages
in brief.
The greatest benefit which the draft has provided us
with is an effective channel for upward mobility for the
poor and disadvantaged. Ours has traditionally been an
excellent society in terms of its opportunities for
advancement. The army has been helpful in this area. Even
now the re-enlistment rate of blacks is higher than that of
whites because there is less institutional (if not individual)
racism in the army. One would expect this is to remain the
case in voluntary military, but much of the upward
mobility effect would be lost due to the more restrictive
selection of recruits.
The recruitment for a technologically capable
professional army would not select the non-college student
over the college student is the draft did several years ago, or
even to randomly as it does now, but rather would select for
technically proficient people. This would omit those who
now stand to gain from service (voluntary or draft) in the
military.
