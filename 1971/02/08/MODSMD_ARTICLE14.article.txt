## The 						Imperative Of Abolition

bill evers

Truly radical politics in America are politics of
liberation. Freedom has not fully arrived until all men
are free, and for this reason, radicals in America are
the allies of the oppressed everywhere. But it is the
freeing of himself and other Americans from the
oppression here in this country which is the radical's
primary task. Ending the draft is a necessary and
important step in moving toward the transformation
of America into a free society.
In its early period, the American New Left
instinctively grasped the significance of the draft.
Around 1 967, radicals working in the Resistance and
the old Students for a Democratic Society built
communities of support for those who refused to
comply with conscription. Anti-Draft Unions, Stop
the Draft Week, "We Won't Go" statements, and
draft card burnings marked the beginning of
organized non-cooperation with the draft.
Although the number of draft resisters continues
to grow, especially in the San Francisco Bay Area, the
prominence of anti-draft work in the radical
movement has declined. Major problems in building a
sustained effort in terms of a mass movement were
the Judaeo-Christian "moral witness" posture of
many draft resisters and the difficulty in attaining the
"critical mass" of resisters that, once reached, it was
hoped would cause the whole system to collapse.
Failure To Expand
Furthermore, as Staughton Lynd and many former
members of the Resistance have pointed out,
non-cooperation became a fetish, inhibiting change in
the anti-draft movement. Co-ordinated expansion
into draft counseling, maintaining underground
railroads for A.W.O.L. soldiers and draft evaders,
running (1.1.-oriented coffeehouses outside military
bases, producing underground (1.1.-oriented
newspapers, and ensuring legal protection of G.l.'s
civil liberties was never successfully undertaken by
the nation-wide draft resistance community. On the
other hand, draft resistance groups were unwilling or
unable to pattern themselves after the broader
multi-issue politics of the old SDS.
With concern over the draft reviving, it is
important to learn from past mistakes and to sec
what light theory can shed upon Ihe problems of
eliminating conscription.
Conscription is involuntary servitude. No reforms,
including those called for by corporate liberals like
Sen. Edward Kennedy and the editors of the New
York Times, can alter the fact that conscription is
slavery. Only abolition can end slavery.

All those individuals who are, or have been,
adversely affected by the draft system fall under two
headings: the Slaves and the Abolitionists. (These
categories were suggested in a May 1970 lowa
Libertarian Association position paper which is the
basis of much of the analysis employed in this
article.)
For our purposes, Slaves include all those who
have been coerced by the draft. Abolitionists include
all those (except Slaves) who believe the draft should
be abolished.
In general, Slaves and Abolitionists have somewhat
different interests, different means of expressing their
demands, and different methods of achieving their
goals.
All Slaves are interested in the availability of draft
counseling, legal aid, and possible assistance in
minimizing the effects of legal sanctions. Politically,
potential draftees want draft repeal, draftees and
conscientious objectors want emancipation and
reparations, political fugitives and prisoners want
amnesty and reparations, and ex-draftees want
reparations.
All Abolitionists "want to be able to help Slaves
who are adversely affected by the draft and to be able
to speak, educate, demonstrate, and lobby effectively
for draft repeal, emancipation, amnesty, and
reparations.
Keep Draft System Smashed
Neither the old SDS nor the Resistance were able
to mobilize those interests in an effective way for a
concerted effort to smash the draft system and keep
it smashed. None of the prominent existing anti-draft
organizations seem to have recognized this key
problem.
Those who wish to end the draft must move
immediately at the grass roots, to bring the functional
elements of the anti-draft movement into a working
coalition and to set up a nation-wide network. Then
(he only then will the maximum pressure be applied,
and the anti-draft movement's mutual goals of draft
repeal, emancipation, amnesty, and reparations be
achieved.
To convince people that justice demands the
immediate abolition of the draft the explanatory
power of economic theory must be grasped and
wielded by anti-draft radicals. Conscription is an
example of the political economy of slavery.

"Who pays the price of this slavery? As always, the
slaves . . . The fact is that draftees are paying an
enormous price whether they're drafted by lottery or
by the old way. It's roughly equal to the difference
between what men could earn as civilians and what
they get from the Army . ..
"Draftees are not the only ones who pay. We all
do. We're denied the knowledge of the true cost of
our Vietnams and Dominican Republics. The true
cost of a soldier to society is what he could
contribute as a civilian. This can be roughly measured
by what he would be paid. So the cost of the 3
million plus soldiers to society is what they could
have earned in civilian life. You don't read about it,
but we're paying a lot more for Vietnam than most
people imagine."
Improved Efficiency
Economic analysis also indicates that the
efficiency of an army is improved when it is an
all-volunteer force. Volunteer labor is more
productive than servile labor.
But it is not enough to know that those who work
are volunteers. We must consider what they are
working at.
If the present draft system were contracted out to
Lockheed or Litton Industries for efficiency's sake, it
would still be an immoral slave system. If a
concentration camp had its torture techniques
improved by purchasing the best advice available in
academia, it would likewise remain immoral.
America's armed forces are aggressive and
imperialistic. Oppression, whether efficient or
inefficient, must be opposed by libertarian radicals.
In addition to terminating America's present
foreign policy of military intervention, radicals and
other Americans must consider alternative modes of
defending America. One might be the general strike
method used to a limited extent by the Czechoslovak
citizenry against the invading Warsaw Pact armies in
August 1968. Another might be organizing citizens'
militias trained in guerrilla warfareâ€”an
implementat ion of the right to bear arms.
Above all, it is necessary to diffuse power
throughout America so that there is no center or
single apparatus that an invader can capture and
employ to institute exploitative rule.
