principles
Editor, THE DAILY:
Several comments in recent
issues of the Daily have sought
to articulate justifications for
curtailing a speaker's opportunity
to speak and be heard. The
attempted justifications seem to
us cause for serious concern for all
devoted to the principles of free
speech — principles basic to our
Constitution, principles especially
vital to the survival of a free
university. Disagreement with the
views of the speaker cannot
justify disruption of his speech.

Free speech for those with
whom we agree is easy; tree
speech for unpopular views is the
most difficult, the most essential.
These are important principles.
They should be obvious ones.
They warrant reiteration now.

Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems a gross oversfght for
President Lyman to urge that only
students and University personnel
be allowed to testify in the Senate
draft hearings. 1 would think that
anyone who is, or will be of a
draftable age or who has a relative
or friend who falls in the same
category should be allowed to be
heard. This should include a large
number of workers, unemployed,
and especially Third World people
as it is from these three groups
that the largest block of
manpower for our military effort,

or I should say, to the State's
"armed Imperialism" is drawn
generally because alternatives are
not open to the member of these
groups.

irrelevancies
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Polhemus letter (Daily, 4
Feb.) attesting to the fairness of
Mr. Franklin's teaching habits is
an exercise in irrelevance. Mr.
Franklin may also write
authoritatively on Melville. He
may have provocative ideas on
early Science Fiction. He may
have deep and sincere empathy
for peoples of The Third World.
He like the rest of us may have
many characteristics worthy of
note.
None, however, are relevant to
the charges stemming from the
Lodge incident. The Advisory

Board long ago approved Mr.
Franklin's qualifications to be a
tenured faculty member of this
university. Those
qualifications must never again be
called into question unless specific
charges of misconduct in the
classroom or in the scholarly
arena are raised. To introduce
evidence of good or of bad
teaching, when the charge centers
upon infringement of the right to
speak and to listen, is an insult to
the reason upon which our system
of justice must rest.
Similarly, it would be entirely
inappropriate to consider Mr.
Franklin's moral stance on
Southeast Asia with respect to the
judgement of guilt or innocence.
The moral stance is not pertinent
to that deliberation. If a finding
of guilt is reached, then, and only
then, can the peripheral issues be
accepted for consideration, so
that a just sentence can be
assigned. ,

Propounding irrelevancies by
the faculty or others in the
community can only complicate
the Advisory Board's difficult task
of defining acceptable behavior by
the faculty. We must all pause and
think carefully about the
implications of our feelings and
our actions in relation to the form
of justice we wish to set up at
Stanford. Precedents may well be
set during the next weeks that will
shape the proposed Faculty
Disciplinary Tribunals, as well as
now add new perspective on the
meaning of tenure.

egregious behavior
Editor, THE DAILY:
There have been several ariticle
and letters in the Daily
defending Professor Franklin's
conduct in his part in preventing
Mr. Lodge from speaking. There
have been several articles showing
sympathy for the two SJC
disruptions. There seems to have
been less space for the side of Mr.

Lodge, President Lyman,
Professor Williams, the bulk of the
Stanford community, and
the citizens of the free world who
are all concerned about free
speech and due process.
We are appalled at the
disruptions of the SJC and at the
Daily's editorializing on the
front and other pages to stir up
riots at future attempts to hold
hearings. Not that the previous
slanting of stories by the Daily
has not led us to expect your
present egregious behavior.
We heartily support President
Lyman's moderate position with
respect to Professor Franklin's
conduct in Dinkelspiel and
Professor Williams' attempt to
carry out due process. President
Lyman has shown outstanding
patience, wisdom and eloquence.
He has shown appropriate concern
for the University's fragile
governance which is ill equipped
to defend itself against
revolutionaries.
Whatever our views with
respect to Vietnam, we love
Stanford University, free speech
and due process. We hate violence
and wouid like to focus this hate
on its exhibition on the Stanford
campus.
We think that the enemies of
free speech and of Stanford
Univeristy should be confronted
with justice with all reasonable

speed. Enough of this
filibustering, nit-picking, rock
throwing, arson, bullying and
intimidation.

early Science Fiction. He may
have deep and sincere empathy
for peoples of The Third World.
He like the rest of us may have
many characteristics worthy of
note.
None, however, are relevant to
the charges stemming from the
Lodge incident. The Advisory

Board long ago approved Mr.
Franklin's qualifications to be a
tenured faculty member of this
university. Those
qualifications must never again be
called into question unless specific
charges of misconduct in the
classroom or in the scholarly
arena are raised. To introduce
evidence of good or of bad
teaching, when the charge centers
upon infringement of the right to
speak and to listen, is an insult to
the reason upon which our system
of justice must rest.
Similarly, it would be entirely
inappropriate to consider Mr.
Franklin's moral stance on
Southeast Asia with respect to the
judgement of guilt or innocence.
The moral stance is not pertinent
to that deliberation. If a finding
of guilt is reached, then, and only
then, can the peripheral issues be
accepted for consideration, so
that a just sentence can be
assigned. ,

Propounding irrelevancies by
the faculty or others in the
community can only complicate
the Advisory Board's difficult task
of defining acceptable behavior by
the faculty. We must all pause and
think carefully about the
implications of our feelings and
our actions in relation to the form
of justice we wish to set up at
Stanford. Precedents may well be
set during the next weeks that will
shape the proposed Faculty
Disciplinary Tribunals, as well as
now add new perspective on the
meaning of tenure.

egregious behavior
Editor, THE DAILY:
There have been several ariticle
and letters in the Daily
defending Professor Franklin's
conduct in his part in preventing
Mr. Lodge from speaking. There
have been several articles showing
sympathy for the two SJC
disruptions. There seems to have
been less space for the side of Mr.

Lodge, President Lyman,
Professor Williams, the bulk of the
Stanford community, and
the citizens of the free world who
are all concerned about free
speech and due process.
We are appalled at the
disruptions of the SJC and at the
Daily's editorializing on the
front and other pages to stir up
riots at future attempts to hold
hearings. Not that the previous
slanting of stories by the Daily
has not led us to expect your
present egregious behavior.
We heartily support President
Lyman's moderate position with
respect to Professor Franklin's
conduct in Dinkelspiel and
Professor Williams' attempt to
carry out due process. President
Lyman has shown outstanding
patience, wisdom and eloquence.
He has shown appropriate concern
for the University's fragile
governance which is ill equipped
to defend itself against
revolutionaries.
Whatever our views with
respect to Vietnam, we love
Stanford University, free speech
and due process. We hate violence
and wouid like to focus this hate
on its exhibition on the Stanford
campus.
We think that the enemies of
free speech and of Stanford
Univeristy should be confronted
with justice with all reasonable

speed. Enough of this
filibustering, nit-picking, rock
throwing, arson, bullying and
intimidation.

Several comments in recent
issues of the Daily have sought
to articulate justifications for
curtailing a speaker's opportunity
to speak and be heard. The
attempted justifications seem to
us cause for serious concern for all
devoted to the principles of free
speech — principles basic to our
Constitution, principles especially
vital to the survival of a free
university. Disagreement with the
views of the speaker cannot
justify disruption of his speech.

Free speech for those with
whom we agree is easy; tree
speech for unpopular views is the
most difficult, the most essential.
These are important principles.
They should be obvious ones.
They warrant reiteration now.

It seems a gross oversfght for
President Lyman to urge that only
students and University personnel
be allowed to testify in the Senate
draft hearings. 1 would think that
anyone who is, or will be of a
draftable age or who has a relative
or friend who falls in the same
category should be allowed to be
heard. This should include a large
number of workers, unemployed,
and especially Third World people
as it is from these three groups
that the largest block of
manpower for our military effort,

or I should say, to the State's
"armed Imperialism" is drawn
generally because alternatives are

Mr. Lodge from speaking. There
have been several articles showing
sympathy for the two SJC
disruptions. There seems to have
been less space for the side of Mr.

Lodge, President Lyman,
Professor Williams, the bulk of the
Stanford community, and
the citizens of the free world who
are all concerned about free
speech and due process.
We are appalled at the
disruptions of the SJC and at the
Daily's editorializing on the
front and other pages to stir up
riots at future attempts to hold
hearings. Not that the previous
slanting of stories by the Daily
has not led us to expect your
present egregious behavior.
We heartily support President
Lyman's moderate position with
respect to Professor Franklin's
conduct in Dinkelspiel and
Professor Williams' attempt to
carry out due process. President
Lyman has shown outstanding
patience, wisdom and eloquence.
He has shown appropriate concern
for the University's fragile
governance which is ill equipped
to defend itself against
revolutionaries.
Whatever our views with
respect to Vietnam, we love
Stanford University, free speech
and due process. We hate violence
and wouid like to focus this hate
on its exhibition on the Stanford
campus.
We think that the enemies of
free speech and of Stanford
Univeristy should be confronted
with justice with all reasonable

speed. Enough of this
filibustering, nit-picking, rock
throwing, arson, bullying and
intimidation.
