# Far Freakin' Out
## KTAO Explores Community Radio 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
KTAO, broadcasting out of
Los Gatos at 95.3 KM, is a
full-time, stereo, listener-sup
ported station which has been
in operation for almost exactly
one year.
But this does not precisely
explain 4 8 continuous hours of
Indian music on Christmas Eve
and Day, station identification
breaks spoken by Angela Davis
("Free the Soledad Brothers
and all political prisoners. Ml
power to the people.") or
commercials which say "Go to
the Dutch Goose and Get
Drunk!"
What goes a long way

towards an understanding of
KTAO is some small knowledge
of its founder, Lorenzo W.
Milam, a child of both the
electronic age and wealthy
parents who has established
three other radio stal onfe in
devotion to what he calls "a
medium for onanists."
Lorenzo was raised in
Jacksonville, Florida, and
became particularly interested
in the idea of creating radio
stations when he first heard
the "Lonely Woman," a dj for
a jazz station, coming at him
with a sexy voice all the way
from New Orleans. The very
personal aspects of the radio

medium, the ability to convey
human qualities such as
sexuality over hundreds of
miles, presented interesting
possibilities to him and after
completing college and some
graduate work he began playing
around with KR AB-Seattle,
followed by KBOO-Port
land, KDNA-St. Louis, and
most recently KTAO-Los Gatos.
Listener-Oriented
Lorenzo's radio stations are
all listener-oriented, if not
totally listener-supported, and
reflect his notion that radio
should be available to the
people and should present them
with things they would never
hear otherwise.
In pursuit of these goals,
KTAO makes its air time
available to anyone who wants
it at rates ranging from $5 to
$20, and this offer has been
taken advantage of by such
diverse groups as the San Jose
Black Muslims and the friends
of a San Jose lawyer who
thought it would be nice to
give him a radio program,
complete with champagne, for
his birthday.

The station is run by 35
volunteers who put together
programs and help perform
business functions and who
range from the head of the
AV program at the Stanford
School of Education, who does
a Saturday program of Irish
and Scottish music, to a jazz
freak orthopedic surgeon from
Menlo Park, who works there
some weekday evenings.
Ethnomusicology Collection
The station's record
collection (surprisingly extensive)
was compiled by an
ethno musicologist from the
University of Washington, who
supervised the accumulation of
authentic Indian, African,
Asian, European and black
American sounds of various
kinds. KTAO also has super
collections of Bach, Medieval
Baroque and Renaissance music,
and is working on its rock and
roll deficienceis.
The station's financial
condition at this time is
somewhat tenuous. Operating
out of three small rooms and a
refrigerator with a volunteer
staff and equipment which is

not overwhelmingly new or
complicated, its operating
expenses amount to about
$40 ,000 per year as compared
to a comparable expense of
$250 ,0 00 for KPFA, and half
of this amount is payment on
the station's mortgage.
Price-Service Analysis
A station's income is
dependent mainly on the price
it charges for the services it
gives and KTAO is not likely
to be among the year's biggest
money-makers, asking only $3
per minute for local advertising,
which will be heard from Los
Gatos to San Francisco and
beyond, depending on the
weather.
This price is certainly on
the low side of the $10-20
charged by KSAN and KSJO
for similar services, yet is not
likely to provide the station
with quick financial security.
The station writes its own
copy for advertisements, and
although not all are as casual
as that often used for the
Dutch Goose, they tend to be
a little looser than those
usually heard, and also less
frequent, averaging about four
every hour. Public service
announcements are made only
for organizations of special
interest, particularly peace and
ecology movements, and
distasteful advertising material is
often read in Hindi or French.
One of the KTAO staff
members referred to the station
as "funky radio," and it is
certainly a media experiment,
turning away from the profit
motive towards the gratification
and education of its listeners
through quality music and
discussion of all
sort„s.
Lorenzo described it to
columnist Nicholas von Hoffman
as "commercial-cooperative-free
112 or m - n e o -1 istener-co ntribu
tive-pseudo-quasi-avant-gar-
d e - ece-so cio-poli-diver sal-re
tina 1 -Taoist-concoussal-recto-line
ar-palsy- fabbish-mod," but
whatever the adjective choice, the
station is an aural trip worth
tuning in to.

land, KDNA-St. Louis, and
most recently KTAO-Los Gatos.
Listener-Oriented
Lorenzo's radio stations are
all listener-oriented, if not
totally listener-supported, and
reflect his notion that radio
should be available to the
people and should present them
with things they would never
hear otherwise.
In pursuit of these goals,
KTAO makes its air time
available to anyone who wants
it at rates ranging from $5 to
$20, and this offer has been
taken advantage of by such
diverse groups as the San Jose
Black Muslims and the friends
of a San Jose lawyer who
thought it would be nice to
give him a radio program,
complete with champagne, for
his birthday.

The station is run by 35
volunteers who put together
programs and help perform
business functions and who
range from the head of the
AV program at the Stanford
School of Education, who does
a Saturday program of Irish
and Scottish music, to a jazz
freak orthopedic surgeon from
Menlo Park, who works there
some weekday evenings.
Ethnomusicology Collection
The station's record
collection (surprisingly extensive)
was compiled by an
ethno musicologist from the
University of Washington, who
supervised the accumulation of
authentic Indian, African,
Asian, European and black
American sounds of various
kinds. KTAO also has super
collections of Bach, Medieval
Baroque and Renaissance music,
and is working on its rock and
roll deficienceis.
The station's financial
condition at this time is
somewhat tenuous. Operating
out of three small rooms and a
refrigerator with a volunteer
staff and equipment which is

not overwhelmingly new or
complicated, its operating
expenses amount to about
$40 ,000 per year as compared
to a comparable expense of
$250 ,0 00 for KPFA, and half
of this amount is payment on
the station's mortgage.
Price-Service Analysis
A station's income is
dependent mainly on the price
it charges for the services it
gives and KTAO is not likely
to be among the year's biggest
money-makers, asking only $3
per minute for local advertising,
which will be heard from Los
Gatos to San Francisco and
beyond, depending on the
weather.
This price is certainly on
the low side of the $10-20
charged by KSAN and KSJO
for similar services, yet is not
likely to provide the station
with quick financial security.
The station writes its own
copy for advertisements, and
although not all are as casual
as that often used for the
Dutch Goose, they tend to be
a little looser than those
usually heard, and also less
frequent, averaging about four
every hour. Public service
announcements are made only
for organizations of special
interest, particularly peace and
ecology movements, and
distasteful advertising material is
often read in Hindi or French.
One of the KTAO staff
members referred to the station
as "funky radio," and it is
certainly a media experiment,
turning away from the profit
motive towards the gratification
and education of its listeners
through quality music and
discussion of all
sort„s.
Lorenzo described it to
columnist Nicholas von Hoffman
as "commercial-cooperative-free
112 or m - n e o -1 istener-co ntribu
tive-pseudo-quasi-avant-gar-
d e - ece-so cio-poli-diver sal-re
tina 1 -Taoist-concoussal-recto-line
ar-palsy- fabbish-mod," but
whatever the adjective choice, the
station is an aural trip worth
tuning in to.
KTAO, broadcasting out of
Los Gatos at 95.3 KM, is a
full-time, stereo, listener-sup
ported station which has been
in operation for almost exactly
one year.
But this does not precisely
explain 4 8 continuous hours of
Indian music on Christmas Eve
and Day, station identification
breaks spoken by Angela Davis
("Free the Soledad Brothers
and all political prisoners. Ml
power to the people.") or
commercials which say "Go to
the Dutch Goose and Get
Drunk!"
What goes a long way

towards an understanding of
KTAO is some small knowledge
of its founder, Lorenzo W.
Milam, a child of both the
electronic age and wealthy
parents who has established
three other radio stal onfe in
devotion to what he calls "a
medium for onanists."
Lorenzo was raised in
Jacksonville, Florida, and
became particularly interested
in the idea of creating radio
stations when he first heard
the "Lonely Woman," a dj for
a jazz station, coming at him
with a sexy voice all the way
from New Orleans. The very
personal aspects of the radio

medium, the ability to convey
human qualities such as
sexuality over hundreds of
miles, presented interesting
possibilities to him and after
completing college and some
graduate work he began playing
around with KR AB-Seattle,
followed by KBOO-Port
land, KDNA-St. Louis, and
most recently KTAO-Los Gatos.

Baroque and Renaissance music,
and is working on its rock and
roll deficienceis.
The station's financial
condition at this time is
somewhat tenuous. Operating
out of three small rooms and a
refrigerator with a volunteer
staff and equipment which is

not overwhelmingly new or
complicated, its operating
expenses amount to about
$40 ,000 per year as compared
to a comparable expense of
$250 ,0 00 for KPFA, and half
of this amount is payment on
the station's mortgage.
Price-Service Analysis
A station's income is
dependent mainly on the price
it charges for the services it
gives and KTAO is not likely
to be among the year's biggest
money-makers, asking only $3
per minute for local advertising,
which will be heard from Los
Gatos to San Francisco and
beyond, depending on the
weather.
This price is certainly on
the low side of the $10-20
charged by KSAN and KSJO
for similar services, yet is not
likely to provide the station
with quick financial security.
The station writes its own
copy for advertisements, and
although not all are as casual
as that often used for the
Dutch Goose, they tend to be
a little looser than those
usually heard, and also less
frequent, averaging about four
every hour. Public service
announcements are made only
for organizations of special
interest, particularly peace and
ecology movements, and
distasteful advertising material is
often read in Hindi or French.
One of the KTAO staff
members referred to the station
as "funky radio," and it is
certainly a media experiment,
turning away from the profit
motive towards the gratification
and education of its listeners
through quality music and
discussion of all
sort„s.
Lorenzo described it to
columnist Nicholas von Hoffman
as "commercial-cooperative-free
112 or m - n e o -1 istener-co ntribu
tive-pseudo-quasi-avant-gar-
d e - ece-so cio-poli-diver sal-re
tina 1 -Taoist-concoussal-recto-line
ar-palsy- fabbish-mod," but
whatever the adjective choice, the
station is an aural trip worth
tuning in to.
