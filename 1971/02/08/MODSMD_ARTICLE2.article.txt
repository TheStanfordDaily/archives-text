# Employee Suspension Delayed By Provost
## 
### PHIL LIND 
Library worker John Keilch, who
was to have been suspended from his
job last Friday, has received a
three-week postponement of the
sentence. Vice President and Provost
W.F. Miller, who had turned down
Keilch's appeal last Wednesday,
notified him of the extension Friday
morning.
In a letter sent to Keilch Friday,
Miller stated that, "At the request of
the Director of the University Libraries,
David C. Weber, and in view of the fact
that your case does not arise from
performance of your duties, but rather
brings into question your broader
responsibilities as a University
employee, I am postponing
implementation of disciplinary action
until March 1, 1971 or the conclusion
of the grievance process, whichever is
earlier."
Keilch felt that, "This was a victory
for the library workers. The
Administration is finding out that
intimidation breeds resistance. The
workers are learning that resistance gets
results."
Members Selected
Part of the grievance procedure was
the selection of a three-man review
committee to judge Keilch's case. The
members include Dr. Robert G. Lindee,
Associate Dean for Administration of
the Medical School, chosen by Weber;
James Berk, electronic engineer at
SLAC, chosen by Keilch; and
Chairman, George T. Gregory,
Associate General Secretary and

Associate Staff Legal Counsel, chosen
by the President.
Keilch criticized the entire grievance
procedure and the selection of the
committee members saying, "We all
know that the grievance procedure has
been stacked against me from the
beginning. Right now I'm in the final
stage—a three-man 'review Committee'
two of whom are appointed by Lyman
and Weber, who started the whole
thing. What's saving my job is the
resistance of the other employees who
are speaking against the action."
In a letter to the members of the
grievance committee, Robert M.
Nelson, Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations, stated, "The task
before the committee is to review the
individual grievance of Mr. Keilch in
relation to the pertinent policies and
procedures of the University.
Limits of Grievance
"Mr. Keilch has asserted that he has
been subject to improper and unfair
treatment in relation to the disciplinary
action taken against him, and that the
remedy he seeks is the complete
recision of this disciplinary action and
restoration to his former employment
status. This review is limited to the
consideration of the individual
employee grievance."
The three-man Review Committee
will probably begin consideration of
Keilch's case this week. If at the end of
the three week postponement period a
decision has not been reached, the
Review Committee will decide upon a
further extension of the postponement.

The three-man Review Committee
will probably begin consideration of
Keilch's case this week. If at the end of
the three week postponement period a
decision has not been reached, the
Review Committee will decide upon a
further extension of the postponement.
Library worker John Keilch, who
was to have been suspended from his
job last Friday, has received a
three-week postponement of the
sentence. Vice President and Provost
W.F. Miller, who had turned down
Keilch's appeal last Wednesday,
notified him of the extension Friday
morning.
In a letter sent to Keilch Friday,
Miller stated that, "At the request of
the Director of the University Libraries,
David C. Weber, and in view of the fact
that your case does not arise from
performance of your duties, but rather
brings into question your broader
responsibilities as a University
employee, I am postponing
implementation of disciplinary action
until March 1, 1971 or the conclusion
of the grievance process, whichever is
earlier."
Keilch felt that, "This was a victory
for the library workers. The
Administration is finding out that
intimidation breeds resistance. The
workers are learning that resistance gets
results."
Members Selected
Part of the grievance procedure was
the selection of a three-man review
committee to judge Keilch's case. The
members include Dr. Robert G. Lindee,
Associate Dean for Administration of
the Medical School, chosen by Weber;
James Berk, electronic engineer at
SLAC, chosen by Keilch; and
Chairman, George T. Gregory,
Associate General Secretary and

Associate Staff Legal Counsel, chosen
by the President.
Keilch criticized the entire grievance
procedure and the selection of the
committee members saying, "We all
know that the grievance procedure has
been stacked against me from the
beginning. Right now I'm in the final
stage—a three-man 'review Committee'
two of whom are appointed by Lyman
and Weber, who started the whole
thing. What's saving my job is the
resistance of the other employees who
are speaking against the action."
In a letter to the members of the
grievance committee, Robert M.
Nelson, Director of Personnel and
Employee Relations, stated, "The task
before the committee is to review the
individual grievance of Mr. Keilch in
relation to the pertinent policies and
procedures of the University.
Limits of Grievance
"Mr. Keilch has asserted that he has
been subject to improper and unfair
treatment in relation to the disciplinary
action taken against him, and that the
remedy he seeks is the complete
recision of this disciplinary action and
restoration to his former employment
status. This review is limited to the
consideration of the individual
employee grievance."
The three-man Review Committee
will probably begin consideration of
Keilch's case this week. If at the end of
the three week postponement period a
decision has not been reached, the
Review Committee will decide upon a
further extension of the postponement.
