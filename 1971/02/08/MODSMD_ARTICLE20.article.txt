# Research Exhibit In Second Week
## 
### 
The campus-wide research
exposition, intended to
demonstrate the range of creative
investigative work on the Stanford
campus, (from computers to
archaeology) begins its second
week today.
The focal point of the
exposition will be the various
exhibits in the Meyer library
basement. Included among those
planned for the second week,
beginning today, are a continuous
interactive computer opinion poll,
integrated circuits for medical
electronics, and the "Living
Computer," a demonstration of
computer Uses by the campus
facility of the computation
center.
A continuing exhibit from last
week explains the use of
holography, three dimensional
laser photography, to display art.
Other demonstrations during the
first week illustrated various
principles and then posed
questions to further stimulate the
student.
The exhibits sponsors have
made an effort to arouse student
interest, and to answer questions,
as evidenced by the sign, "Take a

look at these demonstrations, take
a look at some of our related
publications, and if your curiosity
is piqued, come visit us in the
basement of MeCulloch, Room
14 8... or surprise a graduate
student by calling the lab on
x 4175."
In addition to the exhibits, 10
films have been scheduled, a also
to be shown in the library. The
first one, screened last week,
concerned the Educational
Resources Information Centers,
and was termed by students
"funny," "kind of a Rowan and
Martin type thing." The next film,
to be shown Tuesday from
10:30-2:30 continuously, is
described in the schedule of
events as a "humorous film on
information retrieval."
Other events include special
tours of SLAC and the Big Dish
radiotelescope, to be offered
throughout the month. Tuesday
and Wednesday nights, February 9
and 10, will feature open hearings
by the University Committee on
Research. Another integral part of
the program is the open houses
offered by the various
departments. Three have been
definitely scheduled, and four
more are planned. Andrew Doty,
assistant director of University
Relations, says there is "still time
for individual departments to do
things this month."
