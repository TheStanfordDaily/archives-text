## The 						Losses Go On 
### don tollefson 
It wasn't Howie Dallmar's weekend. It was bad
enough watching his outmatched basketball team
get routed twice by California. But later Saturday
night, while he was probably enviously watching
the talented USC and UCLA teams battle, an
unidentified person lobbed two Molotov cocktails
into his Athletic Department office.
They were most likely trying to destroy the
second floor ROTC offices, but their success was
about as great as the team's success has been
recently. The two weekend debacles dropped
Stanford's overall record to 4-14 and their league
mark to 0 -6.
Neither game was really close this weekend, as
Cal outran, outshot and totally outplayed the
Indians. Cal has a large amount of talent, and
when they face a team as slow as Stanford, they
can run them off the court.
And run they did. Junior guard Phil Chenier
showed outstanding speed and quickness.
With 6-9 center Ansley Truitt and forward
Jackie Ridgle controlling the defensive backboard,
Chenier and his running mate, Charlie Johnson
were able to release and engineer numerous fast
breaks.
When these four abundantly talented men are
playing effectively,the Bears are tough to stop.
Against the Cards, they just ran and shot, not
needing to work many plays. As coach Jim Padgett
said, "It didn't take any coaching magic."
Padgett's comment raises an interesting point
about Cal. They don't appear to be "magically
coached" very often. Their talent should enable
them to play with anyone in the nation, but USC
and UCLA had little trouble beating them.
Admittedly Cal has a lack of depth, which is
particularly apparent when the foul-prone Truitt
gets into foul trouble. But even when their top five
are playing, they seem to be often undisciplined
and under-coached.

When UCLA played them, the coaching seemed
to be a major factor in UCLA's favor. The contrast
between the Bruins' strict, disciplined teamwork
and Cal's raw, unharnessed talent was great. The
final score reflected that fact.
But this weekend, Charlie Brown could've
coached the Bears and still won. Friday night, Cal
pushed out to a quick 29-14 lead and the game
was never in doubt after the (irst ten minutes.
Stanford shot a miserable cold 32.5% and it
probably could've been worse if they hadn't made
so many turnovers.
Ridgle had 18, Chenier had 16 and forward
John Coughran added 15. With the outcome being
decided so early, Stanford was able to substitute
freely and 13 Indians scored. Reserve forward
Brad Lind and reserve guard Cary Cain had nine
and eight points respectively, to highlight the
battle of the subs.
A mere 16 hours, later, the two clubs squared
off again before 3319 enthralled fans and
unfortunately, a West Coast TV audience.
Stanford won the tap and that was about it. The
game was close for a little longer than Friday
night, but the Bears still moved out to a 1 2 point
halftime lead. Stanford was able to cut the lead
to 11 twice in the second half, but could get no
closer. Ridgle had 23 and Chenier 22 to pace Cal
to their 11th win of the season. Terry regained his
shooting touch and scored to 25 to lead both
teams.
In preliminary contests the Stanford Frosh beat
the Cal Frosh twice, 86-67 and 78-71. The little
Indians have now won 12 of 1 3 gains and they get
a chance to avenge their only loss, when they face
San Jose State in a 6 :00 p.m. preliminary Saturday
night. The Papooses face Cal State Hayward at
6:00 on Friday night with the varsity hosting
Washington and Washington State on Friday and
Saturday nights respectively.
