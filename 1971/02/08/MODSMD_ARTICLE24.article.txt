# Golfers Win Two To Open Season
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
Stanford's golf team opened up
its season this week with victories
over Cal State at Hayward and
Santa Clara.
The scores in both matches
were unusually high, as nearly
everyone shot in the eighties.
Coach Bud Finger attributed the
high scores at least in part to the
conditions of the Stanford course.
"The rough is up, and the ball,
because of the cold weather,
doesn't go nearly as far. However,
these are not excuses for our poor
play, we're just not scoring like
we should."
On Friday, the Indians
defeated Cal State 30-24, the
medalist being the Tribe's Pete
Harpster with a 74 . Only Harpster
and Tom Watson with a 79 were
able to crack eighty.
Saturday was nearly the same
story, with only .John Beers, the
medalist with a 75, and Harpster
with a 79 scoring respectably, as
the Cards beat Santa Clara 35-19.
The wins were not that
convincing, but Finger pointed
out a possible reason for this. "We
have six good golfers on the team.
In these matches everyone is

getting a chance to prove
themselves.
"We want to give everybody an
opportunity to play now. We'll be
a lot better later in the season
when we get down to playing our
basic six." The Indian
Freshman also took a pair of
matches with wins over Menlo
College and George Washington
High School. Individual star for
the Papooses wa. e Dennis Conrad,
who on the basis of his
performances this weekend looks
as if he will shortly be moving up
to the varsity squad. His scores of
73 and 79 made him the low
scorer among both varsity and
Frosh linksters.
