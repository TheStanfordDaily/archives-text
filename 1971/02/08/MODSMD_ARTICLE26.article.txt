# UCLA Nips Card Swimmers

### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Weak showings by Stanford's
swimming team in the sprints and
diving events marred excellent
individual performances, as UCLA
slipped by the Indians to win
5 9-54 at the Stanford pool
Saturday.
Stanford's 4 00 yard medley
relay team of Fred Haywood,
Brian Job, John Ferris, and Rick
Eagleston opened the meet by
turning out the country's fastest
time this year, 3:30.4 to top the
Bruins by a full second.
Coach Jim Gaughran did not
regard the Indians's win in this
race as an upset. "UCLA had the
best time in the country going
into the meet but 1 think that we
have the best relay team around,
with the possible exception of
Indiana."
Brent Berk established a new
varisty record in the 1 000 yard
freestyle event, but finished
second to Steve Center of UCLA,
who set a new pool record with
the time of 9 :45.2 . Tim Broderick

placed second to another UCLA
record setting performance in the
200 yard freestyle as Dave
O'Malley established a new pool
record of 1 :42 .7 .
Crucial Sprints
The Bruins placed 1 -2 in the 5 0
yard freestyle with Stanford's
Steve Carey finishing third. In the
100 yard freestyle, UCLA finished
1 -3 with Martin Pedley winding
up in second place for the Indians.
UCLA's wins in these sprint
events were crucial to their
success in the meet.
Oaughran was disappointed at
his squad's showing in the sprints,
but he said that the sprinters
would be ready for USC. "We
have fine sprinters and with the
training program we have had, it
lias been hard for them to go fast
this early. I will step up their
program so we will be prepared
for the rest of the season."
Ferris and Dave Schilling
finished 1-2 in the 200 Individual
Medley and Ferris came on in the
last 5 0 yards to win the 200 yard
butterfly. Haywood set a new

Stanford record in the 200 yard
backstroke with a time of 1 :56.4 .
Berk and Broderick placed
second and third in the 5 00 yard
freestyle event as Center of the
Bruins won in the time of 4 :43.8.
Job set a new pool record of
2:06.9 in the 200 yard
breaststroke to take first, and
Schilling placed third after being
edged out of second by Tom
Bruce of UCLA.
Diving Problems
The meet was decided in the
diving competition and Stanford
was hampered from the start by
the fact that Bill Main was
recovering from the flu. Ted
Nichols took first for Stanford in
the 1 Meter diving, but UCLA
placed second and third to pick
up crucial points. Main finished
fourth, only .05 points behind the
Bruins third man, Bobby Balent.
In the 3 Meter Competition,
Main managed to place second
and Nichols cropped to third as
Sid Gossick of the Bruins finished
first. "It was a great effort by
Main just to be out there diving
and I am confident that our divers
can hold their own with anyone,"
claimed Gaughran.
A Stanford win the final race,
the 400 yard freestyle relay,
would have given them the meet.
UCLA's relay team was too

strong, however, and although
Stanford's squad of Pedley, Carey,
Eagleston, and Haywood made up
time at the end of the race, the
Bruins took the event and the
meet.
Unexpected Pleasure
UCLA's head coach, Bob Horn,
was pleased with the unexpected
breaks his squad received in the
sprints and diving competition. "I
was tickled with the split that we
got in the diving," Horn
commented. "This was a great
crowd today and they got to see
what I think was the best dual
meet held in the country this
year."
Horn expressed great respect
for the fine individual talent on
the Stanford team, noting that,
"Haywood was great. He was out
of control."
Coach Gaughran praised his
squad but admitted that
" . . . UCLA surprised us in the
sprints and diving. Other than
that, the meet went just as we had
expected. Haywood, Job, and
Berk swam very well today in
setting new records."
USC comes to Stanford this
Saturday for a dual meet that will
be very important for Gaughran's
squad. Gaughran promises to have
his team ready and is confident
that they can win that meet and
take the Pac-8 championship.
