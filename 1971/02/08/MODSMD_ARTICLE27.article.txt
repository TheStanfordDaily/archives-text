# Cards Lose First To Talented Alums
## 
### BOB MARKS 
It was a baseball game John
Hall and Jim Murray would have
loved: Stanford lost 4-2. The
winning team, however, was not
one of their cherished Southern
California teams. Rather, il was an
array of old Stanford stars back
for the annual alumni game,
played Saturday at the Sunken
Diamond.
The Alumni jumped to a 1-0
lead in the second inning when
Don Shellenberg followed Jack
Hodges' single with a triple down
the left field line. Both these
alums played on the 1 967 team
which went to the NCAA World
Series.
The ex-Reds maintained this
narrow margin until the eighth
when Jim Hibbs, now with the
Chicago Cubs, and leftfielder Bob
Boone, a member of the
Philadelphia Phillies, hit
hack-to-back home runs, driving
in three runs.
Strong Pitching
The Indians, meanwhile, were
being held to one hit by the
combined pitching of Steve
Dunning, 1 970 Collegiate Player
of the Year and now with
Cleveland, and Rod Poteete,

another member of the 1967
team. These two retired 17 in a
row over one stretch.
Phil Keller, a pitcher in the
Dodger's organization,
surrendered single runs in the
eighth and ninth, the second tally
coming on Rod Boone's home run
over the left-centerfield fence.
Despite the loss, the Indians
could be heartened by the
continued good pitching of their
reputedly weak staff. Starter Bob
Kammayer surrendered one run
and three hits in his three inning
stint, and better outfield play
might have prevented that run.
Freshman Hurler
Freshman Bob DePietro
pitched well from the fourth
through the sixth, allowing only
two hits while striking out three.
Only Bob Scott was hit hard,
giving up the two home runs in
the eighth.
One disappointment for Coach
Ray Young must be the defense,
which was sloppy at times on
Saturday. A missed pop up and
two outfield slip ups are
inexcusable for a team that aspires
to the PAC-8 title. Their record
now 2-1 , the Cards continue their
season with a home game against
San Francisco State on Tuesday.
