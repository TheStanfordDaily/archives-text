Swiss Women Vote
BERN, Switzerland — Switzerland
Sunday became the last Western
democracy to give women the vote in
national elections.
The male electorate voted 2-to-l to
accept a government-sponsored
amendment to the federal constitution
legalizing national female suffrage.
Complete official results showed
that 621 ,403 voted in favor of the
amendment and 323 ,596 against it. The
vote automatically puts the change into
effect.
Opponents achieved majorities in
only eight of the country's 25 cantons
and half-cantons. Opposition was
strongest in the rural areas of central
Switzerland, legendary home of William
Tell.
According to a United Nations
report just issued this leaves only five
countries in the world that still bar all
women from the polls: the Arab
countries of Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi
Arabia and Yemen, plus tiny
Liechtenstein.
No Withdrawl
JERUSALEM — Premier Golda Meir
will tell Egypt that Israel will not pull
back its troops from Suez Canal battle
lines unless such a withdrawal is part of

a formal peace agreement, reliable
sources said Sunday.
They said this is the message Mrs.
Meir will give the Knesset parliament
Tuesday when she responds to
proposals made Thursday by Egyptian
President Anwar Sadat.
Sadat, in a speech accepting a
30-day extension of the Middleast
cease-fire, demanded a partial
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the
canal during the truce period. He said
Egypt then would reopen the canal
blocked to world shipping since the
1967 war.
IRA Battles
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Rioters
in Londonderry battled British troops,
attacked a police post and hijacked two
buses Sunday in the sixth straight night
of violence spearheaded by the
outlawed Irish Republican Army-IRA.
Several explosions were reported
near the border between Northern
Ireland and the Irish republic.
Authorities said there were only
"pinprick disturbances" in Belfast,
where at least five persons were slain in
weekend street battles.
Unconfirmed reports said as many as
five more IRA snipers were killed in
Belfast and their bodies smuggled away
by their comrades.
