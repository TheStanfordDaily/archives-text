About 200 anti-war demonstrators
marched from a Lytton Plaza rally to
the Palo Alto City Council offices
Saturday afternoon where they
delivered a list of six demands to "end
Stanford/Palo Alto complicity in the
Indochinese War."
There were no incidents.

"Ho, Ho, Ho Chi Minh, NLF is going to
win," "NLF, Pathot Lao, U.S. out of
Asia now," and "Mao, Mao, Mao Tse
tung, Revolution while we're young,"
marched down the right side of
University Ave. and turned up Bryant

After taping the demands on a

forces and an end to the air war over
Southeast Asia;

Southeast Asia, and a guarantee of

support for any new government;

American businessmen;
—an international investigation into
the war under the Nuremberg precepts,
with special emphasis on genocidal
activities;
—an end to Midpeninsula support
and complicity in the war and in the air
