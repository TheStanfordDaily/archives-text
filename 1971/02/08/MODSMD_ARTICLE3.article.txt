# Window Breaking Erupts As March Protests Invasion
## 
### ED KOHN PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Reacting swiftly to the official
announcement of the Laotian invasion,
some 25 0 persons roamed around the
campus for an hour last night, smashing
at least 100 windows and lights with
large rocks and bricks. A University
spokesman estimated damage "in the
thousands of dollars."
No injuries or arrests were reported,
although a policeman was nearly hit in
the head by a rock as he stood in front
of President Lyman's office (Building
10).

Windows were also broken in two
Stanford Police Department cars. One

of the police cars was trashed as it
flashed a spotlight on demonstrators
hurling rocks into the Lou Henry
Hoover building.
Several fights broke out between
demonstrators and other
people—including members of the Free
Campus Movement—who were
attempting to stop the trashing.
Bomb Scare
Pine Hall, the University's
computation center, was briefly
evacuated after a telephoned bomb
threat at about 1 0 p.m. After searching
the building, firemen allowed people to
re-enter.
The computation center had been
singled out at a meeting earlier in the
evening for performing Stanford
Research Institute war-related
calculations.
Buildings trashed last night include
Lou Henry Hoover, the Graduate
School of Business, the Undergraduate
Library, Terman Engineering, the Job
Placement Center, the Civil Engineering
corner of Quad, Cubberley Hall, and
the Post Office.
Thirty-five police deputies from the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department were called to campus as
the first reports of the damage were
received, according to Bruce Wiggins,
the University's public safety director.
They arrived after the trashing had
ended at 10:30 p.m. and saw little
action on campus.
'Seize The Time'
The evening's activities began after a
stirring performance by the San
Francisco Mime Troupe of "Seize The
Time," a revolutionary drama about
the Black Panther Party, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. Tom Hay den, a member
of the 'Chicago 7' was slated to speak,
but yielded to a "community
discussion" of the invasion.
The discussion lasted for a brief 15
minutes, and about 250 of the 650
persons present joined the march,
which was ostensibly headed for the
dorms to gather additional support.
After moving down White Plaza and
past the Quad, the group passed the
Business School Memorial Auditorium.
Rocks began to fly as the marchers
picked up speed and moved past the
Lou Henry Hoover building, where
many windows had been broken prior
to last night's action.
The group then moved up Galvez
St., turned down Escondido St., passing
Crothers, Stern and Branner, and went
through the inner courtyards at Wilbur.
Concerted Trashing
Picking up support from the dorms,
it moved back up Escondido St.,
through the UGLY, where a rock was
thrown through a low window as
people passed through the lobby, and
down past Lou Henry Hoover building
again.
The trashing then began in earnest,
and other buildings were hit in quick

succession as the group moved up the
Quad, through the funnel near the Job
Placement Center, and stopped at the
top of White Plaza. At about 10:30
p.m., it split up into at least four
smaller divisions for dorm work and
other activities.
As they departed, the demonstrators
left a large pile of rocks in the middle
of White Plaza.
Minh Telegram
Prior to the Mime Troupe's
enthusiastically received performance,
Hayden announced that U.S. ground
troops had invaded. He made
considerable reference to a telegram
from Madame Binh, head of the North
Vietnamese delegation to the Paris
Peace Talks.
The telegram, distributed to the
crowd, read: "Alert you Laos Invasion
by tens of thousands U.S. Saigon-lhai
troops. Action intense U.S. Air Force.
Ernestly call you mobilize peace forces
your country. Check U.S. dangerous
ventures."
Another statement, from the
Vietnamese Provisional Revolutionary
Government, called for "massive street

demonstrations" to condemn United
States actions in Laos.
Proposals for direct action to follow
the Dinkelspiel meeting were made
immediately after "Seize the Time."
Last Year's Impact
"I think everybody knows that the
only reason we had any impact last
year was because 400 universities were
closed down by students," declared
Harry Cleaver, grad student in
Economics and a member of the Pacific
Studies Center.
"Some people want to take a
militant action tonight. That's right
on!" declared suspended English TA
Janet Weiss. "If different people want
to do different things, that's right on
too!"
Others followed, urging the crowd
to respond in the most massive way
possible.
Finally an Oriental woman came
down from the back of the auditorium
and addressed crowd.
"I don't have the white-skinned
privilege of sitting back and doing
nothing," she softly declared. "I think

The Coalition Against the War in
Indochina has scheduled a noon rally
on White Plaza today to discuss the
widening Indochinese conflict.
you should remember that the
Vietnamese people don't have a choice
and the people in Indochina don't have
a choice!"
Moving from the microphone, she
motioned quickly for others to follow
her out the door and the meeting
dissolved amidst loud cries of "Let's
move out!"
Andrew Grant, an SRI researcher
whose use of the computation center
stirred criticism at the meeting later
said, "I don't have any classified
projects." He also indicated that the
study mentioned by the Inquisition in
its leaflet was "not specifically designed
for Indochina."
Black students seemed especially

critical of the trashers. Many, talking in
small groups outside Wilbur, openly
condemned the trashing. "Don't
destroy anything tonight," one black
student called out. "It'll only up our
tuition."
Others simply said that trashing
Stanford was a petty act and had no
relationship to any of the real struggles
in America or to the invasion of Laos.
On the whole, the demonstrators
last night appeared to be older than
those who have participated in campus
demonstrations here earlier this year.
As in the past, many were non-students
wearing Venceremos (the large
revolutionary group centered in
Redwood City) buttons.
