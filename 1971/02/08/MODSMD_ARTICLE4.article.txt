# U.S. Lends Air Support
## Laos Invasion Official 
### 
SAIGON (AP) — Thousands of South
Vietnamese infantry men and armored
troops invaded the landlocked kingdom
of Laos early today with massive
American air support, seeking to sever
enemy supply lines.
President Nguyen Van Thieu said
the thrust was aimed at cutting the Ho
Chi Minh Trail, North Vietnam's supply
and infiltration network leading into
Cambodia and South Vietnam.
An armored column rolled westward
at dawn along Route 9 toward a jungle
region known on allied military maps as
enemy Base Area 60 4 .
Three hours after the initial assault,
an armada of U.S. and South
Vietnamese helicopters lifted in
hundreds of additional government
troops.
Pentagon officials say the strategic
goal behind the drive against key North
Vietnamese supply bases in Laos is to
block any enemy offensive in South
Vietnam for at least the rest of the
year.
Gen. Creighton W. Abrams
commander of American forces in
South Vietnam, said "No U.S. ground
combat forces are or will be involved
and no U.S. advisers are or will be with
South Vietnamese ground combat
units."
But the United States pledged itself
to air support. Asst. Secretary of
Defense Daniel Z. Henkin issued a
statement in Washington saying:

"American airpower will be used to
supplement the air force of the
Republic of Vietnam in providing
support to South Vietnamese ground
forces now operating against these
enemy occupied sancturaries."
The buildup for the sweep into
southern Laos began 10 days ago with
the movement of 20,000 troops and
9,0 00 U.S. soldiers into South
Vietnam's northwest corner along the
Laotian border.
In Vientiane, the Laotian capital, a
spokesman for the Laotian defense
ministry said he knew "nothing about
any South Vietnamese invasion of
Laos."
Thieu said his government had no
designs on Laotian territory or internal
politics and "will withdraw
completely" at the end of the
operation-code named Lam Son 719.
"This is not an act of aggression of
the Republic of Vietnam against the
friendly nation of Laos," Thieu said.
"On the contrary, this is an action
designed to stop the North Vietnamese
Communists from expanding and
perpetuating their aggressive potential."
"I solemnly confirm that the
Republic of Vietnam always respects
the independence, neutrality and
sovereighty of the Royal Kingdom of
Laos," he said.
Although the White House had no
comment last night, the "go or no go"
