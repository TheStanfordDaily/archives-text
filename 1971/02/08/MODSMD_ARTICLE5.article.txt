# Law, Politics: Separate Entities?
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Ncws Analysis
When the SJC hearings resume on Tuesday, at
which time Chairman Howard Williams is hopeful
that the prosecution will begin to present its case, the
Council will be forced to decide whether politics and
law are inseparable or whether law stands alone.
The defense collective, which is comprised of
seven defendants and several counselors, has chosen
to use the hearings as a public forum in which to raise
a multitude of issues, and in which to challenge the
University power structure and the policies it has
established.
The prosecution will charter a legalistic course,
and will rely on the resolution of two critical issues:
Was there a disruption on January 11 ?; and if so were
the defendants that have been named involved in it?
Inherent in the prosecution's approach is the
notion that those who are empowered to determine
the criteria of the word "disruption" are legitimate
policy-makers. Given that premise, policy becomes
law, and the application of that law is an impartial
exercise, devoid of political entanglements.
Different Planes of Discussion
If the defense collective were to meet the
prosecution on its own ground, the ease would
certainly be less complicated. But it is quite obvious
from the voir dire of January 29, that the defense
plans both to expand the scope of the hearings, and
to probe beyond t,he groundrules that the prosecution
will endeavor to establish.
While the prosecution hoists a banner of
unfettered law, the defense will insist that law and
politics cannot be separated. The existence of law,
argues the defense, is accompanied h\ the recognition
that some power makes the law The characteristics
of the power source determine the essence of the laws
it adopts. Thus, the power to define what is leg;il and

what is accepted makes the demarcation between law
and politics invalid.
The University, argues the defense, has such
power, and its politics are reflected in its laws.
Consequently, any act which is incompatible with
University politics, it will be posited, cannot receive
fair treatment from the University legal structure.
Thus, the reasoning of the defense prohibits the
acceptance of University policy because it would
imply the embracement of University politics.
Defense Rejection
The defense will reject these politics, will question
the right of those who hold them to set legal
standards, and will maintain that the defendants were
fulfilling a political obligation during the alleged
disruption.
The contention of political obligation is the
vehicle by which the defense will expand the scope of
the hearings. The post-World War II trials at Tokyo
and Nuremburg resulted in the establishment of
certain guidelines designed to make war more
humane. The Tokyo trials articulated the affirmed
duty to resist war criminals; at Nuremburg some of
those convicted "were only following orders."
Henry Cabot Eodge, it will be argued, is a war
criminal. In his capacity as U.S. ambassador to South
Vietnam, he was instrumental in the* commission of
specific war crimes- crimes expressly prohibited by
the tenets of Nuremburg. The defense will hold that
Ijodge's key role in U.S. civilian pacification and
relocation operations in Vietnam, as well as in the
policy of murdering Viet Cong sympathizers- not
soldiers wen 1 criminal acts. In the context of the
Tokyo trials, the defense will conclude, those who
allegedly disrupted Lodge had an affirmed dut\ to do
so.
Brains As Guilty As Body
Professor Kurt Steiner of the political science

department, and one of the prosecutors at Tokyo
observed that "policy-formers can be held
accountable for war crimes even though they don't
actively participate in nem.
"To interrupt a man who may be a war criminal,"
he continued, "is a reasonable defense. Lodge doesn't
have to be a proven war criminal, but there has to be
a reasonable assumption that he is."
However, Steiner was critical of the defense's
intention to stretch the war crime indictment to the
University Board of Trustees.
John Schwartz, who will represent the University
in the case, rejects political frameworks because they
tend to distort clear legal issues. "1 myself have never
cared for the term 'political case'," he said. "You
can't make a case a political one by calling it one.
Political Repression?
"Something which is consistent with a political
premise," he continued, "is not a political act. "If
you steal books from the library in response to a
political premise which dictates that books should
belong to the people, it doesn't mean that
prosecution for theft is an act of political repression."
The immediate significance of the conflicting
interpretation of the issues is not which is right or
wrong, hut which will be accepted by the SJC. If the
defense is correct in its assertion that this body is
merely an arm of the administration, than even the
S.lC's analysis is of no consequence.
However. past Council decisions have
acknowledged a linkage between law and politics.
There have been cases in which a defendant has been
found guilty of violating a University policy, but has
been acquitted because of the political motivation
that moved him to do so. This precedent indicates
that the S.IC will not shuttle the defendants into a
legal vacuum, and that extenuating political
circumstances will not be icnored.
