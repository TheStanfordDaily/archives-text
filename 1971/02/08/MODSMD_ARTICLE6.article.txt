Stanford has long been a community both
concerned about and affected by the draft.
The University's first sit-in was in 1966 to
protest the Selective Service System examinations
which were to aid draft boards in determining
who was to get student deferments.
David Harris, one-time ASSU president, will be
released from federal prison next month. He has
been serving time for non-cooperation with the
draft.
From being an early center of draft resistance,
to the sponsorship of an official University
committee which came out for abolition of the
draft, to the current personal lobbying efforts in
Washington of the draft repeal group, people in
the Stanford community have devoted time and
energy to ending the draft. Stanford students
have gone to school knowing that they might
receive greetings from Uncle Sam that were a
matter of life or death.
Our basic reasons for opposing the draft are
moral. We agree with the University committee
report which said:
"Conscription is inimical to central principles
of the American tradition. We believe that in
spirit, if not in Constitutional law, conscription
contravenes constitutional provisions against
involuntary servitude and the protection against
deprivation of life, liberty or property without
due process . . . The Draft ... is inherently hostile
to our long tradition of voluntarism
In addition to the fundamental nature of
conscription being slavery, we find severe
inequities exist in American society, and would
be mirrored in any draft system. This calls into

question the national service ideal ol some
liberals. And what sort of vision calls for equality
through slavery?
The present draft system illustrates all too well
the inequities conscription is prone to
institutionalize. War and the draft hit directly
only a small portion of the population.
Ninety-one percent of the casualties are under
twenty-six; seventy-five percent are among those
from nineteen to twenty-three years old.
Some Selective Service System practices
discriminate against blacks in disqualifying people
from the military. Thus, they contribute to the
disproportionate loss of young,
income-producing, family-bearing males among
blacks. For example, data on medical deferments
clearly shows discrimination against blacks,
whether the physical is given in Massachusetts or
Mississippi.
Furthermore, the past practices of the draft
system have been largely determined by local
boards, three-quarters of whose members hold
white-collar jobs and 98.5 percent of whose
members are whites. The attitudes and values
which they have brought to decision-making on
the lives of American youth mesh well with the
goals and guidance furnished in Washington.
In short, we find the draft to be
unconscionable. Both on the grounds of its
violation of human liberty and its perpetuation of
social inequity, we favor ending the draft, and
therefore urge the passage of the bill introduced
in Congress by Senators Mark Hatfield and Alan
Cranston which would dismantle the draft
apparatus.

twenty-six; seventy-five percent are among those
from nineteen to twenty-three years old.
Some Selective Service System practices
discriminate against blacks in disqualifying people
from the military. Thus, they contribute to the
disproportionate loss of young,
income-producing, family-bearing males among
blacks. For example, data on medical deferments
clearly shows discrimination against blacks,
whether the physical is given in Massachusetts or
Mississippi.
Furthermore, the past practices of the draft
system have been largely determined by local
boards, three-quarters of whose members hold
white-collar jobs and 98.5 percent of whose
members are whites. The attitudes and values
which they have brought to decision-making on
the lives of American youth mesh well with the
goals and guidance furnished in Washington.
In short, we find the draft to be
unconscionable. Both on the grounds of its
violation of human liberty and its perpetuation of
social inequity, we favor ending the draft, and
therefore urge the passage of the bill introduced
in Congress by Senators Mark Hatfield and Alan
Cranston which would dismantle the draft
apparatus.
Stanford has long been a community both
concerned about and affected by the draft.
The University's first sit-in was in 1966 to
protest the Selective Service System examinations
which were to aid draft boards in determining
who was to get student deferments.
David Harris, one-time ASSU president, will be
released from federal prison next month. He has
been serving time for non-cooperation with the
draft.
From being an early center of draft resistance,
to the sponsorship of an official University
committee which came out for abolition of the
draft, to the current personal lobbying efforts in
Washington of the draft repeal group, people in
the Stanford community have devoted time and
energy to ending the draft. Stanford students
have gone to school knowing that they might
receive greetings from Uncle Sam that were a
matter of life or death.
Our basic reasons for opposing the draft are
moral. We agree with the University committee
report which said:
"Conscription is inimical to central principles
of the American tradition. We believe that in
spirit, if not in Constitutional law, conscription
contravenes constitutional provisions against
involuntary servitude and the protection against
deprivation of life, liberty or property without
due process . . . The Draft ... is inherently hostile
to our long tradition of voluntarism
In addition to the fundamental nature of
conscription being slavery, we find severe
inequities exist in American society, and would
be mirrored in any draft system. This calls into

question the national service ideal ol some
liberals. And what sort of vision calls for equality
through slavery?
The present draft system illustrates all too well
the inequities conscription is prone to
institutionalize. War and the draft hit directly
only a small portion of the population.
Ninety-one percent of the casualties are under
twenty-six; seventy-five percent are among those
from nineteen to twenty-three years old.
