## A 						Draft Counselor's Perspective 
### 
Alan strain

The draft is a fact of life which faces
more than 20,000 men in the U.S. at
any given time. It is also a formidable
political and social institution, largely
taken for granted for the past 20 years
but now again a major issue as Congress
begins debate on whether or not to
extent the draft beyond June 30,1971.
I believe there are compelling
reasons to end the draft this year. The
facts and data generated by every major
study during the past twenty years
seem overwhelmingly to support an end
to military conscription. The rational
arguments for and against a continued
draft are, I believe, preponderantly on
the side of dismantling Selective
Service.
But it is not the rational arguments
for abolishing the draft which I wish to
present here—they are ably summarized
elsewhere on these pages. Instead, I
offer a few personal impressions and
convictions which have developed
during four years of full time
preoccupation with the draft and draft
counselling.
The American Way
My most vivid impression is that the
draft has succeeded beyond even the
fondest hopes of its chief architect,
General Hershey, in shaping the
decisions of millions of men subject to
it. The"club of induction" has, in fact,
driven men out of fields "considered
less important" into "activities which
were considered essential to the
Nation." The draft has indeed become
"the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by direction in
countries where choice is not allowed."
During the past five years under the
dark cloud of the developing Indochina
war, the draft has preoccupied most
men subject to it at least part of the
time. Virtually every major decision
these men have made about education,
family and vocation during these years
have been shaped in part by the draft.
For despite the fact that only about ten
percent of draft age men have been
inducted, some response to the draft
has been required of virtually all men.
Whatever those responses have been,
it seems to me that many men have
paid dearly for them. Those who have
unquestioningly threaded the maze of
Selective Service have come to take for
granted the right of the government to
manage and manipulate their lives. But
equally, those with strong objections to
the war in Vietnam or to war in general
who have pursued the law's provisions
for conscientious objection have often
also conceded this right to the
government.
Resistance Silenced
A good friend of mine whom I
recently saw in prison wrote: "When
my claim as a conscientious objector
was recognized I was pleased and began
to think that perhaps we had a very
'reasonable' system of conscription
after all. I found myself thinking that
it's a very good system of conscription
that 'allows' a man to try to help his
fellows to live constructively instead of
destructively. I had failed to stop to
question by what authority it came to
be that a man should have to justify his
creative inclination to his draft board. I
had failed to realize that my CO was a
convenient way by which my resistance
to conscription and the military was
effectively silenced."
Slowly, more men with student
deferments arc developing a similar
awareness of the meaning of their
privileged status and an understanding
that others have been drafted as the
price for those deferments.

There are other more subtle costs.
The high value which the draft places
on physical and psychological ill-health
for those determined to avoid
participation in the military, or at least
in Indochina, often weakens, I believe,
the necessary will to health. Or feigned
problems may become real problems.
And those who resolve to openly
resist the draft face the prospects of
prosecution, prison, and probation as
federal felons. Or they decide they have
better things to do with their lives and
leave the country, perhaps for good,
but without being able to forsee the
future costs of this choice.
Guilt Feelings
There are many who seem to feel
that the lottery has corrected the major
problems of the draft. But ironically,
men who are freed of the draft through
the luck of the draw often feel guilty
because they are free while others are
not; or once free, they quickly lose
their concern about a law so basically
inequitable that it compels some men
to take up arms on subsistance pay
while others are free to do as they wish.
(Their elders might more clearly see
why the lottery has not solved the
problem of equity if they were faced
with a tax lottery to determine who
would support the federal budget.)
To those men directly facing the
draft it has not seemed to make much
difference to replace Hershey's "carrot
and stick" method with the
lottery—channeling with Russian
roulette. (The number of men coming
to the counseling office in the Old
Union about the draft jumped from 25
to over 50 men a day after the first
lottery and has consistently been 4 0-50
men a day for the past year.) The
increased pressures on men with low
numbers has more than compensated
for the vague uncertainty for all men
under former channeling policies.
I know of no way to communicate
the cumulative impression of
frustration, powerlessness and anger
which has grown during four years of
observing and working with men
subject to the draft. The system cannot
appear to many of them as other than
capricious and irrational. Further, it
confronts them with alternatives all of
which increasing numbers of them find
unacceptable but among which they are
nevertheless forced to choose. This fall
over 4 0% of draft age men at Stanford
identified themselves as "conscientious
objectors in their own terms." For
most this seems to translate, "We won't
go." But what they will do is less clear.
The draft encourages them to play
games with the system and to seek outs
at the expense of others, usually less
privileged than themselves—a process
which degrades, destroys self respect,
or produces guilt.
Abolition of the Draft
1 do not know that I am determined
to see the draft totally abolished.
Abolition of the draft, 1 realize, is no
panacea. It will not in itself make our
society less militaristic, nor change our
foreign policy, nor re-order our
national priorities, nor make law and
justice prevail. But it will, ! believe,
remove one of the major causes of
inaction and paralysis, disenchantment
and despair, among those upon whom
our society must heavily depend if it is
to survive at all.
To abolish the draft, however, we
must first overcome what, appears to be

a calculated hoax about ending the
draft. Headlines have recently
proclaimed that the Administration is
at last ending the draft, an
announcement which is taken at face
value by all too many.
The Administration is no longer
talking about ending the draft, but
about quite another thing: reducing
draft calls to zero while preserving the
machinery of the draft and extending
indefinitely the President's power to
conscript.
However, for the first time in 20
years there is legislation before both

houses of-Congress which would repeal
the Registration Act and totally
dismantle Selective Service. Short of
that, there are bills which will return
the power to induct to Congress and
require a special act of Congress to
again invest this power in the President.
I hope that many of us will make
ourselves heard loud and clear to our
Congressmen to block the
Administration bill for draft extension
and to enact legislation which will put
an end to one of the most individually
and socially destructive laws in our
history.

Selective Service have come to take for
granted the right of the government to
manage and manipulate their lives. But
equally, those with strong objections to
the war in Vietnam or to war in general
who have pursued the law's provisions
for conscientious objection have often
also conceded this right to the
government.
Resistance Silenced
A good friend of mine whom I
recently saw in prison wrote: "When
my claim as a conscientious objector
was recognized I was pleased and began
to think that perhaps we had a very
'reasonable' system of conscription
after all. I found myself thinking that
it's a very good system of conscription
that 'allows' a man to try to help his
fellows to live constructively instead of
destructively. I had failed to stop to
question by what authority it came to
be that a man should have to justify his
creative inclination to his draft board. I
had failed to realize that my CO was a
convenient way by which my resistance
to conscription and the military was
effectively silenced."
Slowly, more men with student
deferments arc developing a similar
awareness of the meaning of their
privileged status and an understanding
that others have been drafted as the
price for those deferments.

There are other more subtle costs.
The high value which the draft places
on physical and psychological ill-health
for those determined to avoid
participation in the military, or at least
in Indochina, often weakens, I believe,
the necessary will to health. Or feigned
problems may become real problems.
And those who resolve to openly
resist the draft face the prospects of
prosecution, prison, and probation as
federal felons. Or they decide they have
better things to do with their lives and
leave the country, perhaps for good,
but without being able to forsee the
future costs of this choice.
Guilt Feelings
There are many who seem to feel
that the lottery has corrected the major
problems of the draft. But ironically,
men who are freed of the draft through
the luck of the draw often feel guilty
because they are free while others are
not; or once free, they quickly lose
their concern about a law so basically
inequitable that it compels some men
to take up arms on subsistance pay
while others are free to do as they wish.
(Their elders might more clearly see
why the lottery has not solved the
problem of equity if they were faced
with a tax lottery to determine who
would support the federal budget.)
To those men directly facing the
draft it has not seemed to make much
difference to replace Hershey's "carrot
and stick" method with the
lottery—channeling with Russian
roulette. (The number of men coming
to the counseling office in the Old
Union about the draft jumped from 25
to over 50 men a day after the first
lottery and has consistently been 4 0-50
men a day for the past year.) The
increased pressures on men with low
numbers has more than compensated
for the vague uncertainty for all men
under former channeling policies.
I know of no way to communicate
the cumulative impression of
frustration, powerlessness and anger
which has grown during four years of
observing and working with men
subject to the draft. The system cannot
appear to many of them as other than
capricious and irrational. Further, it
confronts them with alternatives all of
which increasing numbers of them find
unacceptable but among which they are
nevertheless forced to choose. This fall
over 4 0% of draft age men at Stanford
identified themselves as "conscientious
objectors in their own terms." For
most this seems to translate, "We won't
go." But what they will do is less clear.
The draft encourages them to play
games with the system and to seek outs
at the expense of others, usually less
privileged than themselves—a process
which degrades, destroys self respect,
or produces guilt.
Abolition of the Draft
1 do not know that I am determined
to see the draft totally abolished.
Abolition of the draft, 1 realize, is no
panacea. It will not in itself make our
society less militaristic, nor change our
foreign policy, nor re-order our
national priorities, nor make law and
justice prevail. But it will, ! believe,
remove one of the major causes of
inaction and paralysis, disenchantment
and despair, among those upon whom
our society must heavily depend if it is
to survive at all.
To abolish the draft, however, we
must first overcome what, appears to be

a calculated hoax about ending the
draft. Headlines have recently
proclaimed that the Administration is
at last ending the draft, an
announcement which is taken at face
value by all too many.
The Administration is no longer
talking about ending the draft, but
about quite another thing: reducing
draft calls to zero while preserving the
machinery of the draft and extending
indefinitely the President's power to
conscript.
However, for the first time in 20
years there is legislation before both

houses of-Congress which would repeal
the Registration Act and totally
dismantle Selective Service. Short of
that, there are bills which will return
the power to induct to Congress and
require a special act of Congress to
again invest this power in the President.
I hope that many of us will make
ourselves heard loud and clear to our
Congressmen to block the
Administration bill for draft extension
and to enact legislation which will put
an end to one of the most individually
and socially destructive laws in our
history.

The draft is a fact of life which faces
more than 20,000 men in the U.S. at
any given time. It is also a formidable
political and social institution, largely
taken for granted for the past 20 years
but now again a major issue as Congress
begins debate on whether or not to
extent the draft beyond June 30,1971.
I believe there are compelling
reasons to end the draft this year. The
facts and data generated by every major
study during the past twenty years
seem overwhelmingly to support an end
to military conscription. The rational
arguments for and against a continued
draft are, I believe, preponderantly on
the side of dismantling Selective
Service.
But it is not the rational arguments
for abolishing the draft which I wish to
present here—they are ably summarized
elsewhere on these pages. Instead, I
offer a few personal impressions and
convictions which have developed
during four years of full time
preoccupation with the draft and draft
counselling.
The American Way
My most vivid impression is that the
draft has succeeded beyond even the
fondest hopes of its chief architect,
General Hershey, in shaping the
decisions of millions of men subject to
it. The"club of induction" has, in fact,
driven men out of fields "considered
less important" into "activities which
were considered essential to the
Nation." The draft has indeed become
"the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by direction in
countries where choice is not allowed."
During the past five years under the
dark cloud of the developing Indochina
war, the draft has preoccupied most
men subject to it at least part of the
time. Virtually every major decision
these men have made about education,
family and vocation during these years
have been shaped in part by the draft.
For despite the fact that only about ten
percent of draft age men have been
inducted, some response to the draft
has been required of virtually all men.
Whatever those responses have been,
it seems to me that many men have
paid dearly for them. Those who have
unquestioningly threaded the maze of
Selective Service have come to take for
granted the right of the government to
manage and manipulate their lives. But
equally, those with strong objections to
the war in Vietnam or to war in general
who have pursued the law's provisions

inequitable that it compels some men
to take up arms on subsistance pay
while others are free to do as they wish.
(Their elders might more clearly see
why the lottery has not solved the
problem of equity if they were faced
with a tax lottery to determine who
would support the federal budget.)
To those men directly facing the
draft it has not seemed to make much
difference to replace Hershey's "carrot
and stick" method with the
lottery—channeling with Russian
roulette. (The number of men coming
to the counseling office in the Old
Union about the draft jumped from 25
to over 50 men a day after the first
lottery and has consistently been 4 0-50
men a day for the past year.) The
increased pressures on men with low
numbers has more than compensated
for the vague uncertainty for all men
under former channeling policies.
I know of no way to communicate
the cumulative impression of
frustration, powerlessness and anger
which has grown during four years of
observing and working with men
subject to the draft. The system cannot
appear to many of them as other than
capricious and irrational. Further, it
confronts them with alternatives all of
which increasing numbers of them find
unacceptable but among which they are
nevertheless forced to choose. This fall
over 4 0% of draft age men at Stanford
identified themselves as "conscientious
objectors in their own terms." For
most this seems to translate, "We won't
go." But what they will do is less clear.
The draft encourages them to play
games with the system and to seek outs
at the expense of others, usually less
privileged than themselves—a process
which degrades, destroys self respect,
or produces guilt.
Abolition of the Draft
1 do not know that I am determined
to see the draft totally abolished.
Abolition of the draft, 1 realize, is no
panacea. It will not in itself make our
society less militaristic, nor change our
foreign policy, nor re-order our
national priorities, nor make law and
justice prevail. But it will, ! believe,
remove one of the major causes of
inaction and paralysis, disenchantment
and despair, among those upon whom
our society must heavily depend if it is
to survive at all.
To abolish the draft, however, we
must first overcome what, appears to be

a calculated hoax about ending the
draft. Headlines have recently
proclaimed that the Administration is
at last ending the draft, an
announcement which is taken at face
value by all too many.
The Administration is no longer
talking about ending the draft, but
about quite another thing: reducing
draft calls to zero while preserving the
machinery of the draft and extending
indefinitely the President's power to
conscript.
However, for the first time in 20
years there is legislation before both

houses of-Congress which would repeal
the Registration Act and totally
dismantle Selective Service. Short of
that, there are bills which will return
the power to induct to Congress and
require a special act of Congress to
again invest this power in the President.
I hope that many of us will make
ourselves heard loud and clear to our
Congressmen to block the
Administration bill for draft extension
and to enact legislation which will put
an end to one of the most individually
and socially destructive laws in our
history.

The draft is a fact of life which faces
more than 20,000 men in the U.S. at
any given time. It is also a formidable
political and social institution, largely
taken for granted for the past 20 years
but now again a major issue as Congress
begins debate on whether or not to
extent the draft beyond June 30,1971.
I believe there are compelling
reasons to end the draft this year. The
facts and data generated by every major
study during the past twenty years
seem overwhelmingly to support an end
to military conscription. The rational
arguments for and against a continued
draft are, I believe, preponderantly on
the side of dismantling Selective
Service.
But it is not the rational arguments
for abolishing the draft which I wish to
present here—they are ably summarized
elsewhere on these pages. Instead, I
offer a few personal impressions and
convictions which have developed
during four years of full time
preoccupation with the draft and draft
counselling.
The American Way
My most vivid impression is that the
draft has succeeded beyond even the
fondest hopes of its chief architect,
General Hershey, in shaping the
decisions of millions of men subject to
it. The"club of induction" has, in fact,
driven men out of fields "considered
less important" into "activities which
were considered essential to the
Nation." The draft has indeed become
"the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by direction in
countries where choice is not allowed."
During the past five years under the
dark cloud of the developing Indochina
war, the draft has preoccupied most
men subject to it at least part of the
time. Virtually every major decision
these men have made about education,
family and vocation during these years
have been shaped in part by the draft.
For despite the fact that only about ten
percent of draft age men have been
inducted, some response to the draft
has been required of virtually all men.
Whatever those responses have been,
it seems to me that many men have
paid dearly for them. Those who have
unquestioningly threaded the maze of
Selective Service have come to take for
granted the right of the government to
manage and manipulate their lives. But
equally, those with strong objections to
the war in Vietnam or to war in general
who have pursued the law's provisions
for conscientious objection have often
also conceded this right to the
government.
Resistance Silenced
A good friend of mine whom I
recently saw in prison wrote: "When
my claim as a conscientious objector
was recognized I was pleased and began
to think that perhaps we had a very
'reasonable' system of conscription
after all. I found myself thinking that
it's a very good system of conscription
that 'allows' a man to try to help his
fellows to live constructively instead of
destructively. I had failed to stop to
question by what authority it came to
be that a man should have to justify his
creative inclination to his draft board. I
had failed to realize that my CO was a
convenient way by which my resistance
to conscription and the military was
effectively silenced."
Slowly, more men with student
deferments arc developing a similar
awareness of the meaning of their
privileged status and an understanding
that others have been drafted as the
price for those deferments.

There are other more subtle costs.
The high value which the draft places
on physical and psychological ill-health
for those determined to avoid
participation in the military, or at least
in Indochina, often weakens, I believe,
the necessary will to health. Or feigned
problems may become real problems.
And those who resolve to openly
resist the draft face the prospects of
prosecution, prison, and probation as
federal felons. Or they decide they have
better things to do with their lives and
leave the country, perhaps for good,
but without being able to forsee the
future costs of this choice.
Guilt Feelings
There are many who seem to feel
that the lottery has corrected the major
problems of the draft. But ironically,
men who are freed of the draft through
the luck of the draw often feel guilty
because they are free while others are
not; or once free, they quickly lose
their concern about a law so basically
inequitable that it compels some men
to take up arms on subsistance pay
while others are free to do as they wish.

inaction and paralysis, disenchantment
and despair, among those upon whom
our society must heavily depend if it is
to survive at all.
To abolish the draft, however, we
must first overcome what, appears to be

a calculated hoax about ending the
draft. Headlines have recently
proclaimed that the Administration is
at last ending the draft, an
announcement which is taken at face
value by all too many.
The Administration is no longer
talking about ending the draft, but
about quite another thing: reducing
draft calls to zero while preserving the
machinery of the draft and extending
indefinitely the President's power to
conscript.
However, for the first time in 20
years there is legislation before both

houses of-Congress which would repeal
the Registration Act and totally
dismantle Selective Service. Short of
that, there are bills which will return
the power to induct to Congress and
require a special act of Congress to
again invest this power in the President.
I hope that many of us will make
ourselves heard loud and clear to our
Congressmen to block the
Administration bill for draft extension
and to enact legislation which will put
an end to one of the most individually
and socially destructive laws in our
history.
