# DRAFT FORUM
## New Bills Give Wide Range Of Possibilities For Congress 
### 
Unless Congress acts to extend it,
the draft will end on June 30, 1971.
There are now bills before both houses
of Congress which would extend,
reform, abolish or replace the draft
with national service. But the public
generally is remarkably uninformed
about both the underlying issues and
about specific legislation now before
Congress.
Until recently the central issue has
generally been seen as whether it is

desirable to have a mixed force of
volunteers and draftees or an army
which is all volunteer. Now, however, it
appears that one way or another we
will have an all-volunteer force within
the forseeable future. This is now the
stated intent of the President,
Department of Defense, and Selective
Service. Debate, therefore, has begun to
shift to the issue of where the power to
conscript should lie: should it continue
to lie with the President, or should it be
reclaimed by the Congress?
The Administration's position is that
an all-volunteer armed force is
desirable. Therefore, we should move
to zero draft calls as soon as
possible—no later than June, 1973
according to Defense Secretary Melvin
Laird. But it is essential to preserve the
machinery of the draft and continue
the President's power to induct when
needed to maintain (or increase) army
manpower levels.
In the Congress, especially among
members of the Senate, there seems to
be an increasing will to remove the
President's power to induct—to see
Congress reclaim its authority to raise
armies as a check on the power of the
Executive.
During the first three weeks of the
91st session of Congress a flood of
draft-related legislation has been
introduced. In the Senate, Mark
Hatfield and Alan Cranston and others
have introduced legislation which
would repeal the basic draft act which
empowers registration, establishes local
boards, etc. as of December 31, 1971.
Senators Hatfield, Barry Goldwater,
and others have introduced another bill

implementing the recommendations of
the Gates Commission to keep draft
machinery on a standby basis but
remove the power of the President to
induct without express authorization
from Congress.
The Administration has introduced
legislation which would end student
deferments, extend the draft for two
years, and establish a uniform national
call by lottery number.
A bill introduced by Senator
Edward Kennedy and others would
continue the draft minus student
deferments and incorporating
procedural reforms.
In addition to legislation directly
concerning the modification, extension
or elimination of the draft, a variety of
military pay bills have been entered
which increase pay levels with a view
towards attracting an all-volunteer
force.
In the House of Representatives,
bills corresponding to all of the above
Senate bills have been introduced. And
in addition a bill replacing the draft
with a National Service system which
has military duty as one option has
been introduced by Rep. Jonathan
Bingham and others. This proposal,
which if fully implemented might cost
as much as 18 billion dollars, would be
funded by requiring participating
agencies and employers to pay the
government the market value for work
done by draftees, while the government
in turn would pay draftees a
subsistence wage. This bill has already
gained substantial support from liberal
members of Congress, including local
Representative, Pete McCloskey.
