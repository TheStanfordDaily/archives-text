The End of the Draft: A proposal for abolishing
conscription and for a volunteer army, for popular
resistance to militarism, and the restoration of
individual freedom. By Thomas Reeves and Karl Hess.
Most of the books and reports written in favor of
an all-volunteer armed force for the United States are
grossly inadequate in both the depth of their analysis
and the scope of their recommendations. They
concentrate too heavily on the abolition of the draft,
and tend to ignore the extent to which the
mandatory loyalty of conscription has infiltrated the
philosophies and mechanics of every major institution
in this country.
In The End of the Draft, Karl Hess and Thomas
Reeves easily manage to avoid these shortcomings.
They are not advocating merely an end to
conscription, but rather they propose to use the
popular power manifest in a successful draft repeal
movement to expand the people's resistance to
militarism and increase their control over their own
lives.
Essential to these efforts is a cogent, radical
analysis of what the nation-state of today is doing to
and demanding from its citizens. It is all too clear
that "of the people, by the people, and for the
people" slogans no longer apply.
Today's nation-state demands from the people
absolute loyalty, and the draft, which gives the state's
"national interest" precedence over individuals'
beliefs, ethics, and lives, is perhaps the most
oppressive means the state has for collecting on that
loyalty.
Counter Arguments
Reeves and Hess dutifully spend much of their
time countering the major pro-conscription
arguments, among them the fear of mercenaries, the
prohibitive cost of a voluntary system, and the fear
that volunteer forces would be filled primarily by
blacks. But these charges have already been examined
and disproven by a number of research groups, the
most recent and prestigious being the President's
Commission on an All-Volunteer Armed Force,
chaired by former Secretary of Defense Thomas
Gates.
Their report deflates most rational arguments
against an all-volunteer armed force. The
Commission, incidentally, unanimously
recommended that an all-volunteer system of military
manpower procurement by effected by .Inly 1 ,1970,
the date on which the present extension of the draft
expires.
Report Echoed
The Commission's report is forcefully echoed ir
The End of the Draft, and if there is any doubt in
anyone's mind concerning these arguments, or
concerning the nature of conscription per se, I urge
thai they read one or both of these books. The dates
Commission report is, of course, much more
statistical and more appealing to politicians in its

objectives, but Reeves and Hess come to grips with
more arguments and make recommendations which
are more far-reaching in scope.
For example, they scoff at critics who claim that
an all-volunteer armed force would lead to military
elitism and adventurism, both abroad and in this
country. The authors admit to the clear and present
danger of military intervention in domestic and
foreign policy, but they quickly point out that this
threat comes not from military personnel, whether
volunteers or conscripts.
Instead, the influence comes from the civilians
who head the C.I.A. and other National Security
Council branches, from civilian "defense"
industrialists who, under the auspices of Pentagon
strategists, monopolize an increasing portion of the
economy, and from the civilians in Congress and in
the Office of the President. Militarism is much more
than a future threat; it is a subtly engineered reality,
already upon us.
Another of the charges and which The End of the
Draft grapples is the complaint, stemming from
radicals, that an end to conscription will reduce the
number of threatened, and therefore politically
active, youth, while it bolsters the legitimacy of the
Defense Department and the state. It is an argument
which seems to propose the perpetuation of the most
brutal aspects of the state—in this case the slavery of

its youth—to insure popular recognition of the
resistance of the encroaching power of the defense
establishment.
But, aside from the disregard shown for those
whose freedom and vitality are now being sapped by
the parasitic draft, this argument shows a remarkable
distrust of the motives on which youth today base
their protests. In essence, this line of reasoning claims
that draftees or Selective Service registrants, if
relieved of the burden of imminent slavery, would be
less able or likely to defend their freedoms against the
state.
Threat To Freedom
In arguing against this charge, the authors reassert
the fact that the power to confiscate lives is such a
threat to freedom that it must be abolished. Draftees
cannot defend their freedom if they're forced to
either relinquish it, emigrate, or go to prison. The
draft itself is but one small cause around which
people rally, and the new consciousness which has
sparked protests will not evaporate when conscription
ends.
The abolition of the draft should not be viewed as
co-opting the fight against militarism. Rather, the fact
that the Administration is now reluctantly bending in
the direction of a volunteer force reflects an increase
in the strength of the people. Or, as Reeves and Hess
state in their final "hapter,"What the People Can
Do":
"The end of the draft should be viewed as the
successful resistance by the people to an unjust law.
It would be even more, a successful resistance to an
important adjunct of the power of the warfare state.
When the draft is ended, however, an army will
remain, and it will continue to be the base upon
which the violence complex builds.
It will be of the utmost importance to exert
popular control over the volunteer army and through
it over the entire violence complex. There are at least
a few of the president's advisors who now argue it
will be better for the warfare state to end the irritant
of draft resistance, despite the gains which come from
the power to draft. These experts doubtless argue
that the draft can be reinstituted when "needed."
It is therefore necessary for those who brought an
end to end draft to make clear that the state will not
again be granted such absolute power over its
citizens—that the people are saying "no" to the
warfare state in its demand for participation in
violent control. The resistance to the draft must be
kept up and extended to other underpinnings of the
war machine."
Tills is followed by an outline of specific means by
which we, the people, should resist the warfare state
and sieze control of our own lives, both now and
after the draft is ended. These projects—the
restoration of individual freedom and the popular
resistance to militarism—are really the main emphases
of the book. Ending conscription is just one crucial
step in the right direction.
