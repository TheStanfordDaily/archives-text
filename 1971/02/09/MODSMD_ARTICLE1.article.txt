# SJC Reconvenes
## Lodge Case Continues 
### JON DEDMON 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
is scheduled to convene at 12:30 today
as it continues to hear the case of seven
students charged with disrupting Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech here on Jan. 11.
The defendants and their counst.
however, Sunday issued a statement
saying that "The Defense Collective"
(as the defendants and their counsel are
known) totally rejects the arrangements
that have been made for today's
hearing.
Th'f SJC has limited admission to
today's hearing in Physics 101 to 125
persons, all predesignated by the
administration, SJC, and defendants.
Cameras have been installed to
broadcast the proceedings to
neighboring Physics 101 which has a
seating capacity of 300 persons.
Today will be the third time the SJC

has convened to hear the Lodge case.
The previous two times overflow
crowds pushed past police into the
hearing. Both hearings were recessed
following outbursts from the
defendants and gallery, the first after
several minutes, the second after three
hours.
The Defense Collective statement on
Sunday demanded that today's hearing
"be held in a room large enough so that
all those who wish to attend may do
so."
Calling the video broadcast "but
another attempt to separate the trial
from the people of the community,"
the statement went on to claim that the
video tape will give "government
officials an added opportunity to
gather evidence" for "prosecution
efforts" and for "various government
files."
John Schwartz, Assistant to the

Provost, said last night that the video
procedure had been instituted "as a
response to the defendants' demands
that the hearing be as public as
possible."
The Defense Collective statement
warned that "the hearing Tuesday will
not be a closed hearing as Williams (SJC
Chairman Howard Williams) and
Lyman plan. There is no way that
people will be prevented from seeing
these proceedings."
Schwartz said last night concerning
security at today's hearing, "The
administration will do everything
reasonably possible to insure that the
hearings are not disrupted from
without."
In other matters concerning the
case, President Lyman Friday sent a
letter to SJC Chairman Howard
Williams informing him that no action
would be taken against Prof. H. Bruce
Franklin whom Williams cited for
contempt at the Jan. 29 hearing of the
Lodge case.
Lyman wrote, "As you are of course
aware, Professor Franklin faces serious
charges in connection with the so-callec.
Lodge meeting." After listening to
tapes and eyewitness accounts, Lyman
said that although Franklin's attitude
was "uncivil," it was "not as serious as
that of the students who were
suspended for the duration of the
case."
The four students to whom Lyman
was referring are four defendants whom
Lyman suspended for contempt at the
Jan. 29 hearing.
Lyman concluded his letter by
stating that he did not "believe that a
clear resolution of the primary charges
against Prof. Franklin would be aided
by the initiation of a separate action
based on his behavior on Jan. 29."

where they had besieged a small group of trustees and President Richard Lyman.
