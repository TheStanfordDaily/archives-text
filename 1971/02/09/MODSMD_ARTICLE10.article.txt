Two Stanford chemists, both of
whom have won world-wide acclaim for
their contributions to synthetic organic
chemistry, will appear as lecturers in
the fourth of the "Relevance of
Chemistry" series being sponsored by
Stanford's Department of Chemistry.
Profs. William S. Johnson and
Eugene van Tamelen will each deal with
some aspect of the subject, "Form and
Function in Chemistry," at 8 p.m.
tomorrow night, in the Physics Lecture
Hall.
Professor Johnson will discuss, as
function, the use of hormones and sex
attractants in the battle against insects.
Last year he received the first Roussel
Prize of 30,000 francs ($6,000) for his
work from France's Roussel-Uclaf
Society, in addition to some of the
highest awards of the American
Chemical Society which he already
held.
