# Lyman, Students Discuss Tactics
## 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman met
with students in informal dormatory
discussions last night in an attempt to
sound out campus reaction to
yesterday's student-police
confrontation.
Accompanied by his teenage son,
Lyman went to Roble Hall where he
discussed police action and the brief
□Id Union sit-in with a crowd of nearly
50 undergraduates. Later, he moved to
Toyon Hall and met with more than 20
students.
At Roble, Lyman stated he
supported the idea of dedicating all of
one's actions to stopping the war, but
was not in favor of a general student
strike. "If people feel they must drop
everything in order to go out and be
effective in ending the war without
destroying things, I support this," he
said. "But the University must be kept
open for those who wish to study."
He emphasized his position in
relation to the Trustees saying, "I am
not their lackey, but at the same time,
they are not my pawns either."
' "I don't think you are going to stop
the war by what you do at Stanford or
what you do to it,"he said. "I don't
think that you persuade people with
violence. If anything, you persuade
them negatively."' »•.
