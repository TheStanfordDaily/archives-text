# Student Protests Draft To Senate Committee
## 
### 
Pete Knutson, chairman of the
University Draft Repeal Movement,
urged the Senate Armed Services
Committee yesterday to approve
legislation to abolish the draft.
In a verbal attack, he charged the
legislators with betraying the
Constitution and engendering the
hatred of young people by forcing
them to serve in Vietnam.
Knutson said that things would be
different if legislators were "given a
M-16 and told to lead the first wave."
South Carolina Senator Strom
Thurmond then walked out.
He compared the moral dilemna
facing young men with American men
having to fight on the side of Germany
in World War 11.
"If during the course of the Second
World War, America had entered on the
side of Hitler's Germany, would you
have allowed yourself to be drafted?"

"And would you have blindly said,
'My country right or wrong.' "
"I hope you can appreciate the
magnitude of that dilemna because that
same painful choice faces millions of
Americans today."
He questioned why the Congress
failed to declare war and asked
rhetorically whether it could be
because a majority felt that the war
wasn't "just enough" to warrant a
declaration.
In the third day of the hearing,
freshman Knutson is the first and
possibly the last of draft age men to
testify before Mississippi Senator
Stennis' committee.
Last week President Richard Lyman
sent a telegram to the committee
requesting that the hearing be open to
draft age men.
President Nixon has introduced
legislation to extend the draft past its
expiration date of June 30,1 971 .
