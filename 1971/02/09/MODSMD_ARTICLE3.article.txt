# Police Sweep Protesters From Campus Buildings
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
About 30 members of the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs Department and
the San Jose Tactical Squad broke up a
peaceful two-hour sit-in at the Old
Union early yesterday evening.
The sit-in developed after police
forced 200 persons to leave the lobby
in the Graduate School of Business
where a Board of Trustees committee
meeting was being held in an adjacent
classroom.
One person was arrested at the
Business School, and one policeman
was hit in the head by a rock. He
received several stitches and was
released.
There were no incidents when the
Sheriffs declared the sit-in an illegal
assembly and ordered the group to
disband.
Earlier at the Business School, about
200 closely-packed demonstrators
chanting anti-war slogans held the
committee meeting virtually under
seige for about 45 minutes, when the
area was cleared 300 spectators
watched the scene at the north end of
the Business School.
List Of Demands
The group had attempted to enter
the classroom where the meeting, was
in progress to present a series of
demands to the Trustees. They were
unable to gain access to the room,
however.
Before marching on the Business
School, the group had first attempted
to interrupt the Trustees while they
were at lunch in the faculty club. But
the Trustees had already left the club
when the demonstrators arrived.
Yesterday's demonstrations started
with a large noon rally in White Plaza.
The rally sponsored by the Coalition
Against the War in Indochina, to
protest the Laotian invasion drew over
700 people.
Banning Garrett, Asian editor of
Ramparts Magazine and a Stanford
graduate, told the rally, "(The invasion)
is just the beginning. There's a
possibility of the United States troops
invading over the Demilitarized Zone.
But more likely than this is the
possibility that nuclear weapons will be
used when this fails."
Weiss Addresses Crowd
Janet Weiss, a suspended English TA
and one of the eight SJC defendants,
said that "the Vietnamese peasants are
beginning to feel betrayed by us.
"They are making an appeal to us.
Everybody has to respond on whatever
level he can."
Speaking after Weiss, Harry Cleaver,
a member of Pacific Studies Center,
explained, "In a time of crisis we can
exercise the power we have by closing
the University."
Different Emphasis
However, a black speaker who
followed said that these were not
important as "most brothers and sisters
can't even get into this University.
Among the speakers that followed,
one black student asked the crowd to

"remember the breaking windows only
hurt the brothers and sisters here."
He pointed out that part of the
damage costs would come out of
minority scholarship funds.
A few more speakers discussed
alternatives for action and
after an announcement that Wednesday
would be a day of nation-wide college
strikes, the crowd moved toward the
Faculty Club.
Finding that the Trustees had
already left, the crowd headed for the
Business School.
President Lyman, who was in the
room under seige with a small number
of Trustees and advisers, issued a
statement yesterday which read in
part:"
"If the war could be ended by the
issuance of anguished statements by
University presidents it would have
ended long ago. But the war can only
be ended by hard and sustained
political work. Too few people in
Universities have been willing to do
that kind of work.
"Instead, we have allowed a
situation to develop in which the
anti-war movement gets written off by
large sections of the public as the
aberration of a few "campus crazies'."
Entrance Denied
Once in the lobby, the
demonstrators made an unsuccessful
attempt to enter the meeting room.

Outside the room, they made a series of
demands:
—that the Trustees make peace with
the people of Southeast Asia in the
name of the students faculty and staff
of Stanford.
—that amnesty be granted those
facing disciplinary action for disruption
of the Henry Cabot Lodge speech
January 11 (eight defendents are
currently on trial before the Stanford
Judicial Council in connection with the
incident. English professor Bruce
Franklin faces a hearing before the
all-faculty Advisory Board and a
three-man committee will soon review
the case of library employee John
Keilch both also in connection with the
Lodge incident.)
At approximately 1:55 p.m., Santa
Clara Sheriff's Deputies moved on the
crowd and the County field
enforcement supervisor declared the
assembly unlawful and said that all who
remained were subject to arrest.
The crowd, about 500, milled
around the upper terrace on the north
side of the school and, at least one
smaller group confronted a line of
deputies, but there were no major
incidents.
To The Old Union
At about 2:45 p.m., the crowd
started to leave the Business School, a
large section breaking and the heading

for the Old Union Courtyard. One
hundred and fifty demonstrators
moved into the courtyard area and 5 0
proceeded into the Union lobby.
Shortly after, a meeting was called
in the lobby which was attended by
about 130 people. The demonstrators
there decided to hold the Old Union as
a strike center, and also discussed
occupying other campus offices,
specifically the ASSU office and the
Daily.
By this time almost all the crowd at
the Business School dispersed.
The Old Union meeting decided to
break into small groups at 4 :20 p.m.,
one group to handle surveillence, one
to help bring people today's Los Siete
rally in Redwood City, one to recruit
new members for the sit-in, and one to
handle propaganda. The meeting began
to thin out.
At 5:30 p.m., 20 Santa Clara
Sheriff's Deputies moved into the Old
Union from the rear entrances,
sweeping the remaining 4 0 occupants
of the building into the courtyard.
At the same time, 15 San Jose
Tactical Squad members moved to
block off the front of the Old Union.

The doors of the Union were locked
and a line of tactical squad people were
left guarding the front of the building.
At about 5 :45 p.m. the San Jose units
retreated inside the building, and
shortly after, entered a bus behind the
building and left the scene.
The crowd which had gathered in
the courtyard after the deputies arrived
broke into smaller groups, discussing
strategies talking to dormitory residents
that evening.
No incidents were reported last
night, as numerous iquads of Santa
Clara County and San Jose police
patrolled the campus on foot as well as
by car. Strollers were stopped and
asked for identification. The county
curfew for minors was being rigidly
inforced after 10:00 p.m.
