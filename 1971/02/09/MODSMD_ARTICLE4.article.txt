# Democrats Start 1972 Campaign
## 
### SCOTT THACHER News Analysis 
The conclusion of a national
election never provides a reprieve for
the ambitions of a politician. He hides
his time for a few months, content with
occasional strategy sessions, before
setting out to prove his strength once
more.
Kdmund Muskie and George
McGovern are actively seeking the
Democratic presidential nomination,
still a year and a half away. Both took
part nationally in congressional
campaigns last fall, and both have
recently traveled to California to
organize their supporters, Stanford
students among them.
Senator Kdmund Muskie of Maine is
given the best chance of capturing the
nomination. A Gallup poll taken last
January showed Muskie and President
Nixon each receiving 4 4% of the vote in
a hypothetical election. Muskie's
prominence dates from 1 968 when he
was Humphrey's running mate.
Less favored is Senator George
McGovern of South Dakota. He is
distinguished for his long and
consistent record of opposition to the
Vietnam War, and two years ago he
made his first bid to be nominated as
President at the Democratic convention
in Chicago.
Three weeks ago McGovern
announced he was seeking the

nomination again. His candidacy is
serious, and certainly is not just a
symbolic gesture of opposition to
Nixon. "I'm in the race to win," he
said. "I plan to go the duration."
Yet it is almost unheard of for a
Presidential candidate to announce so
soon. Professor Robert Horn of
Political Science sees this as "an
acknowledgement that he doesn't have
a great deal of effective strength." He
adds, "When the presidential bee gets in
a man's bonnet it's pretty hard to get it
out."
Given that Muskie seems to have
inherited the support of organized
labor and other traditional elements of
the Democratic party, is it reasonable
to assume that he has the nomination
in his pocket?
Tom Coughlin, who led a delegation
of Stanford students to meet Muskie
when he was in Sacramento, says,"The
first people who do not underestimate
McGovern are Muskie's staff."
Important Primaries
McGovern could make the greatest
advances against Muskie in the
Presidential primaries next year. Unlike
nominating conventions, the votes
cannot be traded off for favors done or
settled by commitments made months
in advance. The money required to run
in them is small, as well.
Thus a relatively unknown
contender, such as McGovern, could

upset Muskie. Political Science
Professor Raymond Wolfinger says,
"One of the beautiful things about the
primary is that you go from success to
success. People like a winner."
Next to preparing for the primaries,
each man must find an image that a
broad range of supporters can identify
with. Muskie's job lies in consolidating
the central position he already holds.
"More Moods"
Professor Gabriel Almond of
Political Science finds that as a person
"Muskie has got more surfaces, more
moods (than McGovern)". "He came
through with a lot of control and
modulation," Almond thinks, when he
replied to President Nixon's speech on
violence in San Jose, just before the
congressional elections last year.
As a strong, dependable statesman,
Muskie's four hour interview with
Kosygin in Moscow near the end of his
recent European tour has helped him
considerably.
McGovern will get his initial support
from the anti-war movement. His image
of moral outrage is very clear-cut. He
says that those Congressmen who
support wider American attacks in
Southeast Asia should lead the battle
themselves.
Still, in Almond's view McGovern
must become more of a fighter. He is
still on the periphery as far as the
public is concerned.

These two men by no means have
the fielG to themselves. It is likely that
Mayor John Lindsay of New York will
switch his registration from Republican
to Democratic in time for the primaries
next year.
This is by no means unexpected
since Lindsay ran for his second term as
mayor on an independent ticket. Last
fall he supported Arthur Goldberg, a
Democrat, against Rockefeller for
governor of New York.
l>arry Diamond, a sophomore who
was campaign manager for Stu
McLean's unsuccessful congressional
race last fall, emphasizes "how
confused and topsy-turvy this is all
going to be."
He thinks Senator Howard Hughes
of lowa, a peace candidate of the
caliber of McGovern, and Birch Bayh, a
Senator from Indiana, who has strong
labor support, both pose a potential
threat to Muskie's pre-eminence in the
parly.
Student Support
All of these men can be expected to
reach the primaries, says Diamond.
They are such good men that they will
find support on a first come, first serve
basis, especially among students.
Former head of the BSU, Leo
Ba/.ile, met Muskie in Sacramento. Of
Muskie and McGovern he said, "I don't
care anything about them, one or the
other."But he adds, "I know definitely
that both of them will be better than
Nixon."
Stanford professors who have been
approached to work for one of the
candidates—speech-writing or authoring
position papers—have remained largely
neutral or undecided. The public seems
to be taking the same attitude. They
are waiting for a winner.
Diamond, who is working for
McGovern, says"I think there's a lot of
support out there for McGovern. But

people don't think he's going to win."
Those who are "issue-oriented," a
likely euphemism for Nixon haters, are
giving the most likely candidate time to
prove his strength. There is no reason
to expect a runaway candidate to
emerge now or even within a year.
"Depth of commitment is something
that grows as the time frame before the
convention shortens," Muskie told a
reporter during his visit to California.
"To expect people across the whole
political spectrum to agree on one man
at this point is expecting too much."
