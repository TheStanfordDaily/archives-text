## SRI War Games At Computation Center 
### 
The Stanford Research
Institute is using the University's
Computation Center to develop
assault plans for amphibious
warfare.
GAMUT-H is a computer
program described as an "analysis
of helicopter operations." The
program, discovered in the
Computation Center by the
Inquisition, is a simulation of an
amphibious assault designed
toward optimum speed and
efficiency in the deployment of
helicopters carrying vehicles,
troops and artillery. Printed out in
the listing of the program is SRl's
full name and address, plus the
name of the programmer, who is
Andrew Grant, of SRl's
Transportation and Losistics
department.

Mr. Grant's work is funded
under a continuing contract
between SRl's Naval Warfare
Research Center and the Defense
Department's Office of Naval
Research. His research in this area
has already resulted in a report
dealing with "Amphibious Assault
Logistics;" previously he authored
an Army report entitled "A Porter
Supply Computations Method for
Southeast Asia."
Three types of ships and six
types of helicopters are used in
the simulated assault. The ships
are represented in GAMUT-H as
LHA, LPD, and LPH, which,
according to the Navy, designate
"general purpose assault ship,"
"amphibious transport dock," and
"amphibious assault ship,"
respectively. The purpose of the
LPH is to "transport and land
troops and their essential
helicopter transportable
equipment and supplies by means
of embarked helicopters in
amphibious assaults."
The helicopters are listed in the
program as the HLH, CH4 6,
CHS3, UH-1, AH-1, and UH-111.
The first three choppers, known
respectively as the Heavy Lift
Helicopter, the Chinook, and the
Super Jolly Green Giant, are
transport helicopters "used to
provide combat and combat
service support. In this capacity
the (helicopter) lifts artillery,
ammunition, guncrews, supplies,

material, and other equipment in
support of Army forces in
combat."
The UN-1 N is described by the
Navy as a "Marine Corps light
transport," designed for "all
weather of troops,
equipment, and cargo in
amphibious assault and
subsequent operations ashore." It
"can also be used as a
gunship ..."
The UH-1 "Iroquois" is
primarily a troop-carrying
helicopter, while the AH-1
"Cobra" is an attack helicopter,
or "gunship," designed for
"armed reconnaissance, armed
escort, and direct fire support."
The Iroquois and the Cobra are
spearheading the current invasion
of Laos and Cambodia.
Most of these helicopters have
been used extensively in
Southeast Asia for several years,
providing the "vertical mobility"
fundamental to counterinsurgency
warfare techniques developed for
the Pentagon by think-tanks such
as the Hudson Institute and SRI.
GAMUT-H is an exercise in
"war gaming," defined by the
Association of Old Crows as "a
simulation by whatever means, of
a military operation involving two
or more opposing forces,
conducted using rules, data and
procedures designed to depict an
actual or assumed real world
situation." The objective of a war

game is to explore possible
alternatives in strategy and tactics
so as to be able to formulate the
most effective battle plan tor a
particular military situation.
Considered in the analysis are
such factors as weapons
availability and reliability, troop
strength, weather, terrain, and
supplies.
Modern war gaming was
conceived during World War 11,
when scientists developed
operations research, a technique
for dealing with numerous
situational parameters in a refined
quantitative manner. But the
limitations of war gaming began
to be felt in the 1 950 's when
military planners found
themselves faced with an
overwhelming amount of data and
a bewildering variety of choices,
as military technology increased
in complexity and America
adopted the concept of policing
the globe. Generals began playing
with computers, and in the 1960's
Robert McNamara's "Whiz Kids"
established once and for all the
role of computerized operations
research techniques in military
planning. Today war games are
used for everything from planning
the use of helicopter gunships for
destroying Vietnamese guerillas,
to determining the best way to
end the world, as in DOD's war
game called Simulation of Total
Atomic Global Exchange
(STAGE).
Like the other branches of the
military, the Marines found that
increasingly unwieldly problems
could not be solved by moving
around little markers. But because
in general "the Marines have a

lew lingg

sturdy contempt for computers,"
they apparently chose not to run
their own computer games; and
now the Stanford Research
Institute is simulating amphibious
assaults. SRI is quite experienced
in this area; according to Wilson,
Defense and Aviation
Correspondent for the Observer,
"it has major programs involving
the use of war games in
anti-ballistic missile defense, air
defense, naval warfare, and
unconventional (i.e.,
counterinsurgency) warfare."
As indicated by parameters in
the program, SRl's war game deals
with variables such as
"penetration distances,"
helicopter capacities and speeds,
travel time to "beach area,"
"refueling time," "altitude of
operations above sea level,"
"force-effectiveness," and
"priority given to personnel and
artillery."

SRl's use of the Stanford
Computation Center for
debugging their war game is
another example of the
University's covert complicity
with the military-industrial
complex. The Inquisition asks the
Stanford Community to join in
the following demands: 1) the
University disclose all instances of
utilization of the Computation
Center and other Stanford
facilities by individuals or
institutions that are not
constituents of the University,
and 2) the University immediately
terminate all provisions for such
use on defense contracts.

in complexity and America
adopted the concept of policing
the globe. Generals began playing
with computers, and in the 1960's
Robert McNamara's "Whiz Kids"
established once and for all the
role of computerized operations
research techniques in military

in general "the Marines have a

sturdy contempt for computers,"
they apparently chose not to run
their own computer games; and
now the Stanford Research
Institute is simulating amphibious
assaults. SRI is quite experienced
in this area; according to Wilson,
Defense and Aviation
Correspondent for the Observer,
"it has major programs involving
the use of war games in
anti-ballistic missile defense, air
defense, naval warfare, and
unconventional (i.e.,
counterinsurgency) warfare."
As indicated by parameters in
the program, SRl's war game deals
with variables such as
"penetration distances,"
helicopter capacities and speeds,
travel time to "beach area,"
"refueling time," "altitude of
operations above sea level,"
"force-effectiveness," and
"priority given to personnel and

now the Stanford Research
Institute is simulating amphibious

in this area; according to Wilson,
Defense and Aviation
Correspondent for the Observer,
"it has major programs involving
the use of war games in
anti-ballistic missile defense, air
defense, naval warfare, and
unconventional (i.e.,
counterinsurgency) warfare."
As indicated by parameters in
the program, SRl's war game deals
with variables such as
"penetration distances,"
helicopter capacities and speeds,
travel time to "beach area,"
"refueling time," "altitude of
operations above sea level,"
"force-effectiveness," and
"priority given to personnel and
artillery."

The Stanford Research
Institute is using the University's
Computation Center to develop
assault plans for amphibious
warfare.
GAMUT-H is a computer
program described as an "analysis
of helicopter operations." The
program, discovered in the
Computation Center by the
Inquisition, is a simulation of an
amphibious assault designed
toward optimum speed and
efficiency in the deployment of
helicopters carrying vehicles,
troops and artillery. Printed out in
the listing of the program is SRl's
full name and address, plus the
name of the programmer, who is
Andrew Grant, of SRl's
Transportation and Losistics
department.

Mr. Grant's work is funded
under a continuing contract
between SRl's Naval Warfare
Research Center and the Defense
Department's Office of Naval
Research. His research in this area
has already resulted in a report
dealing with "Amphibious Assault
Logistics;" previously he authored
an Army report entitled "A Porter
Supply Computations Method for
Southeast Asia."
Three types of ships and six
types of helicopters are used in
the simulated assault. The ships
are represented in GAMUT-H as
LHA, LPD, and LPH, which,
according to the Navy, designate
"general purpose assault ship,"
"amphibious transport dock," and
"amphibious assault ship,"
respectively. The purpose of the
LPH is to "transport and land
troops and their essential
helicopter transportable
equipment and supplies by means
of embarked helicopters in
amphibious assaults."
The helicopters are listed in the
program as the HLH, CH4 6,
CHS3, UH-1, AH-1, and UH-111.
The first three choppers, known
respectively as the Heavy Lift
Helicopter, the Chinook, and the
Super Jolly Green Giant, are
transport helicopters "used to
provide combat and combat
service support. In this capacity
the (helicopter) lifts artillery,
ammunition, guncrews, supplies,

material, and other equipment in
support of Army forces in
combat."
The UN-1 N is described by the
Navy as a "Marine Corps light
transport," designed for "all
weather of troops,
equipment, and cargo in
amphibious assault and
subsequent operations ashore." It
"can also be used as a
gunship ..."
The UH-1 "Iroquois" is
primarily a troop-carrying
helicopter, while the AH-1
"Cobra" is an attack helicopter,
or "gunship," designed for
"armed reconnaissance, armed
escort, and direct fire support."
The Iroquois and the Cobra are
spearheading the current invasion
of Laos and Cambodia.
Most of these helicopters have
been used extensively in
Southeast Asia for several years,
providing the "vertical mobility"
fundamental to counterinsurgency
warfare techniques developed for
the Pentagon by think-tanks such
as the Hudson Institute and SRI.
GAMUT-H is an exercise in
"war gaming," defined by the
Association of Old Crows as "a
simulation by whatever means, of
a military operation involving two
or more opposing forces,
conducted using rules, data and
procedures designed to depict an
actual or assumed real world
situation." The objective of a war

game is to explore possible
alternatives in strategy and tactics
so as to be able to formulate the
most effective battle plan tor a
particular military situation.
Considered in the analysis are
such factors as weapons
availability and reliability, troop
strength, weather, terrain, and
supplies.
Modern war gaming was
conceived during World War 11,
when scientists developed
operations research, a technique
for dealing with numerous
situational parameters in a refined
quantitative manner. But the
limitations of war gaming began
to be felt in the 1 950 's when
military planners found
themselves faced with an
overwhelming amount of data and
a bewildering variety of choices,
as military technology increased
in complexity and America
adopted the concept of policing
the globe. Generals began playing
with computers, and in the 1960's
Robert McNamara's "Whiz Kids"
established once and for all the
role of computerized operations
research techniques in military
planning. Today war games are
used for everything from planning
the use of helicopter gunships for
destroying Vietnamese guerillas,
to determining the best way to
end the world, as in DOD's war
