Laos Invasion
SAIGON — South Vietnamese forces drove 10 miles
into southern Laos yesterday and set up a fire base
about a third of the way to their apparent objective-a
key supply junction on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, field
dispatches reported.
They said the forces advancing across South
Vietnam's northwest border met only light resistance.
But heavy anti-aircraft fire greeted the initial
waves of airborne troops and four U.S. helicopters
were reported shot down. Two others crashed
because of mechanical difficulties the dispatches said,
but the crews of all six were rescued.
The American helicopters either ferried South
Vietnamese troops into Laos or supported their
ground operations. No U.S. ground troops were
involved, the U.S. Command said.
U.S. helicopter gunships crews reported destroying
rice and other supplies as anti-aircraft weapons in the
operations area.
About 1 4 0 U.S. helicopters took part in the initial
assault. In addition, 9,000 American troops are
participating in the operation as a blocking force
inside South Vietnam. The U.S. Command repeated
that no American ground troops would enter Laos.
Invasion Protest
WASHINGTON — Senate doves yesterday attacked
the South Vietnamese drive into Laos as a widening
of the war. But initial reaction generally was muted
compared to the protests that followed the U.S. move
into Cambodia last year.
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told newsmen
the Laos drive "violates the spirit if not the letter of
the amendments that passed the Senate."

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D- Minn., said the
implications "are enormously dangerous for both the
United States and South Vietnam as well as for the
Kingdom of Laos and other countries of Southeast
Asia." Humphrey said "this invasion represents a
stepping up instead of a toning down of the war."
Nevertheless, the United States declared in a
policy statement that the strike, which is being
supported by U.S. air power, is a limited operation
and "not an enlargement of the war."
State Department press officer Robert J.
McCloskey said the United States would like to see a
new international conference called to make peace in
Indochina. He said also the Nixon administration is
considering making a report to the United Nations
Security Council on the South Vietnamese drive
against Communist position in Laos.
Ireland Riots
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Rioting and
submachine-gun fire exploded in Belfast last night
after a British army scout car ran over and killed a
5-year-old girl playing in the street.
Four other children were wounded when
submachine gun bullets sprayed a street in a nearby
district.
Crowds set fire to nine trucks, cars and a bus, and
the army rushed reinforcements into the trouble area.
British forces dug in for what they foresee as a
prolonged and bloody battle with guerrilla gunmen
determined to end the partition of Ireland and bring
largely Protestant province under control of the
Roman Catholic republic to the south. Military
authorities believe the weekend of rioting in which at
least six men died is only the beginning of a new and
grimmer phase of street warfare involving the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.

Priest Arraigned
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan,
imprisoned antiwar priest, and five other persons
pleaded innocent yesterday to charges of conspiring
to kidnap presidential adviser Henry Kissinger and
blow up heating tunnels in the nation's capital.
Tight security prevailed through the federal
building as the 4 7 -year-old Josephite priest was led by
federal marshals before Judge R. Dixon Herman of
U.S. District Court.
Father Berrigan, a Roman Catholic, was brought
here in handcuffs from the federal correctional
institution at Danbury, Conn. He is serving a 3 1/2
year term for destroying draft board records.
The other defendants, all free on bail, included
two priests, a nun, a former priest who is married to
an ex-nun, and a Pakistani graduate student. Bail was
continued.
Pollution Battle
WASHINGTON — President Nixon proposed
yesterday strong new enforcement powers for the
Environmental Protection Agency to combat water
pollution, ocean dumping, excessive noise, and the
misuse of pesticides and other poisons.
Enforcement recommendations were coupled with
proposals to tax air-polluting sulphur in fuels and lead
in gasoline, evidence of Nixon's stated goal of making
market forces work against pollution.
He called also for a national land-use policy
designed to encourage the states to set up
environment-protecting programs.
The chief executive gave no over-all cost estimates
for his comprehensive package.

the Laos drive "violates the spirit if not the letter of
the amendments that passed the Senate."

Sen. Hubert H. Humphrey, D- Minn., said the
implications "are enormously dangerous for both the
United States and South Vietnam as well as for the
Kingdom of Laos and other countries of Southeast
Asia." Humphrey said "this invasion represents a
stepping up instead of a toning down of the war."
Nevertheless, the United States declared in a
policy statement that the strike, which is being
supported by U.S. air power, is a limited operation
and "not an enlargement of the war."
State Department press officer Robert J.
McCloskey said the United States would like to see a
new international conference called to make peace in
Indochina. He said also the Nixon administration is
considering making a report to the United Nations
Security Council on the South Vietnamese drive
against Communist position in Laos.
Ireland Riots
BELFAST, Northern Ireland — Rioting and
submachine-gun fire exploded in Belfast last night
after a British army scout car ran over and killed a
5-year-old girl playing in the street.
Four other children were wounded when
submachine gun bullets sprayed a street in a nearby
district.
Crowds set fire to nine trucks, cars and a bus, and
the army rushed reinforcements into the trouble area.
British forces dug in for what they foresee as a
prolonged and bloody battle with guerrilla gunmen
determined to end the partition of Ireland and bring
largely Protestant province under control of the
Roman Catholic republic to the south. Military
authorities believe the weekend of rioting in which at
least six men died is only the beginning of a new and
grimmer phase of street warfare involving the
outlawed Irish Republican Army.

Priest Arraigned
HARRISBURG, Pa. — The Rev. Philip Berrigan,
imprisoned antiwar priest, and five other persons
pleaded innocent yesterday to charges of conspiring
to kidnap presidential adviser Henry Kissinger and
blow up heating tunnels in the nation's capital.
Tight security prevailed through the federal
building as the 4 7 -year-old Josephite priest was led by
federal marshals before Judge R. Dixon Herman of
U.S. District Court.
Father Berrigan, a Roman Catholic, was brought
here in handcuffs from the federal correctional
institution at Danbury, Conn. He is serving a 3 1/2
year term for destroying draft board records.
The other defendants, all free on bail, included
two priests, a nun, a former priest who is married to
an ex-nun, and a Pakistani graduate student. Bail was
continued.
Pollution Battle
WASHINGTON — President Nixon proposed
yesterday strong new enforcement powers for the
Environmental Protection Agency to combat water
pollution, ocean dumping, excessive noise, and the
misuse of pesticides and other poisons.
Enforcement recommendations were coupled with
proposals to tax air-polluting sulphur in fuels and lead
in gasoline, evidence of Nixon's stated goal of making
market forces work against pollution.
He called also for a national land-use policy
designed to encourage the states to set up
environment-protecting programs.
The chief executive gave no over-all cost estimates
for his comprehensive package.
Laos Invasion
SAIGON — South Vietnamese forces drove 10 miles
into southern Laos yesterday and set up a fire base
about a third of the way to their apparent objective-a
key supply junction on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, field
dispatches reported.
They said the forces advancing across South
Vietnam's northwest border met only light resistance.
But heavy anti-aircraft fire greeted the initial
waves of airborne troops and four U.S. helicopters
were reported shot down. Two others crashed
because of mechanical difficulties the dispatches said,
but the crews of all six were rescued.
The American helicopters either ferried South
Vietnamese troops into Laos or supported their
ground operations. No U.S. ground troops were
involved, the U.S. Command said.
U.S. helicopter gunships crews reported destroying
rice and other supplies as anti-aircraft weapons in the
operations area.
About 1 4 0 U.S. helicopters took part in the initial
assault. In addition, 9,000 American troops are
participating in the operation as a blocking force
inside South Vietnam. The U.S. Command repeated
that no American ground troops would enter Laos.
Invasion Protest
WASHINGTON — Senate doves yesterday attacked
the South Vietnamese drive into Laos as a widening
of the war. But initial reaction generally was muted
compared to the protests that followed the U.S. move
into Cambodia last year.
