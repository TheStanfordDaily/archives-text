Today In The 'Daily 9
On this day in 1950, the Nationalist Chinese government
extended its naval blockade to cover the entire coast of
mainland China. It must have been successful, for to this day,
the Communists have been unable to establish a government
there;at least, that's what they've been saying in Washington.
If you want to announce your own blockades - of
Monterey, Greece, or the city of Cleveland, let us know at the
editorial office at x4632.
It you have some autographed pictures of Chaing, or some
Nationalist war bonds to unload, give the Business Office your
business at 327-4150.
