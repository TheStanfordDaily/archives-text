# Meeting Calls For Strike, Plans Noon Rally Today
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
University protest against the
invasion of Laos culminated in a near
unanimous student strike vote by 25 0
students and community people at a
meeting in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night. The strike will begin at noon
today with a rally in White Plaza.
The decision to strike grew out of a
discussion of United States expansion
of the Indochinese war and of the role
Stanford plays in the war effort. The
strike is based on three demands:
—The United States leave Southeast
Asia now.
—University participation in the war
effort be stopped.
—All political prisoners be freed.
After the noon rally tomorrow,
strikers will begin a roving attempt to
shut down various University
departments. The first targets of the
strike will probably be the computation
center and the Hoover Institute.
Staff Meeting
In addition to the student rally,
library workers and other Stanford
staff will have an open meeting in front
of the Main Library to discuss what

action they should take in response to
the strike.
In addition to the three general
demands set down at last night's
meeting, seven other proposals were
adopted for a strike platform. The
seven proposals are:
—Support of the Black Student
Union demands for an open meeting
with President Lyman.
—Allow free access to information
about Stanford programs relating to the
INdochina war.
—abolish the Stanford Judicial
Council.
—Grant amnesty for Bruce Franklin.
—Grant amnesty for the other SJC
defendants.
—Remove all occupation troops
from the Stanford campus.
—Reinstate John Keilch., a Stanford
library employee soon to be suspended
from his job for his alledged connection
with the Lodge disruption.
—Impliment changes in the Stanford
community so that the University will
"serve the people."
The adoption of the 7 point platform
grew out of much confusion at the
community meeting as to what the
demands of the strike should be. Many

felt that all seven platform proposals
should be included in the three general
demands, while others at the meeting
argued that the general demands should
be the only statement issued by the
group so that other Universities could
follow the general outline of the
Stanford strike.
The three demands issued last night
are essentially the same demands issued
last spring by the strike committee at
Yale.
Half Go Home
The decision to strike was made by
about half of the original crowd in
Dinkelspiel. Confusion over what
demands should and should not be
included in any policy statement and
much disagreement over whether or not
a strike should be called caused much
of Dink crowd to dissipate before the
vote was taken.
The alternative action of occupying
the Computation Center caused
disagreement among those present. SJC
defendant, Janet Weiss led the
discussion in favor of strike, pointing
out the possibili'y of moving the strike
from building to building as it increased
in size.
Other speakers argued that the strike
should be called for only one day in an
effort to build a stronger base for
future actions, but the decision was to
set no time limit.
Presidents Opposed
Reaction to the strike decision was
mixed around campus last night. The
ASSU Council of Presidents issued a
statement after the decision in which
they vowed the University will be kept
open.
English Prof. Bruce Franklin spoke
in favor of the strike last night saying,
"We should take action right here on
the University because the""war is
being waged by the Stanford Board of
Trustees and the others of their same
social class."

demands set down at last night's
meeting, seven other proposals were
adopted for a strike platform. The
seven proposals are:
—Support of the Black Student
Union demands for an open meeting
with President Lyman.
—Allow free access to information
about Stanford programs relating to the
INdochina war.
—abolish the Stanford Judicial
Council.
—Grant amnesty for Bruce Franklin.
—Grant amnesty for the other SJC
defendants.
—Remove all occupation troops
from the Stanford campus.
—Reinstate John Keilch., a Stanford
library employee soon to be suspended
from his job for his alledged connection
with the Lodge disruption.
—Impliment changes in the Stanford
community so that the University will
"serve the people."
The adoption of the 7 point platform
grew out of much confusion at the
community meeting as to what the
demands of the strike should be. Many

felt that all seven platform proposals
should be included in the three general
demands, while others at the meeting
argued that the general demands should
be the only statement issued by the
group so that other Universities could
follow the general outline of the
Stanford strike.
The three demands issued last night
are essentially the same demands issued
last spring by the strike committee at
Yale.
Half Go Home
The decision to strike was made by
about half of the original crowd in
Dinkelspiel. Confusion over what
demands should and should not be
included in any policy statement and
much disagreement over whether or not
a strike should be called caused much
of Dink crowd to dissipate before the
vote was taken.
The alternative action of occupying
the Computation Center caused
disagreement among those present. SJC
defendant, Janet Weiss led the
discussion in favor of strike, pointing
out the possibili'y of moving the strike
from building to building as it increased
in size.
Other speakers argued that the strike
should be called for only one day in an
effort to build a stronger base for
future actions, but the decision was to
set no time limit.
Presidents Opposed
Reaction to the strike decision was
mixed around campus last night. The
ASSU Council of Presidents issued a
statement after the decision in which
they vowed the University will be kept
open.
English Prof. Bruce Franklin spoke
in favor of the strike last night saying,
"We should take action right here on
the University because the""war is
being waged by the Stanford Board of
Trustees and the others of their same
social class."
University protest against the
invasion of Laos culminated in a near
unanimous student strike vote by 25 0
students and community people at a
meeting in Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night. The strike will begin at noon
today with a rally in White Plaza.
The decision to strike grew out of a
discussion of United States expansion
of the Indochinese war and of the role
Stanford plays in the war effort. The
strike is based on three demands:
—The United States leave Southeast
Asia now.
—University participation in the war
effort be stopped.
—All political prisoners be freed.
After the noon rally tomorrow,
strikers will begin a roving attempt to
shut down various University
departments. The first targets of the
strike will probably be the computation
center and the Hoover Institute.
Staff Meeting
In addition to the student rally,
library workers and other Stanford
staff will have an open meeting in front
of the Main Library to discuss what

action they should take in response to
the strike.
In addition to the three general
demands set down at last night's
