Editor, THE DAILY:
Some people, and I find it hard
to believe that they are dedicated
radicals, are trying to destroy our
university. I abhor the invasion of
Cambodia, I abhor the criminal
insanity of our new involvement
in Laos, I am horrified by almost
everything our government says or
does - but taking out these hatreds
against Stanford University - it's
almost equally insane. This place,
along with other universities, is
almost our last hope. It's
practically the only refuge for
sanity and decency and
compassion left in this country.
When enough windows have been
broken and enough firebombs
thrown there will be nothing left,
absolutely nothing.
Sure this place makes mistakes,
sure there are legitimate
grievances against the
administration. But for every one
of these errors there must be 100
occasions when the University has
behaved with a sense of fairness
and a rationality that characterize
few bureaucracies in the world.
Throw enough rocks and this will
die.
I'm afraid I don't know what
to do to make that deaf man in
the White House listen to the
people. But anyone who is
dedicated to peace, dedicated to
creating a life in which there are
alternatives to corporate
swindling, must see that
destroying the best of what we
now have is not the right path.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In the course of our
investigations into Stanford's
complicity in the American
policies of economic and military
domination of Southeast Asia, we
have uncovered the fact that
Stanford University is allowing its
Computation Center to be used
by the Stanford Research
Institute for war research. The use

of the computer for debugging
Andrew Grant's simulation of an
amphibious assault demonstrates a
complicity which is intolerable
and must be terminated
immediately. In order to
determine the extent of
Stanford's involvement in war
research, we ask the Stanford
Community to join in the
following demands of the
University Administration:
1. All instances of utilization
of the Computation Center and
other Stanford facilities, such as
the libraries, by individuals or
institutions that are not
constituents of the University,
must be made public.
2. All provisions for the use of
these facilities on defense
contracts be terminated
immediately.
3. All information on faculty
consulting work for government,
foundations, and industry be
made public.
4. All information concerning
the nature of the research funded
by government, industry,and
foundations be made public.
Specifically we want the research
abstracts containing discussions of
the possible military and civilian
applications.
5. All connections with outside
institutions that are directly or
indirectly involved in the War
must be severed immediately.
6. All research funded by the
Department of Defense, and other
research that contributes in any
way to the United States military
posture in Southeast Asia, be
phased out beginning now.
We ask for an immediate reply
to these demands. All responses
should be sent to the Inquisition
in care of ASSU.
The Inquisition
neutrality ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems to me that, in theory,
the university should be a haven
of neutrality; and that as a result
of this admitted assumption, the
determination of what is taught,
what is not taught, who can teach,
who cannot teach, who can speak,

and who cannot speak can bear no
relation to any political structure
or moral structure which exists
"out in society."
Under this basis, Henry Cabot
Lodge has a right to speak on this
campus (for that matter Adolf
Hitler has a right to speak on this
campus.) Under this basis, Angela
Davis, for instance has every bit as
much right to teach as Ronald
Reagan or Hubert Humphrey
would.
The university has a right to
teach business but may not be
one. The university has a right to
teach Marx but may not be
Marxist. In other words, the
university should be a place where
the rules of society don't hold.
And under this basis any response
by the students and faculty
concerning the Laos invasion
should occur outside the campus.
There is a slight catch, though.
The university is not neutral. Its
non-neutrality is so extensive that
it is almost illogical to say the
university can even give the
pretense of being neutral.
Regents profit from the war; an
ex-regent heads the Pentagon;
SRI designs missle systems for the
government; Hoover Tower,
Industrial Park, etc., etc., ad
nauseum.
And so, while I don't throw
bricks and sieze buildings I can
only say, "What do you want?"
Do not argue for neutrality unless
neutrality can exist. Neutrality is
a farce and you only reap what
you sow.

neutrality ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems to me that, in theory,
the university should be a haven
of neutrality; and that as a result
of this admitted assumption, the
determination of what is taught,
what is not taught, who can teach,
who cannot teach, who can speak,

and who cannot speak can bear no
relation to any political structure
or moral structure which exists
"out in society."
Under this basis, Henry Cabot
Lodge has a right to speak on this
campus (for that matter Adolf
Hitler has a right to speak on this
campus.) Under this basis, Angela
Davis, for instance has every bit as
much right to teach as Ronald
Reagan or Hubert Humphrey
would.
The university has a right to
teach business but may not be
one. The university has a right to
teach Marx but may not be
Marxist. In other words, the
university should be a place where
the rules of society don't hold.
And under this basis any response
by the students and faculty
concerning the Laos invasion
should occur outside the campus.
There is a slight catch, though.
The university is not neutral. Its
non-neutrality is so extensive that
it is almost illogical to say the
university can even give the
pretense of being neutral.
Regents profit from the war; an
ex-regent heads the Pentagon;
SRI designs missle systems for the
government; Hoover Tower,
Industrial Park, etc., etc., ad
nauseum.
And so, while I don't throw
bricks and sieze buildings I can
only say, "What do you want?"
Do not argue for neutrality unless
neutrality can exist. Neutrality is
a farce and you only reap what
you sow.

Some people, and I find it hard
to believe that they are dedicated
radicals, are trying to destroy our
university. I abhor the invasion of
Cambodia, I abhor the criminal
insanity of our new involvement
in Laos, I am horrified by almost
everything our government says or
does - but taking out these hatreds
against Stanford University - it's
almost equally insane. This place,
along with other universities, is
almost our last hope. It's
practically the only refuge for
sanity and decency and
compassion left in this country.
When enough windows have been
broken and enough firebombs
thrown there will be nothing left,
absolutely nothing.
Sure this place makes mistakes,
sure there are legitimate
grievances against the
administration. But for every one
of these errors there must be 100
occasions when the University has
behaved with a sense of fairness
and a rationality that characterize
few bureaucracies in the world.
Throw enough rocks and this will
die.
I'm afraid I don't know what
to do to make that deaf man in
the White House listen to the
people. But anyone who is
dedicated to peace, dedicated to
creating a life in which there are
alternatives to corporate
swindling, must see that
destroying the best of what we
now have is not the right path.

In the course of our
investigations into Stanford's
complicity in the American
policies of economic and military
domination of Southeast Asia, we
have uncovered the fact that
Stanford University is allowing its
Computation Center to be used
by the Stanford Research
Institute for war research. The use

of the computer for debugging
Andrew Grant's simulation of an
amphibious assault demonstrates a
complicity which is intolerable
and must be terminated
immediately. In order to
determine the extent of
Stanford's involvement in war
research, we ask the Stanford
Community to join in the
following demands of the
University Administration:
1. All instances of utilization
of the Computation Center and
other Stanford facilities, such as
the libraries, by individuals or
institutions that are not
constituents of the University,
must be made public.
2. All provisions for the use of
these facilities on defense
contracts be terminated
immediately.
3. All information on faculty
consulting work for government,
foundations, and industry be
made public.
4. All information concerning
the nature of the research funded
by government, industry,and
foundations be made public.
Specifically we want the research
abstracts containing discussions of
the possible military and civilian
applications.
5. All connections with outside
institutions that are directly or
indirectly involved in the War
must be severed immediately.
6. All research funded by the
Department of Defense, and other
research that contributes in any
way to the United States military
posture in Southeast Asia, be

and a rationality that characterize
few bureaucracies in the world.
Throw enough rocks and this will
die.
I'm afraid I don't know what
to do to make that deaf man in
the White House listen to the
people. But anyone who is
dedicated to peace, dedicated to
creating a life in which there are
alternatives to corporate
swindling, must see that
destroying the best of what we
now have is not the right path.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In the course of our
investigations into Stanford's
complicity in the American
policies of economic and military
domination of Southeast Asia, we
have uncovered the fact that
Stanford University is allowing its
Computation Center to be used
by the Stanford Research
Institute for war research. The use

of the computer for debugging
Andrew Grant's simulation of an
amphibious assault demonstrates a
complicity which is intolerable
and must be terminated
immediately. In order to
determine the extent of
Stanford's involvement in war
research, we ask the Stanford
Community to join in the
following demands of the
University Administration:
1. All instances of utilization
of the Computation Center and
other Stanford facilities, such as
the libraries, by individuals or
institutions that are not
constituents of the University,
must be made public.
2. All provisions for the use of
these facilities on defense
contracts be terminated
immediately.
3. All information on faculty
consulting work for government,
foundations, and industry be
made public.
4. All information concerning
the nature of the research funded
by government, industry,and
foundations be made public.
Specifically we want the research
abstracts containing discussions of
the possible military and civilian
applications.
5. All connections with outside
institutions that are directly or
indirectly involved in the War
must be severed immediately.
6. All research funded by the
Department of Defense, and other
research that contributes in any
way to the United States military
posture in Southeast Asia, be
phased out beginning now.
We ask for an immediate reply
to these demands. All responses
should be sent to the Inquisition
in care of ASSU.

neutrality ?
Editor, THE DAILY:
It seems to me that, in theory,
the university should be a haven
of neutrality; and that as a result
of this admitted assumption, the
determination of what is taught,
what is not taught, who can teach,
who cannot teach, who can speak,

and who cannot speak can bear no
relation to any political structure
or moral structure which exists
"out in society."
Under this basis, Henry Cabot
Lodge has a right to speak on this
campus (for that matter Adolf
Hitler has a right to speak on this
campus.) Under this basis, Angela
Davis, for instance has every bit as
much right to teach as Ronald
Reagan or Hubert Humphrey
would.
The university has a right to
teach business but may not be
one. The university has a right to
teach Marx but may not be
Marxist. In other words, the
university should be a place where
the rules of society don't hold.
And under this basis any response
by the students and faculty
concerning the Laos invasion
should occur outside the campus.
There is a slight catch, though.
The university is not neutral. Its
non-neutrality is so extensive that
it is almost illogical to say the
university can even give the
pretense of being neutral.
Regents profit from the war; an
ex-regent heads the Pentagon;
SRI designs missle systems for the
government; Hoover Tower,
Industrial Park, etc., etc., ad
nauseum.
And so, while I don't throw
bricks and sieze buildings I can
only say, "What do you want?"
Do not argue for neutrality unless
neutrality can exist. Neutrality is
a farce and you only reap what
you sow.
