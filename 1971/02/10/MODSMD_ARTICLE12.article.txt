## Revive The Movement 
### 
bob grant, larry diamond

The invasion of Laos by allied
forces has pluged the war in
Southeast Asia into another crisis
situation. We believe that crisis
must be met with a vigorous and
immediate resurgence of the
movement to end the war.
American air power pounds
away at targets throughout all of
Indochina, now in direct support
of still another invasion. The only
reason that American ground
troops have not entered Cambodia
is the Cooper-Church amendment,
which was passed last year only
after extensive public protest over
the Cambodia invasion. And the
only way in which future
invasions can be prevented and
swift American withdrawal
achieved is by more legislation.
Congress must deny the President
the unilateral power to send U.S.
troops wherever he chooses or
support invasions planned by us
and executed by our allies.
Congress must require by
legislation the withdrawal of all
American troops by the end ol
this year. If the war is to end,
Congress must be our ultimate
focus.
Moving Congress
If Congress is to be moved to
end the war, it must be affected
by the community, both here in
the Mid-Peninsula and across the
country, as well as the
universities. But the very people
in that community that we must
attract will be repelled if we reach
out to them from a campus that is
shut down or racked by violence.
The entire tactic of violence
and disruption advocated by the
junior revolutionaries has to be
rejected. Trashing by the radicals
is futile self indulgence. It is worse
than futile; it is counter
productive. It destroys resources
that could be used to support vital
educational programs, such as
scholarships for minorities.
Someone pays for the destruction

and seldom is it the wealthy white
radicals. In addition, public
attention is distracted from the
concern which is in all our
minds—the Viet Nam war and
instead focused on the mindless
window breaking.
Without shutting the
University down and without
using violent, disruptive, or
coercive tactics we can reach out
again to the people off campus
and through them, and through
petitions, letters, phone calls and
all the variety of means of
bringing public opinion to bear on
Congress and the President, we
can achieve the legislation
necessary to end this war.

Toward accomplishing that
purpose, we organized discussions
in the dorms Monday night with
members of the faculty and
Administration so students could
consider- the meaning of the
Laotian invasion and alternatives
for constructive action to oppose
it. In addition we are raising
$2600 as soon as possible for a
full page ad in the Washington
Post calling on Congress to forbid
"American participation in or
support of any further invasion of
any country in Indochina" and
adopt the McGovern-Hatfield
amendment to end the war by the
end of this year.
The text of the ad is also being
circulated as petitions on which
we hope to get several thousand
signatures.
Finally, we are urging students
to begin a massive letter writing
campaign to impress on the
Congress and the President the
strength of the opposition to the
invasion and the continuation of
the war.

These initial steps have been
taken. More needs to be done. We
must activate some large portion
of the 73 percent of the American
public that now stands with us in
favor of a total withdrawal from
all of Indochina by the end of this
year. We must revive the network
of community action that was so
effective last Spring.

To do this we need your help.
There will be a meeting tonight at
7 :30 in Twain Lounge of Stern to
plan, to create, and to
begin. (Bob Grant is one of the
ASSU Council of Presidents.

than futile; it is counter
productive. It destroys resources
that could be used to support vital
educational programs, such as
scholarships for minorities.
Someone pays for the destruction

and seldom is it the wealthy white
radicals. In addition, public
attention is distracted from the
concern which is in all our
minds—the Viet Nam war and
instead focused on the mindless
window breaking.
Without shutting the
University down and without
using violent, disruptive, or
coercive tactics we can reach out
again to the people off campus
and through them, and through
petitions, letters, phone calls and
all the variety of means of
bringing public opinion to bear on
Congress and the President, we
can achieve the legislation
necessary to end this war.

Toward accomplishing that
purpose, we organized discussions
in the dorms Monday night with
members of the faculty and
Administration so students could
consider- the meaning of the
Laotian invasion and alternatives
for constructive action to oppose
it. In addition we are raising
$2600 as soon as possible for a
full page ad in the Washington
Post calling on Congress to forbid
"American participation in or
support of any further invasion of
any country in Indochina" and
adopt the McGovern-Hatfield
amendment to end the war by the
end of this year.
The text of the ad is also being
circulated as petitions on which
we hope to get several thousand
signatures.
Finally, we are urging students
to begin a massive letter writing
campaign to impress on the
Congress and the President the
strength of the opposition to the
invasion and the continuation of
the war.

These initial steps have been
taken. More needs to be done. We
must activate some large portion
of the 73 percent of the American
public that now stands with us in
favor of a total withdrawal from
all of Indochina by the end of this
year. We must revive the network
of community action that was so
effective last Spring.

To do this we need your help.
There will be a meeting tonight at
7 :30 in Twain Lounge of Stern to
plan, to create, and to
begin. (Bob Grant is one of the

The invasion of Laos by allied
forces has pluged the war in
Southeast Asia into another crisis
situation. We believe that crisis
must be met with a vigorous and
immediate resurgence of the
movement to end the war.
American air power pounds
away at targets throughout all of
Indochina, now in direct support
of still another invasion. The only
reason that American ground
troops have not entered Cambodia
is the Cooper-Church amendment,
which was passed last year only
after extensive public protest over
the Cambodia invasion. And the
only way in which future
invasions can be prevented and
swift American withdrawal
achieved is by more legislation.
Congress must deny the President
the unilateral power to send U.S.
troops wherever he chooses or
support invasions planned by us
and executed by our allies.
Congress must require by
legislation the withdrawal of all
American troops by the end ol
this year. If the war is to end,
Congress must be our ultimate
focus.
Moving Congress
If Congress is to be moved to
end the war, it must be affected
by the community, both here in
the Mid-Peninsula and across the
country, as well as the
universities. But the very people
in that community that we must
attract will be repelled if we reach
out to them from a campus that is
shut down or racked by violence.
The entire tactic of violence
and disruption advocated by the
junior revolutionaries has to be
rejected. Trashing by the radicals
is futile self indulgence. It is worse
than futile; it is counter
productive. It destroys resources
that could be used to support vital
educational programs, such as
scholarships for minorities.
