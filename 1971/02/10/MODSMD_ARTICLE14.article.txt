# Blind Share In Life
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
For most Stanford students the
days are a montage of faces, trees,
buildings and books. People hang
around and watch the fountain
work or the sun set on the lake
with little thought to a world of
no color and light or the problem
of getting to classes with their
visual inputs curtailed.
There is however a handful of
students here who know darkness
as a way of lifeâ€”they are blind.
For them it is the number of
driveways, the texture of the
pavement, or the location of a
wall that orients them to their
classes. They must rely on the sun
on their faces, the grass beneath
their feet, and the smells of the
trees to appreciate the sunny
spring days at Stanford.
Being blind at Stanford is like
being blind anywhere, a problem
which must be lived with. Classes
and extra-curricular activities
demand a complete run of the
campus for all students so blind
students often employ the aid of a
mobility instructor when they
first arrive at Stanford to aid them
in the art of getting around solely
with the use of their canes and
their memories.
Mobility instructors are usually
people possessing master's degrees
who have had a social science
background at an undergraduate
level. In their master's training
they are taught to function
without the aid of their eyes so
they may aid blind students in
orienting themselves to a new
environment.
Beth Heisler, a Lambda Nu

coed, was aided by a mobility
instructor from the Palo Alto
Society for the Blind who came
on campus when she first arrived
at Stanford. With the aid of her
training and a cane she travels
from class to class with great
facility.
Guide Dog Problem
Beth has contemplated getting
a guide dog several times but has
never gotten one, since she has
found her cane and her friends
adequate on campus and even
when overseas at Stanford-in-
Germany."A dog is too much of a
responsibility and in some cases
can cause difficulty in a social
situation," says Beth. If she or
any of the other blind students on
campus desired a dog, there are
facilities in nearby San Rafael that
hold classes for dogs and their
masters, but most students seem
to prefer to take advantage of the
mobility instructors from the
Braille Institute or the State
Department of Rehabiliation.
Beth cited incidents where
total strangers have approached
her and expressed their
admiration that she is "so brave."
Beth emphasizes that mobility is
merely a part of life for her and
other blind students and that
overstressing normal functions
often builds up a stereotype of
blind students which sighted
people allow to interfere with
their knowing blind students on a
personal level.
"If people could just rap with
blind students for a few hours
they would realize that they are

real people with very normal
problems being worked out in
their heads and not heroes,"
continued Beth. "Being blind is
just another problem which can't
overshadow the normal student
problems of academics, life, and
love."
One of the primary pioblems
the blind student faces in relating
to the sighted student is the
failure of the sighted student to
realize that the blind student has
already learned to live with his
blindness and is not continually
fighting it. The more central
problem in the blind student's life
is more likely to be a pending
assignment, career choices, or a
boy/girl relationship.
Academics Difficult
The problem of academics can
be difficult since printed texts,
pictures, and diagrams are of use
to the student only through a
reader. Where books are on tape,
blind students can acquire them at
no charge from Recordings for the
Blind which is an organization
dedicated to the continuing
education of the blind through
the recording of primarily
textbooks.
Recordings for the Blind keeps
a large catalogue of tapes on file
at its main branch and will record
any book that is not already on
tape at the request of a student.
The readings are done by unpaid
volunteers and the organization is
sustained through voluntary
contributions. It has a branch here
in Palo Alto.
Notes are usually taken in
Braille. John Bancroft, a Twain
house junior, noted that one of
his courses, a class in judicial law,
has already yielded him "cartons
of notes." There is the
conspicuous presence of the stiff
manila colored braille pages all
over his room and stacks of tapes
piled on his shelves. When John
and others can't find books on
tape, they hire readers who read
the texts to them.
John noted that his
impressions of professors and
fellow students comes from the
more subtle vocal cues and
actions. In the absence of visual
cues relating to a preson's
appearance, color or stature is
found a new type of perception.
The visual perception becomes
unimportant since, as John says, it
is not perception that is importanl
but rather what we attach to
perception."
Talking to blind students one
realizes their life is not a constant
struggle against blindness but
rather a constant struggle with the
every day problems of students in
general. Their lives are a constant
stream of people, places,
emotions, sunny days, long
assignments, love and frustration,
only they have an added
frustration when people react to
them as a stereotype rather than
relating to them as people.
