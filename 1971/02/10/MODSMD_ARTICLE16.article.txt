# OSU Grapplers Wrestle Indians
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's varsity wrestlers
return to mat action tonight
against a highly-touted Oregon
State squad at 7:30 in the Old
Pavilion. The Beavers boast two
third place finishes in a row in the
NCAA Championships.
The highlight match of the
evening will pit 142-pound
co-captain Dave Thomas of
Stanford against Roger Weigel
who was third in last year's NCAA
Tourney. Incidentally Dale
Thomas, Dave's father, happens to
coach the Oregon State grapplers.
Stanford Coach Dave Reed
puts his team's 2-3 season mark
on the line tonight. Last weekend,
the Indians split two decisions by
outpointing UC Santa Barbara
2 4-18 at home after falling to
Fresno State College 27-12 on the
road.
Against Fresno, 134-pound
Ken Krebs recovered from a 9-1
deficit to pin his opponent at
6:03. In the 150-pound class,
Chris Horpel built up a 17-0 lead

before putting his Fresno
competitor out of misery with a
6:50 fall.
Although the match was tied at
12-12 after Horpel's pin, the
Cards were unable to overpower
the Fresno team in the upper
weights. Coach Reed commended
Bob Schoultz for an excellent
effort even in a losing cause,
though.
Saturday night against the
Gauchos, the Redskins garnered
victory in the last match on a pin
by Stanford heavyweight Lee Fair
at 4:30. Krebs had opened the
meet with a 7-6 win in an
outstanding performance. After a
5-0 decision for Thomas, Horpel
increased his team-leading pin
total with a win by fall at 3 :00.
At 167, Schoultz wrestled the
best match of his collegiate career
at Stanford defeating a very tough
opponent 4-3, according to Coach
Reed. Heavyweight Fair regained
his winning form with his
match-winning pin. Fair now has
the best dual meet record for the
Cards with a 7-2 season record.
