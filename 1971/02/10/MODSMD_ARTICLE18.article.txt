# Varsity Prospects
## Height Sustains Frosh 
### TOM QUINN 
Though basketball fortunes
have been less than spectacular for
the Stanford varsity this season,
the freshman team is well on its
way to becoming the best in
Stanford's history.
The little Indians sport an 11 -1
record with six games left on their
slate, and despite the fact that
these last contests will be their
toughest, a 17 -1 record is not out
of the question.
Coach "Bub" Bowling and
many other coaches rate the
Stanford frosh as the best in the
area, a fact which their record
supports.
Bowling feels that the key to
success is "that the team has
played very aggressively and gone
to the boards well. We have had
scoring balance, in fact, we've had
about seven or eight different high
point men in the games. Of
course, our depth has been very
substantial."
When a coach has such an
impressive record, he can afford
to express moderate amounts of
displeasure about not being fully
satisfied. Bowling is disappointed
that the team has not dominated
its opponents much more than it
has.
"The team doesn't break well
and doesn't play the defense
they're capable of. They haven't
even begun to reach their
potential.
"There is some doubt and

uncertainty as to the patterns.
The team is more confident and at
times has executed extremely
well. But we haven't worked
enough in practice and we don't
have enough experience to always
adapt our game to the opponents'
style."
Varsity Hopes
In answer to the most asked
question, Bowling expresses
confidence that the freshman will
really help the varsity next year.
They will bring with them
optimism and a winning spirit, but
the sheer physical lift they will
provide with their size is the
important factor.
The four big men, Steve Shupe
(6-6), Mike Mann (6-9), Jim
Helbush (6-7), and Dan Broderick
(6-6), have the best chance to help
the varisty immediately next year.
Coach Howie Dallmar sees "great
potential for these big men.
They should make an
immediate contribution, and with
a healthy Bob Buell and Pat
Stevens, there should be a lot of
competition in the Front line."
Mann To Help
Mann is seen as the key to the
offense because of the problem he
presents for the other team in
guarding him. His quickness and
jumping ability give him a high
offensive potential as well as
strong offensive prowess.
Shupe is the most aggressive of
the four and the statistics bear
this out, because he is close

behind the taller Mann in
rebounding figures. Helbush is
probably the most polished and
steadiest performer. He is the
second leading scorer, averaging
14 .4 points a game behind Mann's
16.5 and he usually draws the
toughest opponent on defense.
Broderick sees considerable action
as the fourth front-liner.
Dallmar is impressed by the
winning attitude of the forsh and
is especially encouraged by their
record, since the only blemish is a
one point loss on the road which
must fall in the upset category. He
knows the Indians undoubtedly
have the strongest frosh in the
area, yet he also knows that
UCLA and Oregon State have
outstanding teams.
Budget and scheduling
difficulties prevent Stanford from
playing these teams on the
freshman level, but this holds true
for every school. There is no way
to tell how Stanford rates with
other Pac-8 freshmen teams.
However, Dallmar knows that at
the very least, the inclusion of
some size into the lineup in the
future will remove the frustration
of being consistently outmatched
across the front line.

supports.
Bowling feels that the key to
success is "that the team has
played very aggressively and gone
to the boards well. We have had
scoring balance, in fact, we've had
about seven or eight different high
point men in the games. Of
course, our depth has been very
substantial."
When a coach has such an
impressive record, he can afford
to express moderate amounts of
displeasure about not being fully
satisfied. Bowling is disappointed
that the team has not dominated
its opponents much more than it
has.
"The team doesn't break well
and doesn't play the defense
they're capable of. They haven't
even begun to reach their
potential.
"There is some doubt and

uncertainty as to the patterns.
The team is more confident and at
times has executed extremely
well. But we haven't worked
enough in practice and we don't
have enough experience to always
adapt our game to the opponents'
style."
Varsity Hopes
In answer to the most asked
question, Bowling expresses
confidence that the freshman will
really help the varsity next year.
They will bring with them
optimism and a winning spirit, but
the sheer physical lift they will
provide with their size is the
important factor.
The four big men, Steve Shupe
(6-6), Mike Mann (6-9), Jim
Helbush (6-7), and Dan Broderick
(6-6), have the best chance to help
the varisty immediately next year.
Coach Howie Dallmar sees "great
potential for these big men.
They should make an
immediate contribution, and with
a healthy Bob Buell and Pat
Stevens, there should be a lot of
competition in the Front line."
Mann To Help
Mann is seen as the key to the
offense because of the problem he
presents for the other team in
guarding him. His quickness and
jumping ability give him a high
offensive potential as well as
strong offensive prowess.
Shupe is the most aggressive of
the four and the statistics bear
this out, because he is close

behind the taller Mann in
rebounding figures. Helbush is
probably the most polished and
steadiest performer. He is the
second leading scorer, averaging
14 .4 points a game behind Mann's
16.5 and he usually draws the
toughest opponent on defense.
Broderick sees considerable action
as the fourth front-liner.
Dallmar is impressed by the
winning attitude of the forsh and
is especially encouraged by their
record, since the only blemish is a
one point loss on the road which
must fall in the upset category. He
knows the Indians undoubtedly
have the strongest frosh in the
area, yet he also knows that
UCLA and Oregon State have
outstanding teams.
Budget and scheduling
difficulties prevent Stanford from
playing these teams on the
freshman level, but this holds true
for every school. There is no way
to tell how Stanford rates with
other Pac-8 freshmen teams.
However, Dallmar knows that at
the very least, the inclusion of
some size into the lineup in the
future will remove the frustration
of being consistently outmatched
across the front line.

Though basketball fortunes
have been less than spectacular for
the Stanford varsity this season,
the freshman team is well on its
way to becoming the best in
Stanford's history.
The little Indians sport an 11 -1
record with six games left on their

these last contests will be their
toughest, a 17 -1 record is not out
of the question.
