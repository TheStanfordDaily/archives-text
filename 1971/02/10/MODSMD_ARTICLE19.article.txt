Trail Under Attack
SAIGON — South Vietnamese troops
and tanks pressed westward across
branches of the Ho Chi Minh trail in
southern Laos Tuesday behind enemy
forces retreating under the furious lash
of U.S. air power.
At last reports, the main column in
the second day of the operation had
proceeded about 12 miles inside Laos
along Highway 9, slowed by U.S. bomb
craters in the road and bad weather
that suddenly closed in.
They also were halting to seize
munitions caches. Helicopter-borne
troops set up a fire base 15 miles west
of the Vietnamese border.
Operating in front of the South
Vietnamese, U.S. helicopter Cobras
attacked enemy supply depots 15 miles
inside Laos. Frontier reports said the
Cobras hit at least one oil dump and an
ammunition storage area, causing large
fires and some explosions.
Field dispatches said the South
Vietnamese had set up two artillery fire
bases inside Laos, one of them 15 miles
west of the border.
These reports said U.S. cargo
helicopters air-lifted five
105 mm howitzers and half a dozen
mortars along with ammunition and
other supplies for the new fire bases.
South Vietnamese officers said their
intelligence reports indicated that the
North Vietnamese troops in the
operation area are mostly young and
untrained and that the main force
veterans were deployed in Cambodia.
A South Vietnamese field
commander said he expected his troops
to push on westward along Highway 9
during the next 10 days toward
Savannakhet, on the western border of
Laos, thus snipping off all the branches
of roads that form the Ho Chi Minh
trail.
North Vietnamese launched a sharp
attack against a U.S. position
northwest of Lang Vei and less than a
mile from the Laotian border. About
9,000 U.S. troops are acting as a
blocking force for the 20,000 South
Vietnamese troops entering Laos.
The South Vietnamese in Laos were
moving under a U.S. air umbrella. U.S.
tactical combat planes had been flying
300-400 missions daily against the Ho

Chi Minh trail and other targets in
Laos.
Military spokesman said this action
had been stepped up 20 per cent since
the South Vietnamese incursion.
Apollo Home
ABOARD USS NEW ORLEANS -
Apollo 14 astronauts splashed down
safely on target in the South Pacific
and were brought aboard this carrier
Tuesday after completing man's most
successful moon mission.
Scientists, space officials and the
nation's President hailed the mission.
Astronauts Alan B. Shepard Jr.,
Stuart A. Roosa and Edgar D. Mitchell
dropped into the Pacific at 4:05 p.m.
EST, ending a nine-day, 1.15 million
mile voyage to the moon and back.
George Low, acting administrator of
the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, said, can only give
this mission an absolutely perfect score.
"We saw and heard two highly
skilled explorers seeking the top of
Cone Crater, collecting samples, setting
up experiments and taking
photographs.
Draft Call
WASHINGTON - The Pentagon called
yesterday for the draft of 17,000
young men into the Army in March.
This was the third straight month
the draft call has totaled 17,000 men.
Secretary of Defense Melvin R.
Laird has predicted that the 1971 draft
total will fall below last year's 16 3,5 0 0
young men.
So far this year, the total draft call
of 51,000 is slightly ahead of the
50,000 draft quota in the first three
months of 1970.
Irish Strife
BELFAST — A land mine, apparently
intended for the British army, killed
five civilian men Tuesday and Northern
Ireland's civil strife raged on with
Protestants and Roman Catholics
battling at two funerals.

The death of two technicians for the
British Broadcasting Corp. and three
construction workers in a vehicle on a
mountain road raised the death toll to
11 in less than a week.
In Belfast, fueding Catholic and
Protestant militants fought over the
coffins of republican dead.
An Irish republic flag was ripped off
the coffin of one Catholic victim of
street battles and Protestant mobs
hurled stones and bottles at another
cortege. They waved Union Jacks and
sang as they bombarded the funeral
procession.
