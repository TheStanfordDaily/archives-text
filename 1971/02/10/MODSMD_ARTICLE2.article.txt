# BSU Presses Ten Charges
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Ten charges, on issues ranging from
Univesity support of the Willow
Expressway to the support of "racist
white regimes in Africa," were leveled
at the administration by the Stanford
Black Students Union yesterday.
Following an hour-long rally in
White Plaza, attended by some 400
people, BSU Co-chairman Willie
Newberry presented the charges to
Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig
in lieu of President Lyman, who was
meeting with the Board of Trustees in
San Francisco.
The charges were first made public
in the latest edition of the Real News,
a paper published by Black students
here, and were later aired at several
rallies yesterday.
Newberry told Rosenzweig that
Lyman must answer the charges in an
open meeting with the BSU and the
Stanford community within a week.
There was no official reaction from
the administration. Rosenzweig said
last night that he did not expect any
immediately forthcoming.
A Student Senate investigating
committe, purportedly to be headed by
former BSU chairman Leo Bazile, may
also look into the charges and speak
with Lyman.
Charges Prefaced
As printed in the Real News, the
charges were prefaced with some
explanation: "Stanford University has
made every effort in the past months to
convince people within this University
and people outside it that it has a
serious commitment to Black students
and people of color.
"We are not of that impression. . .
Black students have concluded that
Stanford University is less than
committed to addressing the more
pressing problems facing people of
color."
The charges are the following:
"1) Stanford's participation and
support of the Willow Expressway plan
which will destroy over 433 units of
housing in Belle Haven, a Black
community already short of housing.
"2) Stanford's participation in the
destruction of Ravenswood High
School through its assistance in the
formulation of the Sequoia
desegregation plan.
"3) Stanford University's support of
racist white regimes in Africa through
research, investments, deposits, and
employment.

"4) More Stanford resources being
for racist and oppressive activity as
opposed to programs to liberate people
of color.
Financial Aid Cutbacks
"5) Increasing cutbacks in financial
aids to people of color; cutbacks in
work-study, scholarships for entering
and transfer students.
"6) 22 per cent of the death rate in
Viet Nam (and all the other places your
wars are fought against people of color)
are Blacks, while Stanford's enrollment
of Blacks is less than 4 per cent.
"7) No Black instructors in several
departments and programs, including
Political Science, Economics, Music,
and Art.
"8) Extremely limited resources
available to support academic programs
for Black students, including Black
studies, counseling, and tutoring.
"9) A gross lack of Black
administrators with decision-making
authority.
"10) Stanford University employs
only a very small number of people of
color as it is; and those few that are
employed are and have been subjected
to arbitrary treatment at the hands of
those who hire and fire."
University Role
Most prominent among the charges,
all aired at the rally, was that of the
University role in support of the Willow
Expressway, and the relocation
problems that will ensue.
One speaker, Doug McHenry,
declared that the State Department of
Highways has only once effected
substantial relocation for people
displaced by its projects. And that was
in Watts—and it failed!" noted
McHenry.
"The Highway Department can't
relocate people it will displace in this
same area," explained McHenry,
"because there simply is no available
housing. They are using concrete as a
defoliant—and the University is
shamming by supporting Willow
Expressway!"
As noted in the January 8 Daily,
University support of the Willow
Expressway may be coupled with the
recommendation that the highway
department finance construction of
housing to replace units which will be
destroyed.
According to Manager of Real
Estate, Boyd Smith, "If there is still a
low-moderate income housing shortage
when they begin acquiring the

right-of-way, then my recommendation
will be that the University reqommend
that the state build replacement
housing."
President Lyman, when asked if he
would support the expressway if
replacement housing was not provided,
replied, "I'd be very critical of that
aspect of it."
In October, a University statement
declared, "We understand that every
person whose residence will be required
for the Expressway must be relocated
to his reasonable satisfaction before
construction can commence."

White Plaza, attended by some 400
people, BSU Co-chairman Willie
Newberry presented the charges to
Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig
in lieu of President Lyman, who was
meeting with the Board of Trustees in
San Francisco.
The charges were first made public
in the latest edition of the Real News,
a paper published by Black students
here, and were later aired at several
rallies yesterday.
Newberry told Rosenzweig that
Lyman must answer the charges in an
open meeting with the BSU and the
Stanford community within a week.
There was no official reaction from
the administration. Rosenzweig said
last night that he did not expect any
immediately forthcoming.
A Student Senate investigating
committe, purportedly to be headed by
former BSU chairman Leo Bazile, may
also look into the charges and speak
with Lyman.
Charges Prefaced
As printed in the Real News, the
charges were prefaced with some
explanation: "Stanford University has
made every effort in the past months to
convince people within this University
and people outside it that it has a
serious commitment to Black students
and people of color.
"We are not of that impression. . .
Black students have concluded that
Stanford University is less than
committed to addressing the more
pressing problems facing people of
color."
The charges are the following:
"1) Stanford's participation and
support of the Willow Expressway plan
which will destroy over 433 units of
housing in Belle Haven, a Black
community already short of housing.
"2) Stanford's participation in the
destruction of Ravenswood High
School through its assistance in the
formulation of the Sequoia
desegregation plan.
"3) Stanford University's support of
racist white regimes in Africa through
research, investments, deposits, and
employment.

"4) More Stanford resources being
for racist and oppressive activity as
opposed to programs to liberate people
of color.
Financial Aid Cutbacks
"5) Increasing cutbacks in financial
aids to people of color; cutbacks in
work-study, scholarships for entering
and transfer students.
"6) 22 per cent of the death rate in
Viet Nam (and all the other places your
wars are fought against people of color)
are Blacks, while Stanford's enrollment
of Blacks is less than 4 per cent.
"7) No Black instructors in several
departments and programs, including
Political Science, Economics, Music,
and Art.
"8) Extremely limited resources
available to support academic programs
for Black students, including Black
studies, counseling, and tutoring.
"9) A gross lack of Black
administrators with decision-making
authority.
"10) Stanford University employs
only a very small number of people of
color as it is; and those few that are
employed are and have been subjected
to arbitrary treatment at the hands of
those who hire and fire."
University Role
Most prominent among the charges,
all aired at the rally, was that of the
University role in support of the Willow
Expressway, and the relocation
problems that will ensue.
One speaker, Doug McHenry,
declared that the State Department of
Highways has only once effected
substantial relocation for people
displaced by its projects. And that was
in Watts—and it failed!" noted
McHenry.
"The Highway Department can't
relocate people it will displace in this
same area," explained McHenry,
"because there simply is no available
housing. They are using concrete as a
defoliant—and the University is
shamming by supporting Willow
Expressway!"
As noted in the January 8 Daily,
University support of the Willow
Expressway may be coupled with the
recommendation that the highway
department finance construction of
housing to replace units which will be
destroyed.
According to Manager of Real
Estate, Boyd Smith, "If there is still a
low-moderate income housing shortage
when they begin acquiring the

right-of-way, then my recommendation
will be that the University reqommend
that the state build replacement
housing."
President Lyman, when asked if he
would support the expressway if
replacement housing was not provided,
replied, "I'd be very critical of that
aspect of it."
In October, a University statement
declared, "We understand that every
person whose residence will be required
for the Expressway must be relocated
to his reasonable satisfaction before
construction can commence."
Ten charges, on issues ranging from
Univesity support of the Willow
Expressway to the support of "racist
white regimes in Africa," were leveled
at the administration by the Stanford
Black Students Union yesterday.
