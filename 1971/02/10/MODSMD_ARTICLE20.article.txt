the Senate termed "Declaration of
Inter-Dependence" stated, "Whereas
the role of Stanford University with
respect to society and the role of the
University with respect to its members
are inextricably linked;

Whereas, the myth of the unified
community of scholars engaged in the
neutral pursuit of Truth veils the
domestic and International
consequences of the role of the
University in economic, political,
social, and ideological conflict;
Whereas, there is no law at Stanford
University, in the sense of any
meaningful restraint on the arbitrary
exercise of authority by the President
to discipline students;
Whereas, such unlimited authority is
the hallmark of tyranny and an
essential requirement of a police state,
however enlightened or benevolent its
use;
Therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate of the Associated Students of
Stanford University that;
A. The ASSU Senate hereby places
itself on record as repudiating the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968;
B. No regulations concerning
student conduct be promulgated or
enforced, except with the concurrence
of legislative bodies or judicial panels
composed only of students, or of both
students and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect to the
promulgation or enforcement of
regulations concerning faculty conduct;
C. With respect to the enforcement
of whatever regulations be enacted in

accordance with paragraph (B) above,
no proceedings be undertaken which
contravene in any way the guarantees
of individual rights contained in the
Constitutions of the United States and
the State of California;
D. Unless and until the Board of
Trustees, or the President acting on
their behalf, agrees to the fundamental
procedural and substantive guarantees
contained in the paragraphs (B) and (C)
above, the ASSU Senate hereby places
itself on record as opposing any
academic penalties for non-academic
conduct at Stanford University, and
notes that defendants charged with
non-academic conduct would have at
least their due process rights protected
if such conduct were handled in the
civil and criminal courts of California
or the United States."
In other business, the Senate passed

students and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect to the
promulgation or enforcement of
regulations concerning faculty conduct;
C. With respect to the enforcement
of whatever regulations be enacted in

accordance with paragraph (B) above,
no proceedings be undertaken which
contravene in any way the guarantees
of individual rights contained in the
Constitutions of the United States and
the State of California;
D. Unless and until the Board of
Trustees, or the President acting on
their behalf, agrees to the fundamental
procedural and substantive guarantees
contained in the paragraphs (B) and (C)
above, the ASSU Senate hereby places
itself on record as opposing any
academic penalties for non-academic
conduct at Stanford University, and
notes that defendants charged with
non-academic conduct would have at
least their due process rights protected
if such conduct were handled in the
civil and criminal courts of California
or the United States."
In other business, the Senate passed
a resolution recognizing the
Asian-Americans as a minority group
"with distinct problems and needs" and
requested that the University
Committee on Minority Affairs
investigate the status of
Asian-Americans in light of their
problems and needs.
The Senate also gave all Senate
standing and special committees
subpoena power, with the right to
vacate subpoenas reserved to the rules
committee or, upon recommendation
of the rules committee, the Senate.
Calling for the end of "academic
penalties" for "non-academic
conduct," the Student Senate,
yesterday, repudiated the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 1968 and
proposed that the issue be placed
before the students in the next general
election.
Passed on a roll call vote of 22 to 7 ,
the Senate termed "Declaration of
Inter-Dependence" stated, "Whereas
the role of Stanford University with
respect to society and the role of the
University with respect to its members
are inextricably linked;

Whereas, the myth of the unified
community of scholars engaged in the
neutral pursuit of Truth veils the
domestic and International
consequences of the role of the
University in economic, political,
social, and ideological conflict;
Whereas, there is no law at Stanford
University, in the sense of any
meaningful restraint on the arbitrary
exercise of authority by the President
to discipline students;
Whereas, such unlimited authority is
the hallmark of tyranny and an
essential requirement of a police state,
however enlightened or benevolent its
use;
Therefore, be it resolved by the
Senate of the Associated Students of
Stanford University that;
A. The ASSU Senate hereby places
itself on record as repudiating the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968;
B. No regulations concerning
student conduct be promulgated or
enforced, except with the concurrence
of legislative bodies or judicial panels
composed only of students, or of both
students and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect to the
promulgation or enforcement of
regulations concerning faculty conduct;
C. With respect to the enforcement
of whatever regulations be enacted in

accordance with paragraph (B) above,
no proceedings be undertaken which
contravene in any way the guarantees
of individual rights contained in the
Constitutions of the United States and
the State of California;
