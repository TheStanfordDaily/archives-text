# Lodge Defendants Walk Out; Disruption Of Speech Found
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON FRED MANN 
The Defense Collective walked out
of its Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
hearing on the Lodge case yesterday
saying that there was "no point in
continuing this farcical trial."
In a statement to the SJC one hour
and 45 minutes into the hearing in
physics 101, defendant Janet Weiss said
that it was necessary to place the
hearing in its proper perspective," and
that in view of the more important
BSU demands (See related story) and
Laos invasion, "it is not correct for a
movement to be focusing on us."
Asking that the University be shut
down until the U.S. was out of Laos
and Southeast Asia, Weiss, the rest of
the Defense Collective and their
supporters left the hearing chanting,
"NLF, Pathet Lao, U.S. out of Asia
now."
Upon leaving the hearing, the
defendants went to the nearby physics
100 where 300 students were watching
a video broadcast of the hearing.
Disruption Found
The SJC continued to convene for
two and a half hours following the
walkout and announced after a recess
of the hearing that it had found "that
there was a disruption within the
meaning of the University policy on
campus disruption at the time of the
scheduled speech of Henry Cabot
Lodge on Jan. 11."

In the first hour and fifteen.minutes
of the hearing, heavily guarded by
Santa Clara deputies and Stanford
police, the defense introduced a
multitude of motions, among them: to
remove all security from the building,
to move to a larger room, to dismiss all
charges against the defendants, to
reinstate the four students suspended
for contempt at the Jan. 29 hearing, to
delay the hearing until the BSU had
presented its demands to Lyman, and
to change the time of the hearing to
evenings.
The SJC then recessed for thirty
minutes and upon reconvening,
announced its rulings on the motions,
denying the majority. The rulings were
greeted by boos and hisses from the 75
in the gallery.
Innocent Until Proven?
It was at this point that Wei.
addressed the hearing. Charging that
the SJC "has already decided the
verdict," she stated that the place of
the defendants was "out in the
community."
She then pleaded Nolo contendere, a
plea by which the defendant does not
contest the charges and neither admits
guilt nor claims innocence.
Finally calling for a student strike in
view of Laos and the BSU demands, she
left the meeting followed by the rest of
the Defense Collective and its
supporters.
John Schwartz, assistant to the
Provost, proceeded with the
prosecution following the walkout,

which had reduced the spectators in the
room from some 75 to 30.
As the defendants entered the
physics tank they were met with
applause, and led the T.V. watchers
gathered there in a cheer.
The group disconnected the TV sets,
still tuned to the nearly empty council
chamber, and began laying plans for a
student strike.
"This so-called trial was the
publicity focus for the movement
against the war here," said defendant
Weiss. "Now the strike must be."
In calling for support of the BSU
demands, H. Bruce FYanklin said, "No
black brothers or sisters are going to go
down without us."
One of the tentative plans for strike
demands was the lifting of the Santa
Clara County curfew against minors on
the street past 10 :00 p.m.
"I am warning all of you not to
associate with this guy," said Franklin.
"We have known for a long time
exactly who he is."
Dunkin, startled, emphatically
denied the charge, and many in the
audience asked Franklin to produce
evidence to support his charge.
"Those of you asking for
documentation are not those whose
lives are threatened by him," replied
Franklin. "I can't give you evidence
because I cannot expose our sources."
Some labeled the charge similar to
those of the Joe McCarthy days, but in
reverse. Others held Dunkin's protests

of the charge a plot to distract people
from the purpose of the meeting.
"If the man (Franklin) says he's an
informer, he probably is," said one
man. "This (the discussion of the
charge) is all a stage act to take your
minds off the real action."
"Serve The People"
"I had to do it to serve the people,"
said Franklin. "I have withheld this
knowledge for weeks. I knew it would
be an unpopular remark to make when
I said it."
The meeting broke up about 3:10
p.m. with plans for the Dinkelspiel
meeting that night.

The SJC meanwhile was hearing
Schwartz present two tapes of the
Lodge speech and three witnesses
testify that they had been unable to
hear Lodge speak due to heckling from
the audience. Schwartz summed up
the prosecution by asking.
"The question is this: Could the
speaker (Lodge) be heard?"
Following its decision that a
disruption had occurred at the Lodge
speech, the SJC announced that it had
not yet decided where or when it
would hold its next hearing to
determine if the seven defendants
participated in the disruption.

physics 101, defendant Janet Weiss said
that it was necessary to place the
hearing in its proper perspective," and
that in view of the more important
BSU demands (See related story) and
Laos invasion, "it is not correct for a
movement to be focusing on us."
Asking that the University be shut
down until the U.S. was out of Laos
and Southeast Asia, Weiss, the rest of
the Defense Collective and their
supporters left the hearing chanting,
"NLF, Pathet Lao, U.S. out of Asia
now."
Upon leaving the hearing, the
defendants went to the nearby physics
100 where 300 students were watching
a video broadcast of the hearing.
Disruption Found
The SJC continued to convene for
two and a half hours following the
walkout and announced after a recess
of the hearing that it had found "that
there was a disruption within the
meaning of the University policy on
campus disruption at the time of the
scheduled speech of Henry Cabot
Lodge on Jan. 11."

In the first hour and fifteen.minutes
of the hearing, heavily guarded by
Santa Clara deputies and Stanford
police, the defense introduced a
multitude of motions, among them: to
remove all security from the building,
to move to a larger room, to dismiss all
charges against the defendants, to
reinstate the four students suspended
for contempt at the Jan. 29 hearing, to
delay the hearing until the BSU had
presented its demands to Lyman, and
to change the time of the hearing to
evenings.
The SJC then recessed for thirty
minutes and upon reconvening,
announced its rulings on the motions,
denying the majority. The rulings were
greeted by boos and hisses from the 75
in the gallery.
Innocent Until Proven?

addressed the hearing. Charging that
the SJC "has already decided the
verdict," she stated that the place of
the defendants was "out in the
community."
She then pleaded Nolo contendere, a
plea by which the defendant does not
contest the charges and neither admits
guilt nor claims innocence.
Finally calling for a student strike in
view of Laos and the BSU demands, she
left the meeting followed by the rest of
the Defense Collective and its
supporters.
John Schwartz, assistant to the
Provost, proceeded with the
prosecution following the walkout,

which had reduced the spectators in the
room from some 75 to 30.
As the defendants entered the
physics tank they were met with
applause, and led the T.V. watchers
gathered there in a cheer.
The group disconnected the TV sets,
still tuned to the nearly empty council
chamber, and began laying plans for a
student strike.
"This so-called trial was the
publicity focus for the movement
against the war here," said defendant
Weiss. "Now the strike must be."
In calling for support of the BSU
demands, H. Bruce FYanklin said, "No
black brothers or sisters are going to go
down without us."
One of the tentative plans for strike
demands was the lifting of the Santa
Clara County curfew against minors on
the street past 10 :00 p.m.
"I am warning all of you not to
associate with this guy," said Franklin.
"We have known for a long time
exactly who he is."
Dunkin, startled, emphatically
denied the charge, and many in the
audience asked Franklin to produce
evidence to support his charge.
"Those of you asking for
documentation are not those whose
lives are threatened by him," replied
Franklin. "I can't give you evidence
because I cannot expose our sources."
Some labeled the charge similar to
those of the Joe McCarthy days, but in
reverse. Others held Dunkin's protests

from the purpose of the meeting.
"If the man (Franklin) says he's an
informer, he probably is," said one
man. "This (the discussion of the
charge) is all a stage act to take your
minds off the real action."
"Serve The People"
"I had to do it to serve the people,"
said Franklin. "I have withheld this
knowledge for weeks. I knew it would
be an unpopular remark to make when
I said it."
The meeting broke up about 3:10
p.m. with plans for the Dinkelspiel
meeting that night.

The SJC meanwhile was hearing
Schwartz present two tapes of the
Lodge speech and three witnesses
testify that they had been unable to
hear Lodge speak due to heckling from
the audience. Schwartz summed up
the prosecution by asking.
"The question is this: Could the
speaker (Lodge) be heard?"
Following its decision that a
disruption had occurred at the Lodge
speech, the SJC announced that it had
not yet decided where or when it
would hold its next hearing to
determine if the seven defendants
participated in the disruption.
The Defense Collective walked out
of its Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
hearing on the Lodge case yesterday

continuing this farcical trial."

Asking that the University be shut
down until the U.S. was out of Laos
and Southeast Asia, Weiss, the rest of
the Defense Collective and their
supporters left the hearing chanting,
"NLF, Pathet Lao, U.S. out of Asia
now."
Upon leaving the hearing, the
defendants went to the nearby physics
100 where 300 students were watching
a video broadcast of the hearing.
Disruption Found
The SJC continued to convene for
two and a half hours following the
walkout and announced after a recess
of the hearing that it had found "that
there was a disruption within the
meaning of the University policy on
campus disruption at the time of the
scheduled speech of Henry Cabot
Lodge on Jan. 11."

In the first hour and fifteen.minutes
of the hearing, heavily guarded by
Santa Clara deputies and Stanford
police, the defense introduced a
multitude of motions, among them: to
remove all security from the building,
to move to a larger room, to dismiss all
charges against the defendants, to
reinstate the four students suspended
for contempt at the Jan. 29 hearing, to
delay the hearing until the BSU had
presented its demands to Lyman, and
to change the time of the hearing to
evenings.
The SJC then recessed for thirty
minutes and upon reconvening,
announced its rulings on the motions,
denying the majority. The rulings were
greeted by boos and hisses from the 75
in the gallery.
Innocent Until Proven?
It was at this point that Wei.
addressed the hearing. Charging that
the SJC "has already decided the
verdict," she stated that the place of
the defendants was "out in the
community."
She then pleaded Nolo contendere, a
plea by which the defendant does not
contest the charges and neither admits
guilt nor claims innocence.
Finally calling for a student strike in
view of Laos and the BSU demands, she
left the meeting followed by the rest of
the Defense Collective and its
supporters.
John Schwartz, assistant to the
Provost, proceeded with the
prosecution following the walkout,

which had reduced the spectators in the
room from some 75 to 30.
As the defendants entered the
physics tank they were met with
applause, and led the T.V. watchers
gathered there in a cheer.
The group disconnected the TV sets,
still tuned to the nearly empty council
chamber, and began laying plans for a
student strike.
"This so-called trial was the
publicity focus for the movement
against the war here," said defendant
Weiss. "Now the strike must be."
In calling for support of the BSU
demands, H. Bruce FYanklin said, "No
black brothers or sisters are going to go
down without us."
One of the tentative plans for strike
demands was the lifting of the Santa
Clara County curfew against minors on
the street past 10 :00 p.m.
"I am warning all of you not to
associate with this guy," said Franklin.
"We have known for a long time
exactly who he is."
Dunkin, startled, emphatically
denied the charge, and many in the
audience asked Franklin to produce
evidence to support his charge.
"Those of you asking for
documentation are not those whose
lives are threatened by him," replied
Franklin. "I can't give you evidence
because I cannot expose our sources."
Some labeled the charge similar to
those of the Joe McCarthy days, but in
reverse. Others held Dunkin's protests

of the charge a plot to distract people
from the purpose of the meeting.
"If the man (Franklin) says he's an
informer, he probably is," said one
man. "This (the discussion of the
charge) is all a stage act to take your
minds off the real action."
"Serve The People"
"I had to do it to serve the people,"
said Franklin. "I have withheld this
knowledge for weeks. I knew it would
be an unpopular remark to make when
I said it."
The meeting broke up about 3:10
p.m. with plans for the Dinkelspiel
meeting that night.

The SJC meanwhile was hearing
Schwartz present two tapes of the
Lodge speech and three witnesses
testify that they had been unable to
hear Lodge speak due to heckling from
the audience. Schwartz summed up
the prosecution by asking.
"The question is this: Could the
speaker (Lodge) be heard?"
Following its decision that a
disruption had occurred at the Lodge
speech, the SJC announced that it had
not yet decided where or when it
would hold its next hearing to
determine if the seven defendants
participated in the disruption.
The Defense Collective walked out
of its Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
hearing on the Lodge case yesterday
saying that there was "no point in
continuing this farcical trial."
In a statement to the SJC one hour
and 45 minutes into the hearing in
physics 101, defendant Janet Weiss said
that it was necessary to place the
hearing in its proper perspective," and
that in view of the more important
BSU demands (See related story) and
Laos invasion, "it is not correct for a
movement to be focusing on us."
