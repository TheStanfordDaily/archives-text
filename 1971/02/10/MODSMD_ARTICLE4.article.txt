# Strong Quake Rocks Los Angeles
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP) - A powerful
earthquake staggered Southern
California yesterday, leaving at least 33
dead and trapping some 30 persons in
the rubble of a collapsed hospital. Their
fate was in doubt.
Eighty-thousand persons in a
20-square mile area near a
quake-weakened dam in San Fernando
Valley were ordered to evacuate the
area or be forcibly removed.
Authorities, in making the evacuation
"mandatory," said they feared a strong
new tremor might cause a flood.
Property damage was extensive as
walls collapsed, streets buckled and
caved in, bridges fell and windows
shattered in heavily populated areas
around Los Angeles, the nation's third
most populous city.
The sheriff's office estimated that
more than 850 persons were injured in
the quake area.
Disaster Area
In Washington, President Nixon
issued a formal declaration of a major
disaster, opening the way for help from
more than a dozen government
agencies. Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew was due in the quake area today
for consultations.
Nine of the deaths were attributed
to heart attacks.
Heaviest loss of, life was at the
Veterans' Administration Hospital at
Sylmar in the west end of the San
Fernando Valley, some 1 0 miles from
the quake's center.
There I 7 bodies were found, and
about I 00 persons were injured. Ten
hours after the first shock, an estimated
30 persons, mostly patients, wen
reported still trapped.

Seismologists placed the quake's
center 26 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles and blamed the
San Gabriel fault, a boomerang-shaped
crack in the earth.
The jolting first shock, followed by
literally hundreds of smaller
aftershocks, struck hardest at the Los
Angeles commuting area in the San
Fernando Valley, with a population of
1.3 million. Also seriously hit were the
towns of Newhall and Saugus, with an
area population of 70,000, also within
10 miles of the center.

The earth-fill dam of Van Norman
Lake at the valley's west end suffered
vertical cracks and some leaking of its
6.7 billion gallons of water, the city's
largest store. Hundreds of families were
evacuated and officials began draining
the lake.
Early Morning Quake
The county's nearly seven million
residents were asleep or preparing for
the day when the shock came—sudden
shakes for those close, a strong rolling
motion for those more distant.
Indescribable confusion ensued.

Residents awoke to find their beds
tossing like ships at sea. Windows
shattered, furniture flipped over,
chimneys crumbled, pictures on walls
and dishes on shelves crashed, roads
were torn and crumpled, bridges
collapsed. On some old structures,
roofs fell in and walls fell outward.
Major freeways were blocked.
Scores of fires broke out as gas
mains ruptured. A few streets were
flooded due to water main breaks.
Power was knocked out in many areas,
along with telephone service.
The Division of Highways tallied at
least $5 million in damage to major
routes, saying the Golden State
Freeway near Newhall buckled, with
slabs tiited as much as five feet above
the roadbed. Major damage was
reported to seven freeway structures.
Five major highways were closed:
The Golden State Freeway Interstate 5;
The San Diego Freeway Interstate 405
near San Fernando due to a bridge
collapse, Interstate 210 near Newhall;
California 14 near Newhall; and
California 2 near La Canada.

his prediction came true so soon in

"great" earthquake would hit
California in this century.

added. "This was a big earthquake but
not a great one."

fate was in doubt.
Eighty-thousand persons in a
20-square mile area near a
quake-weakened dam in San Fernando
Valley were ordered to evacuate the
area or be forcibly removed.
Authorities, in making the evacuation
"mandatory," said they feared a strong
new tremor might cause a flood.
Property damage was extensive as
walls collapsed, streets buckled and
caved in, bridges fell and windows
shattered in heavily populated areas
around Los Angeles, the nation's third
most populous city.
The sheriff's office estimated that
more than 850 persons were injured in
the quake area.
Disaster Area
In Washington, President Nixon
issued a formal declaration of a major
disaster, opening the way for help from
more than a dozen government
agencies. Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew was due in the quake area today
for consultations.
Nine of the deaths were attributed
to heart attacks.
Heaviest loss of, life was at the
Veterans' Administration Hospital at
Sylmar in the west end of the San
Fernando Valley, some 1 0 miles from
the quake's center.
There I 7 bodies were found, and
about I 00 persons were injured. Ten
hours after the first shock, an estimated
30 persons, mostly patients, wen
reported still trapped.

Seismologists placed the quake's
center 26 miles northwest of
downtown Los Angeles and blamed the
San Gabriel fault, a boomerang-shaped
crack in the earth.
The jolting first shock, followed by
literally hundreds of smaller
aftershocks, struck hardest at the Los
Angeles commuting area in the San
Fernando Valley, with a population of
1.3 million. Also seriously hit were the
towns of Newhall and Saugus, with an
area population of 70,000, also within
10 miles of the center.

The earth-fill dam of Van Norman
Lake at the valley's west end suffered
vertical cracks and some leaking of its
6.7 billion gallons of water, the city's
largest store. Hundreds of families were
evacuated and officials began draining
the lake.
Early Morning Quake
The county's nearly seven million
residents were asleep or preparing for
the day when the shock came—sudden
shakes for those close, a strong rolling
motion for those more distant.
Indescribable confusion ensued.

Residents awoke to find their beds
tossing like ships at sea. Windows
shattered, furniture flipped over,
chimneys crumbled, pictures on walls
and dishes on shelves crashed, roads
were torn and crumpled, bridges
collapsed. On some old structures,
roofs fell in and walls fell outward.
Major freeways were blocked.
Scores of fires broke out as gas
mains ruptured. A few streets were
flooded due to water main breaks.
Power was knocked out in many areas,
along with telephone service.
The Division of Highways tallied at
least $5 million in damage to major
routes, saying the Golden State
Freeway near Newhall buckled, with
slabs tiited as much as five feet above
the roadbed. Major damage was
reported to seven freeway structures.
Five major highways were closed:
The Golden State Freeway Interstate 5;
The San Diego Freeway Interstate 405
near San Fernando due to a bridge
collapse, Interstate 210 near Newhall;
California 14 near Newhall; and
California 2 near La Canada.
