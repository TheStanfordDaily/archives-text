Telephone bells were ringing early this morning in the homes of geophysicists
throughout the Bay Area as the word of the Los Angeles earthquake spread. At
the U.S. Geological Survey Seismology Office, 300 Menlo Avenue in Menlo Park,
this was a day marked as much by seismologist activity as seismic activity. By four
in the afternoon nearly every geophysicist connected with the laboratory had
boarded a plane for Los Angeles.
The Menlo Park facility is responsible for monitoring seismic activity
throughout California's central valley, and as far south as Santa Barbara. A
network of dozens of monitoring stations continuously transmits information
about seismic disturbances to the laboratory, where the data is processed on a
daily basis.
Information Source
As tragic as the earthquake may be in terms of loss of life and destruction of
property, the fact remains that it is a most vital source of information for
seismologists. Geological Survey scientists expect to find valuable clues as to the
nature of earthquakes by examining seismic activity in the region of the epicenter.
With deeper understanding of the earthqi ake process comes the potential for
forecasting future shocks.
Ideallv scientists would like to study earthquakes by ovserving closehand the
