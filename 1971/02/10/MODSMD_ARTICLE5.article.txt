# Quake Research Ongoing

Telephone bells were ringing early this morning in the homes of geophysicists
throughout the Bay Area as the word of the Los Angeles earthquake spread. At
the U.S. Geological Survey Seismology Office, 300 Menlo Avenue in Menlo Park,
this was a day marked as much by seismologist activity as seismic activity. By four
in the afternoon nearly every geophysicist connected with the laboratory had
boarded a plane for Los Angeles.
The Menlo Park facility is responsible for monitoring seismic activity
throughout California's central valley, and as far south as Santa Barbara. A
network of dozens of monitoring stations continuously transmits information
about seismic disturbances to the laboratory, where the data is processed on a
daily basis.
Information Source
As tragic as the earthquake may be in terms of loss of life and destruction of
property, the fact remains that it is a most vital source of information for
seismologists. Geological Survey scientists expect to find valuable clues as to the
nature of earthquakes by examining seismic activity in the region of the epicenter.
With deeper understanding of the earthqi ake process comes the potential for
forecasting future shocks.
Ideallv scientists would like to study earthquakes by ovserving closehand the
earthquake itself. Most physical phenomena can be studied either by bringing the
phenomenon into a laboratory and surrounding it with measuring instruments, or
by bringing the measuring instruments to where the phenomenon is expected to
occur, and then waiting for it to happen.
Since nobody knows how to predict, with any reasonable accuracy, either the
time or the place that an earthquake will occur, earthquakes must be studied by
first noticing that a quake has occurred, and then setting up the instruments
necessary to record detailed seismic activity in the area of the quake. Scientists are
now doing just that, and it is expected that this large tremor will prove to be a
gold mine of scientific information.
Building Codes
Of particular interest to residents of the Bay Area, and of San Francisco in
particular, will be studies by structural engineers of the damage done by the
tremor to buildings in Los Angeles. Building codes have been designed to
guarantee that homes and office buildings in areas of high seismic activity will be
"earthquake-proof." Most of these building code features have never been tested
in a real earthquake. It has been estimated that the amount of data available to
structural engineers increased by a factor of one hundred in the period from 6 :00
a.m. to 6 :0 2 a.m., PST, 9 February 1971.
Earth's Crust
Possibly of less immediate impact is what geologists hope to learn about the
behavior of the earth's crust in the vicinity of the earthquake. It is well known
that different kinds of rocks and soil will behave in drastically different ways
under stress. However, as in the case of the structural engineers, geologists have
had relatively few opportunities to test laboratory-derived theories in an actual
earthquake. The geology of the Los Angeles area is well know, and the "before
and after" picture now available should be of great interest to scientists.
It is, of course, a moral outrage to describe a disaster such as the Los Angeles
earthquake as being anything less than a disaster. However, it is perhaps a bit
comforting to know that out of the ruins may come the knowledge that will make
it possible to reduce suffering in the future.
We will never be able to avoid earthquakes; but someday we may learn how to
live with them.
