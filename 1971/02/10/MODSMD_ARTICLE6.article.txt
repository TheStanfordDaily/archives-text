## Toward A Successful Strike 
### 
Alan hyde

Nearly everyone at the White
Pla/.a rally Monday (except
freshmen) must have felt a sense
of deja vu. We have been through
strikes before, and perhaps that is
why, objectively, so much of the
manpower for previous strikes has
come from each year's freshman
class. Hopefully by now, though,
all our social practice has helped
us to formulate some correct ideas
about successful strikes.
It is not hard to see where last
spring's Cambodia strike went
awry, for it is a problem that has
plagued almost every radical
movement in American
history—expansion so that new
members, more moderate to begin
with, will be content with more
moderate, reformist goals. That is
how the early feminists became a
movement for suffrage alone.
That is how black liberation
stopped demanding equality and
began to coalesce around Booker
T. Washington. That is how last
spring's strike moved from a strike

against the University to a bizarre
pluralism of dozens of competing
ineffectual protests which soon
became little more than an
amorphous accumulation of
"concern."
Two Truisms
What happens next is also easy
to see. Surely everyone
remembers the nagging feeling
that, since nothing is going on,
one might as well be in class.
Incredible efforts by radicals are
then required to keep students
from going to class—exhortation,
arousal of guilt, etc. The simple
truth is that IF SOMETHING
VALUABLE IS GOING ON,
STUDENTS WILL CUT CLASS
VOLUNTARILY (the corollary of
course being that if nothing is
going on they will not cut class at
all). The second truism is that,
even if a tremendous mass
movement does not emerge at
first, FIVE HUNDRED
STUDENTS DOING
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE IS
FAR BETTER THAN TWO
THOUSAND STUDENTS AT
THE BEACH.
This does not mean that
individual or small group projects
(from writing Senator McGovern
to trashing) should be
condemned, which would be a
waste of time anyway, but that
one strong ongoing effort exist
which will be attractive enough to
discourage adventurism or
pluralism. Such attraction will
depend on the effort having goals
which are both attainable and

significant, both of which require
their clear definition. People do
not sacrifice, students do not even
strike, over abstractions.
Two such suggestions follow.
Each will probably appeal to a
different philosophy and they
thus suggest the range, not the
limits, of discussion.
The first is a protracted effort
at education and organization in
the industrial park. The park
symbolizes everything wrong with
Stanford, as it shows how the
university's land policies, faculty
time, and philosophy of education
are geared to promotion of
American industrial expansion,
particularly overseas. Yet our
attention to it is generally limited
to a yearly march. An attempt to
set up educational centers at each
firm, to talk to employees, and
perhaps some large
demonstrations against firms will
require sustained effort yet should
be able to include all those who
wish to extend vocal protest to
America's Indochina campaign
beyond the elite campuses.
Victory to Victory
The other suggestion involves
concrete on-campus demands for
close monitoring and gradual
abolition of war research here and
at the Stanford Research
Institute. This is attractive
because of the work that has
recently been done implicating
(for example) the Computer
Center in direct strategic planning.
It is also attractive because it
involves a result that is attainable

through pressure on the faculty.
As anyone knows, a movement
gains strength and credibility
through moving from victory to
victory. If all the people who last
year were scattered around Encina
Hall or exhorting the dormitories
could unite for one effort on (say)
the Computer Center, a goal—any
important goal that will add
credibility to the Movement as an
effective force—will be much
closer than it would be if each
affinity group chooses its favorite
laboratory.
The man in White Plaza who
said that we ought to move off
the University and out into the
people where the power lies was
surely mistaken. If history teaches
anything at all it is that as
individuals we are absolutely
powerless to influence public
policy, • let alone specifically
foreign policy. If the Movement
as a whole engages in valuable and
potentially productive activity, it
will have organized and expanded
itself. Above all, we must
remember that one cannot ask
people to abandon their present
lives unless you have something
real to offer them. Apparently,
Stanford radicalism has not done
so on a sustained basis, but,
united as we are now against our
government, we can decide to
offer that something real to our
fellow students and to the
community outside.

involves a result that is attainable

through pressure on the faculty.
As anyone knows, a movement
gains strength and credibility
through moving from victory to
victory. If all the people who last
year were scattered around Encina
Hall or exhorting the dormitories
could unite for one effort on (say)
the Computer Center, a goal—any
important goal that will add
credibility to the Movement as an
effective force—will be much
closer than it would be if each
affinity group chooses its favorite
laboratory.
The man in White Plaza who
said that we ought to move off
the University and out into the
people where the power lies was
surely mistaken. If history teaches
anything at all it is that as
individuals we are absolutely
powerless to influence public
policy, • let alone specifically
foreign policy. If the Movement
as a whole engages in valuable and
potentially productive activity, it
will have organized and expanded
itself. Above all, we must
remember that one cannot ask
people to abandon their present
lives unless you have something
real to offer them. Apparently,
Stanford radicalism has not done
so on a sustained basis, but,
united as we are now against our
government, we can decide to
offer that something real to our
fellow students and to the
community outside.

Nearly everyone at the White
Pla/.a rally Monday (except
freshmen) must have felt a sense
of deja vu. We have been through
strikes before, and perhaps that is
why, objectively, so much of the
manpower for previous strikes has
come from each year's freshman
class. Hopefully by now, though,
all our social practice has helped
us to formulate some correct ideas
about successful strikes.
It is not hard to see where last
spring's Cambodia strike went
awry, for it is a problem that has
plagued almost every radical
movement in American
history—expansion so that new
members, more moderate to begin
with, will be content with more
moderate, reformist goals. That is
how the early feminists became a
movement for suffrage alone.
That is how black liberation
stopped demanding equality and
began to coalesce around Booker
T. Washington. That is how last
spring's strike moved from a strike

against the University to a bizarre
pluralism of dozens of competing
ineffectual protests which soon
became little more than an
amorphous accumulation of
"concern."
Two Truisms
What happens next is also easy
to see. Surely everyone
remembers the nagging feeling
that, since nothing is going on,
one might as well be in class.
Incredible efforts by radicals are
then required to keep students
from going to class—exhortation,
arousal of guilt, etc. The simple
truth is that IF SOMETHING
VALUABLE IS GOING ON,
STUDENTS WILL CUT CLASS
VOLUNTARILY (the corollary of
course being that if nothing is
going on they will not cut class at
all). The second truism is that,
even if a tremendous mass
movement does not emerge at
first, FIVE HUNDRED
STUDENTS DOING
SOMETHING WORTHWHILE IS
FAR BETTER THAN TWO
THOUSAND STUDENTS AT
THE BEACH.
This does not mean that
individual or small group projects
(from writing Senator McGovern
to trashing) should be
condemned, which would be a
waste of time anyway, but that
one strong ongoing effort exist
which will be attractive enough to
discourage adventurism or
pluralism. Such attraction will
depend on the effort having goals
which are both attainable and

significant, both of which require
their clear definition. People do
not sacrifice, students do not even
strike, over abstractions.
Two such suggestions follow.
Each will probably appeal to a
different philosophy and they
thus suggest the range, not the
limits, of discussion.
The first is a protracted effort
at education and organization in
the industrial park. The park
symbolizes everything wrong with
Stanford, as it shows how the
university's land policies, faculty
time, and philosophy of education
are geared to promotion of
American industrial expansion,
particularly overseas. Yet our
attention to it is generally limited
to a yearly march. An attempt to
set up educational centers at each
firm, to talk to employees, and
perhaps some large
demonstrations against firms will
require sustained effort yet should
be able to include all those who
wish to extend vocal protest to
America's Indochina campaign
beyond the elite campuses.
Victory to Victory
The other suggestion involves
concrete on-campus demands for
close monitoring and gradual
abolition of war research here and
at the Stanford Research
Institute. This is attractive
because of the work that has
recently been done implicating
(for example) the Computer
Center in direct strategic planning.

discourage adventurism or
pluralism. Such attraction will
depend on the effort having goals
which are both attainable and

significant, both of which require
their clear definition. People do
not sacrifice, students do not even
strike, over abstractions.
Two such suggestions follow.
Each will probably appeal to a
different philosophy and they
thus suggest the range, not the
limits, of discussion.
The first is a protracted effort
at education and organization in
the industrial park. The park
symbolizes everything wrong with
Stanford, as it shows how the
university's land policies, faculty
time, and philosophy of education
are geared to promotion of
American industrial expansion,
particularly overseas. Yet our
attention to it is generally limited
to a yearly march. An attempt to
set up educational centers at each
firm, to talk to employees, and
perhaps some large
demonstrations against firms will
require sustained effort yet should
be able to include all those who
wish to extend vocal protest to
America's Indochina campaign
beyond the elite campuses.
Victory to Victory
The other suggestion involves
concrete on-campus demands for
close monitoring and gradual
abolition of war research here and
at the Stanford Research
Institute. This is attractive
because of the work that has
recently been done implicating
(for example) the Computer
Center in direct strategic planning.
It is also attractive because it
involves a result that is attainable

through pressure on the faculty.
As anyone knows, a movement
gains strength and credibility
through moving from victory to
victory. If all the people who last
year were scattered around Encina
Hall or exhorting the dormitories
could unite for one effort on (say)
the Computer Center, a goal—any
important goal that will add
credibility to the Movement as an
effective force—will be much
closer than it would be if each
affinity group chooses its favorite
laboratory.
The man in White Plaza who
said that we ought to move off
the University and out into the
people where the power lies was
surely mistaken. If history teaches
anything at all it is that as
individuals we are absolutely
powerless to influence public
policy, • let alone specifically
foreign policy. If the Movement
as a whole engages in valuable and
potentially productive activity, it
will have organized and expanded
itself. Above all, we must
remember that one cannot ask
people to abandon their present
lives unless you have something
real to offer them. Apparently,
Stanford radicalism has not done
so on a sustained basis, but,
united as we are now against our
government, we can decide to
offer that something real to our
fellow students and to the
community outside.
