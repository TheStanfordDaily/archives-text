Students in this country seem to be losing the
ability to be outraged, no matter how outrageous
the acts committed in the world around them. It's
not clear whether it is merely because springtime,
the season for protest, has not yet come, or
whether the adage that "man is the only animal
that can get used to anything" is being proven
true.
But the reality is painfully clear. The United
States government is taking part in yet another
invasion of yet another Southeast Asian country.
Once again, the effort to "wind down the war"
has resulted in escalation and invasion. Yet these
stark reminders of the misery, brutality and
destruction the United States is inflicting daily on
the people of Indochina have caused little more
than a ripple in the United States.
And our voices, student voices, are being heard
only faintly, if at all.
Is it that the news of the invasion came so
gradually that no-one was surprised when the
official announcement was made? Is it really that
protests are out of season this month, and will
retnrn to the nations TV screens in April and May?
Or has a sense of weariness, a sense of frustration,
a sense of futility become so deeply ingrained on
American studerts action, any action, no
longer seems worthwhile?
We've been through demonstrations and
Freedom marches off the campus, in the South.
We've been through all types of campus
demonstrations, from the Free Speech Movement
up to last spring's student strikes. Some short-run
goals have been achieved â€” ROTC has been
removed from a number of campuses, and
classified research is no longer conducted here.
But the most central issue of student protest in
the last decade - the Indochinese war - has not
stopped, for all the sit-ins and strikes and trashings
that have gone on here and around the country.

As each new tactic was tried, as each new
effort came teach-ins, moratoriums, strikes - they
energized the students, and brought with them a
little hope that we could affect decision-makers in
this country. Kent State taught us the limit of
what tactics we could try. And it seems that the
almost unbearable slowness and inflexibility of
governmental machinery may have persuaded
many of us that trying is just not worth it.
At Stanford, a number of responses have
already been made. Sunday evening, a group of
students broke some windows here. This act, done
in an effort to show the "pigs" the solidarity that
the "people" here feel with Third World people, is
pitifully ineffectual, and potentially dangerous to
people inside the buildings being trashed.
Last night, a group of 200 in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium called for a student strike. At this
time, with most of the student body apparently
confused, undirected, and largely apathetic, it
seems this too will be an ineffectual form of
protest.
Efforts are now being made to start
letter-writing campaigns and to raise money for a
full-page ad in the Washington Post denouncing
the invasion. These efforts, and efforts to canvass
the community might have an effect on national
policy. But any effect these have will be minimal,
at best.
So where are we now 1 Has the impetus of the
last few years stopped and left us motionless, a
throwback to the Beat Generation? We don't think
students have gone that far yet. But all the
possibilities seem barren. We can only hope some
sort of a peaceful revolution will change the minds
of the American people and the brutal, wasteful
policies of the American government.
But from here this seems a long way away.
