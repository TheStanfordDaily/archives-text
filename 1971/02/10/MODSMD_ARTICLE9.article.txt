## Mass General Strike

The recent escalation of the
war in Southeast Asia has brought
immediate responses from many
sectors of the Stanford
community. The most visible signs
of response have been trashed
windows. Reflecting on these
destructive acts, I feel compelled
to speak against, even condemn,
such behavior.
I do not object to trashing and
fire-bombing because I believe
private (university) property is
somehow sacred and must be
preserved. And I am only partly
moved by the possibility that the
cost of damages may be passed on
to students. (I would add also that
if Stanford is at all committed to
minority groups, broken windows
would not mean fewer
scholarships). I react negatively to
any destruction, to property or to
person, if it reflects
misapprehensions and frustration
on the part of the activists.
Lack of Understanding
The lack of understanding of
the scope and implications of a

political/historical situation is
regrettable in itself, but it is a
tragedy when it is used as a
justification for action. It is true
that we do not know exactly how
and to what extent the United
States is prosecuting the war—and
we suspect the worse—yet it is not
reasonable to justify violence with
the rumor of a greater violence,
e.g., the possible U.S. use of
tactical nuclear weapons.
Furthermore, if it is likely that
violence will cause retaliation and
greater repression, it is
irresponsible and stupid—our
black brothers in the ghettoes can
attest to that. And who would be
"guilty" if the community of
Stanford is torn apart physically
and emotionally from within. Is it
only those who carry out acts of
violence? Can the moderate
majority of students, staff, and
faculty who also oppose the war
be blameless if they do not speak
out against tactics which they do
not approve.
And if it is frustration that

breeds the desire to trash,
frustration borne out of the
paranoia that it is elements at this
University who may be the
oppressors of the Third World,
and frustration mixed with
despair because others do not
seem to share my anguish about
the war, does it mean that affinity
groups are formed to wage a holy
war against people and
institutions who do not hold the
faith or see THE TRUTH!?!
I, personally, am greatly
disturbed when at a rally someone
who proposes an action other
than storming the President's
house (the one on the hill on
campus or even the one in
Washington) is greeted with cries
of "Pig" and "Motherfucker." I
have, as do many others,
considerable doubts about the
efficacy of "working within the
system," but I try very hard to
discern who my "enemy" really
is, and it is not the fellow who is
trying to communicate with his
congressman or who is passing out
petitions.
Community Strike
What actions make sense then?
I have often thought of one— this
balloon was once floated before.a
gathering of faculty friends and
was quickly shot down—the
General Strike. I do not mean
shutting down the University or
all the universities in the country ;
we who work and study at these
institutions know well the
irrelevance we, as academics, are
to society in general. This is not
to say that the resources of a
university cannot be mobilized in
an anti-war movement, rather it is
to say that closing Stanford, a
goal espoused by many recent
rally performers, only feeds the
egos of these campus leaders. I am
thinking about a general, mass
strike of the community, one that
would not allow "business and life
as usual." Unless anti-war
activities leave the campus and
move into the towns, Middle
America will not be persuaded to
oppose Mr. Nixon's way of
"winding down the war."
Imagine this scenario. The
Stanford community, the heads of
its members sufficiently together,
moves out to the Mid-peninsula
community spreading the word
that for one day or for one week
we will not conduct business as
usual. Daily economic activities
would be suspended temporarily.
Consumption of durable goods
would be postponed indefinitely.
Bank of America would agree not
to clear checks for its depositors,
tying up the exchange of goods
and services. People whose days
were disrupted would have time
to think about the war and would
understand that the war has
affected them economically for a
time much longer than a day.
Articulation of demands to end
the war and to make peace would
then follow from the people, and
not just from the "commies" and
crazies on the campuses. This
brief outline may be a dream, a
fanciful one at that, but to me it
is one that makes more sense than
the reverie that breaking a
window will end the war.
