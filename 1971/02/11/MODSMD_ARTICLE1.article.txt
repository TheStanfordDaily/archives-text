# Unknown Assailant Shoots 2 Last Night; Radicals, Police Clash At Comp Center
## 
### ED KOHN 
Two students were shot, at least
three persons were briefly hospitalized
with injuries and eight persons arrested
last night as 20 0 radicals clashed with
police and Free Campus Movement
members near the Undergraduate
Library.
Earlier in the day, students and
police clashed near Pine 11*11, the
University's computation center,
following a three-hour takeover of that
$5 million facility. Four persons were
arrested following that incident.
John Dawson, 16, a Gunn High
School student and son of Assoc.
History Prof. J. Phillip Dawson, was
shot in the right thigh, possibly by a
.45 calibre automatic pistol as he stood
with a group of six FCM members in a
parking lot adjacent to Owens House
on Salvatierra St.
All police agencies on campus last
night use .38 special calibre.
Dawson was being treated in the
emergency room at Stanford Hospital.
According to a hospital spokesman, he
was in "fair condition" early this
morning. Witnesses at the shooting
reported that at least six shots were
fired in the direction of the group.
Second Student Shot
Police later issued an all points
bulletin for a 25-year old white male,
s '-10", wearing a brown or tan coat
and driving a faded red Volkswagon
with California license plates.
The other student shot was
identified as Doug Lempereur, a senior
History major who lives at the DKE
house. He went to the hospital, where
the wound—a bullet graze in one
thigh—was diagnosed, but treatment
was not necessary. Lempereur was with
the FCM group near Owens House.
Prof. Dawson said last night that his
son is not a member of the FCM.
Lempereur's political affiliation could
not be immediately determined.
FCM-Demonstrators Clash
Several bitter fights broke out
between photographers and
by-standers—some of whom were
apparently FCM members—and the
fired-up demonstrators. One FCM
member, Claude Long, was hospitalized
with feet, back and head injuries. Other
persons reported being struck with
rocks, bricks and heavy flag staffs. One
person reported being struck in the
mouth by a male holding a rock in his
fist.
Ed Jagels, an FCM member, said his
group planned to press charges and said
that he anticipated the arrest of at least
one University student.
Cowell Health Center reported early
this morning that six students had been
treated for varying injuries sustained
during the evening. One of the students
at Cowell was treated for club wounds.
New Police Tactics
The police last night used a tactic
never before seen on the Stanford
campus—following demonstrators into
dormitory rooms. During the course of
the evening, squads of police entered at
least two buildings, Stern-Larkin and
Crothers Memorial. At least one person
was arrested in Lark in.
Last night's trouble errupted after a
meeting in the Old Union courtyard
that had been called to discuss ways of
implementing the student strike called
to protest the invasion of Laos. After

deciding to hold a march today from
the scheduled noon rally to either SHI
or the Industrial Park, the group voted
to declare a state of "peoples' war" on
campus and began a march to the
dorms. Some 4 00 persons were in the
march with it left the Old Union.
Affinity Groups
The group left the courtyard, and
passing through White Plaza, became
embroiled in one of the first fights of
the evening with FCM members and
photographers. After a five-minute
delay, it moved past the back side of
the bookstore, breaking several
windows despite cries of "no rocks",
and down to the lower level of the
UGLY. Several police units moved into
position near the demonstrators, who
continued their march down Escondido
St., through Wilbur, and back to the
Wilbur lawn.
It paused there for a few moments
to permit formation of affinity groups
"to do what has to be done, on any
level it can be done" and moved out
onto Escondido St. again. About 200
people left the Wilbur lawn.
But the group was nearly
surrounded by the police forces as it
headed back towards the UGLY, and it
turned back into the intersection of
Escondido and Galvez Sts. Police in full
riot gear then moved up, occupying the
nearby parking lots, fields, walkways
and bushes. The situation was static for
a few moments, and then the police
began swarming down toward the
demonstrators, who at first responded
with hoots, jeers and rocks, but then
panicked and began to run. As some
demonstrators moved into the nearby
dorms, police followed them, arresting
several.
Police Chase Demonstrators
Police then chased most of the
demonstrators out of the intersection,
declared the group to be an illegal
assembly, and threatened to arrest a
Daily reporter. Less than a minute
later, a Daily photographer was maced
and nearly run over by a squad car.
Dawson and Lempereur were shot
moments later about IV2 blocks away.
The demonstrators then broke up
into small groups, roaming the campus.
Several false fire alarms were turned in,
and numerous firecrackers were set off
throughout the academic area. Some
trashing in the academic regions also
reportedly took place.
The North County Jail, where those
arrested last night were taken for
booking, reported a bomb threat, but
the building was not evacuated. The
bomb, the called told sheriffs, would go
off unless "all political prisoners are
freed."
Quiet returned to the campus
shortly after 1:00 a.m., but the area
was under exceedingly heavy patrol by

sheriffs on foot and in squad cars.
Tactical Squad members patrolled the
White Plaza-quad region.
Of the eight persons, six had been
booked as of early this morning: Leslie
K. Nassan, a non-student, for resisting
arrest and disturbing the peace; lan
Frazier, a non-student, assault with a
deadly weapon; James Wrigley, a
non-student, disturbing the peace and
interfering; and Michel Holman, a
sophomore in General Studies,
interfering. Two other juveniles also
were booked early this morning.
Earlier in the day, 8 0 police and 150
demonstrators clashed near the
$5-million computation center, which
the protestors had occupied and shut
down for most of the afternoon.
Four Arrested
Four persons were arrested near the
building on charges of failure to
disperse and remaining at the site of a
riot without dispersing. Several persons
were injured as club-swinging police
charged the crowd after a
confrontation between Sheriffs
Sargeant Don Tamm and Associate
Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Those arrested were Theresa
Ramirez and Sharon Winslow,
sophomores in General Studies; James
Little, an acting assistant professor in
Statistics; and Tony Gray, identified as
a "community worker" by suspended
English T.A. Janet Weiss. Little was
released on bail last night at 11:3 0, but
the three girls were still being held in
North County Jail in lieu of the $630
bail fee.
Damage to the computer, located in
Pine Hall, was estimated at $1,000.
Loss of revenue from "down time" —
the period when the computer is
inoperable — was estimated at $600 per
hour.
When the demonstrators cut the
power supply shortly before 1 :30 p.m.,
the computer "crashed," and
computation center officials estimated
that it could not be "brought up" again
before midnight. Most of the damage
was caused by ripped wires and the
handling of some memory tapes being
stored in the center.
The computation center was shut
down after about 300 persons left a
noon rally in White Plaza and marched,
chanting various anti-war slogans, to
the building.
When it arrived at Pine Hall, the
group found signs on all the doors
reading, "Sorry, Computer Center
Temporarily Closed." After some
discussion, one of the gates in the rear
of the building was forced open, and
the crowd swarmed into the loading
zone area. Ladders were also brought to
the scene, and some demonstrators
gained access to the roof
