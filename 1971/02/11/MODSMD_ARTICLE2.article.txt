# Marines Gather Off South Vietnam Coast

SAIGON (AP) — The United States has
rushed a special landing force of 1,5 00
Marines armed with artillery and tanks
off South Vietnam's northern coast to
counter a possible North Vietnamese
thrust in retaliation for the Laos
incursion, it was learned Thursday.
South Vietnamese forces penetrated
25 miles into southern Laos on
Wednesday and seized the major enemy
supply center of Sepone, apparently
against little resistance.
Veteran Marines of the 3rd Division,
which operated along the DMZ until it
was withdrawn from South Vietnam in
1969, are reported standing off the
northern coast on ships of the 7 th
Fleet.
The U.S. Command said it would
have no comment.
Big Laos Push
A 29,000-man allied drive is under
way in the northern quadrant of South
Vietnam and Laos.
South Vietnamese troops, with the
full range of U.S. air support, pushed
into Laos last Monday in efforts to cut
North Vietnam's Mo Chi Minh trail

supply network. Nine thousand
American troops are acting as a
blocking force on the Vietnamese side
of the border.
The Laos operation raised fears of a
massive North Vietnamese attack
against U.S. troops across the DMZ and
Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky said
South Vietnamese forces might invade
the North to cut off the enemy's rear
supply bases.
Three Divisions Wait
Hanoi is believed to have elements
of three divisions inside North Vietnam
within marching distance of the DMZ.
Senior Defense Department officials
said Wednesday Hanoi may be deterred
from sending reinforcements to
challenge the allied offensive in
because of fear that the South
Vietnamese may invade North
Vietnam.
However, one official emphasized he
was not implying such an attack is
contemplated, but noting only that it is
a possibility the enemy could not
afford to overlook.
Sepone, a main transshipment point

and operations base on the Ho Chi
Minh trail, was the first major objective
of the drive into Laos. It had been
bombed heavily and was reported
almost deserted earlier.
The U.S. Command said Thursday
that American teams are flown into
Laos to recover downed helicopters. It
added they were protected by South
Vietnamese troops because no U.S.
ground forces can enter Laos.
The command was commenting on
publishing reports that up to 100
American soldiers had gone into Laos.
IYoops Mistaken
"If the troops thought they were in
Laos they were mistaken," said a
spokesman. "They are operating only
on the Vietnam side of the border."
The report quoted the Sanh troops
as saying up to 100 men of the 3rd
Platoon, 7 th Battalion, 17 th Air
Cavalry, a unit of the 101st Airborne
Division, had gone into Laos with a
special team, apparently referring to a
helicopter recovery unit.
In Washington, Secretary of State
William P. Rogers said U.S. troops

remaining in Vietnam after May 1 will
be assigned outside the combat area. "I
don't want to say they will be totally
out of a combat role," he told
newsmen, "but for all major combat
assignments they will be out."
Indonesia Conference
Sen. George L). Aiken proposed
Wednesday that the Southeast Asian
nations undertake a new effort to bring
peace to Indochina by convening their
own international conference, in Asia.
The Vermonter who is dean of
Senate Republicans told the Senate
"Congress will rightfully rebel" at
repeated administration requests at
six-month intervals "for large subsidies
for Indochina without any new
justification."
In calling for a conference, he said,
"The time has come for nations to
recognize that formal peace among the
parties in Indochina will only come as a
result of agreement among themselves,"
he added. "It cannot be imposed by
others."
lie said the United States might take
part in I he conference if invited.
