The shit lias come home. I In; "peoples war has hit its hrutal ami
bloody marks on our campus and in our minds. Stanford last night
was a grotesque, unreal battlefield where two people could be shot
standing in a parking lot outside the I'ree (.ampus Movements
headquarters, where the light ol a camera s Hash could enrage radicals
enough to beat an I'(>M'er unconscious near Mem (daw, where riot
police could run through dormitory halls, billy clubs ready to swing
down on students.
Last night Bruce Franklin told a gathering in the Old Union
courtyard that the "peoples' war" should be waged on campus, to get
rid of the "occupation troops.'
But how far does the "peoples war go! 1 Who is the enemy?
FCM'ers? Photographers? Anyone who gets in the radicals' way, and
thereby becomes a danger to the "people'
Who brought these occupation troops on campus? Radicals in the
past have made this an avowed goal, to "heighten the contradictions"
in the University. That goal was accomplished last night. Contusion,
fear and revulsion are now everywhere on campus. II we are to ask
why, we must look to the same radicals who brought it home to us,
some of whom believe that people actively opposing them | pigs J
should be beaten unconscious, should be trashed, should be otfed.
Actions such as these are simply inhuman. Inhuman also is the
desire to create an atmosphere ol hatred and violence in which people
can be shot at in the night. Radical inhumanity is the same as
institutional or governmental inhumanity—sickeningly obscene.
Yet while the responsibility lor last night's events rests lar more

with the radicals than any other individuals, they arc not the only
ones to be condemned. I'ast actions of FCM'ers have hardly been
designed to attract the friendship ol radicals—they have made efforts
at every turn to provoke radicals. While this is no excuse for attacks
such as last night's, such provocation is yet another cause of the
polarization and hatred that brought blood to the campus last night.
Neither is the University or its President blameless. We share the
frustration of many students who cannot understand why Richard
Lyman, a man who has claimed to oppose the war, will issue no strong
statement in protest of its escalation into Laos.
The atmosphere of violence which now pervades this campus must
be ended before we become another Kent State. We have come too
close already.
Both the violence that people within the University take part in
and the violence which the University is part of must cease. Contracts
made by any University facility must be subject to the scrutiny ol thr
Stanford community, and no contract which contributed directly to
the waging of war or the science of killing should be allowed.
In addition, every individual on the campus must think, think and
think again about the latent violence on this campus, about the
polarization and hatred which we have tolerated and the violence it
lias brought, and about world-wide violence and how Stanford
contributes to this.
Those radicals who glory in violent confrontation must bear the
brunt of the blame for turning the University into a batlefield. The
casualties incurred in the "peoples' war" are on their heads.

Neither is the University or its President blameless. We share the
frustration of many students who cannot understand why Richard
Lyman, a man who has claimed to oppose the war, will issue no strong
statement in protest of its escalation into Laos.
The atmosphere of violence which now pervades this campus must
be ended before we become another Kent State. We have come too
close already.
Both the violence that people within the University take part in
and the violence which the University is part of must cease. Contracts
made by any University facility must be subject to the scrutiny ol thr
Stanford community, and no contract which contributed directly to
the waging of war or the science of killing should be allowed.
In addition, every individual on the campus must think, think and
think again about the latent violence on this campus, about the
polarization and hatred which we have tolerated and the violence it
lias brought, and about world-wide violence and how Stanford
contributes to this.
Those radicals who glory in violent confrontation must bear the
brunt of the blame for turning the University into a batlefield. The
casualties incurred in the "peoples' war" are on their heads.

was a grotesque, unreal battlefield where two people could be shot

Actions such as these are simply inhuman. Inhuman also is the
desire to create an atmosphere ol hatred and violence in which people
can be shot at in the night. Radical inhumanity is the same as
institutional or governmental inhumanity—sickeningly obscene.
Yet while the responsibility lor last night's events rests lar more

with the radicals than any other individuals, they arc not the only
ones to be condemned. I'ast actions of FCM'ers have hardly been
designed to attract the friendship ol radicals—they have made efforts
at every turn to provoke radicals. While this is no excuse for attacks
such as last night's, such provocation is yet another cause of the
polarization and hatred that brought blood to the campus last night.
