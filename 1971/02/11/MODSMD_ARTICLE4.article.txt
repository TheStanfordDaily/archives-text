The despicable violation of the
Geneva Accords and Laotian
sovereignty by the South
Vietnamese army, aided and
abetted by the United States
government and institutions and,
at least indirectly, by the United
States citizenry, warrants stern
repudiation and active dissent at
all levels by all individuals in
"our" country. Our government's
flagrant deceit in Indochina and at
home ar.d the betrayal of all
humanitarian and national
interests time and time again
necessitates genuine outrage and
active protest and dissention by
every Stanford student, professor,
employee, and administrative
worker. All segments of Stanford
must act in concert as a
community in the vanguard or a
wave of intense protest across the
United States. The foreign
adventures and meddling of our
government must be stopped and
can be stopped by the united
actions of all Americans.
A crusted bureaucrat, John
Locke, once wrote, "Great

mistakes in the ruling part, many
wrong and inconvenient laws, and
all the slips of human frailty, will
be born by the people without
mutiny or murmur. But if a long
train of abuses, prevarications,
and artifices, all tending the same
way, make the design visible to
the people, and they cannot but
feel what they lie under, and see
whether they are going; it is not
to be wondered, that they should
then rouse themselves."
The administration of our
country must be served notice
that we are beyond those limits of
toleration.

The Stanford YWCA supports
the following National YWCA
stand which we feel must be
emphasized in light of the
impending trial of Angela Davis:
"Noting that most black
Americans and many of other
minorities are convinced that they
do not receive impartial justice

through our present judicial
procedures, and that they cite
excessive bail and preventive
detention as evidence of such bias,
the YWCA is concerned that all
which is possible be done to
insure that a woman, a black
woman, a black woman associated
with controversial issues and
causes, be granted equal and
impartial justice as guaranteed to
all citizens by the Constitution of
the United States.
"National leaders, the mass
media, and we as citizens can do
much to maintain the climate of
public opinion in which guilt or
innocence is not prejudged and
equal and impartial justice is
assured to all."

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is with increasing despair
that I have observed the
developing United States and
South Vietnamese involvement in
Laos. To have time and time again
committed myself to, and worked
for, what I believe to be right only
to have it daily ignored and
scorned has truly left me with
grief. I recognize that for the last
year, and especially in the course
of the last week, I have been
manipulated and counted upon to
remain apathetic. Still within me
there is a fierce rage, now so great
mat I am scared to respond to it,
recognizing that it may well lead
me into armed violence. I still
believe that to be either apathetic
or violent will only play into the
hands of militarism and ensure the
continuity of its way.
Furthermore, I have discovered
in the last year, that at least for
myself a politico-economic view
of the world deadens and shallows
my basic humanity and life values.
The result is that I find myself up
against the wall with virtually
nowhere to turn. Yet, in the face
of this I find that I must again try
to affirm my beliefs by joining
with those who feel as I do in the
hopes of convincing others
through our humanity and the
sincerity of our beliefs. I thus urge
you to join with me in the
struggle for peace.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am disturbed by several
recent comments in the Daily on
the right to speak at Stanford.
These comments argue that one
man's judgment on the morality
or wisdom of another's words and
actions gives him the right to
silence the speaker. Some even
seem to say that this right
becomes a duty if one is in the
minority.
It is appalling and dispiriting to
hear these tired arguments on a
great American campus. Every
despot, every inquisitor, every
censor, every demagogue
throughout history has offered
them as his justification for the
repression of oppositional
thought.
It is hardly credible that the
most elemental principle of Free
Speech should, after centuries of
struggle to achieve it, be so little
valued by those who are the major
beneficiaries of it - academicians
and those holding minority views.
The spirit of liberty, said Judge
■ Learned Hand, "is the spirit which
is not too sure that it is right."
That spirit is also the essence of
free speech at Stanford. It means
that learning never stops, that
every idea is subject to question.
It means not only the right to
so that others may be
persuaded. It means those rights
for the minority, whether of one
or one hundred; it also means
those rights for the majority.
No one need listen to another's
speech at Stanford. Anyone may
challenge the statements of
another. But the challenge must
not be a shouting match, or a
shouting down, if the rest of the
community is to judge the ideas
involved.

free speech at Stanford. It means
that learning never stops, that
every idea is subject to question.
It means not only the right to
so that others may be
persuaded. It means those rights
for the minority, whether of one
or one hundred; it also means
those rights for the majority.
No one need listen to another's
speech at Stanford. Anyone may
challenge the statements of
another. But the challenge must
not be a shouting match, or a
shouting down, if the rest of the
community is to judge the ideas
involved.

The despicable violation of the
Geneva Accords and Laotian
sovereignty by the South
Vietnamese army, aided and
abetted by the United States
government and institutions and,
at least indirectly, by the United
States citizenry, warrants stern
repudiation and active dissent at
all levels by all individuals in
"our" country. Our government's
flagrant deceit in Indochina and at
home ar.d the betrayal of all
humanitarian and national
interests time and time again
necessitates genuine outrage and
active protest and dissention by
every Stanford student, professor,
employee, and administrative
worker. All segments of Stanford
must act in concert as a
community in the vanguard or a
wave of intense protest across the
United States. The foreign
adventures and meddling of our
government must be stopped and
can be stopped by the united
actions of all Americans.
A crusted bureaucrat, John
Locke, once wrote, "Great

mistakes in the ruling part, many
wrong and inconvenient laws, and
all the slips of human frailty, will
be born by the people without
mutiny or murmur. But if a long
train of abuses, prevarications,
and artifices, all tending the same
way, make the design visible to
the people, and they cannot but
feel what they lie under, and see
whether they are going; it is not
to be wondered, that they should
then rouse themselves."
The administration of our
country must be served notice
that we are beyond those limits of
toleration.

The Stanford YWCA supports
the following National YWCA
stand which we feel must be
emphasized in light of the
impending trial of Angela Davis:
"Noting that most black
Americans and many of other
minorities are convinced that they
do not receive impartial justice

through our present judicial
procedures, and that they cite
excessive bail and preventive
detention as evidence of such bias,
the YWCA is concerned that all
which is possible be done to
insure that a woman, a black
woman, a black woman associated
with controversial issues and
causes, be granted equal and
impartial justice as guaranteed to
all citizens by the Constitution of
the United States.
"National leaders, the mass

much to maintain the climate of
public opinion in which guilt or
innocence is not prejudged and
equal and impartial justice is
assured to all."

It is with increasing despair
that I have observed the
developing United States and
South Vietnamese involvement in
Laos. To have time and time again
committed myself to, and worked
for, what I believe to be right only
to have it daily ignored and
scorned has truly left me with
grief. I recognize that for the last
year, and especially in the course
of the last week, I have been
manipulated and counted upon to
remain apathetic. Still within me
there is a fierce rage, now so great
mat I am scared to respond to it,
recognizing that it may well lead
me into armed violence. I still
believe that to be either apathetic
or violent will only play into the
hands of militarism and ensure the
continuity of its way.
Furthermore, I have discovered
in the last year, that at least for
myself a politico-economic view
of the world deadens and shallows
my basic humanity and life values.
The result is that I find myself up
against the wall with virtually
nowhere to turn. Yet, in the face
of this I find that I must again try
to affirm my beliefs by joining
with those who feel as I do in the
hopes of convincing others
through our humanity and the
sincerity of our beliefs. I thus urge
you to join with me in the

I am disturbed by several
recent comments in the Daily on
the right to speak at Stanford.
These comments argue that one
man's judgment on the morality
or wisdom of another's words and
actions gives him the right to
silence the speaker. Some even
seem to say that this right
becomes a duty if one is in the
minority.
It is appalling and dispiriting to
hear these tired arguments on a
great American campus. Every
despot, every inquisitor, every
censor, every demagogue
throughout history has offered
them as his justification for the
repression of oppositional
thought.
It is hardly credible that the
most elemental principle of Free
Speech should, after centuries of
struggle to achieve it, be so little
valued by those who are the major
beneficiaries of it - academicians
and those holding minority views.
The spirit of liberty, said Judge
■ Learned Hand, "is the spirit which
is not too sure that it is right."
That spirit is also the essence of
free speech at Stanford. It means
that learning never stops, that

hear these tired arguments on a
great American campus. Every
despot, every inquisitor, every
censor, every demagogue
throughout history has offered
them as his justification for the
repression of oppositional
thought.
It is hardly credible that the
most elemental principle of Free
Speech should, after centuries of
struggle to achieve it, be so little
valued by those who are the major
beneficiaries of it - academicians
and those holding minority views.
The spirit of liberty, said Judge
■ Learned Hand, "is the spirit which
is not too sure that it is right."
That spirit is also the essence of
free speech at Stanford. It means
that learning never stops, that
every idea is subject to question.
It means not only the right to
so that others may be
persuaded. It means those rights
for the minority, whether of one
or one hundred; it also means
those rights for the majority.
No one need listen to another's
speech at Stanford. Anyone may
challenge the statements of
another. But the challenge must
not be a shouting match, or a
shouting down, if the rest of the
community is to judge the ideas
involved.

The despicable violation of the
Geneva Accords and Laotian
sovereignty by the South
Vietnamese army, aided and
abetted by the United States
government and institutions and,
at least indirectly, by the United
States citizenry, warrants stern
repudiation and active dissent at
all levels by all individuals in
"our" country. Our government's
flagrant deceit in Indochina and at
home ar.d the betrayal of all
humanitarian and national
interests time and time again
necessitates genuine outrage and
active protest and dissention by
every Stanford student, professor,
employee, and administrative
worker. All segments of Stanford
must act in concert as a
community in the vanguard or a
wave of intense protest across the
United States. The foreign
adventures and meddling of our
government must be stopped and
can be stopped by the united
actions of all Americans.
A crusted bureaucrat, John
Locke, once wrote, "Great

mistakes in the ruling part, many
wrong and inconvenient laws, and
all the slips of human frailty, will
be born by the people without
mutiny or murmur. But if a long
train of abuses, prevarications,
and artifices, all tending the same
way, make the design visible to
the people, and they cannot but
feel what they lie under, and see
whether they are going; it is not
to be wondered, that they should
then rouse themselves."
The administration of our
country must be served notice
that we are beyond those limits of
toleration.

The Stanford YWCA supports
the following National YWCA
stand which we feel must be
emphasized in light of the
impending trial of Angela Davis:
"Noting that most black
Americans and many of other
minorities are convinced that they
do not receive impartial justice

through our present judicial
procedures, and that they cite
excessive bail and preventive
detention as evidence of such bias,
the YWCA is concerned that all
which is possible be done to
insure that a woman, a black
woman, a black woman associated
with controversial issues and
causes, be granted equal and
impartial justice as guaranteed to
all citizens by the Constitution of
the United States.
"National leaders, the mass
media, and we as citizens can do
much to maintain the climate of
public opinion in which guilt or
innocence is not prejudged and
equal and impartial justice is
assured to all."

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is with increasing despair
that I have observed the
developing United States and
South Vietnamese involvement in
Laos. To have time and time again
committed myself to, and worked
for, what I believe to be right only
to have it daily ignored and
scorned has truly left me with
grief. I recognize that for the last
year, and especially in the course
of the last week, I have been
manipulated and counted upon to
remain apathetic. Still within me
there is a fierce rage, now so great
mat I am scared to respond to it,
recognizing that it may well lead
me into armed violence. I still
believe that to be either apathetic
or violent will only play into the
hands of militarism and ensure the
continuity of its way.
Furthermore, I have discovered
in the last year, that at least for
myself a politico-economic view
of the world deadens and shallows
my basic humanity and life values.
The result is that I find myself up
against the wall with virtually
nowhere to turn. Yet, in the face
of this I find that I must again try
to affirm my beliefs by joining
with those who feel as I do in the
hopes of convincing others
through our humanity and the
sincerity of our beliefs. I thus urge
you to join with me in the
struggle for peace.

I am disturbed by several
recent comments in the Daily on
the right to speak at Stanford.
These comments argue that one
man's judgment on the morality
or wisdom of another's words and
actions gives him the right to
silence the speaker. Some even
seem to say that this right
becomes a duty if one is in the
minority.
It is appalling and dispiriting to
