Quake Deaths Rise
LOS ANGELES — The toll of dead continue to rise and
property damage mounted into the hundreds of millions
Wednesday as Southern California continued to quiver
from aftershocks of Tuesday's devastating earthquake.
Workers searched the ruins of a veterans hospital where
the bodies of 33 patients and employees had been found.
They said 10 persons still are missing. In all, authorities
tallied deaths, nine by heart attack. More than 1,000
persons were injured.
Fears of a rupture in the cracked dam of the city's
largest reservoir eased as the water level fell, due to
draining. The 80,000 persons evacuated from the area
were not allowed to return but officials said only a
powerful new shock could cause trouble.
Attention centered on the VA hospital at Sylmar in the
west end of the San Fernando Valley just 10 miles from
the quake's center. Some 250 workmen probed the steel

and concrete rubble of two collapsed three-story ward
buildings.
Well over 100 patients and employees were inside when
the 6:01 a.m. tremor shook the 45-year-old structure
apart. Scores were injured and additional scores trapped.
For nearly 24 hours moans and cries came from victims
trapped alive. Many injured were extricated and flown by
helicopter to other hospitals.
Authorities said there was little chance of additional
survivors.
Tuna Boat Seized
SAN DIEGO — The 65 0 -ton seiner John F. Kennedy was
fired upon and seized Wednesday by an Ecuadorian
gunboat, the American Tunaboat Association reported.
This brings to 18 the number of American fishing
vessels seized this year by Ecuador.
Ecuador claims its territorial fishing rights extend 200
miles offshore, the United States recognizes a 12-mile
limit.
