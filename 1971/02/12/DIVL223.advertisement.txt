Yesterday afternoon, the
University Rumor Verification
Center became operational. It
will operate as it did last year,
providing accurate double
checked information on
rumors, problems, and
questions.
It will be nonpartisan,
dedicated solely to maintaining
(insofar as possible) a
nonviolent campus
community. For information
call 326-9241.
