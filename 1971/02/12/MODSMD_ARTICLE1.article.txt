# Urges Compassion
## Lyman Calls For Reason 
### 
In two KZSU broadcasts last night,
President Lyman urged community
members to stay away from meetings,
disruptions and marches, asking that all
"refuse to be drawn into the frankly
declared attempt to reproduce as much
of the war as possible on the Stanford
University campus."
"The job of ending the war is tough
enough without these ego trips
masquerading as revolution," he
argued. The issue is not "this or that
tactic of warfare.. . this issue is
whether we are going to be able to
continue as a place of learning and
debate..."
Concomitantly, he asked the
community to support "vigorous and
fair prosecution of criminal acts." The
University should be a place where
"people prepare for "intelligent and
informed attacks on the problems," he
added in the brief five minute speech.
In an attempt to justify police
actions Wednesday afternoon, Lyman
compared the loss of the expensive
computer to the burning of the
Behavioral Sciences building last
Spring.
"In the Stanford Computer Center
right now are programs connected with
research projects on such subjects as an
analysis of Supreme Court cases;
investigating the possibility of
developing what is called a negative
income tax aid of the poverty-stricken;
analyses of patient care monitoring
systems for hospitals, and so forth."
"In that 'mere machine' resides
months and years of devoted research
and learning of countless individuals."
He pointed out that computers had
been destroyed elsewhere by
movements with the same tactics and
aims as Venceremos here.

To that argument he added the fact
that there is no distinction between
costs to the University and costs to the
people in it. "Perhaps some of our
self-appointed revolutionary saviors can
afford these things; "he argued, "most
of us cannot."
Deplores 'Obscene' War
Deploring the credibility crisis
heightened by events in Laos and the
"obscene war", he went on to attack
recent radical tactics.
The strikers "showed a remarkable
lack of any serious attempt to get
answers to their questions concerning
the war in Indochina and the
University's asserted connection with
it . . . "he declared.
The SJC defendants "succeeded in
using the hearing as a platform for their
political views, because the council
made every effort to be fair," he
pointed out; retracing radical tactics all
the way to the Lodge disruption.
He continued the criticism, saying
that "every effort will be made—has
been made—to cloud and confuse the
issues at Stanford."
In a closing statement, he pointed
out that of the ten injuried treated at
Cowell Health Center as a result of

Wednesday's events, only one was
reported as a clubbing and might be
attributed to police action. Seven were
caused by fights and beatings in the
crowd. Two were of unknown causes.
He urged all community members to
stay away from escapades at night
when the chances for confusion and
mistakes are maximized by darkness,
"—resist hysteria and, despite the
tensions and frustrations of this time,
that you try, within the limits imposed
on "all of us by our human condition, to
live a life of reason and compassion."
At a general meeting yesterday
evening, Lyman's statement
encountered a tremendous amount of
criticism from radicals.
Teresa Ramirez, arrested at the
computer center yesterday, said that
"Lyman is doing his best to frighten
us."
Janet Weiss continued, saying that
Lyman "is afraid of us and is trying to
terrorize us. He is trying to isloate us
from other people on campus." She
added that the only reason he has
called police onto campus is because
"We have been effective and he can't
deal with us. It is important not to
knuckle under his heavy hand."


HO, HO, HO—High school revolutionaries hit the anti-war movement yesterday as these girls led the way to the Stanford
Industrial Park. The march also included a rally in front of Hoover Tower.
