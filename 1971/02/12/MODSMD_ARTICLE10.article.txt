fcm macing ?
On Wednesday, February 10 I
attended the anti-war rally in
front of the Old Union at
Stanford. As the rally broke up to
go to the dorms, I moved ahead of
the main body of the crowd
toward the plastic dome, where I
was to meet the persons I came
with, and then to leave campus. I
was walking alone on the grass,
just above the claw and about 20
yards in front of the crowd. Three
or four men, in plain clothes, were
in the upper area of the grass,
almost to the pavement, all of
them to my left. I heard a man's
voice to my left scream "What are
you doing?" I turned and about
10 feet from me, a person who
has been identified to me in the
past as a FCM member was
holding a police night stick over
the man and then sprayed mace in
his face. I stopped to observe the
incident, which was over in about
30 seconds.
I turned to walk away and was
hit from behind on the back of
my head. I turned around and it
was the same FCMer who had hit
the other man. He raised his club
again and I blocked the hit with
my arm. He grabbed my arm, held
me for a moment and attempted
to mace me in the eyes. I put my
head down, flung myself around,
screamed for help and broke lose
and ran toward the crowd. About
20 or 30 people from the crowd
which was very close to me by
that time, ran forward after the
man. I went back to the dome,
met my friends and left for the
coffee house. I do not know if the
man who attacked me is the same
as the one who was beaten. He did
have a camera around his neck. I
intend to file suit against this
member of the Free Campus
Movement for assualt and battery

and am investigating the
possibilities of having him charged
with the possession of illegal
equipment (the mace).

Editor, THE DAILY:
People going out to raise
money and get signatures for the
Washington Post Ad adainst the
war are being supplied by the
organizers with a cloth money
collection bag with Well's Fargo
Bank stamped boldly across the
front.
Chairman of Well's Farge Bank
is Ernest Arbuckle, chairman of
SRI, ex-dean of Stanford business
School. Arbuckel is a director of

Utah Mining and Construction
Corp, which built the B-5 2 base in
Thailand, the current launching
pad for much of the current
bombing; also a director of Castle
and Cooke, which has various
investments in S.E. Asia, and
Hewlett Packard, which does war
related research.
As a small individual act of
conscience, we suggest that those
going out to canvass for the ad
substitute a plain brown bag for
the Well's Fargo's publicity.
Resistance to the war means
resistance to those making the
war.
For more information on Mr.
Arbuckle, or other members of
the board of Well's Fargo, see
your local Inquisition member.
