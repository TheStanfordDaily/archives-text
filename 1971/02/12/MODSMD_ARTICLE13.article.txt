# Saroyan Play Jerks Heartstrings
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
ACT made its contribution to
the preservation of sentiment last
week with the opening of William
Soroyan's "The Time of Your
Life."
In addition to being a naturally
sentimental play, "The Time of
Your Life" is bound to pluck
some older heartstrings (those
that have been around for forty

years or more), for this 1 939 play
exudes a 1939 feeling like some
of the movies in Clive Miller's
Palace of Culture.
Maybe it's not a true 1939
feeling, but rather a 1939 style of
acting and writing that is evoked.
Whatever it is, and however it is
done, there is a wonderful
sensation of having been
transported into another era.

While the play is sentimental, it
is not the weepy sentiment of the
afternoon soap opera, but rather
the honest dry sentiment that is
unique to William Saroyan.
Moralistic Play
It is also a comedy, and a play
with a moral, like an Aesop fable.
The moral, like the laughter,
permeates the play and is as clear
as Saroyan's gentle humor.
Saroyan believes, really
believes, that people are good.
Not basicly good, or mostly good,
or any of the other weak modifers
that moral philosophers are fond
of. Saroyan believes that people
are wholly, entirely,
homogeneously and universally,
Good.
It is a remarkable point of view
for the 19 7 o's and I would
venture to say that it was no less
remarkable in 19 39. It is a tribute
to Saroyan that he is able to
convince an audience of 1200
hardened cynics, at least for a
couple of hours, that he may be
right.

The play is set in a waterfront
bar in San Francisco, through
which pass the drop outs of
societyâ€”prostitutes, drunkards,
bums, and those just born
unlucky. Proprietor of this
proletarian Grand Hotel is Nick,
played with warmth by Jim
Baker. Nick is probably the nicest
waterfront dive operator that ever
lived.
His most regular, and
permanent, customer is Joe
sensitivily portrayed by Ken Ruta.
Nick is a plutocrat who prefers to
drink his champagne in Nick's
saloon than at the bar of the St.
Francis.
With only a few exceptions
(and these exceptions are rare for
ACT this year), the acting is first
rate. Mark Wheeler was superb as
Tom, Joe's rather stupid,
kind-hearted friend.
Two-Buck Whore
Joy Carl in was less appealing as
Kitty Duval, the two-buck whore
with the Heart of Gold. Maybe
she just drew a bad set of lines,
but she seemed to have a harder
time than most in keeping the
sentiment dry. She reminded me
of a bad Lorraine Day movie I
once saw on television.
John Hancock and Michael
Cavanaugh play a couple of
down-and-outers who are given
jobs entertaining at Nick's
Hancock's piano playing which
provides most of the background
music for the play, is an effective
backdrop for the more intimate
scenes.
Nasty Villain
Every play has a villain, and
Mr. Saroyan's villain is an evil
therefore as unhuman as can be.
He is a proto- "pig-cop" but in
October 1939 he was obviously
the prototype Nazi.

Blink, as played by Jeff
Chandler, is a thoroughly
despicable character who finds his
chief joy in making people
unhappy. In any other setting
Bliek would be bad enough, but
when surrounded by characters
who are so throughly good he
takes on monstrous proportions,
like a sadist in a nursery.
"The Time of Your Life" is
not a play that will appeal to
everyone. Some of us have drawn
a cynical shell about us that can
have the impenetrability of steel
plate, and such people may not be
moved by what Mr. Saroyan is
trying to do.
But if you're not embarassed
by sentiment, and if you believe
that there is at least a chance that
people aren't totally corrupt, then
you'll probably be very happy
with "The Time of Your Life."
