# Ram's Head One Act Plays Entertain Nitery Audience
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
Voices and applause filtering
through The Nitery walls from the
Old Union rally occassionally
diverted audience attention from
Ram's Head's three Winter
One-Acts and intruded on the
actors' concentration during the
premiere performance. However,
none of the distractions was major
enough to significantly alter the
dramatic and humorous impact of
the evening.
Outside, the Stanford

community was embroiled in
political and tactical discussion.
Inside the theater, a young college
drop-out recoiled from memories
of people and events that had
driven him to seek a cold, isolated
reality, where only a prying
landlady and a neighbor's barking
dog could intrude on his
confusion.
Steve Harvey, the sole actor in
the "Kamicosmic Idiodessy,"
portrays this semi-auto
biographical character created by

Doug Patt, a Stanford
undergraduate.
Monologue Adapts
The monologue is skillfully
adapted to move the scene across
the stage and into the past with
expertise and intensity. Shifts in
speaking style, from
stream-of-consciousness to poetic
prose and straigh forward
statements effect swift changes in
mood and scene, demanding and
receiving an excellent and credible
performance.
"The Great American Desert,"
by Joel Oppenheimer, is a curious
commentary on the often
remanticized post-Civil War
frontier days. The progress of
three outlaws making their
getaway across the Great Plains is
periodically interrupted by
narration from heaven.
Wyatt Earp, Bill the Kid, Doc
Holliday and a dainty Wild Bill
Hickok enlighten the audience
with personal anecdotes and
general rattle concerning the West.
The comments include trivia on
Indian linguistics an explanatory
note on drug addiction amont the
wounded and the reasons for Bill's
frills.
Niterv Atmosphere
Although the Nitery possesses
limited possibilities for developing
atmosphere, this does not
handicap the plays. The troupe,
prefacing their western with the
raising of a plywood sun to the
theme music of "2001 : A Space
Odessy" and employing brooms
for their trusty mounts, makes use
of effective lighting and
particularly adept performances
by Christ Bennion and Adrienne
Moloney.
"Chee-Chee," by Luigi
Pirandello, concerns the petty
exploits and deceptions practiced
by a professional Italian
m.Jdleman, an acquaintance who
is always able to contact
influential people without
exerting influence himself.
Although plausibility is sometimes
strained, the acting is enthusiastic
and entertaining.
The Winter One-Acts will be
performed tonight and Saturday
as well as February 18,19 and 20
at 8 p.m. in the Nitery. General
admission $2.50, students $1.25.
