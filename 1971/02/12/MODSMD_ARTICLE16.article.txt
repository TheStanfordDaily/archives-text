# Swimmers Face USC
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
"We're right where we hoped
we'd be last week. We are very
capable of winning the meet."
Swimming coach Jim Gaughran
thinks his team is ready to take on
their second straight strong
opponent in two weeks when then
face USC at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow.
Last week Stanford had some
problems in the diving and sprint
events when they lost to UCLA
59-54. UCLA placed 1 -2 in the 5 0
yard freestyle and 1-3 in the 100
yard freestyle. And one of
Stanford's two fine divers, Bill
Main, was slowed by the flu.
Gaughran expects a better
showing in these events Saturday.
"The divers will be ready to go.
Main should be at full strength.
The sprinters have been looking
much better in practice, even
better then they did in the UCLA
meet."
The sprints will be a crucial
part of the meets. USC's stf-ongest
swimmer, Frank Heckl, will
probably see action in both the 5 0
and 100 yard freestyle events, as
well as the individual medley and
the freestyle relay.
Another fine performer for the
Trojans is distanceman Tom
Mcßreen, who will probably
double in the 500 and 1 000 yard
freestyles. Mcßreen will face a
strong challenge from Stanford's
Brent Berk who set a new
Stanford record in the 1000 last
weekend.
In last year's NCAA
Championships, the Trojans
finished second ahead of
Stanford.

Stanford squeaked by the Trojans
59-54. And Berk was one of the
big heroes of that win. He won
the 1000 yard freestyle in one of
the big victories of the day. In
another big win, the diving team
of Main and Ted Nichols went 1 -2
in both diving events.

If these performers come
through well tomorrow, the
Indians have a fine shot at
winning. The meet will be held in
the limited capacity Stanford
pool, so you should get there
early. Last weekend, a capacity
crowd viewed the UCLA meet.

double in the 500 and 1 000 yard
freestyles. Mcßreen will face a
strong challenge from Stanford's
Brent Berk who set a new
Stanford record in the 1000 last
weekend.
In last year's NCAA
Championships, the Trojans
finished second ahead of
Stanford.

Stanford squeaked by the Trojans
59-54. And Berk was one of the
big heroes of that win. He won
the 1000 yard freestyle in one of
the big victories of the day. In
another big win, the diving team
of Main and Ted Nichols went 1 -2
in both diving events.

If these performers come
through well tomorrow, the
Indians have a fine shot at
winning. The meet will be held in
the limited capacity Stanford
pool, so you should get there
early. Last weekend, a capacity
crowd viewed the UCLA meet.
