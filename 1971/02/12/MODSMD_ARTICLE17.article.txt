"We're going up against the
best," said Stanford wrestling
coach Dave Reed before
Wednesday, night's match atainst
Oregon State. The match should
be an indicator of how we'll do in
the Pac-8 Tournament."
Perhaps Oregon State did
provide a few indications of things
to come to the tournament, as it
downed Stanford 38-6, even
though three wrestlers, each
ranked in the top five of their
weight nationally, had to be left
at home in Corvallis due of
injuries. OSU still won six pins
and one decision.
Stanford's first points came
when Dave Thomas decisioned
OSU's Dan Elliott, 1-0 at 142 lbs.
Thomas got the point through an
escape in the second period. He's
the son of OSU's wrestling coach
Dale Thomas, who stood off in a
corner instead of yelling for
Elliot.
"When my son is wrestling the
man, I let the match go," said
Coach Thomas. Other times
Coach Thomas colmly called out
instructions to his men on the
mat. "I don't just yell to give
them encouragement, I expect
them to do it."
The rest of Stanford's points

came when 15 0 -pounder Chris
Horpel decisioned OSU's Rob
Brown, 6-4. Horpel got the first
take down, with Brown soon
escaping. So it went for the rest of
the match, with no near-pins or
predicaments.
OSU's 167 pounder Ken
Thomas, (another son of Coach
Thomas!) decisioned Stanford's
Bob Schoultz.
