# Tribe Still After First League Win
## 
### 
Still looking for their fifth
victory of the season, the
Stanford basketball team will try
to put an end to their eight-game
losing streak this weekend, when
they host the Washington Huskies
Friday night and the Washington
State Cougars Saturday night.
Despite Coach Howie Dallmar's
recent misfortunes, he remains
optimistic. For the first time this
season, all his players including
6-10 center Larry Rosenzweig,
will be available for action.
Washington will present the
usual problem for the Cards. The
Huskies' front line includes 6-10
Steve Hawes and 6-10 Mike Fink,
both strong inside threats. Hawes
leads the Pac-8 in rebounding with
15 a game, and is third in scoring
with a 22.0 average.
Washington State is "a far
better team than their record
indicates," according to Dallmar.
They only have a 1-4 league
record, but they are 10-2 in
non-conference. They have two

fine forwards in Dennis Hogg and
Jim Meredith.
Hogg is an excellent defensive
player. He limited Claude Terry to
10 points in a Far West Classic
game won by the Cougars 65-55
earlier this season.
Tip-off time for both games if
8:00 p.m., preceded by Frosh
games at 6 :00 p.m. The freshmen
game against San Jose State
Saturday night, will give the
Papooses a chance to avenge their
only loss of the year.
