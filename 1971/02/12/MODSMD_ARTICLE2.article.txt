# Protests Remain Peaceful
## 
### FRED MANN 
War protest reverted to peaceful
means yesterday afternoon as 2 00
people, the vast majority of them high
school students, marched through the
Stanford Industrial Park and then
returned to Hoover Tower to stage a
brief rally on the front steps of the
building. There were no incidents.
A meeting last night in the Old
Union courtyard drew only about 150
people and broke up within a half an
hour. The group decided to split into
small affinity groups to go into the
dorms to talk to people and to play
"tag" with the police.
Led predominantly by Gunn High
School students, participating in a
proclaimed 112 "High School
Mobilization," the marchers moved
from a noon rally at White Plaza, down
Escondido Road to Hanover St., and
Page Mill Road, passing sun bathers
outside Branner Hall and delaying
traffic behind them.
A dozen young marchers ran
through sprinklers in front of Ginn and
Co. in the industrial park, enjoying the
80 -degree heat.
The marchers chanted anti-war
slogans and headed west on Page Mill to
Hewlett-Packard, a main target of
protests in the past.
Back To Hoover
At Peter Coutts Road, the marchers
turned around and retraced their steps
past scattered spectators gazing from
office windows.
One rock was thrown at a Palo Alto
police car but missed.
By the time the march turned
toward the Hoover Institute, the crowd
had dwindled to less than 120, but
grew when the group stopped at the
steps of the tower.
Doors to the tower and annex were
locked, and at least five Santa Clara
County police officers in full riot gear
were seen inside the annex.
The Afternoon's events started from
the White Plaza rally where students
and community people discussed the

shootings of .the night before, and
tactics for further protest against the
invasion of Laos.
Critics of the violence denounced
the tactics of the revolutionaries and
won applause from less than half the
700 people gathered.
In reply to one of the critics, Yale
Braunstein told the generally apathetic
audience, "There is a war going on in
the world, and the poeple causing that
war are at fault no matter who pulls the
trigger. If I find a pig with a camera,
too chicken to carry a gun, I wouldn't
be too surprised if he got hurt."
Referring to the attack on three
Free Campus Movement members
Wednesday night, Lenny Siegel of the
New Left Project said, "I don't mind
taking a camera from an FCM guy, and
I don't mind beating him. But I think
you go too far when you beat him
when he's unconscious."
Demands By FCM
Pearlier in the morning, members of
the FCM met with President Lyman to
demand protection from the University
and law enforcement agencies against
attack. They also protested what they
claimed was a long delay before police
arrived to assist them in their battle
with radicals in White Plaza.
The group placed two .45 calibre
pistol bullets on Lyman's desk,
symbolizing the two persons shot that
night.
Last night, at least 50 patrol cars
and numerous walking units of six
policemen each covered the campus.
Several groups of protestors wandered
around, trying to bother police and
keep them occupied.
In contrast to the night before, last
night's biggest events included a small
fire in a dempster-dumpster behind the
bookstore, a small set fire near the
shack at the Stanford driving range, and
a motorcycle accident at Florence
Moore Hall which attracted countless
spectators and riot police.
Also last night, about 100 people
gathered for a community meeting at

Addison School in Palo Alto and voted
almost unanimously to leaflet and
picket in the Pacific Telephone building
on University Ave. on Saturday.
The group also voted to conduct a
similar campaign at the
Hewlett-Packard facility on Tuesday.
A broad-cross-section of the
community was represented at the
meeting, including Free University
members, high school students, parents,
and people wearing Venceremos
buttons.
Another White Plaza rally has been
called for noon today.

Last night, at least 50 patrol cars
and numerous walking units of six
policemen each covered the campus.
Several groups of protestors wandered
around, trying to bother police and
keep them occupied.
In contrast to the night before, last
night's biggest events included a small
fire in a dempster-dumpster behind the
bookstore, a small set fire near the
shack at the Stanford driving range, and
a motorcycle accident at Florence
Moore Hall which attracted countless
spectators and riot police.
Also last night, about 100 people
gathered for a community meeting at

Addison School in Palo Alto and voted
almost unanimously to leaflet and
picket in the Pacific Telephone building
on University Ave. on Saturday.
The group also voted to conduct a
similar campaign at the
Hewlett-Packard facility on Tuesday.
A broad-cross-section of the
community was represented at the
meeting, including Free University
members, high school students, parents,
and people wearing Venceremos
buttons.
Another White Plaza rally has been
called for noon today.
War protest reverted to peaceful
means yesterday afternoon as 2 00
people, the vast majority of them high
school students, marched through the
Stanford Industrial Park and then
returned to Hoover Tower to stage a
brief rally on the front steps of the
building. There were no incidents.
A meeting last night in the Old
Union courtyard drew only about 150
people and broke up within a half an
hour. The group decided to split into
small affinity groups to go into the
dorms to talk to people and to play
"tag" with the police.
Led predominantly by Gunn High
School students, participating in a
proclaimed 112 "High School
Mobilization," the marchers moved
from a noon rally at White Plaza, down
Escondido Road to Hanover St., and
Page Mill Road, passing sun bathers
outside Branner Hall and delaying
traffic behind them.
A dozen young marchers ran
through sprinklers in front of Ginn and
Co. in the industrial park, enjoying the
80 -degree heat.
The marchers chanted anti-war
slogans and headed west on Page Mill to
Hewlett-Packard, a main target of
protests in the past.
Back To Hoover
At Peter Coutts Road, the marchers
turned around and retraced their steps
past scattered spectators gazing from
office windows.
One rock was thrown at a Palo Alto
police car but missed.
By the time the march turned
toward the Hoover Institute, the crowd
had dwindled to less than 120, but
grew when the group stopped at the
steps of the tower.
Doors to the tower and annex were
locked, and at least five Santa Clara
County police officers in full riot gear
were seen inside the annex.
The Afternoon's events started from
the White Plaza rally where students
and community people discussed the

shootings of .the night before, and
tactics for further protest against the
invasion of Laos.
Critics of the violence denounced
the tactics of the revolutionaries and
won applause from less than half the
700 people gathered.
In reply to one of the critics, Yale
Braunstein told the generally apathetic
audience, "There is a war going on in
the world, and the poeple causing that
war are at fault no matter who pulls the
trigger. If I find a pig with a camera,
too chicken to carry a gun, I wouldn't
be too surprised if he got hurt."
Referring to the attack on three
Free Campus Movement members
Wednesday night, Lenny Siegel of the
New Left Project said, "I don't mind
taking a camera from an FCM guy, and
I don't mind beating him. But I think
you go too far when you beat him
when he's unconscious."
Demands By FCM
Pearlier in the morning, members of
the FCM met with President Lyman to
demand protection from the University
and law enforcement agencies against
attack. They also protested what they
claimed was a long delay before police
arrived to assist them in their battle
with radicals in White Plaza.
The group placed two .45 calibre
pistol bullets on Lyman's desk,
symbolizing the two persons shot that
night.
Last night, at least 50 patrol cars
and numerous walking units of six
policemen each covered the campus.
