Atkins Confession
LOS ANGELES — Susan Atkins said Thursday she stabbed
a Malibu musician to death after starting to sew up with
dental floss an ear Charles Manson had almost severed with
a sword.
"I didn't want to kill him," she testified in a dreamy
whisper at the Sharon Tate murder trial. "I wanted to talk
to him . . . but he had shot into my love . . . into Charlie."
Miss Atkins, 22, in her third day on the stand at the
Sharon Tate murder trial, discussed under
cross-examination the slaying of musician Gary Hinman. It
is not directly related to the Tate case, but she confessed to
it in earlier testimony.
She said several members of Manson's hippie-style
family were at the home of the 34 year-old Hinman,
discussing Manson's demand that Hinman turn over to the
clan his car and some money.
Hinman, she said, suddenly fired a shot at Manson,
missing. Manson slashed Hinman's ear with a sword he
carried and fled, then when Hinman started to give chase
she stabbed him with a hunting knife she carried, Miss
Atkins said.
Nuclear Weapons Ban
WASHINGTON — Ceremonies yesterday involving more
than 60 nations marked the signing of the newest
disarmament pact of the Atomic Age: a treaty banning
nuclear weapons from the world's seabeds.
President Nixon was scheduled as the main speaker at
singing ceremonies at the State Department.
Earlier in the day, in Moscow, the treaty was signed by
the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union and
Premier Alexei N. Kosygin said he feels a sense of
satisfaction that the pact was agreed upon and signed.
Heavy Cambodian Fighting
SAIGON — South Vietnamese headquarters reported heavy
action in eastern Cambodia, about 300 miles to the south
of the drive into Laos.
Headquarters said South Vietnamese forces killed 164
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong in six engagements
mostly along Highways 1 and 7, and including an enemy
ambush of a South Vietnamese convoy moving along the
Mekong River.
South Vietnamese officers said Thursday, the heavy
fighting in southern Laos is yet to come. It may come soon.
Field commanders reported they expect major
engagements in the valleys around Sepone, where sizable

contingents of North Vietnamese regulars are believed
deployed.
South Vietnamese troops reached Sepone Wednesday in
the deepest penetration so far of the westward drive into
Laos, now in its fourth day.
The crossroads town, deserted and heavily bombed by
air strikes, is 25 miles west of the Vietnamese border. It
was a major supply depot and transshipment point for the
North Vietnamese on the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Quake Death Rises
LOS ANGELES — Deaths from Southern California's
shattering earthquake appeared likely to rise above 60
yesterday and damage was estimated unofficially at $1
billion or more.
Thousands of persons whose homes were harmed by
Tuesday's tremor or who were evacuated from the area of a
leaking reservoir dam either camped out in the
unseasonably warm weath3r or stayed at Red Cross centers
in schools.
The total of known dead reached 58. Thirty-five bodies
had been found in the ruins of collapsed buildings at a
veterans hospital, where three patients and five nurses still
were missing and feared dead.
The earthquake may have speeded up nature's time
clock for an inevitable great quake somewhere along
California's restless, 700 mile-long San Andreas fault, a top
federal seismic expert said yesterday.
Pesticide Tests Hit
WASHINGTON — Two pesticide manufacturers hired
farm workers to act as guinea pigs for experiments with
poisonous chemicals, a nonprofit group studying the
agriculture business industry said Wednesday.
Some of the 4 9 farm laborers tested, including women
and children, suffered serious medical effects, the public
interest group said.
The Agribusiness Accountability Project released
information it said came from experiments by Niagara
Chemical Co. of Middleport, N.Y., and Chemagro Corp. of
Kansas City.
It announced plans to file a petition with the
Environmental Protection Agency asking for an
emergency order prohibiting pesticide experiments on
human beings.
A Chemagro Corp. spokesman said, "The test was
under complete medical supervision at all times but no
illness resulted. In fact, the conditions were not unlike
normal worker conditions . .

Pesticide Tests Hit
WASHINGTON — Two pesticide manufacturers hired
farm workers to act as guinea pigs for experiments with
poisonous chemicals, a nonprofit group studying the
agriculture business industry said Wednesday.
Some of the 4 9 farm laborers tested, including women
and children, suffered serious medical effects, the public
interest group said.
The Agribusiness Accountability Project released
information it said came from experiments by Niagara
Chemical Co. of Middleport, N.Y., and Chemagro Corp. of
Kansas City.
It announced plans to file a petition with the
Environmental Protection Agency asking for an
emergency order prohibiting pesticide experiments on
human beings.
A Chemagro Corp. spokesman said, "The test was
under complete medical supervision at all times but no
illness resulted. In fact, the conditions were not unlike
normal worker conditions . .

Atkins Confession
LOS ANGELES — Susan Atkins said Thursday she stabbed
a Malibu musician to death after starting to sew up with
dental floss an ear Charles Manson had almost severed with
a sword.
"I didn't want to kill him," she testified in a dreamy
whisper at the Sharon Tate murder trial. "I wanted to talk
to him . . . but he had shot into my love . . . into Charlie."
Miss Atkins, 22, in her third day on the stand at the
Sharon Tate murder trial, discussed under
cross-examination the slaying of musician Gary Hinman. It
is not directly related to the Tate case, but she confessed to
it in earlier testimony.
She said several members of Manson's hippie-style
family were at the home of the 34 year-old Hinman,
discussing Manson's demand that Hinman turn over to the
clan his car and some money.
Hinman, she said, suddenly fired a shot at Manson,
missing. Manson slashed Hinman's ear with a sword he
carried and fled, then when Hinman started to give chase
she stabbed him with a hunting knife she carried, Miss
Atkins said.
Nuclear Weapons Ban
WASHINGTON — Ceremonies yesterday involving more
than 60 nations marked the signing of the newest
disarmament pact of the Atomic Age: a treaty banning
nuclear weapons from the world's seabeds.
President Nixon was scheduled as the main speaker at
singing ceremonies at the State Department.
Earlier in the day, in Moscow, the treaty was signed by
the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union and
Premier Alexei N. Kosygin said he feels a sense of
satisfaction that the pact was agreed upon and signed.
Heavy Cambodian Fighting
SAIGON — South Vietnamese headquarters reported heavy
action in eastern Cambodia, about 300 miles to the south
of the drive into Laos.
Headquarters said South Vietnamese forces killed 164
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong in six engagements
mostly along Highways 1 and 7, and including an enemy
ambush of a South Vietnamese convoy moving along the
Mekong River.
South Vietnamese officers said Thursday, the heavy
fighting in southern Laos is yet to come. It may come soon.
Field commanders reported they expect major
engagements in the valleys around Sepone, where sizable

contingents of North Vietnamese regulars are believed
deployed.
South Vietnamese troops reached Sepone Wednesday in
the deepest penetration so far of the westward drive into
Laos, now in its fourth day.
The crossroads town, deserted and heavily bombed by
air strikes, is 25 miles west of the Vietnamese border. It
was a major supply depot and transshipment point for the
North Vietnamese on the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Quake Death Rises
LOS ANGELES — Deaths from Southern California's
shattering earthquake appeared likely to rise above 60
yesterday and damage was estimated unofficially at $1
billion or more.
Thousands of persons whose homes were harmed by
Tuesday's tremor or who were evacuated from the area of a
leaking reservoir dam either camped out in the
unseasonably warm weath3r or stayed at Red Cross centers
in schools.
The total of known dead reached 58. Thirty-five bodies
had been found in the ruins of collapsed buildings at a
veterans hospital, where three patients and five nurses still
were missing and feared dead.
The earthquake may have speeded up nature's time
clock for an inevitable great quake somewhere along
California's restless, 700 mile-long San Andreas fault, a top
federal seismic expert said yesterday.
