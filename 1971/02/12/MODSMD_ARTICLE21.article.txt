# Budget Cuts Hit SLAC
## 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
Cuts in federal spending will force
SLAC to apply increased financial
restraints in the form of reduced
employment, partial salary increase
deferral, and reduced work weeks,
according to W.K. H. Panofsky, SLAC
head.
In a speech given before SLAC
employees Tuesday, Panofsky stated
that in the past, budget squeezes have
been met by decreasing "outside
costs." Yet Panofsky added that "the
apparent magnitude of our coming
budget problem is such that we cannot
continue to absorb it all by such
techniques without seriously affecting
the quality of our work."
Panofsky then set forth a three
point plan which he hopes will permit
SLAC to reduce costs without reducing
research and personnel. First, he
suggested that those employees in the
higher pay brackets who would
normally be granted salary increases
have the effective date of their pay
raises delayed. Staff Members, Senior
Research Associates, Faculty and
Directors will begin to receive their
increased salaries six months after their
regular effective dates. Staff Associates
would receive their increased salaries
three months after their regular
effective dates. Increases for all other
employees will not be deferred.
Secondly, Panofsky stated that the
SLAC payroll will have to be reduced
by approximately 4 0. He added that he
hopes that this could be effected by
simply not filling those jobs that
become vacant through voluntary

departure of some employees. "We
hope that the number of involuntary
separations will be very small indeed."
The third point on Panofsky's plan
called for a shortened work week where
employees would work a four day week
once a month with their "extra day"
being a vacation without pay.
Panofsky said that he plans to
continue the shortened work week for
at least six months starting in July, but
that the duration "may be shorter or
longer."
Panofsky told the assembled
employees that he felt that this option
was much better than following
"common industrial practice" of
separating "close to 100 people from
the payroll." He asserted that i f such a
policy were followed, "the quality of
our work would suffer. We could shut
the laboratory down for enough weeks
without pay to balance the budget, but
we would thereby seriously diminish
the scope of our research program."
Another possibility cited would be
to freeze all salary increases for an
entire year,, but Panofsky felt that this
"would be unfair to everyone in this
time of inflation, and we could not
reward excellence of work."
In prefacing his speech, Panofsky
lauded the "excellent results" that have
been obtained "both instrumentally
and scientifically" in spite of last year's
"budget pressures." He stated that
SLAC exists "for the purpose of
designing, supporting and carrying out
new experiments in elementary particle
physics and to develop interpretation
and theories relating to sucH work.

hope that the number of involuntary
separations will be very small indeed."
The third point on Panofsky's plan
called for a shortened work week where
employees would work a four day week
once a month with their "extra day"
being a vacation without pay.
Panofsky said that he plans to
continue the shortened work week for
at least six months starting in July, but
that the duration "may be shorter or
longer."
Panofsky told the assembled
employees that he felt that this option
was much better than following
"common industrial practice" of
separating "close to 100 people from
the payroll." He asserted that i f such a
policy were followed, "the quality of
our work would suffer. We could shut
the laboratory down for enough weeks
without pay to balance the budget, but
we would thereby seriously diminish
the scope of our research program."
Another possibility cited would be
to freeze all salary increases for an
entire year,, but Panofsky felt that this
"would be unfair to everyone in this
time of inflation, and we could not
reward excellence of work."
In prefacing his speech, Panofsky
lauded the "excellent results" that have
been obtained "both instrumentally
and scientifically" in spite of last year's
"budget pressures." He stated that
SLAC exists "for the purpose of
designing, supporting and carrying out
new experiments in elementary particle
physics and to develop interpretation
and theories relating to sucH work.
Cuts in federal spending will force
SLAC to apply increased financial
restraints in the form of reduced
employment, partial salary increase
deferral, and reduced work weeks,
according to W.K. H. Panofsky, SLAC
head.
In a speech given before SLAC
employees Tuesday, Panofsky stated
that in the past, budget squeezes have
been met by decreasing "outside
costs." Yet Panofsky added that "the
apparent magnitude of our coming
budget problem is such that we cannot
continue to absorb it all by such
techniques without seriously affecting
the quality of our work."
Panofsky then set forth a three
point plan which he hopes will permit
SLAC to reduce costs without reducing
research and personnel. First, he
suggested that those employees in the
higher pay brackets who would
normally be granted salary increases
have the effective date of their pay
raises delayed. Staff Members, Senior
Research Associates, Faculty and
Directors will begin to receive their
increased salaries six months after their
regular effective dates. Staff Associates
would receive their increased salaries
three months after their regular
effective dates. Increases for all other
employees will not be deferred.
Secondly, Panofsky stated that the
SLAC payroll will have to be reduced
by approximately 4 0. He added that he
hopes that this could be effected by
simply not filling those jobs that
become vacant through voluntary

departure of some employees. "We
hope that the number of involuntary
separations will be very small indeed."
