# ABC Spots American Soldiers Inside Laos
## 
### 
(AP) — ABC Radio reported Thursday
that a dead American soldier wearing a
South Vietnamese uniform had been
evacuated from inside Laos.
Both ABC and CBS radio networks
carried reports that American ground
troops were taking part in the invasion,
some in South Vietnamese uniforms.
In Washington, Pentagon spokesmen
continued to deny that any American
ground combat troops are involved.
White House press secretary Roland
L. Ziegler said that "our policy is and
will continue to be that there will be no
U.S. combat troops or advisers in
Laos."
ABC newsman Howard Tuckner
reported he had seen what appeared to
be an American bathing with two
South Vietnamese soldiers 25 miles
inside Laos. South Vietnamese riding
with Tuckner said the man was a "GI
adviser."
"When we tried to jump off the
vehicle to speak to him, he ran off into
the bush," Tuckner reported.
He said that soon an American

helicopter came in to pick up some
American bodies. He said the pilot,
who was on the ground for 30 minutes,
told him he was waiting to pick up the
Dodies of four helicopter crewmen who
were shot down.
