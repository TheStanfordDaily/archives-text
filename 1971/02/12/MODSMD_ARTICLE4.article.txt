# Reagan Veto Threatening CRLA Existance
## 
### CHRIS YUEN TOM FRICKE 
"Ever see a hog when they try to
castrate him? He squeals and kicks and
won't hold still. Well, we're doing more
than squealing and kicking," said
Antonio Del Buono, senior community
worker at the Gilroy office of the
embattled California Rural Legal
Assistance (CRLA). In the next six
months, CRLA personnel believe, the
organization's potency in dealing with
the legal problems of the poor, as well
as its existence, will be severely
challenged.
CRLA's current crisis began
December 26, when Governor Reagan
vetoed a $U8 million federal grant
needed to finance the program. Federal
Office of Economic Opportunity
Acting Director Frank Carlucci could
have overriden the veto, but instead
chose to grant emergency funds to keep
CRLA functioning for six months. In
the meantime, a commission will be
appointed by Carlucci to investigate
charges made by state OEO director
Ix'wis K. Uhler in a critical 283-page
report. The commission's findings, if
critical of CRLA, could result in the
end of CRLA funding or the
continuation of the program under
severe restrictions.
Uhler, a former member of the John
Birch Society, was appointed to his
post by Reagan last fall. The Uhler

report charges that "the essence of
CRLA's direction is to wage ideological
warfare, with the poor as ammunition.
Their effect has been to stir dissent,
fear, and division in the communities
they are supposed to serve."
The strife between Reagan and
CRLA dates back almost to the
inception of the organization in 1966.
In 1 967 , CRLA won a major lawsuit
which forced Reagan to restore millions
of dollars which he had slashed from
the Medi-Cal program. In the four years
since its beginning, CRLA lawyers have
argued 70,0 00 cases and won 86
percent of them.
"We've been too effective—that's
what doesn't like," claims Del
Buono, a 70-year old veteran of welfare
battles. "Reagan is really irritated by
CRLA supporting people diametrically
opposed to his pals and cronys,'' says
Steve Fleischer, one of the four
attorneys who work out of the
informal (lilroy office. It is one of
eleven scattered throughout the state,
staffed by forty lawyers. In addition to
winning suits against government
agencies, CRLA has antagonized
powerful interest groups, including
growers. "We make l.hem give workers
the legal wage, proper sanitation, and
clean drinking water. This increases
their costs."
To Fleischer, the major role of the
(lilroy office is to act as ombudsmen
for the rural poor, to negotiate with

local officials, and to deal with their
other legal needs. In recent months, the
Gilroy office has attempted to stop a
grower from refusing to allow visitors
to farm laborers who live in shacks he
owns. In one of their more important
cases they managed to overturn a
provision requiring English literacy for
voting in California, a victory which
enfranchised thousands of Chicano
citizens.
A sampling of the Uhler report
reveals the strongly political nature of
the charges: "it has become crystal
clear that the political and emotional
bent of far too many CRLA attorneys
traverses the far left extremity of the
socio-political spectrum." It goes on to
claim that the organization is filled
with "true believers, hitchhiking a ride
at the expense of the rural poor to
achieve dislocation of our social,
political, and economic order."
A direct charge is that CKLA goes
out of its way to raise issues, while it
turns away small claims cases. Several
regional offices admit they do not have
the manpower to help every client who
comes to them. For instance, they
frequently refer divorce cases to other
lawyers. Stanford law student Elaine
Climpson, who has worked for the
central office in San Francisco,
explains, "By not helping every person
who comes in, CIJLA probably helps
more people than it would if it tried to
help everybody who came."

A large section of the report
attempts to connect CRLA attorneys
with the Soledad Brothers, black
inmates at Soledad prison who are
accused of murdering a white prison
guard. Former Stanford law student,
Louis Jaramillo, a CRLA research
assistant at the Salinas office, is
mentioned twice in the Uhler report for
visiting prisoners at Soledad. He admits
that he did indeed visit prisoners at
Soledad—hut at their request. There is
no regulation against CRLA personnel
visiting prisoners under such
circumstances.
A lengthy section of the report
details the activities of Oakland lawyer
Kaye Stender, who is not even
employed by CRLA. After linking her
with the Angela Davis case, the report
goes on to say that "Investigation has
shown that the relationship between
CRLA and Faye Stender is close." The
use of this kind of evidence has led
defenders of CRLA to complain that
the Uhler report employs
guilt-by-association tactics. Steve
Fleischer calls the report "Totally
political and totally cynical. It's a web
of lies."
A persistent claim in the report is
that CRLA is a radical organization.
Replies Klaine Clinipson, "Sure, they're
a little unorthodox in their approach,
and some of their people are pretty
radical, but I don't think CRLA itself is
radical. The best proof of that is that
the courts have consistently upheld
CRLA." Del Buono says "Anything
done to deprive the poor of their equal
rights hastens revolution. CRLA is just
trying to get the poor their equal
rights."

CRLA has gained considerable
support from other legal associations.
The American Bar Association and the
National Bar Association have rated
CRLA as the outstanding legal service
program in the country. CRLA people
are apprehensive about getting a fair
hearing before Carlucci's committee,
and are trying to get fair, open

hearings. The issue is squarely placed to
the Reagan administration: will it
support legaj representation to poor
people, Mexican-Americans, and other
minorities?
In place of CRLA, the Reagan
administration proposes an
"adjudi-care" system to be operated by
local bar associations. "Do you know
what happens when a poor person goes
to a place like that?" asks Del Buono.
"He walks in and talks to a
receptionist. She's usually the type who
asks you where you were born and
why! Poor people get extremely
frightened in these situations, and they
never come back."
The conflict between CRLA and
Reagan is largely philosophical. Reagan
has charged that CRLA is not meeting
the needs of the poor. "Reagan thinks
that the needs of the poor are to have
the symptoms of poverty dealt with,
like bankruptcy and divorce. Our
purpose is to attack the fundamental
causes of poverty. This is what the
original grant of the OEO says is its
main goal," says Attorney Fleischer.
Ed Hayes, a Stanford law student
who worked for CRLA last year
comments, "I think what Reagan
meant is that CRLA is not meeting the
desires of the rich, and is meeting the
needs of the poor."

traverses the far left extremity of the
socio-political spectrum." It goes on to
claim that the organization is filled
with "true believers, hitchhiking a ride
at the expense of the rural poor to
achieve dislocation of our social,
political, and economic order."
A direct charge is that CKLA goes
out of its way to raise issues, while it
turns away small claims cases. Several
regional offices admit they do not have
the manpower to help every client who
comes to them. For instance, they
frequently refer divorce cases to other
lawyers. Stanford law student Elaine
Climpson, who has worked for the
central office in San Francisco,
explains, "By not helping every person
who comes in, CIJLA probably helps
more people than it would if it tried to
help everybody who came."

A large section of the report
attempts to connect CRLA attorneys
with the Soledad Brothers, black
inmates at Soledad prison who are
accused of murdering a white prison
guard. Former Stanford law student,
Louis Jaramillo, a CRLA research
assistant at the Salinas office, is
mentioned twice in the Uhler report for
visiting prisoners at Soledad. He admits
that he did indeed visit prisoners at
Soledad—hut at their request. There is
no regulation against CRLA personnel
visiting prisoners under such
circumstances.
A lengthy section of the report
details the activities of Oakland lawyer
Kaye Stender, who is not even
employed by CRLA. After linking her
with the Angela Davis case, the report
goes on to say that "Investigation has
shown that the relationship between
CRLA and Faye Stender is close." The
use of this kind of evidence has led
defenders of CRLA to complain that
the Uhler report employs
guilt-by-association tactics. Steve
Fleischer calls the report "Totally
political and totally cynical. It's a web
of lies."
A persistent claim in the report is
that CRLA is a radical organization.
Replies Klaine Clinipson, "Sure, they're
a little unorthodox in their approach,
and some of their people are pretty
radical, but I don't think CRLA itself is
radical. The best proof of that is that
the courts have consistently upheld
CRLA." Del Buono says "Anything
done to deprive the poor of their equal
rights hastens revolution. CRLA is just
trying to get the poor their equal
rights."

CRLA has gained considerable
support from other legal associations.
The American Bar Association and the
National Bar Association have rated
CRLA as the outstanding legal service
program in the country. CRLA people
are apprehensive about getting a fair
hearing before Carlucci's committee,
and are trying to get fair, open

hearings. The issue is squarely placed to
the Reagan administration: will it
support legaj representation to poor
people, Mexican-Americans, and other
minorities?
In place of CRLA, the Reagan
administration proposes an
"adjudi-care" system to be operated by
local bar associations. "Do you know
what happens when a poor person goes
to a place like that?" asks Del Buono.
"He walks in and talks to a
receptionist. She's usually the type who
asks you where you were born and
why! Poor people get extremely
frightened in these situations, and they
never come back."
The conflict between CRLA and
Reagan is largely philosophical. Reagan
has charged that CRLA is not meeting
the needs of the poor. "Reagan thinks
that the needs of the poor are to have
the symptoms of poverty dealt with,
like bankruptcy and divorce. Our
purpose is to attack the fundamental
causes of poverty. This is what the
original grant of the OEO says is its
main goal," says Attorney Fleischer.
Ed Hayes, a Stanford law student
who worked for CRLA last year
comments, "I think what Reagan
meant is that CRLA is not meeting the
desires of the rich, and is meeting the
needs of the poor."
"Ever see a hog when they try to
castrate him? He squeals and kicks and
won't hold still. Well, we're doing more
than squealing and kicking," said
Antonio Del Buono, senior community
worker at the Gilroy office of the
embattled California Rural Legal
Assistance (CRLA). In the next six
months, CRLA personnel believe, the
organization's potency in dealing with
the legal problems of the poor, as well
as its existence, will be severely
challenged.
CRLA's current crisis began
December 26, when Governor Reagan
vetoed a $U8 million federal grant
needed to finance the program. Federal
Office of Economic Opportunity
Acting Director Frank Carlucci could
have overriden the veto, but instead
chose to grant emergency funds to keep
CRLA functioning for six months. In
the meantime, a commission will be
appointed by Carlucci to investigate
charges made by state OEO director
Ix'wis K. Uhler in a critical 283-page
report. The commission's findings, if
critical of CRLA, could result in the
end of CRLA funding or the
continuation of the program under
severe restrictions.
Uhler, a former member of the John
Birch Society, was appointed to his
post by Reagan last fall. The Uhler

report charges that "the essence of
CRLA's direction is to wage ideological
warfare, with the poor as ammunition.
Their effect has been to stir dissent,
fear, and division in the communities
they are supposed to serve."
The strife between Reagan and
CRLA dates back almost to the
inception of the organization in 1966.
In 1 967 , CRLA won a major lawsuit
which forced Reagan to restore millions
of dollars which he had slashed from
the Medi-Cal program. In the four years
since its beginning, CRLA lawyers have
argued 70,0 00 cases and won 86
percent of them.
"We've been too effective—that's
what doesn't like," claims Del
Buono, a 70-year old veteran of welfare
battles. "Reagan is really irritated by
CRLA supporting people diametrically
opposed to his pals and cronys,'' says
Steve Fleischer, one of the four
attorneys who work out of the
informal (lilroy office. It is one of
eleven scattered throughout the state,
staffed by forty lawyers. In addition to
winning suits against government
agencies, CRLA has antagonized
powerful interest groups, including
growers. "We make l.hem give workers
the legal wage, proper sanitation, and
clean drinking water. This increases
their costs."
To Fleischer, the major role of the
(lilroy office is to act as ombudsmen
for the rural poor, to negotiate with

local officials, and to deal with their
other legal needs. In recent months, the
Gilroy office has attempted to stop a
grower from refusing to allow visitors
to farm laborers who live in shacks he
owns. In one of their more important
cases they managed to overturn a
provision requiring English literacy for
voting in California, a victory which
enfranchised thousands of Chicano
citizens.
A sampling of the Uhler report
reveals the strongly political nature of
the charges: "it has become crystal
clear that the political and emotional
bent of far too many CRLA attorneys
traverses the far left extremity of the
socio-political spectrum." It goes on to
claim that the organization is filled
with "true believers, hitchhiking a ride

the needs of the poor. "Reagan thinks
that the needs of the poor are to have
the symptoms of poverty dealt with,
like bankruptcy and divorce. Our
purpose is to attack the fundamental
causes of poverty. This is what the
original grant of the OEO says is its
main goal," says Attorney Fleischer.
Ed Hayes, a Stanford law student
who worked for CRLA last year
comments, "I think what Reagan
meant is that CRLA is not meeting the
desires of the rich, and is meeting the
needs of the poor."
"Ever see a hog when they try to
castrate him? He squeals and kicks and
won't hold still. Well, we're doing more
than squealing and kicking," said
Antonio Del Buono, senior community
worker at the Gilroy office of the
embattled California Rural Legal
Assistance (CRLA). In the next six
months, CRLA personnel believe, the
organization's potency in dealing with
the legal problems of the poor, as well
as its existence, will be severely
challenged.
CRLA's current crisis began
December 26, when Governor Reagan
vetoed a $U8 million federal grant
needed to finance the program. Federal
Office of Economic Opportunity
Acting Director Frank Carlucci could
have overriden the veto, but instead
chose to grant emergency funds to keep
CRLA functioning for six months. In
the meantime, a commission will be
appointed by Carlucci to investigate
charges made by state OEO director
Ix'wis K. Uhler in a critical 283-page
report. The commission's findings, if
critical of CRLA, could result in the
end of CRLA funding or the
continuation of the program under
severe restrictions.
Uhler, a former member of the John
Birch Society, was appointed to his
post by Reagan last fall. The Uhler

report charges that "the essence of
CRLA's direction is to wage ideological
warfare, with the poor as ammunition.
Their effect has been to stir dissent,
fear, and division in the communities
they are supposed to serve."
The strife between Reagan and
CRLA dates back almost to the
inception of the organization in 1966.
In 1 967 , CRLA won a major lawsuit
which forced Reagan to restore millions
of dollars which he had slashed from
the Medi-Cal program. In the four years
since its beginning, CRLA lawyers have
argued 70,0 00 cases and won 86
percent of them.
"We've been too effective—that's
what doesn't like," claims Del
Buono, a 70-year old veteran of welfare
battles. "Reagan is really irritated by
CRLA supporting people diametrically
opposed to his pals and cronys,'' says
Steve Fleischer, one of the four
attorneys who work out of the
informal (lilroy office. It is one of
eleven scattered throughout the state,
staffed by forty lawyers. In addition to
winning suits against government
agencies, CRLA has antagonized
powerful interest groups, including
growers. "We make l.hem give workers
the legal wage, proper sanitation, and
clean drinking water. This increases
their costs."
To Fleischer, the major role of the
(lilroy office is to act as ombudsmen
for the rural poor, to negotiate with

local officials, and to deal with their
other legal needs. In recent months, the
Gilroy office has attempted to stop a
grower from refusing to allow visitors
to farm laborers who live in shacks he
owns. In one of their more important
cases they managed to overturn a
provision requiring English literacy for
voting in California, a victory which
enfranchised thousands of Chicano
citizens.
A sampling of the Uhler report
reveals the strongly political nature of
the charges: "it has become crystal
clear that the political and emotional
bent of far too many CRLA attorneys
traverses the far left extremity of the
socio-political spectrum." It goes on to
claim that the organization is filled
with "true believers, hitchhiking a ride
at the expense of the rural poor to
achieve dislocation of our social,
political, and economic order."
A direct charge is that CKLA goes
out of its way to raise issues, while it
turns away small claims cases. Several
regional offices admit they do not have
the manpower to help every client who
comes to them. For instance, they
frequently refer divorce cases to other
lawyers. Stanford law student Elaine
Climpson, who has worked for the
central office in San Francisco,
explains, "By not helping every person
who comes in, CIJLA probably helps
more people than it would if it tried to
help everybody who came."

A large section of the report
attempts to connect CRLA attorneys
with the Soledad Brothers, black
inmates at Soledad prison who are
accused of murdering a white prison
guard. Former Stanford law student,
Louis Jaramillo, a CRLA research
assistant at the Salinas office, is
mentioned twice in the Uhler report for
visiting prisoners at Soledad. He admits
that he did indeed visit prisoners at
Soledad—hut at their request. There is
no regulation against CRLA personnel
visiting prisoners under such
circumstances.
A lengthy section of the report
details the activities of Oakland lawyer
Kaye Stender, who is not even
employed by CRLA. After linking her
with the Angela Davis case, the report
goes on to say that "Investigation has
shown that the relationship between
CRLA and Faye Stender is close." The
use of this kind of evidence has led
defenders of CRLA to complain that
the Uhler report employs
guilt-by-association tactics. Steve
Fleischer calls the report "Totally
political and totally cynical. It's a web
of lies."
A persistent claim in the report is
that CRLA is a radical organization.
Replies Klaine Clinipson, "Sure, they're
a little unorthodox in their approach,
and some of their people are pretty
radical, but I don't think CRLA itself is
radical. The best proof of that is that
the courts have consistently upheld
CRLA." Del Buono says "Anything
done to deprive the poor of their equal
rights hastens revolution. CRLA is just
trying to get the poor their equal
rights."

CRLA has gained considerable
support from other legal associations.
The American Bar Association and the
National Bar Association have rated
CRLA as the outstanding legal service
program in the country. CRLA people
are apprehensive about getting a fair
hearing before Carlucci's committee,
and are trying to get fair, open

hearings. The issue is squarely placed to
the Reagan administration: will it
support legaj representation to poor
people, Mexican-Americans, and other
minorities?
In place of CRLA, the Reagan
administration proposes an
"adjudi-care" system to be operated by
local bar associations. "Do you know
what happens when a poor person goes
to a place like that?" asks Del Buono.
"He walks in and talks to a
receptionist. She's usually the type who
asks you where you were born and
why! Poor people get extremely
frightened in these situations, and they
never come back."
The conflict between CRLA and
Reagan is largely philosophical. Reagan

Gilroy office has attempted to stop a
grower from refusing to allow visitors
to farm laborers who live in shacks he
owns. In one of their more important
cases they managed to overturn a
provision requiring English literacy for
voting in California, a victory which
enfranchised thousands of Chicano
citizens.
A sampling of the Uhler report
reveals the strongly political nature of
the charges: "it has become crystal
clear that the political and emotional
bent of far too many CRLA attorneys
traverses the far left extremity of the
socio-political spectrum." It goes on to
claim that the organization is filled
with "true believers, hitchhiking a ride
at the expense of the rural poor to
achieve dislocation of our social,
political, and economic order."
A direct charge is that CKLA goes
out of its way to raise issues, while it
turns away small claims cases. Several
regional offices admit they do not have
the manpower to help every client who
comes to them. For instance, they
frequently refer divorce cases to other
lawyers. Stanford law student Elaine
Climpson, who has worked for the
central office in San Francisco,
explains, "By not helping every person
who comes in, CIJLA probably helps
more people than it would if it tried to
help everybody who came."

A large section of the report
attempts to connect CRLA attorneys
with the Soledad Brothers, black
inmates at Soledad prison who are
accused of murdering a white prison
guard. Former Stanford law student,
Louis Jaramillo, a CRLA research
assistant at the Salinas office, is
mentioned twice in the Uhler report for
visiting prisoners at Soledad. He admits
that he did indeed visit prisoners at
Soledad—hut at their request. There is
no regulation against CRLA personnel
visiting prisoners under such
circumstances.
A lengthy section of the report
details the activities of Oakland lawyer
Kaye Stender, who is not even
employed by CRLA. After linking her
with the Angela Davis case, the report
goes on to say that "Investigation has
shown that the relationship between
CRLA and Faye Stender is close." The
use of this kind of evidence has led
defenders of CRLA to complain that
the Uhler report employs
guilt-by-association tactics. Steve
Fleischer calls the report "Totally
political and totally cynical. It's a web
of lies."
A persistent claim in the report is
that CRLA is a radical organization.
Replies Klaine Clinipson, "Sure, they're
a little unorthodox in their approach,
and some of their people are pretty
radical, but I don't think CRLA itself is
radical. The best proof of that is that
the courts have consistently upheld
CRLA." Del Buono says "Anything
done to deprive the poor of their equal
rights hastens revolution. CRLA is just
trying to get the poor their equal
rights."

CRLA has gained considerable
support from other legal associations.
The American Bar Association and the
National Bar Association have rated
CRLA as the outstanding legal service
program in the country. CRLA people
are apprehensive about getting a fair
hearing before Carlucci's committee,
and are trying to get fair, open

hearings. The issue is squarely placed to
the Reagan administration: will it
support legaj representation to poor
people, Mexican-Americans, and other
minorities?
In place of CRLA, the Reagan
administration proposes an
"adjudi-care" system to be operated by
local bar associations. "Do you know
what happens when a poor person goes
to a place like that?" asks Del Buono.
"He walks in and talks to a
receptionist. She's usually the type who
asks you where you were born and
why! Poor people get extremely
frightened in these situations, and they
never come back."
The conflict between CRLA and
Reagan is largely philosophical. Reagan
has charged that CRLA is not meeting
the needs of the poor. "Reagan thinks
that the needs of the poor are to have
the symptoms of poverty dealt with,
like bankruptcy and divorce. Our
purpose is to attack the fundamental
causes of poverty. This is what the
original grant of the OEO says is its
main goal," says Attorney Fleischer.
Ed Hayes, a Stanford law student
who worked for CRLA last year
comments, "I think what Reagan
meant is that CRLA is not meeting the
desires of the rich, and is meeting the
needs of the poor."
