# Revolution Later
## Apathy Hits Movement 
### CHRIS PECK Commentary 
A couple of hours before she was arrested on Wednesday; Theresa Ramirez sat
on the sunny roof of the computation center tossing pebbles into a small
chimney. "You know," she said, "I don't feel very much like a revolutionary up
here. It's just too nice a day."
While Theresa and others were getting their revolutionary, fervor pumping a
little faster as fifty armed police chased them around the computation center, the
rest of the Stanford students body kept on enjoying the niceness of that
afternoon. Throughout the maze of confusion the past few days, the majority of
Stanford's students have shown few signs of recognising much seriousness in the
issues being discussed, or the actions that surrounded those issues.
The university may or may not be the best place for political and social
confrontation and discussion, but the fact remains that the campus has been
turned into a stage for larger issues than whether or not there are any more canoes
left to rent at Lake Lagunita. But rallies in White Plaza, meetings in dorms, and
individual effort to generate interest in the larger issues of the past few days have
failed to generate much student interest.
What has happened at Stanford, is the creation of a cardboard revolution
complete with realistic settings, but where the cast has yet to appear on the scene.
Much like a recent anti-war slogan, Stanford's cry might well be "Suppose They
Gave a Revolution and Nobody came?"
Even if students felt this was not the time for a revolution, it seems most felt it
wasn't time for a rally behind the system either. Speeches by the ASSU Council of
Presidents and Congressmen Pete McCloskey drew fewer people than the
dwindling rallies at White Plaza. Possible political alternatives from the Free
Campus Movement's call to disband the anti-war movement to a hunger strike, to
the ASSU suggestion to write congressmen, to rally organizing groups to trash
windows all drew tiny crowds of lathargic students.
How feeble the cry of "Power to People" was at the computation center
Wednesday as students frantically ran to get out of the way of club-swinging
police. The only thing weaker was the plea by ASSU president Bob Grant for
reasonable alternatives to the occupation of the center.
Even after the blood of two shootings and three beatings spilled onto the white
"Beat SC" slogans in White Plaza on Wednesday night, their was neither a strong
show of protest over the actions nor a rallying cry for support of the movement.
President Lyman only urged students to stay in their dorms one more night.
If the last two days have shown anything, it is that Stanford students are by
and large apolitical to almost every conceivable political situation that could occur
on a college campus. Neither the policies of an unreliable government, outisde the
campus nor the actions of internal university leaders promoted many to alter the
daily routine of student life.
Perhaps the situation of the past few days has been so confusing that students
are paralized by the complexity of the issues. Perhaps most were not convinced
that there was any action they could take during the week which reflected their
particular views. Or perhaps the majority of students felt that the campus is not
the place to make a political stand.
It is difficult to imagine a situation more ripe for the building of a mass student
movement. But a movement has not been built For whatever the reason, the
thoughts of most Stanford students today will be on how to spend the three day
weekend.


MISSING LUNCH—The power (if the people apparently lies in their stomaches
not (heir concern over a night of violence at Stanford. Less than a tenth of the
undergraduate student body bothered to attend a noon rally to discuss the
violence yesterday noon.

"Beat SC" slogans in White Plaza on Wednesday night, their was neither a strong
show of protest over the actions nor a rallying cry for support of the movement.
President Lyman only urged students to stay in their dorms one more night.
If the last two days have shown anything, it is that Stanford students are by
and large apolitical to almost every conceivable political situation that could occur
on a college campus. Neither the policies of an unreliable government, outisde the
campus nor the actions of internal university leaders promoted many to alter the
daily routine of student life.
Perhaps the situation of the past few days has been so confusing that students
are paralized by the complexity of the issues. Perhaps most were not convinced
that there was any action they could take during the week which reflected their
particular views. Or perhaps the majority of students felt that the campus is not
the place to make a political stand.
It is difficult to imagine a situation more ripe for the building of a mass student
movement. But a movement has not been built For whatever the reason, the
thoughts of most Stanford students today will be on how to spend the three day
weekend.


MISSING LUNCH—The power (if the people apparently lies in their stomaches
not (heir concern over a night of violence at Stanford. Less than a tenth of the
undergraduate student body bothered to attend a noon rally to discuss the
violence yesterday noon.
A couple of hours before she was arrested on Wednesday; Theresa Ramirez sat
on the sunny roof of the computation center tossing pebbles into a small
chimney. "You know," she said, "I don't feel very much like a revolutionary up
here. It's just too nice a day."
While Theresa and others were getting their revolutionary, fervor pumping a
little faster as fifty armed police chased them around the computation center, the
rest of the Stanford students body kept on enjoying the niceness of that
afternoon. Throughout the maze of confusion the past few days, the majority of
Stanford's students have shown few signs of recognising much seriousness in the
issues being discussed, or the actions that surrounded those issues.
The university may or may not be the best place for political and social
confrontation and discussion, but the fact remains that the campus has been
turned into a stage for larger issues than whether or not there are any more canoes
left to rent at Lake Lagunita. But rallies in White Plaza, meetings in dorms, and
individual effort to generate interest in the larger issues of the past few days have
failed to generate much student interest.
What has happened at Stanford, is the creation of a cardboard revolution
complete with realistic settings, but where the cast has yet to appear on the scene.
Much like a recent anti-war slogan, Stanford's cry might well be "Suppose They
Gave a Revolution and Nobody came?"
Even if students felt this was not the time for a revolution, it seems most felt it
wasn't time for a rally behind the system either. Speeches by the ASSU Council of
Presidents and Congressmen Pete McCloskey drew fewer people than the
dwindling rallies at White Plaza. Possible political alternatives from the Free
Campus Movement's call to disband the anti-war movement to a hunger strike, to
the ASSU suggestion to write congressmen, to rally organizing groups to trash
windows all drew tiny crowds of lathargic students.
How feeble the cry of "Power to People" was at the computation center
Wednesday as students frantically ran to get out of the way of club-swinging
police. The only thing weaker was the plea by ASSU president Bob Grant for
reasonable alternatives to the occupation of the center.
Even after the blood of two shootings and three beatings spilled onto the white
"Beat SC" slogans in White Plaza on Wednesday night, their was neither a strong
show of protest over the actions nor a rallying cry for support of the movement.
