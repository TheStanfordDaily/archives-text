## We Are Responsible For War 
### 
doug ishee

Most of us here are today not
in favor of the war, and yet the
bombs continue to fall, crops are
burned, families are separated,
and people are massacred daily.
Reading the Congressional
Records for the mid-5 O's should
clarify the facade that we are
fighting against ungodly
Communism because it enslaves.
We are not against enslavement,
and never have been, as long as we
get something in return. We
support Franco in Spain, we
support petty dictators in South
America, until recently, we
supported a number of dictators
in Cuba, just as we support the
present puppet in South Vietnam.
For more than 2 0 years the
people of Vietnam have fought to
be free. They fought against the
.Japanese, then the French, and
now they fight us, and still they
desire to be free. The U.S.
financed 8 0 percent of the French
war effort, and although a major
figure in the prosecution of that
war, the U.S. refused to sign the
original Geneva Accords. This was
after the Viet Minh won at the
famous battle of Dien Bien Phu,
for even then, it was not the
intent of the United States to give
up control of a potential market
which could insure the economic
growth of the United States for
decades to come.
Unfortunately, or fortunately
for the people of Vietnam, a
quick profit could not be realized
by the presence of a few
"advisors." We are all aware of the
nightmarish history that has
followed so inconspicuous a
beginning.
Even as we stand here, we all
tend to say to ourselves, "But, I
was not in favor of the escalation
of the war into Cambodia, I am
not now in favor of the invasion
of Laos, and I am not in favor of a
U.S. supported invasion of North
Vietnam, should that come. It's

Johnson's war. It's Nixon's war.
It's the Administrations war. But,
to say that is to lie to oursevles. It
is your war. It is my war. Its OUR
war. We pay the taxes that makes
this war possible. We purchase
from the corporations that
support this war. We have done
the research.
I think it appropriate to turn
to a quote from a book entitled
"Inside the Third Reich," by
Speer:
"We owed the success of our
programs to thousands of
technicians with special
achievements to their credit to
whom we now entrusted the
responsibility for whole segments
of the armaments
industry . .. Basically, 1 exploited
the phenomenon of the
technician's often blind devotion
to his task. Because of what seems
to be the moral neutrality of
technology, these people were
without any scruples about their
activities. The more technical the
world imposed on us by the war,
the more dangerous was this
indifference of the technician to
the direct consequences of his
anonymous activities."
Well, I am a first year grad
student here, and I don't want to
become that blind technician. I
believe a scientist is morally
responsible for how his research is
used. I believe, as part of the
Stanford community, that I am
responsible for having allowed this
University to be used to further
the war effort. I believe every
person here is responsible, as
citizens in a democracy, for the
actions of our government.
Hence, I would like, at this
time, to make the following
proposal:
That the Stanford Medical
Center establish a committee to
raise funds for the specific
purpose of buying medical
supplies to be sent to the people

of North Vietnam and Laos as an
indication that the employees of
this Medical Center do not accept
the decision of the U.S.
government to invade Laos
without our consent.
Furthermore, that a small group
of medical personnel be sent to
personally present this symbolic
token of goodwill and genuine
desire for peace to the people of
Vietnam.
Representational democracy is
based on the consent of the
governed. When the
Administration is unwilling to ask
Congress to declare war for
obvious reasons, when the
government no longer represents
the desires of the oeople, and yet
has the audacity to commit
genocide in your name and mine,
then it is time to claim back that
trust which has been violated. A
trust for which we are still
ultimately responsible. One way
to reassert control over that
power which legally belongs to us
is to deny the legitimacy of the
present Administration. To say
No, we here at the Stanford
Medical Center are NOT at war
with the people of Indochina!
Consider the present anti-war
movement. What do you think of?
Long hairs, hippies throwing
rocks and breaking windows?
What make it that way? The
Antiwar movement is your
bastard child. Its lack of direction
today is a reflection of your
impotence. Unless you can say
that you have taken up your share
of the burden, unless you can say
that you have set aside a
significant portion of your life to
exercise your duty as a citizen,
then I don't want to hear
complaints about the movement.
The bastard child wails outside
your door. Is it so dirty that you
can't bring your hands to touch
it? Is it so imperfect that you
would strangle it rather than try
to make it more perfect?
There has been a call to strike.
Obviously the strike will not
affect the outcome of the war.
But, that is not the purpose of the
call. The purpose of the strike is
to affect you. There would be no
need to strike if we could sustain
a moderate yet significant effort
as individuals or in groups. I'm
not yet certain if I am in favor of
a strike. This Medical Center
provides important services for
the community, and I should not
like to see those services
discontinued. I should rather see
some sort of moratorium
extending for several days in
which this community lowers the
tempo of classes and work in
order that we might have time to
discuss amongst ourselves how we
can once again shoulder our
portion of the antiwar burden, to
open the door and given that child
a permanent home.
But if the majority here can
not be moved to a commitment
by a moratorium, then I must
align myself with those of you
who favor the agony of a strike.

Most of us here are today not
in favor of the war, and yet the
bombs continue to fall, crops are
burned, families are separated,
and people are massacred daily.
Reading the Congressional
Records for the mid-5 O's should
clarify the facade that we are
fighting against ungodly
Communism because it enslaves.
We are not against enslavement,
and never have been, as long as we
get something in return. We
support Franco in Spain, we
support petty dictators in South
America, until recently, we
supported a number of dictators
in Cuba, just as we support the
present puppet in South Vietnam.
For more than 2 0 years the
people of Vietnam have fought to
be free. They fought against the
.Japanese, then the French, and
now they fight us, and still they
desire to be free. The U.S.
financed 8 0 percent of the French
war effort, and although a major
figure in the prosecution of that
war, the U.S. refused to sign the
original Geneva Accords. This was
after the Viet Minh won at the
famous battle of Dien Bien Phu,
for even then, it was not the
intent of the United States to give
up control of a potential market
which could insure the economic
growth of the United States for
decades to come.
Unfortunately, or fortunately
for the people of Vietnam, a
quick profit could not be realized
by the presence of a few
"advisors." We are all aware of the
nightmarish history that has
followed so inconspicuous a
beginning.
Even as we stand here, we all
tend to say to ourselves, "But, I
was not in favor of the escalation
of the war into Cambodia, I am
not now in favor of the invasion
of Laos, and I am not in favor of a
U.S. supported invasion of North
Vietnam, should that come. It's

Johnson's war. It's Nixon's war.
It's the Administrations war. But,
to say that is to lie to oursevles. It
is your war. It is my war. Its OUR
war. We pay the taxes that makes
this war possible. We purchase
from the corporations that
support this war. We have done
the research.
I think it appropriate to turn
to a quote from a book entitled
"Inside the Third Reich," by
Speer:
"We owed the success of our
programs to thousands of
technicians with special
achievements to their credit to
whom we now entrusted the
responsibility for whole segments
of the armaments
industry . .. Basically, 1 exploited
the phenomenon of the
technician's often blind devotion
to his task. Because of what seems
to be the moral neutrality of
technology, these people were
without any scruples about their
activities. The more technical the
world imposed on us by the war,
the more dangerous was this
indifference of the technician to
the direct consequences of his
anonymous activities."
Well, I am a first year grad
student here, and I don't want to
become that blind technician. I
believe a scientist is morally
responsible for how his research is
used. I believe, as part of the
Stanford community, that I am
responsible for having allowed this
University to be used to further
the war effort. I believe every
person here is responsible, as
citizens in a democracy, for the
actions of our government.
Hence, I would like, at this
time, to make the following
proposal:
That the Stanford Medical
Center establish a committee to
raise funds for the specific
purpose of buying medical
supplies to be sent to the people

of North Vietnam and Laos as an
indication that the employees of
this Medical Center do not accept
the decision of the U.S.
government to invade Laos
without our consent.
Furthermore, that a small group
of medical personnel be sent to
personally present this symbolic
token of goodwill and genuine
desire for peace to the people of
Vietnam.
Representational democracy is
based on the consent of the
governed. When the
Administration is unwilling to ask
Congress to declare war for
obvious reasons, when the
government no longer represents
the desires of the oeople, and yet
has the audacity to commit
genocide in your name and mine,
then it is time to claim back that
trust which has been violated. A
trust for which we are still
ultimately responsible. One way
to reassert control over that
power which legally belongs to us
is to deny the legitimacy of the
present Administration. To say
No, we here at the Stanford
Medical Center are NOT at war
with the people of Indochina!
Consider the present anti-war
movement. What do you think of?
Long hairs, hippies throwing
rocks and breaking windows?
What make it that way? The
Antiwar movement is your
bastard child. Its lack of direction
today is a reflection of your
impotence. Unless you can say
that you have taken up your share
of the burden, unless you can say
that you have set aside a
significant portion of your life to
exercise your duty as a citizen,
then I don't want to hear
complaints about the movement.
The bastard child wails outside
your door. Is it so dirty that you
can't bring your hands to touch
it? Is it so imperfect that you
would strangle it rather than try
to make it more perfect?
There has been a call to strike.
Obviously the strike will not
affect the outcome of the war.
But, that is not the purpose of the
call. The purpose of the strike is
to affect you. There would be no
need to strike if we could sustain
a moderate yet significant effort
as individuals or in groups. I'm
not yet certain if I am in favor of
a strike. This Medical Center
provides important services for
the community, and I should not
like to see those services
discontinued. I should rather see
some sort of moratorium
extending for several days in
which this community lowers the
tempo of classes and work in
order that we might have time to
discuss amongst ourselves how we
can once again shoulder our
portion of the antiwar burden, to
open the door and given that child
a permanent home.
But if the majority here can
not be moved to a commitment
by a moratorium, then I must

as individuals or in groups. I'm
not yet certain if I am in favor of
a strike. This Medical Center
provides important services for
the community, and I should not
like to see those services
discontinued. I should rather see
some sort of moratorium
extending for several days in
which this community lowers the
tempo of classes and work in
order that we might have time to
discuss amongst ourselves how we
can once again shoulder our
portion of the antiwar burden, to
open the door and given that child
a permanent home.
But if the majority here can
not be moved to a commitment
by a moratorium, then I must
align myself with those of you
who favor the agony of a strike.

Most of us here are today not
in favor of the war, and yet the
bombs continue to fall, crops are
burned, families are separated,
and people are massacred daily.
Reading the Congressional
Records for the mid-5 O's should
clarify the facade that we are
fighting against ungodly
Communism because it enslaves.
We are not against enslavement,
and never have been, as long as we
get something in return. We
support Franco in Spain, we
support petty dictators in South
America, until recently, we
supported a number of dictators
in Cuba, just as we support the
present puppet in South Vietnam.
For more than 2 0 years the
people of Vietnam have fought to
be free. They fought against the
.Japanese, then the French, and
now they fight us, and still they
desire to be free. The U.S.
financed 8 0 percent of the French
war effort, and although a major
figure in the prosecution of that
war, the U.S. refused to sign the
original Geneva Accords. This was
after the Viet Minh won at the
famous battle of Dien Bien Phu,
for even then, it was not the
intent of the United States to give
up control of a potential market
which could insure the economic
growth of the United States for
decades to come.
Unfortunately, or fortunately
for the people of Vietnam, a
quick profit could not be realized
by the presence of a few
"advisors." We are all aware of the
nightmarish history that has
followed so inconspicuous a
beginning.
Even as we stand here, we all
tend to say to ourselves, "But, I
was not in favor of the escalation
of the war into Cambodia, I am
not now in favor of the invasion
of Laos, and I am not in favor of a
U.S. supported invasion of North
Vietnam, should that come. It's

Johnson's war. It's Nixon's war.
It's the Administrations war. But,
to say that is to lie to oursevles. It
is your war. It is my war. Its OUR
war. We pay the taxes that makes
this war possible. We purchase
from the corporations that
support this war. We have done
the research.
I think it appropriate to turn
to a quote from a book entitled
"Inside the Third Reich," by
Speer:
"We owed the success of our
programs to thousands of
technicians with special
achievements to their credit to
whom we now entrusted the
responsibility for whole segments
of the armaments
industry . .. Basically, 1 exploited
the phenomenon of the
technician's often blind devotion
to his task. Because of what seems
to be the moral neutrality of
technology, these people were
without any scruples about their
activities. The more technical the
world imposed on us by the war,
the more dangerous was this
indifference of the technician to
the direct consequences of his
anonymous activities."
Well, I am a first year grad
student here, and I don't want to
become that blind technician. I
believe a scientist is morally
responsible for how his research is
used. I believe, as part of the
Stanford community, that I am
responsible for having allowed this
University to be used to further
the war effort. I believe every
person here is responsible, as
citizens in a democracy, for the
actions of our government.
Hence, I would like, at this
time, to make the following
proposal:
That the Stanford Medical
Center establish a committee to
raise funds for the specific
purpose of buying medical
supplies to be sent to the people

of North Vietnam and Laos as an
indication that the employees of
this Medical Center do not accept
the decision of the U.S.
government to invade Laos
without our consent.
Furthermore, that a small group
of medical personnel be sent to
personally present this symbolic
token of goodwill and genuine
desire for peace to the people of
Vietnam.
Representational democracy is
based on the consent of the
governed. When the
Administration is unwilling to ask
Congress to declare war for
obvious reasons, when the
government no longer represents
the desires of the oeople, and yet
has the audacity to commit
genocide in your name and mine,
then it is time to claim back that
trust which has been violated. A
trust for which we are still
ultimately responsible. One way
to reassert control over that
power which legally belongs to us
is to deny the legitimacy of the
present Administration. To say
No, we here at the Stanford
Medical Center are NOT at war
with the people of Indochina!
Consider the present anti-war
movement. What do you think of?
Long hairs, hippies throwing
rocks and breaking windows?
What make it that way? The
Antiwar movement is your
bastard child. Its lack of direction
today is a reflection of your
impotence. Unless you can say
that you have taken up your share
of the burden, unless you can say
that you have set aside a
significant portion of your life to
exercise your duty as a citizen,
then I don't want to hear
complaints about the movement.
The bastard child wails outside
your door. Is it so dirty that you
can't bring your hands to touch
it? Is it so imperfect that you
would strangle it rather than try
to make it more perfect?
There has been a call to strike.
Obviously the strike will not
affect the outcome of the war.
But, that is not the purpose of the
call. The purpose of the strike is
to affect you. There would be no
need to strike if we could sustain
a moderate yet significant effort
as individuals or in groups. I'm
not yet certain if I am in favor of
a strike. This Medical Center
