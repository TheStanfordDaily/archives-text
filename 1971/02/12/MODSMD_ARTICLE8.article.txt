# Third World Student Union Statement

### 
The invasion of Laos is only an
escalation of the daily war that
the U.S. imperialists wage against
the toiling masses of the whole
world. In Indochina and Palestine,
it is open aggression. Within the
United States, they no longer
make any pretenses to veil the
criminal use of force necessary to
keep down peoples of color as
shown in the recent murder of a
Mexican American in Los Angeles
by the police, the arbitrary arrest
of three people at their home in
Chinatown on Monday night, the
countless numbers of Black
people murdered by the U.S.
police in the last few years only.
We know from these
experiences what the U.S. police
and armies are capable of e.g.,
Song My: They are not past
shooting an innocent teenager to
discredit any movement.
The U.S. government is now
preparing to invade North
Vietnam and is â€¢ testing the
political climate in this country
by announcing this through their

puppet Nguyen Cao Ky. In this
war, 4 0 percent of the casualties
are black and brown within the
U.S. forces; outside the U.S.
forces, 100 percent of the
casualties are Asian people.
Why is this large scale murder
possible? It is because of the
racism that the U.S. government
has rooted in some segments of
the American population and in
the U.S. anti-war movement. The
government has done this through
the Vietnamization program,
thoroughly supported and sold by
its mass-media; there are only
9,0 00 U.S. troops there, or only 6
Americans were killed; it is a war
for U.S. interests but only Asians
are dying, and that is all right and
perhaps even that is how it should
be.
The apathy of those who used
to actively oppose the war is
directly due to the racist
campaign pushed by the N.Y.
Times and the S.F. Chronicle
about how no American lives are
being risked, and to the racist

slogans raised by the U.S. anti-war
movements in the past, like
"Bring the troops home," "Asia"
to the Asians," "Stop escalation,"
and to racist flyers distributed by
the campus acolytes of Lyman
that say "What do you have in
common with Third World
people? Nothing." This racism
towards Asians is in turn due to
the fact that racism at home was
never looked into.
The Third World Student
Union believes that imperialism
and its main tool, racism, cannot
be exposed and defeated if we
repeat those mistakes. We urge
people not to be taken in by this
nationwide racist campaign of the
U.S. rulers, to expose it in every
way because it is racist not to
fight racism, and each individual
to fight the escalating aggression
in Indochina in the most militant
way compatible with his
commitment. We cannot fight
merely for the removal of
American troops from a so-called
Asian war, or only for the removal
of Blacks, or only of brown

people from the firing line. This
war continues because we are not
fighting against it, because we
have not fought the racism against
all people, brown, black, red, and
yellow people. Racism means
Vietnamization, 100 percent
Asian cannon fodder for the U.S.
interests, just as it means 4 0
percent brown and black cannon
fodder for U.S. interests.
Each and every one of us is
aware that the war is being
suffered by our brothers here in
the U.S. also, through
unemployment and inflation
(directly due to military
spending), through racist veterans
hired as policemen, through
educational, economic and
cultural discriminations. The daily
repression and terrorism goes on.
But at this time thy most massive
and the sharpest attack is against
our Asian brothers. We urge every
group and individual to fight this
aggression militantly. An attack
on one is a threat to all. Fight
racism to get the U.S. out of
South East Asia now.
