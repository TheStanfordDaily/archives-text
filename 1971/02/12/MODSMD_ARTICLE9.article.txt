# constructive change in research policy
## Alternative To Techno Trashing

Each year as spring approaches,
Stanford again examines its
research topics in answer to
charges that the projects prove
complicity in the Indochina War.
Each year the charges are leveled
most vocally by the "radicals,"
but many researchers continually
question their own consciences in
search of personal answers to the
broader problem of sources of
funding for high-cost academic
inquiry in the nation whose
largest backer of such endeavors is
the federal government. An
attempt was made to crucify the
Stanford Campus Computer
Facility, a highly visible and
vulnerable tool for the suspect
research, as the scapegoat for the
evils of a war almost universally

condemned by students and
faculty at this University.
This action merely serves as
one further illustration of the
difficulty of instituting
constructive change in research
policy when deep
misunderstandings exist between
the technical and non-technical
segments of the community. The
most politically active at Stanford
are also, in large part, the most ill
informed about the intent and
problems of technological
research and research methods.
Which brings us to an unhappy
paradox: the apolitical technical
person can only be funded by
assimilating military priorities,
while the politically conscious,
disturbing the motives and aims

of the scientist, alienates the
person who potentially could help
him realize some of his Utopian
social schemes, and refuses to
engage in the activities necessary
to change priorities if civilian
research is to be done. The
consequence for the university is a
running battle in which the "two
cultures" attack each other
literally and rhetorically with
little reconciliation possible.
I believe that there is a solution
to this problem for those seriously
desiring one, and not merely
engaged in campus power politics.
I suggest:
a) the formation of a task force
including both students and
faculty, representing the
researcher and the politically

active, to obtain private and
public funds for mutually
acceptable projects in such fields
as ecology, mass transportation,
housing, preventive medecine and
agriculture, and the basic
scientific research without which
continued advances in the
previously mentioned applied
fields would be impossible, and
b) a lobbying effort to
encourage Congress to appropriate
monies for research independent
of the DOD budget, recognizing
that the continued well-being and
security of this country rests on
solving the problems of unequal
development and resources among
nations abroad and between
economic classes at home, not on
the continued production of
white elephant "defense"
hardware.
The skeptic underestimates the
altruism of most scientists if he
believes that many university
researchers would choose military
funding over the civilian projects
which would be possible if this
program were adopted. And the
Computation Center, which, as an
expensive research tool, is
currently suffering severe financial
difficulties from the general
cutbacks of university support to
non-grant supported research, and
recession budget cuts by other
agencies, could afford to forego
outside revenues without
eliminating vital services if new
funds became available.
Finally, such a constructive
program, engaged in by all
segments of the Stanford
community, would help establish
the university as a reasoned voice
worthy of attention by decision
makers.
