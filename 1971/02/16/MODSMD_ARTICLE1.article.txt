# Policy To Ease Financial Burden
## 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
In a new Stanford land use
"policy/plan" recommended to the
Board of Trustees, San Francisco city
and regional planners Livingston and
Blayney called for increased industrial
and residential development of
University lands to ease the present
University tax burden ($835,000) and
provide new funds for "academic use."
The study, which cost the University
$40,000, recommends increasing lands
reserved for academic use, committing
seven areas to open space, developing
three areas, and considering alternative
uses for the use of the remaining lands.
According to Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
vice president for finance, "The choice
among these options will depend upon
further analysis and future
considerations."
Cuthbertson said that President
Richard Lyman and the Trustees
probably will begin a general review of
the report at their March meeting, and
that there will be further discussions
and review within the campus
community and with neighboring
jurisdictions before revision of overall
University land use plans.
Office Proposed
The study recommends that
the Mayfield School site and adjacent
frontage along El Camino Real at the
Page Mill corner be used for an office
building. It also calls for the extension
of the present Page Mill Industrial Park
along the 70 acres southeast of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Blvd., and
proposes a new industrial park to be
built on the 144 acre strip between
SLAC and Sand Hill Road.
The policy/plan proposes that the
University reserve from 68% to 76% of
its land for academic use. The major
increases to the present 5 ,200 -acre
reserve could come by adding the
Searsville Lake area to the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, and by including a
portion of the Webb Ranch area under
one of the alternative plans.
One of the primary considerations
for the study was the "financial
strength" of the University. And since
all Stanford lands not devoted to

academic use are subject to taxation,
the study recommended that, "if the
academic reserve and lands designated
for future development (or
alternatively one or the other) are not
to create a drain on the University's
finances, they must either be leased for
short terms at rentals that cover taxes
and other expenses, or taxed at levels
far below those reflecting market
prices; or most desirably, both
situations must be combined."
Leasing Coyote Hill
Taxes on lands developed for
industry are paid for by the industries,
hence the study also recommended
that, "First priority should be given
completion of leasing the presently
subdivided Coyote Hill portion of the
Industrial Park (leaving the hill itself in
permanent open space.)"
In five other areas, alternative land
uses should be considered, the report
stated. These are the 34 acres along
Willow Road, across from the Medical
Center, which are slated for either
"future offices or medical center
related uses." Also included in this
package are the 132 acres of Webb
Ranch east of the Freeway to be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential" and the 225 acres of
Guernsey Field at the corner of Sand
Hill and Whiskey Roads for "future
industrial park or residential." The 135
acres at Interdale, between Alpine
Road and the Freeway would be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential."
The use of those five areas,
combined with the commercial uses of
the proposed industrial parks and office
buildings, would provide the University
with $13 to $24 million in new funds
depending upon the options chosen.
The report stated that new
residential areas on Stanford land
should integrate low and moderate
income housing with market-priced
housing to prevent the creation of
"ghetto pockets" on small, isolated
sites. Guernsey Field, Webb Ranch west
and Interdale were seen as potential
residential neighborhoods. In addition,
two small areas, one west of Alpine
Road adjoining Portola Valley and the

other along Portola Road near
Woodside, are definitely recommended
for residential use under the plan.
Los-Cost Housing
However, the report said, "Future
policy on devoting Stanford lands to
low-moderate income housing probably
will be strongly influenced by
experience with the first project in the
Frenchman's Hill neighborhood." Since
future subsidized housing, the report
continued, "should be mixed with
market priced housing, it may be
advisable to postpone decisions on
future residential development until
results of the Peter Coutts Road project
can be evaluated."
Designated as open space in the
proposal are Coyote Hill itself, a Deer
Creek golf course, the 200 hilly acres
between Deer Creek and the Freeway,
the Felt Lake area, ridges west of Sand
Hill Road and south of the Freeway,
strips along San Francisquito, Deer and
Los Trancos Creeks, and the
Arboretum and campus athletic areas.
In addition, much of the academic
reserve lands would remain essentially
in open space.
"For ecological and visual
conservation, hill lands with slopes
exceeding 20 percent should remain in
open space," the report states.
Substantial portions of Stanford's
remaining open lands are in that
category, it noted.
One critic of the "policy/plan," a
graduate student in architecture, stated
that the plan "goes to great length in
calling for open space, but proposes no
guidelines as to how the University
should expand into this." He termed
the report "the kind of planning that
was done 20 years ago, with attention
paid only to industrial zoning."
No INsight
The student of architecture said that
the report "presented no real
innovative insight for all the real
possibilities. The whole Stanford
community should have been involved
in the plan. The trustees should have
made use of the expertise of our own
faculty, accumulated a large variety of
alternate plans and then made use of a

planner to correlate the ideas." He also
felt that the plan purposely
"downplayed housing" because it
would "not be of economic benefit to
the University."
Other objections to the
"policy/plan" included the report's
favorable bias toward the proposed
Willow Freeway and Foothill
Expressway extension which would
bring an additional 100,000 to 300,000
cars across University lands.

reserved for academic use, committing
seven areas to open space, developing
three areas, and considering alternative
uses for the use of the remaining lands.
According to Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
vice president for finance, "The choice
among these options will depend upon
further analysis and future
considerations."
Cuthbertson said that President
Richard Lyman and the Trustees
probably will begin a general review of
the report at their March meeting, and
that there will be further discussions
and review within the campus
community and with neighboring
jurisdictions before revision of overall
University land use plans.
Office Proposed
The study recommends that
the Mayfield School site and adjacent
frontage along El Camino Real at the
Page Mill corner be used for an office
building. It also calls for the extension
of the present Page Mill Industrial Park
along the 70 acres southeast of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Blvd., and
proposes a new industrial park to be
built on the 144 acre strip between
SLAC and Sand Hill Road.
The policy/plan proposes that the
University reserve from 68% to 76% of
its land for academic use. The major
increases to the present 5 ,200 -acre
reserve could come by adding the
Searsville Lake area to the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, and by including a
portion of the Webb Ranch area under
one of the alternative plans.
One of the primary considerations
for the study was the "financial
strength" of the University. And since
all Stanford lands not devoted to

academic use are subject to taxation,
the study recommended that, "if the
academic reserve and lands designated
for future development (or
alternatively one or the other) are not
to create a drain on the University's
finances, they must either be leased for
short terms at rentals that cover taxes
and other expenses, or taxed at levels
far below those reflecting market
prices; or most desirably, both
situations must be combined."
Leasing Coyote Hill
Taxes on lands developed for
industry are paid for by the industries,
hence the study also recommended
that, "First priority should be given
completion of leasing the presently
subdivided Coyote Hill portion of the
Industrial Park (leaving the hill itself in
permanent open space.)"
In five other areas, alternative land
uses should be considered, the report
stated. These are the 34 acres along
Willow Road, across from the Medical
Center, which are slated for either
"future offices or medical center
related uses." Also included in this
package are the 132 acres of Webb
Ranch east of the Freeway to be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential" and the 225 acres of
Guernsey Field at the corner of Sand
Hill and Whiskey Roads for "future
industrial park or residential." The 135
acres at Interdale, between Alpine
Road and the Freeway would be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential."
The use of those five areas,
combined with the commercial uses of
the proposed industrial parks and office
buildings, would provide the University
with $13 to $24 million in new funds
depending upon the options chosen.
The report stated that new
residential areas on Stanford land
should integrate low and moderate
income housing with market-priced
housing to prevent the creation of
"ghetto pockets" on small, isolated
sites. Guernsey Field, Webb Ranch west
and Interdale were seen as potential
residential neighborhoods. In addition,
two small areas, one west of Alpine
Road adjoining Portola Valley and the

other along Portola Road near
Woodside, are definitely recommended
for residential use under the plan.
Los-Cost Housing
However, the report said, "Future
policy on devoting Stanford lands to
low-moderate income housing probably
will be strongly influenced by
experience with the first project in the
Frenchman's Hill neighborhood." Since
future subsidized housing, the report
continued, "should be mixed with
market priced housing, it may be
advisable to postpone decisions on
future residential development until
results of the Peter Coutts Road project
can be evaluated."
Designated as open space in the
proposal are Coyote Hill itself, a Deer
Creek golf course, the 200 hilly acres
between Deer Creek and the Freeway,
the Felt Lake area, ridges west of Sand
Hill Road and south of the Freeway,
strips along San Francisquito, Deer and
Los Trancos Creeks, and the
Arboretum and campus athletic areas.
In addition, much of the academic
reserve lands would remain essentially
in open space.
"For ecological and visual
conservation, hill lands with slopes
exceeding 20 percent should remain in
open space," the report states.
Substantial portions of Stanford's
remaining open lands are in that
category, it noted.
One critic of the "policy/plan," a
graduate student in architecture, stated
that the plan "goes to great length in
calling for open space, but proposes no
guidelines as to how the University
should expand into this." He termed
the report "the kind of planning that
was done 20 years ago, with attention
paid only to industrial zoning."
No INsight
The student of architecture said that
the report "presented no real
innovative insight for all the real
possibilities. The whole Stanford
community should have been involved
in the plan. The trustees should have
made use of the expertise of our own
faculty, accumulated a large variety of
alternate plans and then made use of a

planner to correlate the ideas." He also
felt that the plan purposely
"downplayed housing" because it
would "not be of economic benefit to
the University."
Other objections to the
"policy/plan" included the report's
favorable bias toward the proposed
Willow Freeway and Foothill
Expressway extension which would
bring an additional 100,000 to 300,000
cars across University lands.

the report at their March meeting, and
that there will be further discussions
and review within the campus
community and with neighboring
jurisdictions before revision of overall
University land use plans.
Office Proposed
The study recommends that
the Mayfield School site and adjacent
frontage along El Camino Real at the
Page Mill corner be used for an office
building. It also calls for the extension
of the present Page Mill Industrial Park
along the 70 acres southeast of Page
Mill Road and Foothill Blvd., and
proposes a new industrial park to be
built on the 144 acre strip between
SLAC and Sand Hill Road.
The policy/plan proposes that the
University reserve from 68% to 76% of
its land for academic use. The major
increases to the present 5 ,200 -acre
reserve could come by adding the
Searsville Lake area to the Jasper Ridge
Biological Preserve, and by including a
portion of the Webb Ranch area under
one of the alternative plans.
One of the primary considerations
for the study was the "financial
strength" of the University. And since
all Stanford lands not devoted to

academic use are subject to taxation,
the study recommended that, "if the
academic reserve and lands designated
for future development (or
alternatively one or the other) are not
to create a drain on the University's
finances, they must either be leased for
short terms at rentals that cover taxes
and other expenses, or taxed at levels
far below those reflecting market
prices; or most desirably, both
situations must be combined."
Leasing Coyote Hill
Taxes on lands developed for
industry are paid for by the industries,
hence the study also recommended
that, "First priority should be given
completion of leasing the presently
subdivided Coyote Hill portion of the
Industrial Park (leaving the hill itself in
permanent open space.)"
In five other areas, alternative land
uses should be considered, the report
stated. These are the 34 acres along
Willow Road, across from the Medical
Center, which are slated for either
"future offices or medical center
related uses." Also included in this
package are the 132 acres of Webb
Ranch east of the Freeway to be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential" and the 225 acres of
Guernsey Field at the corner of Sand
Hill and Whiskey Roads for "future
industrial park or residential." The 135
acres at Interdale, between Alpine
Road and the Freeway would be used
for "academic reserve or future
residential."
The use of those five areas,
combined with the commercial uses of
the proposed industrial parks and office
buildings, would provide the University
with $13 to $24 million in new funds
depending upon the options chosen.
The report stated that new
residential areas on Stanford land
should integrate low and moderate
income housing with market-priced
housing to prevent the creation of
"ghetto pockets" on small, isolated
sites. Guernsey Field, Webb Ranch west
and Interdale were seen as potential
residential neighborhoods. In addition,
two small areas, one west of Alpine
Road adjoining Portola Valley and the

other along Portola Road near
Woodside, are definitely recommended
for residential use under the plan.
Los-Cost Housing
However, the report said, "Future
policy on devoting Stanford lands to
low-moderate income housing probably
will be strongly influenced by
experience with the first project in the
Frenchman's Hill neighborhood." Since
future subsidized housing, the report
continued, "should be mixed with
market priced housing, it may be
advisable to postpone decisions on
future residential development until
results of the Peter Coutts Road project
can be evaluated."
Designated as open space in the
proposal are Coyote Hill itself, a Deer
Creek golf course, the 200 hilly acres
between Deer Creek and the Freeway,
the Felt Lake area, ridges west of Sand
Hill Road and south of the Freeway,
strips along San Francisquito, Deer and
Los Trancos Creeks, and the
Arboretum and campus athletic areas.
In addition, much of the academic
reserve lands would remain essentially
in open space.
"For ecological and visual
conservation, hill lands with slopes
exceeding 20 percent should remain in
open space," the report states.
Substantial portions of Stanford's
remaining open lands are in that
category, it noted.
One critic of the "policy/plan," a
graduate student in architecture, stated
that the plan "goes to great length in
calling for open space, but proposes no
guidelines as to how the University
should expand into this." He termed
the report "the kind of planning that
was done 20 years ago, with attention
paid only to industrial zoning."
No INsight
The student of architecture said that
the report "presented no real
innovative insight for all the real
possibilities. The whole Stanford
community should have been involved
in the plan. The trustees should have
made use of the expertise of our own
faculty, accumulated a large variety of
alternate plans and then made use of a

planner to correlate the ideas." He also
felt that the plan purposely
"downplayed housing" because it
would "not be of economic benefit to
the University."
Other objections to the
"policy/plan" included the report's
favorable bias toward the proposed
Willow Freeway and Foothill
Expressway extension which would
bring an additional 100,000 to 300,000
cars across University lands.

In a new Stanford land use
"policy/plan" recommended to the
Board of Trustees, San Francisco city
and regional planners Livingston and
Blayney called for increased industrial
and residential development of
University lands to ease the present
University tax burden ($835,000) and
provide new funds for "academic use."
The study, which cost the University
$40,000, recommends increasing lands
reserved for academic use, committing
seven areas to open space, developing
three areas, and considering alternative
uses for the use of the remaining lands.
According to Kenneth M. Cuthbertson,
vice president for finance, "The choice
among these options will depend upon
