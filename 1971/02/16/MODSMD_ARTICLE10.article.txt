## Conflict With China? 
### 
Each development in the
Indochina War brings renewed
speculation about China's
response. Will the Chinese
intervene? Any evaluation of
possible Chinese response must
consider the foundations of
Chinese foreign policy: 1) Maoist
ideology, and 2) the way the
Chinese perceive their national
interest.
Maoist ideology holds that
wars of national liberation, in
which native forces oppose
intruding foreign powers, can and
should be successfully
independent of outside military
assistance. This means that native
forces must go it alone, with
strong moral support, but limited
military aid.
The Chinese perceive their
national interest as consisting
primarily of the protection of

China's borders. Since the
establishment of The Peoples'
Republic in 1949, China's major
military confrontations with other
countries have all involved a
perceived threat to her borders.
China is vulnerable to air attack
by conventional or nuclear
weapons. She sees the build-up of
hostile air power as a threat to her
national interest. These two
principles, defense of borders, and
defense from air attack, combine
in an essentially defensive foreign
policy, but one which does not
rule out military options.
How do these principles affect
China's response to the Indochina
War? The Chinese have
encouraged native resistance
forces, like the North Vietnamese,
the Viet Cong, the Pathet Lao,
and the Khmer Rouge. When
China perceives a threat to her
national interest, she gives more
than encouragement.
At the time of the Cambodian
invasion, the Chinese condemned
Nixon's policy and stepped up
material aid to the Khmer Rouge,
the native Cambodian resistance.
The Cambodian invasion gave the
Chinese a major diplomatic
victory. After the invasion, the
previously separate native
resistance movements of Vietnam,
Laos, and Cambodia, were united
under the leadership of Prince
Sihanouk with the strong support
of Peking. Cambodia and China
do not share a border, so the
American presence in Cambodia
does not immediately threaten
China's southern border. These
two factors combined to
determine the limited Chinese
response to the Cambodian
invasion.
Laos is a different story. Laos
lies directly on China's southern

border. The Chinese are more
involved with Laos than they were
with Cambodia; a Chinese road
crew is under contract to build
two roads in northern Laos. One
would expect a stronger Chinese
reaction to American presence in
Laos than in Cambodia. This is, in
fact, what is happening. The
Chinese pledge "support" for the
Cambodian resistance, and
"support and assistance" for the
Laotian struggle (Peking Review,
Jan. 29, 1971). This change in
terminology indicates great
concern, not only with the
invasion, but with what may
follow.
Now the Chinese take seriously
the possibility of U.S. use of
nuclear weapons in Indochina.
The Chinese suggest that the
Nixon administration is probing
public opinion on the possible use
of tactical nuclear weapons
(NCNA dispatch, Feb. 6 and 8,
1971) and refer specifically to the
January, 1971 issue of Foreign
Affairs. The Chinese also point to
U.S. mass removal of refugees
from northern South Vietnam as
preparation for the use of nuclear
weapons in i,he vacated area.
China would like to see
friendly or neutral neighbors on
her southern borders. American
escalation of the war into
Cambodia and Laos (and
Thailand? and Burma?) presents
China with a grave threat to her
national interests. So does the
increase in the air war which is an
integral part of Nixon's
withdrawal program. Are we
heading for a conflict with China?
Nixon's administration says no.
Can we trust them to be right
when they have been wrong so
often about so many things
concerning the Indochina War?
