# Laos Workshop
## 
### 
The Concerned Asian Scholars of Stanford are sponsoring a
teach-in on the invasion of Laos and the Indochina War from
1:00 to 3:00 p.m. tomorrow in Dinkelspiel auditorium. The
speakers will be Orville Schell, Earl Martin, and Alan Hitt. A
question-discussion session will follow the presentations. This will
give the people of Stanford and the surrounding community an
opportunity to come together, using some of the expertise
available here, to find out what is happening and discuss it. It's a
chance for those who believe people should learn more about the
war to do it.
Laos represents a crisis in the war. That means a crisis for this
country whether or not there is another massive wave of popular
revulsion. It is a crisis whether ( or not we do anything; whether we
let the decisions be made without our opposition or not. Insofar
as we are part of this country it is also a crisis in our own
community. This goes far beyond problems of violence and
disruption. What is the business of the university in a time like
this? What continues as usual; what doesn't? If a teach-in during
class hours constitutes an unacceptable disruption of the normal
working of the university, then what a terrible commentary this is
on the moral and intellectual vacuity of the university and those
who defend it.
Resistance is neither morally nor politically futile. The
expression of popular outrage raises at least the political price of
atrocity. Participation in the teach-in is a tiny statement which
can be made at little personal cost by each person in this
community. We are awake to what Nixon's government is doing
and we are seeking ways to stop it.
All in the community and the university, townspeople,
employees, faculty, students, are urged to join the teach-in. All
departments and professors have been requested by CCAS to
suspend normal operations to allow employees and students to
attend.
