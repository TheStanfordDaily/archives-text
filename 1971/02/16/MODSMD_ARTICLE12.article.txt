# value of life
## American Racist Policies 
### 
The value of life of a white American is the
security of his $30,000 home and well-paying job
in a prideworthy company, the happiness of his
weekends with the family and company of his
Club friends, the pride of "contributing to
society", of patriotism and civic concern. The
value of life of an American is very high. It is
determined by how much money his beloved wife
and children will receive from his life insurance.
The value of life of an Asian is neglible. It is, by
and large, a buffalo, a few hectares of paddy fields,
a bamboo hut, and too many children to feed.
And often it is not even that. The value of life for
a famiiy-less Vietnamese refugee is so neglible as to
be almost nil. Except for the clothes on his back,
what is there for him to live for? In the face of
such deplorable suffering and poverty, his life, in
the grand scale of the human condition and his
own self-estimation, is nothing. How can a Laotian
or Vietnamese peasant's life be even fractionally as
valuable as the life of an American, who is so
much an individual, and has so much to lose if he
should die?
Was it not Dean Ruck who justified it all by
saying, in effect, that even the Asians themselves
do not value life as much as the West does, and in
Asia life is not as precious as in the West?
And so the argument runs. It is not an
argument so much as a mentality that pervades
American consciousness, crossing class and age
lines. It is incredibly strong because it is
subconscious, and basically racist.
In the Vietnam War not even death is the great
equaliser. All hell will break loose in campuses and
Congress if American troops are entering Laos, but
as long as American soldiers are not killed the
killing of Asians may continue: napalm,
fragmentary bombs, any kind of death that may
be delivered to the Asian peasant without danger
to American blood. The news media will explode
at the discovery of one dead GI who was found in
Laos, but will not even bother to mention the
casualties of those who have suffered and will go
on suffering for a very long time - the Asians.

In the present Laos invasion the bulk of white
Americans are content to sit back and see if Nixon
will stick by his withdrawal timetable. If he will,
all is well. If killing thousands of Laotian peasants
and manipulating Asians to kill Asians will
expedite the withdrawal of American troops, and
save American lives, by all means, it must be done.

Nixon's—and the governing elite of this country,
from the politicians to businessmen—rationale for
the invasion of Laos is that it will save the lives of
withdrawing American troops, and the bombing
that kills and maimes innocent peasants
indiscriminately is "protective reaction," a
blatantly racist attitude that protects not the
South Vietnamese soldiers or Asian masses, but
the American troops. And so if the killing
continues, as long as American troops are not
being killed, and as long as the American allies do

not lose significantly enough to jeopardise
American interests, the war is proceeding well.
It is even "de-escalating." What deescalation
means is that this week perhaps only six
Americans died as opposed to the hundreds
months ago. Does it hardly matter that since
Nixon came to power there has been more
bombing than all the years before him, that at the
price of saving some American lives, many
thousands of Asians will be sacrificed? Racism in
America will not end until the profound
consciousness that allows the bombing of
Indochina to continue so that a few American lives
may be saved, is also ended.
There must arise vehement condemnation of
the arrogant and myopic parochialism of American
culture and consciousness: the immorality which
not only advocates killing but rates one American
death equal to ten, or hundreds of Asian deaths,
and the dehumanizing racism which denies an
equal humanness to any person who is not white,
which refuses to acknowledge that the value of a
poor, black, or brown life is equal to that of a rich,
white, life.
All Americans who begin to find themselves
apathetic to the war because it is not taking
American lives, must realise and change this
profoundly racist consciousness which pits man
against man and makes impossible any kind of
universal brotherhood in which compassion and
mutual respect may operate.
And lastly there must be action, not the kind
that will make Congress withdraw American
troops from Indochina only to deploy them
elsewhere, but rather the individual commitment
to changing this racist consciousness which is
manifested in Indochina but latent everywhere
else. A total, personal commitment to change, in
any direct action compatible with one's degree of
radicalisation, the consciousness which places
racial priorities on life; and to affirm, not white,
not black, not brown, but the sanctity of life
itself.
