## Support For The Invasion 
### 
The following arc excepts from a taped,
telephone interview conducted specifically for
this forum
How does the allied invasion of Laos fit into
Nixon's stated policy of winding down the
war?
First of all, it is not an invasion. It is a
defensive opperation against an enemy who is
holding territory he is not entitled to hold.
This particular territory is a base area from
which the communists are able to attack the
northern portion of South Vietnam. If this
territory is no longer at their disposal the
target country is no longer logistically
accesible to them. Consequently, the threat
against South Vietnam will be substantially
reduced, and this will be a major step towards
the winding down of the war.
Why have some commentators suggested that
the allied invasion will lead to the fall of the
neutralist government in Laos?
I don't know why they suggested it, but I
would guess that they think that perhaps the
North Vietnamese would undertake a major
invasion of Laos, and take over control of the
country.
How and when might nuclear weapons be used
in Laos?
They won't be used.
Are we fighting for the Souvana Phouma
government, or are we merely defending
ourselves?
We are not fighting for the Souvana
Phouma government. We are fighting for the
general principle that we oppose aggression.
This is in the interests of a government like
that of Souvana Phouma.
Do you think that this invasion indicates that
President Nixon is still attempting to win a
military victory in Southeast Asia?
Frankly, I don't understand this particular
question. The strategic alternatives in
Southeast Asia are covered up by many
cliches. The alternative seems to be between a
political and military settlement. But this is
not a genuine alternative.
To win a military victory, which means that
you eliminate the source of the aggression,
means that we would have to take out the
North Vietnamese regime. That was never our
intention, never our plan either under Johnson
or under Nixon. However, if the military
position of South Vietnam, and ourselves, is
such that the North Vietnamese really cannot
achieve their objectives, which include the
complete takeover bv one means or the other

of South Vietnam, ihen they will be more
inclined to arrange a truce.
I don't think they will accept a peace
treaty, because no Communist state really has
accepted peace treaties so far. There is no
peace treaty in Germany, no peace treaty in
Korea, and so on. The main thing is that you
have to establish a position in which it is
unproductive for them to continue their
opperations, and you then may arrive at a
modis vivendi. There will be no political
settlement of any kind if the military situation
cannot be stabalized.
How does Nixon plan to accomplish those
goals, what is his grand plan in Indochina?
I don't know what his grand plan in
Indochina is; I do know how the strategy has
evolved. The first step was to make it
impossible for the communists to conquer
South Vietnam. The second step was to
eliminate their Cambodian base areas and the
logistics line through the Cambodian ports. As
a result the situation in the southern and
middle part of South Vietnam is greatly
improved so that there is barely any
insurrectional trouble there right now.
This operation of last year did not include
the communist base areas in Southern Laos,
which are the bases from which the Northern
part of South Vietnam has been attacked.
Furthermore the Southern part of Laos is one
of the shunting tables of the Ho Chi Hinh
logistics road system.
As a third step, therefore, what was left
undone last year is now being completed in
Southern Laos. If the Cambodian and Laotian
base areas are not usable by the Communists,
then they have very little possibility to attack
South Vietnam. The entire question of
communist attack on South Vietnam becomes
a completely internal threat, and that, I am
fairly certain, the South Vietnamese can
handle.
How does the saturation bombing of Northern
Laos and parts of Cambodia fit in with this
plan?
There is not a saturation bombing of either
one. There is a logistics bombing, and
occasionally a tactical support bombing. These
are different things. If you have a lot of
military equipment on the logistical supply
lines, and you bomb it, it makes it very
difficult for the enemy to maintain his
operational level, and he will have trouble
holding on to his positions.
In other words, you do on the ground

Stefan possony

something that you support from the air, and
conversly, you do something in the air which
you support on the ground. The two are
interrelated. The specific targets which we
have been bombing in Indochina for the last
few years usually, were either one of two
types, either it was a logistics target, or it was a
military position.
Do you believe Nixon's statement that we
don't have ground troups in Laos at the
present time?
I don't see any reason to doubt it. He is
committed not to have them, so why should
he use them. The meaning of American ground
troops fighting in Laos is that there are
American units which have crossed the border
and are engaged in an operational mission. I
don't think there are any. There does not seem
to be any need for them.
I advise caution in accepting reports by so
called observors that American troops have
been sighted in Laos. Hostile psychological
warfare performs the self-evident mission of
embarassing the U.S. government.
On April 16, 1954 U.S. News and World
Report wrote, "Tin, rubber, rice, key strategic
raw materials are what the war is really about.
The U.S. sees it as a place to hold—at any
cost." Do you agree with this analysis?
That report is 17 years old and precedes our
real involvement in Vietnamese affairs by 11
years. If it had been true in 1954, perhaps the
policy of France would have been different.
The tin isn't in Vietnam or anywhere in
Indochina. There is rice in Vietnam, but even
at full production it isn't very much, and no
one but North Vietnam needs it. The main
rubber comes out of Malasia.
The war is being fought over the question
of whether a communist aggressive power can
go on a rampage and take over other countries.
American policy has been clear since the
signing of the UN charter and the conclusion
of the NATO alliance—this policy has been
steady for more than 20 years. This policy has
always been we want to contain, prevent,
avoid, and deter communist takeovers of
countries which desire to keep their
independence.

Report wrote, "Tin, rubber, rice, key strategic

That report is 17 years old and precedes our
real involvement in Vietnamese affairs by 11
years. If it had been true in 1954, perhaps the
policy of France would have been different.
The tin isn't in Vietnam or anywhere in
Indochina. There is rice in Vietnam, but even
at full production it isn't very much, and no
one but North Vietnam needs it. The main
rubber comes out of Malasia.
The war is being fought over the question
of whether a communist aggressive power can
go on a rampage and take over other countries.
American policy has been clear since the
signing of the UN charter and the conclusion
of the NATO alliance—this policy has been
steady for more than 20 years. This policy has
always been we want to contain, prevent,
avoid, and deter communist takeovers of
countries which desire to keep their
independence.

The following arc excepts from a taped,
telephone interview conducted specifically for
this forum
How does the allied invasion of Laos fit into
Nixon's stated policy of winding down the
war?
First of all, it is not an invasion. It is a
defensive opperation against an enemy who is
holding territory he is not entitled to hold.
This particular territory is a base area from
which the communists are able to attack the
northern portion of South Vietnam. If this
territory is no longer at their disposal the
target country is no longer logistically
accesible to them. Consequently, the threat
against South Vietnam will be substantially
reduced, and this will be a major step towards
the winding down of the war.
Why have some commentators suggested that
the allied invasion will lead to the fall of the
neutralist government in Laos?
I don't know why they suggested it, but I
would guess that they think that perhaps the
North Vietnamese would undertake a major
invasion of Laos, and take over control of the
country.
How and when might nuclear weapons be used
in Laos?
They won't be used.
Are we fighting for the Souvana Phouma
government, or are we merely defending
ourselves?
We are not fighting for the Souvana
Phouma government. We are fighting for the
general principle that we oppose aggression.
This is in the interests of a government like
that of Souvana Phouma.
Do you think that this invasion indicates that
President Nixon is still attempting to win a
military victory in Southeast Asia?
Frankly, I don't understand this particular
question. The strategic alternatives in
Southeast Asia are covered up by many
cliches. The alternative seems to be between a
political and military settlement. But this is
not a genuine alternative.
To win a military victory, which means that
you eliminate the source of the aggression,
means that we would have to take out the
North Vietnamese regime. That was never our
intention, never our plan either under Johnson
or under Nixon. However, if the military
position of South Vietnam, and ourselves, is
such that the North Vietnamese really cannot
achieve their objectives, which include the
complete takeover bv one means or the other

of South Vietnam, ihen they will be more
inclined to arrange a truce.
I don't think they will accept a peace
treaty, because no Communist state really has
accepted peace treaties so far. There is no
peace treaty in Germany, no peace treaty in
Korea, and so on. The main thing is that you
have to establish a position in which it is
unproductive for them to continue their
opperations, and you then may arrive at a
modis vivendi. There will be no political
settlement of any kind if the military situation
cannot be stabalized.
How does Nixon plan to accomplish those
goals, what is his grand plan in Indochina?
I don't know what his grand plan in
Indochina is; I do know how the strategy has
evolved. The first step was to make it
impossible for the communists to conquer
South Vietnam. The second step was to
eliminate their Cambodian base areas and the
logistics line through the Cambodian ports. As
a result the situation in the southern and
middle part of South Vietnam is greatly
improved so that there is barely any
insurrectional trouble there right now.
This operation of last year did not include
the communist base areas in Southern Laos,
which are the bases from which the Northern
part of South Vietnam has been attacked.
Furthermore the Southern part of Laos is one
of the shunting tables of the Ho Chi Hinh
logistics road system.
As a third step, therefore, what was left
undone last year is now being completed in
Southern Laos. If the Cambodian and Laotian
base areas are not usable by the Communists,
then they have very little possibility to attack
South Vietnam. The entire question of
communist attack on South Vietnam becomes
a completely internal threat, and that, I am
fairly certain, the South Vietnamese can
handle.
How does the saturation bombing of Northern
Laos and parts of Cambodia fit in with this
plan?
There is not a saturation bombing of either
one. There is a logistics bombing, and
occasionally a tactical support bombing. These
are different things. If you have a lot of
military equipment on the logistical supply
lines, and you bomb it, it makes it very
difficult for the enemy to maintain his
operational level, and he will have trouble
holding on to his positions.
In other words, you do on the ground

Stefan possony

something that you support from the air, and
conversly, you do something in the air which
you support on the ground. The two are
interrelated. The specific targets which we
have been bombing in Indochina for the last
few years usually, were either one of two
types, either it was a logistics target, or it was a
military position.
Do you believe Nixon's statement that we
don't have ground troups in Laos at the
present time?
I don't see any reason to doubt it. He is
committed not to have them, so why should
he use them. The meaning of American ground
troops fighting in Laos is that there are
American units which have crossed the border
and are engaged in an operational mission. I
don't think there are any. There does not seem
to be any need for them.
I advise caution in accepting reports by so
called observors that American troops have
been sighted in Laos. Hostile psychological
warfare performs the self-evident mission of

As a third step, therefore, what was left
undone last year is now being completed in
Southern Laos. If the Cambodian and Laotian
base areas are not usable by the Communists,
then they have very little possibility to attack
South Vietnam. The entire question of
communist attack on South Vietnam becomes
a completely internal threat, and that, I am
fairly certain, the South Vietnamese can
handle.
How does the saturation bombing of Northern
Laos and parts of Cambodia fit in with this
plan?
There is not a saturation bombing of either
one. There is a logistics bombing, and
occasionally a tactical support bombing. These
are different things. If you have a lot of
military equipment on the logistical supply
lines, and you bomb it, it makes it very
difficult for the enemy to maintain his
operational level, and he will have trouble
holding on to his positions.
In other words, you do on the ground

Stefan possony

something that you support from the air, and
conversly, you do something in the air which
you support on the ground. The two are
interrelated. The specific targets which we
have been bombing in Indochina for the last
few years usually, were either one of two
types, either it was a logistics target, or it was a
military position.
Do you believe Nixon's statement that we
don't have ground troups in Laos at the
present time?
I don't see any reason to doubt it. He is
committed not to have them, so why should
he use them. The meaning of American ground
troops fighting in Laos is that there are
American units which have crossed the border
and are engaged in an operational mission. I
don't think there are any. There does not seem
to be any need for them.
I advise caution in accepting reports by so
called observors that American troops have
been sighted in Laos. Hostile psychological
warfare performs the self-evident mission of
embarassing the U.S. government.
On April 16, 1954 U.S. News and World
Report wrote, "Tin, rubber, rice, key strategic
raw materials are what the war is really about.
The U.S. sees it as a place to hold—at any
cost." Do you agree with this analysis?
That report is 17 years old and precedes our
real involvement in Vietnamese affairs by 11
years. If it had been true in 1954, perhaps the
policy of France would have been different.
The tin isn't in Vietnam or anywhere in
Indochina. There is rice in Vietnam, but even
at full production it isn't very much, and no
one but North Vietnam needs it. The main
rubber comes out of Malasia.
The war is being fought over the question
of whether a communist aggressive power can
go on a rampage and take over other countries.
American policy has been clear since the
signing of the UN charter and the conclusion
of the NATO alliance—this policy has been
steady for more than 20 years. This policy has
always been we want to contain, prevent,
avoid, and deter communist takeovers of
countries which desire to keep their
independence.

The following arc excepts from a taped,
telephone interview conducted specifically for
this forum
How does the allied invasion of Laos fit into
Nixon's stated policy of winding down the
war?
First of all, it is not an invasion. It is a
defensive opperation against an enemy who is
holding territory he is not entitled to hold.
This particular territory is a base area from
which the communists are able to attack the
northern portion of South Vietnam. If this
territory is no longer at their disposal the
target country is no longer logistically
accesible to them. Consequently, the threat
against South Vietnam will be substantially
reduced, and this will be a major step towards
the winding down of the war.
Why have some commentators suggested that
the allied invasion will lead to the fall of the
neutralist government in Laos?
I don't know why they suggested it, but I
would guess that they think that perhaps the
North Vietnamese would undertake a major
invasion of Laos, and take over control of the
country.
How and when might nuclear weapons be used
in Laos?
They won't be used.
Are we fighting for the Souvana Phouma
government, or are we merely defending
ourselves?
We are not fighting for the Souvana
Phouma government. We are fighting for the
general principle that we oppose aggression.
This is in the interests of a government like
that of Souvana Phouma.
Do you think that this invasion indicates that
President Nixon is still attempting to win a
military victory in Southeast Asia?
Frankly, I don't understand this particular
question. The strategic alternatives in
Southeast Asia are covered up by many
cliches. The alternative seems to be between a
political and military settlement. But this is
not a genuine alternative.
To win a military victory, which means that
you eliminate the source of the aggression,
means that we would have to take out the
North Vietnamese regime. That was never our
intention, never our plan either under Johnson
or under Nixon. However, if the military
position of South Vietnam, and ourselves, is
such that the North Vietnamese really cannot
achieve their objectives, which include the
complete takeover bv one means or the other

of South Vietnam, ihen they will be more
inclined to arrange a truce.
I don't think they will accept a peace
treaty, because no Communist state really has
accepted peace treaties so far. There is no
peace treaty in Germany, no peace treaty in
Korea, and so on. The main thing is that you
have to establish a position in which it is
unproductive for them to continue their
opperations, and you then may arrive at a
modis vivendi. There will be no political
settlement of any kind if the military situation
cannot be stabalized.
How does Nixon plan to accomplish those
goals, what is his grand plan in Indochina?
I don't know what his grand plan in
Indochina is; I do know how the strategy has
evolved. The first step was to make it
impossible for the communists to conquer
South Vietnam. The second step was to
eliminate their Cambodian base areas and the
logistics line through the Cambodian ports. As
a result the situation in the southern and
middle part of South Vietnam is greatly
improved so that there is barely any
insurrectional trouble there right now.
This operation of last year did not include
the communist base areas in Southern Laos,
which are the bases from which the Northern
part of South Vietnam has been attacked.
Furthermore the Southern part of Laos is one
of the shunting tables of the Ho Chi Hinh
logistics road system.
As a third step, therefore, what was left
undone last year is now being completed in
Southern Laos. If the Cambodian and Laotian
base areas are not usable by the Communists,
