# TRUSTEE COMMITTEE ON INVESTMENT RESPONSIBILITY
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has established an ad hoc committee of
five trustees, one faculty member and one student (all mem
bers of the Trustees' Committees on Investments, Finance, or
Academic affairs) to recommend to the Board a policy state
ment on the voting of corporate stocks held by Stanford and
related issues of investment policy where social and ethical
issues may be involved. 1
The ad hoc committee invites all interested members of the
Stanford community (faculty, students, staff, and alumni) to
submit in writing by February 25 statements or suggestions
that they feel should be considered by the committee in pre
paring its recommendations to the Board of Trustees.
Please send all communications to Fred Glover, Assistant to the
President, Building 10, who will forward them to committee
members.
