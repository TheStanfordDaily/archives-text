# Marchers, Pickets To Protest War
## 
### 
A "March for Peace" into Palo Alto
and an informational picket at
Hewlett-Packard have been planned for
today by several different anti-war
groups, some newly-formed as a result
of the invasion of Laos.
The March for Peace, billed by its
student organizers as a non-violent,
legal action to protest the invasion of
Laos, will leave this noon from in front
of the Quad.
A group of Palo Alto citizens will
demonstrate at Hewlett-Packard's
facilities in the industrial park, with the
support of the Coalition Against the
War in Indochina, from Stanford.
David Packard, co-founder of
Hewlett-Packard and a former member
of the board of Trustees, is presently
deputy secretary of Defense.
Columbae House has planned a
meeting to study "all forms of
non-violent direct action" against the
war in Indochina to follow up their
plans for an economic boycott.
Today's Palo Alto march is aiming

to reach the 73% of the public who
support the concept of an early pullout
from Vietnam. Accompanied by at
least 100 monitors, including 30
faculty, it will pass by Lytton Plaza in
downtown Palo Alto to pick up
residents during their lunch hour. The
march plans to end with a short rally in
El Camino Park, across from the
Stanford shopping center.
Says Bob Grant, one of the march's
organizers, "Virtually the whole
campus wishes to do something about
the war but they are sick of the
violence they've seen on campus."
Palo Alto police have been very
helpful in giving a permit for the
march, adds Grant. Afterwards,
participants will split into small groups
to discuss convassing and methods of
rallying support for the Vietnam
Disengagement Act, the present form
of the MeGovern Hatfield Amendment
which would set a definite date for the
withdrawal of troops from Indochina.
At a meeting Sunday afternoon, the

Coalition Against the War in Indochina
(CAWI), an umbrella organization for
various anti-war groups at Stanford,
issued a statement urging a voluntary
boycott of classes today.
The two-week old coalition
cancelled a march to the industrial park
to allow its members to attempt to
cducate participants in the March for
Peace on the significance of the recent
injunction and Stanford's involvement
in the war effort.
Venceremos, the New Left Project,
the Pacific Studies Center, members of
the Medical School, and other
autonomous organizations make up
CAWI.
The Columbae house hopes to
"explore creative forms of action to
effect change within or outside Ihe
University." Besides an economic
boycott, their ideas include various
forms of civil disobedience and guerilla
theater. They have spent the past few
weeks collecting and updating research
into Stanford's involvemenl with the
\v;ir effort.
