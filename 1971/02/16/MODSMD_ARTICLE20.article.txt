# Freestylers Power USC To Close Win
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In what is rapidly becoming an
annual classic, the Stanford and
USC swimming teams went down
to the last event before the Tro
jans could pull out a 61-52 win
Saturday at the Stanford Pool.
FYom beginning to end, the
meet was close and as it
progressed it seemed that the
meet very well might hinge on
that final event, the 400 yard
freestyle relay. It did, and that
event turned out to be as close as
the whole meet.
In the five freestyle events
preceding the relay, the Trojans
had picked up 38 out of a possible
45 points. With this kind of
freestyle strength and depth, one
would have thought that USC
would have won easily. But they
didn't.
The Stanford team of Martin
Pedley, Steve Carey, John Ferris
and Fred Haywood came within
1/2 a second of beating the
mighty Trojan freestylers and
winning their third straight dual
meet over USC.
But on the last leg, USC's
Frank Heckl, who had earlier won
the 50 and 100 yard freestyle
events, took over less than half a
length behind Haywood and
ended up holding him off by an
arm's length, to give USC the
event in a time of 3:08 .0.

The meet had started off with
as close a race as the freestyle
relay. With Rick Longinotti filling
in for Ferris on the butterfly leg
of the 400 yard medley relay, the
Indians won a close race by .6
seconds, 3:32.8 to 3:33.4. But as
it turned out, Stanford could've
won in 10:32.8 since USC had
been disqualified for an illegal
turn.
Through the rest of the meet,
Stanford offset the Trojan
freestyle domination with 1-2
finishes in both diving events and
the 200 yard breaststroke. Bill
Main won the one meter diving
with Ted Nichols in second, and
the two switched places in the
three meter event.
And in the 200 breastroke,
Brian Job and Dave Scholling
forced the meet down to the final
event with Job winning in 2:08.9
and Schilling .7 seconds behind.
Earlier, Schilling had finished
second in the 200 yard individual
medley in 2:00.1 with Job .6
seconds back in third place.
Other Stanford wins came
from John Ferris in the 200 fly
(1:5 2.8) and Haywood in the 200
back (1:5 8.3). USC cracked
Stanford four pool records with
Heckl's 46.7 in the 100 free and
his 21.3 in the 5 0 free Tom
Mcßreen's 4:40.7 in the 500 free
and their relay team's 3:08.0 •

THE END—Fred Haywood is seen immediately following the 400
yard freestyle relay against USC Saturday. Haywood had a slight edge
at the start of the last leg, but USC's Frank Heckl caught and passed
him to give USC the event by half a second and the meet by nine
points 61-5 2.
