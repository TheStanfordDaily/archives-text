# First League Win For Card Cagers
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
After having lost nine straight
games in the last month and a half
of action, Stanford's basketball
team finally got back on the
winning track with a 77-70
victory over Washington State
Saturday night.
The win was the first for the
Indians in their last fourteen
league games, and in part made up
for a dissappointing 81-80 loss
sustained at the hands of the
Washington Huskies Friday night.
Starting extremely slowly
against the Huskies, the Indians
fell behind by 22 points at
half-time. The poor performance
was caused partly by the
adjustment necessitated by
playing with 6-10 center Larry
Rosenzweig for the first time this
season. Rosenzweig appeared
awkward and nervous in the first
half, and showed the effects of his
long absence.

In the second half, the Cards
gradually began to whittle away at
the Huskies large half-time lead.
Hitting an amazing 70 percent of
their field goal attempts, and
rebounding as well as they have all
year, Stanford cut the Huskies'
lead to 81-80 with 43 seconds
remaining.
After a stolen pass with 23
seconds left to play, the best the
Cards could manage was a
desperation 30 foot shot by Pat
Stevens, which fell short at the
buzzer.
The momentum generated by
the Indians in the second half
Friday carried over to Saturday.
Claude Terry, who led the scoring
with 25 against the Huskies, was
virtually unstoppable on
Saturday, as he mixed his usual
excellent outside shooting with
some fine drives to score 2 7
against the Cougars.
