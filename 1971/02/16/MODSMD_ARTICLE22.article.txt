# SJC Hearings Continue

The case of the seven Lodge
defendants is expected to end this
afternoon.
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
will meet at 1 :30 p.m. to hear Assistant
to the Provost John Schwartz make his
concluding remarks concerning the
seven students charged with disrupting
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech here on January 11.
The Council will then deliberate on
any penalties to be imposed against the
seven defendants who walked out of
their February 9 hearing pleading Nolo
contendere not contesting the charges.
On Friday the Council heard 17
witnesses give five hours of testimony
that the defendants had yelled, clapped
and chanted at the beginning of
Lodge's Dinkelspiel speech. The speech
had been cancelled following the
continued noise from the audience.
President Lyman announced at his
weekly press conference yesterday that
the suspensions of four of the
defendants were being lifted.

The four had been suspended for
contempt of the chair at the January
29 hearing of the case, and the
suspensions had been expected to last
for the duration of the case.
Lyman said he lifted the suspensions
after receiving a letter from SJC
Chairman Howard Williams
recommending such action.
At Friday's hearing SJC student
member Chris Winkle initially moved
that charges against the defendants be
dropped charging that President Lyman
in remarks made the previous day had
"completely prejudiced the case."
There were no spectators at Friday's
hearing in Cubberley 76 in sharp
contrast to the previous three hearings.
At the first two, overflow crowds had
forced their way into the hearing room
and heavy security was necessary to
keep people out of the third hearing.
It was at that hearing that the
defendants walked out calling the
hearing "farcical."
