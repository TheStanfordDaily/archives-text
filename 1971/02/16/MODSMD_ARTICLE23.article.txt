# Sup plies Collected For Vietnam
## 
### 
Four hundred Anthropology and
Medical students have formed a
Committee for Medical Supplies to
Indochina to raise money for the North
Vietnamese, the Viet Cong and the
Pathet Lao.
The committee plans to work
through the American Friends Service
Committee, which has already delivered
penicillin and immunization equipment
to Hanoi and the VC. 100% of funds
collected will be used for purchasing
goods and equipment, since the AFSC
will pay transport and administrative
costs.
In an open letter delivered to
President Lyman this morning, the
committee chided him for criticizing
student protests without providing
constructive leadership against the war.
Offering Lyman an honorary
co-chairmanship, the committee asked
for a contribution of half of a month's
salary (in accordance with the amount
being asked of Anthro grad students)
for supplies to the North Vietnamese
and Pathet Lao.
Due to the unusual legal status of
the war, donations to the AFSC for
these materials are not only legal but
tax deductible.
According to Anthro grad student
Paul Diener, "We don't see this as an
alternative to political action, but
rather as a concrete way to show our
disgust with Nixon's invasion of Laos.
We also want Lyman to intercede for us

with the big contributors in the
community."
Diener described the group as a
"responsible, not radical body that
seeks meaningful action to protest the
Laos invasion." Calling the letter to
Lyman "firm but not angry," he feels
that a negative response to the letter
will be "a reaction against students but
not against Laos." The letter will be
mimeographed and distributed at the
noon march today.

"We need lots of help and lots of
money, especially students to contact
faculty members and solicit support,"
continued Diener. "We've written to
over 100 schools asking student leaders
to start collecting with us."

Students who wish to contribute or
join the committee may contact
members at either the Anthropology
lounge (ext. 3110) or the Medical
school lounge (ext. 5335).
