# Lyman Suspends Franklin; Court Enjoins Disrupters
## 
### MARGIE WOLF BOB DRAZOVICH 
President Richard Lyman summarily
suspended associate English professor
H. Bruce Franklin Friday for his
"important role" in last Wednesday's
"tragic events" and asked for Franklin's
permanent dismissal.
The radical professor, with sixteen
named individuals and up to 1000
"John Does," has also been enjoined by
a Superior Court temporary restraining
order from commiting destructive or
disruptive acts on campus.
Acting under the University tenure
policy, Lyman said that he suspended
Franklin because, "In my judgement,
this conduct represents a gross
impairment of the performance of
Franklin's appropriate functions within
the University community."
However, Professor Franklin
expressed a feeling of responsibility to
his class on "Literature of thel93o's."

"I feel that I should teach the class as
normal since I have been teaching it all
of this quarter. As always anyone not
normally enrolled in the class is
welcome to attend. The reading for
Tuesday's class is Red Star Over
China," he added.
Restraining Order
The temporary restraining order,
(TRO) besides naming Franklin, was
also aimed at the organization
Venceremos, a radical group active on
campus. Franklin and two other
defendants are on the Venceremos
Central Committee.
A hearing to show cause why the
order should not be enforced is
scheduled for Thursday morning at
9:30. Non-students have been ordered
to show cause at that time why they
should not be barred from campus
effective following the hearing.
In the complaint, filed in the
California Superior Court, attorneys for

the Board of Trustees alleged that since
mid-January the 17 defendants have
"incited, counselled, advised and
urged" those present at rallies to do
such acts as throwing rocks at windows
and occupying buildings.
On last Wednesday, the immediate
reason for the injunction occured when
radicals occupied the Computation
Center and two persons were shot by
an unknown assailant while standing
with members of the conservative Free
Campus movement.
Students named in the order include
Bradley Dowden, Don Lee, Merle
Rabine, Theresa Ramirez, Ted Smith,
and Sharon Winslow. Students
suspended pending the outcome of
Stanford Judicial Council hearings and
named in the order include Geraldine
Foote, Michael Holman, and Janet
Weiss.
Non-Student
Non-students named include Jane
Franklin, Katherine Barkely, Michael
Fox, Andrea Holman, Chris
Katzenbach, Aaron Manganiello, and
Jeffery Youdelman.
Unless defendants prove otherwise
at the Thursday hearing, the temporary
restraining order now in effect will
become a preliminary injunction. Those \
named may then take the matter to full
court proceedings. The University's
complaint states that if the matter
comes to trial, the University will seek
recovery for more than $5000 worth of
physical damage to the campus.
Those named in the order stated the
University was trying to intimidate the
radical movement, and claimed that

Stanford was acting because it
recognized a powerful threat.
Franklin is suspended with pay—the
maximum penalty Lyman can invoke
on his own initiative. The President will
propose to the all-faculty Advisory
Board that Franklin be permanently
dismissed.
In a letter to Franklin, Lyman stated
that since January 11, the date of the
Henry Cabot Lodge speech disruption,
"You have on several
occasions . . . urged, incited, and led
Stanford students and others to
interfere with operations of the Univ
ersity and conduct themselves in an
unlawful manner, and have yourself so
acted, most notably on Wednesday,
February 10.
"In my judgement, this conduct
represents a gross impairment of the
performance of your appropriate
functions within the University
community. I will therefore add these
charges to the charges to be preferred
arising from your conduct during the
Lodge incident and propose that you
be dismissed from your position on the
Stanford faculty."
Franklin, when asked to comment
on the suspension, laughed and stated,
"This is the decade of the boomerang.
The reactionaries are picking up rocks
and dripping them on their own feet.
They are acting like ostriches." He
added, "When there's oppression,
there's resistance."
lan Watt, chairman of the English
Department, yesterday issued a
statement which read, in part, "The
various circumstances which have led to
President Lyman's immediate
suspension of Professor Franklin, and
the initiation of dismissal proceedings
against him, were not within our
control. "We personally regret that we
must now face the possibility of losing
a colleague and a gifted scholar and

teacher whose approach to literature,
though not wholly shared by any of us,
certainly deserves a hearing."
The statement continued, "During
the present suspension the Knglish
faculty will make interim arrangements

as soon as possible for the continuance
of Prof. Franklin's courses ..."
No details on the possible
replacement instructors for Franklin's
English 2708 course were immediately
available. 270 B "Literature of the
19305" is the only course which
Franklin is teaching this quarter.
(The full text of Prof. Watt's
statement will be printed in the
"Letters to the Editor" section of
tomorrow's Daily.) Because of
Franklin's suspension and the issuance
of the restraining order, the Daily
decided to print a special issue on
Saturday.
"We felt it was extremely important
to inform the community about
Professor Franklin's suspension and
about the injunction as soon as
possible, especially considering that our
next scheduled issue would not be
published until Tuesday," said Daily
editor Felicity Barringer.
Another paper, The Liberated Daily,
was also published on Saturday, using
some of the Daily's formats. The
Liberated Daily was, however, in no
way connected with the Daily. The
Liberated Daily was printed on offset
presses at the Free University, while the

comes to trial, the University will seek
recovery for more than $5000 worth of
physical damage to the campus.
Those named in the order stated the
University was trying to intimidate the
radical movement, and claimed that

Stanford was acting because it
recognized a powerful threat.
Franklin is suspended with pay—the
maximum penalty Lyman can invoke
on his own initiative. The President will
propose to the all-faculty Advisory
Board that Franklin be permanently
dismissed.
In a letter to Franklin, Lyman stated
that since January 11, the date of the
Henry Cabot Lodge speech disruption,
"You have on several
occasions . . . urged, incited, and led
Stanford students and others to
interfere with operations of the Univ
ersity and conduct themselves in an
unlawful manner, and have yourself so
acted, most notably on Wednesday,
February 10.
"In my judgement, this conduct
represents a gross impairment of the
performance of your appropriate
functions within the University
community. I will therefore add these
charges to the charges to be preferred
arising from your conduct during the
Lodge incident and propose that you
be dismissed from your position on the
Stanford faculty."
Franklin, when asked to comment
on the suspension, laughed and stated,
"This is the decade of the boomerang.
The reactionaries are picking up rocks
and dripping them on their own feet.
They are acting like ostriches." He
added, "When there's oppression,
there's resistance."
lan Watt, chairman of the English
Department, yesterday issued a
statement which read, in part, "The
various circumstances which have led to
President Lyman's immediate
suspension of Professor Franklin, and
the initiation of dismissal proceedings
against him, were not within our
control. "We personally regret that we
must now face the possibility of losing
a colleague and a gifted scholar and

teacher whose approach to literature,
though not wholly shared by any of us,
certainly deserves a hearing."
The statement continued, "During
the present suspension the Knglish
faculty will make interim arrangements

as soon as possible for the continuance
of Prof. Franklin's courses ..."
No details on the possible
replacement instructors for Franklin's
English 2708 course were immediately
available. 270 B "Literature of the
19305" is the only course which
Franklin is teaching this quarter.
(The full text of Prof. Watt's
statement will be printed in the
"Letters to the Editor" section of
tomorrow's Daily.) Because of
Franklin's suspension and the issuance
of the restraining order, the Daily
decided to print a special issue on
Saturday.
"We felt it was extremely important
to inform the community about
Professor Franklin's suspension and
about the injunction as soon as
possible, especially considering that our
next scheduled issue would not be
published until Tuesday," said Daily
editor Felicity Barringer.
Another paper, The Liberated Daily,
was also published on Saturday, using
some of the Daily's formats. The
Liberated Daily was, however, in no

Liberated Daily was printed on offset
presses at the Free University, while the

President Richard Lyman summarily
suspended associate English professor
H. Bruce Franklin Friday for his
"important role" in last Wednesday's
"tragic events" and asked for Franklin's
permanent dismissal.
The radical professor, with sixteen
named individuals and up to 1000
"John Does," has also been enjoined by
a Superior Court temporary restraining
order from commiting destructive or
disruptive acts on campus.
Acting under the University tenure
policy, Lyman said that he suspended
Franklin because, "In my judgement,
this conduct represents a gross
impairment of the performance of
Franklin's appropriate functions within
the University community."
However, Professor Franklin
expressed a feeling of responsibility to
his class on "Literature of thel93o's."

"I feel that I should teach the class as
normal since I have been teaching it all
of this quarter. As always anyone not
normally enrolled in the class is
welcome to attend. The reading for
Tuesday's class is Red Star Over
China," he added.
Restraining Order
The temporary restraining order,
(TRO) besides naming Franklin, was
also aimed at the organization
Venceremos, a radical group active on
campus. Franklin and two other
defendants are on the Venceremos
Central Committee.
A hearing to show cause why the
order should not be enforced is
scheduled for Thursday morning at
9:30. Non-students have been ordered
to show cause at that time why they
should not be barred from campus
effective following the hearing.
In the complaint, filed in the
California Superior Court, attorneys for

the Board of Trustees alleged that since
mid-January the 17 defendants have
"incited, counselled, advised and
urged" those present at rallies to do
such acts as throwing rocks at windows
and occupying buildings.
On last Wednesday, the immediate
reason for the injunction occured when
radicals occupied the Computation
Center and two persons were shot by
an unknown assailant while standing
with members of the conservative Free
Campus movement.
Students named in the order include
Bradley Dowden, Don Lee, Merle
Rabine, Theresa Ramirez, Ted Smith,
and Sharon Winslow. Students
suspended pending the outcome of
Stanford Judicial Council hearings and
named in the order include Geraldine
Foote, Michael Holman, and Janet
Weiss.
Non-Student
Non-students named include Jane
Franklin, Katherine Barkely, Michael
Fox, Andrea Holman, Chris
Katzenbach, Aaron Manganiello, and
Jeffery Youdelman.
Unless defendants prove otherwise
at the Thursday hearing, the temporary
restraining order now in effect will
become a preliminary injunction. Those \
named may then take the matter to full
court proceedings. The University's

possible, especially considering that our
next scheduled issue would not be
published until Tuesday," said Daily
editor Felicity Barringer.
Another paper, The Liberated Daily,
was also published on Saturday, using
some of the Daily's formats. The

President Richard Lyman summarily
suspended associate English professor
H. Bruce Franklin Friday for his
"important role" in last Wednesday's
"tragic events" and asked for Franklin's
permanent dismissal.
The radical professor, with sixteen
named individuals and up to 1000
"John Does," has also been enjoined by
a Superior Court temporary restraining
order from commiting destructive or
disruptive acts on campus.
Acting under the University tenure
policy, Lyman said that he suspended
Franklin because, "In my judgement,
this conduct represents a gross
impairment of the performance of
Franklin's appropriate functions within
the University community."
However, Professor Franklin
expressed a feeling of responsibility to
his class on "Literature of thel93o's."

"I feel that I should teach the class as
normal since I have been teaching it all
of this quarter. As always anyone not
normally enrolled in the class is
welcome to attend. The reading for
Tuesday's class is Red Star Over
China," he added.
Restraining Order
The temporary restraining order,
(TRO) besides naming Franklin, was
also aimed at the organization
Venceremos, a radical group active on
campus. Franklin and two other
defendants are on the Venceremos
Central Committee.
A hearing to show cause why the
order should not be enforced is
scheduled for Thursday morning at
9:30. Non-students have been ordered
to show cause at that time why they
should not be barred from campus
effective following the hearing.
In the complaint, filed in the
California Superior Court, attorneys for

the Board of Trustees alleged that since
mid-January the 17 defendants have
"incited, counselled, advised and
urged" those present at rallies to do
such acts as throwing rocks at windows
and occupying buildings.
On last Wednesday, the immediate
reason for the injunction occured when
radicals occupied the Computation
Center and two persons were shot by
an unknown assailant while standing
with members of the conservative Free
Campus movement.
Students named in the order include
Bradley Dowden, Don Lee, Merle
Rabine, Theresa Ramirez, Ted Smith,
and Sharon Winslow. Students
suspended pending the outcome of
Stanford Judicial Council hearings and
named in the order include Geraldine
Foote, Michael Holman, and Janet
Weiss.
Non-Student
Non-students named include Jane
Franklin, Katherine Barkely, Michael
Fox, Andrea Holman, Chris
Katzenbach, Aaron Manganiello, and
Jeffery Youdelman.
Unless defendants prove otherwise
at the Thursday hearing, the temporary
restraining order now in effect will
become a preliminary injunction. Those \
named may then take the matter to full
court proceedings. The University's
complaint states that if the matter
comes to trial, the University will seek
recovery for more than $5000 worth of
physical damage to the campus.
Those named in the order stated the
University was trying to intimidate the
radical movement, and claimed that

Stanford was acting because it
recognized a powerful threat.
Franklin is suspended with pay—the
maximum penalty Lyman can invoke
on his own initiative. The President will
propose to the all-faculty Advisory
Board that Franklin be permanently
dismissed.
In a letter to Franklin, Lyman stated
that since January 11, the date of the
Henry Cabot Lodge speech disruption,
"You have on several
occasions . . . urged, incited, and led
Stanford students and others to
interfere with operations of the Univ
ersity and conduct themselves in an
unlawful manner, and have yourself so
acted, most notably on Wednesday,
February 10.
"In my judgement, this conduct
represents a gross impairment of the
performance of your appropriate
functions within the University
community. I will therefore add these
charges to the charges to be preferred
arising from your conduct during the
Lodge incident and propose that you
be dismissed from your position on the
Stanford faculty."
Franklin, when asked to comment
on the suspension, laughed and stated,
"This is the decade of the boomerang.
The reactionaries are picking up rocks
and dripping them on their own feet.
They are acting like ostriches." He
added, "When there's oppression,
there's resistance."
lan Watt, chairman of the English
Department, yesterday issued a
statement which read, in part, "The
various circumstances which have led to
President Lyman's immediate
suspension of Professor Franklin, and
the initiation of dismissal proceedings
against him, were not within our
control. "We personally regret that we
must now face the possibility of losing
a colleague and a gifted scholar and

teacher whose approach to literature,
though not wholly shared by any of us,
certainly deserves a hearing."
The statement continued, "During
the present suspension the Knglish
faculty will make interim arrangements

as soon as possible for the continuance
of Prof. Franklin's courses ..."
No details on the possible
replacement instructors for Franklin's
English 2708 course were immediately
available. 270 B "Literature of the
19305" is the only course which
Franklin is teaching this quarter.
(The full text of Prof. Watt's
statement will be printed in the
"Letters to the Editor" section of
tomorrow's Daily.) Because of
Franklin's suspension and the issuance
of the restraining order, the Daily
decided to print a special issue on
Saturday.
"We felt it was extremely important
to inform the community about
Professor Franklin's suspension and
about the injunction as soon as

next scheduled issue would not be
