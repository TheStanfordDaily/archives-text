# Injunction To Speed Sanctions
## 
### JIM WARE SUSAN WARE News Analysis 
Last Friday, attorneys for Stanford's
Board of Trustees obtained a
temporary restraining order (TRO) in
California Superior Court enjoining
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, 16 other
named defendants, the organization
Venceremos and up to 1000 "John
Does" from committing disruptive or
destructive acts. These acts include
painting, nailing, bricking, burning,
smashing, 'trashing'," occupying any
campus building or classroom for the
purpose and with the effect of
disrupting, or intentionally remaining
in a building after it has been officially
closed.
The TRO applies to all members of
Venceremos and its Central Committee.
In other words, if the Board of Trustees
can establish that a person is a member
of Venceremos or can establish to the
court's satisfaction that he is associated
with the revolutionary organization, he
may be the TRO.
John Does
In addition, the order applies to
1000 Does. California law allows
defendants to be served under fictitious
names if the Board of Trustees does not
know their names. However, the true
names must be added to the original
complaint before the order can
to them.
At a press conference yesterday,
President Lyman explained that the
additional defendants can be added
only by going back to the court with
specific evidence linking them to some
past events.
Hence, while the TRO mentions
1000 John Does, the actual number to
be added probably falls below that
total, because the TRO was not
designed to "create a net for scooping
up people for political activity,"
according to Lyman. Indeed, the
California Supreme Court has ruled
that a TRO may not be used for
interfering with constitutional rights.
To obtaining TRO, the University
first files a complaint, a legal document
setting forth the harm which has and
will be done by the defendants.
If the court finds these allegations
sufficient, a temporary restraining
order is issued. This is an interim order
of short duration, normally ten days
from the date of issue, until the
defendants have an opportunity to
show cause why the TRO should not
become an injunction.
A temporary restraining order ceases
to be effective upon denial of a
preliminary injunction. If the
preliminary injunction is granted, the
TRO is superseded.

Therefore, if the named defendants
commit any act enjoined by the TRO,
they may be held in civil or criminal
contempt of court. If so held,
punishment may be imposed of a fine
of $500 or less or five days
imprisonment, or both. If civil
contempt proceedings are brought it is
true that the University will bear the
legal expenses, which could be quite
high.
But these expenses may be
minimized by joining a large number of
contemnors in one trial, alternatively if
criminal contempt is brought, the State
of California pays the cost of counsel.
With respect to the Doe defendants,
the rule is that a person may be guilty
of contempt of court if the University
names him as a defendant because of
his past acts, or if he acts in concern
with a named defendant in committing
enjoined acts. In addition, he must have
actual or constructive notice of the
provisions of the injunction.
A person would have actual notice if
he were personally served with a copy
of the injunction or if he appeared at
the hearing when the injunction was
granted. Constructive notice may be
given, for example, by placing the
injunction in the Dailv.
If a person enters into concert with
a defendant to commit any acts in
violation of the injunction he may be
found guilty of conspiracy to commit a
misdemeanor, which is a felony
punishable by imprisonment for not
less than six months.
Proceedings Available
In short, if a named defendant now
goes out and breaks a window, he may

be found guilty of violating the Campus
Policy on Disruptions, Malicious
Mischief, and contempt of court. If
the University learns the name of a
person who broke a window, they may
add him to the injunction as a
defendant. He is then also subject to
the above proceedings.
If the University never learns that a
person has broken a window and
therefore is never named as a
defendant, but the person acts in
concert with a named defendant, he is
also subject to the above proceedings.
Of course, the coust is free to liberally
interpret the terms "acting in concert"
and "aiding and abetting."
The significance of the TRO is that
the University now has an effective
immediate sanction available against
both students and nonstudents.
Previously, if a student trashed a
building, and his identity was known,
the University could initiate SJC
proceedings against him. A student or
nonstudent was only subject to
criminal sanctions if an officer could
testify that he saw him commit the act
and arrested him immediately.
Under TRO a contempt charge can
be brought on the testimony of anyone
who saw the act, not just an arresting
officer. In addition, certain nonstudent
disrupters can be excluded from
campus if they cannot show cause
Thursday morning why this provision
should not be invoked.
This prohibition of nonstudents
disrupters from coming on campus was
not included in a similar injunction
issued in May, 1969. President Lyman
was indicated that this prohibition is
one of the major purposes of the
present TRO.

can establish that a person is a member
of Venceremos or can establish to the
court's satisfaction that he is associated
with the revolutionary organization, he
may be the TRO.
John Does
In addition, the order applies to
1000 Does. California law allows
defendants to be served under fictitious
names if the Board of Trustees does not
know their names. However, the true
names must be added to the original
complaint before the order can
to them.
At a press conference yesterday,
President Lyman explained that the
additional defendants can be added
only by going back to the court with
specific evidence linking them to some
past events.
Hence, while the TRO mentions
1000 John Does, the actual number to
be added probably falls below that
total, because the TRO was not
designed to "create a net for scooping
up people for political activity,"
according to Lyman. Indeed, the
California Supreme Court has ruled
that a TRO may not be used for
interfering with constitutional rights.
To obtaining TRO, the University
first files a complaint, a legal document
setting forth the harm which has and
will be done by the defendants.
If the court finds these allegations
sufficient, a temporary restraining
order is issued. This is an interim order
of short duration, normally ten days
from the date of issue, until the
defendants have an opportunity to
show cause why the TRO should not
become an injunction.
A temporary restraining order ceases
to be effective upon denial of a
preliminary injunction. If the
preliminary injunction is granted, the
TRO is superseded.

Therefore, if the named defendants
commit any act enjoined by the TRO,
they may be held in civil or criminal
contempt of court. If so held,
punishment may be imposed of a fine
of $500 or less or five days
imprisonment, or both. If civil
contempt proceedings are brought it is
true that the University will bear the
legal expenses, which could be quite
high.
But these expenses may be
minimized by joining a large number of
contemnors in one trial, alternatively if
criminal contempt is brought, the State
of California pays the cost of counsel.
With respect to the Doe defendants,
the rule is that a person may be guilty
of contempt of court if the University
names him as a defendant because of
his past acts, or if he acts in concern
with a named defendant in committing
enjoined acts. In addition, he must have
actual or constructive notice of the
provisions of the injunction.
A person would have actual notice if
he were personally served with a copy
of the injunction or if he appeared at
the hearing when the injunction was
granted. Constructive notice may be
given, for example, by placing the
injunction in the Dailv.
If a person enters into concert with
a defendant to commit any acts in
violation of the injunction he may be
found guilty of conspiracy to commit a
misdemeanor, which is a felony
punishable by imprisonment for not
less than six months.
Proceedings Available
In short, if a named defendant now
goes out and breaks a window, he may

be found guilty of violating the Campus
Policy on Disruptions, Malicious
Mischief, and contempt of court. If
the University learns the name of a
person who broke a window, they may
add him to the injunction as a
defendant. He is then also subject to
the above proceedings.
If the University never learns that a
person has broken a window and
therefore is never named as a
defendant, but the person acts in
concert with a named defendant, he is
also subject to the above proceedings.
Of course, the coust is free to liberally
interpret the terms "acting in concert"
and "aiding and abetting."
The significance of the TRO is that
the University now has an effective
immediate sanction available against
both students and nonstudents.
Previously, if a student trashed a
building, and his identity was known,
the University could initiate SJC
proceedings against him. A student or
nonstudent was only subject to
criminal sanctions if an officer could
testify that he saw him commit the act
and arrested him immediately.
Under TRO a contempt charge can
be brought on the testimony of anyone
who saw the act, not just an arresting
officer. In addition, certain nonstudent
disrupters can be excluded from
campus if they cannot show cause
Thursday morning why this provision
should not be invoked.
This prohibition of nonstudents
disrupters from coming on campus was
not included in a similar injunction
issued in May, 1969. President Lyman
was indicated that this prohibition is
one of the major purposes of the
present TRO.
Last Friday, attorneys for Stanford's
Board of Trustees obtained a
temporary restraining order (TRO) in
California Superior Court enjoining
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, 16 other
named defendants, the organization
Venceremos and up to 1000 "John
Does" from committing disruptive or
destructive acts. These acts include
painting, nailing, bricking, burning,
smashing, 'trashing'," occupying any
campus building or classroom for the
purpose and with the effect of
disrupting, or intentionally remaining
in a building after it has been officially
closed.
The TRO applies to all members of
Venceremos and its Central Committee.

1000 John Does, the actual number to
be added probably falls below that
total, because the TRO was not
designed to "create a net for scooping
up people for political activity,"
according to Lyman. Indeed, the
California Supreme Court has ruled
that a TRO may not be used for
interfering with constitutional rights.
To obtaining TRO, the University
first files a complaint, a legal document
setting forth the harm which has and
will be done by the defendants.
If the court finds these allegations
sufficient, a temporary restraining
order is issued. This is an interim order
of short duration, normally ten days
from the date of issue, until the
defendants have an opportunity to
show cause why the TRO should not
become an injunction.
A temporary restraining order ceases
to be effective upon denial of a
preliminary injunction. If the
preliminary injunction is granted, the
TRO is superseded.

Therefore, if the named defendants
commit any act enjoined by the TRO,
they may be held in civil or criminal
contempt of court. If so held,
punishment may be imposed of a fine
of $500 or less or five days
imprisonment, or both. If civil
contempt proceedings are brought it is
true that the University will bear the
legal expenses, which could be quite
high.
But these expenses may be
minimized by joining a large number of
contemnors in one trial, alternatively if
criminal contempt is brought, the State
of California pays the cost of counsel.
With respect to the Doe defendants,
the rule is that a person may be guilty
of contempt of court if the University
names him as a defendant because of
his past acts, or if he acts in concern
with a named defendant in committing
enjoined acts. In addition, he must have
actual or constructive notice of the
provisions of the injunction.
A person would have actual notice if
he were personally served with a copy
of the injunction or if he appeared at
the hearing when the injunction was
granted. Constructive notice may be
given, for example, by placing the
injunction in the Dailv.
If a person enters into concert with
a defendant to commit any acts in
violation of the injunction he may be
found guilty of conspiracy to commit a
misdemeanor, which is a felony
punishable by imprisonment for not
less than six months.
Proceedings Available
In short, if a named defendant now
goes out and breaks a window, he may

be found guilty of violating the Campus
Policy on Disruptions, Malicious
Mischief, and contempt of court. If
the University learns the name of a
person who broke a window, they may
add him to the injunction as a
defendant. He is then also subject to
the above proceedings.
If the University never learns that a
person has broken a window and
therefore is never named as a
defendant, but the person acts in
concert with a named defendant, he is
also subject to the above proceedings.
Of course, the coust is free to liberally
interpret the terms "acting in concert"
and "aiding and abetting."
The significance of the TRO is that
the University now has an effective
immediate sanction available against
both students and nonstudents.
Previously, if a student trashed a
building, and his identity was known,
the University could initiate SJC
proceedings against him. A student or
nonstudent was only subject to
criminal sanctions if an officer could
testify that he saw him commit the act
and arrested him immediately.
Under TRO a contempt charge can
be brought on the testimony of anyone
who saw the act, not just an arresting
officer. In addition, certain nonstudent
disrupters can be excluded from
campus if they cannot show cause
Thursday morning why this provision
should not be invoked.
This prohibition of nonstudents
disrupters from coming on campus was
not included in a similar injunction
issued in May, 1969. President Lyman
was indicated that this prohibition is
one of the major purposes of the
present TRO.
Last Friday, attorneys for Stanford's
Board of Trustees obtained a
temporary restraining order (TRO) in
California Superior Court enjoining
Professor H. Bruce Franklin, 16 other
named defendants, the organization
Venceremos and up to 1000 "John
Does" from committing disruptive or
destructive acts. These acts include
painting, nailing, bricking, burning,
smashing, 'trashing'," occupying any
campus building or classroom for the
purpose and with the effect of
disrupting, or intentionally remaining
in a building after it has been officially
closed.
The TRO applies to all members of
Venceremos and its Central Committee.
In other words, if the Board of Trustees
can establish that a person is a member
of Venceremos or can establish to the
court's satisfaction that he is associated
with the revolutionary organization, he
may be the TRO.
John Does
In addition, the order applies to
1000 Does. California law allows
defendants to be served under fictitious
names if the Board of Trustees does not
know their names. However, the true
names must be added to the original
complaint before the order can
to them.
At a press conference yesterday,
President Lyman explained that the
additional defendants can be added
only by going back to the court with
specific evidence linking them to some
past events.
Hence, while the TRO mentions
1000 John Does, the actual number to
be added probably falls below that
total, because the TRO was not
designed to "create a net for scooping
