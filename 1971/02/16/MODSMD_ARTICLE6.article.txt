Allied forces have created a third front in
Indochina. Flagrantly violating international
law, disregarding public opinion, and under
cover of a five day news blackout, the U.S.
has supported a South Vietnamese push into
Laos.
Immediately following the massive
invasion, the State Department declared,
"this is not an enlargement of the war."
We do not believe our government.
Contrary to official notice, Nixon's latest
move will widen the war and prolong
American involvement. It has set the
precedent of South Vietnamese fighting in
Laos and threatens to embroil the entire
country in civil war.
Although the initial invasion is scheduled
to last five months, it may very well
continue indefinitely. Officials have already
pointed out that the real significance of the
invasion is not the temporary interdiction of
communist supply lines, but the precedent
of sending South Vietnamese troops into
Laos. If we have learned anything from the
invasion of Cambodia, it is that you cannot
shorten the war by extending the fighting.
"The aim of the drive," according to one
State Department official, "is to be sure we
haven't missed anything that would
endanger the withdrawal of U.S. troops."
This policy can be easily taken as a
blue-print for genocide on a massive scale. If
everything that could endanger American
withdrawal were to be killed, whole sections
of the population would be wiped out.
In no sense does the invasion serve the

interests of the people of Southeast Asia.
Nixon sees nothing wrong with sending
South Vietnamese to fight Laotians in order
to protect American lives. The implicit
racism, however, is certainly not lost on the
peasants who are bombed, starved, burned
and maimed under this policy.
The Southern Laotian panhandle has
always been a tempting target to the
military, but in the past the risks were
judged to be too great. Now, however,
Nixon has unleashed his generals and they
may have pushed the U.S. far deeper into
the Indochina quagmire than is immediately
obvious.
If the invasion is successful, limited gains
will be achieved-but at grave risk. China has
already threatened and may intervene if the
Ho Chi Minh trail is permanently severed.
If the invasion is not successful, Nixon's
entire plan of U.S. withdrawal may be
placed in jeopardy. The options then open
would be invasion of North Vietnam (which
appears more and more likely), use of
tactical nuclear weapons to create a buffer
zone, or withdrawal of all American forces,
followed probably by a communist victory
in all of Indochina.
The invasion is a dangerous escalation of
the war. We must fight this invasion, we
must fight the policies which underly the
invasion, and we must fight the government
which makes those policies. Until American
foreign policy in Indochina is changed, the
entire world, but especially the peoples of
Southeast Asia, will suffer the consequences.
