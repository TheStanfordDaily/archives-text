## Contradictions In Society 
### 
i Contrary to the image
projected by the U.S. State
Department, the Pather Lao, since
1955 officially the Neo Lao Hak
Sat (Laotian Patriotic Front), is
not an "alien" force in Laotian
society or a mere fabrication of
North Vietnam. In fact, the
Pathet Lao is an indigenous and
developed revolutionary
movement within Laos, which has
introduced radical change in
Laotian society and has organized
an effective military force.
While American officials speak
of "reducing Laos to zero"
destroying the very fabric of the
society-the Pathet Lao has built
upon traditional culture, both the
Lao and of the minority tribes,
respecting rather than destroying
the cultural identity of the various
Laotian peoples. Unlike the Royal
Lao Government (RLG), which
includes and represents only the
Lao elite (with the exception of
Vang Pao and Touby Lyfong of
the CIA Meo mercenary army.)
and assumed a racist Lao attitude
toward minorities, the Pathet Lao
has forged a relatively egalitarian
unity of the divergent ethnic
groups, including the Lao
peasants.
While the U.S. and the Lao
elite are using State power to
preserve the status quo within
society and to counter insurgency,
the Pathet Lao in fighting both a
civil and anti-U.S. war, has
organized a Revolutionary
government and is leading the
people in transforming their
society. Phoumi Vongvichit,
Secretary-General of the Central
Committee of the Neo Lao Hak
Sat, and probably the Party's
major theorist, has outlined the
general theory of the Pathet Lao,
which form the basis of the Pathet
Lao practice.
Vongvichit explains that the

Laotian struggle has two main
components: on the one hand it is
both civil war and war against the
U.S.; on the other hand, it is a
democratic social revolution with
the interrelated problems of
creating a sense of nationalist
identification among the various
minority groups, and of radically
transforming the culture of the
different groups in order to
achieve new social goals and to
make the nationalist struggle
possible.
The Laotian civil war,
Vongvichit explains, is primarily a
struggle against the "bureaucratic
comprador bourgeoisie." This
class includes administrative
bureaucrats, army officers, and
capitalists who profiteer from
U.S. aid. The only basis of
finalcial support for these people
is American subsidization of the
government and economy.
Secondarily, the struggle is
against the Laotian "feudal" class,
which in Vongvichit's words is a
"lingering" though less powerful
force than the bourgeoisis, and
exploits the peasants mainly
through such forms as "land rent,
buffalo rent, usurious rates of
interest and other dues and
tributes." These feudal forces are
holding back the progress of the
society, although they have been
generally, but not completely,
abolished in the liberated zones.
According to Vongvichit, as
long as the bourgeois class, and to
a lesser extent the feudal class,
continues to exist, the U.S. "will
have at their disposal a support
for their aggressive designs, (and)
the State cannot be really
independent... Therefore, the
Party considers it an absolute
necessity for the whole Lao
national-democratic revolution at
the present stage to overthrow the

banning garrett

bureaucratic comprador
bourgeoisie and abolish its
privileges and prerogatives."
The other side of the
contradictions within Laotian
society is the cultural
parochialism and technical
backwardness of the people. In a
very critical assessment of the
stiuation, Vongvichit explains:
"Laos has a backward economy
and culture as a result of fetters
imposed by the feudal and
colonial regimes for entire
generations ... Backward customs
and habits and superstitions still
prevail particularly in ethnic
minority areas . .. The Lao
laborer works very hard but his
productivity does not increase and
his livelihood is precarious. Such
is the lot of the Lao citizen even
in areas where colonial and feudal
oppression and exploitation have
been abolished."
