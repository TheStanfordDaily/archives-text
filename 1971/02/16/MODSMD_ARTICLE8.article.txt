# Nixon Doctrine Basis For Indochinese Policy
## 
### 
The buildup of South
Vietnamese strength and
concomitant reduction of U.S.
forces in Vietnam fall in line with
the strategy of the so-called Nixon
doctrine, set forth by the
President at Guam in July, 1969,
and restated on Nov. 3, 1969, as
follows (N.Y. Times, Nov. 4,
1959 ): "First, the United States
vill keep its treaty commitments.
Second, we shall provide a shield
if a nuclear power threatens the
■

freedom of a nation allied with us,
or of a nation whose survival we
consider vital to our security.
Third, in cases involving other
types of aggression we shall
furnish military and economic
assistance when requested in
accordance with our treaty
commitments. But we shall look
to the nation directly threatened
to assume the primary
responsibility of providing the
manpower for its defense."
Two important documents
afford insight into Nixon's
thinking on U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia. The first is an
article by him in Foreign Affairs,
October, 1967; the second is the
State of the Union message on
foreign policy of February, 1970
(N.Y. Times, Feb. 19, 19 70,
especially pp. 22 -23 ). Nixon has
tried to implement his proposals
made in 1 967: 1 ) qualified
withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Vietnam and elsewhere in the
world, based on his recognition of
the growing unacceptability to the
American people of continued
large-scale U.S. military presence
in Vietnam and other "trouble
spots"; 2) contributing to the
military and economic power of
"friendly" nations, and forming
regional defense alliances with
these nations, with the purpose of
combatting aggression and/or
insurgency against these nations
using indigenous ground troops
augmented, where necessary, by
American naval and air forces.
The Nixon administration's
course can be altered by bringing
to bear sufficiently vigorous and
sustained public pressure. But the
administration is likely to resist
strongly any attempt to force it
into more rapid withdrawal of
U.S. forces from Indochina, for
this would incur a grave risk that
the Saigon regime's forces and
control would swiftly and
irreversibly disintegrate. This is an
eventuality which the Nixon
administration riM ' ioUlly
'ii'i". i ,)Lible.

In the military sphere, the
Nixon administration has given
repeated evidence of its
determination to salvage the
American investment in South
Vietnam, even at the expense of
1) probably destroying by
invasion Cambodia's long-term
hopes for independence, 2)
delivering, via the present
invasion, a severe blow to the
precarious hope for re-establishing
a neutral coalition government in
Laos, 3) continuing the massive
U.S. bombing of eastern Laos, and
4) continuing military operations
in South Vietnam which hardly
reflect the long term needs and
desires of the South Vietnamese
people.
It is highly probable that
within a year or two the
diminished level of U.S. forces in
Vietnam will expose the
deep-reaching instability of the
Saigon regime. That is the time
(likely after the 1972 elections)
when the administration will be
forced to make the decision
whether or not to re-intensify the
application of U.S. military force
in Indochina to the extent needed
to shore up the Saigon regime
from otherwise certain
disintegration, the time when the
President and his administration
will be most vulnerable to a
determined campaign of public
expressions and demonstrations
by the American people.
Given the administration's
obvious determination not to be
deflected from its chosen course
in Indochina, and its adriotness at
diffusing the effects of domestic
opposition to the war, it is
unlikely that sufficient political
force can be mobilized during
1971 to effect a basic change in
U.S. policy. But the necessity for
starting a campaign for that
purpose, and building it over a
long time, is pressing now, if we
are not to allow ourselves to be
buried gradually by the press of
evnts.

In the military sphere, the
Nixon administration has given
repeated evidence of its
determination to salvage the
American investment in South
Vietnam, even at the expense of
1) probably destroying by
invasion Cambodia's long-term
hopes for independence, 2)
delivering, via the present
invasion, a severe blow to the
precarious hope for re-establishing
a neutral coalition government in
Laos, 3) continuing the massive
U.S. bombing of eastern Laos, and
4) continuing military operations
in South Vietnam which hardly
reflect the long term needs and
desires of the South Vietnamese
people.
It is highly probable that
within a year or two the
diminished level of U.S. forces in
Vietnam will expose the
deep-reaching instability of the
Saigon regime. That is the time
(likely after the 1972 elections)
when the administration will be
forced to make the decision
whether or not to re-intensify the
application of U.S. military force
in Indochina to the extent needed
to shore up the Saigon regime
from otherwise certain
disintegration, the time when the
President and his administration
will be most vulnerable to a
determined campaign of public
expressions and demonstrations
by the American people.
Given the administration's
obvious determination not to be
deflected from its chosen course
in Indochina, and its adriotness at
diffusing the effects of domestic
opposition to the war, it is
unlikely that sufficient political
force can be mobilized during
1971 to effect a basic change in
U.S. policy. But the necessity for
starting a campaign for that
purpose, and building it over a
long time, is pressing now, if we
are not to allow ourselves to be
buried gradually by the press of
evnts.
The buildup of South
Vietnamese strength and
concomitant reduction of U.S.
forces in Vietnam fall in line with
the strategy of the so-called Nixon
doctrine, set forth by the
President at Guam in July, 1969,
and restated on Nov. 3, 1969, as
follows (N.Y. Times, Nov. 4,
1959 ): "First, the United States
vill keep its treaty commitments.
Second, we shall provide a shield
if a nuclear power threatens the
■

freedom of a nation allied with us,
or of a nation whose survival we
consider vital to our security.
Third, in cases involving other
types of aggression we shall
furnish military and economic
assistance when requested in
accordance with our treaty
commitments. But we shall look
to the nation directly threatened
to assume the primary
responsibility of providing the
manpower for its defense."
Two important documents
afford insight into Nixon's
thinking on U.S. involvement in
Southeast Asia. The first is an
article by him in Foreign Affairs,
October, 1967; the second is the
State of the Union message on
foreign policy of February, 1970
(N.Y. Times, Feb. 19, 19 70,
especially pp. 22 -23 ). Nixon has
tried to implement his proposals
made in 1 967: 1 ) qualified
withdrawal of U.S. forces from
Vietnam and elsewhere in the
world, based on his recognition of
the growing unacceptability to the
American people of continued
large-scale U.S. military presence
in Vietnam and other "trouble
spots"; 2) contributing to the
military and economic power of
"friendly" nations, and forming
regional defense alliances with
these nations, with the purpose of
combatting aggression and/or
insurgency against these nations
using indigenous ground troops
augmented, where necessary, by
American naval and air forces.
The Nixon administration's
course can be altered by bringing
to bear sufficiently vigorous and
sustained public pressure. But the
administration is likely to resist
strongly any attempt to force it
into more rapid withdrawal of
U.S. forces from Indochina, for
this would incur a grave risk that
the Saigon regime's forces and
control would swiftly and
irreversibly disintegrate. This is an
