The Geneva accords of 1954,
as they pertained to Laos, were
remarkable only for their lack of
clarity; only the provisions that
declared Laos to be a neutral state
(articles four and five) were
unambiguous. Yet, even these
provisions failed to endure.
In September 1954 the SEATO
members, meeting in Manila,
violated the spirit of the accords
when they brought Laos into their
"protective orbit." Immediately,
Lao politics was polarized
between forces that wanted a
neutral coalition government
(incorporating the Pathet Lao)
and those who wanted an
American funded, pro-western,
exclusive regime (excluding the
Pathet Lao).
In order to secure this stake,
Washington tried to undermine
every attempt by the neutral
forces to integrate the Pathet Lao
into the government. For
example, when Souvanna Phouma
emerged as head of the Royal Lao
Government in 195 7 and held
general elections on May 4, 1958,
the Pathet Lao political party won
9 of the 23 seats. As soon as the
election results were released the
right-wing attacked Souvanna as
"soft on communism." "In any
event, the United States
government reached a decision to
hold up its monthly payment to
the Lao government.. ."
(Hilsman). The direct result was
Souvanna's ouster and Phoui
Sananikone's assumption of both
power and , "pro-western
neutralism."
This pro-western orientation
survived Phoui's overthrow (Dec.
31, 1959) and the installation of
Kou Abhay; the new regime held
elections in April 1960. "The
government, however,
controlled the tabulations and,
according to the final totals, the

Pathet Lao candidates were
defeated by a landslide"
(Hilsman). After the elections,
General Phoumi Nosavan formed
a rightist, pro-western,
government only to be
overthrown in August 1960 by
the neutralist Kong Le who made
Souvanna Phouma prime minister
once again. At this juncture, the
U.S. government agreed to
recognize the Kong-Souvanna
government if Washington could
continue to give arms to General
Phoumi Nosavan; to no one's
surprise, when Phoumi had
sufficient strength (Dec. 1960) he
turned these arms on the
neutralist regime and drove it
from Vientiane to the Plaine des
Jars and into the arms of the
Pathet Lao.

By mid 1962, after Kennedy
had assumed office, a temporary
lull in the fighting was engineered
and the 1962 Geneva Agreements
covering Laos were signed; once
again, Souvanna Phouma was
prime minister.
The 1962 Geneva accords,
however, were to fall victim to
U.S. pressure. By September and
October 1962 the Vientiane
coalition government was coming
apart over the issue of continuing
Air America flights to the Meo
tribesmen (18,000 troops) who
were fighting the Pathet Lao in
Eastern Laos. In addition to
Souvanna's support of these
actions, the Prime Minister moved
further to the right by going to
the rightist National Assembly
(neither the neutralists nor the

Pathet Lao recognized this body
as legitimate) to obtain power to
rule alone for one year.
Throughout 1964 and 1965
the U.S. increased its training and
supplying of Lao and Thai
mercenaries to fight the Pathet
Lao (Porter). As the situation in
Vietnam became more serious for
Washington, the trails through the
Pathet Lao zones in eastern Laos
assumed increasing importance. In
July 1964 the U.S. began
bombing Laos. Since November
1968, with the bombing pause
over North Vietnam, the
destruction of eastern Laos has
continually increased; today
approximately 1 ,500 sorties per
week are flown and over 7 0 0,0 0 0
persons are refugees out of a
population of only two million

government only to be
overthrown in August 1960 by
the neutralist Kong Le who made
Souvanna Phouma prime minister
once again. At this juncture, the
U.S. government agreed to
recognize the Kong-Souvanna
government if Washington could
continue to give arms to General
Phoumi Nosavan; to no one's
surprise, when Phoumi had
sufficient strength (Dec. 1960) he
turned these arms on the
neutralist regime and drove it
from Vientiane to the Plaine des
Jars and into the arms of the
Pathet Lao.

By mid 1962, after Kennedy
had assumed office, a temporary
lull in the fighting was engineered
and the 1962 Geneva Agreements
covering Laos were signed; once
again, Souvanna Phouma was
prime minister.
The 1962 Geneva accords,
however, were to fall victim to
U.S. pressure. By September and
October 1962 the Vientiane
coalition government was coming
apart over the issue of continuing
Air America flights to the Meo
tribesmen (18,000 troops) who
were fighting the Pathet Lao in
Eastern Laos. In addition to
Souvanna's support of these
actions, the Prime Minister moved
further to the right by going to
the rightist National Assembly
(neither the neutralists nor the

Pathet Lao recognized this body
as legitimate) to obtain power to
rule alone for one year.
Throughout 1964 and 1965
the U.S. increased its training and
supplying of Lao and Thai
mercenaries to fight the Pathet
Lao (Porter). As the situation in
Vietnam became more serious for
Washington, the trails through the
Pathet Lao zones in eastern Laos
assumed increasing importance. In
July 1964 the U.S. began
bombing Laos. Since November
1968, with the bombing pause
over North Vietnam, the
destruction of eastern Laos has
continually increased; today
approximately 1 ,500 sorties per
week are flown and over 7 0 0,0 0 0
persons are refugees out of a
population of only two million

The Geneva accords of 1954,
as they pertained to Laos, were
remarkable only for their lack of
clarity; only the provisions that
declared Laos to be a neutral state
(articles four and five) were
unambiguous. Yet, even these
provisions failed to endure.
In September 1954 the SEATO
members, meeting in Manila,
violated the spirit of the accords
when they brought Laos into their
"protective orbit." Immediately,
Lao politics was polarized
between forces that wanted a
neutral coalition government
(incorporating the Pathet Lao)
and those who wanted an
American funded, pro-western,
exclusive regime (excluding the
Pathet Lao).
In order to secure this stake,
Washington tried to undermine
every attempt by the neutral
forces to integrate the Pathet Lao
into the government. For
example, when Souvanna Phouma
emerged as head of the Royal Lao
Government in 195 7 and held
general elections on May 4, 1958,
the Pathet Lao political party won
9 of the 23 seats. As soon as the
election results were released the
right-wing attacked Souvanna as
"soft on communism." "In any
event, the United States
government reached a decision to
hold up its monthly payment to
the Lao government.. ."
(Hilsman). The direct result was
Souvanna's ouster and Phoui
Sananikone's assumption of both
power and , "pro-western
neutralism."
This pro-western orientation
survived Phoui's overthrow (Dec.
31, 1959) and the installation of
Kou Abhay; the new regime held
elections in April 1960. "The
government, however,
controlled the tabulations and,
according to the final totals, the

Pathet Lao candidates were
defeated by a landslide"
(Hilsman). After the elections,
General Phoumi Nosavan formed
a rightist, pro-western,
government only to be
overthrown in August 1960 by
