BIRDCALLS
v, BURGERS
Our mighty Wurlitzer imitates the zaniest sounds: sirens, tam
bourines, steamboat whistles, hoofbeats, etc. And organ buff
manager, Steve Restivo, just keeps right on adding other sound
devices.
One sound our jolly gold giant can't imitate is beer flowing
from the tap or wine being sipped. Great with our pizza,
spaghetti, ravioli, salads, etc. Silent flickers nightly.
