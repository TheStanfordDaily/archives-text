# News Service Chief Enjoys Action
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
"I don't mind being called a
publicist, I don't mind being called a
flack," says Bob Beyers, who also
doesn't really mind his campus
nickname, Bob Bias.
"My roommate used to call me bias
at Cornell," he explains; "When I got to
Stanford, someone made a pun on my
name, and I told them that was already
my nickname."
A lot of people have used that name
in recent years. In his role as director of
News and Publications, Bob Beyers has
had his share of notoriety in covering
the often confusing events on campus.
Name calling is but one of his job's
fringe benefits. Having notes stolen
while covering demonstrations is
another. Sometimes, his job is even
more demanding. "During the S.R.I,
demonstrations two years ago," he
recalls, "I was watching the police
sweep through some demonstrators,
and I looked over at some
demonstrators who were pretty remote.
I turned around, and a brick came
sailing by my head."
'Sleeping Bag Six'
Last spring was less dangerous,
though still rugged. When Encina Hall
was blockaded following the
Cambodian invasion, he and five other
members of the News and Pub staff
spent several days holed up in their
offices on the third floor. "They'd
come around at six and leave at four,"
he recalls, "So we'd go out, get
something to eat, take a shower, go
back, and stay in overnight."
The exploits of the sleeping bag six,
as they called themselves, and other
News and Publications people in times
of crises are but the tip of an iceberg.
Of the 1 200 news releases issued last
year, most have little or nothing to do
with campus politics or crises. The
exploits of Stanford researchers or the
speeches of on-campus speakers are

common grist for the News Service
mill.
Other Jobs
These releases are not the only News
Service enterprise. The office produces
the weekly Campus Report, the
monthly Stanford Observer, and the
monthly Education Digest. While the
first publication is limited to the
campus, both the Observor and the
Digest reach off campus audiences of
alumni, parents, and educators.
Some of the News Service output
goes beyond the realm of basic public
relations. Notes Beyers, "The material
we have also gets mailed on a selective
basis internally. For instance, business
school professors who want can get
business stories. If a speaker comes
along and gives an analysis of U.S.
overseas investments, and says it's
imperialism, or says it's developing
underdeveloped countries, that would
go to the business school faculty."
Office Objectivity
This attitude concentrating on the
objective transmission of information -
underlies Beyers' conception of his job.
"We're like a wire service" hesayd. "If
a wire service shows some consistent
bias, it's going to hear about it from it's
clients; I think the same thing would be
true in our case."
Not all would agree with his
analysis; yet he professes to enjoy
"getting a minority or unpopular point
of view up to the point where it gets a
fair hearing." His story suggestions have
come from all sides.
"Last year, when Banning Garrett
came by two days before the
Cambodian invasion and predicted it
would happen, we put out a story and
moved it on the business wire," he
recalls. "Nobody bought it, but we
can't force anyone to run anything."
His critics concede that the News
Service does attempt to construct an
objective view of events. A member of

the Chapparai staff says, "He's a
corporate liberal, and as such tries in
his way to be fair. I enjoy arguing with
him; he always argues from the basis of
lots of information."
Says Chris Hocker of the Arena, "I
don't think Beyers and the Press
Service are unfair as much as they are
shallow. They just don't have the desire
to pursue an event with any depth. I've
read some pretty inane releases put out
by him that showed a reliance on the
superficial and a lack of investigation.
This doesn't happen all the time, but
more often than it should."
Beyers himself appears to have no

qualms about being a publicist. "The
justification for something like this,
like any other bureaucratic function, is
that it's got to be one that does a job
better, faster, and cheaper than some
alternative arrangement." He assumes
the job to be a necessary part of a
contemporary university structure.
Biased or not, he likes his job; his
damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don't
position agrees with him. After ten
years in Encina, working with News
and Publications, he seems ready for
another decade. He says,"I like to be
wherever the news is breaking." If he
didn't he wouldn't be there.
