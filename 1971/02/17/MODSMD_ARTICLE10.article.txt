# SJC Decision Nears

### JON DEDMON 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has announced no decision in the
controversial Lodge case, but SJC
Chairman Howard Williams said last
night that he hoped a decision would
be rendered "within the next 4 8 or 7 2
hours."
The Council met for one hour
yesterday to hear Assistant to the
Provost John Schwartz make his closing
arguments and recommend penalties
against the seven students charged with
disrupting Henry Cabot Lodge's speech
here January 11.
The recommended penalties were as
follows: four quarters suspension with
two quarters stayed for defendants
Brad Dowden, Gerry Foote, Merle
Rabine, and Theresa Ramirez; four
quarters suspension with one stayed for
defendants Michael Holman and Jeff
Youdelman; and four quarters
suspension with none stayed for
defendant Janet Weiss.
In recommending varying penalties
for the defendants Schwartz stated that
defendants Holman and Youdelman
had been found guilty of disrupting an
Academic Council meeting last spring,

while Weiss had been found guilty both
of disrupting the Academic Council
meeting and an ROTC class last spring.
In recommending the penalties
Schwartz concluded, "The SJC owes
such sanctions to the Stanford
community, the thousands of students
who came here to learn by listening to
others. We cannot go on year after year
hoping that moral pronouncements will
dissuade those bent on destroying
Stanford as an institution of free
inquiry."
