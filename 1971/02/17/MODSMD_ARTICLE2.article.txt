# Blacks Stage Ugli Book-In
## 
### 
Approximately 75 black students
staged a "book-in" last night in Meyer
Undergraduate Library, piling over
1000 books on the check-out counter
shortly before the library closed.
The incident occurred after the one
week deadline set by the Black
Students Union (BSU) at a rally last
Tuesday at which 10 demands were
made of the University passed
apparently without any official
response from officials.

Four campus policemen were
summoned by library officials, but
arrived to late to stop the group which
marched off into the adjacent
dormitory area.
Police cleared the library slightly
before the usual midnight closing time.
The library staff began to clean up the
books piled on and around the
checkout counter and strewn about one
section on the fourth floor.
No estimate of damage, if any, was
available.
