# In Peaceful Protests
## 1000 March Against Asian War 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Nearly 1 000 people marched into
Palo Alto yesterday to protest the
invasion of Laos and the Indochina
War. After winding through downtown
Palo Alto, the non-violent noon march
ended with a rally at El Camino Park.
At the rally, a depleted crowd of
marchers listened to speakers including
Sanford Dornbusch, B. Davie Napier
and Father John Duryea, who spoke
out against the war.
The march started shortly after
noon in front of and headed
down Palm Drive towards Palo Alto. As
the crowd crossed into Palo Alto, it had
swelled to near the 1000 mark.
The marchers were primarily
Stanford students with many professors
and a few community people including
President Lyman's wife, Jing. As the
crowd crossed El Camino Real, they
were joined by ten primarily elderly
women from the International League
of Women for Peace and Freedom.
Many people watched from the
sidewalk or from inside businesses as
the marched moved down University
Avenue. Some expressed support for
the march.
"I'm with you, but I have to go to
work."
"My son's out there marching and I
think it is a good way to show
resentment towards what the
government is doing."
A woman from Allen Learning
Systems said that many of her fellow
women employees would be marching
if they could. "I'm in favor of this.
Many of us would be marching if we
had the time and could get away from
our work."
A male employee from Rapp's Shoe
Store said he was much closer to
marches like this than he had been six
months ago. "It's a good, beautiful
protest. People are moving a little
closer to things like this, especially
since the ridiculous thing in Laos
happened. Six months ago, I'd never
thought I'd look at it this way."
But there were non-supporters as
well. "I don't think the people I work
with would march."

"I don't support it. They're picking
on a lot of our customers."
Few if any of the verbal supporters
actually joined the march. By the time
it reached El Camino Park, the crowd
had thinned out to around 600 people.
"Rise Up!"
At the rally, Earl Martin, a graduate
student in East Asian Studies, called for
people "to rise up in the streets, rise up
in their businesses, and rise up in their
schools. We will rise and refuse to be
silenced."
Jean Hobson from the Palo Alto
Tenants Union talked about the
"complicity of Stanford and the
Midpeninsula in the war effort. She
talked specifically about Stanford
Research Institute, the Stanford
Industrial Park and the Stanford
Computation Center.
"We are here to expose the criminal
war research done at Stanford and in
Palo Alto. We are here to expose the
complicity of Stanford University in
perpetuating and widening this war.
There is laser research being done in the
Physics Department and

counter-insurgency research being done
in the Social Science departments.
"Students must follow the
leadership of Third World People. They
must protest the war in Indochina and
call for an end to that war.
Venceremos!"
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the
Stanford Chapel, then spoke about how
the "violence of injustice can
ultimately be overcome by
non-violence of compassion and love.
But love must be genuine and show
itself in action."
Finally Dornbusch, chairman of the
faculty senate, talked about groups
through which people could carry on
"the fight against this evil war." He
mentioned many alternate groups
through which people could do work of
various types.
Among those groups mentioned and
represented at the rally were: The
Business Executives Move for Peace in
Vietnam, Concerned Asian Scholars,
Stanford Medical Community for
Peace, Peace Union, Committee for
Supplies to Indochina, Friends

Committee on National Legislation and
the Concerned Citizens Peace Center.
The rally broke up around 2 :00 p.m.
as people split up into separate groups
to plan future actions. Canvassing,
petitioning and other community
actions had all been planned, and many
of those at the rally volunteered to
work in these areas.
Frustration Voiced
But as they headed home, many of
the demonstrators felt a bit frustrated
as to how much good the march had
done and how much good these future
actions could do.
"It gets pretty monotonous, doing
this, and you get quite frustrated. 1 still
get satisfaction out of voicing
disapproval of the war. It is still
important to keep the community
stirred up. But I don't have much faith
in it."
This seemed to be the mood of
many of the participants. One of the
organizers, Larry Diamond, also had an
opinion of what had happened.
"I'm very unhappy with the turnout,

U.S.—backed invasion of Laos by South Vietnamese troops.
but the march was still important.
Stanford has 1 2,000 students, many of
whom are deeply opposed to the
Laotian invasion. Where were they?"
"I'm getting pretty depressed. I've
been through this many times and
nothing has really worked. In 1969, the
Moratorium was a new and fresh idea,
and that was one reason why so many
people turned out for it. It hasn't really
worked since them."

So the people with their leaflets and
canvassing packets headed back to their
dorms and living units. There was a
little hope, a little optimism, but a lot
of depression. For after all the marches
and leafletting and canvassing, the war
still goes on.

There will be a community meeting
in Mem Aud tonight at 7 :00 to discuss
University complicity in the war effort
and land use policy.
