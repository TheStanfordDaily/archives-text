# Prof. Franklin Ignores Suspension As Overflow Crowd Attends Class
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Professor Bruce Franklin ignored his
suspension yesterday to teach his
English class on "Literature in the
1930'5." An overflowing crowd in an
Engineering Corner classroom heard
Franklin lead a combination literary
critique and political rally.
The Maoist professor was suspended
with pay by President Lyman on
Friday, pending hearings on Lyman's
request for his dismissal. The actions
were based on Franklin's alleged
"important role" in recent campus
disruptions.
The class hour seemed to be based

on Franklin's belief that "there is no
distinction between art and
propaganda." He moved smoothly from
critiques of revolutionary literature to
comments on radical action on campus
before an attentive audience of about
25 0. Registration for the class is about
150.
"I feel a political, moral, and even
legal responsibility to go on teaching
this class," Franklin said.
Will Teach Again
He pledged to teach the 1 :15 course
again today, and "Thursday we will be
meeting unless it becomes actually
criminal for me to be on this campus."

Franklin will be among those barred
from campus after tomorrow if the
court grants a preliminary injunction
requested by the University.
Franklin said he would not disobey
such an injunction because he already
has "other felony charges outstanding."
English Department Chairman lan
Watt said Franklin's lecture did not
violate his suspension because it was
not an "official class session."
Officially, the class meetings have been
called off for the time being, and
students were advised to "use the time
to continue with reading for the
course."
Credit for Course
In an English Department
announcement handed out before the
lecture, Franklin's students were
assured they will receive credit for the
course if they complete the
assignments. Five professors were
named by the Department as advisers,
"jointly responsible for the course"
during Franklin's suspension.
Before yesterday's lecture, the
packed classroom looked like a busy
radical meeting. Vendors sold buttons
for Venceremos, the radical group of
whose Central Committee Franklin is a
member. A revolutionary poster was
taped to the blackboard.
Once Franklin began there was the
quiet atmosphere of most classrooms,
interrupted only by occasional applause
and shouts of "right on."
Franklin described his situation as
the "first time an American university
has tried to repress a tenured professor
on political grounds."
"They're not going to stop us from
talking," he added. "We won't be in
classrooms anymore, but that's OK."
Franklin then turned to the assigned
reading, Edgar Snow's Red Star Over
China. The 1937 book is a sympathetic
account of life in Communist China.
Franklin said such "proletarian
literature" is "systematically excluded"
from most English courses.
Study of Reactionaries
Instead, William Faulkner, Ezra
Pound, T.S. Elliot, "and other
reactionaries like that" are normally
studied. He said these writers were
trapped by their insane visions of
what they imagine social reality to be."
Appearing relaxed, dressed in
shirtsleeves and wearing a Venceremos
button, Franklin read an excerpt from
Snow's book. It described a Chinese
guerilla theater performance.
Franklin said the politically-oriented
play showed there is "no distinction
between art and propaganda."
He commented that political slogans
painted on walls can be called illegal or
praised as revolutionary art. "Thus a
political question comes down to an
aesthetic question â€” how do you
decorate your environment?"
At the end of his lecture, Franklin
said, "The ideas in this class are not
going to be repressed. These ideas can't
be destroyed."
