# Budget Woes Trouble Private Universities

Since the inception of the Budget Adjustment
Program here at Stanford, many department heads
have lived in fear of being "BAPed," â€” having
their budgets cut. While nothing can immediately
relieve the University's financial problems it is
perhaps reasuring to learn that many, if not most,
of the other private colleges and universities in the
country are facing money shortages and Stanford
is by far not the worst off.
Columbia University, for example, has had five
consecutive years of budget deficit with a very red
$11 million in 1 970 and perhapsan even reddersls
million expected for this year. The Cornell Alumni
News said that the money shortage even out-ranks
student dissent ss the major problem facing higher
education in the 70's.
Most college presidents agree with the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Kdueation that this is the
worst financial crisis ever in the 300-year history
of American higher education. American
University's president (leorge 11. Williams said that
"It may be in the next ten years that private
higher education will be a thing of the past."
The list of causes for this problem goes on
forever and is different for each institution but

they all resolve into the fact that costs are rising at
an increasing rate while income is rising at a
decreasing rate.
Since 1 965 the cost of college nation-wide has
gone up by 70%, from $15.2 billion to $26.1
billion. But the student population, a major source
of income, has increased only 38%.
This has caused most colleges to rely more
heavily on government money and returns from
investments as well as alumni support. Recently
these three sources have contracted. The stock
market has been low and federal aid to higher
education has not kept pace with need.
Inflation on Hurts
Inflation has done its part to force college
presidents into early retirement. It has not only
made it more difficult for alumni to make their
contributions but it has also made materials cost
more. At Princeton the number of alumni giving
dropped i% last year and their donations dropped
by half a million dollars, In this case there were
other reasons for decreased alumni support, such
as the school's move toward co-education.
Alumni and business nationwide have seen
universities as bad investments due to campus
unrest. Campus demonstrations, in turn, have
added their own cost more directly in the form of

destruction, increased security, and higher
insurance rates. At Berkeley campus insurance
rates have virtually tripled in recent years.
Salaries, which are close to of operating
expenses, have also risen. From 1 959 to 1969 the
average professor's salary at the University of
Chicago has jumped 100%. More special programs
in the wake of increased social awareness have also
burdened the nation's colleges. And there has been
a greater demand for scholarships and student aid
in an attempt to bring the under privileged into
the schools.
These programs have taken their toll. The
president of New York University estimated that
half his university's unmet needs resulted from
scholarships and special program for blacks. NYU
faces a $4 .5 million deficit even after cutting their
budget by five million dollars.
The Carnegie Commission estimated that two
thirds of the nation's institutions were either in
financial trouble or headed for it. Carl Franklin, a
vice-president of USC, wasn't bragging when he
said, "As far as 1 can tell USC is the only major
private university not to have a deficit, but how
long we can keep up remains to be seen."
The Association of American Colleges made a
survey of the last four years that showed a total
nationwide deficit of $3 70 million for all the

nation's institutions. In the last two years 21
colleges and universities have given up and closed
their doors. Those schools that seem to have had
the easiest time are the small institutions in the
South.
Teaching Without Pay
John F. Kennedy College in Wahoo, Nebraska is
a good example of the lengths to which some
schools must go to stay solvent. The teachers there
went a full quarter without pay and then went on
with only 60% of their previous salary. Other
solutions have ranged from budget adjustment like
Stanford to student solicitation for funds. Again at
JFK College some students worked during the
summer and gave what they made to the school.
At Duquesne two thousand students raised money
with a $45 a plate dinner, a raffle, and a march.
Most schools have, or rather had, a reserve fund
from which to draw. When this money is gone
other measures must follow. Some schools have
had to use part of their endowment. Yale has
frozen all hiring and Columbia cut out its whole
Theater Arts Department. Most schools have had
to cut their student aid programs and this
especially hurts the low income and minority
students. Princeton cul its graduate acceptances by
2.VY and Cal Tech cut their urad school bv 20 'V.
