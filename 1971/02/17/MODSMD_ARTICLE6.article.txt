statement
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have not yet had time to
consult all my colleagues, but I
have consulted a good many, and
I believe I speak for most
members of the English
Department Faculty in saying:
1. The various circumstances
which have led to President
Lyman's immediate suspension of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin from
professorial duties, and to the
initiation of dismissal proceedings
against him, were not within our
control. We personally regret that
we now must face the possibility
of losing a colleague and a gifted

scholar and teacher whose
approach to literature, though not
wholly shared by any of us,
certainly deserves a hearing.
2. As the English Department
Faculty we cannot and do not
take any position as to the charges
against Professor Franklin,
because they affect both him and
us not as members of the
Department but as members of
the University.

3. Students in Professor
Franklin's courses need feel no
anxiety as to their current
academic programs. During the
present suspension the English
Faculty will make interim
arrangements as soon as possible
for the continuance of Professor
Franklin's courses, since the
English Faculty, on behalf of the
Academic Council, is charged with
responsibility for instruction in
the Department.
4. We appeal to all who teach
in the Department to honor their
obligations to their classes. We
further appeal to all members of
the Department teachers and
students alike, to act with
responsibility and restraint in the
difficult days ahead.
5. We give unqualified support
to the traditions of freedom of
speech, of teaching, and of
research, which seem to us to be
the essential intellectual and
moral bases of any university;and

we utterly repudiate violence on
campus, since it will only weaken
the University internally and
externally, without, in our view,
hastening the end of killing in
Indo-China.

Jem denial
Editor, THE DAILY:
1 wish to deny categorically the
allegations made by Mrs. Jeannie
Dolly in which she accuses an
FCM member of using a nightstick
and mace on her and another
person. No member of the FCM
has ever gone into a situation such
as the riot of Wednesday night
with more than a camera and a
flashlight. No member of FCM has
ever carried a can of mace, dog
repellent, insecticide, hairspray,
deodorant, or any eye irritant into
such a situation, much less used it.

It might be remembered by some
that, between the bullets and the
beatings, FCM had enough of its
own trouble Wednesday night
without macing random
individuals.
The explanation for the
charges made by Mrs. Dolly, a
non-student, a Free You staff
member, and a chronic
FCM-baiter, are as follows: 1) The
incident she records never
happened; or 2) it happened, but
was perpetrated by other than
FCM members. This last
possibility took place last year,
when FCM was blamed for actions
that were the work of off-duty
police officers, dressed in plain
clothes, who sprayed an irritating
substance more or less randomly
on individuals. FCM does not
dondone such actions for reasons
both humanitarian and tactical.
Mrs. Dolly and others who
harbor varying degrees of paranoia
toward FCM members may be
reassured to know that no FCM'er
will appear in public without first
cutting his claws to a reasonable
length, filing his teeth down to no
more than two inches, and shaving
the coarse black hair from his
feet, ankles, neck, and forehead.

clear message
Editor, THE DAILY:
Once more there is an attempt
to silence a gadfly who tries to
wake up a sluggish beast to the
dark realities around. And once
again the focus of attention may
slip from that message of dark
reality to the confrontation
between gadfly and opponent, or
even worse to the personalities
themselves.
The message is as clear as it is
disturbing: the U.S. is involved in
yet further crimes against the
people of Southeast Asia. Bruce
Franklin and others like him will
not allow us to ignore it and, like
the sluggish beast we are, to fall
back to sleep. And the response of
our Protector, Richard Lyman, is
to ignore the message and to swat
the fly. For, as we know, a roused
beast may break a few windows!
Against the background of
what occurs daily in Southeast
Asia and in the light of Stanford's
own complicity, the action of the
administration against Franklin
and others seems at best absurd
and at least contemptible. But
Franklin exposed these character
traits long ago and he certainly
must have expected some such
action sooner or later.
There is a tale (told by the
philosopher Kierkegaard) of a
clown who went on stage to tell
an audience that the theatre was
on fire. The audience was
entertained, clapped, and finally
burned to death. If Richard
Lyman were in that theatre, it is
doubtful that he would be
entertained. He would more likely
issue an injunction against the
clown!
We are destroying Southeast
Asia and, with the continued
vigilance of our local Protectors,
we will ultimately destroy
ourselves.

intervention ok
Editor, THE DAILY:
To achieve peace on the
Stanford campus it is only
necessary for courageous
leadership to insist upon and
enforce tolerance of disliked
opinions â€” even opinions about
the Cambodian and Laos
initiatives. Among scholars there
is no place for demonstrations or
protests, still less for the
incitement of sabotage, violence
and intimidation. Discussion,
argument and dialogue are the
sole legitimate avenues of dissent
within a university. What is now
needed is for the President to
make it clear that he himself
regards with respect the motives
and intellectual integrity (I do not
say "accepts the convictions") of
those scholars who believe (like
the advisers of President
Kennedy's, Johnson and Nixon)
that collective security demanded
the Viet Nam initiative and that
intervention in Cambodia and
Laos was necessary to hasten the
achievement of peace.
