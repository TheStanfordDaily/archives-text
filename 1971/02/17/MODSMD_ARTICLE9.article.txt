# Minority Bill Passed
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The ASSU Senate passed two pieces
of legislation last night and then
adjourned, in one of the shortest
meetings on record.
Adjournment for lack of a quorum
followed immediately after the passage
of a resolution calling for widened
representation on the Committee on
Minority Affairs.
Student representation on that
committee presently includes four
blacks, one chicano and one
Asian-American, but no American
Indians and no foreign students. Nelson
Nagai, who co-sponsored the
resolution, pointed out, "There just
isn't a wide enough diversity of
viewpoints on the Committee."
The resolution read in part, "Be it
resolved, that the Senate of the
Associated Students of Stanford
University request the Committee on
Nominations to reopen nominations for
the Committee on Minority Affiars,
with the specific purpose of increasing
Chicano, Native American and foreign
student representation."
The Senate further recommended to

"the Academic Senate Committee on
Committees and the President to
increase Chicano, Native American and
Asian-American faculty and staff
representation on the Committee on
Minority Affairs."
The Committee on Minority Affairs
is charged with submitting a report to
the President of the University during
Spring Quarter.
Isabel Aiegria and James Jefferson
also co-sponsored the resolution.
In the only other piece of business
considered, the Senate approved a$ 15 0
ASSU loan to Twain House to help
finance the purchase of a new stereo
system. The four year co-ed dormitory
suffered the loss of its stereo to
burglars earlier this year.
An amendment to the loan bill
instructed ASSU Financial Manager
Chuck Peterson to attach the house
funds of dormitories which are not
paying back old ASSU loans.
The entire meeting lasted less than a
half-hour. Only two more than the
quorum of twenty senators were
present at the beginning of the meeting,
and not even this number could be
maintained past 8 :00.
