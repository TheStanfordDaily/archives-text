Today In The Daily
One year ago today, the American /udicial system reached an
apex of sorts when a federal grand jury in Chicago found five :j:j
% defendants guilty of crossing state lines with intent to incite £
| riots at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Conspiracy g
$ charges against all members of the "Chicago 7" were denied. g
Judge Julius Hoffman, that lovable patriarch of penal g
jij: persuasion, imposed contempt charges ranging up to nearly two j:i
$ and one half years on the seven, and hit defense counsel William
:j:j M. Kunstler with sentences totaling four years and 13 days in :j:
:•:! jail for "fanning the flames of disruption." :j:
The system has never recovered from the shock of that £
21-week trial.
