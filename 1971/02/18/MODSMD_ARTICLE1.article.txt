# Black Soldiers’ Real Enemy: The American System?
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Earl Hose enlisted in the Marines back in 1961 to escape the black ghetto in
Oakland. He was part of the first American battalion to go to Indochina and
during the next ten years returned ..to Vietnam two more times. But like many
other black Gl's in Vietnam today, Earl Rose can no longer tolerate the hypocrisy
of fighting a war for a country that has not yet agreed to stop warring on its black
citizens.
"You see yourself fighting for your country and having your black brothers
and sisters being snuffed back home," Rose said. "Then the Army and the
whole society de-humanizes the Vietnamese into racist groups like gooks or
commies and describes them as dirty and slimy. Then you realize that those
attribues are the same slanderous remarks you get yourself in the states."
Another black GI, James Anthony who just returned from a tour of duty in
Germany added, "The black man's got no business in the army. They keep killing
our people back home and we're still being shipped out to Nam."
Eor the black Gl's shipped out to Vietnam, the war becomes an unbearable
mixture of institutional racism and pointless aggression against what many black
Gl's feel is an oppressed American people. "You see yourself killing other Third
World people," the veteran Rose said, "and you realize that the only reason you
are in Vietnam is because of mis-education about who the real enemy is."
The "real enemy" Rose and many other black Gl's feel, is the American
military which is waging the war. From the standpoint of a black soldier, that
argument is difficult to deny. The President report on the Selective Service reveals
that while only 18 percent of all qualified whites are drafted, 30 percent of
qualified blacks are shipped off to fight the war.
Heavy Fighting Duty
Even more sobering are the statistics concerning the combat roles of blacks in
Vietnam, where the 11 percent of the ground force that is black is assigned to 23
percent of the combat duties. Yet blacks account for one forth of all American
casualties.
Many blacks openly refuse to fight in the field against the Viet Gong. Officers

and NCO's who insist on ordering black troops into the field are commonly
"fragged"— or hit by a grenade rolled under their tent flaps.
Fragging has become so widespread that according to one Army account, 23
soldiers are in the Long Binh stockade for killing their CO's and 17 others are
currently on trial.
Rose, who now works as a postal employee in Daly City described one fragging
on his base in 1969. "Some guy just blew a sergeant away because he was making
us march around and do exercises like a training camp in the states. People kind of
dug it. They didn't cry too much."
Red Scarves Save Lives
Some black Gl's have worked out an unofficial agreement with the Viet Cong
to show they are neutral in the war. The January 13 th issue of the Free U
newspaper cited one veteran's experience. "I heard of some people in the South
who wore red scarves when they wanted to be neutral in the field. They said the
VC didn't shoot them when they all wore red scarves."
"I got one and put it on," the GI said, "and I ended up not carrying any
ammunition into the field the whole last three months I was in the country."

Another such incident occured, veteran Rose remembered, "When a patrol
went through some valley and back out without encountering any Vietnamese. On
the way out somebody found a note on the trail that said, "We know you arjj as
oppressed as we are by the American Army. We could have blown you up but you
are our brothers."
Avoiding Battle
When no such agreement between the North Vietnamese and the Gl's is
evident, other devices are used to bypass any field action. One black Gl's account
in the New York Times last month read, "We were supposed to go out a mile and
engage the Charlies right? Well what we did was go a hundred yards, find some
heavy foliage, smoke, rap, and sack out."
In a war that is unpopular with both black and white Americans, the tactic
of hiding out in the bush might be more popular than any more killing. For the
black GI in Vietnam, the refusal to fight the war is a more serious decision than
simply a desire to save one's life. "Black Gl's are being used by the military," Earl
Rose explained. "The overt racism makes you hate white people and the war. You
see that the real enemy for the black man is the American system."
