# Keilch Hearing Slated To Start Late Today
## 
### PHIL LIND 
The grievance committee for John
Keilch, a library employee dismissed
for his alleged participation in the
Lodge protest, has scheduled the first
of two hearings for Thursday at 4 :15 in
Room6l-H on the inner quad.
There has been some problem
beginning the hearing because of the
delay in deciding upon Keilch's
objection to the composition of the
committee.
On February 9 Keilch sent a letter
to President Lyman stating the
objection and his proposal for
rectifying the situation.
"I object to the composition of the
review committee. I requested the
formation of this committee on the
basis of fair representation. This has
been ignored. Not only has Mr. Weber
(Keilch's supervisor and the one who
dismissed him) been allowed to
designate a representative, but he has

gone completely beyond the library to
find another administrator.
"This must be rectified. There are
two alternative ways to rectify this: 1)
replace Mr. Weber's representative with
someone selected by the library Staff
Association, or 2) expand the
committee to five members, the
additional two to be chosen by the
library Staff Association," stated
Keilch.
The reply from Lyman came
yesterday."I have given serious
consideration to the questions that
were put to me in your memorandum
of February 9, 1971. The replacement
or addition of committee members
would serve to remove the matter from
the established grievance procedure at
the Third Stage, which I do not believe
to be appropriate or justified. I urge the
committee to continue with the
grievance review."
