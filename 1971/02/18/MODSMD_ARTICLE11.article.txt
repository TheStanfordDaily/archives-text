The Committee for Supplies to
Indochina yesterday released an open

letter to Pres. Lyman, asking his
support for its drive to collect money
to ship medical supplies to Laos and
North Vietnam.
Donations to the fund are not only
legal, they are even tax-deductible. The
American Friends Service Committee
has agreed to assist in the shipping.
The student committee asked
Lyman to:
"Indicate your support of our
project and urge, as a private citizen,
members of the Stanford community
to support it;
"Make a sizeable donation
immediately to indicate your firm
support. Many students are

University income. Will you do as
much?
"Accept the position of honorary
co-chairman of this committee to
express your deep concern over the
emergency condition brought about by
the Laos invasion.
"Aid us in contacting off-campus
individuals and institutions in an
attempt to secure funds."
