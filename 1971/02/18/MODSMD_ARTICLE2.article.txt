# Court Test
## Injunction Ruling Today 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
A hearing will be held at 9 :30 today
in Palo Alto to determine if a
preliminary injunction will supersede
the present temporary restraining order
enjoining 17 individuals and up to 1000
John Does from committing disruptive
acts at Stanford.
These defendents named in the
restraining order who have been
personally served with orders to show
cause must appear before the California
Superior Court in Department 2, North
County Building, 270 Grant Street in
Palo Alto.
According to James Siena, Legal
Adviser to President Lyman, about half
of the defendants named have been
served. Among those served is
Associate English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
The defendants have been ordered
to show cause why they, the
Venceremos organization, and any
persons acting in concert with them
should not be enjoined from actions
named in the temporary restraining
order. Actions specified include
trashing, disrupting classes, obstructing
entrances to University buildings, and
remaining in buildings closed to
demonstrators by University officials.
The preliminary injunction, if
adopted, would also prohibit certain of
the defendants from entering or being
on the Stanford campus. This provision
would apply only to the non-students
individually named in the restraining
order.
The provision concerning entrance
to the campus would not apply to
non-students going to and from their
parents' homes on campus, and would
allow any of the defendants to come on
campus to attend or gather evidence for
disciplinary hearings in which they are
involved.
The defendants who would be
effectively barred from campus under
this provision of the preliminary
injunction are: Bruce Franklin, Jane
Franklin, Katharine Barclay, Michael
Fox, Chris Katzenbach, Aaron
Manganiello, and Jeffery Youdelman.
Franklin has stated he would not
disobey such an injunction because he
already has "other felony charges
outstanding."
Persons violating any provisions of
the injunction could be found in

contempt of court, fined up to $500 ,
and be imprisoned for up to 5 days.
Persons entering into concert with a
defendant to violate any provision of
the injunction could be found guilty of
conspiracy to commit a misdemeanor
and be imprisoned for up to six
months.
Under the "John Doe" feature of
the injunction, the University could
name any person as a defendant. If it
could be proved that the person named

had constuctive notice of the
injunction's provisions and had
committed enjoined acts, the court
could rule him in contempt.
A rally will be held at noon in White
Plaza to discuss the injunction.
The University would be provided
with an effective immediate sanction
against both students and non students
if the injunction were ordered. The
injunction is similar to a less extensive
order issued in May of last year.
