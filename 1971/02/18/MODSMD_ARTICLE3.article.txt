# Black Students Union To Issue New Demands
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Black Students Union Chairman
Willie L. Newberry called Tuesday
night's "Book-in" at the undergraduate
library a response to the University's
inaction towards the BSU demands,
and stated that additional demands
would be made today. Newberry stated
that further BSU responses would be
forthcoming, but he declined to
elaborate.
The BSU issued its initial demands
in an open letter to President Richard
W. Lyman on February 9. The
University has made no official
response.
Last night in an unrelated incident,
about 400 people were evacuated from
Memorial Auditorium as police and
firemen responded to a bomb threat
minutes before a BSU sponsored Black
Panther political rock concert was
scheduled to begin.
After fifteen minutes, the crowd,
which gathered in front ot the
auditorium and chanted "Free Bobby!
and sang songs, returned to the building
despite official warnings that it was
doing so at its own risk.
Bomb Threat
Stanford Police Chief, Thomas Bell
said that the threat was phoned in to a
University operator at 8:12 p.m. "The
operator was told that two bombs
would go off in Memorial Auditorium,"
he said. "The caller did not indicate a
time."
Assistant Fire Chief, Joe Barr, who
led a search crew into the auditorium

said that the investigation was only 30%
completed when the audience returned
to their seats. "We were looking for
anything that was the least bit
suspicious," said Barr.
"Nationwide statistics show that
43% of the time (when threats are
called in) there has been something,"
Barr continued. "Either an explosive
device has been found or it has actually
gone off."
"Wouldn't Be Intimidated
Newberry said that the audience
resisted the threat "because they
wouldn't be intimidated." He issued a
statement concerning the incident
shortly after the concert began.
"When black people give the
slightest sign that they are going to
stand up and engage in political struggle
to change the racist conditions of their
environment, the system reacts. Such
was the nature of the bomb threat on
the lives of those at the appearance of the
'Lumpen' at Memorial Auditorium last
night. We will not be initimidated. Our
struggle on the Stanford campus has
been legal and non-destructive. But we
are watching the way Stanford treats
'proper' methods.
"But this should not be taken for
weakness or lack of determination for
we wish to make it very clear that we
will be heard."
The concert, which featured the
'Lumpen', consisted of rock music and
revolutionary lyrics. Most of the
audience was either affiliated with the
BSU or Venceremos.

night's "Book-in" at the undergraduate
library a response to the University's
inaction towards the BSU demands,
and stated that additional demands
would be made today. Newberry stated
that further BSU responses would be
forthcoming, but he declined to
elaborate.
The BSU issued its initial demands
in an open letter to President Richard
W. Lyman on February 9. The
University has made no official
response.
Last night in an unrelated incident,
about 400 people were evacuated from
Memorial Auditorium as police and
firemen responded to a bomb threat
minutes before a BSU sponsored Black
Panther political rock concert was
scheduled to begin.
After fifteen minutes, the crowd,
which gathered in front ot the
auditorium and chanted "Free Bobby!
and sang songs, returned to the building
despite official warnings that it was
doing so at its own risk.
Bomb Threat
Stanford Police Chief, Thomas Bell
said that the threat was phoned in to a
University operator at 8:12 p.m. "The
operator was told that two bombs
would go off in Memorial Auditorium,"
he said. "The caller did not indicate a
time."
Assistant Fire Chief, Joe Barr, who
led a search crew into the auditorium

said that the investigation was only 30%
completed when the audience returned
to their seats. "We were looking for
anything that was the least bit
suspicious," said Barr.
"Nationwide statistics show that
43% of the time (when threats are
called in) there has been something,"
Barr continued. "Either an explosive
device has been found or it has actually
gone off."
"Wouldn't Be Intimidated
Newberry said that the audience
resisted the threat "because they
wouldn't be intimidated." He issued a
statement concerning the incident
shortly after the concert began.
"When black people give the
slightest sign that they are going to
stand up and engage in political struggle
to change the racist conditions of their
environment, the system reacts. Such
was the nature of the bomb threat on
the lives of those at the appearance of the
'Lumpen' at Memorial Auditorium last
night. We will not be initimidated. Our
struggle on the Stanford campus has
been legal and non-destructive. But we
are watching the way Stanford treats
'proper' methods.
"But this should not be taken for
weakness or lack of determination for
we wish to make it very clear that we
will be heard."
The concert, which featured the
'Lumpen', consisted of rock music and
revolutionary lyrics. Most of the
audience was either affiliated with the
BSU or Venceremos.
