# Lederberg Calls For Co-operation In Combatting Biological Warfare
## 
### TOM PAULU 
A need for increased co-operation
"between countries not used to
cooperating with each other" was cited
as the most important step towards
combatting the spread of biological
warfare by Professor Joshua Lederberg
in a speech given Wednesday night in
Bishop Auditorium.
The Nobel Prize winner stated that
the development of military uses of
these weapons must be stopped before
they "override the politics and social
construction of the world," but that
the problem has never been taken
seriously by policy makers. "Biological
warfare is the most frightening use of
modern technology," he warned.
Lederberg stressed the need for
world law. The major treaty concerning
chemical and biological warfare is the
1925 Geneva Protocol, which was
ratified by major powers of the world,
not including the U.S.
However, he described how the

Protocol, by which subscribing nations
agree not to be the first to use germ or
chemical weapons, thus actually
encourages the development of the
weapons.
In the face of Congress's refusal to
ratify the Protocol, President Nixon in
November 1969 declared a unilateral
renunciation of the use of biological
weapons by the U.S. Lederberg assured
the audience that Nixon seems to be
sticking to his promise; that weapons
stockpiles are being disposed of.
Other countries are not following
suit, however, and he cited Nixon's
move as a loss of bargaining power in
negotations toward disarmament.
Lederberg explained that the
problem of biological, and more so, of
chemical weapons is extremely
complex. Some of the chemicals
deadliest to humans are also widely
used in industry—chlorine, for instance.
To end all research on these weapons

also means to end research against
disease.
"It's a two-way sword. Knowledge
of a deadly virus can be for the good or
for bad," he said. He suggested that
countries should work together as
much as possible on disease knowledge
in general, because the resulting
familiarity with one another's facilities
and scientists would greatly increase
the difficulty of conducting secret
research.
Professor Lederberg stressed that all
countries, not just major powers would
have to co-operate to extinguish the
danger from these weapons, because a
minor power, lacking conventional
weapons, would have the most to gain
by possessing all-powerful biological
weapons.
Lederberg appropriately summed up
his speech by saying that someone with
a destructive psychosis and Lederberg's
technical insight is what the world
should fear.

these weapons must be stopped before
they "override the politics and social
construction of the world," but that
the problem has never been taken
seriously by policy makers. "Biological
warfare is the most frightening use of
modern technology," he warned.
Lederberg stressed the need for
world law. The major treaty concerning
chemical and biological warfare is the
1925 Geneva Protocol, which was
ratified by major powers of the world,
not including the U.S.
However, he described how the

Protocol, by which subscribing nations
agree not to be the first to use germ or
chemical weapons, thus actually
encourages the development of the
weapons.
In the face of Congress's refusal to
ratify the Protocol, President Nixon in
November 1969 declared a unilateral
renunciation of the use of biological
weapons by the U.S. Lederberg assured
the audience that Nixon seems to be
sticking to his promise; that weapons
stockpiles are being disposed of.
Other countries are not following
suit, however, and he cited Nixon's
move as a loss of bargaining power in
negotations toward disarmament.
Lederberg explained that the
problem of biological, and more so, of
chemical weapons is extremely
complex. Some of the chemicals
deadliest to humans are also widely
used in industry—chlorine, for instance.
To end all research on these weapons

also means to end research against
disease.
"It's a two-way sword. Knowledge
of a deadly virus can be for the good or
for bad," he said. He suggested that
countries should work together as
much as possible on disease knowledge
in general, because the resulting
familiarity with one another's facilities
and scientists would greatly increase
the difficulty of conducting secret
research.
Professor Lederberg stressed that all
countries, not just major powers would
have to co-operate to extinguish the
danger from these weapons, because a
minor power, lacking conventional
weapons, would have the most to gain
by possessing all-powerful biological
weapons.
Lederberg appropriately summed up
his speech by saying that someone with
a destructive psychosis and Lederberg's
technical insight is what the world
should fear.

A need for increased co-operation
"between countries not used to
cooperating with each other" was cited
as the most important step towards
combatting the spread of biological
warfare by Professor Joshua Lederberg
in a speech given Wednesday night in
Bishop Auditorium.
The Nobel Prize winner stated that
the development of military uses of
these weapons must be stopped before
they "override the politics and social
construction of the world," but that
the problem has never been taken
seriously by policy makers. "Biological
warfare is the most frightening use of
modern technology," he warned.
