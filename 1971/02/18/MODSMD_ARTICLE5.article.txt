# Universities Faced With Acute Financial Problems
## 
### DAVE GLOSSBRENNER Second in a two part series 
In trying to balance their books, all
universities try to maintain the same
level of educational quality. Before
they cut their programs, institutions
will reduce maintenance. At University
of California campuses, maintenance
costs were cut from $37 million last
year to $2.8 million this year.
Some administrators see the money
crisis as a good thing because it has
forced most schools to evaluate
everything they do, thus producing
greater efficiency. Getting as much use

as they can from their facilities, Hiram
College in Ohio serves as the summer
training camp for the Cleveland Browns
football team. The California Board of
Regents has discussed 24 hour use of
facilities in the form of more night
classes. Even Princeton's controversial
co-ed program has proved to be a
bargain in more efficient use of
facilities. Some schools have decided to
operate at full capacity all year round.
The Carnegie Commission suggested
a revamping of the whole system. They
recommended reducing the degree
requirements and making the B.A. a

three year course, and also
recommended giving a fewer number of
degrees covering broader fields. They
further suggested a guaranteed two
years of college to everyone at any age.
College Mergers
To make better use of facilities,
more then a score of institutions have
merged. A good example is
Case-Western Reserve in Cleveland.
While merger has helped Case, they still
have problems. Last year its president
presented a budget with a deficit of $5
million and immediately resigned.
Some schools in Missouri have
suggested a plan that would help both
public and private universities. Through
their plan, the state would send their
excess students to private schools
where vacancies have recently arisen. In
St. Louis the state university had to
turn down about 500 students, while
due to higher costs, the University of
St. Ijouis had almost that many
vacancies.
Ail cuts and budget manipulations
will not help, however, if income does
not increase somehow. With constant
deficits, like those of the last six years
at Cornell, the quality of American
higher education will certainly
decrease. Li an attempt to solve the
problem, schools have launched
intensified campaigns for alumni
support but until the economy eases,
the battle will be extremely tough.
Tuition has been another area in
which administrators have looked for
relief. While tuition raises occurred on

the average once every four years in the
'5 o's, they came every other year in the
'60's and are expected to be yearly in
the '70's. The University of Minnesota
is looking for a 20 per cent raise in
tuition while the University of
Pennsylvania has raised their tuition by
$200 each of the last three years.
Student Fees
It is evident, though, that the
students will not be able to afford
many more raises in fees. Berkeley
students gave blood in a "Bleed for
Free Education" demonstration when
costs were raised. Continued fee hikes
will drive all but the very rich students
either into the already overcrowded
public program or out of higher
education entirely. As an example, at
USC the sophomore class is larger than
the freshman class. With decreased
student aid and increased tuition black
and other minority students will have
trouble attending school.
Some have suggested that those
students who can afford to pay the full
cost of their education be required to
do so. Currently student fees cover less
than half of the total cost of education.
This plan, however, would be sure to
meet heavy opposition and would also
be difficult to administrate.
The only way out of the current
crisis in the eyes of most college
administrators is massive federal and
stale aid. New York was called upon to
bail out Fordham University with
nearly I wo million dollars last year. The
main source of monev, though, will

have to come from the federal
government. In 1 9 66 , federal aid to
higher education totaled $2.7 billion
and the estimated figure for 1971 is
$5.3 billion.
Government Cuts
While this is a substantial increase, it
is still not enough. The figures do not
tell of the decreased student aid and
slashed aid to medical schools. Most
administrators feel that if the
government can loan the nation's
largest railroad $125 million to stave
off bankruptcy or spend $1.4 billion to
keep the C 5 A transport plane solvent,
it can certainly come to the aid of the
nation's floundering institutions.
These institutions are many, and the
money squeeze knows no prestige due
to age or large endowments. All eight
schools in the Ivy League had money
problems last year. Harvard, recovering
from a deficit budget, was the only one
to make ends meet. Brown had a deficit
of $3 million or 8 per cent of its
budget. Princeton went down to the
tune of $2.4 million. Yale has had three
years of deficit spending, and this year
will be its fourth.
Of the 128 black Southern colleges
50 private ones are near collapse. Most
other Southern schools have faired
better and the larger black schools are
better off then the small ones.
When the Carnegie Commission
made its report on the financial status
of the nation's colleges and universities,
it found that of the schools studied, the
California state schools were the only

public system to be in trouble. They
listed Berkeley and San Diego State as
being in critical condition.
Schools in Trouble
Othe % schools showing considerable
deficits (from SI million to $1.4
million) include Southern Methodist
University, the University of Chicago,
the University of Michigan, the
University of Detroit, and Wellesly.
Perhaps one of the most depressingareas
of financial concern in higher education
is the medical schools. At New York
Medical School, the deficit was so great
that it required half a million dollars
from a federal loan, selling $6 million
of endowment, and mortgaging $10
million of property to make ends meet.
The medical school of St. Louis
University was unable to admit a first
year class for 1971. John Hopkins
suffered a two million dollar deficit.
George Washington University med
school is asking Congress for five
thousand dollars per student per year in
addition to raising their tuition from
two thousand dollars last year to three
thousand dollars next year.
Georgetown University and George
Washington University had a combined
deficit of $3.4 million and their only
hope is now Congressional support.
It is evident from (he casualty list
that something must be done soon if
American private education is to
maintain its present quality and not
become "a thing of the past."
In trying to balance their books, all

year class for 1971. John Hopkins
suffered a two million dollar deficit.
George Washington University med
school is asking Congress for five
thousand dollars per student per year in
addition to raising their tuition from
two thousand dollars last year to three
thousand dollars next year.
Georgetown University and George
Washington University had a combined
deficit of $3.4 million and their only
hope is now Congressional support.
It is evident from (he casualty list
that something must be done soon if
American private education is to
maintain its present quality and not
become "a thing of the past."
In trying to balance their books, all
universities try to maintain the same
level of educational quality. Before
they cut their programs, institutions
will reduce maintenance. At University
of California campuses, maintenance
costs were cut from $37 million last
year to $2.8 million this year.
Some administrators see the money
crisis as a good thing because it has
forced most schools to evaluate
everything they do, thus producing
greater efficiency. Getting as much use

as they can from their facilities, Hiram
College in Ohio serves as the summer
training camp for the Cleveland Browns
football team. The California Board of
Regents has discussed 24 hour use of
facilities in the form of more night
classes. Even Princeton's controversial
co-ed program has proved to be a
bargain in more efficient use of
facilities. Some schools have decided to
operate at full capacity all year round.
The Carnegie Commission suggested
a revamping of the whole system. They
recommended reducing the degree
requirements and making the B.A. a

three year course, and also
recommended giving a fewer number of
degrees covering broader fields. They
further suggested a guaranteed two
years of college to everyone at any age.
College Mergers
To make better use of facilities,
more then a score of institutions have
merged. A good example is
Case-Western Reserve in Cleveland.
While merger has helped Case, they still
have problems. Last year its president
presented a budget with a deficit of $5
million and immediately resigned.
Some schools in Missouri have
suggested a plan that would help both
public and private universities. Through
their plan, the state would send their
excess students to private schools
where vacancies have recently arisen. In
St. Louis the state university had to
turn down about 500 students, while
due to higher costs, the University of
St. Ijouis had almost that many
vacancies.
Ail cuts and budget manipulations
will not help, however, if income does
not increase somehow. With constant
deficits, like those of the last six years
at Cornell, the quality of American
higher education will certainly
decrease. Li an attempt to solve the
problem, schools have launched
intensified campaigns for alumni
support but until the economy eases,
the battle will be extremely tough.
Tuition has been another area in
which administrators have looked for
relief. While tuition raises occurred on

the average once every four years in the
'5 o's, they came every other year in the
'60's and are expected to be yearly in
the '70's. The University of Minnesota
is looking for a 20 per cent raise in
tuition while the University of
Pennsylvania has raised their tuition by
$200 each of the last three years.
Student Fees
It is evident, though, that the
students will not be able to afford
many more raises in fees. Berkeley
students gave blood in a "Bleed for
Free Education" demonstration when
costs were raised. Continued fee hikes
will drive all but the very rich students
either into the already overcrowded
public program or out of higher
education entirely. As an example, at
USC the sophomore class is larger than
the freshman class. With decreased
student aid and increased tuition black
and other minority students will have
trouble attending school.
Some have suggested that those
students who can afford to pay the full
cost of their education be required to
do so. Currently student fees cover less
than half of the total cost of education.
This plan, however, would be sure to
meet heavy opposition and would also
be difficult to administrate.
The only way out of the current
crisis in the eyes of most college
administrators is massive federal and
stale aid. New York was called upon to
bail out Fordham University with
nearly I wo million dollars last year. The
main source of monev, though, will

have to come from the federal
government. In 1 9 66 , federal aid to
higher education totaled $2.7 billion
and the estimated figure for 1971 is
$5.3 billion.
Government Cuts
While this is a substantial increase, it
is still not enough. The figures do not
tell of the decreased student aid and
slashed aid to medical schools. Most
administrators feel that if the
government can loan the nation's
largest railroad $125 million to stave
off bankruptcy or spend $1.4 billion to
keep the C 5 A transport plane solvent,
it can certainly come to the aid of the
nation's floundering institutions.
These institutions are many, and the
money squeeze knows no prestige due
to age or large endowments. All eight
schools in the Ivy League had money
problems last year. Harvard, recovering
from a deficit budget, was the only one
to make ends meet. Brown had a deficit
of $3 million or 8 per cent of its
budget. Princeton went down to the
tune of $2.4 million. Yale has had three
years of deficit spending, and this year
will be its fourth.
Of the 128 black Southern colleges
50 private ones are near collapse. Most
other Southern schools have faired
better and the larger black schools are
better off then the small ones.
When the Carnegie Commission
made its report on the financial status
of the nation's colleges and universities,
it found that of the schools studied, the
California state schools were the only

public system to be in trouble. They
listed Berkeley and San Diego State as
being in critical condition.
Schools in Trouble
Othe % schools showing considerable
deficits (from SI million to $1.4
million) include Southern Methodist
University, the University of Chicago,
the University of Michigan, the
University of Detroit, and Wellesly.
Perhaps one of the most depressingareas
of financial concern in higher education
is the medical schools. At New York
Medical School, the deficit was so great
that it required half a million dollars
from a federal loan, selling $6 million
of endowment, and mortgaging $10
million of property to make ends meet.
The medical school of St. Louis
University was unable to admit a first
year class for 1971. John Hopkins
suffered a two million dollar deficit.
George Washington University med
school is asking Congress for five
thousand dollars per student per year in
addition to raising their tuition from

deficits (from SI million to $1.4
million) include Southern Methodist
University, the University of Chicago,
the University of Michigan, the
University of Detroit, and Wellesly.
Perhaps one of the most depressingareas
of financial concern in higher education
is the medical schools. At New York
Medical School, the deficit was so great
that it required half a million dollars
from a federal loan, selling $6 million
of endowment, and mortgaging $10
million of property to make ends meet.
The medical school of St. Louis
University was unable to admit a first
year class for 1971. John Hopkins
suffered a two million dollar deficit.
George Washington University med
school is asking Congress for five
thousand dollars per student per year in
addition to raising their tuition from
two thousand dollars last year to three
thousand dollars next year.
Georgetown University and George
Washington University had a combined
deficit of $3.4 million and their only
hope is now Congressional support.
It is evident from (he casualty list
that something must be done soon if
American private education is to
maintain its present quality and not
become "a thing of the past."
In trying to balance their books, all
universities try to maintain the same
level of educational quality. Before
they cut their programs, institutions
will reduce maintenance. At University
of California campuses, maintenance
costs were cut from $37 million last
year to $2.8 million this year.
Some administrators see the money
crisis as a good thing because it has
forced most schools to evaluate
everything they do, thus producing
greater efficiency. Getting as much use

as they can from their facilities, Hiram
College in Ohio serves as the summer
training camp for the Cleveland Browns
football team. The California Board of
Regents has discussed 24 hour use of
facilities in the form of more night
classes. Even Princeton's controversial
co-ed program has proved to be a
bargain in more efficient use of
facilities. Some schools have decided to
operate at full capacity all year round.
The Carnegie Commission suggested
a revamping of the whole system. They
recommended reducing the degree
requirements and making the B.A. a

three year course, and also
recommended giving a fewer number of
degrees covering broader fields. They
further suggested a guaranteed two
years of college to everyone at any age.
College Mergers
To make better use of facilities,
more then a score of institutions have
merged. A good example is
Case-Western Reserve in Cleveland.
While merger has helped Case, they still
have problems. Last year its president
presented a budget with a deficit of $5
million and immediately resigned.
Some schools in Missouri have
suggested a plan that would help both
public and private universities. Through
their plan, the state would send their
excess students to private schools
where vacancies have recently arisen. In
St. Louis the state university had to
turn down about 500 students, while
due to higher costs, the University of
St. Ijouis had almost that many
vacancies.
Ail cuts and budget manipulations
will not help, however, if income does
not increase somehow. With constant
deficits, like those of the last six years
at Cornell, the quality of American
higher education will certainly
decrease. Li an attempt to solve the
problem, schools have launched
intensified campaigns for alumni
support but until the economy eases,
the battle will be extremely tough.
Tuition has been another area in
which administrators have looked for
relief. While tuition raises occurred on

the average once every four years in the
'5 o's, they came every other year in the
'60's and are expected to be yearly in
the '70's. The University of Minnesota
is looking for a 20 per cent raise in
tuition while the University of
Pennsylvania has raised their tuition by
$200 each of the last three years.
Student Fees
It is evident, though, that the
students will not be able to afford
many more raises in fees. Berkeley
students gave blood in a "Bleed for
Free Education" demonstration when
costs were raised. Continued fee hikes
will drive all but the very rich students
either into the already overcrowded
public program or out of higher
education entirely. As an example, at
USC the sophomore class is larger than
the freshman class. With decreased
student aid and increased tuition black
and other minority students will have
trouble attending school.
Some have suggested that those
students who can afford to pay the full
cost of their education be required to
do so. Currently student fees cover less
than half of the total cost of education.
This plan, however, would be sure to
meet heavy opposition and would also
be difficult to administrate.
The only way out of the current
crisis in the eyes of most college
administrators is massive federal and
stale aid. New York was called upon to
bail out Fordham University with
nearly I wo million dollars last year. The
main source of monev, though, will

have to come from the federal
government. In 1 9 66 , federal aid to
higher education totaled $2.7 billion
and the estimated figure for 1971 is
$5.3 billion.
Government Cuts
While this is a substantial increase, it
is still not enough. The figures do not
tell of the decreased student aid and
slashed aid to medical schools. Most
administrators feel that if the
government can loan the nation's
largest railroad $125 million to stave
off bankruptcy or spend $1.4 billion to
keep the C 5 A transport plane solvent,
it can certainly come to the aid of the
nation's floundering institutions.
These institutions are many, and the
money squeeze knows no prestige due
to age or large endowments. All eight
schools in the Ivy League had money
problems last year. Harvard, recovering
from a deficit budget, was the only one
to make ends meet. Brown had a deficit
of $3 million or 8 per cent of its
budget. Princeton went down to the
tune of $2.4 million. Yale has had three
years of deficit spending, and this year
will be its fourth.
Of the 128 black Southern colleges
50 private ones are near collapse. Most
other Southern schools have faired
better and the larger black schools are
better off then the small ones.
When the Carnegie Commission
made its report on the financial status
of the nation's colleges and universities,
it found that of the schools studied, the
California state schools were the only

public system to be in trouble. They
listed Berkeley and San Diego State as
being in critical condition.
