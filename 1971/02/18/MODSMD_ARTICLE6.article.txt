# voting of university stock
## Round Two: Campaign GM bob grant 
### 
Round Two of Campaign GM is at hand.
Following up on last year's efforts, diverse groups
are forming to support three proposals to be voted
on at the May stockholders' meeting of General
Motors.
Last year a proposal was submitted to the Board
of Trustees requesting that Stanford vote its
approximately 25 ,000 shares in favor of the first set
of proposals. A referendum of the student body
supported the proposals by about five to one.
A subcommittee of the Board was established to
consider the appropriate University position.
Because of the turmoil of last April and May the
committee had no time to meet or to study the
problems raised. The result was a resolution in
which the University neither voted in favor nor
against the Campaign GM proposals, but remained
neutral. In addition, it was urged that a committee
be established to recommend a policy statement on
the voting of corporate stocks held by Stanford and
related issues of investment policy where social and
ethical issues may be involved.
This committee is chaired by Professor Lee Bach
and includes Trustees Fred Merrill, Ben Duniway,
Richard Guggenhime, William Hewlett, Dennis
Hayes and student Robert Mac Lean. Us report is
expected for the April board meeting. If anyone
would like to submit written arguments on any
aspect of the issue under consideration by the
committee, present them to Professor Bach before
February 25.

Campaign GM, Round Two, is offering three
proposals. The first provides for the nomination of
persons for the Board of Directors by shareholders
and requires that the names so nominated be placed
on the proxy statement.
The second provides for the election of three of
the Board members by specific constituent groups:
GM employees, GM dealers, and GM auto
purchasers.
The third provides for disclosure in the annual
report of corporate activity in the area of minority
hiring, air pollution, and auto safety policies.
Details on these proposals and supporting
arguments are available from R.N. Grant at the
ASSU.
The Senate will be asked to place each of these
proposals on the spring ballot for a referendum by
the student body. In addition, we have invited
representatives from Campaign GM and General
Motors to come to Stanford and debate the
proposals. Campaign GM has already accepted.
A means must be developed by which the
managers of great corporate wealth will make their
decisions in a context broader than the profit
motive and with an understanding and concern for
the environmental, economic, and social effects of
their acts.
The best means offered to date are the Campaign
GM proposals. Stanford and all owners of GM stock
should support Campaign GM.

the student body. In addition, we have invited
representatives from Campaign GM and General
Motors to come to Stanford and debate the
proposals. Campaign GM has already accepted.
A means must be developed by which the
managers of great corporate wealth will make their
decisions in a context broader than the profit
motive and with an understanding and concern for
the environmental, economic, and social effects of
their acts.
The best means offered to date are the Campaign
GM proposals. Stanford and all owners of GM stock
should support Campaign GM.

Round Two of Campaign GM is at hand.
Following up on last year's efforts, diverse groups
are forming to support three proposals to be voted
on at the May stockholders' meeting of General
Motors.
Last year a proposal was submitted to the Board
of Trustees requesting that Stanford vote its
approximately 25 ,000 shares in favor of the first set
of proposals. A referendum of the student body
supported the proposals by about five to one.
A subcommittee of the Board was established to
consider the appropriate University position.
Because of the turmoil of last April and May the
committee had no time to meet or to study the
problems raised. The result was a resolution in
which the University neither voted in favor nor
against the Campaign GM proposals, but remained
neutral. In addition, it was urged that a committee
be established to recommend a policy statement on
the voting of corporate stocks held by Stanford and
related issues of investment policy where social and
ethical issues may be involved.
This committee is chaired by Professor Lee Bach
and includes Trustees Fred Merrill, Ben Duniway,
Richard Guggenhime, William Hewlett, Dennis
Hayes and student Robert Mac Lean. Us report is
expected for the April board meeting. If anyone
would like to submit written arguments on any
aspect of the issue under consideration by the
committee, present them to Professor Bach before
February 25.

Campaign GM, Round Two, is offering three
proposals. The first provides for the nomination of
persons for the Board of Directors by shareholders
and requires that the names so nominated be placed
on the proxy statement.
The second provides for the election of three of
the Board members by specific constituent groups:
GM employees, GM dealers, and GM auto
purchasers.
The third provides for disclosure in the annual
report of corporate activity in the area of minority
hiring, air pollution, and auto safety policies.
Details on these proposals and supporting
arguments are available from R.N. Grant at the
ASSU.
The Senate will be asked to place each of these
proposals on the spring ballot for a referendum by
the student body. In addition, we have invited
representatives from Campaign GM and General
Motors to come to Stanford and debate the
proposals. Campaign GM has already accepted.
