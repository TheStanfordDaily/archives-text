# don't be intimidated from effective protest
## We Are All John Does 
### 
Recent events on the Stanford
campus once again illuminate the
inextricable connections between
continued prosecution of
genocidal war against the people
of Southeast Asia and trowing
fascism at home.
The people of the United
States have voiced their
opposition to the war, and have
demanded that it be ended. The
ruling class is confronted with an
unavoidable contradiction. To
continue the war is to pour fuel
on the steadily growing
revolutionary flame at home,
which is tearing away the mask of
corporate liberalism from the
ruling class and baring the true
exploitive nature of our society.
Yet to end the war at this
point (or at any point short of
reducing the indigenous
population of Vietnam to Thieu,
Ky and their American
bodyguards) is to sacrifice the
economic advantages of
ownership of the Third World,
which the ruling class so
desperately needs to maintain its
grip at home.

In seeking to avoid the
necessary results of this
contradiction, the federal
administration has chosen a
two-pronged strategy. First, it has
attempted to throw a
smokescreen over what is
happening in Indochina. The
illusion, that the war is being
ended, is maintained by
withdrawal of U.S. ground troops,
while destruction and death is
escalated by massive increases in
the application of technological
warfare.
Nixon Doctrine
The technological increase is
itself covered by the assertion that
we are "protecting American
boys" as they prepare to leave
Vietnam. The Nixon doctrine is in
full bloom here, for all to see. In
plain language, it is that no longer
may American lives be sacrificed
to serve our ruling class interests
in the Third World.
Rather, we will use Asians to
kill Asians, Arabs to kill Arabs,
Africans to kill Africans, but still
in support of the same interests.
In light of recent happenings in
Laos, it is clear that we will soon
be training the ARVN to fly our
helicopters.
The second prong of the
strategy, diffusion and/or
repression of anti-war activity at
home, is evidenced by a number
of things. The most obvious, but
perhaps easiest disregarded, is the
conjunction of the invasion of
Laos with Apollo 14 .
The invasion was begun before
the end of the monsoon, imposing
tremendous logistical difficulties
on the invading forces. It is hard
to imagine any reason for such an
egregious tactical error, other than
considerations of lessening the
impact at home by taking
advantage of a major attention
diverting event. This conclusion is
buttressed by the way news of the
invasion was managed to avoid
sudden full intrusion on our
consciousness.
News Management
The second diffusing tactic has
been management of news. The
mutually supportive effect
of reactions on campuses and in
communities across the country
last May was not missed by the
administration. True, the current
reaction has not approached the
level of last May. But from the
owners of the "free press" one
would get the idea that there has
been no reaction.
We know from other sources
that opposition has begun
mobilization across the country.
We also know that New York
receives no news about California,
except what is obtained through
friends of the Liberation News
Service. Either newspapers have
suddenly rejected a long-standing
tradition of sensationalized
journalism, or the word is out to
keep it quiet.
Here we are experiencing the

more open tactic of direct
repression, an injunction against
certain named individuals, the
Venceremos organization, and one
thousand John Does. It is sought
to be justified as necessary to
maintain the University as "an
open forum." Taken in the
context of what has happened
here, it is clear that it was
obtained for other reasons, and
serves an exactly contrary
purpose.
Richard Lyman has stated that
if the war could be ended by
anguished letters from college
presidents, it would be over by
now. He understands, as do we,
that it cannot be ended in that
way. He has not examined the
paths open to a university
president which might help end
the war, because they pose a
threat to the university.
University Complicity
We know that University
support through research and
applied technology has been vital
to the U.S. war effort, particularly
as it has shifted to a highly
technological form. Action by the
president to end this complicity
would result in the loss of
government money, and
contributions from big war
profiteers. When presented with
the alternative of helping
effectively to end the war, or
preserving the institution, Richard
Lyman choses his job over the
lives of a few million Asians.
Having made this choice, the
rest is easy. Beginning with the
Lodge demonstration, some
members of the Stanford
community once again asserted
their refusal to be bound to
ineffective protest and exercises in
futility. These actions were at first
met with the relatively meager
repressive means of the
University, i.e. SJC proceedings.
February 10 a move was made
against the computation center.
Out of concern for their $5
million machine, the University
administrators were forced to
withdraw use of the facility from
an SRI program which planned
invasions of Indochina. Such
effective protests could not be
tolerated, and the University
moved to bring in the additional
repressive strength of the legal
system by obtaining the
injunction.
As shown elsewhere (The
Liberated Daily) a major value of
the injunction is fear. By
obscuring the relatively clear
distinctions between legal and
illegal acts it operates to make
people overly cautious about the
way they protest the war. It casts
a pall of uncertainty over actions
which normally are under the
clear protection of the First
Amendment. Ineffective protest
becomes the only safe protest.
No Jury Trial
But other effects, more
distinctively fascistic in nature,

Jim o'fallon

must also be exposed. First, the
injunction operates to deny the
right to a trial by jury for acts
where that right normally obtains.
In an essentially summary
proceeding before a judge, a
person may receive as much as 6
months in jail and a $500 fine for
contempt of court.
Secondly, by specifically
naming certain individuals and the
Venceremos organization, it
denies them the right to engage in
any type of protest on the
Stanford 'campus. As the John
Does are replaced by real names,
the same provisions come into
effect against those people.
A quick perusal of the names,
together with some knowledge of
recent events here, allows one to
see the purpose of this provision.
The university has identified these
people as leaders through their
participation in actions and their
strong work to expose the extent
of Stanford's complicity in the
war. By removing this leadership
they believe they will succeed in
destroying the movement.
A special word is relevant to
the Venceremos organization. The
university has attempted to set up
this organization as the primary
threat to the University, thereby
obscuring that the threat comes
from the rightful rage of the
people at the complictous acts of
the university.
Scapegoating
The logical conclusion of such
scapegoating under fascism is
shown by German extermination
of Jews, and the current program
against the Black Panther Party.
We should remember the effective
tactic of the Danes during World
War 11, when the mass of the
pec pie became Jews, wearing the
required insignia.
Our response to the injunction
should be clear. We must not
allow the university to impose the
role of impotent protestors on us.
We must confront Lyman with
the fact that we know we are all
John Does, and will not allow
ourselves to be intimidated from
the path of effective protest.
Further, we must show our
solidarity with our brothers and
sisters in the struggle who stand
most exposed to the latest wave
of fascism at Stanford.

Recent events on the Stanford
campus once again illuminate the
inextricable connections between
continued prosecution of
genocidal war against the people
of Southeast Asia and trowing
fascism at home.
The people of the United
States have voiced their
opposition to the war, and have
demanded that it be ended. The
ruling class is confronted with an
unavoidable contradiction. To
continue the war is to pour fuel
on the steadily growing
revolutionary flame at home,
which is tearing away the mask of
corporate liberalism from the
ruling class and baring the true
exploitive nature of our society.
Yet to end the war at this
point (or at any point short of
reducing the indigenous
population of Vietnam to Thieu,
Ky and their American
bodyguards) is to sacrifice the
economic advantages of
ownership of the Third World,
which the ruling class so
desperately needs to maintain its
grip at home.

In seeking to avoid the
necessary results of this
contradiction, the federal
administration has chosen a
two-pronged strategy. First, it has
attempted to throw a
smokescreen over what is
happening in Indochina. The
illusion, that the war is being
ended, is maintained by
withdrawal of U.S. ground troops,
while destruction and death is
escalated by massive increases in
the application of technological
warfare.
Nixon Doctrine
The technological increase is
itself covered by the assertion that
we are "protecting American
boys" as they prepare to leave
Vietnam. The Nixon doctrine is in
full bloom here, for all to see. In
plain language, it is that no longer
may American lives be sacrificed
to serve our ruling class interests
in the Third World.
Rather, we will use Asians to
kill Asians, Arabs to kill Arabs,
Africans to kill Africans, but still
in support of the same interests.
In light of recent happenings in
Laos, it is clear that we will soon
be training the ARVN to fly our
helicopters.
The second prong of the
strategy, diffusion and/or
repression of anti-war activity at
home, is evidenced by a number
of things. The most obvious, but
perhaps easiest disregarded, is the
conjunction of the invasion of
Laos with Apollo 14 .
The invasion was begun before
the end of the monsoon, imposing
tremendous logistical difficulties
on the invading forces. It is hard
to imagine any reason for such an
egregious tactical error, other than
considerations of lessening the
impact at home by taking
advantage of a major attention
diverting event. This conclusion is
buttressed by the way news of the
invasion was managed to avoid
sudden full intrusion on our
consciousness.
News Management
The second diffusing tactic has
been management of news. The
mutually supportive effect
of reactions on campuses and in
communities across the country
last May was not missed by the
administration. True, the current
reaction has not approached the
level of last May. But from the
owners of the "free press" one
would get the idea that there has
been no reaction.
We know from other sources
that opposition has begun
mobilization across the country.
We also know that New York
receives no news about California,
except what is obtained through
friends of the Liberation News
Service. Either newspapers have
suddenly rejected a long-standing
tradition of sensationalized
journalism, or the word is out to
keep it quiet.
Here we are experiencing the

more open tactic of direct
repression, an injunction against
certain named individuals, the
Venceremos organization, and one
thousand John Does. It is sought
to be justified as necessary to
maintain the University as "an
open forum." Taken in the
context of what has happened
here, it is clear that it was
obtained for other reasons, and
serves an exactly contrary
purpose.
Richard Lyman has stated that
if the war could be ended by
anguished letters from college
presidents, it would be over by
now. He understands, as do we,
that it cannot be ended in that
way. He has not examined the
paths open to a university
president which might help end
the war, because they pose a
threat to the university.
University Complicity
We know that University
support through research and
applied technology has been vital
to the U.S. war effort, particularly
as it has shifted to a highly
technological form. Action by the
president to end this complicity
would result in the loss of
government money, and
contributions from big war
profiteers. When presented with
the alternative of helping
effectively to end the war, or
preserving the institution, Richard
Lyman choses his job over the
lives of a few million Asians.
Having made this choice, the
rest is easy. Beginning with the
Lodge demonstration, some
members of the Stanford
community once again asserted
their refusal to be bound to
ineffective protest and exercises in
futility. These actions were at first
met with the relatively meager
repressive means of the
University, i.e. SJC proceedings.
February 10 a move was made
against the computation center.
Out of concern for their $5
million machine, the University
administrators were forced to
withdraw use of the facility from
an SRI program which planned
invasions of Indochina. Such
effective protests could not be
tolerated, and the University
moved to bring in the additional
repressive strength of the legal
system by obtaining the
injunction.
As shown elsewhere (The
Liberated Daily) a major value of
the injunction is fear. By
obscuring the relatively clear
distinctions between legal and
illegal acts it operates to make
people overly cautious about the
way they protest the war. It casts
a pall of uncertainty over actions
which normally are under the
clear protection of the First
Amendment. Ineffective protest
becomes the only safe protest.
No Jury Trial
But other effects, more
distinctively fascistic in nature,

Jim o'fallon

must also be exposed. First, the
injunction operates to deny the
right to a trial by jury for acts
where that right normally obtains.
In an essentially summary
proceeding before a judge, a
person may receive as much as 6
months in jail and a $500 fine for
contempt of court.
Secondly, by specifically
naming certain individuals and the
Venceremos organization, it
denies them the right to engage in
any type of protest on the
Stanford 'campus. As the John
Does are replaced by real names,
the same provisions come into
effect against those people.
A quick perusal of the names,
together with some knowledge of
recent events here, allows one to
see the purpose of this provision.
The university has identified these
people as leaders through their
participation in actions and their
strong work to expose the extent
of Stanford's complicity in the
war. By removing this leadership
they believe they will succeed in
destroying the movement.
A special word is relevant to
the Venceremos organization. The
university has attempted to set up
this organization as the primary
threat to the University, thereby
obscuring that the threat comes
from the rightful rage of the
people at the complictous acts of
the university.
Scapegoating
The logical conclusion of such
scapegoating under fascism is
shown by German extermination
of Jews, and the current program
against the Black Panther Party.
We should remember the effective
tactic of the Danes during World
War 11, when the mass of the
pec pie became Jews, wearing the
required insignia.
Our response to the injunction
should be clear. We must not
allow the university to impose the
role of impotent protestors on us.
We must confront Lyman with
the fact that we know we are all
John Does, and will not allow
ourselves to be intimidated from
the path of effective protest.
Further, we must show our
solidarity with our brothers and
sisters in the struggle who stand
most exposed to the latest wave
of fascism at Stanford.

Political Prisoners.

Recent events on the Stanford
campus once again illuminate the
inextricable connections between
continued prosecution of
genocidal war against the people
of Southeast Asia and trowing
fascism at home.
The people of the United
States have voiced their
opposition to the war, and have
demanded that it be ended. The
ruling class is confronted with an
unavoidable contradiction. To
continue the war is to pour fuel
on the steadily growing
revolutionary flame at home,
which is tearing away the mask of
corporate liberalism from the
ruling class and baring the true
exploitive nature of our society.
Yet to end the war at this
point (or at any point short of
reducing the indigenous
population of Vietnam to Thieu,
Ky and their American
bodyguards) is to sacrifice the
economic advantages of
ownership of the Third World,
which the ruling class so
desperately needs to maintain its
grip at home.

In seeking to avoid the
necessary results of this
contradiction, the federal
administration has chosen a
two-pronged strategy. First, it has
attempted to throw a
smokescreen over what is
happening in Indochina. The
illusion, that the war is being
ended, is maintained by
withdrawal of U.S. ground troops,
while destruction and death is
escalated by massive increases in
the application of technological
warfare.
Nixon Doctrine
The technological increase is
itself covered by the assertion that
we are "protecting American
boys" as they prepare to leave
Vietnam. The Nixon doctrine is in
full bloom here, for all to see. In
plain language, it is that no longer
may American lives be sacrificed
to serve our ruling class interests
in the Third World.
Rather, we will use Asians to
kill Asians, Arabs to kill Arabs,
Africans to kill Africans, but still
in support of the same interests.
In light of recent happenings in
Laos, it is clear that we will soon
be training the ARVN to fly our
helicopters.
The second prong of the
strategy, diffusion and/or
repression of anti-war activity at
home, is evidenced by a number
of things. The most obvious, but
perhaps easiest disregarded, is the
conjunction of the invasion of
Laos with Apollo 14 .
The invasion was begun before
the end of the monsoon, imposing
tremendous logistical difficulties
on the invading forces. It is hard
to imagine any reason for such an
egregious tactical error, other than
considerations of lessening the
impact at home by taking
advantage of a major attention
diverting event. This conclusion is
buttressed by the way news of the
invasion was managed to avoid
sudden full intrusion on our
consciousness.
News Management
The second diffusing tactic has
been management of news. The
mutually supportive effect
of reactions on campuses and in
communities across the country
last May was not missed by the
administration. True, the current
reaction has not approached the
level of last May. But from the
owners of the "free press" one
would get the idea that there has
been no reaction.
We know from other sources
that opposition has begun
mobilization across the country.
We also know that New York
receives no news about California,
except what is obtained through
friends of the Liberation News
Service. Either newspapers have
suddenly rejected a long-standing
tradition of sensationalized
journalism, or the word is out to
keep it quiet.
Here we are experiencing the

more open tactic of direct
repression, an injunction against
certain named individuals, the
Venceremos organization, and one
thousand John Does. It is sought
to be justified as necessary to
maintain the University as "an
open forum." Taken in the
context of what has happened
here, it is clear that it was
obtained for other reasons, and
serves an exactly contrary
purpose.
Richard Lyman has stated that
if the war could be ended by
anguished letters from college
presidents, it would be over by
now. He understands, as do we,
that it cannot be ended in that
way. He has not examined the
paths open to a university
president which might help end
the war, because they pose a
threat to the university.
University Complicity
We know that University
support through research and
applied technology has been vital
to the U.S. war effort, particularly
as it has shifted to a highly
technological form. Action by the
president to end this complicity
would result in the loss of
government money, and
contributions from big war
profiteers. When presented with
the alternative of helping
effectively to end the war, or
preserving the institution, Richard
Lyman choses his job over the
lives of a few million Asians.
Having made this choice, the
rest is easy. Beginning with the
Lodge demonstration, some
members of the Stanford
community once again asserted
their refusal to be bound to
ineffective protest and exercises in
futility. These actions were at first
met with the relatively meager
repressive means of the
University, i.e. SJC proceedings.
February 10 a move was made
against the computation center.
Out of concern for their $5
million machine, the University
administrators were forced to
withdraw use of the facility from
an SRI program which planned
invasions of Indochina. Such
effective protests could not be
tolerated, and the University
moved to bring in the additional
repressive strength of the legal
system by obtaining the
injunction.
As shown elsewhere (The
Liberated Daily) a major value of
the injunction is fear. By
obscuring the relatively clear
distinctions between legal and
illegal acts it operates to make
people overly cautious about the
way they protest the war. It casts
a pall of uncertainty over actions
which normally are under the
clear protection of the First
Amendment. Ineffective protest
becomes the only safe protest.
No Jury Trial
But other effects, more
distinctively fascistic in nature,

Jim o'fallon

must also be exposed. First, the
injunction operates to deny the
right to a trial by jury for acts
where that right normally obtains.
In an essentially summary
proceeding before a judge, a
person may receive as much as 6
months in jail and a $500 fine for
contempt of court.
Secondly, by specifically
naming certain individuals and the
Venceremos organization, it
denies them the right to engage in
any type of protest on the
Stanford 'campus. As the John
Does are replaced by real names,
the same provisions come into
effect against those people.
A quick perusal of the names,
together with some knowledge of
recent events here, allows one to
see the purpose of this provision.
The university has identified these
people as leaders through their
participation in actions and their
strong work to expose the extent
of Stanford's complicity in the
war. By removing this leadership
they believe they will succeed in
destroying the movement.
A special word is relevant to
the Venceremos organization. The
university has attempted to set up
this organization as the primary
threat to the University, thereby
obscuring that the threat comes
from the rightful rage of the
people at the complictous acts of
the university.
Scapegoating
The logical conclusion of such
scapegoating under fascism is
shown by German extermination
of Jews, and the current program
against the Black Panther Party.
We should remember the effective
tactic of the Danes during World
War 11, when the mass of the
pec pie became Jews, wearing the
required insignia.
Our response to the injunction
should be clear. We must not
allow the university to impose the
role of impotent protestors on us.
We must confront Lyman with
the fact that we know we are all
John Does, and will not allow
ourselves to be intimidated from
the path of effective protest.
Further, we must show our
solidarity with our brothers and
sisters in the struggle who stand
most exposed to the latest wave
of fascism at Stanford.

of fascism at Stanford.
Free John Doe. Free All
Political Prisoners.

Recent events on the Stanford
campus once again illuminate the
inextricable connections between
continued prosecution of
genocidal war against the people
of Southeast Asia and trowing
fascism at home.
The people of the United
States have voiced their
opposition to the war, and have
demanded that it be ended. The
ruling class is confronted with an
unavoidable contradiction. To
continue the war is to pour fuel
on the steadily growing
revolutionary flame at home,
which is tearing away the mask of
corporate liberalism from the
ruling class and baring the true
exploitive nature of our society.
Yet to end the war at this
point (or at any point short of
reducing the indigenous
population of Vietnam to Thieu,
Ky and their American
bodyguards) is to sacrifice the
economic advantages of
ownership of the Third World,
which the ruling class so
desperately needs to maintain its
grip at home.

In seeking to avoid the
necessary results of this
contradiction, the federal
administration has chosen a
two-pronged strategy. First, it has
attempted to throw a
smokescreen over what is
happening in Indochina. The
illusion, that the war is being
ended, is maintained by
withdrawal of U.S. ground troops,
while destruction and death is
escalated by massive increases in
the application of technological
warfare.
Nixon Doctrine
The technological increase is
itself covered by the assertion that
we are "protecting American
boys" as they prepare to leave
Vietnam. The Nixon doctrine is in
full bloom here, for all to see. In
plain language, it is that no longer
may American lives be sacrificed
to serve our ruling class interests
in the Third World.
Rather, we will use Asians to
kill Asians, Arabs to kill Arabs,
Africans to kill Africans, but still
in support of the same interests.
In light of recent happenings in
Laos, it is clear that we will soon
be training the ARVN to fly our
helicopters.
The second prong of the
strategy, diffusion and/or
repression of anti-war activity at
home, is evidenced by a number
of things. The most obvious, but
perhaps easiest disregarded, is the
conjunction of the invasion of
Laos with Apollo 14 .
The invasion was begun before
the end of the monsoon, imposing
tremendous logistical difficulties
on the invading forces. It is hard
to imagine any reason for such an
egregious tactical error, other than
considerations of lessening the
impact at home by taking
advantage of a major attention
diverting event. This conclusion is
buttressed by the way news of the
invasion was managed to avoid
sudden full intrusion on our
consciousness.
News Management
The second diffusing tactic has
been management of news. The
mutually supportive effect
of reactions on campuses and in
communities across the country
last May was not missed by the
administration. True, the current
reaction has not approached the
level of last May. But from the
owners of the "free press" one
would get the idea that there has
been no reaction.
We know from other sources
that opposition has begun
mobilization across the country.
We also know that New York
receives no news about California,
except what is obtained through
friends of the Liberation News
Service. Either newspapers have
suddenly rejected a long-standing
tradition of sensationalized
journalism, or the word is out to
keep it quiet.
Here we are experiencing the

more open tactic of direct
repression, an injunction against
certain named individuals, the
Venceremos organization, and one
thousand John Does. It is sought
to be justified as necessary to
maintain the University as "an
open forum." Taken in the
context of what has happened
here, it is clear that it was
obtained for other reasons, and
serves an exactly contrary
purpose.
Richard Lyman has stated that
if the war could be ended by
anguished letters from college
presidents, it would be over by
now. He understands, as do we,
that it cannot be ended in that
way. He has not examined the
paths open to a university
president which might help end
the war, because they pose a
threat to the university.
University Complicity
We know that University
support through research and
applied technology has been vital
to the U.S. war effort, particularly
as it has shifted to a highly
technological form. Action by the
president to end this complicity
would result in the loss of
government money, and
contributions from big war
profiteers. When presented with
the alternative of helping
effectively to end the war, or
preserving the institution, Richard
Lyman choses his job over the
lives of a few million Asians.
Having made this choice, the
rest is easy. Beginning with the
Lodge demonstration, some
members of the Stanford
community once again asserted
their refusal to be bound to
ineffective protest and exercises in
futility. These actions were at first
met with the relatively meager
repressive means of the
University, i.e. SJC proceedings.
February 10 a move was made
against the computation center.
Out of concern for their $5
million machine, the University
administrators were forced to
withdraw use of the facility from
an SRI program which planned
invasions of Indochina. Such
effective protests could not be
tolerated, and the University
moved to bring in the additional
repressive strength of the legal
system by obtaining the
injunction.
As shown elsewhere (The
Liberated Daily) a major value of
the injunction is fear. By
obscuring the relatively clear
distinctions between legal and
illegal acts it operates to make
people overly cautious about the
way they protest the war. It casts
a pall of uncertainty over actions
which normally are under the
clear protection of the First
Amendment. Ineffective protest
becomes the only safe protest.
No Jury Trial
But other effects, more
distinctively fascistic in nature,

Jim o'fallon

must also be exposed. First, the
injunction operates to deny the
right to a trial by jury for acts
where that right normally obtains.
In an essentially summary
proceeding before a judge, a
person may receive as much as 6
months in jail and a $500 fine for
contempt of court.
Secondly, by specifically
naming certain individuals and the
Venceremos organization, it
denies them the right to engage in
any type of protest on the
Stanford 'campus. As the John
Does are replaced by real names,
the same provisions come into
effect against those people.
A quick perusal of the names,
together with some knowledge of
recent events here, allows one to
see the purpose of this provision.
The university has identified these
people as leaders through their
participation in actions and their
strong work to expose the extent
of Stanford's complicity in the
war. By removing this leadership
they believe they will succeed in
destroying the movement.
A special word is relevant to
the Venceremos organization. The
university has attempted to set up
this organization as the primary
threat to the University, thereby
obscuring that the threat comes
from the rightful rage of the
people at the complictous acts of
the university.
Scapegoating
The logical conclusion of such
scapegoating under fascism is
shown by German extermination
of Jews, and the current program
against the Black Panther Party.
We should remember the effective
tactic of the Danes during World
War 11, when the mass of the
pec pie became Jews, wearing the
required insignia.
Our response to the injunction
should be clear. We must not
allow the university to impose the
role of impotent protestors on us.
We must confront Lyman with
the fact that we know we are all
John Does, and will not allow
ourselves to be intimidated from
the path of effective protest.
Further, we must show our
solidarity with our brothers and
sisters in the struggle who stand
most exposed to the latest wave
of fascism at Stanford.
