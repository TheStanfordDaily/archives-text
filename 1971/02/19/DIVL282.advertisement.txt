pollution
is also a
state of
mind.
We hear a lot about
pollution of air and water.
But what about mental
pollution? Could it affect
the environment we
live in?
Perhaps the answer to
dirty rivers and smoggy
air is purer thinking ...
more spiritual thinking
that eliminates the greed
and self-will that cloud
our thoughts.
To learn more about
fighting mental pollution,
come hear a talk by
Grace Bemis Curtis, a
teacher and practitioner
of Christian Science,
called "Let's Choose
Heaven Here."
