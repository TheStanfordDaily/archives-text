## Justice: 'A Monstrous Lie' 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
"Law is irrelevant for those people
who may need it most," civil rights
attorney William Kunstler told an
overflow audience of 4 00 in Bishop
Auditorium yesterday afternoon.
For millions of Americans—people
of color and the revered
tradition of equal justice under the law
is "an absolute, monstrous lie," he said.
Appearing on a panel sponsored by
the Stanford Law Forum with Kunstler
were law professors Anthony
Amsterdam, John Kaplan and Wayne
Barnett. Beginning with a short
statement, Kunstler told the crowd,
"My greatest grievance about the law
itself is that it is essentially a collection
of myths and illusions, and
unfortunately they are myths and
illusions that people live by. And I
guess the chief myth is that it is a
reasonable approximation to truth and
justice. This is its most sublime lie.
Trappings of Justice
"I think society has made a
fundamental decision that poor people
are to be put in a certain category that
they ought to be treated with the

trappings ol justice and without the
substance."
Barnett responded by
acknowledging the faults of the legal
system, but said, "To castigate the
system because it does not produce
right, just results seems to me only to
describe the human condition."
He then asked Kunstler how he
could justify the defense in the Chicago
seven trial.
"The Chicago trial was not a
disruption," responded Kunstler, "It
was one of the most expeditions
political trials in American history." Of
612 trial hours, "something less than 3
were spent in some sort of disruptive
conflict," according to Kunstler.
Trial Boring
"To me," he said, "the trial was
most of the time rather boring—most of
the time hum drum . ..
"When the noose is tightening it's
your obligation to stand up and do
something about it. The courtroom
itself should become an arena and a
forum," he said.
"I don't claim at any level that the
system works well," said Barnett, "but
none of this is responsive to the
question whether one is justified in
attacking the system to destroy it
without any effort to state what is to
replace it. To condemn it and say it is
bad is not to say anything."
Kaplan seemed to agree with
Barnett's analysis in saying, "Look at
the way other countries to it . . . They
all have the same imperfections. It's
very hard to find a model social system
made out of such crummy raw
materials..."
Amsterdam, however, seemed to
side with Kunstler. The Chicago trial
"demonstrated defects of the system to
those who hadn't yet gone through
disillusionment with it,"he said.
"In this sytem, at this time, we are
not committing random errors, we are
consistently screwing certain people."
He continued, "When society has
reached a level at which things are truly
intolerable it may well be that you start
ripping before you have something to
replace it with.

"Some no n - revolutionary
governments get bad enough so that the
next step, even on the basis of pure
logic, is to say, Damn it. I don't know
and I don't care. I can't design what
comes next, but this is so bad that the
time to break this one is now."
Revolution not Near
Kaplan responded, "The question is,
where are we now? It smells pretty
bad . . . but I'm willing to stick it out.
It (the revolution) is not near to
coming here for one reason—the guns
are in the hands of the other guys."
Speaking of the repression which
might come from the right, he said, "I
believe the courts are a protection in
this country. If the sovereign people
could do what they want things would
be a whole lot worse."
Shortly thereafter the discussion was
interrupted by an unidentified black
student who castigated the panel for
their "intellectual jive-ass bullshit."
Although he was booed and hissed at
first, the student was allowed to go on
and speak.
"Either you're with me or you trip
me," he said, "and that's what it boils
down to. All this jive time shit you
been doing, intellectualizing ain't going
to do nothing. If you ain't going to
come up with something concrete,
don't say shit at all.. .
"And if it takes a bomb to blow up
the U.S. Senate to change the
motherfucking system, then I am for
it."
From then on the entire tone of the
discussion changed.
Another black, who said he was
from East St. Louis, said he could
understand the feelings of his
"brother." "Today's discussion is an
intellectualization of the problem, and
is so far removed from the problem
that it becomes worse than useless. It's
a discussion that can only be engaged in
by the priveleged class. When people
are confronted with the oppressed
people, and not the intellectualization,
they can't face it."
Said Kunstler, "I was aghast that we
hissed a man that made us feel

uncomfortable and afraid. It was raw
and naked and was right here and we
couldn't face it... We have not
expressed anger, here, but a great
intellectualization of the problem.
Maybe what you need is both."
One student then stood up and said,
"I hissed because . . . there was anger,
but it was not constructive. I'm not in
favor of going out and shooting and
bombing."
Kunstler replied, "What I received
was a bitter rage ... We were afraid of

that anger. 1 think that was the best
thing that was said here today."
Amsterdam responded saying, "It's
not enough to sit here and debate the
question. The time for debate has run.
I'm not going to throw a bomb, but I'm,
god damn uncomfortable about that
decision, because I'm not sure it is
right."
"What he was asking for is a
commitment. The time for debate is
over, and we've got to decide which
side we're on .. You don't debate a

revolution—you have a revolution.
Although debate helps to crystalize
issues, the problem is it may become a
narcotic, a sop ..."
Amsterdam reiterated that he was
not a revolutionary, but said again that
he was certainly not comfortable about
his decision. Kunstler answered by
saying, "I'm ambivalent as to which
side I'm on. I'm not sure I won't throw
a bomb, or I will. When the time
comes, I hope I'll do the right thing for
y>
me.
