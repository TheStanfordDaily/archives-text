This is a letter by English
Department Chairman lan Wall to
Bruce Franklin. It uvs released by
Bruce Franklin.
1 have to answer the following
query from Albert Hastorf, Dean
of Humanities and Sciences:
"It has been brought to my
attention that when there is a
rally in the Plaza or some other
location that the class (English
270 B) is not held; there is no one
in the room. On Wednesday, the
10 of February, there was a note
on the door saying that the class
would meet in front of the
Computation Center. I am most
disturbed by this allegation. If it is
true, I would consider it a severe
breach of professorial ethics. I
would very much appreciate your
exploring this with Professor
Franklin and informing me of the
outcome."
My understanding is that what
Hastorf says is true: that the class
did not meet on several occasions
when there were rallies either on
White Plaza or, in one case, in
Redwood City. I also believe that
although you gave me the
impression on Thursday that there
would be "section meetings" last
Friday, February 12, there were
in fact no class sections. Once
again I would like to know if my
understanding is right.
I hope that, whatever our
misunderstandings, you
understand that I do not relish my
present role; and I can assure you
that on many occasions, and
especially when dealing with the
press, 1 have refrained from
denying statements which you
made which I personally regarded
as mistaken or incomplete. But I
wished, and still wish, to preserve
the maximum public decorum,
and I think of this as being in
your interests as well as those of
the Department.

This is Bruce Franklin s
response.
Fd greatly appreciate it if you

would dry your crocodile tears
and stop trying to bite me from
behind while Fm trying to meet
my moral, legal, and political
obligations to my students. As
you well know, I have
consistently met all my classes
that 1 could, and made provisions
for them to meet when 1 could
not, despite the efforts, first of
you, and then of the
administration and you, to
interfere with the class.
The allegation made by Dean
Hastorf and supported by you
that "when there is a rally in the
Plaza or some other location that
the class (270 B) is not held; there
is no one in the room" is not only
a false accusation but a despicable
one. You stoop to your lowest
when you claim that your
"understanding is that what
Hastorf says is true: that the class
did not meet on several occasions
when there were rallies either on
White Plaza or, in one case, in
Redwood City." Despite the fact
that I have been sick
intermittently since the quarter
began, every class prior to .January
25th was held. On that morning
there was a peaceful rally and
march in support of Los Siete in
Redwood City. Without
provocation, I was attacked by
several uniformed members of the
San Mateo County Sheriff's
Department, clubbed to the
ground, and beaten while lying in
the street. I was then handcuffed
and taken to jail. While being
booked, I was allowed to make
two phone calls. I made the first
to a lawyer. Instead of using the
second to reassure my wife and
children that I was not injured, I
placed the second to the English
Department secretary, to make
sure that the class scheduled for

that afternoon would meet, and
told her, while the police were
forcing me to hang up, that I had
asked the lawyer's office to help
find a replacement teacher for the
class. The class met as scheduled
and was taught by Aaron
Manga niello, Director of
Venceremos College. Many
students later told me that it was
one of the most important
educational experiences of their
lives. The following day you took
it upon yourself to cancel the
class, despite my instructions to
the contrary. During the hour that
the class met, I was being
arraigned in court. 1 was brought
in with a heavy chain around my
waist, my wrists were handcuffed
to that chain, and leg irons were
attached to my ankles, fastened so
tight that they cut through the
skin. Since 1 could not come to
the class, I had asked the class to
come to meet me. Many did. This
was the only occasion when the
class did not meet in the usual
room because of any event in
Redwood City.
The next scheduled class that
did not meet as usual was on
Tuesday, February 9th. On that
day, the Stanford Judicial Council
had scheduled a hearing to begin
at 12:30 p.m. The entire Defense
Collective had vigorously
protested this hour to the SJC,
pointing out that I was a defense
counsel and was supposed to meet
my class at this time, and that five
of the defendants were registered
students in that class. When the
hearing began, we made formal
motion that future sessions be
held in the evening to avoid this
conflict.
The only other scheduled class
that did not meet at the usual

time and place was on Wednesday,
February 10 th. On that day, 1
went to the classroom at 1 :15, the
appropriate time, and discovered
that there were no more than ten
(at the most) of the registered 150
students in the room. Most of the
rest had gone on the march to the
computation center. In order to
meet the class, 1 put a note on the
blackboard stating that the class
would meet outside the
computation center, and I then
walked over there. The question
of whether a professor has a right
to schedule a class meeting
outside a building in which a
demonstration is going on came
up in 1968 , when Lyman
attempted to reprimand me for
having a class on the lawn of
Encina while an anti-CIA
demonstration was taking place
inside the building. At that time
the officers of the local chapter of
the AAIJP made it very clear that
1 was in no way subject to
reprimand for doing this.
To petty vindictiveness and
hostility which you have toward
me comes through your kindly
mask pretty clearly when you
accuse me of having given you
"the impression on Thursday that
there would be 'section meetings'
last Friday, February 12," when
"there were in fact no class
sections.' As you ought to know,
the class is scheduled to meet
Monday through Thursday, not
Friday, and I never indicated to
you that it would meet in any
form on any Friday. The class had
decided in the first week of the
course to i:ave small section
meetings regularly on Thursdays
and I did mention this to you.
...Play your counter-insurgency
role as you must. But please stop
trying to pretend that you're
doing it partly in my interest.
Surely you are familiar enough
with the literature of the
eighteenth century to know what
kind of caricature that resembles.
Bruce Franklin
