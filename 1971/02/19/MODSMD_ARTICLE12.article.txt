# do something creative and imaginative
## Human Values In A Time Of Crisis 
### 
David thompgon

The recent events on campus remind me of
a recent Jules Feifer cartoon, whose subtitles
read:
I occupy buildings; Raid Files; Scream
Obscenities; Throw Rocks; And call cops Pigs;
In an attempt to humanize this brutalized
society.
I share some of the more violent students'
disgust over Nixon's indirect invasion of Laos
with American equipment, aircraft, spotters,
pilots, weapons, ammunition, etc., and his
using the South Vietnamese Army as a tool to
circumvent the expressed wishes of our
Congress.
Values
Bit we need to keep in mind, as humans
and as a university of humans, the values
underlying the behavior we exhibit and
observe. And it seems hypocritical to try to
turn the administration's violent policies in
Indochina around with violent activities. To do
so is to say violence is a good, effective
weapon.
Instead, we need to say to Nixon and the
American people who follow him that violence,
aggressive, offensive violence is wrong, not by
imitating it through trashing property and
stoning people, but by finding creative
alternatives. Besides, if imitation is the greatest
compliment, why should we compliment
Nixon?

Moreover, I feel it is not appropriate for
speakers to suggest solutions, violent or
otherwise, when they represent one to two
percent of a campus body which is itself a
small societal minority, and say they speak "in
the name of the people." They don't any more
than I do. The ones I have heard recently
simply represent a small minority whom the
majority of workers and other citizens I know
look upon, rightly or wrongly, as angry, rich,
spoiled brats.
Creative Alternatives
Many individuals and committees have been
studying creative alternatives around campus
for more than a year. These vary from political
action including community meetings to
making a film dramatizing the message and the
feelings associated with it. It's difficult to say
whether or not these or any other creative,
active, agressive, and non-violent approach
would work, since we all haven't ever tried it
in the face of difficult problems. But it seems
clear to me that we need more good vibes
between us all if we're going to accomplish
anything constructive.
Some people seem to prefer violent
"solutions" to problems and prefer a Marxian
approach to a Ghandian one, for reasons that
perhaps they could explain to me. But I feel
violence is a communicable disease that is
counter-productive, and permits moral concern

and persuasion to be perverted into moral
judgement and punishment.
If you feel income should be redistributed,
education reformed, ownership patterns
altered, unemployment practices changed,
political power adjusted, etc., do something
about it—as creative and imaginative as
possible rather than violent and destructive.
We are in the midst of a mixture of revolutions
now—biotechnical, abundance, space, sexual,
computer, race, etc.—so pick the one you want
a part of and do your thing. Part of the
Aquarian Age seems to be a revolution in the
way revolutions are conducted—an expanding,
adaptive nourishing evolution, sensitive to the
humanity in all of us, rather than a rending,
tearing down of "the establishment."
What we must struggle with is the very
difficult task of how to analyze where we are
and what we have to work with, synthsize an
appropriate purpose for this nation collectively
and for each of us individually, and then to be
creative and resourceful enough to accomplish
these goals.
This is perhaps the greatest challenge our
people have faced, but we are a capable,
creative nation, and I suggest, up to the
challenge. We may even learn that, in all
things, literally and figuratively, "let him who
is without sin cast the first stone."

Some people seem to prefer violent
"solutions" to problems and prefer a Marxian
approach to a Ghandian one, for reasons that
perhaps they could explain to me. But I feel
violence is a communicable disease that is
counter-productive, and permits moral concern

and persuasion to be perverted into moral
judgement and punishment.
If you feel income should be redistributed,
education reformed, ownership patterns
altered, unemployment practices changed,
political power adjusted, etc., do something
about it—as creative and imaginative as
possible rather than violent and destructive.
We are in the midst of a mixture of revolutions
now—biotechnical, abundance, space, sexual,
computer, race, etc.—so pick the one you want
a part of and do your thing. Part of the
Aquarian Age seems to be a revolution in the
way revolutions are conducted—an expanding,
adaptive nourishing evolution, sensitive to the
humanity in all of us, rather than a rending,
tearing down of "the establishment."
What we must struggle with is the very
difficult task of how to analyze where we are
and what we have to work with, synthsize an
appropriate purpose for this nation collectively
and for each of us individually, and then to be
creative and resourceful enough to accomplish
these goals.
This is perhaps the greatest challenge our
people have faced, but we are a capable,
creative nation, and I suggest, up to the
challenge. We may even learn that, in all
things, literally and figuratively, "let him who
is without sin cast the first stone."

The recent events on campus remind me of
a recent Jules Feifer cartoon, whose subtitles
read:
I occupy buildings; Raid Files; Scream
Obscenities; Throw Rocks; And call cops Pigs;
In an attempt to humanize this brutalized
society.
I share some of the more violent students'
disgust over Nixon's indirect invasion of Laos
with American equipment, aircraft, spotters,
pilots, weapons, ammunition, etc., and his
using the South Vietnamese Army as a tool to
circumvent the expressed wishes of our
Congress.
Values
Bit we need to keep in mind, as humans
and as a university of humans, the values
underlying the behavior we exhibit and
observe. And it seems hypocritical to try to
turn the administration's violent policies in
Indochina around with violent activities. To do
so is to say violence is a good, effective
weapon.
Instead, we need to say to Nixon and the
American people who follow him that violence,
aggressive, offensive violence is wrong, not by
imitating it through trashing property and
stoning people, but by finding creative
alternatives. Besides, if imitation is the greatest
compliment, why should we compliment
Nixon?

Moreover, I feel it is not appropriate for
speakers to suggest solutions, violent or
otherwise, when they represent one to two
percent of a campus body which is itself a
small societal minority, and say they speak "in
the name of the people." They don't any more
than I do. The ones I have heard recently
simply represent a small minority whom the
majority of workers and other citizens I know
look upon, rightly or wrongly, as angry, rich,
spoiled brats.
Creative Alternatives
Many individuals and committees have been
studying creative alternatives around campus
for more than a year. These vary from political
action including community meetings to
making a film dramatizing the message and the
feelings associated with it. It's difficult to say
whether or not these or any other creative,
active, agressive, and non-violent approach
would work, since we all haven't ever tried it
in the face of difficult problems. But it seems
clear to me that we need more good vibes
between us all if we're going to accomplish
anything constructive.
