# Center Focuses On Local Problems
## 
### KATHLEEN MORTON 
The issues of housing discrimination, ecology and legal aid have
sparked genuine concern among many students. But a common
complaint among these individuals has been the lack of effective
channels through which constructive attempts to resolve these issues
can be made.
The Project Information Center (PIC), located above the Nitery in
the Old Union was organized this fall to direct students concerned
about community problem solving to issue-oriented projects in their
area of interest.
"The emphasis is on immediate involvement," said Karen Stone
who runs PIC. "We want to get people into the community, active, as
soon as possible. Most people don't know how much they can do to
change things."
PIC Purpose
Its purpose, according to Tracy Bliss, organizer of the center is to
involve students in the community as closely as possible. It
concentrates on making people aware of constructive ways to deal
with urban problems and how they, personally, can effect change.
PIC projects are an ideal way to exert influence in the areas of
concern to most students. A student need only walk into the office,
explain his area of interest, and he will receive information on related
projects, their content, and whom to contact.
"We also want students to get an idea of what community
problems are like, and what it's like to deal with them before
graduation so it's not so much of a shock when they are finally
confronted with them," Stone added.
Where did the idea for the Center come from?
Formerly, there was a Volunteer Service Center which handled
more traditional volunteer projects such as tutoring, VISTA, Peace
Corps, and working with retarded children. PIC was set up specifically
for students interested in involvement in more political and
issue-oriented spheres.
Long-Term Committment
"Groups are boycotting in the communities," says Bliss, "but we
want to drive home the point that change requires a real long-term
commitment, and not a short-term rage reaction. People have to be
willing to commit themselves."
The Center handles a wide spectrum of projects—from challenging
tutorials for gifted children to research groups for unfair housing:
—The Mid-Peninsula Fair Housing League needs volunteers to look
for discrimination and check on standards in low cost housing. Tired
of hearing about unfair housing practices? This is a chance to do
something about it.
—Interested in crime prevention and treatment? "Friends Outside"
works with families of prison inmates, acting as tutors for the children
or merely as a stabilizing influence for the family. The San Mateo
County Service League has a project designed to prevent crime and
reduce the number of offenders.
Credit may even be obtained for many of these projects through
SCIRE, which handles many similar projects.
"It's a new wave in education, a new way to get into the
community," says Stone. "Education is in the community as much as
in the classroom. This gives people a chance to get out of the Ivory
Tower and apply what they know."
