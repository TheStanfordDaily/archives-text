The following text includes the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council's (SCLS) first passage of
two legislative proposals. One
concerns social regulations and
the other deals with the
possession of dangerous weapons.
Anyone who desires to comment
upon this legislation should direct
his opinion, in writing, to
Professor Konrad Krauskopf,
Chairman SCLC, c/o Geology

Proposed Legislation
On Social Regulations
All university regulations

heretofore cognizable by the
Stanford Judicial Council
governing sign-out procedures,
visiting hours, and dress on the
Stanford home campus are
abolished.
Limitations:
(1) Notwithstanding the above,
residence in individual units will
be limited to those students who
have contracted for them.
(2) Individual residence units
may, by majority vote of all
members taken by secret ballot,
establish limits on visiting hours
and other social regulations for
their residences. Violation of such

regulations is an offense
cognizable by the Stanford
Judicial Council, provided that
the regulations have first been
submitted to and approved by the
Student Conduct Legislative
Council.
(3) This legislation does not
alter the scope of the
Fundamental Standard.

CUTTING BACK-In an effort to save $40,000, Tresidder will
eliminate check-cashing services and cutback on others starting March
1. Although lounges, meeting rooms, and other upstairs facilities can
still be used free of charge Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10
p.m., special arrangements including identifiable costs must be made
for weekend use. The Tresidder cafeteria will be affected by the
cutback, with new 7 :30 a.m. to 7 p.m. hours, 7 days a week. The
barber shop, coffee shop, store, and travel service will continue their
present schedule of operations.
