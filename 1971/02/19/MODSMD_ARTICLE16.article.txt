# Penn Film Heads Year's Best
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Although best ten lists are
already a bit out of season, I've
decided to run my list now both
as a curiosity item and because
the practical reality of limited
space has prevented many of these
films from getting their critical
due.
Overall, 1970 was a distressing
year but not quite as bad as 1969,
when I was hard-pressed to come
up with any list at all. The most
remarkable thing about the year
was that so many prestigious
directors (among them, Fellini,
Hawks, Antonioni, Wilder,
Bunuel, Wyler, Mankiewicz,
Minelli, Preminger and Stevens)
had films in release at
approximately the same time. In
most cases, however, the films
failed to live up to their directors'
reputations.
At any rate, here are the best
films of the year, in relative order
of excellence:
LITTLE BIG MAN was the
year's one truly great film and
certainly Arthur Penn's most
outstanding effort to date. The
film succeeds as an epic in that it

manages to present a full-bodied
and richly textured picture of an
epoch. It is compassionately
human and humane and is
repeatedly extremely moving. I've
been somewhat upset at the
mixed critical reaction to the film,
but I guess it's the fate of all great
films to be controversial.
MA NUIT CHEZ MAUI). 1 first
raved about this film when it was
shown at the San Francisco Film
Festival in 1969 and the
subsequent critical and popular
reaction has been substantial
enough to bring Eric Rohmer
overdue recognition. Jean-Louis
Trintignant and Francoise Fabian
are most engaging in this witty
but penetrating examination of
social mores and the barriers men
and women set up between
themselves. Rohmer's latest work,
"Le Genou de Claire," is currently
a major success in Paris.
THE BALLAD OF CABLE
HOGUE, Sam Peckinpah's best
film yet, doesn't call attention to
itself to the extent that "The Wild
Bunch" did and emerges all the
better for it. Quite tender and
surprisingly humorous, "Cable
Hogue" has developed as a cause
for cultists mainly because, as is
usually the case with Peckinpah,
the studio grossly undersold the
project.
TRISTANA. At this point in
his career, Luis Bunuel seems able
to effortlessly turn out
masterpieces and "Tristana"
comes close to the brilliance of
"Belle de Jour." Though the
surface story is absorbing enough
in itself, the tale can also be seen

as a subtle allegory on Spanish
history during Bunuel's lifetime.
A complex, many-layered
achievement.
MISSISSIPPI MEKMAID.
Francois Truffaut's much
maligned drama was accused of
being unconvincing and
ill-motivated by its detractors.
Actually, it is Truffaut's most
personal film since "The 4 00
Blows," encompassing his love of
the cinema through many detailed
references to other movies and his
love for women through the
appearance of Truffaut's own
inamorata, Catherine Deneuve. A
fascinating film which I will
always champion.
WOMEN IN LOVE. Ken
Russell does have a tendency to
go overboard, but this, particular
project was ambitions enough to
support the director's occasional
excesses. The film's treatment of
sensuality and sexuality
notwithstanding, it succeeds in
being so exciting basically because
of the performances and Russell's
ability to find a visual style
rigorous enough to complement
the Lawrentian prose and motifs.
LOVE IS A FUNNY THING is
probably the best picture so far
by one of the cinema's few
remaining unabashed romantics,
Claude Lelouch. Belmondo is
great fun to watch cavorting
through incongruous American
landscapes and it is encouraging as
well that Lelouch never lapses
into mindless pictorialism.
DIARY OF A MAD
HOUSEWIFE. Carrie Snodgress
gives such an extraordinary
performance (by far the year's
best) that the film itself could
have been substantially worse and
it still would have been a strong
experience. On the other hand,
Richard Benjamin gives an
atrocious performance but it
ultimately works in the picture's
favor (I can still hear "How 'bout
a leetle roll in 'de hay"
reverberating painfully in my
memory).
THE PRIVATE LIFE OF
SHERLOCK HOLMES starts off

as a very clever comedy but
ultimately emerges as a very
melancholy, wistful experience as
Holmes retreats behind closed
doors with his cocaine to alleviate
the pain brought on by his failed
private life. Though it certainly
succeeds as entertainment, the
film Ls also one of Billy Wilder's
most personal and is all the more
touching coming from a director
who traditionally seems so
detached and cynical.
L'ENFANT SAUVAGE. Very
curiousiy for a Truffaut film, I
don't so much like "L 4 Enfant
Sauvage" as I respect and admire
it. Especially praiseworthy is the
restrained, classical style IYuffaut
assumes for the picture and his
almost revolutionary decision to
shoot in black-and-white.
Other films I liked over the
past year were Mankiewicz'
"There Was a Crooked Man,"
Hussein's "Quackser Fortune Has
a Cousin in the Bronx,"
Costa-Gavras' "L'aveu" ("The
Confession"), Roeg-Cammell's
"Performance," Altaian's
"Brewster McCloud" and
"M*A*S*H," "Rio Lobo," Petri's
"Investigation of a Citizen Above
Suspicion," Chabrol's "This Man
Must Die," Deßroca's "Les
Caprices De Marie" ("Give Her
the Moon") and Robert Kramer's
"Ice."

DIRECTOR OF THE YEAR—this year Arthur Penn reached new
personal heights with the staggering "Little Big Man," one of the very
few commendable American films of the year. The film opened
recently at the Northpoint in San Francisco.
