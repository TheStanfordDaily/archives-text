# Wild Operetta Satirizes Hell
## 
### 
There have been many tellings
of the "Orpheus" legend, but
Jacques Offenbach's comic
operetta "Orpheus in the Under
world" is probably the first to use
can-can music to entertain the
denizens of Hades.
The winter production of the
Stanford Opera Theater is a lively,
tuneful, satiric operetta, a
"French farce with music," in
which the gods stage a revolution,
Orpheus and Eurydice's marriage
is on the rocks, and life in Hell is
one long wild, high-kicking dance.
As stage director Michel

Langineux remarked, "Anything
can happen in the Underworld."
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
will have four performances,
Wednesday through Saturday
(February 24 through February
27) at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. All seats are reserved.
Tickets are available at Tresidder.
The Stanford Symphony
Orchestra, conducted by Professor
Sandor Salgo, will provide the
music. Principal singers include
Rosemary Morrison and Pamela
Erickson, alternating in the role of
Eurydice; Anthony Antolini, as
Orpheus; James Mason as Pluto,
and Mark Clemens as Jupiter.
Vocal coach is Marie Gibson,
and Professor Harold Schmidt is
chorusmaster of the Stanford
Opera Chorus.
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
is perhaps the most elaborate
production to be mounted by the
Music Department in recent years.

The settings of Mt. Olympus and
the Underworld offer a visual and
a theatrical challenge, and the
Opera Theater has responded with
a kaleidoscopic multi-media
display that uses mime, dance,
fluorescent color, black light,
body paint and projections to
enhance the music of Offenbach.
Central to the production, and
an innovation in opera training at
Stanford, are Michel Langineux's
yoga-based movement classes in
which the "gods" learn to move in
a graceful, stylized manner, the
principal characters develop the
precision and beauty of
movement that are essential to
opera, and a third group prepares
a wild mime sequence to
accompany Orpheus' descent in
Hell.
Rhonda Martyn, a freshman,
choreographed all those can-can
dancers, while Peggy Tonkonogy
designed the sets and costumes.
