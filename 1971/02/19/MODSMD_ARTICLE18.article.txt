# Show Evokes Spirit Of Century's Turn
## 
### STU ALLEN 
If you've ever felt the impulse
to collect an audience and
entertain them singlehandedly for
several hours by playing the nose
flute, you should see Max Morath.
"At the Turn of the Century"
is a one man revue of the
controversies and tumult of the
two or three decades
encompassing man's progress into
the twentieth century. Max
Morath plays the piano, sings,
acts, lectures, and dances while he
shows the audience how the
generation gap existed before
anyone thought to invent it.
Primarily through the medium
of music, Morath chronicles the
"revolutions" of ragtime music,
prohibition, and suffrage. History
can be enlightening when so
entertainingly presented: the
audience learns of a time when
alcohol was illegal but marijuana
was not.
Musical Philosopher
The progression from one
fashion to the next often leads us
to the illusion that people are
changing and a welcome (or
frightening) new day is on the
horizon. Morath weaves this
philosophic matter excellently
through his show.

He concludes by singing that
the new day — tomorrow—may be
your last, so why not "let the joy
come through?"
Max Morath is a unique figure
in show business because he is
both well-versed historically and
accomplished as a performer.
When he is playing "Tiger Rag" or
singing "The Grizzly Bear" one
can only marvel at the delight of
Max Morath at the piano. He
shuns microphones in his lusty
approach to this music, making it
a friendly, intimate experience.
Loses Spontaneity
In knotting together the
various aspects of the show,
however, Morath falls down
somewhat. Maybe it is because he
has been touring with this act for
two years, or just because he aims
for middle-aged audiences. At any
rate, he occasionally comes off
too polished and slick to sustain
the spontaneity that flows from
his music.
Morath's buoyant singing at
the piano overshadows his acting,
making the second act tedious.
After intermission, a let-down is
apparent, for the show seems to
be stretched too thin. The second
act doesn't break ground in
territories as exciting as those
explored in the first. There are
moments of brilliance in the
second half also; but overall,
Morath's ragtime music dominates
in providing entertaining insight
into ourselves and our
grandfathers.
Max Morath in "At the Turn of
the Century" will be at the
Marines Memorial Theater
through February 27. Student
rush is available 1 /2 hour before
the curtain.

LOW TlDE—Unhassle yourself this weekend. The beach is where it
isn't at, which can be really nice.
