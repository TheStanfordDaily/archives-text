# Judge Extends Restraining Order
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Seven defendants, served with a
temporary restraining order (TRO)
which the University obtained last
Friday, were granted a continuance of
their case until March 1 by Superior
Court judge Stanley R. Evans.
Evans also ruled that the seven who
have already been served will be subject
to the TRO at least until the new trial
date.
Attorneys for the University
obtained another TRO yesterday, after
Evans absolved 10 of the 1 7 defendants
from the original order. The 10 had not
been served notice of the document at
least two days prior to the hearing - the
legal time limit for the order to be
considered binding.
Evans was presiding over the first
session of a "show cause" hearing at
the Santa Clara County courthouse in
which Stanford attorneys are seeking to
replace the TRO with a preliminary
injunction that would bar the named
defendants from participating in
actions which the restraining order
forbids. Such an injunction would also
enjoin non-students named in the TRO
from being present on the Stanford
campus.
At the Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday, President Lyman charged
some elements within the University
with exerting "very energetic efforts to
confuse the issue "of the injunction,
and maintained that there are wide
"misconceptions" of the John Does
mentioned in the TRO.
Lyman explained that defendants
would be added to the TRO or, if

obtained, the preliminary injunction as
a John Does "only if the people can be
proved to have done something named
as illegal in the TRO between January
11 (the date of the Lodge disruption)
and the date of the issuance of the
TRO."
Enjoined From Aiding
While this interpretation prevents
individuals from being threatened by
John Does if commissions of "illegal"
acts did not occur on or between
January 11 and February 12, Lyman
added that all people are "enjoined"
from aiding any of those names in the
injunction in the performance of any of
the acts prohibited by the TRO.
Lyman also noted that Professor
Bruce Franklin has until February 25
to reply to the charges for which he
was cited last Friday. If by that time
Franklin has not requested a hearing
before the faculty Advisory Board,
Lyman is empowered to act on the
case.
Yesterday in court, Franklin, one of
those who was served notice of the
restraining order, obtained Judge
Evans' permission to act as his own
counsel, and endeavored to clarify what
he called the "vague terms of the
TRO."
After the hearing, when asked why
he chose to defend himself, Franklin
answered, "Lawyers represent people.
They do so to keep things in the same
social class. They speak in a language
that only they understand. People
should break through this class
whenever possible."

In the course of his efforts to clarify
the TRO, Franklin acknowledged the
prohibitions against physical acts
against the University, but asked Evans
if he was enjoined from advocating
either strikes or boycotts.
"Is it true that if I urge that people
not conduct normal business," he
asked, "I could go to jail?"
Evans declined to issue an advisory
opinion on a hypothetical set of
circumstances, and suggested to
Franklin that an attorney should be
relied upon for such consultation.
Franklin then cited the fact that he
had been suspended by President
Lyman, but that he still intended to
teach his class later that day. "If I've
been suspended, is my class no longer a
class, and therefore, a mass or a mill-in
which violates the TRO?" he asked.
Judge Evans replied that it was a
"Good question," but again declined to
rule on it, saying that it was something
Franklin would have to decide for
himself.
Kunstler at Noon Rally
At a noon rally after the hearing,
Chicago-7 defense attorney William
Kunstler told a crowd of over 4 00, "an
injunction is simply an attempt to
destroy social movements.
"The purpose of an injunction is to
intimidate," he added. "The wide
judicial hand travels around so men and
women don't know if what they are
>ing will violate it (the injunction.)"
Nobel Laureate, Linus Pauling, was
also critical of Lyman's suspension of
Franklin. Speaking at the faculty senate
meeting, Pauling termed Lyman's

action "an extraordinary and
unprecedented violation of the
principles of academic freedom and
individual rights — a really dangerous
introduction of authoritarianism in the
University."

obtained, the preliminary injunction as
a John Does "only if the people can be
proved to have done something named
as illegal in the TRO between January
11 (the date of the Lodge disruption)
and the date of the issuance of the
TRO."
Enjoined From Aiding
While this interpretation prevents
individuals from being threatened by
John Does if commissions of "illegal"
acts did not occur on or between
January 11 and February 12, Lyman
added that all people are "enjoined"
from aiding any of those names in the
injunction in the performance of any of
the acts prohibited by the TRO.
Lyman also noted that Professor
Bruce Franklin has until February 25
to reply to the charges for which he
was cited last Friday. If by that time
Franklin has not requested a hearing
before the faculty Advisory Board,
Lyman is empowered to act on the
case.
Yesterday in court, Franklin, one of
those who was served notice of the
restraining order, obtained Judge
Evans' permission to act as his own
counsel, and endeavored to clarify what
he called the "vague terms of the
TRO."
After the hearing, when asked why
he chose to defend himself, Franklin
answered, "Lawyers represent people.
They do so to keep things in the same
social class. They speak in a language
that only they understand. People
should break through this class
whenever possible."

In the course of his efforts to clarify
the TRO, Franklin acknowledged the
prohibitions against physical acts
against the University, but asked Evans
if he was enjoined from advocating
either strikes or boycotts.
"Is it true that if I urge that people
not conduct normal business," he
asked, "I could go to jail?"
Evans declined to issue an advisory
opinion on a hypothetical set of
circumstances, and suggested to
Franklin that an attorney should be
relied upon for such consultation.
Franklin then cited the fact that he
had been suspended by President
Lyman, but that he still intended to
teach his class later that day. "If I've
been suspended, is my class no longer a
class, and therefore, a mass or a mill-in
which violates the TRO?" he asked.
Judge Evans replied that it was a
"Good question," but again declined to
rule on it, saying that it was something
Franklin would have to decide for
himself.
Kunstler at Noon Rally
At a noon rally after the hearing,
Chicago-7 defense attorney William
Kunstler told a crowd of over 4 00, "an
injunction is simply an attempt to
destroy social movements.
"The purpose of an injunction is to
intimidate," he added. "The wide
judicial hand travels around so men and
women don't know if what they are
>ing will violate it (the injunction.)"
Nobel Laureate, Linus Pauling, was
also critical of Lyman's suspension of
Franklin. Speaking at the faculty senate
meeting, Pauling termed Lyman's

action "an extraordinary and
unprecedented violation of the
principles of academic freedom and
individual rights — a really dangerous
introduction of authoritarianism in the
University."
Seven defendants, served with a
temporary restraining order (TRO)
which the University obtained last
Friday, were granted a continuance of
their case until March 1 by Superior
Court judge Stanley R. Evans.
Evans also ruled that the seven who
have already been served will be subject
to the TRO at least until the new trial
date.
Attorneys for the University
obtained another TRO yesterday, after
Evans absolved 10 of the 1 7 defendants
from the original order. The 10 had not
been served notice of the document at
least two days prior to the hearing - the
legal time limit for the order to be
considered binding.
Evans was presiding over the first
session of a "show cause" hearing at
the Santa Clara County courthouse in
which Stanford attorneys are seeking to
replace the TRO with a preliminary
injunction that would bar the named
defendants from participating in
actions which the restraining order
forbids. Such an injunction would also
enjoin non-students named in the TRO
from being present on the Stanford
campus.
At the Faculty Senate meeting
yesterday, President Lyman charged
some elements within the University
with exerting "very energetic efforts to
confuse the issue "of the injunction,
and maintained that there are wide
"misconceptions" of the John Does
mentioned in the TRO.
Lyman explained that defendants
would be added to the TRO or, if

obtained, the preliminary injunction as
a John Does "only if the people can be
proved to have done something named
as illegal in the TRO between January
11 (the date of the Lodge disruption)
and the date of the issuance of the
TRO."
