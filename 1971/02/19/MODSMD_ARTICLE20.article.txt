As Stanford's gymnastics team
heads into the final weeks of their
season, they face their toughest
meets of the year, against UCLA,
Cal, and (JSC. Hut although they
will probably lose these meets,
Coach Dan Millman still views his
team's performance as being
beyond expectation this year.
Millman points out, "We're
young and we've got a lot of
freshmen. Right now we're
working on the fundamentals and
we look for progress to occur in
the future when we realize our
potential. But we've begun to
mature already because the
freshmen coming here already

possess a good deal of experience
and lot of talent.
"Stanford's reputation in
gymnastics has grown immensely
in the past few years. I feel that
program is really beginning to
generate some excitement."
Millman's program basically
emphasizes giving the individual
gymnasts free rein in working on
their routines. The atmosphere in
practice is very informal and what
Millman thinks are superficial
symbols of respect, such as calling
the coach "sir," are totally absent.
In the same sense, Millman refuses
to treat his players as objects to
be manipulated.
Millman sees that there is a
metamorphosis of the sport in the
meets, also. He encourages his
team to learn from their tougher
opponents in order to improve
their own performances. The
emphasis for each gymnast is on
perfection of his specialities.
The team aspect of gymnastics
is not totally removed from the
picture, however. In practice, the
members constantly work with
each other on their routines, and
in the meets, after each individual
finishes his routine, the team
walks out as a whole,
congratulates him, and escorts
him back to the bench.
The whole aura of the meet is
an experience in itself for the
novice spectator. The Old Pavilon
is transformed into a setting more

properly labelled an opera house
than an athletie hall. From the
moment one walks in until the
last event, the impression of a
theatrical performance is
consciously conveyed.
The program explains each
event in detail, and states some
of the basic objectives in
gymnastics. The idea of
competition is de-emphasi/.ed and
is replaced by the drive for
individual perfection. The
audience is an entirely different
type than at most other sporting
events, resembling the spectators
at a figure skating meet.
The atmosphere is evolving
toward the state which Millman
thinks is more proper to
gymnastics. He sees it as an art,
rather than strictly a sport or a
performance. The danger physical
endurance, and skill of sport are
present but the added dimension
of individual expression is more
high-lighted. Gymnastics
illustrates the individual mood of
each gymnast, whether it be
aggressive and daring, or intricate
and precise.
In conjunction with his view of
the evolution of gymnastics from
a sport to a performing art, Coach
Millman has tentatively scheduled
a number of performances for next
year in Maples. The show would
be an intermingling of acrobatics,
gymnastics, and light shows in an
effort to attain total visual effect.

rather than strictly a sport or a
performance. The danger physical
endurance, and skill of sport are
present but the added dimension
of individual expression is more
high-lighted. Gymnastics
illustrates the individual mood of
each gymnast, whether it be
aggressive and daring, or intricate
and precise.
In conjunction with his view of
the evolution of gymnastics from
a sport to a performing art, Coach
Millman has tentatively scheduled
a number of performances for next
year in Maples. The show would
be an intermingling of acrobatics,
gymnastics, and light shows in an
effort to attain total visual effect.


UP, UP, ANI) AWAY—A Stanford gymnast says "Look Mom, no
hands!" Coach Dan Millman's gymnastics team travels to Berkeley
tonight to meet Cal.
As Stanford's gymnastics team
heads into the final weeks of their
season, they face their toughest
meets of the year, against UCLA,
Cal, and (JSC. Hut although they
will probably lose these meets,
Coach Dan Millman still views his
team's performance as being
beyond expectation this year.
Millman points out, "We're
young and we've got a lot of
freshmen. Right now we're
working on the fundamentals and
we look for progress to occur in
the future when we realize our
potential. But we've begun to
mature already because the
freshmen coming here already

possess a good deal of experience
and lot of talent.
"Stanford's reputation in
gymnastics has grown immensely
in the past few years. I feel that
program is really beginning to
generate some excitement."
Millman's program basically
emphasizes giving the individual
gymnasts free rein in working on
their routines. The atmosphere in
practice is very informal and what
Millman thinks are superficial
symbols of respect, such as calling
the coach "sir," are totally absent.
In the same sense, Millman refuses
to treat his players as objects to
be manipulated.
Millman sees that there is a
metamorphosis of the sport in the
meets, also. He encourages his
team to learn from their tougher
opponents in order to improve
their own performances. The
emphasis for each gymnast is on
perfection of his specialities.
The team aspect of gymnastics
is not totally removed from the
picture, however. In practice, the
members constantly work with
each other on their routines, and
in the meets, after each individual
finishes his routine, the team
walks out as a whole,
congratulates him, and escorts
him back to the bench.
The whole aura of the meet is
an experience in itself for the
novice spectator. The Old Pavilon
is transformed into a setting more

properly labelled an opera house
than an athletie hall. From the
moment one walks in until the
last event, the impression of a
theatrical performance is
consciously conveyed.
The program explains each
event in detail, and states some
of the basic objectives in
gymnastics. The idea of
competition is de-emphasi/.ed and
is replaced by the drive for
individual perfection. The
audience is an entirely different
type than at most other sporting
events, resembling the spectators
at a figure skating meet.
The atmosphere is evolving
toward the state which Millman
thinks is more proper to
gymnastics. He sees it as an art,
rather than strictly a sport or a
performance. The danger physical
endurance, and skill of sport are
present but the added dimension
of individual expression is more
high-lighted. Gymnastics
