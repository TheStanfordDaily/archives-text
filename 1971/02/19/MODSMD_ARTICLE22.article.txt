Stanford's baseball team tries
to better their 5-2 -1 season record
when they face Cal Poly
(Pomona) three times this
weekend. The two teams meet
today at 2:00 p.m. in the Sunken
Diamond, and then return there
for a doubleheader starting at
Noon tomorrow.
Stanford's last action was
Tuesday when they lost to Santa
Clara, 2-1. Joe Pupo and Rich
Troedson combined for a two
hitter against the Indians. Dan
Shaw went the distance for
Stanford and gave up the two runs
and eight hits, for his first loss of
the year.
Last Saturday, Stanford beat
and tied the University of San
Francisco in a doubleheader. In
the opener, Bob Kammeyer threw
a four-hit shutout and outfielder
Rod Boon? provided the scoring
punch with two doubles and two
RBl's.
The second game was called
due to darkness after nine innings,
with the score tied 9 -9. Boone had
two hits, three runs and one RBI
to once again pace the Indian
offense. Co-captain Bob Marshall
had three hits and three RBl's and
Tom Chagnon added a double and
a triple.
