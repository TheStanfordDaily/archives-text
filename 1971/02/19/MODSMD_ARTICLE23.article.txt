Hoping to recapture the
momentum that carried them to
four early season wins, Stanford's
varsity rugby team tangles with
the unbeaten UCLA Bruins this
Saturday afternoon on Harry
Maloney Soccer Field.
The Indians, who have dropped
two games since their big win over
the BATS three weeks ago, have
not been sharp in either scrum or
backfield play and have lacked the
timing and consistency necessary
for winning rugby.
The Tribe could only manage
eight points in last Saturday's
match with a vastly improved
Peninsula Ramblers team. Jack
Schultz scored the only try, and
Stewart Wilson added the
conversion and a penalty kick.
The Ramblers, a big, physical
team, shut off the running of Don
Bunce and wingers Eric Cross and
Reggie Sanderson while
converting five penalty kicks and
a try into 18 points.
The Indians are hoping to put
one together this weekend in
preparation for the upcoming
home and home series with the
Cal Bears for the Big Scrum Axe.
UCLA already counts a victory
over Berkeley in their won-loss
record.
