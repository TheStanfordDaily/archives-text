# Center Court Tomorrow
## Tanner Faces Smith 
### HALL DAILY 
The featured match of
tomorrow's Stanford Tennis
Classic will pit Stanford's top
netman, sophomore Roscoe
Tanner, in an exhibition
two-out-of-three set match with
one of the world's top pros and
former U.S. Davis Cupper, Stan
Smith. The action begins at 2:00
p.m. tomorrow at the Stanford
Tennis Stadium.
The festivities will serve the
dual purpose of kicking off the
1971 tennis season with doubles
matches starring the Indians' top
varsity competitors, and the
classic will raise money for the
Buck Club Tennis Scholarship
Fund.
In the opening match, sophs
Gerry Groslimond and Rick
Fisher will meet junior Rick Evans
and frosh Paul Sidone at 2:00

p.m. The Tanner-Smith contest
will follow after one set of
doubles. Following the heralded
singles event will be another
doubled exhibition between
Tanner and Stanford's top junior
amateur Alex Mayer against Smith
and an unannounced partner.
Currently stationed at Ft. Ord,
Stan Smith enjoys the title of
"one of the world's great young
pros." Smith was the nation's
premier amateur player of 1969
and second-ranked in 1970 before
turning pro.
But Smith has not been alone

in collecting championships in
tennis lately. Stanford's Roseoe
Tanner captured the first national
amateur title in January by
championing the 1971 U.S. Men's
Amateur Indoor title.
Both Smith and Tanner are
noted for their strength in serving
and volleying. Each player owns
power in ground strokes and
finesse in placing their shots.
Tickets are available at the
Dept. of Athletics: $3 for all
reserved seats, $2 for non-reserved
