### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After a strong start the
Stanford Club Hockey Team fell
apart and lost to the Belmont
Seniors 11-7.
This means that the Indians
must win the next game with
Belmont by five goals to go into
the finals. In this semi-final series
the winner is determined by the
total amount of goals over the
two games. Stanford obviously
has their work cut out for them.
The Indians started strongly,
passing, skating, and fore-checking
well. On the first shift the "Ivy
Line" of Eddie Leonard, Russ
Macausland, and John Mackall
scored twice. Unfortunately, the
hosts tallied fifteen seconds later.
But the Cards continued to
play solid hockey. They were
playing excellent position in their
opponent's end of the rink, while
in their own end they were
breaking the puck out with good
passing and finesse. The "Ivy
Line" potted another goal to
offset the second Belmont score.
Frosh Rich Jaros closed out the
scoring for the first half of the
game.
Belmont came out fired up for
the last thirty minutes and within
three minutes they tied the score
at 4-4, capitalizing on the Cards'
inability to break the puck out of
their own end.

Stanford was not to be denied
at this point, however. They
gained the lead three more times,
5-4, 6-5, and 7-6. Then the
trouble started. Belmont scored
five straight goals as Stanford
seemed unorganized. Instead of
sticking with their usual lines,
they changed around the
combinations. They didn't know
what to do in their own zone.
The team plays Belmont next

Tuesday at 9 o'clock at Belmont.
Following the playoffs the
team will travel to Boulder,
Colorado for the second annual
Colorado Invitational Hockey
Tournament. It takes place March
4,5, and 6. The other participants
include Wisconsin State College,
lowa State College, and host team
University of Colorado, Boulder.
The latter two teams are club
teams like Stanford.
