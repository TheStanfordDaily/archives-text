Chinese Threaten Retaliation
PARIS — North Vietnam charged yesterday that the United
States had invaded Laos and was threatening to invade
North Vietnamese territory. It raised the possibility of Red
Chinese retaliation.
"The Peoples Republic of China will not stand by idly
while its neighbors are attacked by the United States," said
Nguyen Thanh Le, spokesman for the North Vietnamese
delegation to the Paris peace talks.
Earlier, Xuan Thuy, head of the delegation, said that the
"present large-scale operation" by the United States in
Laos, the concentration of U.S. troops at the 1 7 th Parallel
and the increasing number of warships off North Vietnam
"constitute a menace" to North Vietnam and China.
The spokesman, exanding on Thuy's remarks in answer
to a newsman's question, said a "grave menace" to China
exists because of common frontiers with Laos and North
Vietnam, the fact that the two countries have Communist
regimes and because China signed the 1962 Geneva
agreements on Laos.
President Nixon said at a news conference Wednesday
that the Chinese have no reason to interpret the South
Vietnamese drive into Laos as a threat to their security.
Private Health Plan Proposed
WASHINGTON — President Nixon, rejecting calls for
nationalized health care, asked Congress yesterday to
require that virtually all businesses provide comprehensive
federally prescribed private health insurance for employes
and their families.
The employer requirement was the centerpiece of the
President's $2.95 billion six point health care proposal.
He called for a National Health Insurance Partnership to
correct inadequacies in the network of care, "not by
destroying our present insurance system buy by improving
it."
Under the proposed employer requirements, businesses
with more than one employee would have to offer
comprehensive family health insurance covering
hospitalization, surgical and physicians fees, maternity,
well-baby, family planning, and catastrophic illness
expenses up to $50,000 a year for workers earning more
than $5 ,000 a year.
Employers would pay 65 percent of the estimated
average $300 annual premium for the federally required
package for the first 2 1/2 years after a planned beginning
July 1, 1973 and 75 percent thereafter. There would be
deductible and co-insurance features to discourage overuse
of health services.
Exempted from the requirement would be state and
local governments, and self employed, and organizations or
persons employing domestics or seasonal, part-time
workers.

Bombing Criticized
WASHINGTON - Sen. George S. McGovern, D-S.D.
yesterday called President Nixon's use of airpower over
Laos and Cambodia "barbarian" and said by encouraging
fighting so close to Red China Nixon is risking World War
111.
"President Nixon's statement Wednesday that he would
put no iimit on the use of American airpower in Indochina
is a major escalation of the war," McGovern said.
"And we seem to be getting ready for an invasion of
North Vietnam with full American support," he told a
news conference.
McGovern said the "administration is guilty of running
out on promises it made to the American people two years
ago, to get out of Vietnam."
Berkeley Police Aquitted
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal jury acquitted two deputy
sheriffs yesterday on charges of violating the civil rights of
two men hit by shotgun blasts which killed one and blinded
the other during "People's Park" rioting in Berkeley in May
1969.
The seven men and five women deliberated 111/2 hours
before returning a verdict for Alameda County Deputy
Sheriff Leonard N. Johnson, 47, and former Deputy
Lawrence L. Riche, 25 , now a truck driver.
Johnson was accused of firing buckshot at the rooftop
and fatally wounding James Rector, 25 , of San Jose.
Riche was accused of firing a buckshot blast which
blinded Allan Blanchard, 30, of Berkeley as he stood on an
adjacent roof above Telegraph Avenue.
Egypt Proposes Treaty
JERUSALEUM — Egypt has indicated it will sign a peace
treaty with Israel if Israel withdraws its forces from all of
the Sinai Desert, sources close to the Israeli government
said yesterday.
They said that although Israel would not agree to total
withdrawal, the government of Premier Golda Meir would
urge direct talks with Cairo in an effort to solve the key
issue of an Israeli pullback.
Cairo's willingness to sign a peace agreement reportedly
was delivered Wednesday to Israel's representative at
United Nations headquarters in New York, where U.N.
special envoy Gunnar V. Jarring is conducting peace talks.
It was discussed at an Israeli Cabinet meeting in Jerusalem
on Thursday, the sources said.
In Cairo, no mention was made of such an offer.
Instead, a Foreign Ministry official accused Israel of
following a "policy of expansion despite a show of seeking
peace."
