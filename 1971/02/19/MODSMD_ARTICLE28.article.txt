Anti-War Motion Postponed
The Faculty Senate yesterday postponed until its next
regular meeting (March 4) consideration of a motion
condemning the war in Southeast Asia and the invasion of
Loas.
The motion, introduced by Associate professor of
English Ronald Rebholz, reads (as amended):

government's determination to end rather than extend the
war in Southeast Asia.
"That despair jeopardized the climate of rationality
necessary to the University's functioning. It also inspiies
violence on campus and weakens our ability to cope with
that violence.
"Therefore, we, the Senate of the Academic Council of
Stanford University again condemn the war in Southeast
Asia and its recent extensions as acts having profoundly
damaging effects on the lives of our students and on the life
and work of this University."

Anti-War Motion Postponed
The Faculty Senate yesterday postponed until its next
regular meeting (March 4) consideration of a motion
condemning the war in Southeast Asia and the invasion of
Loas.
The motion, introduced by Associate professor of
English Ronald Rebholz, reads (as amended):
"Like last year's entrance into Cambodia, the incursioi.
into Laos, and the intensification of the air war are
breeding despair, in our students and ourselves, of our
government's determination to end rather than extend the
war in Southeast Asia.
"That despair jeopardized the climate of rationality
necessary to the University's functioning. It also inspiies
violence on campus and weakens our ability to cope with
that violence.
"Therefore, we, the Senate of the Academic Council of
Stanford University again condemn the war in Southeast
Asia and its recent extensions as acts having profoundly
damaging effects on the lives of our students and on the life
and work of this University."
Senate members indicated that this motion may be
reworded or other one's may be introduced by the next
meeting.
