# Council Reportedly Recommends Suspension Of Lodge Disruptors
## 
### JON DEDMON 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has recommended the suspension of
the seven Lodge defendants from one
to four quarters, The Palo Alto Times
reported yesterday.
When asked about the reported
recommendations last night, SJC
Chairman Howard Williams said, "I
neither confirm it nor deny it."
The seven students reportedly
recommended to be suspended had
been before the SJC since January 2 8
on charges that they disrupted
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech here on January 11.
Although the Times report stated
the SJC had imposed the suspensions, it
is President Lyman who would make
the suspensions based on
recommendations from the SJC.
The Council had been deliberating
on the penalties to be recommended
since Tuesday and at the time of the
Times report had still announced no
decision.
How Did It Happen?
When asked of how the Times
learned of the suspensions Williams had
said, "It was not from me."
The article, printed in yesterday's
late edition, stated, "The Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) has found seven
students guilty of violating the campus
disruption policy and imposed
suspension ranging from one to fou*
quarters."
The article added that the decision
was to be published today with
dissenting opinions.
The reported recommended
suspensions ranging from one to four
quarters are similar to the penalties
Assistant to the Provost John Schwartz
had recommended on Tuesday to the
SJC in his concluding remarks
concerning the case.
Schwartz, at that time,
recommended: four quarters
suspension with two quarters stayed for
defendants Brad Dowden, (Jerry Foote,
Merle Rabine, and Theresa Ramirez;
four quarter suspensions with one
quarter stayed for defendants Michael

Holman and Jeff Youdelman; and four
quarters suspension with no quarters
stayed for defendant Janet Weiss.
The seven had walked out of the
February 9 hearing of the case not
contesting the charges against them.
The defendants at that time had
called the trial "farcical" and said that
there were far more important issues to
focus on such as Laos and the BSU
demands.
Defendant Janet Weiss yesterday
charged that her heavier penalty was
due to two convictions in civil courts

and the use of those convictions to
impose a heavier penalty on her before
the SJC constituted double jeopardy.
Last night the Council met to hear
the case of the eighth Lodge defendant,
Skip Slade, who had requested that his
case be heard separately.
The defendants were unavailable for
comment on the reported suspensions
last night.
Tuesday the Council meets to hear
Lodge defendant Michael Holman and
Gary Vaneuer alleged window-breaking
in November.

quarters."
The article added that the decision
was to be published today with
dissenting opinions.
The reported recommended
suspensions ranging from one to four
quarters are similar to the penalties
Assistant to the Provost John Schwartz
had recommended on Tuesday to the
SJC in his concluding remarks
concerning the case.
Schwartz, at that time,
recommended: four quarters
suspension with two quarters stayed for
defendants Brad Dowden, (Jerry Foote,
Merle Rabine, and Theresa Ramirez;
four quarter suspensions with one
quarter stayed for defendants Michael

Holman and Jeff Youdelman; and four
quarters suspension with no quarters
stayed for defendant Janet Weiss.
The seven had walked out of the
February 9 hearing of the case not
contesting the charges against them.
The defendants at that time had
called the trial "farcical" and said that
there were far more important issues to
focus on such as Laos and the BSU
demands.
Defendant Janet Weiss yesterday
charged that her heavier penalty was
due to two convictions in civil courts

and the use of those convictions to
impose a heavier penalty on her before
the SJC constituted double jeopardy.
Last night the Council met to hear
the case of the eighth Lodge defendant,
Skip Slade, who had requested that his
case be heard separately.
The defendants were unavailable for
comment on the reported suspensions
last night.
Tuesday the Council meets to hear
Lodge defendant Michael Holman and
Gary Vaneuer alleged window-breaking
in November.
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has recommended the suspension of
the seven Lodge defendants from one
to four quarters, The Palo Alto Times
reported yesterday.
When asked about the reported
recommendations last night, SJC
Chairman Howard Williams said, "I
neither confirm it nor deny it."
The seven students reportedly
recommended to be suspended had
been before the SJC since January 2 8
on charges that they disrupted
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech here on January 11.
Although the Times report stated
the SJC had imposed the suspensions, it
is President Lyman who would make
the suspensions based on
recommendations from the SJC.
The Council had been deliberating
on the penalties to be recommended
since Tuesday and at the time of the
Times report had still announced no
decision.
How Did It Happen?
When asked of how the Times
learned of the suspensions Williams had
said, "It was not from me."
The article, printed in yesterday's
late edition, stated, "The Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) has found seven
students guilty of violating the campus
disruption policy and imposed
suspension ranging from one to fou*
quarters."
The article added that the decision
was to be published today with
dissenting opinions.
