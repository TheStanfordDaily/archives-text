"It is time now for the faculty to
take the initiative," said Charles
Drekmeier, professor of Political
Science last night when opening a
meeting sponsored by the new Faculty
Political Action Group.
"We know the University is not
neutral.. . that it often acts as a
branch of government," he continued
adding that "the University cannot
survive in a society where priorities are
so misplaced."
At the close of the formal meeting,
when a discussion group was beginning,
Pierre Noyes, professor at the Stanford
Linear Accelerator, charged that the
University had deliberately concealed
the existence of a CIA-funded contract
with a member of the faculty (later
identified as William Rambo, director
of Stanford Electronics Laboratories)
until 1 969 .
"The fact that this University held
this contract was known to only two or
three people in the University
administration.
"It was concealed in the University
budget.
"The fact became known to me as

past history in the context of a
classified discussion I had when we
started monitoring classified contracts.
"The existence of the concealment
of this contract was declassified, and I
know want to make that a matter of
public record."
Noyes also charged that all faculty
members were required to have security
clearance to operate a school in Peru a
project run by the Business School
here.
The announced purpose of the
meeting, held in the Physics lecture hall
and broadcast over KZSU, was to
stimulate open discussion of topics
centering on Stanford University's
involvement with the government and
on the administration's reaction to
campus disorders.
Speakers included professor
Drekmeier, Halsted Holman, professor
of medicine center, and Raymond
Giraud, professor of French.
The audience was composed of over
250 members of the community
ranging from Dean Napier and his wife
to members of the Inquisition and
Venceremos.
Holman directed his remarks to the
University's involvement with the
government and in particular the
military. Relating his remarks to the
results of the Nuremberg and Tokyo
War Crime tribunals, Holman referred
to several statistical tables which, he
said, pointed out the increasing
dependence of the University on
government funds.
Citing four categories he showed
how Stanford is directly or indirectly
supporting military industries. Noting
that since World War II the military has
had increasing control over the
country's educational institutions
Holman said that we have become
dependent on government money
through research and defense contracts.
Thus in a crucial time in the
formation of the University, the
military has had a strong influence in
shaping our development, he
concluded.
