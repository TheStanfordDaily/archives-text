# little dick's witch hunt
## Community Resistance

"A university is not a democratically organized
institution, and cannot become one without
destroying it." Richard Lyman, March 30,1 970.
Communities are going to have to get together to
understand the criminality of American involvement
in Indochina, and to refuse to contribute any more
brainpower, money or manpower to its
genocial/imperialist ends. We must resist as a
community.
Individual or even collective expressions that do
not apply tangible pressure on Nixon, the Pentagon,
and our ruling class, at this point in history is
moral masturbation. There has been more than
enough moral outrage during the last six years. And
in the last six years millions of people in Laos,
Vietnam, and more recently in Cambodia, have
continually been bombed and napalmed. Every day
that the Little Dick deplores and enjoins disruption,
thousands of pounds are dropped in Indochina. And
the Year of the Mushroom grows imminent.
Research Investigation
The Stanford War Crimes Commission, now
called the Inquisition, was set up by faculty,
students, and alumni to start a University-wide
investigation of research and consulting which serves
genocidal/imperialist ends of U.S. foreign policy.
Stanford—far from even imitating an ivory tower,
is a service organization for the U.S. government
and the military-industrial complex. Broken
windows are not the real threat to this "community

of technical scholars." The real threat comes when
people begin to understand what ends the
University is serving, when we begin to demand that
faculty and students have control over the research
permitted and the allocation of funds.
Student Needs
Such a form of democracy could well destroy
Stanford as number four on DoD's funding list. But
it could mean that Stanford might become a place
that fulfills student needs instead of the
government's, a place that funds free inquiry instead
of only paying it lip service.
If advocating Stanford be democratically
organized, and that as a community we resist the
war—if this means destroying it as it stands, then I
am advocating that destruction. My major
"disruptive" activities have been to do research, give
speeches, write articles about Stanford and
imperialism. This is clearly a threat to the kind of
academic freedom that Lyman is fighting to
preserve—freedom to serve the machine.
The TRO which will ban me from speaking and
doing research on campus states that my crime was
that I was standing (not kicking, pushing, but
standing) in the downstairs lobby of the Business
School BEFORE the police came, BEFORE people
were told to leave. I do not have the right to a jury
trial. The Inquisition could never compete with the
witch hunt that Little Dick is running.
