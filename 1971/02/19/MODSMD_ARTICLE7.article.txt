### 
The recent invasion of Laos
showed once more that the
leaders of our country will not
themselves stop this immoral war.
Nor do they seem persuaded by
public opinion expressed through
ordinary channels. The recent
invasion escalates the demand for
our response as Christians,
particularly since further
extensions of the invasion seem
imminent. Washington clearly
seeks a military solution to this
war.
Our country has been spending
two billion dollars a year to
pursue the war in Laos before
these new moves, and our
bombing there over the last two
years has been some of the
heaviest in history. Large sections
of the country lie in complete
devastation. By contrast, this
budget for war in Laos might have
been used to advance the cause of
life. It was our tax money; we are
being forced to continue paying
for destruction. By our silence, by
our money and by our research
we are perpetuating this war â€”
whether it be by troops or by the
horrors of bombing.
The Second Vatican Council
has given us the principles for
judging this situation. It says:
"Man's conscience itself gives ever
more emphatic voice to these
principles (against war).
Therefore, actions which
deliberately conflict with these
same principles, as well as orders
commanding such actions, are
criminal. Blind obedience cannot
excuse those who yield to them.
Among such must first be counted
those actions designed for the
methodical extermination of an
entire people, nation or ethnic
minority. These actions must be

vehemently condemned as
horrendous crimes. The courage
of those who openly and
fearlessly resist men who issue
such commands merits supreme
commendation." It later adds:
"Any act of war aimed
indiscriminately at the destruction
of entire cities or of extensive
areas along with their population
is a crime against God and man
himself. It merits unequivocal and
unhesitating condemnation."
In this context, we wish to
speak to you, President Lyman.
You have indeed condemned the
war. But Stanford has a role in
this war, and that role you have
not condemned or abjured. You
have offered no leadership in
bringing the forces of Stanford
and similar institutions to bear
against industrial support of the
war. How can you command our
respect in any context until your
words and actions come together
on this over-riding issue: the war?
If truth is the aim of learning, let
this institution of learning be
converted to the clear, practical
conscience that this immoral war
must be stopped.
Violence is abhorrent on the
campus. It is equally so in
Southeast Asia. Constructive
tactics of action that force this
country to stop the war are our
only recourse in the face of the
intransigency of our leadership.
This is a Christian plea, in a
predominantly Christian
community. If we only speak and
do not act, we are hypocrites. We
say "our Father" in prayer; we
cannot falsify our prayer by
allowing our talent and money to
destroy our brothers and sisters in
Southeast Asia.
Moral outrage is a luxury- we

cannot afford. We as Christians
must mobilize and show strength
in the face of the threat of
escalated killing.
