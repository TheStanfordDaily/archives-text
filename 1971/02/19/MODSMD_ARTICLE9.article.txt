# absence of dialogue
## Support For Nixon's Actions 
### 
It is disturbing that at Stanford
the diverse but liberty loving
majority has suffered from
violence and arrogant disruption
and denial of personal and
academic rights perpetrated by a
self appointed revolutionary elite.
It is disturbing that the obscene
and psychopathic renderings of
certain radical leaders come from
minds so accustomed to
doublethink that they can
interpret a call for "peace force
mobilization" from Madame Binh
of the North Vietnamese elite as
an "appeal from the peasants."
More disturbing, though, is
something far less tangible, since
it is not dialogue or action, but its
absence. This is the absence of
any internally generated argument
or political effort in support of
U.S. action in Southeast Asia.
In a healthy academic
community even the views of the
smallest minorities can be heard,
but in the atmosphere of radical
repression which exists here, we
no longer have dialogue or debate
on this issue. We have a
monologue from which the last of
the peace oriented liberals are
now being purged. I have been on
the college scene for eight years,
and I can remember when the
SDS contained more liberals than
Maoists and teach-ins actually
presented both sides of the
Vietnam issue. I also recall that
these teach-ins never produced
unanimity on the Vietnam
question.
The effect of agitation, as
teach-ins turned into protest

meetings and protests assumed a
more destructive character, was
mainly on the freshmen; for they,
along with high-school students,
are at their most peer sensitive
age. The monologue of the left,
coupled with an atmosphere of
intimidation, has now produced a
situation in which the more
conforming freshman has only
two socially acceptable
alternatives regarding this issue.
That is, he sees all those around
him following one of two courses,
either shutting their mouths, or
picking up bricks.
The campus has really become
a large scale exercise in
participatory democracy, a
process which Denis Hayes
described aptly as "bullshit. ' #
Those who initially go along with
the group, but later can't agree
with a radical course of action
aren't willing to be bound by the
decision of the group. They are
therefore not allowed to vote.
They drop out and thus speed up
the process of ideological
self-purification. The price of
being a radical, active or passive,
has gone up.
For those stragglers who cop
out by acting as apologists for
radical atrocities the destiny is
clear, for they are promoting their
own enslavement. The remaining
liberals and conservatives, though,
may be able to change the
situation, both by refusing to
become input for this process and
by filling the existing ideological
vacuum with some less popular
views.

I am therefore expressing my
support for President Nixon's
recent actions in Southeast Asia,
including American support for
the Laos action. My objection to
the Vietnamese situation is not to
U.S. involvement, but to the way
in which it was initially handled.
At last Mr. Nixon is beginning to
bring some skill to the job, and he
is reducing the cost in terms of
American lives. This is my
opinion, and I am exercising my
right to express it now because
that right seems in danger of
becoming merely theoretical
unless it is strongly asserted.

participatory democracy, a
process which Denis Hayes
described aptly as "bullshit. ' #
Those who initially go along with
the group, but later can't agree
with a radical course of action
aren't willing to be bound by the
decision of the group. They are
therefore not allowed to vote.
They drop out and thus speed up
the process of ideological
self-purification. The price of
being a radical, active or passive,
has gone up.
For those stragglers who cop
out by acting as apologists for
radical atrocities the destiny is
clear, for they are promoting their
own enslavement. The remaining
liberals and conservatives, though,
may be able to change the
situation, both by refusing to
become input for this process and
by filling the existing ideological
vacuum with some less popular
views.

I am therefore expressing my
support for President Nixon's
recent actions in Southeast Asia,
including American support for
the Laos action. My objection to
the Vietnamese situation is not to
U.S. involvement, but to the way
in which it was initially handled.
At last Mr. Nixon is beginning to
bring some skill to the job, and he
is reducing the cost in terms of
American lives. This is my
opinion, and I am exercising my
right to express it now because
that right seems in danger of
becoming merely theoretical
unless it is strongly asserted.

graduate student.)
It is disturbing that at Stanford
the diverse but liberty loving
majority has suffered from
violence and arrogant disruption
and denial of personal and
academic rights perpetrated by a
self appointed revolutionary elite.
It is disturbing that the obscene
and psychopathic renderings of
certain radical leaders come from
minds so accustomed to
doublethink that they can
interpret a call for "peace force
mobilization" from Madame Binh
of the North Vietnamese elite as
an "appeal from the peasants."
More disturbing, though, is
something far less tangible, since
it is not dialogue or action, but its
absence. This is the absence of
any internally generated argument
or political effort in support of
U.S. action in Southeast Asia.
In a healthy academic
community even the views of the
smallest minorities can be heard,
but in the atmosphere of radical
repression which exists here, we
no longer have dialogue or debate
on this issue. We have a
monologue from which the last of
the peace oriented liberals are
now being purged. I have been on
the college scene for eight years,
and I can remember when the
SDS contained more liberals than
Maoists and teach-ins actually
presented both sides of the
Vietnam issue. I also recall that
these teach-ins never produced
unanimity on the Vietnam
question.
The effect of agitation, as
teach-ins turned into protest

meetings and protests assumed a
more destructive character, was
mainly on the freshmen; for they,
along with high-school students,
are at their most peer sensitive
age. The monologue of the left,
coupled with an atmosphere of
intimidation, has now produced a
situation in which the more
conforming freshman has only
two socially acceptable
alternatives regarding this issue.
That is, he sees all those around
him following one of two courses,
either shutting their mouths, or
picking up bricks.
The campus has really become
a large scale exercise in
participatory democracy, a
process which Denis Hayes
described aptly as "bullshit. ' #
