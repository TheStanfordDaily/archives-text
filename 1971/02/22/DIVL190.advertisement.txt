May the
fox and coyote
live happily
ever after.
Fox: girl. Coyote: hoy.
They meet, they mate, and
suddenly responsibility
becomes a much more
important word. So it's a
good thing to plan nowâ€”
before foxy and family
make the scene.
One way is by investing
in a life insurance program
that can provide the
foundation for a solid
financial structure. The
earlier you start, the less the
coverage costs. And the
more security you'll have
a chance to build.
Phone our office today.
Or stop by. We can't
promise happiness and bliss
ever after, but we can help
keep the wolf from the door.
