# Senate Oblivious To Student Plea
## 
### PETER KNUTSON Commentary 
Editor's note: (I'eter Knutson is a freshman, and
chairman of the Stanford Draft Repeal Movement.
Two weeks ago he went to Washington to testify
before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
speaking against the extension of the current selective
service law, which expires June 30. He was the only
draft-age person to address the committee.)
Washington smacked of arrogance. Pervading
virtually every cubbyhold in the bureaucracy of
Congress was the unmistakable atmosphere of
haughtiness; a haughtiness bred by security of
position and power.
As I waited to speak before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, an old man—he must have been
near 70, strutted up the center aisle of the chamber,
passed in front of the witness testifying, loudly
assumed his elevated, gallery-facing seat, and in the
process thoroughly disrupted the hearings.
He was a Senator.
Since I was the next witness, the page quickly
delivered my transcript to him. In glancing over my
statement John Stennis' facial expression began to
shift. The old warhawk from Mississippi soon struck a
characteristic, recognizable pose, he was angry.
Five minutes later, I said, "This talk (of war)
would cease rather quickly if men like the President
and Senators were drafted, given an M-l 6 and told to
lead the first wave." An aged man whom I mistook
for a staff member got up and left the room, to get a
drink of water, I thought. No big deal.
Six hundred words and six minutes after that, I
discovered that it was indeed a big deal. A Strom
Thurmond walkout, I was told, isn't just a stroll to
the lavatory; it has "deep political significance."
In all due respect to Senator Thurmond, however,
he did later indicate that his exit was not a political
act; he had an important meeting to attend.

According to Thurmond, he left to meet
highly-placed government official to discuss "the
flammability of children's underwear."
A Long Afternoon
The self-righteous arrogance I witnessed on that
February morning confronted me throughout the rest
of the day.
"Your Congressman believes that every young man
should serve his country. That is why he advocates
national service for all young men," explained the
aide of my Washington state congressman.
The incredibly antiseptic way in which a
bureaucrat can say the words "young men" never
ceases to amaze me; they seem to think that 12
million young men, "military manpower" in the
official jargon, are only another resource to be
exploited in the "national interest" in the same
fashion as oil or timber.
I replied to my Congressman's aide, "But national
service completely abrogates the freedom this
country was founded upon."
"Don't you feel you owe this country something
for what it's given you?" he replied.
"The primary obligation I have to this country is
to make it as free as possible," I said. The draft forces
me to either abandon my conscience and fight in that
war, to face prison, or to flee to Canada. What kind
of freedom is that? If America had entered World War
Two on the side of Nazi Germany would you have
allowed hourself to be drafted? Would you have
blindly fought for Hitler or would you have gone to
prison?"
"Well, we didn't know of Hitler's atrocities until
after the Second World War. Who's to say whether or
not I would have gone. I might have—in fact Drobably
would have."
Disturbing The Peace
The conversation was interrupted by an old

gentleman who emerged from my Congressman's
study. He smilingly informed me that the "boss" was
trying to work; I would have to leave. I left.
1 had hoped that Senator Kennedy's office owuld
lend a more leceptive ear to my concerns. I was
wrong. In the course of my conversation with
Kennedy's legislative assistant, he stated that
"everyone has an obligation to fight for his country"
and that my motivations for rejecting that truism
were basically "selfish."
Our conversation had reached an impasse; we were
arguing the draft from totally different
premises—mine, individual freedom—his, national
"defense." My attempts to convey the moral dilemma
in which the draft places people like myself had
failed.
Considerations of conscience carry little weight in
Washington.
Flying out of Washington that evening, I was
frustrated and angry with my inability to change even
a few beauracratic heads. Perhaps my approach was
wrong. Perhaps I should have stressed the more
practical aspects of ending the draft, increased
efficiency and things of that sort. Perhaps not.
Pros And Cons
Reaction to my statement before the Senate had
been diverse but generally favorable. Approval has
come from a farmer in Shelbyville, Indiana whose son
had been ripped off by the draft. He has also heard
from conservative Republicans who claim they'll
never again vote for Nixon, World War One Veterans
who say they'd now resist if drafted, and concerned
housewives from small towns. But the mail hasn't all
been laudatory.
To judge the effects of my work in Washington is
difficult, if nothing else I know that Strom
Thurmond is a socially concerned Senator. We can all
be thankful that the children of America will never
have hot pants.

against their will. And as one student found out, that situation looks like it may
not change.
Editor's note: (I'eter Knutson is a freshman, and
chairman of the Stanford Draft Repeal Movement.
Two weeks ago he went to Washington to testify
before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
speaking against the extension of the current selective
service law, which expires June 30. He was the only
draft-age person to address the committee.)
Washington smacked of arrogance. Pervading
virtually every cubbyhold in the bureaucracy of
Congress was the unmistakable atmosphere of
haughtiness; a haughtiness bred by security of
position and power.
As I waited to speak before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, an old man—he must have been
near 70, strutted up the center aisle of the chamber,
passed in front of the witness testifying, loudly
assumed his elevated, gallery-facing seat, and in the
process thoroughly disrupted the hearings.
He was a Senator.
Since I was the next witness, the page quickly
delivered my transcript to him. In glancing over my
statement John Stennis' facial expression began to
shift. The old warhawk from Mississippi soon struck a
characteristic, recognizable pose, he was angry.
Five minutes later, I said, "This talk (of war)
would cease rather quickly if men like the President
and Senators were drafted, given an M-l 6 and told to
lead the first wave." An aged man whom I mistook
for a staff member got up and left the room, to get a
drink of water, I thought. No big deal.
Six hundred words and six minutes after that, I
discovered that it was indeed a big deal. A Strom
Thurmond walkout, I was told, isn't just a stroll to
the lavatory; it has "deep political significance."
In all due respect to Senator Thurmond, however,
he did later indicate that his exit was not a political
act; he had an important meeting to attend.

According to Thurmond, he left to meet
highly-placed government official to discuss "the
flammability of children's underwear."
A Long Afternoon
The self-righteous arrogance I witnessed on that
February morning confronted me throughout the rest
of the day.
"Your Congressman believes that every young man
should serve his country. That is why he advocates
national service for all young men," explained the
aide of my Washington state congressman.
The incredibly antiseptic way in which a
bureaucrat can say the words "young men" never
ceases to amaze me; they seem to think that 12
million young men, "military manpower" in the
official jargon, are only another resource to be
exploited in the "national interest" in the same
fashion as oil or timber.
I replied to my Congressman's aide, "But national
service completely abrogates the freedom this
country was founded upon."
"Don't you feel you owe this country something
for what it's given you?" he replied.
"The primary obligation I have to this country is
to make it as free as possible," I said. The draft forces
me to either abandon my conscience and fight in that
war, to face prison, or to flee to Canada. What kind
of freedom is that? If America had entered World War
Two on the side of Nazi Germany would you have
allowed hourself to be drafted? Would you have
blindly fought for Hitler or would you have gone to
prison?"
"Well, we didn't know of Hitler's atrocities until
after the Second World War. Who's to say whether or
not I would have gone. I might have—in fact Drobably
would have."
Disturbing The Peace
The conversation was interrupted by an old

gentleman who emerged from my Congressman's
study. He smilingly informed me that the "boss" was
trying to work; I would have to leave. I left.
1 had hoped that Senator Kennedy's office owuld
lend a more leceptive ear to my concerns. I was
wrong. In the course of my conversation with
Kennedy's legislative assistant, he stated that
"everyone has an obligation to fight for his country"
and that my motivations for rejecting that truism
were basically "selfish."
Our conversation had reached an impasse; we were
arguing the draft from totally different
premises—mine, individual freedom—his, national
"defense." My attempts to convey the moral dilemma
in which the draft places people like myself had
failed.
Considerations of conscience carry little weight in
Washington.
Flying out of Washington that evening, I was
frustrated and angry with my inability to change even
a few beauracratic heads. Perhaps my approach was
wrong. Perhaps I should have stressed the more
practical aspects of ending the draft, increased
efficiency and things of that sort. Perhaps not.
Pros And Cons
Reaction to my statement before the Senate had
been diverse but generally favorable. Approval has
come from a farmer in Shelbyville, Indiana whose son
had been ripped off by the draft. He has also heard
from conservative Republicans who claim they'll
never again vote for Nixon, World War One Veterans
who say they'd now resist if drafted, and concerned
housewives from small towns. But the mail hasn't all
been laudatory.
To judge the effects of my work in Washington is
difficult, if nothing else I know that Strom
Thurmond is a socially concerned Senator. We can all
be thankful that the children of America will never
have hot pants.

GUESS WHO —This familiar old man spends most of his time recruiting for the
military. Sometimes his subjects volunteer, but many others are forced to go
against their will. And as one student found out, that situation looks like it may
not change.
Editor's note: (I'eter Knutson is a freshman, and
chairman of the Stanford Draft Repeal Movement.
Two weeks ago he went to Washington to testify
before the Senate Armed Services Committee,
speaking against the extension of the current selective
service law, which expires June 30. He was the only
draft-age person to address the committee.)
Washington smacked of arrogance. Pervading
virtually every cubbyhold in the bureaucracy of
Congress was the unmistakable atmosphere of
haughtiness; a haughtiness bred by security of
position and power.
As I waited to speak before the Senate Armed
Services Committee, an old man—he must have been
near 70, strutted up the center aisle of the chamber,
passed in front of the witness testifying, loudly
assumed his elevated, gallery-facing seat, and in the
process thoroughly disrupted the hearings.
He was a Senator.
Since I was the next witness, the page quickly
delivered my transcript to him. In glancing over my
statement John Stennis' facial expression began to
shift. The old warhawk from Mississippi soon struck a
characteristic, recognizable pose, he was angry.
Five minutes later, I said, "This talk (of war)
would cease rather quickly if men like the President
and Senators were drafted, given an M-l 6 and told to
lead the first wave." An aged man whom I mistook
for a staff member got up and left the room, to get a
drink of water, I thought. No big deal.
Six hundred words and six minutes after that, I
discovered that it was indeed a big deal. A Strom
Thurmond walkout, I was told, isn't just a stroll to
the lavatory; it has "deep political significance."
In all due respect to Senator Thurmond, however,
he did later indicate that his exit was not a political
act; he had an important meeting to attend.

According to Thurmond, he left to meet
highly-placed government official to discuss "the
flammability of children's underwear."
A Long Afternoon
The self-righteous arrogance I witnessed on that
February morning confronted me throughout the rest
of the day.
"Your Congressman believes that every young man
should serve his country. That is why he advocates
national service for all young men," explained the
aide of my Washington state congressman.
The incredibly antiseptic way in which a
bureaucrat can say the words "young men" never
ceases to amaze me; they seem to think that 12
million young men, "military manpower" in the
official jargon, are only another resource to be
exploited in the "national interest" in the same
fashion as oil or timber.
I replied to my Congressman's aide, "But national
service completely abrogates the freedom this
country was founded upon."
"Don't you feel you owe this country something
for what it's given you?" he replied.
"The primary obligation I have to this country is
to make it as free as possible," I said. The draft forces
me to either abandon my conscience and fight in that
war, to face prison, or to flee to Canada. What kind
of freedom is that? If America had entered World War
Two on the side of Nazi Germany would you have
allowed hourself to be drafted? Would you have
blindly fought for Hitler or would you have gone to
prison?"
"Well, we didn't know of Hitler's atrocities until
after the Second World War. Who's to say whether or
not I would have gone. I might have—in fact Drobably
would have."
Disturbing The Peace
The conversation was interrupted by an old

gentleman who emerged from my Congressman's
study. He smilingly informed me that the "boss" was
trying to work; I would have to leave. I left.
1 had hoped that Senator Kennedy's office owuld
lend a more leceptive ear to my concerns. I was
wrong. In the course of my conversation with
Kennedy's legislative assistant, he stated that
"everyone has an obligation to fight for his country"
and that my motivations for rejecting that truism
were basically "selfish."
Our conversation had reached an impasse; we were
arguing the draft from totally different
premises—mine, individual freedom—his, national
"defense." My attempts to convey the moral dilemma
in which the draft places people like myself had
failed.
Considerations of conscience carry little weight in
Washington.
Flying out of Washington that evening, I was
frustrated and angry with my inability to change even
a few beauracratic heads. Perhaps my approach was
wrong. Perhaps I should have stressed the more
practical aspects of ending the draft, increased
efficiency and things of that sort. Perhaps not.
Pros And Cons
Reaction to my statement before the Senate had
been diverse but generally favorable. Approval has
come from a farmer in Shelbyville, Indiana whose son
had been ripped off by the draft. He has also heard
from conservative Republicans who claim they'll
never again vote for Nixon, World War One Veterans
who say they'd now resist if drafted, and concerned
housewives from small towns. But the mail hasn't all
been laudatory.
To judge the effects of my work in Washington is
difficult, if nothing else I know that Strom
Thurmond is a socially concerned Senator. We can all
be thankful that the children of America will never
have hot pants.
