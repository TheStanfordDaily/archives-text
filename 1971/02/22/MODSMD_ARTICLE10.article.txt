## Comments On Land Use Policy 
###

I endorse the Livingston &
Blayney report enthusiastically
and believe that it will provide an
excellent guide to the University
and our neighbors in our joint
efforts toward intelligent and
sensitive planning. The report
recognizes the enormous
complexity of the problem and it
weighs competing uses and the
need for future flexibility in an
effective balance.
It is in welcome and striking
contrast to the earlier (and last)
outside consultant's report, the
1 95 3 Skidmore Owings and
Merrill "Master Plan for Land
Use." • That report had
recommended only 250 0 acres for
academic reserve and would have
covered most of the rest of the
land with a continuation of
suburban sprawl of middle and
upper income homes.
Fortunately, since 1 953 we have
increasingly recognized the greater
significance of the University's
potential academic needs on the
one hand and the importance of
this area as a subregional urban
center on the other hand.
The Livingston and Blayney
study brings us up to date and
helps us focus on both short and
long-term policies and plans.
Although properly sensitive to
community and regional planning
considerations, the report is,
above all, faithful to the fact that
the lands were left in trust for the
benefit of the University. Its
concluding paragraph ways it
well:
"Where Stanford lands are
needed for academic or related
uses that will raise the educational
eminence of the University or will
broaden its contribution to
society, such uses must be given
the highest priority. Where
Stanford lands can be developed
to yield needed income to finance
the University's operations and/or
to meet a pressing social need,
such uses also are appropriate, but
they must take second place to
academic needs. Both
requirements can and must be met
without eroding the natural
beauty of Stanford's setting or
cancelling the unquantifiable but
very contribution it makes to the
University's academic greatness."

As the Vice President for
Finance I should comment on the
financial implications of the
report but I would first commend
the study for recognizing as a
higher priority the land use
potential for direct and indirect
academic purposes. The land
available and used for learning is
an altogether unique Stanford
asset. It has already enabled
remarkable advances in particle
physics (through land for SLAC)
and radio astronomy (lands for
the "antenna farm"), and it has
provided a rare 800 acre preserve
for study of natural life cycles
(.Jasper Ridge). The report's
recommendations concerning
additional lands for academic
reserve, therefore, are most
welcome. So also is the report's
recognition that development of
some of the lands "will increase
interaction between the
University, commerce, and the
professions, which contributes to
Stanford's academic
strength"—and I would add, will
enhance the University's ability to
serve society through speeding the
usefulness of new knowledge.
Positive Contribution
It seems to me that for those
functions which differentiate a
university from a college, the
proximity of knowledge-intense
business and professional
organizations, holds enormous
promise for the future. We should
not be blinded by the tragedy that
our misplaced national priorities
may have perverted much of this
value in recent years in the name
of "national defense." University
lands used for industry and the
professions can make a positive
contribution far beyond the lease
income available to the
educational budgets. I think of
our largest leasehold tenant,
Syntex, as a good current
example.
In addition to the more
significant direct and indirect
academic benefits, there are
indeed important financial
implications of land use and I
believe the Livingston
recommendations put these in fair
perspective. After careful
consideration of a number of
alternatives for those lands judged

logical for development (a minor
portion of the total lands),
Livingston resists the
combinations providing the
highest monetary returns. He does
so because of other planning
considerations. Yet his
recommendations indicate a range
of about $13 million to $2 4
million in new funds from
additional lands which might be
developed.
These dollars, in addition to
the approximately $3 million per
year from land development now
supporting Stanford's budget, are
even more significant than they
might seem. Let me mention two
reasons for this. First, the dollars
are totally unrestricted and thus
applicable to the University's
highest priority needs. Land
development currently provides
almost one-third of such totally
unrestricted endowment and gift
income. Second, Stanford's use of
part of the lands for income (and
to reduce the tax burden on
non-academic lands) is important
evidence to donors that the
University is doing what it
reasonable can to help itself.
Donors May Leave
Gifts and income on past gifts
are the largest source of income,
larger than tuition, to meet
Stanford's educational expenses.
Donors have choices. If we fail to
do a thoughtful responsible job of
developing part of the Stanford
lands for income, I'm sure many
of our donors would chose to
support other institutions, and I
could not fault them.
Leaving financial
considerations now, I would like
to commend the Livingston and
Blayney report also for its
recognition of Stanford lands as
an important feature in the
further development of the
mid-Peninsula as a sub-regional
urban center. The report seems to
be wholly consistent with what
little regional planning has been
accomplished to date, that
sponsored by the Association of
Bay Area Governments.
ABAG's "Regional Plan
1 9 70-1990 " calls for emphasis on
distinct urban centers, apart from
the otherwise impossible urban

concentrations of San Francisco,
Oakland and San Jose. Such
centers of employment
surrounded by residential
communities should develop "in
harmony with open space areas
and nature." Certainly the
recommended policy /plan for
Stanford lands can help make this
one of the most attractive
sub-regional centers in the world,
let alone the Bay Area.
Balanced Development
Even though our particular
center is seriously handicapped by
a governmental jumble—parts of
two counties and at least nine
cities—existing land uses have not
yet wiped out the potential for a
balanced development. Stanford
lands, lying in both counties and
subject to the jurisdictions of five
cities, provide much of the
opportunity to influence such
balanced development. I believe
the Livingston report will help us
make the most of that
opportunity, including important
provisions for open space.
Although the report suggests
opportunities for integrated
low /moderate income housing, its
recommendations represent only a
small contribution toward
meeting this shocking problem
which plagues the nation and
should embarrass most suburban
communities. It implies that
Stanford's contribution should be
more by the quality of solution
than by quantity. This means to
me that we are left with the deep
obligation to encourage all
communities in our subregional
center to attack this need
urgently.
It is clear that low/moderate
income housing must be
integrated into existing as well as
new residential communities. The
report does not tell us how to do
this except by example. But the
recommended potential uses or
non-uses of Stanford lands should
provide us with opportunities to
influence or make more practical
and inclusion of housing for the
poor in our mid-Peninsula area.
