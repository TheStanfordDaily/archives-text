# Tanner Aces Smith
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's sophomore tennis
star Roscoe Tanner powered his
way past a Ft. Ord-stationed Stan
Smith 6-3, 7-5 Saturday at the
Stanford Tennis Classic.
In other exhibition play, the
Tribe tandem of Rick Fisher and
Gerry Groslimond captured a 6-4
win over Rick Evans and Paul
Sidone with a timely love-game
service break against Sidone in the
ninth game of the set.
In the finale, Tanner teamed
with top frosh prospect Alex
Mayer to out-steady Smith and
former Cal great Chuck Darley,
7-5.
Coach Dick Gould's
well-planned Classic was liberated
from its "country club"
atmosphere by the übiquitous and
irrepressible LSJU Band.
The brass and wind boys
offered the crowd their usual
array of colorful cheers including
cries of "Hello exhibitionists,"
"Stop raising a racket," and
"Keep your balls away from our
horns."
But the tennis action stole the
show. In the feature match,
Tanner's speed and power was too
much for his giant opponent. He
never lost his serve and broke
Smith's serve twice to provide the
margin of victory.
Leading 4 -3 in the opening set,
Tanner put away three straight
Smith serves with backhands
down the line. On break point, he
hit a topspin lob over the
mammoth Smith to win the game.
The second set went down to
the wire as the performers traded
serves until Tanner's serve at 4-5.
After eight deuces, four set points
for Smith, and a band reminder
for General Smith to remember

the Little Big Horn, Tanner held
his serve to knot it up at five-all.
After that, there was no
stopping Stanford's number one.
He broke Smith's serve in six
points and won it all on his fourth
match point in the twelfth game
of the final set.
