# Reds Win Pair

### TOM QUINN 
Coach Ray Young's baseball
team upped its record to 7-3-1
over the weekend, capturing a
three game series from Cal Poly
(Pomona) with a double-header
sweep at Sunken Diamond on
Saturday. After dropping the first
game, 6-2, on Friday, only the
strong pitching performances of
Dan Shaw and Rod Boone gave
the Indians two victories and the
series, 7 -0 and 7 -2 .
Friday's problem of weak
pitching and suspect defense
seemed almost non-existent on
Saturday. Shaw had no trouble
handling Pomona and went the
distance, giving up only four hits
cn route to his third victory
against only one defeat.
In the offensive category,
Stanford pounded out 10 hits and
socked Cal Poly for six runs in the
fourth inning. Though the one run
pushed across in the third would
have held up for the victory, Dick
Borchers, Tom Williams, and Bob
Reece provided the insurance in
the big fourth, collecting two
RBl's each.
In the nightcap, the Indians
showed no signs of letting up the
earlier onslaught. Boone was in
complete control as Stanford built
up a 3-0 lead in the first four
innings.
When Boone showed signs of

wearing down in the latter half of
the game, Mike Nelson's bat took
care of any loose ends. First,
Nelson blasted a 345 -foot shot
over the right field fence with a
man on in the fifth to give the
Indians a 5-1 lead. Then in the
sixth, the hefty first baseman
collected his third and fourth
RBl's of the day with a single
between first and second.
Pomona offered little
resistance while Boone mopped
up the 7-2 victory, collecting his
second win in as manv starts.
The Indians meet U.C. at Davis
at Sunken Diamond on Tuesday
in quest of their eighth win.
