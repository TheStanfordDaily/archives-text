Devlin Visits Angela Davis
SAN FRANCISCO — Bernadette Devlin, the Northern Irish
activist, visited with black militant Angela Davis yesterday
afternoon in the Marin County Jail and later told a San
Francisco audience she thought the former UCLA
philosophy teacher is a victim of political oppression.
Miss Devlin, who had been searched before the
20-minute visit, refused to discuss her conversation with
Miss Davis, but said:
"I do believe Angela Davis and I are involved in the same
struggle.
"Her fight is like mine, for the liberation of her own
people. And I believe that were Angela Davis not black and
were she not Communist she would not be today in solitary
confinement in prison."
U.S. Increases Air Support
SAIGON — The United States has assembled the biggest air
armada of the Indochina war as a quick reaction force
designed to keep South Vietnamese troops from bogging
down in Laos and to deter North Vietnamese forces from
pushing across the demilitarized zone.
As many as 2,000 combat aircraft have been committed.
If the South Vietnamese run into trouble in Laos, as they
did over the weekend, American fighter-bombers and
gunships are expected to bail them out with massive
firepower.
Up to 1 ,5 00 U.S. combat planes and 500 helicopters of
all types, including gunships, are available for the air
campaign.

Air Force, Navy, Marine and Army aircraft all are being
diverted to Laos.
The air armada also makes it possible to resume
full-scale bombing of North Vietnam should enemy troops
move across the demilitarized zone to attack American
ground forces acting as a blocking force on the Vietnamese
side of the border for the Saigon drive into Laos.
President Nixon indicated during a news conference last
week that he would resume the bombing of North Vietnam
if these U.S. forces are threatened, and he said, "I am not
going to place any limitation upon the use of air power."
Too Much Vitamin C—Risky
NEW YORK — A chemist who was a member of the team
that isolated Vitamin C four decades ago warns that too
much of it "can be dangerous."
Dr. Charles Glen King, writing in the March issue of
McCall's magazine, referred to Dr. Linus Pauling's widely
publicized advice last November that the right amounts of
the vitamin at the right time would prevent most colds
from developing. Pauling also claimed that large doses of
the vitamin could ease the discomfort of colds that do
develop.
Dr. King cited FDA warnings that too much of the
vitamin may cause severe diarrhea, which he said can be
dangerous to children and the elderly and could
"conceivably" cause pregnant women to miscarry.
Because little is known about the effects of massive
doses of Vitamin C, he concluded, "it would seem to me
risky to follow Dr. Pauling's advice blindly." Pauling
himself has called for large-scale studies on the vitamin's
uses.
