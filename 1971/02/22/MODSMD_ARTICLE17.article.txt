# Dohrn Calls For New Concept Of Revolution
## 
### THOMAS B. FRICKE 
An emphatic but somewhat
exhausted Jennifer Dohrn told a crowd
of 100 which gathered in Engineering
lecture room 300 last Friday afternoon
that a "new conception of revolution
and people is coming," in which much
would be learned when people do all
they can, even die when necessary.
Dorhn, sister of Weatherwoman
Bernadine Dohrn, who is on the FBl's
"10 Most Wanted List," covered a
broad spectrum of subjects in her
hour-long "informal and informative
talk.
"I've just returned from the East
Coast and one place we heard from
during the long, cold winter was
Stanford," she began. "I want you to
know that knowledge makes a lot of
difference all across the nation."
The outspoken revolutionary
mentioned the upcoming anniversary of
the New York townhouse explosion in
which six weathermen were killed
saying, "A lot has happened in the
space of a year. It has given strength to
our combined struggle that we have an
underground dedicated to armed
struggle."

I)orhn said she was heartened by the
"recent fall offensive targets and
bombings." She slaimed that
confrontations do make a difference,
and cited the Atomic Energy
Commission riot in Berkeley in which
she and 5,000 others, many of whom
wore ceremonial war paint, clashed
with hundreds of gun-discharging
police.
"They (confrontations), are
important to Blacks in the ghetto, the
Vietnamese, chieanos in Los Angeles,
and others fighting, for they
demonstrate that the sturggle is an
ongoing one."
As she concluded her discussion,
Dorhn underscored the tremendous
frustration caused by a lack of national
leadership to coordinate actions.
"It is stronger and healthier when no
solutions are imposed by leaders," she
said. As examples of signs of
cooperation and communication,
Dohrn gave the New Morning
Statement which "talks about living
collectively and how to fight and build
revolution." She also read the Panther
21 statement, which praises the
Weatherman.
