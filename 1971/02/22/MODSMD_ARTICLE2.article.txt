# Grievance Hearings
## Keilch Challenges Review Board 
### TOM PAULU 
Library worker John Keilch
complained of ambiguity in the charges
leveled against him during the first two
sessions of his grievance hearings last
week. He also cited alleged
inconsistencies in the enforcement of
the campus rules under which he Ls
being prosecuted.
Keilch, who faces a three month
suspension for his participation in the
disruption of the Lodge speech, is
attempting to show that there is a
conspiracy against him among
University administrators.
Attendance at the hearings has been
sparse.
The three-man review board
questioned Keilch's supervisor, Director
of Libraries David C. Weber, and
Robert Nelson, director of personnel
and employee relations during the first
two hearings.
In both sessions, Keilch brought up
the question: who determines
"unacceptable behavior?" Weber stated
that, in Keilch's case, this was
determined by Assistant to the Provost
John Schwartz, who informed Weber
that some disciplinary action should be
taken. However Nelson later indicated
that it is generally left up to the
supervisor to determine if an employee
is guilty of "unacceptable behavior."
Much of Keilch's questioning was
directed at trying to demonstrate that
there is no single pre determined path
taken by the Administration when an
employee is charged with disobeying a
University policy, and that ambiguity
in the wording of the rules allows
administrators flexibility from case to
case.
Keilch charged that he is being
prosecuted now "with the same
accusations and for the same reasons"
as applied to persons not prosecuted in
last spring's disruptions.
He also objected to the fact that the
review board is made up of two
administrators and only one co-worker.

Those judging the case are: George T.
Gregory, a University legal counsel
chosen for the board by President
Lyman; Dr. Robert G. Lindee, a dean
of the medical school chosen by
Supervisor Weber; and James Berk,
electronics engineer at SLAC chosen by
Keilch.
A coalition group of University
workers has called a rally for noon

tomorrow to protest the proceedings
against Keilch and the laying off of 1 2
Tresidder employees last week. A
march to President Lyman's office to
demand that charges against Keilch be
dropped and the 1 2 workers re-instated
is planned after the rally.
The next session of the hearing is
scheduled for tomorrow at 4 :15 p.m. in
room 61 -H, Inner Quad.

NON-VIOLENCE—Twenty members of the faculty and staff voiced opposition to the war in a White Plaza rally held Friday.
Suggestions for action ranged from civil disobedience, advocated by Prof. Robert McAfee Brown, to enlisting the aid of
parents and alumni in a letter writing campaign to Washington. Over 300 people attended.
Library worker John Keilch
complained of ambiguity in the charges
leveled against him during the first two
sessions of his grievance hearings last
week. He also cited alleged
inconsistencies in the enforcement of
the campus rules under which he Ls
being prosecuted.
Keilch, who faces a three month
suspension for his participation in the
disruption of the Lodge speech, is
attempting to show that there is a
conspiracy against him among
University administrators.
Attendance at the hearings has been
sparse.
The three-man review board
questioned Keilch's supervisor, Director
of Libraries David C. Weber, and
Robert Nelson, director of personnel
and employee relations during the first
two hearings.
In both sessions, Keilch brought up
the question: who determines
"unacceptable behavior?" Weber stated
that, in Keilch's case, this was
determined by Assistant to the Provost
John Schwartz, who informed Weber
that some disciplinary action should be
taken. However Nelson later indicated
that it is generally left up to the
supervisor to determine if an employee
is guilty of "unacceptable behavior."
Much of Keilch's questioning was
directed at trying to demonstrate that
there is no single pre determined path
taken by the Administration when an
employee is charged with disobeying a
University policy, and that ambiguity
in the wording of the rules allows
administrators flexibility from case to
case.
Keilch charged that he is being
prosecuted now "with the same
accusations and for the same reasons"
as applied to persons not prosecuted in
last spring's disruptions.
He also objected to the fact that the
review board is made up of two
administrators and only one co-worker.

Those judging the case are: George T.
Gregory, a University legal counsel
chosen for the board by President
Lyman; Dr. Robert G. Lindee, a dean
of the medical school chosen by
Supervisor Weber; and James Berk,
electronics engineer at SLAC chosen by
Keilch.
A coalition group of University
workers has called a rally for noon

tomorrow to protest the proceedings
against Keilch and the laying off of 1 2
Tresidder employees last week. A
march to President Lyman's office to
demand that charges against Keilch be
dropped and the 1 2 workers re-instated
is planned after the rally.
The next session of the hearing is
scheduled for tomorrow at 4 :15 p.m. in
room 61 -H, Inner Quad.
