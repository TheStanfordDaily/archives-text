# Decision On SJC Seven; Suspensions Requested
## 
### JON DEDMON 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has recpijiOJended suspension of the
seven Lodge defendants for terms
ranging from one to four quarters.
In a letter to President Lyman, made
public on Friday, the SJC
recommended that:
—Janet Weiss be suspended from the
University for four consecutive
quarters.
—Jeffrey Youdelman be suspended
for four consecutive quarters, but that
suspension after the second quarter by
stayed during good behavior;
—Geraldine Foote and Theresa
Ramirez by suspended from the
University for four consecutive quarters
with the last three stayed during good
behavior;
—Michael Holman be suspended for
two consecutive quarters with one
quarter stayed;
—Bradley Dowden and Merle Rabine
be suspended for one quarter.
The Council's recommendations to
Lyman stated that "the testimony
offered indicated that each of the seven
defendants participated in the
disruptive activities — chanting,
rhythmic clapping to drown out
speakers, interjections ('oink, oink, and
shouted remarks)."
The seven had been before the
Council since January 28 on charges
that they disrupted Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge's scheduled Dinkelspiel
speech on January 11.
President Lyman said yesterday

afternoon that he had not yet seen the
recommendations.
The final decision as to what
sanctions will be imposed against the
seven is Lyman's.
The penalties recommended by the
SJC were somewhat lighter than those
asked for by Assistant to the Provost
John Schwartz.
At the final hearing of the case on
February 16, the lightest penalty
Schwartz had asked for was four
quarters suspension with two quarters
stayed for defendants Dowden, Foote,
Rabine, and Ramirez.
In recommending the suspensions,
several members of the SJC expressed
dissenting opinions.
Acceptable Behavior
SJC student member Tina Swent,
who voted against the Council's
February 9 ruling that a disruption had
occurred at the Lodge speech, charged
that the Council's findings were based
on "unrealistic assumptions concerning
the nature of an academic
community."
She went on to claim that the
behavior at the Lodge speech was
"acceptable, given the moral
responsibilities of a highly political
university."
SJC student member Leslie Kratter
also dissented, recommending lighter
penalties except in the case of Mr.
Holman.
A third SJC member dissented
recommending that the defendants

should only be reprimanded. The vote
on the recommendations was not
reported.
In other actions concerning the SJC,
the Council Thursday night
recommended that John Slade by given
one quarter suspended suspension.
Slade was the eighth student charged
with disruption of the Lodge speech
and had requested a separate hearing.
Five More Cases
The University also brought charges
against five more students Friday.
Three are charged with window
breaking at the Business School on
February 7, while two are charged with
roughing up a photographer who was
taking pictures of activities at the
Computation center on February 10.
Also, New Left Project member and
veteran Stanford radical Lenny Siegel is
being brought before the SJC for
activities relating to the Off-ROTC
movement last spring and the April
Third Movement in 1969.
Siegel is being charged under Section
11, A, 2 of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter which prescribes punishment of
students found in "gross violation of
the elemental standards of behavior
requisite to an academic community."
When asked if he felt the charges
have any political significance Siegel
said that Stanford just didn't like him
attending football games.
When asked to elaborate he
responded, "My mother always told me
that administrators, by their nature, try
to make martyrs."

activities relating to the Off-ROTC
movement last spring and the April
Third Movement in 1969.
Siegel is being charged under Section
11, A, 2 of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter which prescribes punishment of
students found in "gross violation of
the elemental standards of behavior
requisite to an academic community."
When asked if he felt the charges
have any political significance Siegel
said that Stanford just didn't like him
attending football games.
When asked to elaborate he
responded, "My mother always told me
that administrators, by their nature, try
to make martyrs."
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has recpijiOJended suspension of the
seven Lodge defendants for terms
ranging from one to four quarters.
In a letter to President Lyman, made
public on Friday, the SJC
recommended that:
—Janet Weiss be suspended from the
University for four consecutive
quarters.
—Jeffrey Youdelman be suspended
for four consecutive quarters, but that
suspension after the second quarter by
stayed during good behavior;
—Geraldine Foote and Theresa
Ramirez by suspended from the
University for four consecutive quarters
with the last three stayed during good
behavior;
—Michael Holman be suspended for
two consecutive quarters with one
quarter stayed;
—Bradley Dowden and Merle Rabine
be suspended for one quarter.
The Council's recommendations to
Lyman stated that "the testimony
offered indicated that each of the seven
defendants participated in the
disruptive activities — chanting,
rhythmic clapping to drown out
speakers, interjections ('oink, oink, and
shouted remarks)."
The seven had been before the
Council since January 28 on charges
that they disrupted Ambassador Henry
Cabot Lodge's scheduled Dinkelspiel
speech on January 11.
President Lyman said yesterday

afternoon that he had not yet seen the
recommendations.
The final decision as to what
sanctions will be imposed against the
seven is Lyman's.
The penalties recommended by the
SJC were somewhat lighter than those
asked for by Assistant to the Provost
John Schwartz.
At the final hearing of the case on
February 16, the lightest penalty
Schwartz had asked for was four
quarters suspension with two quarters
stayed for defendants Dowden, Foote,
Rabine, and Ramirez.
In recommending the suspensions,
several members of the SJC expressed
dissenting opinions.
Acceptable Behavior
SJC student member Tina Swent,
who voted against the Council's
February 9 ruling that a disruption had
occurred at the Lodge speech, charged
that the Council's findings were based
on "unrealistic assumptions concerning
the nature of an academic
community."
She went on to claim that the
behavior at the Lodge speech was
"acceptable, given the moral
responsibilities of a highly political
university."
SJC student member Leslie Kratter
also dissented, recommending lighter
penalties except in the case of Mr.
Holman.
A third SJC member dissented
recommending that the defendants

should only be reprimanded. The vote
on the recommendations was not
reported.
In other actions concerning the SJC,
the Council Thursday night
recommended that John Slade by given
one quarter suspended suspension.
Slade was the eighth student charged
with disruption of the Lodge speech
and had requested a separate hearing.
Five More Cases
The University also brought charges
against five more students Friday.
Three are charged with window
breaking at the Business School on
February 7, while two are charged with
roughing up a photographer who was
taking pictures of activities at the
Computation center on February 10.
Also, New Left Project member and
veteran Stanford radical Lenny Siegel is
being brought before the SJC for
activities relating to the Off-ROTC
movement last spring and the April
Third Movement in 1969.

11, A, 2 of the Legislative and Judicial
