# Venceremos Stresses Action, Not Theory
## 
### ED KOHN (First in a series) 
(Editor's note: This is the first in a series of
news analyses describing political activism —
both on the Right and on the — found on
the Stanford campus. Other articles will describe
some of the various movements over the past five
years and attempt to place in context some of
the recent campus developments. Today's article
deals with one of the more influential Left
groups, Venceremus.)
Those familiar, bright red Venceremos
buttons — and many people wearing them — have
taken on a new significance in recent weeks. To
the University administration and the Trustees,
they represent at least the potential for "great
and irreparable injury."
To the conservative Free Campus Movement,
Venceremos represents a movement that intends
to shut down the campus and its members
constitute a threat to their persons.
And to many members of the Stanford
community, the AK-4 7 emblazoned-button
wearers are sections of a puzzle which is missing
some pieces.
But a few pieces of information — admittedly
incomplete, because like many revolutionary
groups, Venceremos chooses to keep much of its
modus operandi secret — about the group have
surfaced.
Venceremos is a multinational, revolutionary,
Marxist-Leninist organization based in Hedwood
City. Its members are organized into 10-12
person "collectives," will) collective members

known as "cadre." During some actions, some
collectives apparently break down into "affinity
groups" of three to five members.
Size Unclear
The exact size of the group remains unclear;
there are both "open" (public) and "closed"
(unpublicized) members. Individual members are
not permitted to know the total membership of
the group for "security reasons"; none will even
hazzard a public guess. One student who studies
Midpeninsula politics estimated its strength at
about 4 00.
The collectives operate independently in
conjunction with the group's Central Committee,
of which suspended Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife .Jane, and Aaron Manganiello are members.
Venceremos follows a policy of "democratic
centralism," where, after discussion (frequently
referred to as "criticism,") all of the group's
members agree to abide by the majority decision.
Ties With Other Croups
The group maintains close — if not
interlocking — ties with many organizations,
including the People's Medical Center and
Venceremos College in Redwood City; the
Midpeninsula Free University, the now defunct
Free You, and the Palo Alto Tenants' Union in
Palo Alto; and the Partisans (formerly the Young
Partisans), a revolutionary high-school
organization which is active in at least three local
schools and publishes ('lass Struggle. On campus,
Venceremos is tied in with the Radical Caucus,
an operationally defunct umbrella group for
other radical oi^.ni'vions (including last year's

Off-ROTC Movement), the Workers' Action
Caucus, the Labor Action Croup, the Stanford
Workers Against the War, and the Stanford
Community Against War and Fascism, to name a
few.
It is also closely allied with other collectives in
California, Oregon, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
and the South. Venceremos gained much of its
current strength on the Midpeninsula when an
ideological split developed within the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union, a larger group centered in
the East Bay.
Revolutionary Union Split
In December, following months of argument,
most Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union, charging it had
downplayed the vanguard role of the Black
Panther Party and had become "racist," had
adopted an "incorrect" position on the
importance and timing of armed struggle, and
that it had become "revisionist."
Most of the people in the splinter faction
joined Venceremos, which had already been in
existence for almost a year in Redwood City,
which is a predominately chicano community.
Venceremos' leadership - the Central Committee
— is always composed of at least 50 percent
Third World peoples, and is now, according to
one member, at least 50 percent chicano.
The group's name. Venceremos, is Spanish for
"we will win." The slogan, "Venceremos" wa*-
first popularized by Field Castro during the
Cuban Revolution is now used by uroiipsof
American voung people cut ting sugar cane I here.

There is no organization link between
Venceremos and the Venceremos Brigades.
United Front Politics
Venceremos holds practice (and action) over
theory; its principle objective is to "serve the
people" and "to raise their level of (political)
consciousness." Members of the organization are
subject to collective discipline which, among
other practices, prohibits the use of marijuana at
parties. Many members take marksmanship
courses and train themselves how to use pistols,
rifles and shotguns, and most do their
"revolutionary physical exercises" regularly.
The group operates along the principles of a
"united front . .. where you consolidate the
left, join forces with the middle, to isolate the
right," one member said. Venceremos believes
that the present united front on campus
"includes all people, all groups, which are
anti-imperialist."
Members of the group are quick to point out
that not everything the group does is violent.
Panther Vanguard
"We're not trying to organize people to go out
and trash things. In fact, we sa> people should do
what they can (to end (lie war); if that means not
paying the tax on your telephone bill, if you
want to write letters to your Congressman,
peacefully picket something ... that's OK."
The group views the Black Panther Party as
the vanguard of the American Revolution and
some of its forthcoming literature will "strongly
resemble" similar Panther tracts.

United Front Politics
Venceremos holds practice (and action) over
theory; its principle objective is to "serve the
people" and "to raise their level of (political)
consciousness." Members of the organization are
subject to collective discipline which, among
other practices, prohibits the use of marijuana at
parties. Many members take marksmanship
courses and train themselves how to use pistols,
rifles and shotguns, and most do their
"revolutionary physical exercises" regularly.
The group operates along the principles of a
"united front . .. where you consolidate the
left, join forces with the middle, to isolate the
right," one member said. Venceremos believes
that the present united front on campus
"includes all people, all groups, which are
anti-imperialist."
Members of the group are quick to point out
that not everything the group does is violent.
Panther Vanguard
"We're not trying to organize people to go out
and trash things. In fact, we sa> people should do
what they can (to end (lie war); if that means not
paying the tax on your telephone bill, if you
want to write letters to your Congressman,
peacefully picket something ... that's OK."
The group views the Black Panther Party as
the vanguard of the American Revolution and
some of its forthcoming literature will "strongly
resemble" similar Panther tracts.

news analyses describing political activism —
both on the Right and on the — found on
the Stanford campus. Other articles will describe
some of the various movements over the past five
years and attempt to place in context some of
the recent campus developments. Today's article
deals with one of the more influential Left
groups, Venceremus.)
Those familiar, bright red Venceremos
buttons — and many people wearing them — have
taken on a new significance in recent weeks. To
the University administration and the Trustees,
they represent at least the potential for "great
and irreparable injury."
To the conservative Free Campus Movement,
Venceremos represents a movement that intends
to shut down the campus and its members
constitute a threat to their persons.
And to many members of the Stanford
community, the AK-4 7 emblazoned-button
wearers are sections of a puzzle which is missing
some pieces.
But a few pieces of information — admittedly
incomplete, because like many revolutionary
groups, Venceremos chooses to keep much of its
modus operandi secret — about the group have
surfaced.
Venceremos is a multinational, revolutionary,
Marxist-Leninist organization based in Hedwood
City. Its members are organized into 10-12
person "collectives," will) collective members

known as "cadre." During some actions, some
collectives apparently break down into "affinity
groups" of three to five members.
Size Unclear
The exact size of the group remains unclear;
there are both "open" (public) and "closed"
(unpublicized) members. Individual members are
not permitted to know the total membership of
the group for "security reasons"; none will even
hazzard a public guess. One student who studies
Midpeninsula politics estimated its strength at
about 4 00.
The collectives operate independently in
conjunction with the group's Central Committee,
of which suspended Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife .Jane, and Aaron Manganiello are members.
Venceremos follows a policy of "democratic
centralism," where, after discussion (frequently
referred to as "criticism,") all of the group's
members agree to abide by the majority decision.
Ties With Other Croups
The group maintains close — if not
interlocking — ties with many organizations,
including the People's Medical Center and
Venceremos College in Redwood City; the
Midpeninsula Free University, the now defunct
Free You, and the Palo Alto Tenants' Union in
Palo Alto; and the Partisans (formerly the Young
Partisans), a revolutionary high-school
organization which is active in at least three local
schools and publishes ('lass Struggle. On campus,
Venceremos is tied in with the Radical Caucus,
an operationally defunct umbrella group for
other radical oi^.ni'vions (including last year's

Off-ROTC Movement), the Workers' Action
Caucus, the Labor Action Croup, the Stanford
Workers Against the War, and the Stanford
Community Against War and Fascism, to name a
few.
It is also closely allied with other collectives in
California, Oregon, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
and the South. Venceremos gained much of its
current strength on the Midpeninsula when an
ideological split developed within the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union, a larger group centered in
the East Bay.
Revolutionary Union Split
In December, following months of argument,
most Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union, charging it had
downplayed the vanguard role of the Black
Panther Party and had become "racist," had
adopted an "incorrect" position on the
importance and timing of armed struggle, and
that it had become "revisionist."
Most of the people in the splinter faction
joined Venceremos, which had already been in
existence for almost a year in Redwood City,
which is a predominately chicano community.
Venceremos' leadership - the Central Committee
— is always composed of at least 50 percent

The group maintains close — if not
interlocking — ties with many organizations,
including the People's Medical Center and
Venceremos College in Redwood City; the
Midpeninsula Free University, the now defunct
Free You, and the Palo Alto Tenants' Union in
Palo Alto; and the Partisans (formerly the Young
Partisans), a revolutionary high-school
organization which is active in at least three local
schools and publishes ('lass Struggle. On campus,
Venceremos is tied in with the Radical Caucus,
an operationally defunct umbrella group for
other radical oi^.ni'vions (including last year's

Off-ROTC Movement), the Workers' Action
Caucus, the Labor Action Croup, the Stanford
Workers Against the War, and the Stanford
Community Against War and Fascism, to name a
few.
It is also closely allied with other collectives in
California, Oregon, Michigan, New York, Ohio,
and the South. Venceremos gained much of its
current strength on the Midpeninsula when an
ideological split developed within the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union, a larger group centered in
the East Bay.
Revolutionary Union Split
In December, following months of argument,
most Midpeninsula radicals left the
Revolutionary Union, charging it had
downplayed the vanguard role of the Black
Panther Party and had become "racist," had
adopted an "incorrect" position on the
importance and timing of armed struggle, and
that it had become "revisionist."
Most of the people in the splinter faction
joined Venceremos, which had already been in
existence for almost a year in Redwood City,
which is a predominately chicano community.
Venceremos' leadership - the Central Committee
— is always composed of at least 50 percent
Third World peoples, and is now, according to
one member, at least 50 percent chicano.
The group's name. Venceremos, is Spanish for
"we will win." The slogan, "Venceremos" wa*-
first popularized by Field Castro during the
Cuban Revolution is now used by uroiipsof
American voung people cut ting sugar cane I here.

There is no organization link between
Venceremos and the Venceremos Brigades.
United Front Politics
Venceremos holds practice (and action) over
theory; its principle objective is to "serve the
people" and "to raise their level of (political)
consciousness." Members of the organization are
subject to collective discipline which, among
other practices, prohibits the use of marijuana at
parties. Many members take marksmanship
courses and train themselves how to use pistols,
rifles and shotguns, and most do their
"revolutionary physical exercises" regularly.
The group operates along the principles of a
"united front . .. where you consolidate the
left, join forces with the middle, to isolate the
right," one member said. Venceremos believes
that the present united front on campus
"includes all people, all groups, which are
anti-imperialist."
Members of the group are quick to point out
that not everything the group does is violent.
Panther Vanguard
"We're not trying to organize people to go out
and trash things. In fact, we sa> people should do
what they can (to end (lie war); if that means not
paying the tax on your telephone bill, if you
want to write letters to your Congressman,
peacefully picket something ... that's OK."
The group views the Black Panther Party as
the vanguard of the American Revolution and
some of its forthcoming literature will "strongly
resemble" similar Panther tracts.

(Editor's note: This is the first in a series of
news analyses describing political activism —
both on the Right and on the — found on
the Stanford campus. Other articles will describe
some of the various movements over the past five
years and attempt to place in context some of
the recent campus developments. Today's article
deals with one of the more influential Left
groups, Venceremus.)
Those familiar, bright red Venceremos
buttons — and many people wearing them — have
taken on a new significance in recent weeks. To
the University administration and the Trustees,
they represent at least the potential for "great
and irreparable injury."
To the conservative Free Campus Movement,
Venceremos represents a movement that intends
to shut down the campus and its members
constitute a threat to their persons.
And to many members of the Stanford
community, the AK-4 7 emblazoned-button
wearers are sections of a puzzle which is missing
some pieces.
But a few pieces of information — admittedly
incomplete, because like many revolutionary
groups, Venceremos chooses to keep much of its
modus operandi secret — about the group have
surfaced.
Venceremos is a multinational, revolutionary,
Marxist-Leninist organization based in Hedwood
City. Its members are organized into 10-12
person "collectives," will) collective members

known as "cadre." During some actions, some
collectives apparently break down into "affinity
groups" of three to five members.
Size Unclear
The exact size of the group remains unclear;
there are both "open" (public) and "closed"
(unpublicized) members. Individual members are
not permitted to know the total membership of
the group for "security reasons"; none will even
hazzard a public guess. One student who studies
Midpeninsula politics estimated its strength at
about 4 00.
The collectives operate independently in
conjunction with the group's Central Committee,
of which suspended Prof. H. Bruce Franklin, his
wife .Jane, and Aaron Manganiello are members.
Venceremos follows a policy of "democratic
centralism," where, after discussion (frequently
referred to as "criticism,") all of the group's
members agree to abide by the majority decision.
