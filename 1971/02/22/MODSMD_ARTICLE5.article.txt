## Study Recognizes Options

After eight months of study
and widespread consultation, the
San Francisco planning consulting
firm of Livingston and Blayney
has given Stanford what 1 believe
to be an excellent new land use
"Policy/Flan" that is timely,
flexible and responsible.
Current influences also have
been taken into consideration.
These include the unprecedented
growth of the Mid-Peninsula; its
increasing role as a regional center
of the San Francisco Metropolitan
area, and the changing pattern of
the academic community. Such
changes are exemplified by the
area's housing needs, traffic
problems, environmental concerns
and the University's financial
requirements.
The plan is flexible because it
offers numerous options for
future land use. It recognizes that
the desirability of certain options
depends upon needs and
considerations which may become
increasingly evident in the future.
Firm recommendations are made
only where it can be logically
indicated that a proposed land use
is consistent with the overall
needs and plans of the University
and of our neighboring
communities.
Livingston and Blayney are
saying in effect to the University:
Set aside additional land for
future academic use (from 5 600
to 6200 of the 8100 available
acres); expand the present campus

within that reserve; commit seven
areas to open space; proceed with
land development along the flanks
of the campus to earn revenue for
education, and consider
alternative uses for five other
major areas.
Included in the land
development program would be
research parks in two new areas, a
public golf course west of Coyote
Hill and residential areas at the
southern edge of the campus, near
Portola Valley and Woodside.
In the areas where future uses
are not obvious- -and may not be
obvious for many
years—Livingston and Blayney
recommend keeping the choices
open. Thus Interdale and the
500-acre section of Webb Ranch
west of Junipero Serra Freeway
could be added to the Academic
Reserve or be developed for
housing; Webb Ranch East could
be Academic Reserve or a future
research park; Guernsey Field
near the Sand Hill-Whiskey Hill
Road intersection could be used
for housing or future research
park, and a Willow Road site
across from the Medical Center,
for future offices or medical
center related uses.
The report cautions that low
and moderate income housing
should be mixed with
market-priced housing areas on
Stanford lands lest "ghetto
pockets" be created on small,
isolated sites.

Livingston and Blayney also
suggest concrete ways for the
University to implement the new
plan. Explore the Williamson Act,
they say, to find out how lands
may be held in open space at
reduced taxes; seek to have the
law amended so that severe
penalties are not paid on land
later removed from the land bank
for academic purposes.
With the University's highest
priority traditionally given to its
academic needs, in my opinion it
is most likely that many of the
optional areas described in the
report will be held in Academic-
Reserve pending the educational
requirements of the future.
In their review of past plans
and practices and formulation of
recommendations for the future,
Livingston and Blayney- a firm I
believe to have succeeded in
balancing sensitivity and
realism—sought the advice of
numerous area and campus
organizations, the latter consisting
of faculty, staff, students and
Trustees. The University will
continue wide consultations as it
weighs the impact of the many
alternatives set forth in the report.
The Policy/Plan is responsible
because it calls for a blend of
academic expansion, open space,
housing and income-producing
uses. If any one of those were to
be excluded the effect would be
deleterious to the University
and/or its neighbors. It always has
been my firm conviction that
because of the extent and location
of Stanford's lands, the University
must assume a deep responsibility
to itself and its neighbors to
sponsor the highest possible
planning standards. I believe that
the Livingston and Blaney
Policy/Plan bases its
recommendations on recognition
of this responsibility.

University Director of Planning.)
