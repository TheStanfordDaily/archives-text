## Two Fundamental Errors Affect Plan 
### 
The Livingston and Blayney
Report on Stanford Land Use has
just been published and time will
be required to review the text of
the material. Hopefully, the
report will act as a focus for
concern about how Stanford uses
its land- whether for open space,
housing, or commercial
development.
But it is exceedingly important
to understand how this plan was
formulated before focusing on it
at all. Two fundamental decisions
were made in the beginning that
undermine the conclusions of the
report.
In April of 1970 the Board of
'IVustees approved the hiring of
Livingston and Blayney, planning
consultants, "to review and
update land use plans for the
academic and non-academic lands
of the University." When Mr.
Livingston was hired for this job a
number of students wrote Dr.
Pitzer protesting his selection.
Livingston had just completed

a major study of the foothills on
behalf of the City of Palo Alto.
We did not believe he could begin
to take a fresh look at Stanford
lands when he had already
decided how certain portions
should be used. Despite good
intentions, his prior decisions in
the Palo Alto report locked him in
to certain decisions regarding
Stanford lands. For this reason,
and not for any lack of
competence, the hiring Livingston
and Blayney was a mistake.
The charge given to Livingston
was a broad one. However, he
chose to interpret it very narrowly
by concentrating his attention
solely on development. He asked
only what lands could be
developed and what types of
development would be
appropriate. The fundamental
question of whether the land
should be developed at all, was
never posed. Livingston
considered how best to develop

the lands, not how best to use
them.
The acceptance by the
University of this approach was
the second mistake and as a result
the entire report is founded on
the same growth ethic that
brought us our current urban
sprawl.
For too many years, Stanford
and surrounding communities
have developed their lands with
little consideration for the impact
they were having on the nature of
the total community. Such single
purpose planning is totally
unacceptable at a lime when
people cannot find homes and
have little recreational or open
land to enjoy.
By hiring a land use consultant
the University could have made a
complete reappraisal of its land
use policy. But at the very
beginning of the study, these two
fundamental errors were made
and the opportunity for freshness
and objective reanalysis was lost.

The report can only be viewed in
this context.
However, there is something
that can be done to compensate
for these mistakes. In spite of
deficiencies, a tremendous
amount of hitherto unknown data
has been gathered and the entire
issue of land use has been brought
to public attention. What is now
needed is full and open debate on
the quality of the analysis and
conclusions of the Livingston
report.
The President's Advisory
Committee on Land and Builidng
Development should hold public
hearings on the report to permit
both Stanford groups and
surrounding communities to
express their views. We will ask
for such a public hearing at
today's meeting of the Land
Development Committee.
We urge all who are interested
to study the report and come to
the hearings to express their
views.
