## wrong priorities Business Values Represented 
### 
We believe Livingston and
Blaney land development
proposals represent the values of
the university's business and
development office in conflict
with the needs of Stanford as an
educational institution and its
responsibilities as a social
institution.
As an educational institution,
the university seeks to enlarge,
reappraise and renew our cultural
heritage. As a business, the
university exploits
resources—both human and
natural—to provide the
institution's budget.
A particular part of the
heritage of the univeristy is
extremely fragile—the setting in
which the artist or scholar gropes
for approximations to beauty,
faith, freedom and love.
In a biological sense, there are
limits upon the development
activities of the business office:
the rupture of the carrying
capacity of the natural
environment. Those are unlikely

to be reached by the activities of a
singel developer. But there is also
a limit upon the university as a
business in a social and aesthetic
sense. It is the point at which the
teachings of the university are
made meaningless because the
values they once applied and
strove for have been crowded,
developed and de-humanized out
of existence.
We believe that approval of the
Livingston proposals for foothill
industrial development would lead
to that end. We offer an
alternative in the context of the
burden that past Stanford
development has placed on the
Peninsula, its citizens and
environment.
Stanford Lands and War
The leasing of Stanford
Industrial Park began at the peak
of cold war tensions during the
period in which John Foster
Dulles assembled nuclear
deterance as the cornerstone of
American foreign policy.
Industrial park development
spearheaded a trend which now
finds 60 percent of all
manufacturing employment in
Santa Clara county concentrated
in aerospace and electronics work.
The result if a multi-faceted
misfortune: the economy is
unstable due to its concentration
in the defense sector;
unemployment is over seven
percent overall, much higher in
defense-oriented industry;
scientists, engineers and
production workers with deep
moral dilemmas about working for
the Defense Department in the
wake of Vietnam are unable to
find civilian employment.
An alternative and humane
industrial development policy is
possible. We urge the university to
require all future leases to contain
restrictive covenants against
classified research. Secondly, we
urge that the business office direct
its recruitment efforts toward
attracting industry that would be
most likely to provide civilian
employment to the two pools of
unemployed in this area: 1 )

underskilled minority group
members and 2 ) defense workers
who wish to covert their skills to
peacetime employment.
Specifically, the university might
seek out tennants that will apply
the skills of aerospace technicians
to the problems of health care
delivery, pollution control
hardward, public transit and
low-cost modular unit housing.
Stanford Lands and Housing
The development of Stanford
lands for revenue purposes has
created 21 ,250 industrial and
commercial sector jobs. There has
not been a proportionate
development of univsity land for
housing (only 9 00 units.) with the
result that employment has
pressured the housing market:
inflating both cost and demand.
During the past decade, a
dwindling land supply, "tight
money," and high construction
costs have limited new housing
starts. In this situation, there is
little "filtering down" of old
housing to prices that can be
afforded by low income renters or
purchasers. In fact, for low
income people, housing costs have
increased startlingly as a
percentage of household income.
The result is sadly visible in the
ghettoizing of minority families
east of Bayshore Freeway.
The environmental results are
also extremely critical. Unplanned
and speculative development on
the Peninsula has left long
distances between housing and
employment. The results have
been huge public investments in
streets and freeways (second only
to the public investment in
schools), the loss of land to
concrete, and a huge volume of air
pollution. The Stanford Census
Tract has the largest discrepancy
between employment and housing
in Santa Clara County: six to one.
We urge that the
university build one unit of
housing for every two jobs created
on Stanford lands.
The profit reduction (roughly
3 to 2) from industrial to
residential uses might be

; users rate for cars parking in
) university lots.
L As an immediate step, we urge
, the university to vehemently
oppose the construction of the
' Willow Expressway which would
I destroy as mahy as 400 units of
I low to moderate income housing.
Stanford Lands and Open Space
Twenty square miles of Bay
Area open space are lost to
development each year. That
figure assumes its appropriate
aesthetic and ecological
implication when we recognize
the small amount of accessible
and undeveloped land in either
the foothills or baylands.
The Livingston Report makes
no consession to open space
where development is remotely
feasible.
The report seems to assume a
distorted and perverted sense of
equivalency: it is appropriate to
develop one parcel if another is
put in safe-keeping—regardless of
the beauty, accessability or
scarcity of land in question.
We urge commitment of all
Stanford lands in the foothills
west of Junipero Serra Freeway to
permanent open space agriculture
under the tax advantage
provisions of the Williamson Land
Conservation Act. We urge study
of the costs of placing Coyote Hill
and Webb Rancy under
Williamson Act protection.
Recognizing that a program of
social and environmental
responsibility if likely to cost in
terms of unrealized profit, we
would note that the program
outlines;
1) Amounts to a profit of
$200,000 annually- the amount
of taxes currently paid on land
used for agriculture but assessed
its full development potential.
2) Should be realistically
compared against an annual six
per return on the investment of
development revenues- a figure
between $5 00,000 and $1.5
million annually.
3) Or an alternative source of
revenue such as the sale of parking
stickers to each of 10,000
Stanford vehicles at $2 0 for each
of three quarters resulting in a
return of $6 00,000 annually-or
an amount equal to the six
percent investment return on the
industrial development of Webb
Ranch East, Guernsey Field and
Sa.dhill-SLAC.
We must conclude
emphatically that the resources of
open space should be preserved
for the solace and inspiration of
future generations. And, where
commercial or industrial
develop m en t bee o m e s
unavoidable, it should invariably
be paired with compatible housing
development. Under no
circumstances should Stanford
land be leased for purposes which
shall include classified research or
production.
