# black community suffering incidental
## Report Ignores Black Needs 
###

The Black Students Union has
(again) been asked to react to
suggestions regarding the land use
policies of Stanford University.
Not too long ago the question
would have inevitably been what
the hell do niggers have to say
about how Stanford uses its land.
Certainly the question has just
been posed in many of your own
minds. These comments are
intended not as a critique of the
land use report, but to present
some issues and concerns that are
usually ignored, or when
presented, grossly distorted.
The most important point
revolves around the impact of
Stanford's decisions for
surrounding communities of Black
and other people of color. The
two are clearly related. The
Livingston/ Blayney land use
report, despite platitudes of
educational eminence, natural
beauty, and broadening the
University's contribution to
society, gives a clear hint to the
priority it assigns consideration of
the Black community. "The other
key issue in the Willow Freeway
controversy is the fact that
270-4 30 dwelling units will have
to be removed, depending on the
route selected. Many of these
units house low-moderate income
families..." But the implication
(and it is more than that) is that
Stanford should really not give a
damn hecauce "the freeway is
needed to serve the shopping
center, the Welch road office area
and the Medical Center, and to
relieve roads of through traffic."
If nothing more, the above
quote from the land use report
should tell us whose interests and
what considerations will be most
important to Stanford in deciding
how its land will be used. But
perhaps more important, it reveals
a whole system that
systematically operates to the
detriment of Black and other poor
communities. Stanford's support
of the Willow Expressway
provides an excellent illustration.
First the facts on Willow and
the Black East Bayshore
community. The proposed route
of the expressway will have the
effect of destroying a total of 164
living units in the community.
Over 400 people will be dislodged
from their homes. It should be
noted that the possibility of
saving the apartments and using
part of the Kavanaugh Industrial
Park development across the
street has been almost ruled out.
Almost all of the 4 00 tenants to
be removed are Black (Urban
renewal@nigger removal). These
400 will be affected directly. But
the East Bayshore Black
community is already faced with a
severe housing shortage. If
adequate housing replacements
are not provided for the units
destroyed, (and there are few
places they could be built) the
entire East Bayshore community
will suffer from the Willow
Expressway. The effects will
include increased rents due to
greater demand for fewer housing
units, additional overcowding.
Suffering is Incidental
My point is simply that the
Willow Expressway will more than
likely be built as it is planned. The
fact that the Black community
will suffer immensely is merely
incidental and just too bad. The
powers that be Stanford, Palo
Alto, Santa Clara County, Menlo
Park, and San Mateo County
receive great benefits.
This gets us into the Kerner
Commission's popularization of
the ghetto-as-colony analogy;
"What white Americans have
never fully understood-but what
the Negro (sic) can never
forget—is that white society is
deeply implicated in the ghetto.
White institutions created it,
white institutions maintain it, and
white society condones it." The
East bayshore black community
has been maintained as a colony
and can be infringed upon
without difficulty whenever the
needs of the colonial rulers so
dictate.
Now! The secret is out, but the
game ain't been stopped. East
Palo Alto, with over 20,000
people (80% Black), is presently
an unincorporated non-entity
governed by San Mateo County,
with the advice of a locally
elected quasi-body. Even if they
did oppose the expressway (and it
is not entirely clear that they do)
they have no legal authority to
make their opposition binding.
And the relationship of Belle
Haven to Menlo Park is one that is
no less than a colony.
White Interests
It is in this context of powerful
white interests pursuing their
profits and powerless Black
interests being able to only watch
helplessly from the sidelines (or
through the fence of the
soon-to-be constructed Willow
Freeway) that the Livingston
report and related matters must
be analyzed. It has been reported

that in studying alternative land
uses, Livingston and Blayney said
that they gave "detailed
examination to all pertinent
factors such as employment,
housing, traffic, net income, and
ecological and visual
implications."
The report is also said to
recognize that the University's
academic needs and financial
requirements, coupled with
increasing public concern that
lands be kept open for aesthetic
and environmental reasons, pose
difficult problems that must be
worked out." Kor the Black
community, the question becomes
whose employment, housing,
traffic, net income, and ecology is
being looked at, and in whose
favor are these issues to be
worked out. The answers to these
questions clearly indicate that
Stanford University functions to
destroy black communities.
It is often stated that the use
to which Stanford has already put
its land has in large measure
created the need for expansion of
Willow Road. The
industrial/commercial/office
development thus far has created
employment and has attracted
people whose demands for
housing strains the existing
housing supply and causes an
increase in rents. Black and poor
people suffer most. Jobs have
been created. But the job supply
has been "twisted" by the kind of
development Stanford has
undertaken such that the jobs
available are the tech
nico-scientific and skilled trades
from which people of color have
been excluded.
Multiplier Effect
And the call for new
development—regardless of how it
is sugar-coated—can only mean an
intensification of the above trends
which are harmful in terms of
employment and housing. And it
should not be beyond us (as it
appears to be beyond those who
are paid to sugar-coat and sell
these "Projects for Progress" to a
gullible public) to recognize the
"multiplier" effect of Stanford's
development plans and the Willow
Expressway. • For example, how
long will it be before "fortuitous"
increases in the profitability of
Stanford industrial and
commercial lands argue that the
newly build expressway must be
widened to 6 or 8 lanes to meet
increased use, thus destroying
more of the Black community.
Or, how long before the easier
access via the expressway makes
the possible profits from
industrial development of the
entire east Bayshore Black
community become so great that

any residential use becomes
unprofitable.
At the heart of this discussion
is the concept of "Black
Ecology," and how an
understanding of this concept will
help us to overcome many of the
distortions that are currently
rampant in most discussions of
issues like Stanford's land use
policies and the Willow
Expressway; that Stanford is
contributing to the destruction of
the Black environment should be
clear. But that many of those who
will raise voices of protest on
ecology-related grounds will
almost totally miss the real causes
and solutions to the
environmental problems of Black
communities is inevitable. The
real causes and the solutions to
the Black ecology crisis are
precluded by the basic value
assumptions underlying the white
ecology movement.
These values emphasize that
beaches are no longer suitable for
wading, swimming, boating, or
just looking at. The focus, in the
words of Black ecologist Nathan
Hare, is on "the planting of
redwood trees, saving the
American eagle, and redeeming
terrestial beauty." But ecology
from a Black perspective would
focus not just on the facts of
pollution or overcrowding, but
the greater incidence of both in
communities of color as a result
of decisions made outside of these
communities.
More Overcrowding
Further industrial or
commercial development of
Stanford's land can only mean
greater overcrowding of local
communities like East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park. And the
34,000 cars who will use the
Expressway by 19 74 are like alien
polluters who will increasingly
continue to harm the environment
of Black residents.
The real solution to the
problems generated by Stanford's
land use patterns and the projects
like the Willow Expressway
dictated by such development is
the effective and immediate
decolonization of Black and other
communities of color.
Communities like East Palo Alto
and East Menlo Park must wrest
the same power of
self-determination that allows
Portola Valley or Los Altos to
determine the quality of its
existence. And until this occurs,
atrocities like the Willow
Expressway will continue. And so
will decisions which perpetuate
the Willow Expressway syndrome,
like Stanford land use policies.
