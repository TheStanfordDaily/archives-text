# A 						Fair Trial For Angela Davis?

### 
Commentary
"You felt that the philosophical idea
(human freedom), unless it ivas a lie,
must be translated into reality: that it
contained a moral imperative to leave
the classroom, the campus, and to go
and help the others, your own people
to whom you still belong-in spite of
(or perhaps because of) your success
within the white Establishment.
"But you fought for us, too, who
need freedom and who want freedom
for all who are still unfree. In this
sense, your cause is our cause. "
â€”From Herbert Marcuse's . letter to
Angela Davis.
Angela Davis, called a political
prisoner, is currently held without bail
on charges of murder, kidnapping, and
conspiracy with the first two carrying
the death penalty.
A friend of the four black girls who
were killed in 1963 when a bomb
exploded in a Birmingham church, she
has been a center of controversy since
disclosure of her membership in the
Che Lumumba Club of the Communist
Party.
That prompted the California
Regents to fire her from her job as
assistant philosophy professor at

U.C.L.A. Overruled by the courts, the
Regents refused to rehire her last
summer because her public speeches
contained "inflammatory rhetoric."
In a speech cited by the Regents, the
27-year-old Davis said it was necessary
"to unveil the predominant, oppresive
ideas and acts of this country" and "to
begin to develop not only criticism but
positive solutions and to carry out
these paths in the universities.
Otherwise academic freedom is a real
farce."
On the June day the Regents
terminated her contract, Davis was
speaking with Jonathan Jackson on the
steps of the state building in L.A. on
behalf of the Soledad Brothers
advocating their release from custody.
The Brothers, George Jackson, Fleeta
Drumgo, John Clutchette, are accused
of killing a guard three days after a
guard shot four convicts, three of
whom died.
This appearance together is the
Overt Act which is used to show
conspiracy in the Marin County
shoot-out. In the incident, Jonathan
Jackson smuggled into the court four
guns which were used to free three

prisoners and take five hostages. In the
escape, Jackson, two prisoners, and the
judge were killed.
Hostages
The hostages were apparently to be
used to free the Soledad Brothers. At
tht double funeral, Huey Newton
eulogized the men, "the Black Panther
Party serves notice that it is not
brothers Jonathan Jackson and William
A. Christmas for whom we should
weep. They have achieved freedom and
we remain slaves.
"When laws no longer serve the
people, it is the people's right and the
people's duty to free themselves from
the yoke of such laws."
Miss Davis allegedly purchased the
guns used in the abortive escape
attempt. But Norton Tooby, discussion
leader at the Angela Davis Teach-in
Saturday, remarked, "The police have
to prove if Angela's guns were the ones
used at Marin. The guns the police have
are Angela's but are those the ones that
were used? No one recorded the serial
numbers or marked the guns found in
any way. The police suddenly came up
with guns."
The Teach-In, sponsored by the
BSU, Black law students, Concerned
Residents of Stern Hall, and the
Committee for Angela Davis Teach-In,
provided insights into the case from
knowledge gained from people who
have been closest to it.
Allan Brotsky, one of Miss Davis'
lawyers and a partner of Charles Garry;
Cassandra Davis, chairlady of the
Angela Davis Defense Fund; and
Kendra Alexandra, member of the
National Committee of the Communist
Party, spoke on aspects of the case.
Apparently other evidence besides

the Overt Act and the guns includes the
fact that a black woman was seen in a
yellow Ford van the day before the
deaths. Brotsky labeled the evidence as
"weak as any we have ever seen in a
comparable case."
The weakness of the case supports
Davis' statement at her arraignment, "I
stand before this court as an innocent
person, the victim of a political
frame-up."
Prejudice is directed against her
because she is young, black, militant,
Communist, and a woman. Prosecutor
Albert Harris, assistant district
attorney, says, "We have never said
anything about her political beliefs.
She's the one who keeps saying she's a
Communist. We've never said that, and
it's not material."
Brotsky related, "Marin County has
a miniscule black population, it's a
bedroom for San Francisco." The
shoot-out to them was "a crime of the
worst magnitude, defying our legal
system openly and blatently. What
more inflammatory incident to those
whose lives are untouched by racism
and oppression."
"The state doesn't have to mention
her politics. They're known. The state
relies on this kind of spectre in the
minds of the jury . . . The mere fact of
purchasing guns could result in an
inference in the mind of the jury that
she had some connection ... If she has
any connection with this kind of
outrageous conduct, off with her
head."
Conspiracy Implications
Under California law, anyone aiding
or abetting in a major crime is equally
guilty with the direct participants. The

conspiracy charge allows inferences to
be made with little evidence.
Melvin Kennedy, law student,
stated, "All they have to prove is an
agreement; the rules of evidence,
relevancy, admissability of evidence are
relaxed. Primarily in this century
conspiracy has been used as a political
weapon."
Law student Ed Hayes added,
"Under conspiracy prosecution only
has to show that at some point in her
life there was some connection
(between Jackson and her)."

"Her strength is the support that the
brothers and sisters give her and work
with other political prisoners."
They claimed Davis was beaten
during extradition from New York to
California. They also said a
prison-appointed urologist was sent to
treat her for a skin rash instead of a
dermatologist and that she was
confined in solitary while prison
officials refused to obey a court order
regarding visiting hours.
Her Own Counsel
At the next hearing on March 16,

her lawyers will request she be released
on bail, allowed to be her own counsel,
and will attempt to quash the
indictment because of "prejudicial
publicity by the media." After hearing,
there will be a people's hearing outside
the court to explain what happened
and to have the trial moved to a larger
court.
But the focus is not totally on Free
Angela! She has said, "I think it is
important to link up the sturggle for
my freedom with the fight to free other
Black political prisoners ... 1 will not
be free until all Black people are
free...
"Everybody participating must
realize I cannot be truly free as long as
there exists another political prisoner.
And in turn political prisoners will not
know freedom until the last starving
black child in Mississippi is assured
nourishment, clothing and shelter."
Many feel there is little hope for a
fair trial, but Brotsky advises, "People
must obliterate their preconceptions,
prejudices and racism through
discussions."
