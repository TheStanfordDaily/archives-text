"A Low Temperature Glimpse at the
Beginning and End of the Universe" is
the title of a talk to be given by Physics
Professor William Fairbank tonight at
8:00 in the Physics Lecture Hall.
Fairbank, a member of the physics
faculty since 1959, has been a leading
researcher in low temperature physics,
which studies the properties of matter
only a few degrees above absolute zero.
In each section of the talk describing
the creation, expansion, and end of the
universe, he will explain how different
experiments in his laboratories lend
support to his theories.
Fairbank's work has recently been
concentrated on applying what is
known about matter at low
temperatures to problems of general
interest to the whole of physics.
For example, the postulate which
states that physical laws must be
invariant whether time goes forward or
backwards has recently been called into
doubt for certain situations.
Theoretical physicists say that if an

clcctric dipole, where one end of a
particle is positive and the other
negative, can be observed on the helium
isotope, helium, that then this law has
been violated.
When you apply an electric field to
the helium 3 nucleus, an electric dipole
should appear. The reverse should
occur when the field is taken away—the
dipole should disappear.
Fairbank's graduate students hope
to find the residual dipole by first
cooling helium 3 to a low temperature
where it is liquid. Since helium 3 nuclei
are all little magnets on their own, at
this low temperature is should be
possible to line them all up in the same
direction.
If the electric dipoles exist they will
be lined up in the same direction as the
magnets on the nuclei. In this case it
would be possible to test for the dipole
very sensitively.
Whether time can go forwards
equally well as backwards, is just one
hypothesis being tested with the means
of low temperature physics.
