# Cranston Calls For End To Draft
## 
### TOM PAULU 
United States Senator Alan Cranston
stated that the U.S. should "do away
with selective service" at public
meeting at Gunn High School last
night.
Cranston also termed the invasion of
Laos "a gamble" on the part of the
President Nixon and stated his support
of a bill making the filibuster a less
effective Senate weapon. Cranston, a
Stanford graduate, declined to
comment on recent political activity
here, claiming he is "not acquainted"
with the current situation.
Over a dozen area residents, ranging
from a disabled Vietnam veteran to a
fifty-year-old ex-aerospace engineer
who claimed to have quit his job
because of its involvement in the war,

gave brief statements against the war,
on which the Democratic Senator from
California commented.
President Lyman, the first speaker,
said "only by setting ourselves a
definite target date for total withdrawal
from Southeast Asia—B-5 2's as well as
infantrymen—can we extricate
ourselves from this tragedy."
Addressing Cranston, he added:
"Speaking for myself, I find it deeply
disturbing that the response of the
Congress to the Laotian adventure has
been so muted."
Cranston said that he doesn't believe
enough Senators share his opposition to
the draft to defeat a bill extending it in
June, but he believes that a two-year
extention, and not the four year

extention advocated by President
Nixon, will be approved. He said that
he will press for an amendment bearing
the provision that no one may be sent
to an undeclared war without his own
consent to be tacked on to the
extention bill if it appears certain that
the bill itself cannot be stopped.
The chiefly middle-aged audience
applauded Cranston enthusiastically as
he told them that he fears Nixon has
"succumbed to the illusion that a
military victory can be won" in
Southeast Asia. He also said that
anything less than a total withdrawal of
U.S. troops weakens our position,
making more likely a future use of
nuclear bombs or a "Dunkirk
withdrawal."

In a response to the accusation made
by Banning Garrett, Asian editor of
Ramparts magazine, that the long term
plan of the U.S. was to exploit
Southeast Asia economically, Cranston
said that "economic matters don't have
much to do with Vietnam."
Cranston expressed his viewpoint
that if the United States had left
Vietnam to determine its own fate, it
would have adopted an "independent,
Tito-type Communism," but that now
it will probably become a close ally of
Red China if we withdraw.
Although declining to comment on
the specific violence that has occurred
at Stanford, Cranston stated that he
doesn't believe disruption "serves the
cause of peace."
Stanford freshman Peter Knutson,
chairman of the Stanford Draft Repeal
Movement, who was the "only one of
the 12 million draft age men" to testify
against the draft before the Senate
Armed Services Committee, told those
at the meeting that "any country not
worth defending will not be defended
by its people."
