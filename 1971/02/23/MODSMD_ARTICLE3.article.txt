# Venceremos: Action, Not Theory
## University Complicity Attacked 
### ED KOHN 
This is the second in a series of news analyses describing
political activism - both on the Right and on the Left.
"The vanguard of the revolution in this country will be
the most oppressed peoples of this country — that's the
black, brown, and Native American peoples. In the
revolution, societal roles are turned upside down; that is,
the most oppressed take the roles of leadership," a member
of Venceremos said.
Members of the group say that they are not trying to
build a movement around student power here but are
trying to expose the "fascism of the Stanford Judicial
Council and that kind of American justice" and how that
relates to the cases of Angela Davis, Bobby S"ale and the
Panthers.
At least four of those recently tried for disrupting Henry
Cabot Lodge's speech Jan. 11 are members of Venceremos.
"To be suspended from school is not that big a deal when
you look at the struggles of Bobby Seale, Angela Davis,
Ruehell McGhee, the Soledad Brothers," one member said.
"In all things, we follow the leadership of the Black
Panther Party. The Black Panther Party believes in armed
self-defense: every member of that party and our party
should be armed and own a gun for self-defense . . . Our
revolutionary business is serving the people."
Stanford's Hole
Venceremos believes that Stanford is one of the primary
institutions supporting the continuing Indochinese War,

and that the only way to end that "complicity'' is to "shut
it (the University) down."
"Stanford plays a very important part in the
capitalist-imperialist system right now in that the petit
bourgeois people here are trained to go out to business as
managers. It's very important for capitalism that the
colleges continue to exist. Stanford is a very important tool
of the imperialists . . .
"For us to be here educating people on what's
happening and how they're being used and how they're
perpetuating a racist system is very important work. It's
not as impossible as you would think off-hand that sons
and daughters of the ruling class will become
revolutionaries when they have everything they want.
Polarization
"You don't have that much freedom, you just have
money. But in this country, freedom is money as is
happiness, justice, pleasure — everything."
Venceremos considers itself a Marxist-Leninist group,
and many of its most outspoken members, including Prof.
Franklin, consider themselves Maoists. At rallies, one
common theme stressed by members is that "one side's
right, one side's wrong" and that "liberals" or "moderates"
are dangerous because of their refusal to choose up sides:
"Sometimes I feel that liberals are more dangerous than
conservatives because liberals don't actually know what's
happening with the world. Conservatives know who's in
power, and they'll do anything to keep themselves in
power, and liberals feel that the country is very fair to
everyone. Thai's unobjeetive reality, totally unrealistic."

BOMB THREAT—Stanford firemen came to the Main Library at 11:3 5 a.m. yesterday for what turned out to be a false
bomb threat. The bomb was a fake Molotov cocktain made with a liquid which turned out to be nonflammable. Found
in the bushes a note attached to the bottle warned, "Danger — John Keilch Must Keep His Job."
