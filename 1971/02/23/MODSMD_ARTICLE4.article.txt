# BSU Issues New Set Of Demands; Lyman To Respond At Meeting
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The Black Students Union Central
Committee, on the eve of a meeting
with President Lyman, yesterday
released 21 demands of the University.
An accompanying statement said that
they are "demands that Black Students
will seriously pursue until they are
strictly enforced by the Stanford
Administration."
The statement, written by BSU
Co-chairman Willie L. Newberry, began,
"If not being called nigger was the
major concern of most Stanford Blacks,
we would have little to worry about.
However, our concerns are more
fundamental.
"They have to do with increasing
the number of Black students and
workers that have access to Stanford's
resources and facilities. They have to
do with evaluating and restructuring
Stanford's corporate policy relations to
Black people both internally and
externally."
Lyman will respond at a special BSU
meeting today at 1 :30 p.m. Newberry
urged all black students, faculty,
workers and administrators to attend.
