# Statement Of Faculty Political Action Group
## 
### 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. Knowledge is the product of
centuries of man's experiences,
work and thought. It is the
heritage of all people.
2. The social utility of
knowledge is: a) to permit man to
understand himself and his
surroundings and b) to enable
man to better his life and those of
others.
3. Knowledge, in that sense, is
not a private possession of those
who have attained it. The
responsibility of those who deal
with knowledge transcends the
creation and refinement of
knowledge; it includes also the
transmission of knowledge to all
who wish and need it.
4. Because knowledge is a
distillate of experience and

perception, it cannot thrive or
develop in isolation from the
society from which it is derived.
In general, those who seek to
develop knowledge relate it to the
specific experiences of man.
Furthermore, teachers who are
good at transmitting knowledge to
others are usually sufficiently
close to them to perceive their
problems and needs. These
teachers understand the purposes
to which knowledge will be used
and therefore to which it must
pertain. Their own understanding
of knowledge is deepened and
enlarged by the interaction with
the learner.
5. Political and social
democracy require access of all
citizens to knowledge lest it
become the basis for power and
privilege of a few. Particularly
when technological knowledge
changes rapidly and new
experiences are being gained
continuously, all citizens, not just
youth, need continuous access to
knowledge as it develops
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE IDEAL UNIVERSITY
1. The university is the site for
learning of the known, creation of
new knowledge, and contributions
to the improvement of the general
welfare. Its interests concern

whatever influences or emanates
from man. Its studies range from
the most abstract to the very
practical. It perceives scholarly
inquiry and research as essential
to the education of both the
teacher and the student. It strives
to make its knowledge available to
all who want it. The university is
an innovative force and
instrument for social change
through the education it imparts,
the subjects it chooses to research,
and the products of that research.
2. As the site where the young
with their aspirations, the
cumulative knowledge of
mankind, and the exploration of
the unknown all converge, a
university is a place of ferment.
Refinement and change of both
thought and practice are its
currency. Perhaps as much as any
other social institution it
cultivates change. The ideal
university organizes itself to
facilitate the emergence and
examination of the new, not only
in external subject matter but also
in its own internal structure and
practices. Thereby, as an
institution, it exemplifies its
intellectual values.
3. The desired relationship
between students and faculty is
that of partnership. Though they
usually differ in age and

experience, the differences are less
than the similarities — shared
experiences of the moment,
search for understanding, and
participation in the emergence of
the new. In the ideal
teaching-learning relationship,
each participant is both learner
and teacher. The structure and
function of the university should
reflect this mutual dependence.
4. It is the responsibility of the
university to contribute to
society's knowledge and
understanding. Society provides
the university with material
support and with the academic
freedom which is necessary for
the faculty and students to pursue
knowledge wherever it may lead.
Academic freedom assures
society's right to learn. At times
this contract is challenged by
those outside the university who
no longer wish to hear the new or
the critical, or by those inside the
university who wish to isolate
themselves from surrounding
society. The contract between the
university and its parent society is
a political contract. The ideal
university strives to strengthen
and defend that contract by
changing and improving itself, and
by persuading new generations of
citizens of the value of the
contract.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
In recent years, universities,
including Stanford, have
significantly failed to exemplify
these ideals.
1. Despite their oft-proclaimed
neutrality they have exhibited a
striking partisanship. Curricula in
the past have omitted study and
teaching of such important areas
as: the history, culture and
movements of minority, worker
and farmer groups; social bases of
urban development, decay and
renovation; environmental biology
and preservation; racism and its
impact on political and economic
democracy; social implications of
technological development;
international economics as it
relates to national independence,
national liberation, and the
exploitative relationship between
developed and underdeveloped
countries; strategies of
development of peace-time
economies. Research programs
have been conditioned as much by
available funds as by the
importance of subjects. Highly
selective admission policies have
favored the well-to-do white and
resulted in socially
unrepresentative student bodies.
Governing boards have been
unrepresentative of society at
large as well as of the university
community.
2. By denying institutional
social responsibility, by studying
and teaching only selected aspects
of man's relationship to man and
his social development, and by
developing projects which secure
available research funds rather
than assuring a full breadth of
research programs, universities
have been increasingly associated
with particular policies of
government, especially with

foreign intervention and war.
Thereby universities have
contributed to the exploitation of
some by others and to the neglect
of pressing social needs. The
dispassionate pursuit of
understanding and truth have
receded in favor of acceptance of
prevailing political concepts and
sources of funds.
3. As universities have pursued
socially partisan roles, they have
become more and more isolated
from their surrounding
communities. This is exemplified
at Stanford, which has for some
time served a "national
constituency." In doing so, it has
denied many capable youth from
mid-California access to its
facilities. Its research projects,
which provide important financial
support for the university, neglect
the problems and needs of
mid-California. The academic
interests of its teachers, and hence
its curriculum, do not reflect
sufficiently broad social concern.
Consequently, as Stanford has
grown in national prestige in the
last 20 years, it has become
simultaneously more and more
isolated politically, educationally,
and financially from its immediate
community, neither serving it nor
supported by it.
4. Nowhere have university
failures been more apparent than
in relation to the war in Vietnam.
The universities have been
significant contributors to the war
through direct and indirect
military research. They have
established and maintained
scholarly programs which
encompass covert projects of
military and political intervention
in Vietnam and other countries.
Faculty and trustees have been
both advisors to the war effort

and financial beneficiaries of it.
These actions have associated the
university with the degradation of
the nation's political and moral
integrity resulting from
prosecution of the war, and have
exposed the universities' most
partisan nature.
When many students and some
faculty protested, the universities
first denied their responsibility
and then sought to punish the
protestors. Politicians fanned the
flames of enmity for personal
political benefit. Police, militia,
and gas were deployed. Then
students were killed. Now mutual
violence has supervened, further
threatening political liberties,
academic freedom, and the
university functions.
Protestors have been accused
of politicizing the university. Yet
participation in military research
and war projects is in itself a
politicization of the university at
least as substantial as protests
against the war.
5. Many students, perceptive of
the gulf between proclaimed
university goals and actual
performance, have become cynical
and hostile. Some faculty,
identifying themselves with
current university policies, have
become defensive and rigid.
Others, recognizing their own
interests, remain uninvolved.
University administrations have
tended to adopt both denial and
repression as the institutional
response to challenge by students
and faculty. In many ways,
challenge itself has been
considered subversion and the
challengers, whether student,
faculty, or citizen, have become
enemies. As a result, universities
often drift, divided and beset by
quarrelling

often drift, divided and beset by
quarrelling
GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. Knowledge is the product of
centuries of man's experiences,
work and thought. It is the
heritage of all people.
2. The social utility of
knowledge is: a) to permit man to
understand himself and his
surroundings and b) to enable
man to better his life and those of
others.
3. Knowledge, in that sense, is
not a private possession of those
who have attained it. The
responsibility of those who deal
with knowledge transcends the
creation and refinement of
knowledge; it includes also the
transmission of knowledge to all
who wish and need it.
4. Because knowledge is a
distillate of experience and

perception, it cannot thrive or
develop in isolation from the
society from which it is derived.
In general, those who seek to
develop knowledge relate it to the
specific experiences of man.
Furthermore, teachers who are
good at transmitting knowledge to
others are usually sufficiently
close to them to perceive their
problems and needs. These
teachers understand the purposes
to which knowledge will be used
and therefore to which it must
pertain. Their own understanding
of knowledge is deepened and
enlarged by the interaction with
the learner.
5. Political and social
democracy require access of all
citizens to knowledge lest it
become the basis for power and
privilege of a few. Particularly
when technological knowledge
changes rapidly and new
experiences are being gained
continuously, all citizens, not just
youth, need continuous access to
knowledge as it develops
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE IDEAL UNIVERSITY
1. The university is the site for
learning of the known, creation of
new knowledge, and contributions
to the improvement of the general
welfare. Its interests concern

whatever influences or emanates
from man. Its studies range from
the most abstract to the very
practical. It perceives scholarly
inquiry and research as essential
to the education of both the
teacher and the student. It strives
to make its knowledge available to
all who want it. The university is
an innovative force and
instrument for social change
through the education it imparts,
the subjects it chooses to research,
and the products of that research.
2. As the site where the young
with their aspirations, the
cumulative knowledge of
mankind, and the exploration of
the unknown all converge, a
university is a place of ferment.
Refinement and change of both
thought and practice are its
currency. Perhaps as much as any
other social institution it
cultivates change. The ideal
university organizes itself to
facilitate the emergence and
examination of the new, not only
in external subject matter but also
in its own internal structure and
practices. Thereby, as an
institution, it exemplifies its
intellectual values.
3. The desired relationship
between students and faculty is
that of partnership. Though they
usually differ in age and

experience, the differences are less
than the similarities — shared
experiences of the moment,
search for understanding, and
participation in the emergence of
the new. In the ideal
teaching-learning relationship,
each participant is both learner
and teacher. The structure and
function of the university should
reflect this mutual dependence.
4. It is the responsibility of the
university to contribute to
society's knowledge and
understanding. Society provides
the university with material
support and with the academic
freedom which is necessary for
the faculty and students to pursue
knowledge wherever it may lead.
Academic freedom assures
society's right to learn. At times
this contract is challenged by
those outside the university who
no longer wish to hear the new or
the critical, or by those inside the
university who wish to isolate
themselves from surrounding
society. The contract between the
university and its parent society is
a political contract. The ideal
university strives to strengthen
and defend that contract by
changing and improving itself, and
by persuading new generations of
citizens of the value of the
contract.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
In recent years, universities,
including Stanford, have
significantly failed to exemplify
these ideals.
1. Despite their oft-proclaimed
neutrality they have exhibited a
striking partisanship. Curricula in
the past have omitted study and
teaching of such important areas
as: the history, culture and
movements of minority, worker
and farmer groups; social bases of
urban development, decay and
renovation; environmental biology
and preservation; racism and its
impact on political and economic
democracy; social implications of
technological development;
international economics as it
relates to national independence,
national liberation, and the
exploitative relationship between
developed and underdeveloped
countries; strategies of
development of peace-time
economies. Research programs
have been conditioned as much by
available funds as by the
importance of subjects. Highly
selective admission policies have
favored the well-to-do white and
resulted in socially
unrepresentative student bodies.
Governing boards have been
unrepresentative of society at
large as well as of the university
community.
2. By denying institutional
social responsibility, by studying
and teaching only selected aspects
of man's relationship to man and
his social development, and by
developing projects which secure
available research funds rather
than assuring a full breadth of
research programs, universities
have been increasingly associated
with particular policies of
government, especially with

foreign intervention and war.
Thereby universities have
contributed to the exploitation of
some by others and to the neglect
of pressing social needs. The
dispassionate pursuit of
understanding and truth have
receded in favor of acceptance of
prevailing political concepts and
sources of funds.
3. As universities have pursued
socially partisan roles, they have
become more and more isolated
from their surrounding
communities. This is exemplified
at Stanford, which has for some
time served a "national
constituency." In doing so, it has
denied many capable youth from
mid-California access to its
facilities. Its research projects,
which provide important financial
support for the university, neglect
the problems and needs of
mid-California. The academic
interests of its teachers, and hence
its curriculum, do not reflect
sufficiently broad social concern.
Consequently, as Stanford has
grown in national prestige in the
last 20 years, it has become
simultaneously more and more
isolated politically, educationally,
and financially from its immediate
community, neither serving it nor
supported by it.
4. Nowhere have university
failures been more apparent than
in relation to the war in Vietnam.
The universities have been
significant contributors to the war
through direct and indirect
military research. They have
established and maintained
scholarly programs which
encompass covert projects of
military and political intervention
in Vietnam and other countries.
Faculty and trustees have been
both advisors to the war effort

and financial beneficiaries of it.
These actions have associated the
university with the degradation of
the nation's political and moral
integrity resulting from
prosecution of the war, and have
exposed the universities' most
partisan nature.
When many students and some
faculty protested, the universities
first denied their responsibility
and then sought to punish the
protestors. Politicians fanned the
flames of enmity for personal
political benefit. Police, militia,
and gas were deployed. Then
students were killed. Now mutual
violence has supervened, further
threatening political liberties,
academic freedom, and the
university functions.
Protestors have been accused
of politicizing the university. Yet
participation in military research
and war projects is in itself a
politicization of the university at
least as substantial as protests
against the war.
5. Many students, perceptive of
the gulf between proclaimed
university goals and actual
performance, have become cynical
and hostile. Some faculty,
identifying themselves with
current university policies, have
become defensive and rigid.
Others, recognizing their own
interests, remain uninvolved.
University administrations have
tended to adopt both denial and
repression as the institutional
response to challenge by students
and faculty. In many ways,

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. Knowledge is the product of
centuries of man's experiences,
work and thought. It is the
heritage of all people.
2. The social utility of
knowledge is: a) to permit man to
understand himself and his
surroundings and b) to enable
man to better his life and those of
others.
3. Knowledge, in that sense, is
not a private possession of those
who have attained it. The
responsibility of those who deal
with knowledge transcends the
creation and refinement of
knowledge; it includes also the
transmission of knowledge to all
who wish and need it.
4. Because knowledge is a
distillate of experience and

perception, it cannot thrive or
develop in isolation from the
society from which it is derived.
In general, those who seek to
develop knowledge relate it to the
specific experiences of man.
Furthermore, teachers who are
good at transmitting knowledge to
others are usually sufficiently
close to them to perceive their
problems and needs. These
teachers understand the purposes
to which knowledge will be used
and therefore to which it must
pertain. Their own understanding
of knowledge is deepened and
enlarged by the interaction with
the learner.
5. Political and social
democracy require access of all
citizens to knowledge lest it
become the basis for power and
privilege of a few. Particularly
when technological knowledge
changes rapidly and new
experiences are being gained
continuously, all citizens, not just
youth, need continuous access to
knowledge as it develops
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE IDEAL UNIVERSITY
1. The university is the site for
learning of the known, creation of
new knowledge, and contributions
to the improvement of the general
welfare. Its interests concern

whatever influences or emanates
from man. Its studies range from
the most abstract to the very
practical. It perceives scholarly
inquiry and research as essential
to the education of both the
teacher and the student. It strives
to make its knowledge available to
all who want it. The university is
an innovative force and
instrument for social change
through the education it imparts,
the subjects it chooses to research,
and the products of that research.
2. As the site where the young
with their aspirations, the
cumulative knowledge of
mankind, and the exploration of
the unknown all converge, a
university is a place of ferment.
Refinement and change of both
thought and practice are its
currency. Perhaps as much as any
other social institution it
cultivates change. The ideal
university organizes itself to
facilitate the emergence and
examination of the new, not only
in external subject matter but also
in its own internal structure and
practices. Thereby, as an
institution, it exemplifies its
intellectual values.
3. The desired relationship
between students and faculty is
that of partnership. Though they
usually differ in age and

experience, the differences are less
than the similarities — shared
experiences of the moment,
search for understanding, and
participation in the emergence of
the new. In the ideal
teaching-learning relationship,
each participant is both learner
and teacher. The structure and
function of the university should
reflect this mutual dependence.
4. It is the responsibility of the
university to contribute to
society's knowledge and
understanding. Society provides
the university with material
support and with the academic
freedom which is necessary for
the faculty and students to pursue
knowledge wherever it may lead.
Academic freedom assures
society's right to learn. At times
this contract is challenged by
those outside the university who
no longer wish to hear the new or
the critical, or by those inside the
university who wish to isolate
themselves from surrounding
society. The contract between the
university and its parent society is
a political contract. The ideal
university strives to strengthen
and defend that contract by
changing and improving itself, and
by persuading new generations of
citizens of the value of the
contract.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
In recent years, universities,
including Stanford, have
significantly failed to exemplify
these ideals.
1. Despite their oft-proclaimed
neutrality they have exhibited a
striking partisanship. Curricula in
the past have omitted study and
teaching of such important areas
as: the history, culture and
movements of minority, worker
and farmer groups; social bases of
urban development, decay and
renovation; environmental biology
and preservation; racism and its
impact on political and economic
democracy; social implications of
technological development;
international economics as it
relates to national independence,
national liberation, and the
exploitative relationship between
developed and underdeveloped
countries; strategies of
development of peace-time
economies. Research programs
have been conditioned as much by
available funds as by the
importance of subjects. Highly
selective admission policies have
favored the well-to-do white and
resulted in socially
unrepresentative student bodies.
Governing boards have been
unrepresentative of society at
large as well as of the university
community.
2. By denying institutional
social responsibility, by studying
and teaching only selected aspects
of man's relationship to man and
his social development, and by
developing projects which secure
available research funds rather
than assuring a full breadth of
research programs, universities
have been increasingly associated
with particular policies of
government, especially with

foreign intervention and war.
Thereby universities have
contributed to the exploitation of
some by others and to the neglect
of pressing social needs. The
dispassionate pursuit of
understanding and truth have
receded in favor of acceptance of
prevailing political concepts and
sources of funds.
3. As universities have pursued
socially partisan roles, they have
become more and more isolated
from their surrounding
communities. This is exemplified
at Stanford, which has for some
time served a "national
constituency." In doing so, it has
denied many capable youth from
mid-California access to its
facilities. Its research projects,
which provide important financial
support for the university, neglect
the problems and needs of
mid-California. The academic
interests of its teachers, and hence
its curriculum, do not reflect
sufficiently broad social concern.
Consequently, as Stanford has
grown in national prestige in the
last 20 years, it has become
simultaneously more and more
isolated politically, educationally,
and financially from its immediate
community, neither serving it nor
supported by it.
4. Nowhere have university
failures been more apparent than
in relation to the war in Vietnam.
The universities have been
significant contributors to the war
through direct and indirect
military research. They have
established and maintained
scholarly programs which
encompass covert projects of
military and political intervention
in Vietnam and other countries.
Faculty and trustees have been
both advisors to the war effort

and financial beneficiaries of it.
These actions have associated the
university with the degradation of
the nation's political and moral
integrity resulting from
prosecution of the war, and have
exposed the universities' most
partisan nature.
When many students and some
faculty protested, the universities
first denied their responsibility
and then sought to punish the
protestors. Politicians fanned the
flames of enmity for personal
political benefit. Police, militia,
and gas were deployed. Then
students were killed. Now mutual
violence has supervened, further
threatening political liberties,
academic freedom, and the
university functions.
Protestors have been accused
of politicizing the university. Yet
participation in military research
and war projects is in itself a
politicization of the university at
least as substantial as protests
against the war.

the gulf between proclaimed

GENERAL PRINCIPLES
1. Knowledge is the product of
centuries of man's experiences,
work and thought. It is the
heritage of all people.
2. The social utility of
knowledge is: a) to permit man to
understand himself and his
surroundings and b) to enable
man to better his life and those of
others.
3. Knowledge, in that sense, is
not a private possession of those
who have attained it. The
responsibility of those who deal
with knowledge transcends the
creation and refinement of
knowledge; it includes also the
transmission of knowledge to all
who wish and need it.
4. Because knowledge is a
distillate of experience and

perception, it cannot thrive or
develop in isolation from the
society from which it is derived.
In general, those who seek to
develop knowledge relate it to the
specific experiences of man.
Furthermore, teachers who are
good at transmitting knowledge to
others are usually sufficiently
close to them to perceive their
problems and needs. These
teachers understand the purposes
to which knowledge will be used
and therefore to which it must
pertain. Their own understanding
of knowledge is deepened and
enlarged by the interaction with
the learner.
5. Political and social
democracy require access of all
citizens to knowledge lest it
become the basis for power and
privilege of a few. Particularly
when technological knowledge
changes rapidly and new
experiences are being gained
continuously, all citizens, not just
youth, need continuous access to
knowledge as it develops
CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS
OF THE IDEAL UNIVERSITY
1. The university is the site for
learning of the known, creation of
new knowledge, and contributions
to the improvement of the general
welfare. Its interests concern

whatever influences or emanates
from man. Its studies range from
the most abstract to the very
practical. It perceives scholarly
inquiry and research as essential
to the education of both the
teacher and the student. It strives
to make its knowledge available to
all who want it. The university is
an innovative force and
instrument for social change
through the education it imparts,
the subjects it chooses to research,
and the products of that research.
2. As the site where the young
with their aspirations, the
cumulative knowledge of
mankind, and the exploration of
the unknown all converge, a
university is a place of ferment.
Refinement and change of both
thought and practice are its
currency. Perhaps as much as any
other social institution it
cultivates change. The ideal
university organizes itself to
facilitate the emergence and
examination of the new, not only
in external subject matter but also
in its own internal structure and
practices. Thereby, as an
institution, it exemplifies its
intellectual values.
3. The desired relationship
between students and faculty is
that of partnership. Though they
usually differ in age and

experience, the differences are less
than the similarities — shared
experiences of the moment,
search for understanding, and
participation in the emergence of
the new. In the ideal
teaching-learning relationship,
each participant is both learner
and teacher. The structure and
function of the university should
reflect this mutual dependence.
4. It is the responsibility of the
university to contribute to
society's knowledge and
understanding. Society provides
the university with material
support and with the academic
freedom which is necessary for
the faculty and students to pursue
knowledge wherever it may lead.
Academic freedom assures
society's right to learn. At times
this contract is challenged by
those outside the university who
no longer wish to hear the new or
the critical, or by those inside the
university who wish to isolate
themselves from surrounding
society. The contract between the
university and its parent society is
a political contract. The ideal
university strives to strengthen
and defend that contract by
changing and improving itself, and
by persuading new generations of
citizens of the value of the
contract.

CURRENT PROBLEMS
In recent years, universities,
including Stanford, have
significantly failed to exemplify
these ideals.
1. Despite their oft-proclaimed
neutrality they have exhibited a
striking partisanship. Curricula in
the past have omitted study and
teaching of such important areas
as: the history, culture and
movements of minority, worker
and farmer groups; social bases of
urban development, decay and
renovation; environmental biology
and preservation; racism and its
impact on political and economic
democracy; social implications of
technological development;
international economics as it
relates to national independence,
national liberation, and the
exploitative relationship between
developed and underdeveloped
countries; strategies of
development of peace-time
economies. Research programs
have been conditioned as much by
available funds as by the
importance of subjects. Highly
selective admission policies have
favored the well-to-do white and
resulted in socially
unrepresentative student bodies.
Governing boards have been
unrepresentative of society at
large as well as of the university
community.
2. By denying institutional
social responsibility, by studying
and teaching only selected aspects
of man's relationship to man and
his social development, and by
developing projects which secure
available research funds rather
than assuring a full breadth of
research programs, universities
have been increasingly associated
with particular policies of
government, especially with

foreign intervention and war.
Thereby universities have
contributed to the exploitation of
some by others and to the neglect
of pressing social needs. The
dispassionate pursuit of
understanding and truth have
receded in favor of acceptance of
prevailing political concepts and
sources of funds.
3. As universities have pursued
socially partisan roles, they have
become more and more isolated
from their surrounding
communities. This is exemplified
at Stanford, which has for some
time served a "national
constituency." In doing so, it has
denied many capable youth from
mid-California access to its
facilities. Its research projects,
which provide important financial
support for the university, neglect
the problems and needs of
mid-California. The academic
interests of its teachers, and hence
its curriculum, do not reflect
sufficiently broad social concern.
Consequently, as Stanford has
grown in national prestige in the
last 20 years, it has become
simultaneously more and more
isolated politically, educationally,
and financially from its immediate
community, neither serving it nor
supported by it.
4. Nowhere have university
failures been more apparent than
in relation to the war in Vietnam.
The universities have been
significant contributors to the war
through direct and indirect
military research. They have
established and maintained
scholarly programs which
encompass covert projects of
military and political intervention
in Vietnam and other countries.
Faculty and trustees have been
both advisors to the war effort

and financial beneficiaries of it.
These actions have associated the
university with the degradation of
the nation's political and moral
integrity resulting from
prosecution of the war, and have
exposed the universities' most
partisan nature.
When many students and some
faculty protested, the universities
first denied their responsibility
and then sought to punish the
protestors. Politicians fanned the
flames of enmity for personal
political benefit. Police, militia,
and gas were deployed. Then
students were killed. Now mutual
violence has supervened, further
threatening political liberties,
academic freedom, and the
university functions.
Protestors have been accused
of politicizing the university. Yet
participation in military research
and war projects is in itself a
politicization of the university at
least as substantial as protests
against the war.
5. Many students, perceptive of
the gulf between proclaimed
university goals and actual
performance, have become cynical
and hostile. Some faculty,
identifying themselves with
current university policies, have
become defensive and rigid.
Others, recognizing their own
interests, remain uninvolved.
University administrations have
tended to adopt both denial and
repression as the institutional
response to challenge by students
and faculty. In many ways,
challenge itself has been
considered subversion and the
challengers, whether student,
faculty, or citizen, have become
enemies. As a result, universities
often drift, divided and beset by
quarrelling
