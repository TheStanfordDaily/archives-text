## Bay Area Bicyclists Awake! 
### 
theo wierdsma

During the past few years an increasing number
of M.D.'s have rediscovered the healthy influence
which bicycle riding can have on the human body,
as well as on the human spirit. A survey, conducted
to expose the nation's most popular outdoor
activities for persons 12 years of age and older,
as published in Statistical Abstracts of the United
States - 1970, shows us that bicycling ranks number
10 in the country. This is higher than i.e. hunting
(13), camping (15), horseback riding (17), snow
skiing (21), and sailing (23). When we consider that
approximately 1% of America's population lives
between North San Francisco and South San Jose,
and when we incorporate California's favorable
climate, we can safely assume that a large
percentage of these occasional and regular bicyclists
live in the Bay Area.
This is encouraging, and at the same time
remarkable. Encouraging, because bicycling
rejuvenates the body, relaxes the mind, decreases
the congestion on our highways helps to fight
pollution, and keeps people fit with a minimum of
effort. It is remarkable, because there are very few
facilities available, outside of Golden Gate Park,
where bicyclists can use their vehicles safely. Those
who intend to make their bike a regular means of
transportation to and from work or school, become

speedily discouraged by the dangers they are
exposed to on the highways.
As a former inhabitant of the Netherlands, I
have come to regard the extensive network of
bicycle paths alongisde that country's highways very
highly. Since I moved to California, I have regularly
commuted between Mountain View and Stanford
both by bike and on foot. And on one occasion I
made a round trip stroll to San Francisco. For these
reasons I feel confident in talking about this
situation.
It is my opinion that a bicycle path, running
from San Jose to San Francisco, parallel to El
Camino, would be of great benefit to the entire Bay
Area community. Such a facility would induce more
people to use their bike on a regular basis, to stay
fit, and to relax. It would provide safety for
motorists as well as bicyclists. It would help fight
pollution, and decrease the congestion on highways
and parking areas.
Although study takes up almost all of my time, I
find this suggestion important enough to be
followed up. I would therefore like to invite
everybody who has any thoughts at all on this
subject to contact me. Maybe together we can
build on this idea, and arrive at some constructive
suggestions and proposals for the appropiate author
ities. (Theo Wierdsma is a junior in Political Science.)

where bicyclists can use their vehicles safely. Those
who intend to make their bike a regular means of
transportation to and from work or school, become

speedily discouraged by the dangers they are
exposed to on the highways.
As a former inhabitant of the Netherlands, I
have come to regard the extensive network of
bicycle paths alongisde that country's highways very
highly. Since I moved to California, I have regularly
commuted between Mountain View and Stanford
both by bike and on foot. And on one occasion I
made a round trip stroll to San Francisco. For these
reasons I feel confident in talking about this
situation.
It is my opinion that a bicycle path, running
from San Jose to San Francisco, parallel to El
Camino, would be of great benefit to the entire Bay
Area community. Such a facility would induce more
people to use their bike on a regular basis, to stay
fit, and to relax. It would provide safety for
motorists as well as bicyclists. It would help fight
pollution, and decrease the congestion on highways
and parking areas.
Although study takes up almost all of my time, I
find this suggestion important enough to be
followed up. I would therefore like to invite
everybody who has any thoughts at all on this
subject to contact me. Maybe together we can
build on this idea, and arrive at some constructive
suggestions and proposals for the appropiate author
ities. (Theo Wierdsma is a junior in Political Science.)
