# Advertisers Solicit Campus Consumers

"Frank Miller, We want you!
We want you so much we've put
together this special Frank Miller
'We Care' Package with a beautiful
personal transistor radio, and your
choice of up to $81.76 worth of
new records — for only $2.8 6
Why does the Columbia
Record Club "care" about Frank?
Besides being a swell fellow and
fun at parties, Frank Miller is a
member of an extremely lucrative
market for direct mail. He is an
American college student.
The college market, part of a
youth market which represents
over one-half of the buying
population, is an especially
attractive group for firms
representing luxury or specialty
lines like cosmetics and fast foods,
as well as the recreational markets
like magazines, books and record
clubs.
Gary Williams, of Wank,
Williams, Neylan, Inc., local
marketing counselors attributes
this fact to two forces. College

people in general have a high
percentage of their income
available for disposable purposes.
Free from family obligations, they
have many more options on which
to spend their loose change —
change that climbs into the
millions yearly.
Low Return Rate
For example, the direct mail
approach, in spite of its elaborate
mailings, contests, and teasers,
requires only 2-5% rate of return
on a mass mailing (5 00,000 or
more "Frank Miller We want
you!" letters) to be successful.
Mrs. Dee Tozar, of the Dee
Tozar consulting firm notes that it
is this mass mailing, usually at
third class rates, but sometimes
even first class, which gives the
advertiser the most accurate way
to pinpoint marketing
effectiveness. This is because each
piece of mail is coded to tell the
seller from which batch of
mailings the customer is coming
from. On Frank's invitation, this
number appears as "Reservation
No. 822-9."

The susceptibility of college
students the chance that they
ignore letters or advertisements in
campus publications — is a matter
of controversy among local
boppo-socko marketing
counselors.
Students Less Gullible
Andy Markem of the Hal
Lawrence firm, feels that college
people are less susceptible than
their elders. Furthermore, he
believes that their lack of
gullibility has been making
national advertisers more sensitive
to minority groups; advertising is
getting away from "its
WASPishness."
Kurt Pauls of Vic Befera and
Associates thinks that the average
collegian is not any more ad-wary
but just requires a different
approach. This is especially true in
the case of prospective employers
recruiting seniors, he thinks. What
appears in the campus press is not
the same as what appears in a city
paper, even though it may be for
the same position.

Mrs. Tozar counters that the
success of firms in the student
market speaks for itself in terms
of profits available on campus.
'Right On' Ads
Williams thinks that students
are less susceptible to advertising,
but if, as he put it, the message is
"right on," in terms of both price
and quality, college people will
subscribe to the service.
Finally, Marken adds that
advertising is concerned about the
total campus environment. In an
effort to appeal to the college
market, an advertiser has to level
with his customer, be specific
about the value of his service, and
try to make his service appeal to
the best interests of the customer.
As long as this pressure from
the college market remains strong
— as well as lucrative — the
influence of new values by college
consumers will have a potent
impact on the American
marketing economy.
