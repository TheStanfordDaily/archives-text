The International Center will

costume. A wiener schnitzel
dinner will be served at 7 p.m. for
$1.25, followed by the traditional
Viennese dessert, krapfen.
Later in the evening, members
of the Ensemble International will
perform a short* program of
Austrian dances, including the
favorite schuhplattler laendler
from the Tirol. The Ensemble
International has performed

dances from many countries and

Fasching festivities are the
traditional Catholic celebrations
just before Lent, but in fact the
festival originated in pagan times
when it constituted a celebration
of the end of winter. Grotesque
masks and costumes are often
worn, although in Vienna the
emphasis is on the dance.
Tickets are available at the
I-Center (51.25 for the dinner).
