# Cleaver Wants Revolt, No Drugs
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Eldridge Cleaver encouraged
American youth to drop drugs and start
the revolution in a video-tape which
will be telecast on KQED tonight at
10 :00 p.m.
While discussing the drug culture
and the American revolution with
fellow fugitive Dr. Timothy Leary and
Dr. Michael Kannas, the clinical
psychologist for Los Angeles County,
Cleaver told American youth to stop
clowning with drugs and start
"Weathermaning and Panthering."
The discussion was taped February
12 th in Cleaver's Algerian apartment by
Glen Angell, who currently works for
Hocus Focus in San Francisco.
Cleaver expressed his concern with
youth who reject the status quo.
"My concern is with a great mass of
people, hundreds of thousands, maybe
millions. Fifty percent of Americans
are under 25 —and they're rejecting the
status quo.
Not Helping Us
"I have a negative attitude not to
the psychedelic lifestyle but to a
certain aspect" of hallucinatory drug
use. Cleaver said, "They're not really
helping us. Coming to our rallies,
wearing buttons, hanging posters on
their walls—that's not where it
stops... It has to be moved against."
The fugitive Black Panther said
revolutionaries aren't people "walking
around with long hair" reflecting the

revolution "merely by donning the
guise of the youth culture.
"Physically destroying the apparatus
of oppression is what's called for,"
Cleaver said.
Dr. Kannis reiterated Cleaver's thesis
by saying "the future will be what our
youth will be."
Addressing his two campanions in
the modest flat, Kannas told Cleaver
and Leary, "You guys are inspirational
to youth in the U.S. People identify
with you and you must be clear on
your drug position."
Clarity Sought
Leary struggled with the problem of
clarity during the entire 5 7-minute
taping. After Cleaver charged that the
abuse of LSD was an escape and
revisionist, Leary said, "It can be
socially disastrous. You can't go to the
mountains, stay high, and forget your
fellow man."
Cleaver detected "danger in seeing
LSD as a magic liberating wand.
Expanding consciousness may bring
enlightened revolutionary attitude,"
but the Panther questioned the user's
ability to make a serious commitment
to the revolution.
Kannas added that the "abuser
becomes a captured audience; that
can't help the revolution. Nobody is
expendable in South LA where I
work .. . and a ghetto on drugs is a
divided ghetto, an oppressed ghetto."
Leary claimed he never encouraged
escapism. He urged "middle-class

whites to drop out of the involuntary,
plastic social system."
Cleaver told Leary that he (Leary)
had encouraged escape with his whole
turn on, tune in, drop out philosophy.
Countering to Cleaver's charge that
he had left many people "on a
trip," Leary said he didn't have the
right to tell people whether or not to
drop acid.
"We saw an enormous outlaw group
grow out of drug use and that's right
on," Leary claimed.
Defiance—Revolutionaries
Cleaver replied that "defiance made
revolutionaries not the use of drugs."
Leary continued by saying that
"psychedelic drugs can free you
inside . . . loosen you up." The LSD
guru disavowed the media stereotype of
LSD users as "people wandering around
saying 'God is love.' "
The former Harvard professor
offered three examples disapproving
that casting. He said that the
Weathermen use said to "get their
heads together." He also claimed the
militant White Panthers have used it.
His third example was himself.
"Me, ten years ago. I used to be a
liberal professor at Harvard. Now I'm in
Algiers with you, Eldridge," the
short-haired Leary said expressing his
solidarity with Cleaver.
The Panther leader pressed Leary to
make a precise statement on drug use.
Claiming Leary had endorsed taking
acid and dropping out, Cleaver
demanded a clarification.
'They Misread Me'
Leary claimed, "They misread me.
Our actions say what to do."

Leary tried to clarify his posture
toward President Nixon and J. Edgar
Hoover with a new slogan. "Dose them,
blow up their mechanical, fascist
mind."
Cleaver added he'd "do something
else" if he were close enough to slip
them drugs.
Leary continued by saying that LSD
could be great for a "right wing,
Republican, shorthair, jockstrap from
Texas."
Leary's Safety
At one point, Cleaver asked Leary if
he felt safe in Algiers. Leary confirmed
his safety and his solidarity with
Eldridge. "Never during our
confrontation did I consider escape,"
Leary explained.
Talking about other white
revolutionaries, Cleaver said Jerry
Rubin, Stew Alpert, and Abbie
Hoffman "get busted, but we get
killed."
Leary broke in, "I'll say to Jerry and
Abbie and all our brothers and sisters,
we must move on from the postures of
the past ... no more clowning."
Cleaver emphasized, "and toy guns."
The exiled Panther also expressed
his preference for Bernardine Dohrn
over his past VP nominee, Jerry Rubin,
as a possible running mate for President
if the possibility should arise. "I would
also be her presidential running mate,"
he said.
Cleaver concluded by saying this is
"not the time to be guilty of tripping
while our comrades are dying."
Leary said, "I'm with you."
"Right on," Eldridge murmured.
