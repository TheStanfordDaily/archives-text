# Proposed Statement Of The Faculty Political Action Group â€” Part II
## 
### 
(This is the second part of the
three part serialization of the
Proposed Statement of a Faculty
Political Action Group.)
The University is in serious
crisis. The current course of
events promises persistence of the
bias in University programs,
possibly diminshed support of the
University, and increased

repression on campus. We do not
desire this outcome. We seek
instead a University which is an
exciting place of learning for both
students and faculty, where real
issues confronting society are
addressed and clarified, and where
students and faculty generate
mutual allegiance, enthusiasm and
momentum. To achieve this at
Stanford fundamental change is
necessary, change in student body
and faculty, in governance, in
curriculum, and in research
policy. This change requires
redefinition of our intellectual
and social responsibilities and an
expansion of our attention and
our activities to the community in
which Stanford exists.
To accomplish this change, the
following proposals are made. In
making these suggestions, we
intend that the creative
capabilities of the faculty, student
body and staff be more effectively
harnessed, that scholarship be
extended to a broader range of
subjects, and that Stanford's
personnel and programs be
effectively related to the people
and problems of central
California.
CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION
TO THE UNIVERSITY AND
UNIVERSITY FACILITIES
The inquiring mind can learn in
almost any environment; learning
is only in part a product of formal
education. Excellence in
performance and contributions to
society are as much related to
perception, imagination and skill
in new situations as to the
application of accepted practices
in standard situations.
Specifically, there is no consistent
correlation between excellence in
contributions to society and social
or economic status. Recent
experience with students from
minority groups establishes that
educationally disadvantaged

individuals can do well in the
university environment. Therefore
it is proposed that:
1) Stanford University admit
an increasing proportion of young
people of diverse backgrounds
particularly from the Bay Area
and central California who have
demonstrated motivation, talent,
independent critical capacity and
leadership capability.
2) Admission requirements be
redesigned for better
identification of creativity and
independence of applicants.
3) New methods for financing
education be explored, such as
graded tuition, payment of
educational costs out of
subsequent earnings and
governmental vouchers, to provide
support for economically
disadvantaged sstdents.
4) Special assistance programs
be expanded and conducted by
both faculty and students to
compensate for shortcomings of
students in formal educational
preparation.
The rapid development and
obsolescence of technical and
scientific knowledge, the impact
of this knowledge on social
organization, and the need to
change substantial segments of
society, require that opportunities
for higher education no longer be
restricted primarily to the young.
All citizens can benefit from
recurrent opportunities for
humanistic study and/or
revitalization of their technical
professional and general skills.
Therefore it is proposed that:
Stanford develop a program of
continuing adult education open
to citizens of any age which will
permit these individuals to enter
and leave the school for periods of
time compatible with their normal
occupations. These individuals
should not be segregated into
special continuation programs but

rather integrated into the regular
courses which will then serve
full-time and part-time students of
different ages and backgrounds.
Education in certain disciplines
may suffer from isolation in the
environment of the university.
Conversely, if conducted in the
community to which it applies,
education can be substantially
enriched and also demonstrate its
usefulness to people not hitherto
involved. There it is proposed
that:
In order to provide special
knowledge and skills to the
community at large and to derive
ideas for its education and
research programs, the University
organize teaching programs in the
community of mid-California
which will bring faculty and
students into schools, factories,
hospitals, community
governments, etc., to contribute
and to learn from the work of
these bodies. This decentralized
program would be the reciprocal
of the opening of the University
to citizens, and would facilitate a
continuous flow of people and
ideas between the community and
the University.
The shortage of certain
educational facilities and the
limited availability of other
specialized installations make it
desirable that the greatest possible
use and benefit be derived from
those which exist. It is proposed
that:
Buildings and other facilities of
the University be used for
educational programs during the
evening as well as the day. This
would allow a larger number of
individuals to benefit from the
University and permit a broader
group of curricular offerings.
Curriculum
Two important characteristics
of curriculum are breadth of
subject matter and quality of
offerings. Courses at Stanford are
generally of high calibre.
However, in terms of the
aforementioned needs and
problems of society, and breadth
of the curriculum is sharply
limited. The extension of
scholarly study into new and
socially important areas,
currently, neglected, and the
expansion of the curriculum
which would flow therefrom,
would be in the best traditions of
scholarly and educational
innovation. It would probably
also create more diverse career
opportunities for students. It is
proposed that:
1) A University Curriculum
Study Committee composed of
students, faculty, administration,
and representatives of different
community groups in the
mid-California area be established
to suggest ways in which the
cur-iculum could be broadened to
reflect the problems and needs of
the community.
2) The University establish a
mechanism to explore means of
supporting and facilitating
teaching and research by faculty
and students in the new curricular
areas.
Good learning is in significant
part self-learning. Familiarity with
the application of knowledge to
practical problems greatly
enhances an individual's
understanding of a discipline.
The concept of course work be
substantially broadened to include
reading, research and
contemplation at Stanford plus
practical field work in the
surrounding community.

organization, and the need to
change substantial segments of
society, require that opportunities
for higher education no longer be
restricted primarily to the young.
All citizens can benefit from
recurrent opportunities for
humanistic study and/or
revitalization of their technical
professional and general skills.
Therefore it is proposed that:
Stanford develop a program of
continuing adult education open
to citizens of any age which will
permit these individuals to enter
and leave the school for periods of
time compatible with their normal
occupations. These individuals
should not be segregated into
special continuation programs but

rather integrated into the regular
courses which will then serve
full-time and part-time students of
different ages and backgrounds.
Education in certain disciplines
may suffer from isolation in the
environment of the university.
Conversely, if conducted in the
community to which it applies,
education can be substantially
enriched and also demonstrate its
usefulness to people not hitherto
involved. There it is proposed
that:
In order to provide special
knowledge and skills to the
community at large and to derive
ideas for its education and
research programs, the University
organize teaching programs in the
community of mid-California
which will bring faculty and
students into schools, factories,
hospitals, community
governments, etc., to contribute
and to learn from the work of
these bodies. This decentralized
program would be the reciprocal
of the opening of the University
to citizens, and would facilitate a
continuous flow of people and
ideas between the community and
the University.
The shortage of certain
educational facilities and the
limited availability of other
specialized installations make it
desirable that the greatest possible
use and benefit be derived from
those which exist. It is proposed
that:
Buildings and other facilities of
the University be used for
educational programs during the
evening as well as the day. This
would allow a larger number of
individuals to benefit from the
University and permit a broader
group of curricular offerings.
Curriculum
Two important characteristics
of curriculum are breadth of
subject matter and quality of
offerings. Courses at Stanford are
generally of high calibre.
However, in terms of the
aforementioned needs and
problems of society, and breadth
of the curriculum is sharply
limited. The extension of
scholarly study into new and
socially important areas,
currently, neglected, and the
expansion of the curriculum
which would flow therefrom,
would be in the best traditions of
scholarly and educational
innovation. It would probably
also create more diverse career
opportunities for students. It is
proposed that:
1) A University Curriculum
Study Committee composed of
students, faculty, administration,
and representatives of different
community groups in the
mid-California area be established
to suggest ways in which the
cur-iculum could be broadened to
reflect the problems and needs of
the community.
2) The University establish a
mechanism to explore means of
supporting and facilitating
teaching and research by faculty
and students in the new curricular
areas.
Good learning is in significant
part self-learning. Familiarity with
the application of knowledge to
practical problems greatly
enhances an individual's
understanding of a discipline.
The concept of course work be
substantially broadened to include
reading, research and
contemplation at Stanford plus
practical field work in the
surrounding community.
(This is the second part of the
three part serialization of the
Proposed Statement of a Faculty
Political Action Group.)
The University is in serious
crisis. The current course of
events promises persistence of the
bias in University programs,
possibly diminshed support of the
University, and increased

repression on campus. We do not
desire this outcome. We seek
instead a University which is an
exciting place of learning for both
students and faculty, where real
issues confronting society are
addressed and clarified, and where
students and faculty generate
mutual allegiance, enthusiasm and
momentum. To achieve this at
Stanford fundamental change is
necessary, change in student body
and faculty, in governance, in
curriculum, and in research
policy. This change requires
redefinition of our intellectual
and social responsibilities and an
expansion of our attention and
our activities to the community in
which Stanford exists.
To accomplish this change, the
following proposals are made. In
making these suggestions, we
intend that the creative
capabilities of the faculty, student
body and staff be more effectively
harnessed, that scholarship be
extended to a broader range of
subjects, and that Stanford's
personnel and programs be
effectively related to the people
and problems of central
California.
CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION
TO THE UNIVERSITY AND
UNIVERSITY FACILITIES
The inquiring mind can learn in
almost any environment; learning
is only in part a product of formal
education. Excellence in
performance and contributions to
society are as much related to
perception, imagination and skill
in new situations as to the
application of accepted practices
in standard situations.
Specifically, there is no consistent
correlation between excellence in
contributions to society and social
or economic status. Recent
experience with students from
minority groups establishes that
educationally disadvantaged

individuals can do well in the
university environment. Therefore
it is proposed that:
1) Stanford University admit
an increasing proportion of young
people of diverse backgrounds
particularly from the Bay Area
and central California who have
demonstrated motivation, talent,
independent critical capacity and
leadership capability.
2) Admission requirements be
redesigned for better
identification of creativity and
independence of applicants.
3) New methods for financing
education be explored, such as
graded tuition, payment of
educational costs out of
subsequent earnings and
governmental vouchers, to provide
support for economically
disadvantaged sstdents.
4) Special assistance programs
be expanded and conducted by
both faculty and students to
compensate for shortcomings of
students in formal educational
preparation.
The rapid development and
obsolescence of technical and
scientific knowledge, the impact
of this knowledge on social
organization, and the need to

cur-iculum could be broadened to

the community.
2) The University establish a
mechanism to explore means of

teaching and research by faculty
and students in the new curricular
areas.
Good learning is in significant

enhances an individual's
understanding of a discipline.
The concept of course work be

Proposed Statement of a Faculty
Political Action Group.)
The University is in serious
crisis. The current course of
events promises persistence of the
bias in University programs,
possibly diminshed support of the
University, and increased

repression on campus. We do not
desire this outcome. We seek
instead a University which is an
exciting place of learning for both
students and faculty, where real
issues confronting society are
addressed and clarified, and where
students and faculty generate
mutual allegiance, enthusiasm and
momentum. To achieve this at
Stanford fundamental change is
necessary, change in student body
and faculty, in governance, in
curriculum, and in research
policy. This change requires
redefinition of our intellectual
and social responsibilities and an
expansion of our attention and
our activities to the community in
which Stanford exists.
To accomplish this change, the
following proposals are made. In
making these suggestions, we
intend that the creative
capabilities of the faculty, student
body and staff be more effectively
harnessed, that scholarship be
extended to a broader range of
subjects, and that Stanford's
personnel and programs be
effectively related to the people
and problems of central
California.
CRITERIA FOR ADMISSION
TO THE UNIVERSITY AND
UNIVERSITY FACILITIES
The inquiring mind can learn in
almost any environment; learning
is only in part a product of formal
education. Excellence in
performance and contributions to
society are as much related to
perception, imagination and skill
in new situations as to the
application of accepted practices
in standard situations.
Specifically, there is no consistent
correlation between excellence in
contributions to society and social
or economic status. Recent
experience with students from
minority groups establishes that
educationally disadvantaged

individuals can do well in the
university environment. Therefore
it is proposed that:
1) Stanford University admit
an increasing proportion of young
people of diverse backgrounds
particularly from the Bay Area
and central California who have
demonstrated motivation, talent,
independent critical capacity and
leadership capability.
2) Admission requirements be
redesigned for better
identification of creativity and
independence of applicants.
3) New methods for financing
education be explored, such as
graded tuition, payment of
educational costs out of
subsequent earnings and
governmental vouchers, to provide
support for economically
disadvantaged sstdents.
4) Special assistance programs
be expanded and conducted by
both faculty and students to
compensate for shortcomings of
students in formal educational
preparation.
The rapid development and
obsolescence of technical and
scientific knowledge, the impact
of this knowledge on social
organization, and the need to
change substantial segments of
society, require that opportunities
for higher education no longer be
restricted primarily to the young.
All citizens can benefit from
recurrent opportunities for
humanistic study and/or
revitalization of their technical
professional and general skills.
Therefore it is proposed that:
Stanford develop a program of
continuing adult education open
to citizens of any age which will
permit these individuals to enter
and leave the school for periods of
time compatible with their normal
occupations. These individuals
should not be segregated into
special continuation programs but

rather integrated into the regular
courses which will then serve
full-time and part-time students of
different ages and backgrounds.
Education in certain disciplines
may suffer from isolation in the
environment of the university.
Conversely, if conducted in the
community to which it applies,
education can be substantially
enriched and also demonstrate its
usefulness to people not hitherto
involved. There it is proposed
that:
In order to provide special
knowledge and skills to the
community at large and to derive
ideas for its education and
research programs, the University
organize teaching programs in the
community of mid-California
which will bring faculty and
students into schools, factories,
hospitals, community
governments, etc., to contribute
and to learn from the work of
these bodies. This decentralized
program would be the reciprocal
of the opening of the University
to citizens, and would facilitate a
continuous flow of people and
ideas between the community and
the University.
The shortage of certain
educational facilities and the
limited availability of other
specialized installations make it
desirable that the greatest possible
use and benefit be derived from
those which exist. It is proposed
that:
Buildings and other facilities of
the University be used for
educational programs during the
evening as well as the day. This
would allow a larger number of
individuals to benefit from the
University and permit a broader
group of curricular offerings.
Curriculum
Two important characteristics
of curriculum are breadth of
subject matter and quality of
offerings. Courses at Stanford are
generally of high calibre.
However, in terms of the
aforementioned needs and
problems of society, and breadth
of the curriculum is sharply
limited. The extension of
scholarly study into new and
socially important areas,
currently, neglected, and the
expansion of the curriculum
which would flow therefrom,
would be in the best traditions of
scholarly and educational
innovation. It would probably
also create more diverse career
opportunities for students. It is
proposed that:
1) A University Curriculum
Study Committee composed of
students, faculty, administration,
and representatives of different
community groups in the
mid-California area be established
to suggest ways in which the
cur-iculum could be broadened to
reflect the problems and needs of
the community.
2) The University establish a
mechanism to explore means of
supporting and facilitating
teaching and research by faculty
and students in the new curricular
areas.
Good learning is in significant
part self-learning. Familiarity with
the application of knowledge to
practical problems greatly
enhances an individual's
understanding of a discipline.
The concept of course work be
substantially broadened to include
reading, research and
