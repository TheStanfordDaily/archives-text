Stanford's baseball team came
back from the dead in the bottom
of the ninth inning ar.d overcame
a 4-3 deficit to subdue U.C. Davis,
5-4, at Sunken Diamond on
Tuesday. Hod Boone and Dave
Edson provided the key hits in the
final turn of events which
produced an impressive 8-3-1
record for Stanford.
The Indians had a seemingly
secure 3-0 lead going into the top
of the ninth. Unfortunately,
Stanford faded into a defensive
lapse at the same time the Aggie
bats came alive. With two outs
and runners on first and second,
the Aggies pounded out a double
and two singles while a throwing
error allowed the lead run to
score.
Boone opened the ninth on a
hopeful note for Stanford with a

single to right, his third hit in four
at bats. A wild pitch and sacrifice
bunt pushed Boone. Then, Bob
Reece hit a smash directly to the
shortstop which held Boone at
third and produced the second
out. Mark Lucich walls ed, and
Bob Marshall singled to tie the
score at 4 -4 .
The stage was set fittingly for
Dave Edson who had produced at
the plate earlier in the game, but
was almost the goat with his
fielding lapse. Edson slammed a
drive toward deep right center
which bounced over the fence for
a ground rule double and secured
a dramatic 5-4 victory.
The win went to Bruce Schoen,
his first decision of the season.
Pitchers Jim Coate, Bob Scott,
and Schoen had held Davis
scoreless for eight innings on four
hits, but were almost denied the
satisfaction by the leaky ninth.


JUST WAIT—Kip Oxman kicks for louch in last Saturday's action
with UCLA. Oxmpn got the ball out of bounds on this play, but
found better targets than the sideline later in the day - the goal posts
on a two point conversion following a try by ace back Stewart Wilson.
Wilson booted two penalty kicks himself in the Indians' 14-9 victory
over previously unbeaten UCLA.
