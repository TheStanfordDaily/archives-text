# Cards Drop Pair
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
After two more losses this past
week, Stanford's basketball team's
chances of escaping the Pacific 8
cellar are becoming smaller and
smaller. By losing to Washington
State Saturday night and to
Washington on Monday night, the
Indians have run their league
record to 1-9 with only four
games remaining to be played.
Nevertheless, the Cards played
some of their best ball of the
season up in the Great Northwest.
Against the Cougars in Pullman
before a West Coast TV audience,
the Indians displayed their
amazing ability to fall behind,
catch up and then barely lose.
After falling 1 7 points behind
the Cougars early in the going, the
Cards came back to within one
point at 64-63 with none minutes
left in the game. Unfortunately,
the Indian comeback fell short,
and WSU provailed 89-79.
Following this tough loss, the
Cards came back to play one of
their best games of the season on
the University of Washington's
tartan surfaced court.
Disregarding their normal pattern,
the Indians stayed with the
Huskies all the way, and led at
halftime, 40-39.
In the second half the lead
changed hands on numerous
occasions. The turning point of
the game seemed to be when the
Indians missed two one on one
free throw opportunities in the
last two minutes. This was rather
ironic, as the Cards are the best
free-throw shooting club in the
conference, and until this game
generally made most of their
important free tosses.
The Huskies, on the other
hand, made four clutch free
throws in the last fourteen
seconds, and sewed up the win
72-69. They were carried
throughout the game by their
6'10" center, Steve Hawes, who
led the Huskie scoring with 2 4
points.
Claude Terry, who is third in
Pac-8 scoring behind Sidney Wicks

of U.C.L.A. and Stan Love or
Oregon, led the Indians with 24
points. Bob Buell, who
undoubtedly played his best game
of the season, added 1 4 points.
