# Shultz Stars
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
If they awarded game galls,
rugby, last Saturday's would have
to go to Jack Shultz. Running and
tackling as if he had a personal
grudge against UCLA, Shultz
made several spectacular plays late
in the second period to prevent
the Bruins from scoring, and to
preserve the Indians' H-9 victory
over the West wood ruggers.
UCLA came unbeaten to the
Farm, but ran into a Stanford
team determined to get back in
the win column after having
dropped two consecutive matches
to Santa Barba and the Peninsula
Ramblers.
The Tribe put all of their
points on the board in as strong as
first half as they've played all
season. Stanford's scrum play was
particularly sharp as the forwards
were binding and rucking with an
intensity they haven't
demonstrated since the victory
over the BATS.
The Indian backs were moving
the ball smoothly along the line,
turning upfield and making their
own running room through the

Bruin backfield. Stewart Wilson
and Reggie Sanderson each broke
loose tor a try, and Kip Oxinan
added a conversion. Wilson also
contributed a pair of penalty
kicks to geve the Tribe a 14-3
bulge early in the second period.
The Indians slowed up as the
second half wore on, and the
Bruins took advantage of the
change of pace to get in position
for two more penalty kicks,
narrowing the gap to five points,
the equivelent of a try and a
conversion.
As time was running out,
UCLA got the ball out, broke
loose at about midfield, and
turning it on, the Bruin back
appeared destined for an easy try
squarely under the goal posts.
Enter Jack Shultz who had spent
the day bottling up and running
over one Kermit Alexander.
Slanting across the field from
his wing position, Shultz collared
the runaway Bruin at the five,
stripped him from the ball at the
goal line, and fell on it in the
endzone to force a 25 yard
dropout and save the ball game
for the Indians.
