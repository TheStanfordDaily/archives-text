Heavy Raids Launched
SAIGON — American planes attacked missile sites in
North Vietnam last night and this morning while
three more helicopters were lost and 11 U.S.
crewmen killed in Laos, the U.S. Command said.
Following heavy weekend blows in the North, the
air attacks were conducted by FlO5 fighter-bombers
escorting B5 2 bombers apparently raiding mountain
passes through which Hanoi sends men and supplies
into the Ho Chi Minh trail.
Results of the latest strikes were unknown.
No new ground engagements were reported
Wednesday in the Laos operation which has been
stalled for a week.
In Washington, Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
said South Vietnamese troops may be embroiled in
heavy fighting in Cambodia soon as well as in Laos.
He emphasized South Vietnamese gains in Laos
despite the slowdown and said: "Their objectives are
being achieved."
The loss of three more helicopters brought to 29
the number of choppers officially announced as lost
since the South Vietnamese push into Laos began
Feb. 8.
Casualties in the helicopter losses now total 4 0
killed, 15 missing and 26 wounded, according to
official figures.
The latest air strikes came after U.S. planes
launched Saturday and Sunday the heaviest raids in
North Vietnam in three months.
Democrats Ask Withdrawal
WASHINGTON — Senate Democrats voted 31 to 8
yesterday to seek the withdrawal of all U.S. forces
from Indochina during the two years of the 92 nd
Congress.

The Democrats declared they would seek the
withdrawal of all U.S. forces and the release of all
prisoners "in a time certain," but specified no date.
"The purpose behind this is constructive, to be
helpful to the President . . . and to bring about an end
to this tragic and mistaken war," said Sen. Mike
Mansfield of Montana, the majority leader.
But Sen. Henry M. Jackson of Washington, a
leading critic of the resolution during a two-hour
caucus debate, said it amounted to another attempt
to impose a deadline for American withdrawal.
Jackson and Sen. John Stennis, D-Miss., chairman
of the Armed Services Committee, said they were
among the eight Democrats who voted against the
resolution.
Drafter by the Senate Democratic Policy
Committee, the resolution declares that the Senate
majority should work in the 92 nd Congress "to end
the involvement in Indochina and to bring about the
withdrawal of all U.S. forces and the release of all
U.S. forces and the release of all prisoners in a certain
time."
Wage Boom Checked
WASHINGTON — President Nixon applied the
leverage of billions of dollars in federal building
contracts yesterday rather than outright government
controls in an emergency action against skyrocketing
wages in the construction industry.
The President, acting after administration efforts
failed to get the building trades unions to take
voluntary measures, suspended provisions of the
4 0-year-old Davis-Bacon Act that requires the
government to pay prevailing wages on federal
construction projects.
The act has had the effect of setting rates at the
highest levels for both public and private building in
the construction areas.

In a lengthy statement accompanied by an official
proclamation of suspension, for an indefinite time,
Nixon declared:
"The action I have taken today is based on the
principle that government programs which contribute
to excessive wage and price increases must be
modified or rescinded in periods of inflation."
Secretary of Labor James I). Hodgson told
reporters at the White House that about $25 billion
worth of federal and federally assisted construction
projects are affected.
Calley Confesses
FT. BENNING, CJa. — Lt. William L. Calley Jr.
admitted yesterday that he fired at a handful of
Vietnamese civilians at My Lai nearly three years
ago, and decreed the mass execution of others. But he
said he felt he did no wrong.
"I never sat down and analyzed whether they were
men, women and children-they were enemy not
people," Calley told the couri-martial jury of six
superior officers trying him on charges of
premeditated murder of 102 My Lai villagers on
March 1 6, 1 968.
"It was a group of people who were the enemy,
sir," Calley testified at another point. "I was ordered
to go in there and destroy the enemy. That was my
job that day. That was my mission .. .
"I felt then and I still do that I acted as I was
directed and that I carried out orders 1 was given.
And I do not feel I was wrong in doing so, sir."
Calley said he fired fewer than 18 rounds from his
Ml 6 automatic rifle during an infantry assault on My
Lai. Among his targets, he added, were Vietnamese
men, women and children in a ditch. He denied a
sizable number of other civilian murders charged
against him.
