### 
Suspect Arrested
Aaron Manganiello, a member of the
Venceremos Central Committee, has
been arrested in connection with the
beatings of three Free Campus
Movement members on White Plaza,
the night of February 10.
Manganiello was charged with two
counts of assault, released on $ 5 0 0 bail.
He was picked up before midnight
Monday night by Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies.
A warrant is out for the arrest of
Michael Fox, also in connection with
the beatings. Fox, one of 17 names in
the temporary restraining order of
February 12, has indicated he will turn
himself in.
After a rally in the Old Union
Courtyard, 4 0 people were reported to
have jumped the FCM members,
hospitalizing one. An FCM spokesman
stated at that time that charges would
be pressed.
Case Dismissed
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
yesterday dismissed the case of student
Michael Holman, charged with
advocating and encouraging window
breaking last fall.
Holman's suspension had recently
been recommended by the Council for
participation in the Lodge disruption.
Commenting on yesterday's
dismissed case, defense counsel Ted
Smith called the charges against

Holman "an act of political
harassment."
"We had seen his (University
prosecutor John Schwartz's) evidence
and anyone with any legal knowledge
could have told you he had no case."
Smith added that plans are under
way to have Schwartz either removed
or reprimanded.
The University has dropped charges
against New Left Project member
Lenny Siegel, the Daily learned
recently.
Siegel had been charged with
violating "the elemental standards of
behavior" requisite of a member of the
Stanford community.
Town Congress Set
The First Stanford Town Congress
and Project Dig-in, a newly-formed
group protesting Stanford involvement
with the Indochina War, is issuing five
informational pamphlets today.
According to a statement issued by
the group, the pamphlets are designed
to "present. . . the actions of the
Stanford corporation and its dealings
with industries, corporations, and
investments which directly support the
Indochina war."
The subjects of the pamphlets are:
"The Stanford Trustees," "The
Stanford Industrial Park," "The
Stanford Portfolio," "Dig-In"
and "Call for the First
Stanford Town Congress and Project
Dig-In."
