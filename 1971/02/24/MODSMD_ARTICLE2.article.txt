# Willow Expressway
## Fight Launched Against Project 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
In a fight against what it terms
"false progress," a Menlo Park group,
called the "Citizens Against The Willow
Expressway," has launched a door to
door canvassing campaign to convince
the voters of Menlo Park that the
proposed Willow Expressway will
"create more problems than it will
solve."
According to Ida Morris, a
co-chairman of the group, the
"expressway will only increase the
overdevelopment of the Midpeninsula
and particularly of Menlo Park." She
said that the group feels that the
expressway's purpose is "to open up
the Foothills, especially the Stanford
lands there, for industrial development
and luxury apartments, while making it
possible for them to bring in
commuters from as far away as the East
Bay," where more low cost housing is
available.
In a speech given before the State
Highway Commission last October,
Mrs. Morris claimed that the proposed
expressway would displace 4 33

households comprised mainly of blacks,
middle-income families and many
elderly and infirm couples.
She then pointed an accusing finger
at the commission and asked why the
proposed expressway route wipes out
164 low-rent apartment units in East
Menlo Park on the northwest side of
Willow Road, "while on the southeast
side it doesn't touch the spacious front
lawns and parking lots of the businesses
in the Kavanaugh Industrial Park."
Avoids Sunset Magazine
She added that "beyond Gilbert, in
Menlo Park, the proposed expressway
swings off Willow Road into
moderate-income housing in the
Willows and across the street into
similar housing in Palo Alto, rather
than going straight through the Lane
Publishing Company (Sunset
Magazine), a route which would miss
most of that housing."
In a recent policy statement the
group said that the long term effects of
the expressway would be far more
severe than just displacing housing.

"The overdevelopment will force up
land values and with them the taxes
and the rents." The traffic will increase
on local streets and according to one of
the group co-chairmen, the Willow
Expressway will become part of a
major East-West Interstate highway
which will extend from Davis to San
Gregorio.
Mrs. Morris emphasized that despite
the open meetings that have been held,
the "Citizens Against the Willow
Expressway" need to canvass to the
convince voters that the traffic problem
in Menlo Park can be solved without
the expressway. "We only have ten
months left to stop it." Another open
meeting of the group is planned for
Thursday night at 7:30 at the Menlo
Oaks School.
Superblock Defeat Helpful
The co-chairman stated that the
recent defeat of the Palo Alto
Superblock had helped thier cause in
two ways. First, she said, "it shows that
the voters can stop overdevelopment.
And second, if it had been built,

Superblock would have forced the
construction of the Willow Expressway
because of the large increase in traffic
volume."
This group, like the Citizens
Committee to Block the Superblock, is
concerned about the air and noise
pollution that would result from the
construction of the new expressway. If
built, some maintain it will carry up to
100,000 cars a day and by 1990 will
probably become a full-fledged
freeway, carrying very heavy truck
traffic.
The State Highway Commission says
that noise will be reduced by placing
the roadway below ground level, except
for the section which is slated to pass
through East Menlo Park and the Belle
Haven heighborhood. Here the freeway
would be at ground level because of
"expense."
Won't Reduce Noise
Mrs. Morris says that experiments
with "sunken" expressways in other
cities such as Detroit have shown that
they will "not reduce truck noise." She
added that by building the Willow
Expressway through Menlo Park, the
"state and local governments will
pretty much commit themselves to
putting the Peninsula end of the new
Southern Crossing bridge at Menlo
Park . . . making Menlo Park the major
focus of traffic from as far away as the
Central Valley."
Mrs. Morris said the Citizens Against
the Willow Expressway strongly feel
that the Bay Area is already
"overdeveloped" and that "any further
increase of industry, people, and
expressways will just damage our
ecology and our communities all the
more. We're for stopping the continual
planned, piecemeal destruction of our
environment and our community. We
think that would be progress."
