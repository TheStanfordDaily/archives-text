# Political Action Group Considers War Research, Judicial System
## 
### DAVE GLOSSBRENNER 
"The major issue now is that we
(Stanford University) continue to
support the war" declared Gary Salt as
he addressed a meeting of the Faculty
Political Action Group (FPAG) last
night.
Salt spoke on war research here and
presented several proposals for FPAG
including one that would require the
banning of all research that would
"enhance the government ability to
wage war."
The meeting, held in the Tresidder
large lounge, was addressed by a series
of speakers which included Yale
Braunstein, a student, Bruce Franklin,
suspended English professor and Avram
Goldstein, professor of Pharmacology.
In an informal, open discussion much
of the faculty and students audience
submitted their own proposals and
directed questions at the speakers.
Salt spoke on the administration's
policy of subcontracting research
projects which in themselves are not
war related but contribute to a larger
war research project. This is done, he
said, so that certain research can meet
University regulations. "I feel it is time
to make some resolutions and perhaps
take some actions that conflict with the
United States Government policy," Salt
added.
Research Guidelines Discussed
While commenting on the proposals
put forward by Salt, Ronald Rebholz,
associate professor or English, said that
all research resulted in power through
knowledge of man's environment and
that this power could conceivably
"enhance" the government's ability to
wage war. He went on U> say that we
should concentrate on that research

that is intimately related to making
war.
Following Rebholz the topic of the
guidelines for research that resulted
from the sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Lab two years ago were
discussed. It was suggested that these
guidelines be reviewed.
Leonard Herzenberg, professor of
genetics, presented two proposals of
Pierre Noyes, professor at SLAC. These
include the prohibition of Stanford
acting as an agent through which
people can get government security
clearance. The suggestion arose from a
statement by Noyes at a FPAG meeting
last Thursday disclosing an allegedly
concealed contract in 1 966. (Please
note: In the February 19th Daily the
date of this contract was erroneously
reported as 1969.)
Judicial Procedures Criticized
Yale Braunstein who spoke after
Salt, claimed that the University
administration has enacted rules and
regulations that have never been passed
by the Student Conduct Legislative
Council. He said examples of such
actions were the hiring of a "paid
prosecutor" and giving the chairman of
the Judicial Council power to declare
contempt.
Professor Goldstein also criticized
judicial policy. Mis solution to the
problem of internal judical procedures
is to get rid of them all. He claimed
that a person is subject to double
jeopardy when he is tried by both
University and the civil courts.
Franklin then discussed his own
involvement with the judicial system,
lie said that "the attempt, to ban all the
members of Veneeremos from campus
is designed to break the back of the
workers' movement." The faculty is

not going to make any fundamental
change . . . since the majority of the
faculty benefit from American
imperialism," he said. Franklin
admitted, however, that the
administration will probably listen
more readily to the faculty than to
students.
