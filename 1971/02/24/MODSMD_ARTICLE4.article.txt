# Finances Force Move
## Mayfield New Home For Dekes 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Residents of the University
residence Mayfield House will be
evicted next year to make room for the
Delta Kap;ja Epsilort (Deke) fraternity,
according to the Dean of Students
Office.
The Deke residents will vacate their
present living facility in the fraternity
cluster by Co well Health Center to
move to the smaller Mayfield House.
The fraternity has been unable to meet
its financial obligations in the Cowell
Cluster Residence, according to John
Grube, assistant dean of students.
Mayfield is located on Mayfield
Avenue, on what is known as the Row.
Mayfield is currently one of two
all-male, upper-class University
residences. The other is Burbank House
in Stern.
It was rumored earlier this quarter
that another fraternity, Chi Psi, would
also move to the Row next fall but
Grube has indicated that it will remain
in its present house through the spring
of 1972. At that time the fraternity
will move to a Bow house if members

can prove that they can adequately
support themselves financially. If they
fail to do so, the fraternity will most
likely dissolve.
Mayfield 'Upset'
Mayfield House President, Bill
Jordan, termed residents of the House
"upset" at the notification that they
must look for another place to live next
year. In a recent letter to Robert
Freelan, Dean of Students, Jordan said:
"Mayfield is unique on the campus, and
the only other living group which is
comparable statistically is Burbank,
though I would submit that this is the
only way in which the two are
comparable. Mayfield, therefore, is the
only alternative to Burbank, and you
are doing the University a great
disservice by destroying that option."
Mayfield residents especially resent
being replaced by the Deke House.
Jordan claims Mayfield residents know
the Dekes principally as the people who
have on several occasions set fire to a
sign pul up in fronl of the Columbac
(non-violent) House
Mayfield House was apparently

chosen to be replaced by the Dekes
because it is the least popular of the
University residences on the Row and
has the highest resident turnover rate.
Grube said Mayfield residents will have
first priority in the spring housing
draw.
'Historical Obligations'
Grube said the University feels an
"historical obligation" to the alumni of
the fraternity who have donated money
and cannot let it die when it still has
enough members to exist somewhere
on campus. He feels this is more
important than maintaining Mayfield
House as it is presently constituted.
The DKK house has traditionally
maintained a membership of only .'lO to
.15. The Cowell cluster residences have
a capacity of 50 and about 15 residents
are necessary for the rent to the
University for the University. 'Hie
fraternity has attempted to !>olstcr its
membership and to take boarders to
meet the costs but has failed.
The University has not decided what
will l>e done with the vacated cluster
house next year.

will l>e done with the vacated cluster
house next year.
Residents of the University
residence Mayfield House will be
evicted next year to make room for the
Delta Kap;ja Epsilort (Deke) fraternity,
according to the Dean of Students
Office.
The Deke residents will vacate their
present living facility in the fraternity
cluster by Co well Health Center to
move to the smaller Mayfield House.
The fraternity has been unable to meet
its financial obligations in the Cowell
Cluster Residence, according to John
Grube, assistant dean of students.
Mayfield is located on Mayfield
Avenue, on what is known as the Row.
Mayfield is currently one of two
all-male, upper-class University
residences. The other is Burbank House
in Stern.
It was rumored earlier this quarter
that another fraternity, Chi Psi, would
also move to the Row next fall but
Grube has indicated that it will remain
in its present house through the spring
of 1972. At that time the fraternity
will move to a Bow house if members

can prove that they can adequately
support themselves financially. If they
fail to do so, the fraternity will most
likely dissolve.
Mayfield 'Upset'
Mayfield House President, Bill
Jordan, termed residents of the House
"upset" at the notification that they
must look for another place to live next
year. In a recent letter to Robert
Freelan, Dean of Students, Jordan said:
"Mayfield is unique on the campus, and
the only other living group which is
comparable statistically is Burbank,
though I would submit that this is the
only way in which the two are
comparable. Mayfield, therefore, is the
only alternative to Burbank, and you
are doing the University a great
disservice by destroying that option."
Mayfield residents especially resent
being replaced by the Deke House.
Jordan claims Mayfield residents know
the Dekes principally as the people who
have on several occasions set fire to a
sign pul up in fronl of the Columbac
(non-violent) House
Mayfield House was apparently

chosen to be replaced by the Dekes
because it is the least popular of the
University residences on the Row and
has the highest resident turnover rate.
Grube said Mayfield residents will have
first priority in the spring housing
draw.
'Historical Obligations'
Grube said the University feels an
"historical obligation" to the alumni of
the fraternity who have donated money
and cannot let it die when it still has
enough members to exist somewhere
on campus. He feels this is more
important than maintaining Mayfield
House as it is presently constituted.
The DKK house has traditionally
maintained a membership of only .'lO to
.15. The Cowell cluster residences have
a capacity of 50 and about 15 residents
are necessary for the rent to the
University for the University. 'Hie
fraternity has attempted to !>olstcr its
membership and to take boarders to
meet the costs but has failed.
The University has not decided what
will l>e done with the vacated cluster
house next year.
