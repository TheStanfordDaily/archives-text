# Budget Cuts Force Physical Plant Layoff
## 
### 
Up to 20 physical plant employees
will be laid off this spring because of
budget cuts, Elbridge Bacon Jr.,
director of the plant, announced
yesterday.
In a memorandum to all plant
employees, Bacon announced "with
great reluctance... a mandatory
reduction of the force within the
department." He said the exact number
of employees to be terminated has not
yet been determined, but it will be
between 16 and 20.
Bacon's memo indicated the
performance of every employee would
be reviewed by a special Evaluation
Committee before deciding whom to
lay off.
Factors to be evaluated include
"performance, length of service, and
ability to do the work remianing in the
department."
The employees facing "termination"
will be given a thirty day notice by
April 15, according to Bacon.

Layoffs last week at Tresidder
Union have triggered calls for a boycott
of the Union. A sparse crowd of about
100 people at a noon rally yesterday
heard pleas to boycott Tresidder until
the 12 workers laid off are rehired.
Speakers also protested the
suspension of library worker John
Keilch, who received a three month
suspension for participation in the
Lodge disruption.
Jim Berks, an engineer at Stanford
Linear Accelerator, said that a total of
41 workers are scheduled to be laid off
there by the University, not incluidng
student workers.
"We haven't created the necessary
pressure yet on the administration to
end these layoffs."
Retrain, Rehire
He urged workers to organize and
pressure the administration to either
retrain, relocate, or rehire the fired
workers.
Cassandra Butler, a black worker at
the Hoover Institute, said that "any
time 100 people get laid off, you can
bet 75 percent of them will be people
of color. Wo have formed a black
caucus for all peoples of color, and we
will present demands that will have to
be met."
Robert Nelson, director of personnel
and employee relations, appeared at the
rally. He said the demands concerning
layoffs and Keilch's suspension "are
important demands and they deserve
consideration."
Asked by several members of the
groups why some of the University's
high-paid administrators did not cut
their own salaries to provide additional
funds, Nelson replied, "I'll have to
defer comment on that."
Hearings Criticized
At the rally, Keilch criticized
grievance hearings concerning his
suspension: "The whole thing's a joke."
lie said the hearings "observe the case"
and "gloss over the issue."
At the hearings yesterday, Keilch
charged Director of Libraries David C.
Weber is "prejudiced against anyone
who actively opposes the war and those
who keep it going."
Weber defended his role in
suspending Keilch, denying it involved
prejudice. He said that "as a librarian"
his concern was with "the relation of
the library to higher education."
