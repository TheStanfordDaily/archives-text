## Presidential Leadership? 
###

President Lyman has partially lost the reigns of
moral leadership on campus. He has, is, and
probably will continue to be preoccupied more with
"fortress building" than "trail-blazing."
The present crisis over the Laos invasion
highlights the leadership dearth. Revolutionaries
manipulating liberals' sensibilities provide the most
highly visible moral persuasion.
But the leadership crisis has not been limited to
the last few days. There hasn't been terribly much
presidential initiative since Kenneth Pitzer, in his
first few months of office, took strong stands
against the war, some kinds of war-related research,
and the ordering of national priorities.
Unfortunately, Pitzer soon succumbed to the
seemingly overwhelming drive for University
self-protection, self-fortification, Last spring his
aprincipled stand on the ROTC issue left him and
other administrators barricaded in Building 10
searching for ways to save academia.
I remember emerging from a meeting with Pitzer
and Lyman during the student strike with the
profound feeling that the two men had become cut
off from the University proper. They seemed to
have been trapped in Building 10 evacuation
procedures and isolated from the strong currents of
opinion that were running through the campus
those days.
This year Lyman has done better. His weekly
press conferences have made important
contributions to his visibility; and dining with
students has been beneficial. But, such activities
have not provided us a clear vision of what he wants
to see the University become.
The Laos invasion and the radical activity of the
past few weeks have again strongly challenged the
president's leadership. The Monday after the South
Vietnamese crossed the border, he responded with a
short half-page statement on the invasion and

radical activity; and, later in the day he visited
dorms to talk to students about the Indochina crisis.
Then, on Thursday of the same week, Lyman
denounced "this obscene war" in a KZSU speech.
But the predictably antiseptic denunciation was
dropped into a longer statement on radical
activities. It seemed sandwiched, defensive,
bloodless, forced. Coming as it did four days after
the invasion had begun and two weeks after it had
become obvious it would occur, the speech was
more an exercise in fellowship than leadership.
Similarly, the president's letter to the New York
Times, published in last Friday's edition, seemed
more an attempt to lead the thought of the elite,
liberal community than ours.
The point is that the moral leadership has been
lost in the self-defense. The proper balance has not
been struck between the two.
What I ask is that Lyman assume a slightly more
political than academic role; that he make clear now
he thinks the University should fit into society at
each crucial point in time.
This sort of role may not suit Lyman's academic
style, but 1 think he is flexible enough that this need
not be the case. The great conflict within the
University today is ever how the institution plugs
into a society racked with war and poverty. The
president needs to present his vision of the
University's role clearly and hope to inspire the
community with it.
it was only a few years ago that Stanford was
commonly said to be "on the threshold of
greatness."
We now need that same kind of inspirational
leadership to lead the University out of the
force-counterforce, fortress-building stage, and into
a period where knowledge can be arrived at freely
and dispersed effectively to help construct and
improve society.
