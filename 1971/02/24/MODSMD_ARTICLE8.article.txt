sexual equality
Editor, THE DAILY:
That men are different from
women is a biological fact, much
as blacks are biologically different
from whites, and this difference
has historically been a cause for
discrimination. Most "liberal"
institutions have discontinued
overt discrimination against blacks
— we would be astounded to see
an advertisement "Wanted: white
skinned students; this is an equal
opportunity employer"— yet
daily we are exposed to the same
advertisement for women:
"Wanted: students without
vaginas, uteruses, and ovaries; this
is an equal opportunity
employer."
Women do not come without
vaginas, uteruses and ovaries, any
more than blacks come with white
skins, and to treat them as if they
did is discrimination of the most
insidious type. For it is this sort

of reasoning that says "Let men
postpone having children."
It is this sort of reasoning that
says "Giving pap smears is an
'extra' the student health cannot
afford" although several thousand
students are affected by this
policy.
Equality between the sexes
cannot be achieved by ignoring
biological differences and their
consequences but by providing
the means to cope with them.
Such means must include 1)
methods to control fertility, 2)
medical care should pregnancy
occur, 3) child care should birth
occur. That is, the institutions
which maintain and reinforce
covert sexual discrimination must
be changed to promote overt
sexual equality by admitting the
biological differences and treating
them as such.
