# Lyman, Black Students Meet In Heated Session

### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Lyman told black students
Tuesday he would oppose construction
of the Willow Expressway if it would
result in a net loss of housing.
An estimated 164 homes would be
demolished under the present
alignment for the Expressway, which
will run from the Dunbarton Bridge to
Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. While
those being displaced would receive
financial compensation, Lyman stated
the construction would be
unacceptable "unless it's done in a way
to replace on a one-for-one basis houses
to be destroyed."
Lyman's position partially satisfied
one of the 21 demands issued Monday
by the Black Students Union. The BSU
holds that every black person whose
home will be destroyed should be
relocated within the East Bayshore
community.
The remarks came during a two hour
special BSU meeting, attended by some
200 blacks. Eew present seemed
satisfied with the session; some
members of the audience accused
Lyman of "tossing crumbs to black
students."
Blantly Negative
BSU Co-chairman Willie Newberry
said the president was "blatantly
negative and evasive."
Associate Provost Raymond
Bacchetti, who accompanied Lyman to
the meeting, said the President left
Jordan Hall in a mild mood. Others
present reported he appeared "really,
really angry."
Lyman also seemed apprehensive
about the outcome of the session.

During his weekly KZSU news
conference Tuesday evening, he
commented that the meeting was
"pretty hostile" in tone. "I'm not sure
either of us gained as much as we may
have lost from the meeting," he added.
He indicated that a "great many" of
the demands were "not possible" in
their present form because they would
require that the University spend

money for non-university purposes or
turn over control of admissions,
financial aid and curriculum to
sub-groups within the University.
Citing admissions as an example, he
stated complete responsibility to
"screen, accept or reject applicants
from one minority group" could not be
given to faculty students and
adminisrators of the same group. "You

can t get away from the fact that it is a
university ... it has to be one
decision," he commented.
One Institution
"The University has to remain one
institution or it will be no institution.
The alternative is not a federation of
several institutions; it is no institution."

IN THE BEGINNINGâ€”In April of 196 8 members of the BSU took over the stage at Mem. Aud. to demand greater
representation of minorities at Stanford. Tuesday the BSU met with President Lyman concerning 21 recent demands. BSU
co-chairman Williw Newberry said Lyman was "blatantly negative and evasive."
Lyman tried to ease fears that
layoffs prompted by financial cutbacks
will primarily effect minority
employees. He explained the University
requires that layoffs not be based on
seniority alone, reducing the risk of the
"last to come, first to go" policies
which plague minority workers.
A strongly-worded BSU statement
to the Daily read in part, "Seldom has
the University failed to come to grips
with problems of its own rascism as
President Lyman failed yesterday.
"He showed a complete lack of
understanding of the needs and feelings
of the Stanford Black Community. In
refuting the majority of the Black
demands, Lyman argued that there
wasn't any money, university policies
wouldn't allow implementation, and
finally, that he couldn't allow Black
people the exercise of such perrogatives
for determining their future.
For these reasons, Lyman was
correct in accessing the mood of the
large Black audience as being hostile. It
would have been irresponsible and

stupid for any serious group of Blacks
to sit unperturbed, while presented
with such a ridiculous set of evasions
and insensitivities."
Hie potential for a BSU
Administration confrontation became
apparent on Tuesday, February 10. At
a noon rally in White Plaza, Newberry
presented Associate Provost
Rosensweig with 10 grievances. These
included University support of the
Willow Expressway, of "racist white
regimes in Africa" and "its
participation in the destruction of
Ravenswood High School through its
assistance in the formulation of the
Sequoia desegregation plan."
The level of protest escalated with
the book - in at the Undergraduate
Library on February 17. Shortly before
the library closed, approximately 75
black students piled over 1,000 books
at the check-out counter.
The incident came after the
expiration of a one week deadline for
Administration response set by the
BSU. Apparently the Administration
had not officially commented on the
grievances during this period.
