# Lyman, Black Students Meet In Heated Session

### RALPH KOSTANT 
President Lyman told black students
Tuesday he would oppose construction
of the Willow Expressway if it would
result in a net loss of housing.
An estimated 164 homes would be
demolished under the present
alignment for the Expressway, which
will run from the Dunbarton Bridge to
Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park. While
those being displaced would receive
financial compensation, Lyman stated
the construction would be
unacceptable "unless it's done in a way
to replace on a one-for-one basis houses
to be destroyed."
Lyman's position partially satisfied
one of the 21 demands issued Monday
by the Black Students Union. The BSU
holds that every black person whose
home will be destroyed should be
relocated within the East Bayshore
community.
The remarks came during a two hour
special BSU meeting, attended by some
200 blacks. Eew present seemed
satisfied with the session; some
members of the audience accused
Lyman of "tossing crumbs to black
students."
Blantly Negative
BSU Co-chairman Willie Newberry
said the president was "blatantly
negative and evasive."
Associate Provost Raymond
Bacchetti, who accompanied Lyman to
the meeting, said the President left
Jordan Hall in a mild mood. Others
present reported he appeared "really,
really angry."
Lyman also seemed apprehensive
about the outcome of the session.

During his weekly KZSU news
conference Tuesday evening, he
commented that the meeting was
"pretty hostile" in tone. "I'm not sure
either of us gained as much as we may
have lost from the meeting," he added.
He indicated that a "great many" of
the demands were "not possible" in
their present form because they would
require that the University spend

money for non-university purposes or
turn over control of admissions,
financial aid and curriculum to
sub-groups within the University.
Citing admissions as an example, he
stated complete responsibility to
"screen, accept or reject applicants
from one minority group" could not be
given to faculty students and
adminisrators of the same group. "You

can t get away from the fact that it is a
university ... it has to be one
decision," he commented.
One Institution
"The University has to remain one
institution or it will be no institution.
The alternative is not a federation of
several institutions; it is no institution."
