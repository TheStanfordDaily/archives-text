# BSU: Newly Revived Center Of Activism
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT News Analysis 
President Lyman pledged Monday his strong "personal and institutional
commitment to follow the path set out in 1968 to the end that this shall not be a
lily - white institution, that it shall not be ignorant of or insensitive to the needs
of minority communities."
Stanford did not spontaneously develop a social conscience. Only 70 black
students were enrolled here three years ago, on April 4,1968, the day that Martin
Luther King was assasinated. Calls for more black admissions met with a familiar
response. There just weren't any more qualified candidates.
The death of King spurred the University to produce a "Response to Racism."
Stanford's immediate answer to racism was not an active program to recruit black
students. It consisted of a daylong colloquium. However, the administration did
give some concessions. Provost Lyman announced that students should feel free
not to attend classes in order to participate in the day's activities.
At this point, the shit hit the fan. In the middle of Lyman's speech at the
program in Memorial Auditorium, black student Ken Washington seized the
microphone and shouted for the audience of 1 700 whites, to "Put your money
where your mouth is!" Frank Satterwhite read a long list of demands on black
admissions. Then 70 blacks walked out of Memorial Auditorium to a standing
ovation.

Within seven hours, President Wallace Sterling issued a reply to the BSU
demands. The pledge for action included doubling minority enrollment by 1969 -
1 9 70, doubling the proportion of minority employees in one year, and most
importantly, the admission of 10 minority students "who do not meet minimal
academic requirements."
Two years later, nine of these ten students were enrolled and in good academic
standing. The myth of "no qualified applicants" was shattered and the bias of the
University's admission requirements exposed.
Relations between the Administration and the BSU has run hot and cold since
April, 1 968. Generally negotiations were conducted quietly, but flare-ups
occurred. On Feb. 21, 1969, President Pitzer was scheduled to meet with BSU
leaders over a list of 12 demands. Due to an apparent misunderstanding, he failed
to show, and later that afternoon some 15 angry blacks rampaged through the
bookstore, causing damages in excess of $1,000.
Since that time the BSU has been a comparatively quiescent organization, with
white radical groups such as Off-ROTC and Venceremos assuming the mantle of
campus militancy. Twice successful in electing slates to the ASSU Senate, the BSU
is privately viewed by radicals as having been co-opted. MECHA, (a chicano
student group) charged last spring that the BSU is less concerned with defending
the rights of all Third World peoples than with protecting a student fee allotment
of over $8,000.
Time of Searching
Perhaps for this reason, fall quarter seemed to be a time of self-searching for
the BSU. Its remodled newspaper, The Real News, spent as much copy
condemning black apathy as it did damning white indifference. Articles called for
the Union to place less emphasis on its role as a social group and more on social
awareness.
In the list of demands released Monday, the BSU again demonsuated concern
for all minorities. "Black student demands are not to be placed in competition
with the expressed needs of other people of color," one read. And for the first
time in months, the BSU is putting strong pressure on the Administration to act
on its proposals.
The Black Students Union made Stanford somewhat more aware to the needs
and sensibilities of minority communities. When it seemed necessary, it has
prodded the Administration. This month, after a long silence, it appears to be
returning to the vanguard.

lily - white institution, that it shall not be ignorant of or insensitive to the needs
of minority communities."
Stanford did not spontaneously develop a social conscience. Only 70 black
students were enrolled here three years ago, on April 4,1968, the day that Martin
Luther King was assasinated. Calls for more black admissions met with a familiar
response. There just weren't any more qualified candidates.
The death of King spurred the University to produce a "Response to Racism."
Stanford's immediate answer to racism was not an active program to recruit black
students. It consisted of a daylong colloquium. However, the administration did
give some concessions. Provost Lyman announced that students should feel free
not to attend classes in order to participate in the day's activities.
At this point, the shit hit the fan. In the middle of Lyman's speech at the
program in Memorial Auditorium, black student Ken Washington seized the
microphone and shouted for the audience of 1 700 whites, to "Put your money
where your mouth is!" Frank Satterwhite read a long list of demands on black
admissions. Then 70 blacks walked out of Memorial Auditorium to a standing
ovation.
Prompt Reply
Within seven hours, President Wallace Sterling issued a reply to the BSU
demands. The pledge for action included doubling minority enrollment by 1969 -
1 9 70, doubling the proportion of minority employees in one year, and most
importantly, the admission of 10 minority students "who do not meet minimal
academic requirements."
Two years later, nine of these ten students were enrolled and in good academic
standing. The myth of "no qualified applicants" was shattered and the bias of the
University's admission requirements exposed.
Relations between the Administration and the BSU has run hot and cold since
April, 1 968. Generally negotiations were conducted quietly, but flare-ups
occurred. On Feb. 21, 1969, President Pitzer was scheduled to meet with BSU
leaders over a list of 12 demands. Due to an apparent misunderstanding, he failed
to show, and later that afternoon some 15 angry blacks rampaged through the
bookstore, causing damages in excess of $1,000.
Since that time the BSU has been a comparatively quiescent organization, with
white radical groups such as Off-ROTC and Venceremos assuming the mantle of
campus militancy. Twice successful in electing slates to the ASSU Senate, the BSU
is privately viewed by radicals as having been co-opted. MECHA, (a chicano
student group) charged last spring that the BSU is less concerned with defending
the rights of all Third World peoples than with protecting a student fee allotment
of over $8,000.
Time of Searching
Perhaps for this reason, fall quarter seemed to be a time of self-searching for
the BSU. Its remodled newspaper, The Real News, spent as much copy
condemning black apathy as it did damning white indifference. Articles called for
the Union to place less emphasis on its role as a social group and more on social
awareness.
In the list of demands released Monday, the BSU again demonsuated concern
for all minorities. "Black student demands are not to be placed in competition
with the expressed needs of other people of color," one read. And for the first
time in months, the BSU is putting strong pressure on the Administration to act
on its proposals.
The Black Students Union made Stanford somewhat more aware to the needs
and sensibilities of minority communities. When it seemed necessary, it has
prodded the Administration. This month, after a long silence, it appears to be
returning to the vanguard.
President Lyman pledged Monday his strong "personal and institutional
commitment to follow the path set out in 1968 to the end that this shall not be a
lily - white institution, that it shall not be ignorant of or insensitive to the needs
of minority communities."
