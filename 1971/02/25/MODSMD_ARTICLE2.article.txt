# BSU: Newly Revived Center Of Activism
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT News Analysis 
President Lyman pledged Monday his strong "personal and institutional
commitment to follow the path set out in 1968 to the end that this shall not be a
lily - white institution, that it shall not be ignorant of or insensitive to the needs
of minority communities."
Stanford did not spontaneously develop a social conscience. Only 70 black
students were enrolled here three years ago, on April 4,1968, the day that Martin
Luther King was assasinated. Calls for more black admissions met with a familiar
response. There just weren't any more qualified candidates.
The death of King spurred the University to produce a "Response to Racism."
Stanford's immediate answer to racism was not an active program to recruit black
students. It consisted of a daylong colloquium. However, the administration did
give some concessions. Provost Lyman announced that students should feel free
not to attend classes in order to participate in the day's activities.
At this point, the shit hit the fan. In the middle of Lyman's speech at the
program in Memorial Auditorium, black student Ken Washington seized the
microphone and shouted for the audience of 1 700 whites, to "Put your money
where your mouth is!" Frank Satterwhite read a long list of demands on black
admissions. Then 70 blacks walked out of Memorial Auditorium to a standing
ovation.
Prompt Reply
Within seven hours, President Wallace Sterling issued a reply to the BSU
demands. The pledge for action included doubling minority enrollment by 1969 -
1 9 70, doubling the proportion of minority employees in one year, and most
importantly, the admission of 10 minority students "who do not meet minimal
academic requirements."
Two years later, nine of these ten students were enrolled and in good academic
standing. The myth of "no qualified applicants" was shattered and the bias of the
University's admission requirements exposed.
Relations between the Administration and the BSU has run hot and cold since
April, 1 968. Generally negotiations were conducted quietly, but flare-ups
