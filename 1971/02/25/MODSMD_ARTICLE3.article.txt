# Liberals Seeking Arrest Block Induction Center
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Four University professors, three
ministers, an administrative head of
SLAC, and a former aerospace engineer
blocked the entrances to the San Mateo
Selective Services offices all day
yesterday in a protest against the
Indochinese war.
They were unsuccessful in their
avowed attempt to be arrested; they
hope to construct a case against the war
in court.
The nine would-be arrestees include
Robert McAfee Brown, professor of
Religion; Sanford M. Dornbusch,
professor of Sociology and the present
chairman of the Academic Senate; and
Paul F. Garrett, a former aerospace
engineer.
Also, John L. Kelley, professor of
Mathematics; Father Kenneth
Keulman, associate pastor of the Most
Holy Trinity Church in San Jose; and
Robert H. Moulton, Jr., associate
director of Administrative Services at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
Also, B. Davie Napier, dean of the
Chapel and professor of Religion; Reb.
Louis H. Riley, associate minister of
the First Congregational Church in Palo
Alto; and Rev. George M. Wilson, First
Presbyterian Church, in Palo Alto.
No Attempt To Arrest
The nine began blocking the
entrances to Local Boards 57 and 58 at
about 10:00 a.m. and left at 4:30 in
the afternoon. San Mateo city police
did not attempt to arrest any of the
protesters during the blockade,
although they were fully informed of
the situation.
A police statement said that the
demonstration was "of no concern to
them," and that the draft boards had
"not asked them to do anything." No
formal complaint was made by
Selective Service officials, although at
least 35 people were prevented from
entering the offices—one, an army
recruiting officer.
After the protesters ended their
demonstration, Professor Brown
declared, "We're going back—we're not
saying when." He added, "What we
expected to be a symbolic act turned
out to be a genuine one, well worth
being done."
A small group, mostly newsmen
from television stations in the Bay area,
photographers, and newspaper
reporters, watched the peaceful protest
for the first three hours.
The nine protesters, aided by
students from Columbae House,
distributed personal and group
statements concerning their actions of
protest.
Group Statement
The group statement declared, "This
morning we are engaged in a
non-violent act, Working access to a
draft board. We expect to be arrested,
and we will not resist arrest."
The anti-war protest has the avowed
intention of "raising constitutional
issues" in the hoped-for trial.

"Even if we are found guilty," read
the group statement, "we will at least
have provided vivid testimony to the
despair so many people feel about the
course of events and the distortion of
our political tradition . . . We have an
inescapable duty to express our moral
anguish."
Shopowners in an auto parts shop
across the street from the
demonstrators expressed support for
the action. George Lachner, a
Conscientious Objector during World
War 11, said "I believe they're doing the
right thing.
"A demonstration once on Ash
Wednesday once a year won't do it, but
it we have a little (protest) here and a
little there, we will do it.
"They should do it every day,"he
added.
One of those who attempted to
enter the center, Sergeant Richard
Fitting, seemed, after some initial
annoyance, mildly amused at the affair.
He had arranged to take a small
number of inductees up to the Oakland
Induction Center, but after being
unable to gain access to either the front

or the back gate of ine center, he wern
across the street, called Oakland to say
he would not be coming, and remained
on the other side of the street,
observing the continuing protest.
Double Standard
The nine protesters and their
supporters appeared visibly disturbed at
the police decision not to make arrests.
"What they are doing (the protesters) is
clearly an illegal act—blocking access to
a federal building," declared a woman
bystander. "Unfortunately what we're
seeing is the double standard of the
law; police apply it when they want
to."
"Frankly, we're being intentionally
ignored," noted Dean Napier. "You
know very well that if nine black kids
from East Palo Alto staged this protest
they would be ripped off inside of
seconds—and charged with felonies,"
rejoined a sympathetic bystander.
Professor John Kaplan of the Law
School told the Daily yesterday that
the police were probably well aware of
the nature of the illegal blockade—but
were under no constraints to arrest any
of the peaceful protesters.
