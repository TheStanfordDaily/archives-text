News Analysis
The suspension of Associate English Professor
H. Bruce Franklin and President Lyman's
proposal to have Franklin dismissed from the
Stanford faculty have been described by the
University News Service as "the most serious
disciplinary actions brought against a faculty
member since the early 1 9 00's."
In addition to being uniquely severe sanctions,
Franklin's suspension and possible dismissal have
again raised some important questions about the
power and effectiveness of the Stanford judicial
machinery.
Sixty years ago the issue that led to the
dismissal of a Stanford English Professor was an
affair the professor was having with another
faculty member's wife. Franklin's cast 1 is more
difficult to define.
He is charged with an alleged violation of the
Statement of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
at Stanford University. Specifically, Lyman has
suspended Franklin under article 1 7 of the six
page document. That article reads: "Suspension
of a faculty member is justified only if
immediate harm to himself or others is
threatened by his continuance in his regular
duties."
This means, in Lyman's opinion, that to have
Franklin teach his class on American Literature
of the 1 930's and to participate as a member of
the English department faculty poses a threat to
some other members of the University
community.
"Threat" To Others
In his letter to Franklin notifying him of the
suspension, Lyman briefly outlined the reasons
that he considers Franklin to be a "threat."
"Because of the important role which you
played in the tragic events of Wednesday, Feb.
10," the letter read, "1 regard your continuance

in your regular duties to constitute a threat of
immediate harm to others."
Some faculty members however, have
questioned the connection Lyman has made
between Franklin's words and actions that
evening, and the shootings and beatings that
occurred the same night. Stanford's Nobel
prize-winning chemist, Linus Pauling
commented, "The suspension is an extraordinary
and un precedented violation of the principles of
academic freedom and individual rights, a really
dangerous introduction of authoritarianism into
the University."
English professor Ronald Rebholz commented
on Pauling's statement saying, "Pauling's position
is powerful and may indeed be right. I don't
think Lyman is a villian. It is just that in his
reading of the evidence he found Bruce's actions
to be unsafe. My reading of the evidence says
that it was not necessary to suspend him."
Professor Franklin himself emphatically
denies any connection between his actions and
the shootings or beatings. "I don't understand
what involvement in 'tragic events on Feb. 10th'
Lyman is getting at," Franklin said Tuesday. "I
have no idea who did the shootings or what
prompted them. In fact I haven't even received a
list of the charges against me that led to my
suspension."
Urged And Incited
Even more ambiguity surrounds the
procedural Iwsis for President Lyman's effort to
dismiss Franklin from the faculty. Quoting
almost verbatim from the Appointment and
Tenure policy, the President outlined the reasons
he will seek to have the English professor
dismissed.
"You have urged, incited, and led Stanford
students and others to interfere with the
operations of the University," Lyman wrote to
Franklin two weeks ago, "and in iny judgement

this conduct represents a gross impairment of the
performance of your appropriate functions
within the University community."
The key phrase in this statement is "a gross
impairment of the performance of your
appropriate functions within the University."
There is some question as to whether or not
Franklin's appropriate duties at Stanford have, in
fact, been impaired in the last month.
If for example, appropriate duties are defined
as the teaching of his class, it is difficult to see
any change in Franklin's performance as a
professor.
Bunch Of People
"Technically," English Department Chairman
lan Watt said, "Bruce's class isn't meeting at the
present time and he is not teaching any class. But
the fact of the matter is, at 1:15 p.m. on the
prescribed days a bunch of people attend talks
by Professor Franklin just like the class was going
on as usual."
Franklin insists that his duties as a teacher
have not been impaired in any way during the
past month. "I have said again and again that I
feel 1 have a responsibility to the students to
teach my classes," he said," and I also have a
contractual arrangement with the University and
I have a duty to uphold that."
Today is the deadline set by Lyman for
Franklin to request a hearing of his case before
the Faculty Advisory Board. This board is the
body prescribed in the Appointment and Tenure
statement to hear cases of dismissal.
Vague Accusations
Franklin said last night that he has drafted a
response to Lyman's "vague accusations of my
participation in an illegal event," but declined to
say whether or not he would formally request a
hearing in front of the Advisory Board.
"The attempt is being made to ban from the
campus all people that resist learning how to kill

people," Franklin said in an earlier interview,
"and because I have advocated resistance, they
are trying to dismiss me. The question is not
whether or not I will respond to the Advisory
Board but whether or not I will respond to the
sort of Catch-2 2 clause that Lyman has tried to
impose to stop me from doing things he doesn't
want me to do."
James Siena, Legal Advisor to the President
said that "anything Professor Franklin does
today that could be reasonably interpreted as a
request for a hearing we will construe as such."
When asked what would happen if Franklin
did not request a hearing, Siena said, "I really
don't know what we will do. We haven't faced
that question squarely."
Never Before
Since there has never been a case brought
before the Advisory Board concerning the
dismissal of a professor, and since no other
president in recent times has deemed it necessary
to enact the suspension and dismissal clause of
the Appointment and Tenure Policy, there is no
way of knowing whether or not the President has
the power to dismiss a faculty member without
hearing before the Advisory Board.
Watt summed up the confusion over the
powers of the Advisory Board saying, "Nobody,
when they drew up the legal and disciplinary
codes in this University, had any notion they
would be called on to deal with the kind of issues
that we are dealing with now." News Service
Director, Bob Beyers added, "The procedures
being applied in this case have never really been
tested before."
It is inevitable that in coming weeks the
University disciplinary apparatus will be in for its
first functional test in more than half a century.
What is unclear however, is whether or not that
apparatus is well enough defined to satisfactorily
deal with the issues involved in Franklin's case.
