# administration's test of strength
## Dismissal Of Bruce Franklin 
### 
The dismissal of a tenured
professor is a grave and
extraordinary event in any
university. Yet, like the invasion
of Laos, President Lyman's
proposal to dismiss Bruce
Franklin has elicited very little
public protest, and perhaps for
much the same reasons. I write
these words because of my
conviction that the faculty (but
not the faculty alone, though it is
most directly concerned) must
assume responsibility and involve
themselves in this action, rather
than keeping our distance from
the action, as bemused and futile
observers.
It is clear that for years Bruce
Franklin has been a source of
acute embarrassment to
Stanford's leadership, attracting
the wrath of government officials,
trustees, alumni, press and
assorted citizens all over. He has
offended because of the image he
projected, but also—perhaps even
more important—because he has
been an eloquent and effective
leader of movements to protest
and to combat various aspects of
Stanford's involvement in the war
in Indochina. He has, in fact,
made himself so conspicuous as to

achieve almost symbolic status
and also to expose himself to that
kind of selective prosecution
about which politically active
students at Stanford have
complained for years.
It also seems clear to me that
the administration has felt it must
rise to a test of strength and prove
to its constituents that it can
impose order on the campus. I
sympathize with their desire for
public confidence, but not with
the way they are going about
getting it. There have been many
opportunities lost for asserting
moral leadership here and getting
the university out of the war
business. Others are always at
hand or can be created. But
leadership we respect will not be
achieved by the persecution of
the man who, more than anyone
else, has had the courage and
steadfastness to speak out loudly
and clearly on all the causes and
issues about which the
administration has, with very few
exceptions, remained stubbornly
mute.
What I believe the faculty (and
others) must question closely is
the relationship between what he
actually has said and done, on the

one hand, and, on the other, the
events with which he has been
rhetorically associated (like
shooting and bombings and
bloody revolution and civil war),
the kind of action (legal and
otherwise) undertaken against him
and the kind of penalties that are
being proposed. We have to ask
ourselves whether, if Henry Cabot
Lodge had sued Franklin for
infringement of his right to free
speech, or if the University had
taken legal action against him for
disturbance of the peace, Franklin
would have been subject to loss of
three months' income, that is, a
fine of several thousand dollars.
The threat of outright dismissal
really strikes at the heart of what
tenure should be all about in a
university, namely, protection of
a professor's right not to be fired
for expressing his political views.
Franklin's views seem to favor
revolution, and this frightens
people; it also disturbs people
who fear loud and constant
expression of those views will hurt
the University financially But we
all have to see clearly that the
firing of Bruce Franklin is not an
act of repression and injustice for
him, but an action that will surely
lead to diminished freedom for us
all.
I say that if the University
administration believes that
criminal acts have been
committed, it is doubtless their
responsibility to inform the
appropriate civil authorities and
to allow the law to take its course.
If they do not, they should let the
man alone.
