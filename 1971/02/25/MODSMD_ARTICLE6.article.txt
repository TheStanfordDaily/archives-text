An uneasy silence has fallen on the
campus. Memories of the mid-quarter
peak of violence are fading, while the
presence of the new temporary
restraining order is still very much on
people's minds.
However, a number of voices have
broken through this silence to either
praise or condemn President Lyman's
decision to summarily suspend associate
English professor H. Bruce Franklin,
and to recommend his dismissal to the
Advisory Board. Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling has termed the suspension "an
extraordinary and unprecedented
violation of the principles of academic
freedom and individual rights— a really
dangerous introduction of
authoritarianism into the University."
Pauling's description of the action as
extraordinary and unprecedented is
certainly accurate and, upon
examination, it seems clear that the
suspension, as an academic punishment,
is an abridgement of the rights of an
extremely controversial professor -just
the type of individual whose freedoms
the University should go out of its way

to protect.
This is not to say, however, that the
University should protect any individual
who advocates or takes part in violence
to other human beings. If any member
of the University community is
suspected of this action, evidence
should be gathered and the appropriate
charges brought against the individual in
civil or criminal courts. To levy
academic sanctions on Franklin, to keep
him out of his classroom, seems at best
to be an extremely misdirected effort at
calming a troubled community, and at
worst an act of repression.
It is necessary, therefore, to
understand the justification behind
Franklin's penalty. One clause of the
Statement of Policy on Appointment
and Tenure condones such a sanction
only if "immediate harm to (the
individual) or others is threatened by his
continuance in his regular duties."
If these duties are to be defined
simply as the basics of a professor's job -
instruction, research and scholarship,
then it would be fairly simply to
document a professor's laxness in or

neglect of his "regular duties." There is,
however, another set of duties which a
professor must undertake - those of a
member of what has often been termed
the "Academic Community." Only the
broadest of generalities are in force
here. A member of an academic
community must maintain the
community as an open forum.
Infringements of academic freedom
must not be permitted on a University
campus - but the way to punish these
infringements is not to infringe those
same rights for one individual. If it can
be proven before an appropriate body
that Franklin did indeed violate the
principles of freedom of speech and if
his actions or exhortations did
constitute an immediate danger to other
individuals, then he should be punished
- either through the civil courts or
through fines levied by the University.
But attempts to curtail his freedom to
teach are not the answer-they only
constitute more of the same repression
of the basic freedoms which the
University is supposedly trying to
eliminate. •

violation of the principles of academic
freedom and individual rights— a really
dangerous introduction of
authoritarianism into the University."
Pauling's description of the action as
extraordinary and unprecedented is
certainly accurate and, upon
examination, it seems clear that the
suspension, as an academic punishment,
is an abridgement of the rights of an
extremely controversial professor -just
the type of individual whose freedoms
the University should go out of its way

to protect.
This is not to say, however, that the
University should protect any individual
who advocates or takes part in violence
to other human beings. If any member
of the University community is
suspected of this action, evidence
should be gathered and the appropriate
charges brought against the individual in
civil or criminal courts. To levy
academic sanctions on Franklin, to keep
him out of his classroom, seems at best
to be an extremely misdirected effort at
calming a troubled community, and at
worst an act of repression.
It is necessary, therefore, to
understand the justification behind
Franklin's penalty. One clause of the
Statement of Policy on Appointment
and Tenure condones such a sanction
only if "immediate harm to (the
individual) or others is threatened by his
continuance in his regular duties."
If these duties are to be defined
simply as the basics of a professor's job -
instruction, research and scholarship,
then it would be fairly simply to
document a professor's laxness in or

neglect of his "regular duties." There is,
however, another set of duties which a
professor must undertake - those of a
member of what has often been termed
the "Academic Community." Only the
broadest of generalities are in force
here. A member of an academic
community must maintain the
community as an open forum.
Infringements of academic freedom
must not be permitted on a University
campus - but the way to punish these
infringements is not to infringe those
same rights for one individual. If it can
be proven before an appropriate body
that Franklin did indeed violate the
principles of freedom of speech and if
his actions or exhortations did
constitute an immediate danger to other
individuals, then he should be punished
- either through the civil courts or
through fines levied by the University.
But attempts to curtail his freedom to
teach are not the answer-they only
constitute more of the same repression
of the basic freedoms which the
University is supposedly trying to
eliminate. •
An uneasy silence has fallen on the
campus. Memories of the mid-quarter
peak of violence are fading, while the
presence of the new temporary
restraining order is still very much on
people's minds.
However, a number of voices have
broken through this silence to either
praise or condemn President Lyman's
decision to summarily suspend associate
English professor H. Bruce Franklin,
and to recommend his dismissal to the
Advisory Board. Nobel Laureate Linus
Pauling has termed the suspension "an
extraordinary and unprecedented
violation of the principles of academic
freedom and individual rights— a really
dangerous introduction of
authoritarianism into the University."
