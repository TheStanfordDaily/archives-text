two contracts
Editor, THE DAILY:
I write to correct certain errors
which appeared in Friday's Daily
regarding two contracts held by
the University with the Federal
Government.
In one case, the article said
that Professor Noyes stated that
an alleged CIA contract was held

by the University until 1969, was
directed by Professor Rambo, and
that the fact of its existence was
concealed.
Our records indicate there were
two contracts where the identity
of the sponsor was unknown to
me. They were under the general
direction of Professor Rambo; on
one the research was completed in
June of 1964 ; on the other in

June of 1966. (I called Professor
Noyes Friday and he believes he
said 1966, n0t1969.)
The Academic Council Policy
on Classified Research was passed
in the fall of 1967, fifteen months
after the research was completed
on the last of these contracts.
There have been no such contracts
since.
As to the matter of security
clearance for Business School
professors to participate in the
forming of a Peruvian business
school, the requirement by AID
was initiated with the Business
School outside the contract, and
my office didn't become aware of
it until the fall of 1967, at which
time I reported it to the then
Committee on Research Policy,
and we informed AID that we
would discontinue unless this
requirement was lifted, which it
subsequently was. The contract
recently expired.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Prof. Noyes was quoted in the
Daily of February 19 th as saying
that "all faculty members were
required to have security
clearance to operate a school in
Peru - a project run by the
Business School here."
In order to set the record
straight, I wish to make these
statements of fact:
1. From June 1968 through
June 1970 I was in Lima, Peru,
and connected with ESAN (the
project, I believe, to which you
are referring.)
2. From June 1968 until
February 1970 I was acting dean
and "chief of party" for Stanford.
3. On February 1, 1970 a
Peruvian dean was installed. From
that date until my departure I
acted solely in the capacity of
"academic advisor."
4. Before going to Peru, I
learned that a security clearance
was optional. I opted for it.
5. During my stay, no U.S.
or/other country visiting professor,
short or long term, had a security
clearance nor were any asked to
obtain one.
6. Effective January 1, 1970,
Stanford has no formal or any
other contractual arrangement
with the U.S. government, the
Peruvian government, or ESAN,
relative to the operation of Esan.

In your front-page story of

"Marchers Pickets To Protest
Way," your paper stated
" . . . Pacific Studies
Center . . . and other autonomous
organizations make up CAWI"
(Coalition Against the War in
Indochina).
Pacific Studies Center—PSC) is
indeed an autonomous
organization, but, striving to be a
non-profit corporation dedicated
to research and education, Pacific
Studies Center does not engage in
joining or in "making up" any
organization that is not explicity
non-profit and exclusively
dedicated to research and
educational purposes.

The Academic Council Policy
on Classified Research was passed
in the fall of 1967, fifteen months
after the research was completed
on the last of these contracts.
There have been no such contracts
since.
As to the matter of security
clearance for Business School
professors to participate in the
forming of a Peruvian business
school, the requirement by AID
was initiated with the Business
School outside the contract, and
my office didn't become aware of
it until the fall of 1967, at which
time I reported it to the then
Committee on Research Policy,
and we informed AID that we
would discontinue unless this
requirement was lifted, which it
subsequently was. The contract
recently expired.

Prof. Noyes was quoted in the
Daily of February 19 th as saying
that "all faculty members were
required to have security
clearance to operate a school in
Peru - a project run by the
Business School here."
In order to set the record
straight, I wish to make these
statements of fact:
1. From June 1968 through
June 1970 I was in Lima, Peru,
and connected with ESAN (the
project, I believe, to which you
are referring.)
2. From June 1968 until
February 1970 I was acting dean
and "chief of party" for Stanford.
3. On February 1, 1970 a
Peruvian dean was installed. From
that date until my departure I
acted solely in the capacity of
"academic advisor."
4. Before going to Peru, I
learned that a security clearance
was optional. I opted for it.
5. During my stay, no U.S.
or/other country visiting professor,
short or long term, had a security
clearance nor were any asked to
obtain one.
6. Effective January 1, 1970,
Stanford has no formal or any
other contractual arrangement
with the U.S. government, the
Peruvian government, or ESAN,
relative to the operation of Esan.

In your front-page story of

"Marchers Pickets To Protest
Way," your paper stated
" . . . Pacific Studies
Center . . . and other autonomous
organizations make up CAWI"
(Coalition Against the War in
Indochina).
Pacific Studies Center—PSC) is
indeed an autonomous
organization, but, striving to be a
non-profit corporation dedicated
to research and education, Pacific
Studies Center does not engage in
joining or in "making up" any
organization that is not explicity
non-profit and exclusively
dedicated to research and
educational purposes.
Since we in no way limit the
outside activities of PSC members,
one or more members of PSC may
be involved with CAWI; PSC is
not.

I write to correct certain errors
which appeared in Friday's Daily
regarding two contracts held by
the University with the Federal
Government.
In one case, the article said
that Professor Noyes stated that
an alleged CIA contract was held

by the University until 1969, was
directed by Professor Rambo, and
that the fact of its existence was
concealed.
Our records indicate there were
two contracts where the identity
of the sponsor was unknown to
me. They were under the general
direction of Professor Rambo; on
one the research was completed in
June of 1964 ; on the other in

June of 1966. (I called Professor
Noyes Friday and he believes he
said 1966, n0t1969.)
