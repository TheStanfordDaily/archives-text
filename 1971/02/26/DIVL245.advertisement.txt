This morning and this
afternoon, recruiters from the
Ordance Division of FMC
Corporation, which holds
major contracts with the U.S.
Defense Department, will be
at the Placement Center. The
New Left Project, in
conjunction with various
non-violent radicals and
liberals has called a 12:45
demonstration against this
recruiting activity and FMC's
munitions manufacturing.
This anti-FMC group has
collected several hundred
signatures on petitions asking
that Stanford bar FMC from
using University facilities.
