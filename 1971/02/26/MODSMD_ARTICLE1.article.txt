## Franklin Demands To See Charges 
### 
Associate English professor H. Bruce
Franklin, threatened with dismissal
from the Stanford faculty, declined
yesterday to request a hearing before
the Faculty Advisory Board on the
grounds that President Lyman has not
yet informed him of the charges against
him.
In a letter to Lyman, Franklin
claimed that procedures outlined in
Paragraph 15 of the Statement of
Policy on Appointment and Tenure
(Franklin is charged with violation of
Article 17) were not followed in his
case. Specifically, Franklin charged that
Paragraph 15 provides that "the
individual shall first be notified
(confidentially, if possible) of the
charges against him and given an
opportunity to reply." Franklin claims
that before he received a copy of the
letter on February 12 informing him of

his suspension and proposed dismissal,
the contents of the letter were released
to the press.
In his February 12 letter to Franklin,
Lyman wrote, "You have on several
occasions since then (the Lodge speech)
urged, incited and led Stanford
students and others to interfere with
the operations of the University and
conduct themselves in an unlawful
manner, and have yourself so acted,
most notably on Wednesday, February
10,1971."
According to Franklin, the letter
from Lyman does not constitute a
statement of charges since the letter
names no specific incidents and no
specific occasions, nor does it specify
what kind of interference with the
operations of the University. Franklin
has allegedly "urged, incited and led."
Franklin claims that the charges

brought against him are so vague that
they could be easily brought against
"every member of the faculty who last
spring voted for a strike and
participated in it."
In addition to charging that the
University is conducting his trial and
convicting him in the press, Franklin
demanded that Lyman inform him
precisely what the charges are against
him, other than, he added, "being a
revolutionary wholly dedicated to
destroying the political, economic, and
cultural of your entire
class..." *â€¢
Lyman told the Daily last night that
he had not yet received a copy of the
letter. He had no comment on what
steps might next be taken in the
Franklin case. The statement of Policy
on Appointment and Tenure does not
specify any procedure in the event that

a faculty member does not request a
hearing.
Franklin lists two primary reasons
why he cannot request a hearing
without knowing the specific charges
against him. First, the "accusations
may be of such shameful acts, given
existing taboos, that the individual does
not want a hearing."
The second reason is that because
"technical rules of legal evidence need
not be strictly applied" if he were
charged with a serious criminal offense
"it might be extremely dangerous to
have the kind of mock trial represented
by an Advisory Board hearing."
Franklin goes on to say "this
possibility is not so fantastical" given
the shootings which occured the night
of Feb. 10, and he suggests that the
University may be alleging that the
"unlawful acts I have urged, incited and
led include attempted murder."
