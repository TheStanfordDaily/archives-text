# Faculty Political Statement -Part III

(This is the third and
concluding part of the Faculty
Political Action Group
statement.)
GOVERNANCE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
Governing bodies of the
University should reflect and
represent the composition of the
University. In general, members of
governing bodies should be
selected by the governed
constituency and not be
self-appointed. The diversity of
individuals involved in University
function should be reflected in
governing bodies; this will assist in
assuring maximum access of new
ideas concerning University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing councils of the
University wherever policy
influences the staff. It is proposed
that:
1) The staff shall be organized
into a representative organization
similar to the Senates of student
and faculty and a coordinating
committee between the three
bodies shall be established.
2) The trustees shall be
considered to be a community
supervising and overseeing body.
They shall be re-organized to be
representative of the different
components of the mid-California
community; thus their
composition will include not only
some who are associated with
business and industry but also
educators, trade unionists, local
government officials, agricultural
workers, and minority
representatives with substantially
increased proportions of youth
and women.
3) The new Board of Trustees
shall have representatives
participating in the three Senates
in the University, and conversely

these bodies shall have permanent
representatives to the trustees.
4) An alternative to the above
proposals should be carefully
examined. The alternative is
organization of a form of
municipal government for the
University community. As the
University has grown in
population, activities and
influence upon the community,
policy decisions of a classical
institutional nature become
political decisions of great
importance for the University
community. It has become more
important to create a local
government which derives from
the concent of the governed and
which guarantees the basic rights
of all citizens to members of the
University community. It would
therefore be wise to consider
separating community
government from academic
government...
...Problems encountered in
democratic self-government
systems include lack of
participation by a significant
number of constituents, a
tendency of some individuals to
hold multiple positions, and thus
a tendency toward homogeneity
of ideas. A mechanism is needed
which will provide a continuous
source of representatives who
enter the governmental system
without prior commitment and
obligation of a political nature
and who will steadily enlarge
participation in governance by a
constituency. It is proposed that:
1 ) Representatives to
University governing bodies be
selected by two mechanisms. The
first will be standard election
techniques which will provide a
majority of representatives in any
given body. The second will be a
lottery which will select a few
representatives at random from
the entire constituency.
2) No individual member of
this faculty will hold more than
one major elected post or one
appointment to a major governing
body at any given time.

RESEARCH POLICY
Scholarly research is an
essential component of
development of knowledge and of
an educational system. Research
broadens understanding and is one
of the central means whereby a
university can benefit society. The
intent of research programs
derives both from the interests of
scholars and from the needs of
society. An appropriate university
research policy safeguards the
right of individual faculty and
students to study in a scholarly
way that which interests them and
ensures that the needs of society,
as understood by the University
community, are introduced into
the patterns of research. In the
past, Stanford research policy has
adequately accomplished the first
goal of freedom for scholarly
inquiry but has very inadequately
reflected the pressing issues
confronting society. Examples of
neglected areas have already been
indicated (Section III, paragraph
1). It is the responsibility of this
University to seek and define new
research programs which will
redress the existing imbalance, to
develop alternative support for
new programs through both
public and private sources, and to
use new programs as examples to

persuade the Federal Government
to broaden its support of research
programs derived from local and
regional needs. It is therefore
proposed that:
1) The University Research
Committee shall be enlarged
through the addition of faculty
and students from each major
discipline and shall be charged
specifically with the responsibility
of developing new research
programs. While University
departments themselves shall
retain ultimate authority to
accept or reject new programs and
to hire needed faculty, the
Research Committee shall serve as
a development arm and public
forum for both general and
specific proposals within the
University.
2) The University Research
Committee shall appoint a series
of Citizen Advisory Councils
consisting of individuals from the
community who would contribute
most to the design and
implementation of research
programs at Stanford.
3) The Research Committee
shall be informed of all existing
and new research programs within
the University, shall make this
information publicly available,
and shall have the authority to
make proposals concerning

modification of existing and
development of new plans.
However, the Research
Committee shall not have veto
authority over programs or
proposals of individual faculty
members or departments.
4) Stanford University,
through the Research Committee,
shall work with other universities
and citizens' groups at the local
and national level to accomplish
an alteration of national priorities
so that social needs will achieve
greater attention, to assign
responsibility for scientific and
social research away from the
military into other governmental
agencies, and to extend the
practice of review of research
proposals by peer groups to these
other agencies.
5) The University Research
Committee shall re-examine the
desirability of establishing or
supporting a separate research
institute to conduct applied
research on social problems.
Advantages of such a separate
institution would include easier
participation of non-University
personnel in such research and
development programs and would
reduce the needs for the
University to expand its regular
faculty to accomplish some of the
research goals.

in the University, and conversely

these bodies shall have permanent
representatives to the trustees.
4) An alternative to the above
proposals should be carefully
examined. The alternative is
organization of a form of
municipal government for the
University community. As the
University has grown in
population, activities and
influence upon the community,
policy decisions of a classical
institutional nature become
political decisions of great
importance for the University
community. It has become more
important to create a local
government which derives from
the concent of the governed and
which guarantees the basic rights
of all citizens to members of the
University community. It would
therefore be wise to consider
separating community
government from academic
government...
...Problems encountered in
democratic self-government
systems include lack of
participation by a significant
number of constituents, a
tendency of some individuals to
hold multiple positions, and thus
a tendency toward homogeneity
of ideas. A mechanism is needed
which will provide a continuous
source of representatives who
enter the governmental system
without prior commitment and
obligation of a political nature
and who will steadily enlarge
participation in governance by a
constituency. It is proposed that:
1 ) Representatives to
University governing bodies be
selected by two mechanisms. The
first will be standard election
techniques which will provide a
majority of representatives in any
given body. The second will be a
lottery which will select a few
representatives at random from
the entire constituency.
2) No individual member of
this faculty will hold more than
one major elected post or one
appointment to a major governing
body at any given time.

RESEARCH POLICY
Scholarly research is an
essential component of
development of knowledge and of
an educational system. Research
broadens understanding and is one
of the central means whereby a
university can benefit society. The
intent of research programs
derives both from the interests of
scholars and from the needs of
society. An appropriate university
research policy safeguards the
right of individual faculty and
students to study in a scholarly
way that which interests them and
ensures that the needs of society,
as understood by the University
community, are introduced into
the patterns of research. In the
past, Stanford research policy has
adequately accomplished the first
goal of freedom for scholarly
inquiry but has very inadequately
reflected the pressing issues
confronting society. Examples of
neglected areas have already been
indicated (Section III, paragraph
1). It is the responsibility of this
University to seek and define new
research programs which will
redress the existing imbalance, to
develop alternative support for
new programs through both
public and private sources, and to
use new programs as examples to

persuade the Federal Government
to broaden its support of research
programs derived from local and
regional needs. It is therefore
proposed that:
1) The University Research
Committee shall be enlarged
through the addition of faculty
and students from each major
discipline and shall be charged
specifically with the responsibility
of developing new research
programs. While University
departments themselves shall
retain ultimate authority to
accept or reject new programs and
to hire needed faculty, the
Research Committee shall serve as
a development arm and public
forum for both general and
specific proposals within the
University.
2) The University Research
Committee shall appoint a series
of Citizen Advisory Councils
consisting of individuals from the
community who would contribute
most to the design and
implementation of research
programs at Stanford.
3) The Research Committee
shall be informed of all existing
and new research programs within
the University, shall make this
information publicly available,
and shall have the authority to
make proposals concerning

modification of existing and
development of new plans.
However, the Research
Committee shall not have veto
authority over programs or
proposals of individual faculty
members or departments.
4) Stanford University,
through the Research Committee,
shall work with other universities
and citizens' groups at the local
and national level to accomplish
an alteration of national priorities
so that social needs will achieve
greater attention, to assign
responsibility for scientific and
social research away from the
military into other governmental
agencies, and to extend the
practice of review of research
proposals by peer groups to these
other agencies.
5) The University Research
Committee shall re-examine the
desirability of establishing or
supporting a separate research
institute to conduct applied
research on social problems.
Advantages of such a separate
institution would include easier
participation of non-University
personnel in such research and
development programs and would
reduce the needs for the
University to expand its regular
faculty to accomplish some of the
research goals.

concluding part of the Faculty
Political Action Group
statement.)
GOVERNANCE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
Governing bodies of the
University should reflect and

University. In general, members of
governing bodies should be
selected by the governed
constituency and not be
self-appointed. The diversity of
individuals involved in University
function should be reflected in
governing bodies; this will assist in
assuring maximum access of new
ideas concerning University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing councils of the
University wherever policy
influences the staff. It is proposed
that:
1) The staff shall be organized
into a representative organization
similar to the Senates of student
and faculty and a coordinating
committee between the three
bodies shall be established.
2) The trustees shall be
considered to be a community
supervising and overseeing body.
They shall be re-organized to be
representative of the different
components of the mid-California
community; thus their
composition will include not only
some who are associated with
business and industry but also
educators, trade unionists, local
government officials, agricultural
workers, and minority
representatives with substantially
increased proportions of youth
and women.
3) The new Board of Trustees
shall have representatives
participating in the three Senates

these bodies shall have permanent

one major elected post or one

RESEARCH POLICY
Scholarly research is an
essential component of
development of knowledge and of
an educational system. Research
broadens understanding and is one
of the central means whereby a
university can benefit society. The
intent of research programs
derives both from the interests of
scholars and from the needs of
society. An appropriate university
research policy safeguards the
right of individual faculty and
students to study in a scholarly
way that which interests them and
ensures that the needs of society,
as understood by the University
community, are introduced into
the patterns of research. In the
past, Stanford research policy has
adequately accomplished the first
goal of freedom for scholarly
inquiry but has very inadequately
reflected the pressing issues
confronting society. Examples of
neglected areas have already been
indicated (Section III, paragraph
1). It is the responsibility of this
University to seek and define new
research programs which will
redress the existing imbalance, to
develop alternative support for
new programs through both
public and private sources, and to
use new programs as examples to

persuade the Federal Government
to broaden its support of research
programs derived from local and
regional needs. It is therefore
proposed that:
1) The University Research
Committee shall be enlarged
through the addition of faculty
and students from each major
discipline and shall be charged
specifically with the responsibility
of developing new research
programs. While University
departments themselves shall
retain ultimate authority to
accept or reject new programs and
to hire needed faculty, the
Research Committee shall serve as
a development arm and public
forum for both general and
specific proposals within the
University.
2) The University Research
Committee shall appoint a series
of Citizen Advisory Councils
consisting of individuals from the
community who would contribute
most to the design and
implementation of research
programs at Stanford.
3) The Research Committee
shall be informed of all existing
and new research programs within
the University, shall make this
information publicly available,
and shall have the authority to
make proposals concerning

modification of existing and
development of new plans.
However, the Research
Committee shall not have veto
authority over programs or
proposals of individual faculty
members or departments.
4) Stanford University,
through the Research Committee,
shall work with other universities
and citizens' groups at the local
and national level to accomplish
an alteration of national priorities
so that social needs will achieve
greater attention, to assign
responsibility for scientific and
social research away from the
military into other governmental
agencies, and to extend the
practice of review of research
proposals by peer groups to these
other agencies.
5) The University Research
Committee shall re-examine the
desirability of establishing or
supporting a separate research
institute to conduct applied
research on social problems.
Advantages of such a separate
institution would include easier
participation of non-University
personnel in such research and
development programs and would
reduce the needs for the
University to expand its regular
faculty to accomplish some of the
research goals.
(This is the third and
concluding part of the Faculty
Political Action Group
statement.)
GOVERNANCE OF THE
UNIVERSITY
Governing bodies of the
University should reflect and
represent the composition of the
University. In general, members of
governing bodies should be
selected by the governed
constituency and not be
self-appointed. The diversity of
individuals involved in University
function should be reflected in
governing bodies; this will assist in
assuring maximum access of new
ideas concerning University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing University policy
and thus enlarging the array of
available alternatives. The staff of
the University should be
appropriately represented within
the governing councils of the
University wherever policy
influences the staff. It is proposed
that:
1) The staff shall be organized
into a representative organization
similar to the Senates of student
and faculty and a coordinating
committee between the three
bodies shall be established.
2) The trustees shall be
considered to be a community
supervising and overseeing body.
They shall be re-organized to be
representative of the different
components of the mid-California
community; thus their
composition will include not only
some who are associated with
business and industry but also
educators, trade unionists, local
government officials, agricultural
workers, and minority
representatives with substantially
increased proportions of youth
and women.
3) The new Board of Trustees
shall have representatives
participating in the three Senates
in the University, and conversely

these bodies shall have permanent
representatives to the trustees.
4) An alternative to the above
proposals should be carefully
examined. The alternative is
organization of a form of
municipal government for the
University community. As the
University has grown in
population, activities and
influence upon the community,
policy decisions of a classical
institutional nature become
political decisions of great
importance for the University
community. It has become more
important to create a local
government which derives from
the concent of the governed and
which guarantees the basic rights
of all citizens to members of the
University community. It would
therefore be wise to consider
separating community
government from academic
government...
...Problems encountered in
democratic self-government
systems include lack of
participation by a significant
number of constituents, a
tendency of some individuals to
hold multiple positions, and thus
a tendency toward homogeneity
of ideas. A mechanism is needed
which will provide a continuous
source of representatives who
enter the governmental system
without prior commitment and
obligation of a political nature
and who will steadily enlarge
participation in governance by a
constituency. It is proposed that:
1 ) Representatives to
University governing bodies be
selected by two mechanisms. The
first will be standard election
techniques which will provide a
majority of representatives in any
given body. The second will be a
lottery which will select a few
representatives at random from
the entire constituency.
2) No individual member of
this faculty will hold more than
one major elected post or one
appointment to a major governing
body at any given time.
