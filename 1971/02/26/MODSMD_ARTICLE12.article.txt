# Bar-Hopping To The Beach
## 
### KIT CAMERON 
For the affluent alcoholic the
pleasures of a day at the beach are
scarcely limited to the sandy
shores. The return trip from San
Gregorio can be pleasantly drawn
out to include several
drinking—and eating, if you
ipsist—stops.
The customary route between
Stanford and the coast involves
New La Honda Road, through
Skylonda Corners, La Honda, and
San Gregorio—where one picks up
the loaf of forgotten French bread
at the one store in town. On the
return journey stop in again for an
hour. The general store has a
name which I can't remember,
just as the guy who owns the
place and tends bar has a name
which no one can seem to
remember. It has a shifting
clientele of San Gregorio regulars
and beach transients. When the
latter join the former, who appear
to be affixed to their stools, they
are cheerfully regaled with the
story of the whip's wheel perched
above the rows of glasses. If you
can tell which is the top spoke
you're a better sailor than I am.
The bartender will also readily
tell you how he wished Herbert
Hoover a happy birthday—as the
erstwhile pres was exiting from
the john.

About one half of the actual
counter is an antique refrigerator,
so that you can chill your knees as
you sit. The other half is 'ye olde
original bar' with scratches and
scars overlaid by a patina of age.
The regular patrons usually seem
to congregate at the end nearest
the door, with one or two more
standing behind them next to the
potato chip stand. The silent mass
of the store itself, with overalls
and tin buckets, provides an echo
chamber for the show.
Mellowed by the first stop
home, one may then amble up
into the hills to the Boot and
Saddle Lodge, a consciously rustic
restaurant cum bar, which has the
smoke-cured smell of an open-fire
heated cabin. The bartender is an
enormously fat guy who wheezes
lightfootedly about the place,
keeping glasses filled—at 65 cents
a drink, quite decent. He
encourages the company to
intepret a faintly psychedelic
cryptogram behind the bar. There
are various visual toys to occupy
the idle mind—electric beer signs
and a mechanical beer wagon
which goes roun' and roun' on the
shelf. Late in the evening the
crowd is quite liquorous and
friendly; one whisky-voiced
woman spent a long time trying to
convince a male member of our

group to get his hair cut—'You'd
look so much sexier.'
This lodge, alas, will be closed
until sometime in March, when its
owner returns from his annual trip
to Mazatlan. When it reopens, I
strongly suggest you visit their
dixieland jam every third Sunday
afternoon. The music, which ir>
frantic homegrown jazz, is free,
and the place is packed with
boozy happy folk.
The Boot and Saddle serves a
good dinner ('dry abalone,' says
my seafood expert
friendr-whether that is good or
bad, I can't determine) until 9
p.m. (but is closed Mondays). If
you want something a little
cheaper, however, trundle up the
road to the Venturis Motel, which
has a bar and food—good
hamburgers but only passable
booze, again at 65 cents a drink.
The decor features formica
woodgrain walls and funny signs,
a gold sparkel plastic arm rest on
the bar, and a ship's wheel with
clocks marking time in various
part of the world. The plastic
kitsch is relieved by a poker game
in which the bartender is
participating; at one end of the
room and a bearded man reading
at the other. The regulars in red
lumber jack caps, listen to 'Okie
from Muskogee' on the jukebox,

but there is a poster for HAIR on
the ceiling showing of all things,
nekkid hippies.
Apple Jacks, practically next
door to Venturis, doesn't serve
food, but the bourbon and scotch
are better—also 65 cents each. The
wood of the bar has been
scrubbed so many times it glows
with a waxless shine. The floor is
colored by centuries of ground-in
dirt, and the beamed ceilings are
well seasoned by smoke. The
boards between have laid in such
patterns that the effect is of a
medieval 'closet'. A well-fed
green-eyed tomcat accepts
moderate affection from patrons;
he appears to enjoy sleeping on
the shuffleboard table—which
could be awkward if you wanted
to play, but he is a gentleman
about moving.
There are no dim lights or soft
music in this place. The fixtures
are bright white globes and a Shell
fly strip dangles next to one of
them. But there is a mellowness
about it—a drinking spot with no
pretensions. If you are feeling
exhausted and a little drunk, close
down the evening here. If life
holds more than a good view and
a warm fire, head down the hill to
the Alley or the Goose or any one
of a number of happy places in
the flatlands.

so that you can chill your knees as
you sit. The other half is 'ye olde
original bar' with scratches and
scars overlaid by a patina of age.
The regular patrons usually seem
to congregate at the end nearest
the door, with one or two more
standing behind them next to the
potato chip stand. The silent mass
of the store itself, with overalls
and tin buckets, provides an echo
chamber for the show.
Mellowed by the first stop
home, one may then amble up
into the hills to the Boot and
Saddle Lodge, a consciously rustic
restaurant cum bar, which has the
smoke-cured smell of an open-fire
heated cabin. The bartender is an
enormously fat guy who wheezes
lightfootedly about the place,
keeping glasses filled—at 65 cents
a drink, quite decent. He
encourages the company to
intepret a faintly psychedelic
cryptogram behind the bar. There
are various visual toys to occupy
the idle mind—electric beer signs
and a mechanical beer wagon
which goes roun' and roun' on the
shelf. Late in the evening the
crowd is quite liquorous and
friendly; one whisky-voiced
woman spent a long time trying to
convince a male member of our

group to get his hair cut—'You'd
look so much sexier.'
This lodge, alas, will be closed
until sometime in March, when its
owner returns from his annual trip
to Mazatlan. When it reopens, I
strongly suggest you visit their
dixieland jam every third Sunday
afternoon. The music, which ir>
frantic homegrown jazz, is free,
and the place is packed with
boozy happy folk.
The Boot and Saddle serves a
good dinner ('dry abalone,' says
my seafood expert
friendr-whether that is good or
bad, I can't determine) until 9
p.m. (but is closed Mondays). If
you want something a little
cheaper, however, trundle up the
road to the Venturis Motel, which
has a bar and food—good
hamburgers but only passable
booze, again at 65 cents a drink.
The decor features formica
woodgrain walls and funny signs,
a gold sparkel plastic arm rest on
the bar, and a ship's wheel with
clocks marking time in various
part of the world. The plastic
kitsch is relieved by a poker game
in which the bartender is
participating; at one end of the
room and a bearded man reading
at the other. The regulars in red
lumber jack caps, listen to 'Okie
from Muskogee' on the jukebox,

but there is a poster for HAIR on
the ceiling showing of all things,
nekkid hippies.
Apple Jacks, practically next
door to Venturis, doesn't serve
food, but the bourbon and scotch
are better—also 65 cents each. The
wood of the bar has been
scrubbed so many times it glows
with a waxless shine. The floor is
colored by centuries of ground-in
dirt, and the beamed ceilings are
well seasoned by smoke. The
boards between have laid in such
patterns that the effect is of a
medieval 'closet'. A well-fed
green-eyed tomcat accepts
moderate affection from patrons;
he appears to enjoy sleeping on
the shuffleboard table—which
could be awkward if you wanted
to play, but he is a gentleman
about moving.
There are no dim lights or soft
music in this place. The fixtures
are bright white globes and a Shell
fly strip dangles next to one of
them. But there is a mellowness
about it—a drinking spot with no
pretensions. If you are feeling
exhausted and a little drunk, close
down the evening here. If life
holds more than a good view and
a warm fire, head down the hill to
the Alley or the Goose or any one
of a number of happy places in
the flatlands.
For the affluent alcoholic the
pleasures of a day at the beach are
scarcely limited to the sandy
shores. The return trip from San
Gregorio can be pleasantly drawn
out to include several
drinking—and eating, if you
ipsist—stops.
The customary route between
Stanford and the coast involves
New La Honda Road, through
Skylonda Corners, La Honda, and
San Gregorio—where one picks up
the loaf of forgotten French bread
at the one store in town. On the
return journey stop in again for an
hour. The general store has a
name which I can't remember,
just as the guy who owns the
place and tends bar has a name
which no one can seem to
remember. It has a shifting
clientele of San Gregorio regulars
and beach transients. When the
latter join the former, who appear
to be affixed to their stools, they
are cheerfully regaled with the
story of the whip's wheel perched
above the rows of glasses. If you
can tell which is the top spoke
you're a better sailor than I am.
The bartender will also readily
tell you how he wished Herbert
Hoover a happy birthday—as the
erstwhile pres was exiting from
the john.

look so much sexier.'
This lodge, alas, will be closed
until sometime in March, when its
owner returns from his annual trip
to Mazatlan. When it reopens, I
strongly suggest you visit their
dixieland jam every third Sunday
afternoon. The music, which ir>
frantic homegrown jazz, is free,
and the place is packed with
boozy happy folk.
The Boot and Saddle serves a
good dinner ('dry abalone,' says
my seafood expert
friendr-whether that is good or
bad, I can't determine) until 9
p.m. (but is closed Mondays). If
you want something a little
cheaper, however, trundle up the
road to the Venturis Motel, which
has a bar and food—good
hamburgers but only passable
booze, again at 65 cents a drink.
The decor features formica
woodgrain walls and funny signs,
a gold sparkel plastic arm rest on
the bar, and a ship's wheel with
clocks marking time in various
part of the world. The plastic
kitsch is relieved by a poker game
in which the bartender is
participating; at one end of the
room and a bearded man reading
at the other. The regulars in red
lumber jack caps, listen to 'Okie
from Muskogee' on the jukebox,

but there is a poster for HAIR on
the ceiling showing of all things,
nekkid hippies.
Apple Jacks, practically next
door to Venturis, doesn't serve
food, but the bourbon and scotch
are better—also 65 cents each. The
wood of the bar has been
scrubbed so many times it glows
with a waxless shine. The floor is
colored by centuries of ground-in
dirt, and the beamed ceilings are
well seasoned by smoke. The
boards between have laid in such
patterns that the effect is of a
medieval 'closet'. A well-fed
green-eyed tomcat accepts
moderate affection from patrons;
he appears to enjoy sleeping on
the shuffleboard table—which
could be awkward if you wanted
to play, but he is a gentleman
about moving.
There are no dim lights or soft
music in this place. The fixtures
are bright white globes and a Shell
fly strip dangles next to one of
them. But there is a mellowness
about it—a drinking spot with no
pretensions. If you are feeling
exhausted and a little drunk, close
down the evening here. If life
holds more than a good view and
a warm fire, head down the hill to
the Alley or the Goose or any one
of a number of happy places in
the flatlands.
