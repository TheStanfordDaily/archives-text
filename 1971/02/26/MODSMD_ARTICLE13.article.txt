# ‘Orpheus In Underworld’ Ambitious But Disappointing
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Music Department opened
its much heralded, eagerly awaited
production of Jacques
Offenbach's "Orpheus in the
Underworld" Wednesday night,
and I can't help feeling that it was
perhaps too much heralded, too
eagerly awaited, for my prime
reaction upon viewing this
ambitious undertaking was
disappointment.
The Music Department must be
congratulated and praised for at
least trying to mount a show like
"Orpheus." This is the same
department that as recently as
two years ago responded to a
suggestion that they undertake a
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta with
a remark that the work of the two
masters of British comic opera
was "too frivolous" for a Music
Department as serious as that of
Stanford University (The Harvard
of the West).
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
makes anything by Gilbert and
Sullivan seem like a paradigm of
dignified restraint. This certainly
indicates a change in attitude in
the Department, and a welcome
change for those of us who would

like to see a revival of comic opera
at Stanford.
Unfortunately, if this
production is a good example of
what we can expect from the
Stanford Opera Theater in the
future, I would prefer that the
Department become serious again.
It's not that "Orpheus in the
Underworld" is really bad. It's
just that it is so annoyingly bad in
spots, and should be so much
better.
Special Effects?
To compensate for an
essentially bare stage, Director
Michel Langinieux has called in
a Special Effects group called
"Garden of Delights." This seem
ingly imaginative move almost
single - handedly destroyed the
show, for "Garden of Delights"
must be one of the most mis
leading names any organization
has ever chosen for itself.
It is not difficult to find shows
at Stanford in which the lighting
is flat and uninteresting, but I
have seldom seen one, anywhere,
in which it was so distracting, so
irrelevant and seemingly
unconcerned with the events

onstage. It may seem petty to
condemn a show because it had
bad lights, but in this case I have
no choice. The special effects of
"Garden of Delights" does more
to hurt "Orpheus in the
Underworld" than all of the bad
singing or bad acting in the world
could do. If "Garden or Delights"
were to pack up and go back to
wherever they came from,
"Orpheus" might be a pretty good
show.
As for the lack of costumes, I
am not sure of the cause and
effect relationship involved here,
but from a financial point of view
it is probably fortunate for the
Opera Theater that this particular
show could get by with so much
skin, and so little clothing.
Costume Designer Peggy
Tonkonogy has done some
marvelous things with a little linen
(very little) and a lot of body
paint. As for the highly publicized
nude scene, well, it's sort of
pointless, but if they want to do
it, it's okay with me.
(I found it curious that the
most heavily dressed characters
were the can-can dancers, the
epitome of nineteenth-century
naughtiness. You've come a long
way, baby.)
The overall effect produced by
this combination of terrible
lighting, somewhat makeshift
(albeit, interesting) costuming,
and a certain lack of stagecraft, is
one of shabbiness. The production
is hangloose and sloppy, with a
patched together look that makes
it hard to enjoy the good things
that are happening in the music
and (Remember? This is a review
of an opera.)
Music Good
And good things do happen
musically. As much as I dislike
concert performances of opera, I
think this one might have been
improved by dispensing with the
theatrical aspects and
concentrating on the music.
Sandor Salgo, as Musical Director,
has done a magnificent job. The
Stanford Symphony Orchestra has
never sounded better, the singing
is generally first rate, and the
choreography of Rhonda Martin
(if I may be allowed to include
choreography under music) is
inspired.
Rosemary Morrison is
delightful as Euridice, the
estranged wife of the violinist
Q-pheus (Offenbach's lyricists had
a rather unique view of Greek
mythology). Miss Morrison is
pretty and shapely, has the
requisite amount of stage 1
presence, and sings in a lovely,
soft soprano.
James Mason as Pluto and Marc
Clemens as Jupiter are the real
stars of the show. Each has a
charisma, a personality, that
reaches from the stage to the
audience. Miss Morrison and Mr.
Clemens have a beautiful duet in
the second act in which Jupiter
wins the love of Euridice by
transforming himself into a fly
and buzzing lovingly into her ear.
It's one of the few scenes that
worked in spite of "Garden of
Delights."
Gerald Chappell as John Styx
has a small but captivating part in
the second act; Anthony Anolini
plays the title role, Nadiene Horst
plays Public Opinion, and Ruby
Andrews, Kari Windingstad, Fred
Cummins, Suzanne Conant,
Suzanne Bales, Melinda Atkins,
and Tom Cushing play assorted
gods and goddesses, in various
states of dress.
Dr. Lincoln E. Moses,
Professor of Statistics and
Preventive Medicine, Dean of
Graduate Studies, plays Bacchus.
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
will be shown tonight and
tomorrow night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and 8 :00 p.m.

reaches from the stage to the
audience. Miss Morrison and Mr.
Clemens have a beautiful duet in
the second act in which Jupiter
wins the love of Euridice by
transforming himself into a fly
and buzzing lovingly into her ear.
It's one of the few scenes that
worked in spite of "Garden of
Delights."
Gerald Chappell as John Styx
has a small but captivating part in
the second act; Anthony Anolini
plays the title role, Nadiene Horst
plays Public Opinion, and Ruby
Andrews, Kari Windingstad, Fred
Cummins, Suzanne Conant,
Suzanne Bales, Melinda Atkins,
and Tom Cushing play assorted
gods and goddesses, in various
states of dress.
Dr. Lincoln E. Moses,
Professor of Statistics and
Preventive Medicine, Dean of
Graduate Studies, plays Bacchus.
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
will be shown tonight and
tomorrow night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and 8 :00 p.m.
The Music Department opened
its much heralded, eagerly awaited
production of Jacques
Offenbach's "Orpheus in the
Underworld" Wednesday night,
and I can't help feeling that it was
perhaps too much heralded, too
eagerly awaited, for my prime
reaction upon viewing this
ambitious undertaking was
disappointment.
The Music Department must be
congratulated and praised for at
least trying to mount a show like
"Orpheus." This is the same
department that as recently as
two years ago responded to a
suggestion that they undertake a
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta with
a remark that the work of the two
masters of British comic opera
was "too frivolous" for a Music
Department as serious as that of
Stanford University (The Harvard
of the West).
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
makes anything by Gilbert and
Sullivan seem like a paradigm of
dignified restraint. This certainly
indicates a change in attitude in
the Department, and a welcome
change for those of us who would

like to see a revival of comic opera
at Stanford.
Unfortunately, if this
production is a good example of
what we can expect from the
Stanford Opera Theater in the
future, I would prefer that the
Department become serious again.
It's not that "Orpheus in the
Underworld" is really bad. It's
just that it is so annoyingly bad in
spots, and should be so much
better.
Special Effects?
To compensate for an
essentially bare stage, Director
Michel Langinieux has called in
a Special Effects group called
"Garden of Delights." This seem
ingly imaginative move almost
single - handedly destroyed the
show, for "Garden of Delights"
must be one of the most mis
leading names any organization
has ever chosen for itself.
It is not difficult to find shows
at Stanford in which the lighting
is flat and uninteresting, but I
have seldom seen one, anywhere,
in which it was so distracting, so
irrelevant and seemingly
unconcerned with the events

onstage. It may seem petty to
condemn a show because it had
bad lights, but in this case I have
no choice. The special effects of
"Garden of Delights" does more
to hurt "Orpheus in the
Underworld" than all of the bad
singing or bad acting in the world
could do. If "Garden or Delights"
were to pack up and go back to
wherever they came from,
"Orpheus" might be a pretty good
show.
As for the lack of costumes, I
am not sure of the cause and
effect relationship involved here,
but from a financial point of view
it is probably fortunate for the
Opera Theater that this particular
show could get by with so much
skin, and so little clothing.
Costume Designer Peggy
Tonkonogy has done some
marvelous things with a little linen
(very little) and a lot of body
paint. As for the highly publicized
nude scene, well, it's sort of
pointless, but if they want to do
it, it's okay with me.
(I found it curious that the
most heavily dressed characters
were the can-can dancers, the
epitome of nineteenth-century
naughtiness. You've come a long
way, baby.)
The overall effect produced by
this combination of terrible
lighting, somewhat makeshift
(albeit, interesting) costuming,
and a certain lack of stagecraft, is
one of shabbiness. The production
is hangloose and sloppy, with a
patched together look that makes
it hard to enjoy the good things
that are happening in the music
and (Remember? This is a review
of an opera.)
Music Good
And good things do happen
musically. As much as I dislike
concert performances of opera, I
think this one might have been
improved by dispensing with the
theatrical aspects and
concentrating on the music.
Sandor Salgo, as Musical Director,
has done a magnificent job. The
Stanford Symphony Orchestra has
never sounded better, the singing
is generally first rate, and the
choreography of Rhonda Martin
(if I may be allowed to include
choreography under music) is
inspired.
Rosemary Morrison is
delightful as Euridice, the
estranged wife of the violinist
Q-pheus (Offenbach's lyricists had
a rather unique view of Greek
mythology). Miss Morrison is
pretty and shapely, has the
requisite amount of stage 1
presence, and sings in a lovely,
soft soprano.
James Mason as Pluto and Marc
Clemens as Jupiter are the real
stars of the show. Each has a
charisma, a personality, that
reaches from the stage to the
audience. Miss Morrison and Mr.
Clemens have a beautiful duet in
the second act in which Jupiter
wins the love of Euridice by
transforming himself into a fly

And good things do happen
musically. As much as I dislike
concert performances of opera, I
think this one might have been
improved by dispensing with the
theatrical aspects and
concentrating on the music.
Sandor Salgo, as Musical Director,
has done a magnificent job. The
Stanford Symphony Orchestra has
never sounded better, the singing
is generally first rate, and the
choreography of Rhonda Martin
(if I may be allowed to include
choreography under music) is
inspired.
Rosemary Morrison is
delightful as Euridice, the
estranged wife of the violinist
Q-pheus (Offenbach's lyricists had
a rather unique view of Greek
mythology). Miss Morrison is
pretty and shapely, has the
requisite amount of stage 1
presence, and sings in a lovely,
soft soprano.
James Mason as Pluto and Marc
Clemens as Jupiter are the real
stars of the show. Each has a
charisma, a personality, that
reaches from the stage to the
audience. Miss Morrison and Mr.
Clemens have a beautiful duet in
the second act in which Jupiter
wins the love of Euridice by
transforming himself into a fly
and buzzing lovingly into her ear.
It's one of the few scenes that
worked in spite of "Garden of
Delights."
Gerald Chappell as John Styx
has a small but captivating part in
the second act; Anthony Anolini
plays the title role, Nadiene Horst
plays Public Opinion, and Ruby
Andrews, Kari Windingstad, Fred
Cummins, Suzanne Conant,
Suzanne Bales, Melinda Atkins,
and Tom Cushing play assorted
gods and goddesses, in various
states of dress.
Dr. Lincoln E. Moses,
Professor of Statistics and
Preventive Medicine, Dean of
Graduate Studies, plays Bacchus.
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
will be shown tonight and
tomorrow night in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, and 8 :00 p.m.
The Music Department opened
its much heralded, eagerly awaited
production of Jacques
Offenbach's "Orpheus in the
Underworld" Wednesday night,
and I can't help feeling that it was
perhaps too much heralded, too
eagerly awaited, for my prime
reaction upon viewing this
ambitious undertaking was
disappointment.
The Music Department must be
congratulated and praised for at
least trying to mount a show like
"Orpheus." This is the same
department that as recently as
two years ago responded to a
suggestion that they undertake a
Gilbert and Sullivan operetta with
a remark that the work of the two
masters of British comic opera
was "too frivolous" for a Music
Department as serious as that of
Stanford University (The Harvard
of the West).
"Orpheus in the Underworld"
makes anything by Gilbert and
Sullivan seem like a paradigm of
dignified restraint. This certainly
indicates a change in attitude in
the Department, and a welcome
change for those of us who would

like to see a revival of comic opera
at Stanford.
Unfortunately, if this
production is a good example of
what we can expect from the
Stanford Opera Theater in the
future, I would prefer that the
Department become serious again.
It's not that "Orpheus in the
Underworld" is really bad. It's
just that it is so annoyingly bad in
spots, and should be so much
better.
Special Effects?
To compensate for an
essentially bare stage, Director
Michel Langinieux has called in
a Special Effects group called
"Garden of Delights." This seem
ingly imaginative move almost
single - handedly destroyed the
show, for "Garden of Delights"
must be one of the most mis
leading names any organization
has ever chosen for itself.
It is not difficult to find shows
at Stanford in which the lighting
is flat and uninteresting, but I
have seldom seen one, anywhere,
in which it was so distracting, so
irrelevant and seemingly
unconcerned with the events

onstage. It may seem petty to
condemn a show because it had
bad lights, but in this case I have
no choice. The special effects of
"Garden of Delights" does more
to hurt "Orpheus in the
Underworld" than all of the bad
singing or bad acting in the world
could do. If "Garden or Delights"
were to pack up and go back to
wherever they came from,
"Orpheus" might be a pretty good
show.
As for the lack of costumes, I
am not sure of the cause and
effect relationship involved here,
but from a financial point of view
it is probably fortunate for the
Opera Theater that this particular
show could get by with so much
skin, and so little clothing.
Costume Designer Peggy
Tonkonogy has done some
marvelous things with a little linen
(very little) and a lot of body
paint. As for the highly publicized
nude scene, well, it's sort of
pointless, but if they want to do
it, it's okay with me.
(I found it curious that the
most heavily dressed characters
were the can-can dancers, the
epitome of nineteenth-century
naughtiness. You've come a long
way, baby.)
The overall effect produced by
this combination of terrible
lighting, somewhat makeshift
(albeit, interesting) costuming,
and a certain lack of stagecraft, is
one of shabbiness. The production
is hangloose and sloppy, with a
patched together look that makes
it hard to enjoy the good things
that are happening in the music
and (Remember? This is a review
of an opera.)
