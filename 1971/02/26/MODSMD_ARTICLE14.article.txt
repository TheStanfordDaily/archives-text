# Ruggers Host Cal
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
"Remember the Big Game!"
will be the rallying cry this
weekend as Stanford's rugby
teams take on the Cal Bears in the
opening round of play for the Big
Scrum Axe. The varsity kicks off
at 1:30 on Harry Maloney Soccer
Field while the seconds meet Cal's
"Guanos" at 3:00 p.m.
The Big Scrum Axe is awarded
annually to the team which rolls
up the most points in the two
game, home and home series.
Stanford will be defending the
Axe it won when it swept both
games last year. This year's duel
should be a far closer battle.
Coach Pete Kmetovic's ruggers
picked up a little momentum to
carry into the contest when they
knocked off previously unbeaten
UCLA last week. Stanford's
forwards paced by the play of Wade
Killefer, Bill Buckland, and Ron
Kadziel and aided by the jumping
of Chris Fletcher in the lineouts,
controlled the ball and gave the
corps of backs room to operate.
The backs moved the ball well

among themselves and appeared
to have conquered the timing
problem that has plagued them all
year. Unfortunately, winger
Reggie Sanderson suffered a
seperation of his shoulder and will
be lost for Cal and the remainder
of the season. Eric Cross will
return to action this week, fully
recovered from a head injury
sustained in practice last week.
The Bears have compiled a 4-4
season's record, but Coach "Doc"
Hudson praises his forwards as
"the best pack we've had in a long
time." The Cal team is thinned by
injuries and have had to make
several line-up changes to fill in
the gaps. Reports indicate,
though, that football quarterback
Dave Penhall played well in his
first game at scrum half for the
Bears' firsts last week.
The Indians, looking to repeat
as the nation's number one
collegiate team, have had a good
week of practice and are counting
on settling a score run up in
November at Berkeley's Memorial
Stadium.


WATCH OUTâ€”Sixth-seeded Rick Fisher, shown here in pre-season
play will compete with other Tribe survivors this weekend in the
conclusion of the Northern California Intercollegiates here at
Stanford. Fisher and teammate Gerry Groslimond are seeded fourth in
the doubles.
