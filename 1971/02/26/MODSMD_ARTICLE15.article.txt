### 
Stanford's varsity grapplers
challenge UC Berkeley Saturday
in the Old Pavilion at 7:30 p.m.
The Indians boast a meager 2-6
season log but several individuals
make the team a threat in
tournament wrestling.
Last weekend, both senior
Dave Thomas and freshman Chris
Horpel reached the finals in the
Arizona State Invitational.
Horpel, competing at 150
pounds, lost very closely to ASU's

Gary Coley, who holds the record
for most pins in a dual meet
season with 18 this season. Coach
Dave Reed called the 6-4 match
loss the "best of the season" for
the highly-regarded Horpel.
Thomas was outscored by
Kelly Trujillo of ASU, 1 8-6, in the
1 4 2 -pound class.
In other action last week,
Thomas outpointed UCLA's
standout Eddie King 5-0 in
Stanford's 35-12 defeat. Coach

Reed called Thomas' performance
"the best match of his collegiate
wrestling career."
Against Cal Poly (5.L.0.), a
squad Reed tagged as "the finest
wrestling team on the West Coast
this season," the Indians salvaged
only one win and a tie.
Thomas picked up a 2-1
victory in the 142 class while
Horpel struggled to tie at 150. In
that match, Horpel came back in
the final four seconds to even it
up at 7-7.
