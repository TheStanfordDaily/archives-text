# Icers Beat Belmont
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After losing four times to the
Belmont Seniors, the Stanford
hockey team finally beat them,
8 -3. Because they won by five
goals, the Indians go to the finals
of the Northern California Senior
Hockey League where they will
face the Berkeley Juniors. The
first game is Monday night at
Legg's arena in San Francisco.
For the first time this season
Stanford played up to their
potential. The result was fine
positional play at both ends,
excellent goaltending, tenacious
forechecking, and fine passing.
The team covered their opponents
in front of goalie Rick Bragden.
On offense, the Indians were
led by assistant captain Paul
Tittmann's hat trick. Ralph
Brown, Pat Baldwin, Chris
Counihan, Ed Leonard and Rich
Jaros added single goals for
Stanford.
Stanford fell behind in the first
period, but Paul Tittmann scored
twice to put Stanford ahead, 2-1.
Belmont came back to tie the
score, but Rich Jaros and Ed
Leonard tallied to put Stanford
ahead to stay.
Although Belmont scored again
to move within a goal, they
weren't really thinking about

winning the game. They figured
that Stanford would probably
win, but not by the five goals
needed to put the Indians into the
playoffs.
The Cards dominated the third
period, scoring four more goals,
two on power plays. Counihan
tallied only 54 seconds into the
period. Ralph Brown made the
score 6-3 on a screened shot from
the point. Player-coach, Pat
Baldwin, scored an unassisted
goal, the second power play goal
of the period and the third of the
game. The goal made the score 7-3
with 15 minutes left in the game.
Tittmann Scores Winner
Paul Tittman scored the
winning goal with a little more
than five minutes remaining. He
stopped a Belmont clearing pass
and found himself all alone in
front of the net. His shot found
the far corner and Stanford led by
five goals 8 -3.
Belmont began taking all kinds
of chances trying to close the gap.
This provided the Cards with
several excellent opportunities to
score on breakaways. Fortunately
time ran out for Belmont and
Stanford was on top 8 -3; the five
goal margin gave Stanford one
more goal overall in the two game
series.

Legg's arena in San Francisco.
For the first time this season
Stanford played up to their
potential. The result was fine
positional play at both ends,
excellent goaltending, tenacious
forechecking, and fine passing.
The team covered their opponents
in front of goalie Rick Bragden.
On offense, the Indians were
led by assistant captain Paul
Tittmann's hat trick. Ralph
Brown, Pat Baldwin, Chris
Counihan, Ed Leonard and Rich
Jaros added single goals for
Stanford.
Stanford fell behind in the first
period, but Paul Tittmann scored
twice to put Stanford ahead, 2-1.
Belmont came back to tie the
score, but Rich Jaros and Ed
Leonard tallied to put Stanford
ahead to stay.
Although Belmont scored again
to move within a goal, they
weren't really thinking about

winning the game. They figured
that Stanford would probably
win, but not by the five goals
needed to put the Indians into the
playoffs.
The Cards dominated the third
period, scoring four more goals,
two on power plays. Counihan
tallied only 54 seconds into the
period. Ralph Brown made the
score 6-3 on a screened shot from
the point. Player-coach, Pat
Baldwin, scored an unassisted
goal, the second power play goal
of the period and the third of the
game. The goal made the score 7-3
with 15 minutes left in the game.
Tittmann Scores Winner
Paul Tittman scored the
winning goal with a little more
than five minutes remaining. He
stopped a Belmont clearing pass
and found himself all alone in
front of the net. His shot found
the far corner and Stanford led by
five goals 8 -3.
Belmont began taking all kinds
of chances trying to close the gap.
This provided the Cards with
several excellent opportunities to
score on breakaways. Fortunately
time ran out for Belmont and
Stanford was on top 8 -3; the five
goal margin gave Stanford one
more goal overall in the two game
series.
