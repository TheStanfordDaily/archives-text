# Reds Face Oregon
## 
### TOM QUINN 
Stanford basketball fans will
see their last games of the season
this weekend in Maples Pavillion.
Howie Dalmar's varsity squad
continues their quest for a second
league victory against Oregon
State Friday and Oregon Saturday
at 8 :00 p.m.
The chances for victory aren't
improved at all over last
weekend's trip to Washington, but
unless the Indians can tackle
either Oregon or Oregon State,
last place looks inevitable. Oregon
State seems a likely prospect since
it has a weak 2-6 league record,
after two devastating losses to
UCLA and USC last weekend, but
the Beavers have beaten Stanford
twice already this season, 82-75
and 88-70.
Oregon was narrowly beaten
by the L.A. powers once again last
weekend, and might be expected
to let down. However, the Ducks'
3-5 league record hides the fact
that Oregon was consistently in
the top 20 early in the season and
has the PAC-8 leading scorer, Stan
Love. Love had a 4 7-point
weekend in Los Angeles, and
currently sports a 26.1 scoring
average in league games.
A hopeful note in the
prospects for victory is the
Indians' continued improvement
last weekend in Washington.

Though Stanford fell 89-7 9 to
Washington State and 7 2-69 to
Washington, the wide margins of
defeat, evident earlier in the
season, are a thing of the past. In
fact, the Indians were in both
games, especially the Washington
contest in which the lead was
seldom more than a point for
either team.
Typical Terry
Claude Terry gave a typical
performance, scoring 43 points
and securing the third spot in the
league scoring race with 21.8
average. Terry is in good position
to gain all-time Stanford career
scorer by the end of next year
since his 920 points has raised him
to twelfth on the list.
Mike Michell and Bob Buell
lent strong support in both
rebounding and scoring categories.
The added rebounding strength of
Larry Rosenzweig, coupled with
his increased adaptability to the
team's style, may at least slow
down big men such as Love. The
team will need all the support it
can get for the following weekend
in L.A. during which seniors such
as Rosenzweig, Chuck Moore, and
Dennis O'Neill will have their last
chance to play UCLA and USC.
Best Frosh
Stanford's freshmen will be
gunning for their best record ever

this weekend against St. Mary's
and the Stanford Alumni at
Maples. A double win would give
the Indians a 16-2 record with
both losses being narrow one
point defeats on the road.
Last weekend, Stanford beat
UOP 73-71 in Stockton on
Friday, but were tipped by Santa
Clara, 73-72 the following night in
San Jose. The Indians had stopped
the Broncos earlier this season in
Maples, but Steve Shupe's
30-point effort was not enough
last Saturday.
