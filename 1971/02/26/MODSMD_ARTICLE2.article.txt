# Mixed Feeling On Carnegie Paper
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
The suggestions for the latest
Carnegie Commission on Higher
Education are being studies here, but
no specific proposals for action yet
have been advanced.
The 19 -member commission, chaired
by Clark Kerr, former President of the
University of California proposed last
fall that some degrees be awarded in
shorter time, such as three year
undergraduate degree. Further
proposals were for cutting down on the
areas of specialization, limiting the
Ph.D. to just a few advanced
researchers (replacing it in most cases
with a new four-year. Doctor of Arts
degree), and making two years of
college education available to everyone
in the country through an "Educational
Security" program, comparable to
Social Security. The commission feels
that doing these things would reduce
the financial costs of education to
society.
The commission also said that
"society would gain if more students
were also workers and more workers
were also students." They state that
segregating youths in classrooms for
extended periods creates boredom and
rebellion. In fact, some 60 percent of
college students quit before getting
degrees. The commission wants to see
more opportunities for students to
drop out to go to work and then come
back to their studies later.
"I am talking a great deal with the
Deans of the different schools as to
what the report means to their
schools," said University Provost
William Miller, and he adds, "I don't
sense a lot of favorable response."

Miller stated that at Stanford there
is "no serious consideration" of using
the commission's proposals to reduce
the chance of student unrest. "I'm sure
somewhere someone would be
worrying about that, but not here."
He did say that "students sometimes
feel trapped in a curriculum with no
end in sight," but added that "a lot of
student unrest does not stem from
dissatisfaction with the curriculum, but
from dissatisfaction with the
Establishment."
lan Watt, Chairman of the English
Department, said "the report is an
effort to find the way out of the bind
essentially coming from the fact of
recession and taxpayer reaction at the
Board of Education level, against
increasing costs. The fact has always
been that people, both as taxpayers and
as parents, have never been able to give
education the support that it needs to
be really good."
Watt sees conflict between the idea
of accelerated degrees and the idea of
liberal education. "English," he says,
"but probably most other subjects as
well, requires time for digestion and
reflection. This (the report) is part of
the reaction that has been stronger
since Sputnik. Part of that is
encouraging very young kids to what I
call precocious maturity. Make kids at
every stage speed up."
Stating that some people see
education merely as a matter of filling
vessels with knowledge, he went on to
say that he is "suspicious both of not
wanting to pay the price and of
regarding human beings as mechanisms
that can be manipulated."
He sees value in reducing the

number of specialized degrees but, "I
shudder at all the committees that
would have to be set up." He would
like to see the present degree system
made more flexible.
"There is obviously something
wrong," Watt said "but the idea that
any large scale social engineering will
solve it is wrong. There are profound
social and psychological forces that no
slystem can really get at." He believes
that even if all the recommendations of
the Carnegie Commission were
institued there would still be some
dissatisfied students.
Psychology professor Lee Ross does
not see less activism on campus if the
report is followed.

"One of the feelings," he says, "is to
get people out in the worldâ€”make
them more cynical, more inclined to
worry about themselves, take advantage
of the generation gap." He points to
"the very conservative" generation of
students right after World War 11, but
he says that failure in operating out in
the system can lead to radicalism. "A
large percentage of black radicals are
people who rejected the civil rights
movement."
Dr. Ross does not see any dramatic
effect in making two years of college
available to everyone in the country.
He points out that California already
makes junior college available to many
of its citizens, and does not see any
great implications if the two years of
college are like an extension of high
school. "People who talk about these
things tend to think about going to
Stanford."
The Carnegie Commission's report is
still being studied and all of its
implications are not yet known.
Provost Miller said that "the institution
and I have not developed any
formalized response." He does give
indications that more on the subject
will be forthcoming later this year.
