# Keilch Demands Lyman's Presence
## President Summoned 
### PHIL LIND 
At yesterday's hearing in the case of
suspended library worker John Keilch
read a letter requesting that President
rtichard Lyman appear as a witness
before the grievance committee hearing
his cast*.
Keilch was informed by George T.
Gregory, chairman of the committee,
that, "you (Keilch) must submit a
written statement demonstrating why it
would be relevant for President Lyman
to testify at an open hearing of the
review committee."
In the letter Keilch submitted to
the committee, reasons were presented

in defense of the request. "If you are
unaware of your role in the events, how
can you explain your statements
immediately following the interruption
of war criminal Lodge? What did you
mean when you spoke on KZSU the
day after the incident and said, "We are
trying to collect evidence as to who did
it, and prosecution will follow from
that.
"Don't you remember that just last
Thursday in the Faculty Senate meeting
you presented a specific report on the
status of my case.
"The testimony which has been
presented by your subordinate
administrative officers (Weber,
Borgeson, Nelson, and Schwartz) has
been characterized every day of the
hearings by the phenomenon of
"passing the buck." You are the only
remaining person in a position of
authority who can testify about the
policies involved in this case and about
the chain of events which led up to it."
Keilch did not indicate to the
committee when he expected a reply
from his request. It was also noted that
Lyman is named as one of the people
against whom Keilch has a grievance.
In testimony yesterday several
witnesses expressed their views of the
Lodge incident as well as the events
following.
No decision was reached at
yesterday's hearing and the committee
will reconvene today at 4:15 in Bishop
Auditorium.
