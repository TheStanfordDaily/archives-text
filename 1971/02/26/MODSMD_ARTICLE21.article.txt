# Stanford Summary

In a letter to the United Stanford
Employees (USE) Robert M. Nelson,
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, stated yesterday that those
individuals laid off at Tresidder "will be
considered for reassignment elsewhere
in the University.
"... Efforts have started on
referring these employees too available
job openings.," the letter continued.
"Curtailment of operations at Tresidder
will require that placement attempts be
made in other locations at the
University."
Nelson's letter responded to the five
demands issued at a rally held last
Tuesday. He indicated that relocation
and retraining of workers will be
attempted "to the extent that funds are
available," so that loss of jobs by
employees is avoided.
Nelson also stated that he could not
guarantee that there would be no more
lay-offs or suspensions.
Responding to Lyman's letters, a
USE spokesman told the Daily last
night, "... Nelson misunderstood our
demands. We did not want him to
respond, but to consult with those who
have the authority to make the decision
we requested."

About 75 persons were evacuated
from the Main Library last night after
the Daily received a threatening
telephone call. Police and firemen
searched the building, but found
nothing.

Earlier in the day, Tresidder Union
was cleared for about 30 minutes after
a male caller told TMU food services
director Raymond C. Harrington that a
bomb under a table in the dining room
was set to go off in 15 minutes.
There was no bomb, and when
police allowed the noontime crowd to
reenter the building, business seemed
slower than usual. TMU has been the
object of a continuing staff-student
boycott because of staff reductions
there.
There was no mention of a bomb in
either of the two telephone calls made
to the Daily. The first caller told staffer
Lang Atwood:
"Dear Daily, take this down.
Tonight we took another step. If John
Keilch isn't reinstated, then further
actions will follow ... Free all political
prisoners and end repression. All power
to the people." â€¢
A librarian reported that at about
the same time students had staged a
mini book-in, stacking books up on
desks and possibly switching them
around on the shelves.

Memorial services for Professor
David M. Potter, Stanford historian,
author, and expert on the history of
the South's sucession, will be held in
the University's Memorial Church at 2
p.m. Sunday, Feb. 28.
Professor Potter died early
Thursday, Feb. 18, of cancer at the
Stanford Medical Center.
