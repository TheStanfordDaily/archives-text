# Monday Hearing Set
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The "show cause" hearing, in which
University attorneys will attempt to
procure a preliminary injunction
against 17 defendants, will resume at
9:00 a.m. Monday, at the Santa Clara
County courthouse.
The students who will be prosecuted
must show cause why they should not
be enjoined from participating in
actions specified in a temporary
restraining order (TRO) which the
University obtained February 12. The
non-student defendants must show
cause why they should not be barred
from entry to and presence on the
University campus.
Last Thursday, at the hearing's first
session, the seven defendants who had
been served with the TRO, were
granted a continuance of their case by
Superior Court Judge Stanley R. Evans.
Evans also dissolved the TRO for the
10 defendants who hadn't been served
with the document at least two days
prior to the hearingâ€”the legal time
limit for the order to be considered
binding.
University attorneys immediately
obtained another TRO, and according
to defendant, Theresa Ramirez, all but
two defendants have been served.
Ramirez also revealed that the new
TRO, which was issued in response to
the campus unrest that occurred
between January 11 (the date of the
Lodge disruption) and February 12,
was obtained partly on the basis of

depositions taken last spring from
Roger Reed and Harvey Hukari, both
19 70 graduates and former members of
the Free Campus Movement.
David Heilbron, the prosecuting
attorney conceded that "the affidavits
for the new TRO were served in court
on Mr. Tooby (Norton Tooby will
represent all the defendants except
Bruce Franklin and possibly Janet
Weiss). One contains passages from
depositions taken from conservative
students.
"I don't know quite frankly whether
they'll (the depositions) be relevant.
I'm not going to talk about the
relevance of the pending litigation."
Tooby could not be reached for
comment.
