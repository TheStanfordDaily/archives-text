# SJC Recommendations Approved
## 
### 
President Richard W. Lyman
approved yesterday six of the Stanford
Judicial Council's recommendations
penalizing students for disruption of
the Henry Cabot Lodge speech here last
Jan. 11.
The suspensions, ranging from one
to four quarters, will take effect
Friday, March 5, unless individual
defendants request that the penalty be
postponed until the start of Spring
quarter, March 29.
The case of seventh defendant, Janet
Weiss, was recommended to the
Council for further consideration. The
SJC had recommended a penalty of
four quarters suspension for Weiss.
In a letter to Lyman, Weiss charged
that there were irregularities in the
procedure by which the Council arrived

at its recommended penalties, and
asked that her case be remanded to the
SJC.
In a letter to SJC chairman Howard
Williams, Lyman yesterday noted that
Weiss "charges that she believed the
maximum penalty she could receive
was one quarter suspension because she
did not consider her convictions in civil
court for violation of an injunction
obtained by Stanford to curb
disruptions on campus would be
considered in these (the SJC)
proceedings.
"I am not persuaded that Mrs. Weiss
could reasonably have assumed that
those offenses against the University
would not be relevant in her
case. .. She also charges that the
Council assumed that those convictions

were before the SJC, and infers that
this influenced its decision. The
opinions (issued by the SJC) do not
clarify this issue," the letter continued.
Lyman requested that the SJC,
specifically address itself to the
relevance of the fact that her
convictions for participating in two
disruptions on campus last spring were
in court rather than before the SJC.
Sentences pending for the six
defendants are: Jeffrey Youdelman,
four-quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed; Geraldine Foote and
Theresa Ramirez, four-quarter
suspension with three quarters stayed;
Michael Holman, two-quarter
suspension with one quarter stayed;
Bradley Dowden and Merle Rabine,
one-quarter suspension.
