# Nixon Charges Hanoi With War Expansion
## 
### 
WASHINGTON — President Nixon
today charged Hanoi with broadening
the Vietnam war into an Indochina
conflict and predicted the United
States and its allies will have more hard
choices in combatting possible new
enemy thrusts in South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
In a globe-ranging report officially
directed to Congress but aimed at the
nation and the rest of the world, Nixon
keyed his message to a quest for "a
full generation of peace" this century.
But, he said, "If winding down the war
is my greatest satisfaction in foreign
policy, the failure to end it is my
deepest disappointment."
He pledged to continue the winding
down, the U.S. troop withdrawal from
South Vietnam. But in stark contrast to
his declared global peace goal his
projection for Indochina emphasized
the broadened war and increased
American aid and air support for allied
ground forces.
In discussion the Indochina crisis at
considerable detail Nixon gave a deeply
pessimistic report about the prospects
for a negotiated settlement.

He had "frankly expected" some
kind of action from the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong side last year,
Nixon stated, when he expanded
political principles for a settlement and
appointed ambassador David Bruce as
peace negotiator.
In this, he indicated, he was
completely disappointed. But "We will
not give up on negotiations," he said,
"though the past year indicated that it
will be extremely difficult to overcome
the enemy's mix of doctrine
calculations and suspicion.
"There is the additional fact that as
our forces decline the role we can play
on many aspects of a settlement is also
bound to decline."
However, in his radio address
summarizing elements of the bulky
congressional message, Nixon directed
another call to Hanoi for serious peace
negotiations and renewed proposals he
first advanced last Oct. 7, including in
immediate standstill cease-fire and an
Indochina peace conference.
The chief executive indicated that
regardless of what happens in Paris he is
certain of the final outcome in
Vietnam. "In Southeast Asia today,"
he said over the radio, "aggression is
failing.. . South Vietnam now has an
excellent opportunity not only to
survive but to build a strong, free
society."
And while affirming his intention to
announce soon a new schedule of
American troops withdrawals, the
President said some U.S. forces will
remain in South Vietnam "as long as
North Vietnam continues to hold a
single American prisoner."
"Enemy intentions and capabilities
in Indochina will pose some hard
choices about the deployment of allied
troops as we pursue our withdrawals,"
he continued, and North Vietnamese
actions (in Laos and Cambodia) could
require high levels of American
assistance and air operations in order to
further Vietnamization and our
withdrawals.

WASHINGTON — President Nixon
today charged Hanoi with broadening
the Vietnam war into an Indochina
conflict and predicted the United
States and its allies will have more hard
choices in combatting possible new
enemy thrusts in South Vietnam,
Cambodia and Laos.
In a globe-ranging report officially
directed to Congress but aimed at the
nation and the rest of the world, Nixon
keyed his message to a quest for "a
full generation of peace" this century.
But, he said, "If winding down the war
is my greatest satisfaction in foreign
policy, the failure to end it is my
deepest disappointment."
He pledged to continue the winding
down, the U.S. troop withdrawal from
South Vietnam. But in stark contrast to
his declared global peace goal his
projection for Indochina emphasized
the broadened war and increased
American aid and air support for allied
ground forces.
In discussion the Indochina crisis at
considerable detail Nixon gave a deeply
pessimistic report about the prospects
for a negotiated settlement.

He had "frankly expected" some
kind of action from the North
Vietnamese-Viet Cong side last year,
Nixon stated, when he expanded
political principles for a settlement and
appointed ambassador David Bruce as
peace negotiator.
In this, he indicated, he was
completely disappointed. But "We will
not give up on negotiations," he said,
"though the past year indicated that it
will be extremely difficult to overcome
the enemy's mix of doctrine
calculations and suspicion.
"There is the additional fact that as
our forces decline the role we can play
on many aspects of a settlement is also
bound to decline."
However, in his radio address
summarizing elements of the bulky
congressional message, Nixon directed
another call to Hanoi for serious peace
negotiations and renewed proposals he
first advanced last Oct. 7, including in
immediate standstill cease-fire and an
Indochina peace conference.
The chief executive indicated that
regardless of what happens in Paris he is
certain of the final outcome in
Vietnam. "In Southeast Asia today,"
he said over the radio, "aggression is
failing.. . South Vietnam now has an
excellent opportunity not only to
survive but to build a strong, free
society."
And while affirming his intention to
announce soon a new schedule of
American troops withdrawals, the
President said some U.S. forces will
remain in South Vietnam "as long as
North Vietnam continues to hold a
single American prisoner."
"Enemy intentions and capabilities
in Indochina will pose some hard
choices about the deployment of allied
troops as we pursue our withdrawals,"
he continued, and North Vietnamese
actions (in Laos and Cambodia) could
require high levels of American
assistance and air operations in order to
further Vietnamization and our
withdrawals.
