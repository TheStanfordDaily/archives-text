# Quark: Physicist Studies Nature Of Universe
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
"One of the most discouraging things in physics is an experiment that is already
over." With a little irony, William Fairbank, Professor of Physics and a leading
researcher in the department, prefaced a talk given last Tuesday night billed as a
glimpse at the beginning and end of the universe.
The topic of his talk was merely an introduction to those experiments of his
which are not "already over." The most exciting is the search for a quark, a less
and less hypothetical particle with only a fraction of the charge on an electron.
For the last four years a graduate student of Fairbank, Arthur Hebard, has been
looking for a particle which in theory has a charge of either minus one-third or
plus two-thirds.
The unit charge on an electron has always been assumed to be one of the
fundamental, indivisible units of physics. No particle exists which does not have a
charge that is some exact multiple of it or zero. Yet it was found several years ago
that postulating such a quark would allow a much more elegant and symmetrical
classification of high-energy subatomic particles.
On the basis of the first results of his experiment, Hebard thinks he may have
observed a quark. The quark, if he has indeed found it, resides on a small niobium
ball weighing 70 millionths of a gram on which he has made over 400 observations
during the last eight months.
The ball is floating in a magnetic field. To measure the charge on the ball, he
applies an oscillating electric force which causes the ball to oscillate in turn, with
an amplitude corresponding to its charge.
By moving a radioactive source of positive or negative charge near the ball, he
can add or take away integral units of charge. In each case, to an accuracy of one
in 10, the charge on the ball has been one-third less than an exact number. And a
quark with a charge of either minus one-third or plus two-thirds is one possibility
for the cause of this.
Hebard is not yet convinced that he has seen a quark instead of an
experimental error. "It's still possible that it could be spurious," he says. There are
four more niobium balls which he can place in the same apparatus in the next few
months. If some have a one-third charge and others zero, he will have conclusive
proof that a quark exists.
Fairbank is not sure the results will be so clear, though. "All the quarks that
have been discovered, have been discovered when an experiment was first begun,"
he warns. But he Ls convinced that his techniques will provide the best chance of
success.
Low temperature physics is the tool which allows him to make the sensitive
measurements he needs. A "low" temperature in his jargon, is no more than five
degrees above absolute zero, the lowest temperature conceivable.
"If you think about it,"says Fairbank, who has made several significant
discoveries in the field, "It's probably the dullest place in the world." The random
motion caused by thermal agitation practically disappears. Chemical reactions

cannot take place. But at the same time, an electric current in some metals will
never die out, and they become superconducting.
These special properties make it possible for Fairbank to do many experiments
that were previously impossible. The fact that Arthur Hebard's apparatus is kept
at superconducting temperatures in liquid helium allows him to make his niobium

ball "float" on a magnetic field. The electric currents set up in the ball by the
magnetic field tend to create a force which balances the pull of gravity.
Fairbank has begun to diversify the applications of low temperature work to
experiments on a basic nature in other areas of physics. In a recent interview, he
stressed the importance of this because he feels that "Physics is one of the major
liberal arts subjects." In order for it to remain as such, it must constantly be a sort
of frontier.
Each human being has a demand that cannot be satisfied by food and shelter
alone, he says."It involves the kinds of things one solves by doing research. It
used to be solved by a frontier, but the frontiers are gone. Each human being
wants to be creative—the unlimited frontier is research."
One of his graduate students, Terry Jach, comments on the philosophy of these
experiments as follows: "It's pretty well accepted that finer measurements will
find a violation of a physical law. That's how physics proceeds."
One practical application of this philosophy is an experiment to test Einstein's
theory of gravitation to a very high accuracy. According to the theory, space is
curved under the influence of a large mass. Thus, a gyroscope orbiting around the
earth would not keep the same orientation. Under the influence of the drag of the
earth's gravity, it would turn slowly to one side.
Currently there are other theories of gravitation which predict results differing
from Einstein's by as much as ten percent. The experimental package, which will
be protected from the earth's magnetic field by a superconducting shield, will not
go into orbit for a few years.
The cost of developing the gravitation experiment comes from a NASA grant.
Other work done under Fairbank thus year will be chiefly funded by about
$300,000 from the Air Force and $50,000 from the National Science Foundation.
The search for a quark is an example of the kind of work being done under the
Air Force grant. Fairbank feels there should be no stigma in receiving research
funds from the Defense Department. "Our research is not being done for any
military objective but for the knowledge that comes from it,"he said. He chooses
the projects himself, and it is obvious that he "can't know that it will never be
used by DoD."
For him it is important that the research is completely public and that it is
appropriate for a University. "When the Air Force spends money on basic research
the benefits from that will not in general be direct benefits to the Air Force," says
Fairbank. "There will be benefits to everyone."
Speaking of physicists in general, he has the opinion that, "We are not
interested in blowing people up. We're not really even interested in ecology. We're
interested in finding out what id hidden in nature."
As he looks at it, "One has to realize that his ideas are just as good as anybody
else's ideas in the world. A new student doesn't realize that it's really possible to
have an idea that someone hasn't had. They think the great minds of the world
must have already thought of them. And that's not necessarily true."

WHERE'S THAT QUARK?—Nowhere to be seen for the moment. But strip away
those wires, unbelt the top of the insulated cannister, wait for the liquid nitrogen
and helium to blow off, and deep inside you'll find a barely visible niobium ball.
No one is sure if a quark isn't sitting there. So? It probably doesn't know you're
out there either.
