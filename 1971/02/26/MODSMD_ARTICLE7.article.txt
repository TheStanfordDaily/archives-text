After a period of uncertainty,
the American-South Vietnamese
campaign in Laos once again
makes it clear that the United
States is trying to win the war in
Indochina. When one uses the
word "win" in connection with
this war, it is necessary to specify
exactly what one means.
Our objective in going into
Vietnam was to help a government
fight its enemies until it could
stand on its own. Attaining this
objective, and nothing more than
this objective, is what it would
mean for the United States to
"win" in Indochina.
It is this objective that has
eluded us for a decade, and it is
this objective that President
Nixon seems to be still pursuing
by extending the war into Laos.
This, apparently, is what he is
talking about when he uses the
code words "peace with honor."
"Honor" here means winning.
The real difference between a
dove and a hawk is not that dove
wants the war to stop and a hawk
wants it to continue; it is that a
dove wants to get us out of
Indochina, whether the Saigon
government collapses or not, and
the hawk doesn't want to leave
until the Saigon government is
strong enough to stand on its
own.
We Will Stay
In saying that the President
remains a hawk, no-one is
suggesting that he loves war or
hates peace, or that he wants our
troops to stay in Indochina just
because he likes having them
there. One is saying that, whatever
he may want, he will end up
keeping our armed forces in
Indochina because he is unwilling

to give up trying to achieve the
objectives this country has failed
for ten years to achieve.
This is not something that the
Administration always readily
admits to. It claims that the
campaign in Cambodia and Laos
are designed to protect our forces
as we evacuate them, but this is
almost self-evidently not the case.
Our troops could leave speedily
and safely without first attacking
all the neighboring countries. The
real purpose of these new military
campaigns is to insure the survival
of the Saigon government, not
because we are leaving by in order
that we may leave and this is
precisely the policy that the
United States pursued under two
presidents before President Nixon.
Does this mean, then, that
after several years in which it
seemed plausible that the United
States had changed its policy we
have returned to the situation in
1967, when President Johnson
was still convinced that the war
could be won by military
measures? Unfortunately, it
appears that we are actually in a
more discouraging position than
we were then.
A Cumulative Breakdown
What we see around us is a
breakdown - or, rather, the
evidence of a cumulative
breakdown. It is a breakdown of
Constitutional restrictions, public
debate, and political action, and
also a breakdown of will,
judgement, and moral scruple. In
short, it represents an extreme -
although not, one trusts, final -
constraints that a free people
exercises over its war machine and
its leaders.
In Congress, in the press, and
all over the country, there is a
numbness, and even a paralysis,
among the people from whom one

might expect leadership in this
current crisis.
In 1967, with each escalation
of the war, one could expect a
stiffening of the opposition. Each
new move called forth a fresh
response. In 1967, also, one could
expect that as politicians and the
public learned more about the
dangers of the war, and as the
stories of crimes committed by
Americans in Indochina
multiplied, the public's revulsion
against the war would deepen, and
would perhaps serve, in the end,
to get us out.
It seemed then that there were
certain obstacles to the new
escalations - certain principles in
the Constitution, certain limits to
the abuse that Congress was
willing to take, and certain simple
standards of decency that most
Americans shared.
Obstacles Faced and Crushed
But now it seems that all these
obstacles have been faced and
crushed. Two new borders have
been crossed, the bombing of
North Vietnam has been
intermittently resumed, and the
entire nation knows that, except
for nuclear war and genocide,
there is no crime that the
Americans have not committed in
Indochina.
Our B-5 2's range freely across
the newly violated borders. When
a B-52 strikes, it leaves a path of
craters a mile long. In the month
before the Laos campaign, there
were roughly 6,000 B-52 strikes
throughout Indochina...
The Administration's degree of
success in this can be judged from
the fact that few men in Congress
or elsewhere challenged the
Administration's statement that
the incursion into Laos was not a
"widening of the war."
But if it was not a widening of
the war, then what would be a
widening of the war?
As for the press, it seemed so
preoccupied with the "news
embargo" that it presented the
actual move into Laos almost as a
footnote.
Everywhere, except in Vietnam
itself, where energetic
preparations for the new move
were under way, Americans
seemed dispirited and tired. It is
as though expansion of the war
had been accepted as a natural
law, like gravity, which no-one
can control and only madmen
would consider opposing...
Doesn't the record show that
our Presidents and their advisers
and our generals and all our other
leaders who have "run" this war
have been trapped in isolation and

in ignorance of the war, their
judgement destroyed by the flood
of spurious "information" given
them by overfinanced armed
bureaucracies that had gone wild
in a part of the world no
bureaucracy understood?...
Now it appears that, in our
weariness, the rest of us are in
danger of succumbing to the
hypnotic effect of the
self-propogandizing machine that
has put our leaders to sleep, one
by one.
The Victory of Momentum
Perhaps there are a few people
in the White House, or in the
Pentagon, who regard the opening
of this new campaign, and the
silence that has greeted it
throughout the country, as a
triumph for their point of view.
What has happened, however, is
not that the Administration has
won something and its opponent
have lost something. What has
happened is that a war that
no-one, â€¢ not even the most
belligerent hawks - ever wanted,
or even imagined, has won a
victory over America.
This is not really a victory of
one point of view over another; it
is a victory of momentum over all
points of view, a victory of
violence over restraint, a victory
of fatigue over vigilance and
control.
The events of the last two
weeks represent the subjugation
of men by impersonal forces and
the transformation of human
organizations into blind machines,
which have got out of control.
It is something like a death of
the spirit. This is no person's hour
of triumph. This is the hour of the
B-52. The B-52 has its
shadow over Indochina, and over
America, too. It has thrown off its
harnesses, its victims have no
place to hide, and its keepers are
asleep.
