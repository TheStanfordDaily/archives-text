# faculty stance on anything?
## Days Of Dissent: David To Bruce 
###

Stanford in 1966 had just witnessed what for it
constituted a "revolution" in student body
politics. A bearded, bushy-haired, intense young
student had just completed a campaign for the
student body presidency, not in the traditional
fashion of speaking at fraternity houses, but rather
by taking his campaign to "the people in the
streets."
At that time, who "the people in the streets"
amounted to was the Stanford student body going
to lunch through White Memorial Plaza, that
pleasant walk past the fountain. Stanfordites in
shirtsleeve and tie found themselves stopping en
masse to listen to this young man speaking about
the possibilities for creative social change within
the system. Besides, this was "new" to The Farm.
Postcard-Pix
It was the first time anyone had thought to use
White Memorial Plaza for anything other than
postcard pictures.
That young man was soon to become nationally
famous. First, as the "first" student body
president to resign from said office while at
Stanford, thereby establishing a precedent soon to
be followed by Peter Lyman and others. Then,
that same young man was to organize within the
Peninsula and then the Bay Area that group of
young people who grew into a national body. The
Resistance—dedicated in principle to non-violent
protest against the then-Vietnam Conflict.
David Harris was the symbol of their machismo.
Harris appeared at any number of meetings and
rallies, speaking quietly and urgently to fellow
draft resisters, all easily identifiable by a common
dislike for U.S. actions in South Vietnam. Harris
came to epitomize what we now know as radical
student protest "pre-Weatherman and FCM" when
he voluntarily submitted himself to three years'
imprisonment in the Federal penitentiary for
conscientious objection to the war.
His objection was based, as we who found
ourselves on the fringes of mainstream society
came to see, on the conviction that the
hypocritical action was far more damaging to the
soul, that silence in the face of wrong was an
indictment of the human condition but even more
specifically white American society. To this end,
he not only campaigned against the war effort as
many students today are now doing, David went
one step better.
He talked with his "elders," the professors of
this institution. And when I use that word
"talked," it is precisely what I mean for David had
learned a valuable lesson—that it is in the interest
of the dissenter to be able to communicate with
the other side, that communication does not
impute some compromising in one's moral stance.
But I did not choose to write this column in
praise of David Harris. And I mean it as no hymn
to either Bruce Franklin or what is happening to
Bruce as a result of what has been a four-year
effort on his part to bring some bullshit (i.e.,
"bourgeoise") social consciousness to this school.
The Coming of Bruce
For you see, I remember when first coming to
this school in September, 1966, a time when there
were few black students on the campus (33 to be
exact and no black administrators!) and reading on

the front page of this same Daily where Professor
Franklin was being lauded as that "bright,
imaginative young man in the English
Department." Bruce also made that year's Palo
Alto Times, again on the merits of his youthful
appointment to the faculty as his "sharp-witted
insights" were accoladed by many in the Stanford
community as an indication that the English
Department was not totally lost in a love affair
with the formalistic poetry of the now-deceased
Yvor Winters or the soulless Western landscapes of
Wallace Stegner.
Shaved Heads
The same year that David Harris was student
body president, for instance, a group of Delts
ganged up on the man one night and clipped his
"long hair" off—shaved his head bald. The kind of
behavior that good solid jocks in such places as the
University of Wyoming or BYU would heartily
approve of. That is, until Harris made an issue of
it, until this young man made that "butch haircut"
come to have more meaning for his constituency
than the by-now classic profile of your bearded
Bohemian.
Bruce, on the other hand, was just getting his
feet wet in Stanford politics at the time. Teaching,
or thinking about teaching an Undergraduate
Special in Marxism and Leninism. Yours truly,
along with Art Wilson, now a graduate student
at-large but then a freshman from Los Angeles,
were the "vociferous blacks on the
Farm"—speaking out in White Plaza on the
shootout in Oakland between the Oakland Police
Department and a young black by the name of
Huey who would gain tos own sort of national
prominence. V
Stanford was a different kind of school then, as
opposed to both its earlier years and now. You
had people before you who iiad never had contact
with a black unless it was ihe cook in the frat
house or the janitor one saw in Tresidder Union.
"Poor Richard"
Richard Lyman was a young man on the make.
You almost knew he had administrative
aspirations, but as to when "Poor Richard" would
ever achieve them was anybody's guess (the
sudden departure from office of Kenneth Pitzer
solved that conundrum. It was as if Lyman became
President by default). And S.I. Hayakawa was still
teaching semantics. That might all sound just a bit
like ancient history to you but it was Stanford and
it was the 1960's about to go iijto a tailspin as this
country's youth began reordering their own
priorities to meet those lessons they were learning
in the Humanities and which were being taught in
the rice paddies by the Vietnamese.
We have come a long way since then, since the
initial repression of David Harris and the
appearance on campus of a youthful Bruce
Franklin. We have graduated to the point where
students can be shot, where manifestoes are issued
everyday (Rome took longer than a day to burn!).
Then, as now, I still find myself wondering just
where the faculty of this school stands—whether
on anything at all.
Repression is an easy act to follow.
