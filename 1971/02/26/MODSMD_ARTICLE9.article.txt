## Confessions Of An FCM Pig

' frank moore

My career as a vigilante began
last April with the annual riot
season; visions of apocalypse
danced through my head as
Conservatives were beaten up,
buildings firebombed, and the
University brought to a standstill.
Thinking that the University, the
nation, and the world was at a
crisis, I banded together with a
handful of the most stubborn and
brave people at Leland Stanford
Junior University, the Free
Campus Movement.
Together we stood in front of
the Old Union the day it was
liberated, put out firebombs,
dodged rocks and two-by-fours,
and were put up against the wall
at Encina Hall. The whole
business made my knees shake
and my stomach queasy, but it all
seemed worthwhile, because I felt
that I was defending the country
and the University.

When May brought apathy and
a slackening off of goings-on, I
realized that "the Movement" was
no threat to the nation as a whole,
owing to its lack of organization
and discipline, not to mention
numbers. But I still hung around
the Free Market to help defend
the University.
The funny thing was that the
University felt no inclination to
defend itself. When the Old Union
was liberated, a mere thirty
Conservatives were around to hold
it, with not a campus cop in sight.
Funnier still, the Administration
threatened to haul us, the
defenders of their building, in
front of the S.J.C. for disruptive
behavior, or some such other
ridiculous charge. Through out
the rest of the season the
administration showed no
willingness to clear their facilities,

save for the clumsily executed and
belated Old Union bust.
Since then, consistent with
their do-nothing policy, they have
refused to keep "open" meetings
open, have failed to protect their
students from the activities of the
liberators, and have generally
satisfied themselves with pitting
fanatic against fanatic to save
their own pasty necks: even if the
F.C.M.'s deterent value was
negligible, if nothing else we
deserved to draw some of the ire
of the radicals away from the
fat-cat liberals in charge. Needless
to say, I became sick of doing the
University's dirty work, without
any measure of support or
appreciation.
A lot of human, as well as
political problems grew out of my
role as a vigilante; fear and hate
infected me and grew until the
"enemy" became faceless and
inhuman. Even politically
moderate friends wanted little to
do with me, and one night my
girlfriend asked me, "Frank, why
must you always go against the
will of the people."
It still would all have been
worthwhile, if moderate elements
in and out of the administration
had united to restore some
measure of sanity, but no, the
professors sat in their leather
chairs, drinking Scotch and water
and mumbled "deplorable,
deplorable!"
I'm tired. I realize that the
radicals pose little threat to the
nation as a whole ... even the
bombings are of little importance,
when one realizes that America
has survived a hundred years of
bombings and burnings of Black
churches, homes and farms in the
South.
If anyone is threatened, it is
the complacent liberal professors
and administrators in Academia
who must worry about finishing
their scatological "publish or
perish" papers. As for this chile,
when the rocks and bottles start
flying past faculty club, I'm
gonna Keep On Truckin'!

My career as a vigilante began
last April with the annual riot
season; visions of apocalypse
danced through my head as
Conservatives were beaten up,
buildings firebombed, and the
University brought to a standstill.
Thinking that the University, the
nation, and the world was at a
crisis, I banded together with a
handful of the most stubborn and
brave people at Leland Stanford
Junior University, the Free
Campus Movement.
Together we stood in front of
the Old Union the day it was
liberated, put out firebombs,
dodged rocks and two-by-fours,
and were put up against the wall
at Encina Hall. The whole
business made my knees shake
and my stomach queasy, but it all
seemed worthwhile, because I felt
that I was defending the country
and the University.

When May brought apathy and
a slackening off of goings-on, I
realized that "the Movement" was
no threat to the nation as a whole,
owing to its lack of organization
and discipline, not to mention
numbers. But I still hung around
the Free Market to help defend
the University.
The funny thing was that the
University felt no inclination to
defend itself. When the Old Union
was liberated, a mere thirty
Conservatives were around to hold
it, with not a campus cop in sight.
Funnier still, the Administration
threatened to haul us, the
defenders of their building, in
front of the S.J.C. for disruptive
behavior, or some such other
ridiculous charge. Through out
the rest of the season the
administration showed no
willingness to clear their facilities,

save for the clumsily executed and
belated Old Union bust.
Since then, consistent with
their do-nothing policy, they have
refused to keep "open" meetings
open, have failed to protect their
students from the activities of the
liberators, and have generally
satisfied themselves with pitting
fanatic against fanatic to save
their own pasty necks: even if the
F.C.M.'s deterent value was
negligible, if nothing else we
deserved to draw some of the ire
of the radicals away from the
fat-cat liberals in charge. Needless
to say, I became sick of doing the
University's dirty work, without
any measure of support or
appreciation.
A lot of human, as well as
political problems grew out of my
role as a vigilante; fear and hate
infected me and grew until the
"enemy" became faceless and
inhuman. Even politically
moderate friends wanted little to
do with me, and one night my
girlfriend asked me, "Frank, why
must you always go against the
will of the people."
It still would all have been
worthwhile, if moderate elements
in and out of the administration
had united to restore some
measure of sanity, but no, the
professors sat in their leather
chairs, drinking Scotch and water
and mumbled "deplorable,
deplorable!"
I'm tired. I realize that the
radicals pose little threat to the
nation as a whole ... even the
bombings are of little importance,
when one realizes that America
has survived a hundred years of
bombings and burnings of Black
churches, homes and farms in the
South.
If anyone is threatened, it is
the complacent liberal professors
and administrators in Academia
who must worry about finishing
their scatological "publish or
perish" papers. As for this chile,
