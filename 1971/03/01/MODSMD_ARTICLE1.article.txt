# A 						Team Effort:
## Computer System Monitors Surgery 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Scientists from fields as diverse as
biostatistics and systems engineering
are combining their efforts in an
outstanding example of academic
brotherhood, to develop a system that
will eventually allow a single
anesthesiologist, aided by a computer,
to simultaneously monitor the progress
of perhaps a dozen surgical patients.
The project is officially dubbed
"Health Services Demonstration
Grant—Demonstration Project
Computer Monitoring (Surgical)," and
is funded by the Health Services and
Mental Health Administration of the
U.S. Public Health Service, to the tune
of $230,000 per year.
The money helps support more than
17 researchers from the School of
Medicine and the School of
Engineering. They hope to develop
within the next five years a
computer-aided system that will help
alleviate the critical shortage of clinical
anesthesiologists.
In the United States today, only one
in four surgical procedures have
anesthesiologists delivering anesthesia;
computer monitoring of selected
physiological variables and television
views of the operating room can
provide an anesthesiologist with
information sufficient to safely
supervise the anesthetic care for several
cases simultaneously.
Thus a team of two
anesthesiologists, supported by one
anesthesia assistant per patient, could
provide the presence of an
anesthesiologist during the critical
periods of induction and arousal and at
any other time of danger. During
periods of maintenance anesthesia one
anesthesiologist at a TV-computer
display console could function as a
controller, monitoring all cases and
directing the other anesthesiologist to
situations of special need.
Early Stage
It is hoped that this system would
not only alleviate the anesthesia
manpower problem and lower
anesthesia care costs, but the care it
would provide would actually exceed
the quality of care now available.

At this point, the system is relatively
primitive, having just been tested for
the first time in an actual surgical
situation several weeks ago. Operating
Room 1 4, on the second floor of the
Stanford Hospital, has been modified
to accommodate the special equipment
required by the project. A
TV-computer display has been installed
in the operating room and in a small
control room next door.
The computer itself is located more
than three-quarters of a mile away, in a
basement of the Durand Space
Engineering Building.
Although the scientists working on
the project are excited about the fact
that after one year they have finally
gotten the system "on the air," the
work in patient monitoring is just
beginning. At present, the doctors and
engineers are able to view
computer-generated displays showing
such variables as heart rate and RK
interval (the time between the brachial
pulse and the R wave of the electroen
cephalograph.Various sensors are taped
to the patient's skin, and a
blood-pressure cuff is wrapped about
the arm. The patients have all

undergone abdominal surgery, as the
ECG (electrocardiagram) transducers
must be attached to the chest, and the
EEG (electroencephalogram) sensors
must be attached to the head, making
monitored surgery in these areas at
least for now, impossible.
One of the things that the
experimenters hope to determine is
which physiological variables will be of
the most use to the remote
anesthesiologist.
That such a project requires a
certain amount of interdisciplinary
communication is obvious, but the
rapport that exists between the doctors
and the engineers is rather exceptional
The engineers are learning to speak the
language of medicine, the doctors are
learning to talk engineering, and both
groups seem to be enjoying it
immensely.
The interaction between diverse
disciplines is something that is often
spoken of at Stanford, but is seldom
seen. Dr. Roy B. Rubin, a postdoctoral
Research Fellow in the Department of
Anesthesia, believes that the special
rapport that has developed on this

operating room is equipped for computer monitoring of patients under-going surgery. The doctor in the foreground is

computer-generated displays that instantly give him vital information on the patient's condition.
