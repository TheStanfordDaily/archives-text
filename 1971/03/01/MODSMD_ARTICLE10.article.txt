# Human Biology Courses Added
## 
### 
Four new courses have been
announced by the Program in
Human Biology. Human Biology
110, Introduction to
Biochemistry (3 units TTH 4:15
p.m. Room 84) will be taught by
Nicholas Hoogenraad and Rodney
Levine and is designed for
students who do not plan to take
advanced courses in either
Chemistry or Biochemistry.
Human Nutrition (H.B. 120,3
units, TTH 3:15-4:05 p.m.) will
be taught by Professors
Kretchmer and Robertson and
will focus on the requirements
and problems of human Nutrition.
Professor Cavalli-Sforza will teach
Human Genetics (H.B. 130, MWF
2:15-3:05 p.m., 4 units) which
will include a general introduction
to genetics coupled with more

detailed studies of genes and their
significance.
Human Biology 140, Energy
Utilization and the Environment
taught by Professor Sidney Liebes
(MWF 8:00 p.m., 4 units) will
deal with basic energy concepts,
the flow of energy, and the
utilization of energy. All courses
have ceilings of 4 0 students
except H.B. 140. Students not
Human Biology majors will be
admitted only with the consent of
the instructors.
The Program also announced a
new grading policy where all core
courses are to be taken for grades
and up to 15 units of upper
division courses may be taken
pass/fail. A student receiving an A
in three core courses may take the
remainder of his courses in
Human Biology pass/fail.
