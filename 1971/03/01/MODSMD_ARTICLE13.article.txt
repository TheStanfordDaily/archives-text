# Reds Smash State; Downed By Ducks
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In two years of varsity
basketball at Stanford, Claude
Terry has been on the winning
team only 11 times in 4 9 games.
But if it weren't for 'Ferry, the
record would probably be even
worse.
Over those two years, he has
poured in 997 points and become
one of the finest guards in
Stanford history. The all-time
career record of 1,4 41 points Is
well within his reach, as is the
single season record of 54 0. Terry
needs only 35 points to erase the
latter mark, set by Art Harris in
1968.
Last weekend, the 6-5 junior
guard has possibly the finest
weekend of his career as he scored
7 7 points and led the Indians to
one upset and almost two.
Led by Terry's 41 points on
Friday night, the Cards dumped
Oregon State 97-85, but Oregon
beat them 8 0-75 the next night.
In the two games, Terry hit on
26 of 44 field goals, 25 of 34 free
throws and also tallied 7 assists
and 14 rebounds. His field goals
came on a fine combination of
long outside jumpers, and dazzling
inside hooks and layups.
Friday night Stanford came up
with possibly their finest effort of
the year in beating the Beavers.
The lead changed hands 1 7 times
before the Indians went ahead for
good at 6 5-€4. The Cards ran off
19 of the next 27 points and
coasted to a win for the first time
this season.
Four other players finished in
double figures to help Terry out.
Mike Michel had 13, Pat Rusco
had 11, and Larry Rosenzweig
and Bob Buell both added 10.
Terry's 41 point performance
broke the Maples Pavilion single
game scoring record.

Saturday night, Stanford made
it interesting, but they could
never quite overtake Oregon down
the stretch. After trailing by nine
at half time, the Cards closed to
within one point three times, but
they could never tie it up.
Chuck Moore got a tip-in to
make it 64-63 with 6:47 to go,
but Oregon hit on 8 of 11 free
throws to Stanford's none from
there to the finish, to win the
game at the foul line.
Terry again led all scorers with
36 points. Larry Rosenzweig
added 11 points and 16 rebounds
in another fine effort. But his
Oregon counterpart, 6-9 center
Stan Love, proved to be the
winning factor with a 34 point
performance. 6-5 guard Bill
Drozdiak added 15 points for the
Ducks.


FRESHMAN POWER-Alex Mayer from Woodmeie, New York,
volleyed served his way to the Northern California Intercollegiate
singles title here Saturday by clobbering Carlos Kirmayr of Brazil 6-1,
6-4 in the finals. Mayer is the second Stanford freshman to win the
NorCal crown in as many years. Remember Roscoe?

latter mark, set by Art Harris in
1968.
Last weekend, the 6-5 junior
guard has possibly the finest
weekend of his career as he scored
7 7 points and led the Indians to
one upset and almost two.
Led by Terry's 41 points on
Friday night, the Cards dumped
Oregon State 97-85, but Oregon
beat them 8 0-75 the next night.
In the two games, Terry hit on
26 of 44 field goals, 25 of 34 free
throws and also tallied 7 assists
and 14 rebounds. His field goals
came on a fine combination of
long outside jumpers, and dazzling
inside hooks and layups.
Friday night Stanford came up
with possibly their finest effort of
the year in beating the Beavers.
The lead changed hands 1 7 times
before the Indians went ahead for
good at 6 5-€4. The Cards ran off
19 of the next 27 points and
coasted to a win for the first time
this season.
Four other players finished in
double figures to help Terry out.
Mike Michel had 13, Pat Rusco
had 11, and Larry Rosenzweig
and Bob Buell both added 10.
Terry's 41 point performance
broke the Maples Pavilion single
game scoring record.

Saturday night, Stanford made
it interesting, but they could
never quite overtake Oregon down
the stretch. After trailing by nine
at half time, the Cards closed to
within one point three times, but
they could never tie it up.
Chuck Moore got a tip-in to
make it 64-63 with 6:47 to go,
but Oregon hit on 8 of 11 free
throws to Stanford's none from
there to the finish, to win the
game at the foul line.
Terry again led all scorers with
36 points. Larry Rosenzweig
added 11 points and 16 rebounds
in another fine effort. But his
Oregon counterpart, 6-9 center
Stan Love, proved to be the
winning factor with a 34 point
performance. 6-5 guard Bill
Drozdiak added 15 points for the
Ducks.


FRESHMAN POWER-Alex Mayer from Woodmeie, New York,
volleyed served his way to the Northern California Intercollegiate
singles title here Saturday by clobbering Carlos Kirmayr of Brazil 6-1,
6-4 in the finals. Mayer is the second Stanford freshman to win the
NorCal crown in as many years. Remember Roscoe?
In two years of varsity
basketball at Stanford, Claude
Terry has been on the winning
team only 11 times in 4 9 games.
But if it weren't for 'Ferry, the
record would probably be even
worse.
Over those two years, he has
poured in 997 points and become
one of the finest guards in
Stanford history. The all-time
career record of 1,4 41 points Is
well within his reach, as is the
single season record of 54 0. Terry
needs only 35 points to erase the
latter mark, set by Art Harris in
1968.
