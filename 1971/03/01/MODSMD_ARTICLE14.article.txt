# Mayer Takes Title
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford captured the team
and both individual titles in the
19 71 Northern California
Intercollegiates here on Saturday.
The Tribe garnered 30 team
points to bury its nearest rivals,
Cal with 20 and San Jose State
with 19.
Third-seeded Stanford
freshman Alex Mayer surprised
veteran opponents as he won the
NorCal singles crown by
overwhelming San Jose's Carlos
Kirmayr in the finals 6-1,6-4.
Coach Dick Gould said he "was
really pleased with Mayer and the
whole team. It was good for
Sandy (Mayer) to show what he
could do."
Earlier, Mayer whipped Cal's

top two singles players in the
quarter and semi-finals. After
defeating Larry Parker to reach
the semis, Mayer downed
second-seeded Cal ace Bob Alloo
7-5,7-5.
In other singles play, Gerry
Groslimond bested Berkeley's
Mike Mullan in the third round
"very decisively," according to
Coach Gould.
Defending champion Roscoe
Tanner fell in the semi-finals to
Kirmayr. According to Gould,
"Kirmayr was extremely fast and
played the best tennis I've ever
seen him play. Roscoe will face
him twice more this season in dual
meets and I wouldn't bet against
Roscoe."
After double-faulting three
times in the first game, Tanner
lost his serve and the first set 6-3.
In the second set, Roscoe
perservered five Kirmayr match
points but lost a chance to break
through at 10-10. Finally, he
dropped his serve and the set
15-13.
In the doubles, the Indians
were invincible. In an all-Stanford
final, Tanner and Mayer defeated
teammates Rick Fisher and Gerry
Groslimond 6-4,6-2.
But Coach Gould was most
gratified with his tandems'
outstanding success in semi-final
action. Tanner and Mayer opened
the onslaught by smashing Cal's
premier pair, third-seeded Bob
Alloo and Steve Stefanki, 6-2,6-4.
In the spirit of the racket-axe,
Gould grinned, "We just killed
'em."
