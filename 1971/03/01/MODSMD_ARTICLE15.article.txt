# Kammeyer Hurls Shutout
## Tribe Drops Two 
### TOM QUINN 
Stanford's baseball Indians
found the road a little rough last
weekend, dropping two of three
games to Santa Clara and Fresno
State. On Friday, the Indians fell,
8-5, to the Broncos in Buck Shaw
Stadium in Santa Clara, but on
Saturday at Fresno Stanford
salvaged a split with a 1 -0 victory
in the eleventh inning after
dropping the first game, 2 -0.
Bob Kanneyer turned in an
excellent performance in the
nightcap, pitching the whole
eleven innings and limiting Fresno
to eight hits. The winning run was
driven home by Rod Boone with a
single up the middle. Mike Nelson
led off with a single and then was
moved along to second with a
sacrifice bunt. When Phil Kelber
tried to sacrifice him to third,
Nelson was thrown out. However,
freshman Mark Lucich walked and
Boone came through with the
crucial hit.
The fielding lapse that has
plagued the Indians throughout
the season was remedied in the
second game when coach Ray
Young brought shortstop A 1
O'Brien up from the freshman
team and moved Dave Edson to
second. The duo turned in three
double plays and a measure of
stability to the middle.
Young felt that the leaky
infield was the difference in
Saturday first loss. "We were only
credited with three errors, but it
should have been about seven.
We're usually a good hitting club,
but so many mistakes in the
infield had to affect our
concentration at the plate."
As a result, Dan Shaw lost a
heartbreaker as Stanford
produced a meager three hits.
Fresno's pitcher whom Young
rated as the best he's seen in the
area, lengthened his shutout

streak to 27 straight innings in
subduing the Indians, 2 -0 .
On Friday, Santa Clara hit
Stanford hard from the first
inning and actually put the game
out of reach by the third frame.
Rod Boone suffered his first loss
of the season, giving up all eight
runs in his four inning stint.
The Indians pounded out nine
hits and drove home five runs, but
fielding lapses once again coupled
with a 13-hit attack by Santa
Clara to ice the 8 -5 defeat.
