project is a result of many factors,
some of them quite fortuitous, such as
the fact that the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories are situated within
comfortable walking distance of the
Medical School.
But there are other reasons why the
doctors and engineers get along so well.
According to Dr. Rubin, "There is a
large body of staff, in the Anesthesia
Department particularly, who have had
previous training or interest in
engineering."
Dr. Delmar Snider, the Clinical
Coordinator for the project, has as MS
in engineering and practiced as an
engineer for four years before he
entered medical school; Dr. Bellville
was an electronics technician in World
War 11. "With people like that in the
Department," says Dr. Rubin, "it's
natural that there should be a good
liaison between the engineers and the
doctors.
"The engineers, on the other hand,
men like Dr. Weaver (Engineering
Coordinator for the Project) have been
engaged in medical projects for a
number of years themselves, and have
familiarized themselves already to a
very large extent with the basics of
cardiovascular physiology, so that
coming into the hospital is certainly
nothing strange for them.
"Then the rest is just the personality
factors, the fact that somebody like
Floyd Brown (Systems Engineer for the
Project) was enthusiastic enough to
come over and spend every operating
day for six months in the operating
room so that he familiarized himself

with the procedure. For somebody
who's a pure computer scientist this is
quite an input of time and effort. It
pays off in everybody understanding
what everybody else is doing."
Ultimately, it is hoped that the
computer can be programmed to
recognize abnormal patient reactions
and send out warning signals to the
monitoring anesthesiologist. But right
now the computer simply displays
whatever variable is requested by the
operator, and a full-scale patieui
monitoring system that will deliver
adequate surgical care to all patients
lives only in the dreams of a score of
Stanford scientists.

But there are other reasons why the
doctors and engineers get along so well.
According to Dr. Rubin, "There is a
large body of staff, in the Anesthesia
Department particularly, who have had
previous training or interest in
engineering."
Dr. Delmar Snider, the Clinical
Coordinator for the project, has as MS
in engineering and practiced as an
engineer for four years before he
entered medical school; Dr. Bellville
was an electronics technician in World
War 11. "With people like that in the
Department," says Dr. Rubin, "it's
natural that there should be a good
liaison between the engineers and the
doctors.
"The engineers, on the other hand,
men like Dr. Weaver (Engineering
Coordinator for the Project) have been
engaged in medical projects for a
number of years themselves, and have
familiarized themselves already to a
very large extent with the basics of
cardiovascular physiology, so that
coming into the hospital is certainly
nothing strange for them.
"Then the rest is just the personality
factors, the fact that somebody like
Floyd Brown (Systems Engineer for the
Project) was enthusiastic enough to
come over and spend every operating
day for six months in the operating
room so that he familiarized himself

with the procedure. For somebody
who's a pure computer scientist this is
quite an input of time and effort. It
pays off in everybody understanding
what everybody else is doing."
Ultimately, it is hoped that the
computer can be programmed to
recognize abnormal patient reactions
and send out warning signals to the
monitoring anesthesiologist. But right
now the computer simply displays
whatever variable is requested by the
operator, and a full-scale patieui
monitoring system that will deliver
adequate surgical care to all patients
lives only in the dreams of a score of
Stanford scientists.
