NLRB Suit
An unfair labor practice suit has been filed with
the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) by
United Stanford Employees (USE) charging Stanford
University with illegally using the state courts to stop
all forms of organizing by employees.
The suit charges that, "Since on or about Feb. 1 2,
1971, the above named employer has interfered with,
restrained and coerced its employees in the exercise
of the rights guaranteed in section 7 of the Act,
(National Labor Relations Act), by suing for a state
court preliminary injunction which would forbid,
inter alia, certain employees and union organizers
from engaging in union solicitation and distribution
contrary to rights guaranteed under the Act.
Curtail Rights
"Said state court order would, in addition, illegally
curtail the right of employees to strike and the right
of employees and union members and organizers to
picket over disputes concerning wages, hours and
working conditions, for informational purposes,
and/or for organizational or recognitional purposes,
and would further make illegal the very discussion
among employees and organizers of such strikes or
picketing, all in derogation of rights guaranteed by
sections 7 and 13 of the Act."
Under clauses 7 and 8 of the Preliminary
Injunction filed by the Santa Clara courts at the
request of the University, it would be illegal for any
group of people to gather together to discuss any
form of action to be taken against the university
whether legal or illegal, and it would also be illegal for
any named member of Venceremos to set foot on the
Stanford Campus unless registered as a student.
Innocents Banned
There are a number of campus employees
belonging to Venceremos who have never been

arrested, convicted, or cited for any crimes.
According to James H. Wolpman, attorney for USE
who submitted the charge against the University,
"Forbidding these workers from coming to Stanford
is illegal and in violation of the National Labor
Relations Act."
The hearing for the determination of the validity
of clauses 7 and 8 will be held today at 10 :00 a.m. at the
North County Courthouse. If the two clauses are
stricken from the injunction "the University can still
be held liable" under the charge submitted to the
NLRB.
No hearing date for the charge has been set by the
NLRB'
Lindsay March
Twenty Stanford students marched through
downtown San Francisco Friday to help create grass
roots support of New York's Mayor John Lindsay as
the Democratic nominee for president.
"We went down to San Francisco to generate some
enthusiasm for Lindsay's candidacy as a Democrat,"
said Neil Macey, co-chairman of the Lindsay for
President Committee, which currently has 172
members on campus. Lindsay, presently registered as
a Republican, would have to switch parties some time
in the next few months in order to be eligible for the
Democratic primaries next year. Macey believes
Lindsay's political philosophy is more Democratic
than Republican and that he will switch in three or
four weeks.
Arriving at Union Square by bus at9:ls a.m., the
students held a press conference and then marched to
Crocker Plaza, where they dispersed to pre-assigned
street corners in the financial district. They passed
out 1 4,000 leaflets and collected 350 signatures on a
petition urging Lindsay to run.

Anti-War Picket
Nearly 70 persons, including about 10 faculty
wives and their children, Friday peacefully picketed a
campus recruiter for a corporation which
manufactures military hardware used in Southeast
Asia.
The group was protesting interviews being
conducted with industrial and mechanical engineering
students by a representative of KMC Corp., a San
Jose-based firm that manufactures a wide range of
military hardware, including armored personnel
carriers and other "classified projects." These
classified projects may include a "beehive" bomb, a
device that sprays barbed pieces of metal over a wide
area.
There were no incidents and no arrests were
reported during the two-hour demonstration at the
Placement Center, located at the foot of White Plaza.
Two Stanford policemen stood next to the doors to
insure free ingress and egress.
Interviewers and others desiring entrance had no
trouble walking into the building, despite the
presence of six elderly persons who sat down directly
across from the doorway.
The quiet picket line followed a brief, windy rally
during which speakers outlined FMC's contributions
to the Indochinese War effort and to local air
pollution problems.
Sponsors of the demonstration included the New
Left Project, Stanford Women for Peace, and the
Women's International League for Peace and
Freedom. Venceremos and McGovern buttons, as well
as a Veterans Against the Vietnam War hat, were also
visible.
