# Newton, Cleaver Split
## 
### 
A major split has arisen between two
top Black Panther Party leaders,
possibly signifying a deeper division
within the party structure.
Panther Minister of Defense Huey
Newton said Friday that in his opinion,
former party chief Eldridge Cleaver
should be jailed for his remarks about
Panther Chief of Staff David Hilliard
During an early morning television
talk show, Cleaver, on a telephone
linkup from Algeria where he Ls
currently living in exile, charged that
Hilliard was responsible for the
purging of 24 former party members
Concerning the purging Cleaver
commented, "It is our position
here . . . that it is regrettable that such
an action has taken place."
"We lay the responsibility at the feet
of David Hilliard. We demand that

David Hilliard be dismissed or resign."
Newton responded that Hilliard was
not responsible for the purging. "I'm
responsible. I take responsibility,"
replied Newton.
Commenting after the show,
Newton added, "He (Cleaver) found it
necessary to bring that point out in
public first. It was a shock to me and
we will take action against that."
"If the central committee decides
that he will be disciplined,"
commented Newton referring to
Cleaver, "I will recommend that he be
put in jail in our embassy in Algiers."
Cleaver was chief of the Panther
party until 1968 when he fled the
country rather than return to jail as a
parole violator. Newton is currently
head of the party while Hilliard is
second in command.
