# Lyman Specifies Charges: Franklin Incited Violence
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
President Lyman issued detailed
charges against Associate Professor H.
Bruce Franklin Friday night following
Franklin's demand for specifics in his
case.
In a seven-page Statement of
Charges, which would be submitted to
the Chairman of the Advisory Board in
the event that Franklin opted for a
formal hearing, Lyman charged
Franklin with violating the Statement
of Policy on Appointment and Tenure
on four occasions, three of them on
Feb. 10 and gave Franklin until 5:00
p.m. Wednesday, March 3, to decide
whether he wants the case heard by the
Advisory Board.
In an accompanying letter to the
suspended English professor, released
by Franklin to the Daily, Lyman said
that he was issuing the statement in
response to Franklin's request on
Friday for- "greater specificity as to the
charges" filed on February 12.
Belated Request
"Although your request strikes me
as rather belated," Lyman wrote, "I
trust that the enclosed formal charges
will be sufficient for you to determine
whether to demand a hearing."
Franklin argued last night that the
new statement of charges is no more
specific than the old one, and
commented that the length of the legal
docunent is no cover-up for its
vagueness.
In connection with the events of
Wednesday night, February 10, (two
people were shot, one severely beaten,
and 12 arrested) Lyman's statement
charges that "during the course of the
rally Professor Franklin intentionally
urged and incited students and other
persons present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt University
functions and business and which
threatened injury to individuals and
property. Shortly thereafter students
and other persons were assaulted by
persons present at the rally and later
that evening other acts of violence
occurred."
"They're saying that just because I
made a speech, therefore these things
happened," Franklin commented with
some amusement.
He also expressed irritation at the
charge that he had "significantly
interfered with orderly dispersal" at the
Computation Center demonstration on
February 10 "by intentionally urging
and inciting" those present to disobey
the order to disperse.
Franklin maintained that the charge,
besides being vague, is wrong since he
had been arguing at the time with Prof.
Lincoln Moses, Dean of Graduate
Studies, and with the police chief, that
the dispersal order was improper.
Another charge brought against
Franklin is in connection with the
disruption of Henry Cabot Lodge's
speech on campus January 11.
Allegedly, Franklin "knowingly and
intentionally participated in the
disruptive conduct," which resulted in
the cancellation of the program.
Lyman contends that Lodge and the
other scheduled speakers were "denied
their rightful opportunity to be heard,
and members of the audience were
denied their rightful opportunity to
hear and to assembly peacefully," and
that this constitutes a violation of the
Stanford Policy on Campus Disruption.
Franklin has until Wednesday to
decide whether he wants the case

settled by formal hearing before the
Advisory Baord or "by way of
agreement," which would mean that
the disposal of the case would be at
Lyman's discretion.
In an unrelated incident this
weekend, a birthday party given for
Franklin and Venceremos Central
Committee member Aaron Manganiello
was raided by police and resulted in the
arrest of 1 4 persons.
Manganiello, director of Venceremos
College in Redwood City, and Franklin
had left the Friday-night party before
the police arrived. Local authorities had
received a number of complaints about
a loud party.
A squad of 20 San Mateo County
sheriff's deputies raided the house at
12 :15 a.m. after Sgt. ErvinPronske said
those at the party refused to quiet
down at the request of a single deputy,
dispatched to the scene.
Scuffling
When Pronske ordered his men to
begin making arrests, the party-goers
began streaming out of the house to
confront the police, get their badge
numbers, and demand their legal rights.
Some scuffling ensued, and 14 persons,
five of them juveniles, were taken into
custody and charged with disturbing
the peace and contributing to the
delinquency of minors.
Mrs. Susan Mores, wife of Stanford
faculty member, John Flores, and a
community worker from the Peoples
Medical Center, was particularly
vindictive, according to Pronske. She
felled one deputy and struck another
before being subdued by three
policemen.
She was charged with felonious
assault and battery on police officers,
resisting arrest, disturbing the peace,
and contributing to the delinquency of
minors.

Deputies confiscated six guns and a
small quantity of ammunition found in
the house.
Manganiello claimed the deputies
entered the house improperly and
committed "out and out theft" in
confiscating the guns which had been
legally purchased. He also said that
they had rampaged through the house,
ransacking drawers and destroying an
electronic walkie-talkie which was
being assembled by one of the
occupants.
One of those arrested, Douglas
Filene, is a former Stanford student.
Most of the 14 persons are politically
active community workers.

The "show cause" hearing, in which
the University will try to obtain a
preliminary injunction against 17
named defendants and a thousand John
Does to replace the temporary
restraining order now in effect, is slaied
for 9 :00 a.m. this morning at the Santa
Clara County Courthouse.
The students who will be prosecuted
must show cause why they should not
be enjoined from participating in
actions specified in a temporary
restraining order which the University
obtained Feb. 12.
At the first such hearing on
February 18, the defendants were
granted an extension until today.
The injunction, if granted, will
prohibit most disruptive kinds of
demonstrations, and will bar members
of Venceremos from coming on
campus.
Franklin, a member of the Central
Committee of Venceremos, has said
that he will not come on campus to
continue teaching his class if it becomes
illegal for him to do so. He has been
holding class since his suspension on
February 12.
