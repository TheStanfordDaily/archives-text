# Penn State Scheduled For Future Openers
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford will meet Penn State in the
11 th game on their football schedule
for four straight years starting in 1 973.
The first game will be played on
September 15, 1973 in Stanford
Stadiu m.
The next three years, Stanford will
open their season against the Nittany
Lions in University Park, Pennsylvania.
Originally Stanford had tried to get two
home and home sets, but previous
scheduling made this impossible.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director, Robert Young, "We were
unable to set up a home and home set
in '75 and '76, because Penn State had
some problems with the number of
home games back in Pennsylvania.
"We think traditionally that we can
do better away from home that early in
the season, since most students haven't
returned to the campus yet. We haven't
signed the contracts yet, but all the
games have been set up by a letter of
agreement."
Traditionally, one of the strongest
Independents in the country, Penn
State had won 23 straight games before
Colorado beat them 41-13 on October
5, 19 70. Penn State lost two other

games, but still finished 18 th in the
nation with a 7-3 record.
In 1 977, Stanford will meet the
same Colorado team that broke Penn
State's win streak on September 10 in
Boulder, Colorado. Colorado is one of
the stronger teams in the tough Big
Eight conference.
The athletic department had
originally received permission from the
Student-Faculty Athletic Commission
to schedule only through 1 976, but
when the Colorado game became
available, the Commission approved it.
Next year's 11 th game with Missouri
had been approved in January.
Following the game in Missouri,
Stanford will travel to West Point to
meet the Army on September 18th.
Other non-league games next season
will be against Duke and San Jose
State, both at Stanford.
In 1972, Stanford could add a 12th
game, since their present 11 th game,
against Hawaii on December 2nd does
not count as an 11 th game under the
NCAA rules. But Young still does not
think an extra game will be added,
unless "something unusual comes up.
11 games already make it a pretty long
season for the kids.

when the Colorado game became
available, the Commission approved it.
Next year's 11 th game with Missouri
had been approved in January.
Following the game in Missouri,
Stanford will travel to West Point to
meet the Army on September 18th.
Other non-league games next season
will be against Duke and San Jose
State, both at Stanford.
In 1972, Stanford could add a 12th
game, since their present 11 th game,
against Hawaii on December 2nd does
not count as an 11 th game under the
NCAA rules. But Young still does not
think an extra game will be added,
unless "something unusual comes up.
11 games already make it a pretty long
season for the kids.

BIG MOUTH—Daily Humor Freak Jon Dedmon finally stops the constant stream
of insanity earning out of his mouth by stuffing an obscene banana meringue pie
into it. A constant patron of the local House of Pits, Dedmon is especially fond of
the crust. "They must have picked up some tips from all the John Doughs running
around," he mumbled restrainedlv.
Stanford will meet Penn State in the
11 th game on their football schedule
for four straight years starting in 1 973.
The first game will be played on
September 15, 1973 in Stanford
Stadiu m.
The next three years, Stanford will
open their season against the Nittany
Lions in University Park, Pennsylvania.
Originally Stanford had tried to get two
home and home sets, but previous
scheduling made this impossible.
According to Assistant Athletic
Director, Robert Young, "We were
unable to set up a home and home set
in '75 and '76, because Penn State had
some problems with the number of
home games back in Pennsylvania.
"We think traditionally that we can
do better away from home that early in
the season, since most students haven't
returned to the campus yet. We haven't
signed the contracts yet, but all the
games have been set up by a letter of
agreement."
Traditionally, one of the strongest
Independents in the country, Penn
State had won 23 straight games before
Colorado beat them 41-13 on October
5, 19 70. Penn State lost two other

games, but still finished 18 th in the
nation with a 7-3 record.
In 1 977, Stanford will meet the
same Colorado team that broke Penn
State's win streak on September 10 in
Boulder, Colorado. Colorado is one of
the stronger teams in the tough Big
Eight conference.
The athletic department had
originally received permission from the
Student-Faculty Athletic Commission
to schedule only through 1 976, but
when the Colorado game became
available, the Commission approved it.
Next year's 11 th game with Missouri
had been approved in January.
Following the game in Missouri,
Stanford will travel to West Point to
meet the Army on September 18th.
