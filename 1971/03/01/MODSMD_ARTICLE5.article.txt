# Plastic Pie Palace Pushes Pastries
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
The three stooges and jokes about buffalo have
only one thing in common. They both rely on pies
for their humor. For those people who don't think
wiping pies out of their eyes or off their shoes is
funny, there are other ways to get some humor out of
pie. Like going to the House of Pies for example.
As All-American as greasy hamburgers and neon
lights, the HOP in Palo Alto is one of 60
extraordinarily obnoxious House of Pies on the West
Coast.
The zenith of bad taste, these plastic fantastic
havens of artificiality destroy the image of a spry
little grandmother working over her friendly mound
of dough to mold a perfect cherry pie for her family.
House of Pies cherry pies are prefabricated on an
assemblyline in Los Angeles by the thousands and
then shipped by truck to the back door of the HOP
where they sit stacked up like used tires.
Still, the HOP isn't withoul its own quaintness.
Putting in the pie-winning performance as Palo Alto's
own Little Jack Horner is HOP night manager Peter
Rried. Decked out in a snazzy banana cream-colored
blazer Peter Pie's success story with the HOP would
warm the heart of .J.C. Penny.
Sweet Talk
"I saw the building going up last summer," Mr. Pie
said in a limon meringue voice. "1 said the right things

to the right people and here I am as manager. I
wouldn't trade it for anything."
The reason Peter Bried digs working at the House
of Pies so much is because of what he calls "Pie
Freaks." While the most famous PF's are fliers, the
freaks can be of any profession, age, or mentality as
long as they are caught up in a masochistic desire to
gobble up pie in the blinding glare of the Pink 'n
Orange walls at the HOP.
"When I walk in here, all of this looks like its just
getting ready to explode," freak Steve said over his
french black bottom, "but the pie is great."
Sexist Steve
It turned out that the pies Steve really liked
weren't lit up on the big pie board but instead were
dressed up in waitress uniforms. Serving up 225 pies
per day (or 1350 individual pieces) House of Pies
waitresses are notorious for their ability to pick up
forks that are accidentally dropped on the floor next
to booths.
"These girls are realy busy little beavers," one old
man said, drooling into his berry pie. The
waitresses face a dilemma when deciding which tables
to service. "I can serve up the Dull City people and
get big tips," said one waitress "or I can do the
freaks' tables and meet some real far out dudes."
The clash between the Dull City traights and

those-who-are-not-straight (abbreviated TWANS)
provides the local color at the House of Pies. When
they are not swimming around rescuing ugly
ducklings, the TWANS slough down in their booths
watching the straights come in for pie.
"They come in here looking for a good time
among the plastic," one longhair explained, "They
think this place is cute. Its a perfect place for plastic
people to find plastic paradise."
Pot Pie
The Plastic People get their kicks too, by watching
the Twans. "I've got this one old lady who is sure she
smells marijuana every time she comes in here," Peter
Pic chuckled over his grasshopper pie, "but I just
convince her that its petulia oil."
At 2 :00 a.m. the House of Pies dims its lights
slightly and the leftover pie is tossed into a big
Demster Dumpmaster out back. The TWANS and the
straights straggle out and the HOP sits like an electric
skeleton without its organs.
Peter Bried is the last one to leave the HOP. and
more than likely, as he checks the doors and clears
the crumbs off the counters, he mellows out over the
immortal words of K.B. White who prophesi/ed all
too accurately when he said, "The future seems to me
no unified dream but a mince pie, long in the baking,
but never quite done."
