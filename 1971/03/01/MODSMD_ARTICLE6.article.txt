# beyond franklin's case
## University's Social Contract 
### 
I agree with Professor (fraud's comment that the
dismissal of a tenured Professor is a "grave and
extraordinary event in any university," but there
my agreement with him ceases, flis column clouds
the issues and, with a rhetoric of its own, contuses
can't with substance.
It seems that espousal of ideas with which he
agrees is moral leadership to Professor Giraud, but I
do not know whether he would regard the
propounding of values he does not share as immoral
or simply not leadership. His certainty about
Administration motives and his sympathy with their
objectives leave me confused, especially in the
context of his eulogy of the persecuted.
But let us turn to the central issues. I do not
intend to prejudge the case; I confine myself to the
issues in Professor Giraud's column. If the proposed
dismissal of Professor Franklin rested upon his
unpopular political views or his "embarassment to
Stanford's leadership," there would be virtual
unanimity among the faculty in defense of Professor
Franklin. But to regard the allegations against
Professor Franklin as simply involving his expression
of unpopular and frightening political views is to so
expand the concept of "political views" as to make
it meaningless. There is much more at stake in this
difficult case than the espousal of views which
"seem to favor revolution" or the administration's
"desires for public confidence."
Respect to Views
I need not remind the chairman of the
Department of French and Italian of Rousseau's
Social Contract, but perhaps I can suggest is
applicability to the present situation. The
University, like any other social institution, rests on
an underlying social contract, some of which is
implicit and some of which is quite explicit. It is
that social contract which is at stake in this case.
The concept of academic freedom in the pursuit of
truth does not mean truth as either Professor Giraud
or I define truth. The social contract in the
University requires that I give due respect to
Professor Giraud's definitions and he give due
respect to mine.

In the absence of such a contract, to allow him
to shout me down or prevent my research because
he disagrees with my view of truth would require
allowing me to shut him down. This would be
untenable; hence I claim that the social contract
requires that if I desire a hearing for my views, I
must accord similar rights to those with whom I
disagree. A contract for free inquiry is not a
guarantee only to those who share similar moral
value. It does not give me the right to prevent any
inquiries that I consider immoral for surely there are
others with differing conceptions of morality. The
contract allows me to argue, to influence or to
persuade but not to prevent. The freedom to pursue
truth through scholarship cannot be contingently
given nor conditionally withheld because of political
disputes. To engage in closing down someone's
facility for the pursuit of his truth and his
scholarship is to attack the fundamental values of a
university.
How far is the University obligated to continue
to employ someone who violates this social
contract? Does academic freedom and tenure allow
an individual to deny the rights of those whom he
personally regards as immoral? Would not the
shutting down of the University deny many of us
our rights to speak, to hear, to study, to compute
and to pursue truth in our own lights? Is the
successful shutting down of Stanford the only
action that is punishable?
Freedom to Pursue Truth
Let us be clear. The issue is not the war, or
war-related research, or revolutionary advocacy. The
issue is the requirement that one grant the same
freedom to pursue truth for others as one desires for
himself. Without such a social contract, there
cannot be a University.
The allegations in this case raise these
fundamental questions. We can only hope that the
adjudication of the case will be judicious, will
maximize due process for the individual concerned,
and will represent a reaffirmation of the
fundamental values of the University.
