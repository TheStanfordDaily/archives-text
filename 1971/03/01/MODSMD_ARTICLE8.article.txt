deke house
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am quite disturbed with your
recent article about our moving
into Mayfield House next year
because it contains a glaring slight
on our alleged activities. The
claim that "Mayfield residents
know the Dekes principally as the
people who have on several
occasions set fire to a sign put up
in front of the Columbae
(non-violent) House" may be true
- that may be their impression,
but it is unfounded. That
Mayfield residents may have
prejudged all or any Dekes as
mindless hell-raisers is a tragedy.
In my opinion the men in
Mayfield should drop by and try
to find out what the fellows in
this house are like, rather than
forming hasty impressions and
attempting to adversely affect this
Spring's Rush. I will be more than
happy to visit with any
open-minded person about the
group of men that I am part of,
and I am sure that my brothers
feel the same way. I encourage
any Mayfield residents to come to
our Rush functions.

poor tmu service
Editor, THE DAILY:
The TMU food employees were
fired because of bad

administrative decisions several
years ago! The bad decisions have
been followed by no more
intelligent decision-making since
1960-1961.
My reasoning follows:
1. The TMU food employees
were fired because the TMU food
service loses money. I assume that
if TMU food service made money,
the workers would not be fired.
2. The TMU food service loses
money because of two major
factors: poor food and poor
service, (a) Poor food—the quality
of TMU food is not vf>ry good by
my judgment and that of many
other people. Cooks should
improve quality, increase quantity
and try new ways of preparing
food or else new cooks should be
hired. A survey of customers and
potential customers to find out
what they would like to eat might
lead to better food.
(b) Poor Service—this is the
crux of the matter. When TMU
was planned around 1960 the
adminstrators decided to have
inadequate facilities. They said
"Since Stanford is a residence
university, there is no need for a
complete cafeteria service at our
new union." They obviously
ignored the non-resident graduate
students, staff, faculty, and
visitors and their need for lunch
facilities. Since then, there has not
been much improvement in the
services of TMU food service and
many people refuse to wait 15-20
minutes to get food, hence eat
elsewhere.
Some questions we might ask.
Have the administrators who
made that decision about cafeteria
service suffered from their poor
work? Do we know why the poor
decision was made and have we
changed so that similar errors will
not be made again? I suspect that
the administrators never really
researched the potential patronage
of an adequate food service.
I suggest that this is a case of
action without research leading to
bad results — the firing of
innocent food service people.
Here we have a complementary
situation to that against which our
radical friends warn us—the error
of research without action. I think
we need both research and action.

tmu rescue plan
Editor, THE DAILY:
We have been witnesses of
employees' concern about the

possibility of being fired. The
administrators explained very
dandidly that, due to tight
money, Stanford had to reduce its
commitment: this means, in the
mind of the administration, to fire
workers.
The employees, with their
logic, claimed that if the president
was to reduce his own salary by a
reasonable margin, it will allow
half a dozen of them to remain
employed at Stanford. All these
considerations reminded me of a
classical pattern of labor conflict
in an industry where everybody is
guided by self-interest.
But, everybody seems to forget
that Stanford is not a business, its
main role is not to maximize the
profit of any group. It is a
community of learning where
each of us have an important
place, though it may be different.
For that reason, we should look
for a solution within the
community with external
financial support when available,
but not in rejecting certain
members that the administrators
consider less valuable. We surely
should not go in the other
extreme which consists of
demanding that only the
administrators pay for it;
everybody, as member of the
community shall participate to its
salvation within the power of its
resources.
Everybody (student, faculty,
worker, administrator) shall
accept a cut-back in his Stanford
revenue, proportionate to its
value. As an example, for each
$100 of earnings, the percentage
value of the cut-back increases by
.01 percent.
Income Percent Cut-back Net Income
2,000 .2 4 1966
3,000 .3 9 2991
5,000 .5 25 2975
10,000 1. 100 9900
15,000 1.5 225 14,775
20,000 2. 400 19,6000
30,000 3. 900 29,100
50,000 5. 2500 47,500
A cut-back of 25 00 might look
out of proportion compared with
the others, but when we take into
consideration the part taken by
the Internal revenue at the level of
income, the loss of real income is
closer to $1000. This will provide
a gesture of solidarity among the
Stanford community that has
been missing so much recently,
and also it will be an incentive for
more careful spending by its
members.
This type of cut-back shall be
enforced till Stanford's financial
status is reestablished. Moreover,
no increase of salary shall be
granted till the entire amount of
money so cut back be reimbursed
to all the people participating.

humanism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Any set that calls itself a
"Political Action Group" and
proceeds to lecture a University
on what it ought to be has begun
by discrediting itself. The
statement "The contract between
the university and its parent
society is a political contract"
compounds the disqualification.
The bond between the institution
of higher learning and the others
is a much deeper one than that, a
generally human one. As Sidney
Hook observes, our gifts are not
for action, including political or
practical (skills or various sorts),
but rather for thinking and
imaginative contemplation and
teaching. To the extent that we
betray these rare gifts and waste

our energies in activities that can
be performed better by very many
other people, we are letting the
society, or life generally, down.
One can agree that there are
threats to this position in
excessive accomodation with the
government or any other group' a
prominent example is precisely a
"political action group." And two
wrongs don't make a right. To be
ruthlessly frank, there has been
very little pressure on our true
purposes coming from
conservative sources recently,
whereas scarcely a day passes
without some radical threat to
"shut it down." Then, those of us
who consider ourselves moderates,
or even moderate liberals, are
labelled as reactionaries if we
identify a concrete threat as such,
wherever it comes from.
We ought to purify our
purposes by strengthening the
humanities here, giving them a
central role. The humanists know
better than the scientists that true
knowledge is "regressive as well as
progressive" (Sartre), that life is a
whole, best understood by art. A
solid humanism would offset the
silly notion of the Political Action
Group that one can bull his way
into the profoundly new.

nlf atrocities
Editor, THE DAILY:
The February 19 th issue of the
Daily contained a column by the
Newman Center clergy that
condemned the leaders of this
country for not stopping "this
immoral war."
During the 1968 Tet Offensive
the North Vietnamese army
occupied Hue, South Vietnam for
approximately one month. The
population of Hue at that time
was estimated to be 1 56 ,500 and
the population of South Vietnam
was nearly 17,000,000. During
the month's occupation
approximately 4,700 citizens or 3
percent of the population of Hue
were systematically murdered by
the North Vietnamese or their
Vietcong associates (the clergy
formed a prime class for
extermination). If this is taken as
a reliable index of Communist
performance and is used to
project for all of South Vietnam,
we could expect the slaughter of
one-half million individuals if the
Communists succeed in taking
over South Vietnam.
The Newman clergy and
multitudes of others on this
campus with "moral outrage" call
for our country to immediately
end the killing and stop the war,
but they (including Dean Napier)
strangely ignore the moral
implications of the ghastly
blood-bath that very likely might
occur if the U.S. makes a too
precipitous withdrawal from
South East Asia. Perhaps some of
the campus armchair strategists
have a one-sided moral standard.
