# Petitions Oppose Court Injunction
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Intervening petitions, opposing the
University's request for a preliminary
injunction, were presented yesterday
by 55 faculty members, Trustee Denis
Hayes, and the United Stanford
Employees.
Superior Court Judge Richard W.
Rhodes took the three petitions "under
advisement" and postponed hearings on
the injunction until 10:00 a.m. this
morning in the North County
Courthouse.
The preliminary injunction which
the University is requesting would
apply to seventeen named individuals,
all members of the radical organization
Venceremos, and anyone "aiding,
abetting," or "acting in concert" with
them.
The injunction would continue the
ban on "disruptions" in the current
temporary restraining order.
Prohibited "disruptions" include
trashing, obstructing building
entrances, obstructing normal
university functions, and sit-ins after
buildings are officially closed.
The injunction would also include
new provisions banning certain
non-students from campus, including
suspended English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin. That plan drew the most fire
in today's petitions.
Injunction Vague
The faculty petition, signed by 46
professors and supported generally by 9
others, charged that portions of the
proposed injunction are "vague or
overbroad, threaten our constitutional

protections, will have intimidating
consequences, and are not condusive to
an atmosphere in which teaching and
scholarship can flourish."
Trustee Denis Hayes said he "had
not at any time been consulted about
the desirability" of the injunction, even
though it is officially in the name of
the Trustees.
Hayes, 26, is a former ASSU
President and the youngest Stanford
Trustee.
His petition said the injunction
would "stifle critical inquiry and the
free demonstration of opinion on
campus at a point in time when society
is in most serious need of a
conscience."
In its intervention complaint, the
United Stanford Employees (USE) said
the injunction would hinder its
legitimate labor activities on campus
because some of its members belong to
Venceremos and the two groups have
"co-sponsored labor activities."
Judge's Discretion
It is not clear what privileges the
petitioners will receive if intervention is
granted. Law Professor William Baxter
said, "A great deal is left in the
discretion of the judge."
Normally, intervention allows
submission of briefs and participation
in oral arguments at the conclusion of
the case, according to Baxter.
While Judge Rhodes talked with
lawyers in his chambers concerning the
petitions, over 100 spectators waited in
the crowded courtroom until the
hearing postponement was announced.

At one point, the court chambers
were cleared for thirty minutes because
of a telephoned bomb threat.
Prominent professors signing the
faculty petition included: Raymond
Giraud, Erench and Italian Department
Chairman; Charles Drekmeier, political
science; Noble Laureate Linus Pauling,
chemistry; Hubert Marshall, political
science, St. Clair Drake, anthropology
and sociology.
Also signing were Edwin Parker,
communications; Albert Guerard,
English; Pierre Noyes, SLAC; and John
Gurley, economics.
Freedom For Guests
The group asked that any injunction
not prevent teachers or others involved
in "organized educational activity" at
Stanford from inviting whomever they
wish to enter campus and classrooms
for any reasons connected with their
"teaching plans and goals."
They also said an injunction should
grant "freedom in inviting any person
or persons to homes on Stanford
property."
Prof. Drekmeier said the faculty
request stressed classroom activities and
faculty housing to establish the
professors' own legal interest in the
case.
The faculty also opposed the
"blanket banishment" of Venceremos.
USE lawyer James Wolpman later said
University lawyers now seem willing to
"back down" on including Venceremos
as an entire organization, at least until
they gather more evidence concerning
it.

The professors said, "We do not
speak in defense of disorder or rock
throwing; we speak to point out that
disorders on the campuses of this
country are linked to disorders
throughout the world in which our
federal government has participated
and to which university research has
also contributed."
They said an injunction may
actually "serve to hinder anlaysis and
correction of problems" underlying
campus unrest.
This will happen, they contended, if
an injunction "cancels the bargaining
position of one group" and relieves the
University "of an incentive to face
issues."
The professors said Bruce Franklin,
who now faces dismissal proceedings,
"has spoken out loudly and clearly on
important issues."
They added, "The memories of
some of us are sufficiently ripe to recall
the refusal of German professors to
speak out in the '30's."
Associate Provost Robert
Rosenzweig issued a statement
describing the faculty petition as
couched "in abstractions" and seeming
to "float in the air some distance away
from the real world."
He said the injunction would cover
only acts of violence and disruption,
not "political advocacy, picketing,
boycott, or other forms of peaceful,
non-coersive protest, much less
classroom teaching."

AGAINST THE INJUNCTIONâ€”Denis Hayes, former student body president
and current trustee of Stanford, is one of the signers of a petition opposing the
University's attempt to obtain a preliminary injunction.
"The result will be to protect the
open clash of ideas, the only battle
which is properly fought within the
University."
Denis Hayes flew here from
Washington, D.C., just to present his
petition. Its wording was similar to the
one filed by the professors.
Hayes said, "My contention ... is
that the merits of an injunction as an
instrument of campus law are far
outweighed by its faults.
"What profit it a university if it
saves its windows and loses its soul?"
Hayes asked.
