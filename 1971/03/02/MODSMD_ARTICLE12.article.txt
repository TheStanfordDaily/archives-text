# Council Defeats Peace Proposal
## 
### KAY GUSTAFSON 
Should the voters be allowed to
express their opinion on the war in
Vietnam in a direct vote? The Palo Alto
City Council decided that they should
not last night at their regular meeting
attended by 3 00 spectators.
Kirke W. Comstock proposed the
motion that the following question be
placed on the April ballot for the Palo
Alto voters: "We the people of Palo
Alto in unison with 73 percent of
people in a recent poll for a complete
withdrawal from South East Asia by
December 31, 1971. And we ask that
our president take appropriate action
to accomplish this goal."
Vice Mayor Frank Gallagher
proposed an amenement to this in the
form of an addition recommending that

"similarly we urge the government of
Hanoi to withdraw all foreign military
forces by December 31, 19 71 ."
A surprising amount of the
discussion centered around the topic of
whether or not the U.S. should be in
South East Asia rather than the topic
of putting the motion on the election
ballot.
Rationales ranged from "war is a
bummer" to "wanting to be able to
face the young, giving them this proof
of a democratic response to a
disagreeable national policy," from the
"audicity, townspeople feeling more
knowledgeable than the national
government" to "it's not a local matter.
After an hour and forty-five minutes
of discussion, a disturbance broke out
in the back of the room. Apparently, it
started when a fourteen year-old girl

was dragged from the room by police.
No explanation was given. It disrupted
the meeting for half-an-hour.
The meeting was barely back in
ord r, r when a cry came again from the
back of the room, stating that a
thirteen-year-old girl had been arrested
for assault in connection with the
original incident. This time, however,
dissenters were quickly quieted when
Mayor Wheatley threatened to adjourn
the meeting if the commotion
continued, thus blocking any action at
all on the motion.
The room remained silent for the
remainder of the meeting. However, the
motion was voted down, with as
without the amendment. The three
voting in favor of it were G. Clark
Spaeth, Enid Pearson, and Kirke W.
Comstock.
