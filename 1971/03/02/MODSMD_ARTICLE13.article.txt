# Draft Board Blockade Continues
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Kight persons including Associate
Dean of Students Bill Leland and
Professor Robert McAfee Brown
continued the non-violent blockade of
the San Mateo Draft Board yesterday in
protest of the United States
involvement in Indochina.
The protestors turned back between
45 and 50 people who sought entrance
10 the building, but late in the day were
overpowered by a father and his draft
age son, who broke through the
arm-locked barrier. Although Professor
Brown described certain moments as

"pretty hairy", he added that the late
afternoon pushing and shoving "didn't
get out of hand."
This is the second day in less than a
week, the anti-war contingent has
attempted to close down the draft
board. Yesterday, as before, the
demonstrators expressed their
willingness, and even desire to be
arrested.
But the police were undaunted by
the protest, and despite rumors that a
number of complaints had been
registered by those denied entrance to
the building, the only legal intervention
occurred when a motorcycle patrolman
chalked the tires of several cars that
were parked in front of the draft board.
The demonstrators sharply criticized
the law enforcement officials for
employing a double standard of justice.
At 4:30 p.m., Professor Brown issued a
statement which noted that "in the
past groups of students or blacks have
always been quickly arrested for acts
similar to ours, and we must continue
our presence here to discover to what
degree a double standard of justice
operates in our country."
Leland, who held that his role in the
demonstration was not inconsistent
with his job as Associate Dean of
Students, "because individual positions
should be taken," charged that the
"judicial system in this country
reinforces the political status quo."
Among the other demonstrators
who linked arms in front of the

building were Professor Brown's son
Peter, a Stanford graduate; Robert H.
Moulton, Jr., the Associate Director of
Administrative Services at SLAC and
his son Mark, a junior at Stanford;
Robert M. Herhold, a Lutheran Pastor
from Mountain View; John L. Kelley,
former chairman of the Department of
Mathematics at Berkeley; and Louis H.
Riley, an Associate Minister at the First
Congregational Church in Palo Alto.
Later in the day, the group was
joined by assistant professor of
sociology, Francesca Caneian, and Mrs.
Martha Weber, the mother of a draft
age son from San Mateo.
The group will continue protesting
today beginning at 10 :00 a.m.
