# USE To Fight Proposed Layoffs
## 
### PHIL LIND 
The jobs of between 16 and 20
employees of the Physical Plant will be
terminated by April 15 of this year.
The reduction was announced by
Eldridge Bacon, Jr., director of the
plant and is a result of the financial
difficulty the entire University seems to
be in at ihis time.
No individual has as yet been named
as an employee whose job will be
terminated and a committee has been
appointed by Bacon to "recommend to
the director which positions and
employees will be affected."
The committee is composed of two
permanent members, R.B. Kavinoky,
chairman and an Engineering
Superintendent at the Physical Plant;
and W.A. Wallace, recorder. The
remainder of the committee will be
made up of those supervisory personnel
of the department under concern at a
particular time.
According to the press release issued
by Bacon "The committee is charged to
complete its work and report by the
end of March. After further review,
together with the approval of the
Business Manager and the Director of
Personnel and Employee Relations,
written notice will be given to those
affected by April 1 5 ."
The committee has been meeting
now for a week primarily preparing a
list of the jobs and skills that must be
evaluated before any decisions can be
reached. "What we've done so far is just
prepare a rough draft of the skills
which will be used as a technical
reference list for the evaluation of the
individual," stated Kavinoky.
Workers Not Consulted
The individuals under consideration
will not be involved in any of the
meetings the committee has. According
to Kavinoky "The workers at the
Physical Plant may consult the
committee as to the general criteria

used to determine the necessity or lack
of it for a particular area of work, but
the committee's job is not to consult
workers in the cases of individuals
under consideration. Workers whose
jobs will be terminated have a grievance
procedure to protect them. In any
personnel matter the employee has the
right, to discuss the decision with the
supervisor involved."
John Keilch, the Main Library
worker whose job situations. The
administration sits and intellectually
decides why a particular worker should
have his livlihood stolen from him. The
grievance committee is nothing more
than words. For most workers it is not
even in reach."
According to Robert M. Nelson,
director of Personnel and Employee

Relations, the cutback in the workforce
is not a major one. "Including faculty,
administrators, and employees about
7800 people work on the Stanford
Campus. Though it is difficult for the
individuals concerned, over-all 12
workers at one place, 16 at another,
and a few elsewhere is really indicative
only of readjustment and not a major
overhaul."
Layoffs Major Issue
However, according to Jim Berk,
president of United Stanford
Employees (USE) the layoffs are of
major consideration. "We can't let the
layoffs go by without doing something.
If nothing is done to combat the
administration the layoffs will
continue."

Lack of funds is the cause of the cut
backs. "Changes in research grants,
tuition, government grants, and outside
alumni grants all play an important role
in the financial stability of the
University. The situation is in constant
flux and a few readjustments are
needed at this time," stated Nelson.
Centering around the 12 workers
layed off at Tresidder Union a number
of questions have been raised as to the
situation of all campus employees by
USE. According to Nelson, "The exact
number of workers to be laid off at the
Physical Plant has not yet been
determined but the number certainly
will not be anymore than 20 and quite
possibly less than 16 . As for the rest of
the university there is no way of saying
at this point whether further layoffs are
in the offing."
Jim Berk feels that the University is
not going to stop at the Physical Plant
and that "USE has a responsibility to
all campus employees to fight the
cutbacks."
No Prior Warning
Apparently USE was taken
completely by surprise at the
announcement of the layoffs at
Tresidder. According to Nelson "an
individual worker is not informed of
job termination until all those
concerned in the layoff in a particular
department are determined."
"The administration took us
completely by surprise and we had to
begin fighting from a downhill position.
At the physical plant we have a head
start and we will begin fighting as soon
as possible. In the last week the
boycott of Tresidder has been gaining
strength. We're gaining momentum and
eventually we'll beat the
Administration at its own money game.
A picket at the Physical Plant is a
definite possibility in the near future
and because of Teamster support of the
Plant, success is probably," according
to Berk.
