# Bomb Blast Damages U.S. Capitol Building

WASHINGTON (AP) - A powerful
bomb pulverized a men's room and
severely damaged adjoining rooms in
the U.S. Capitol early Monday 30
minutes after a telephone warning
complaining of the Laos invasion.
Nobody was injured.
The blast occurred under the U.S.
Senate but the chamber itself was
untouched and the Senate met as
scheduled at midmorning, although
visitors were not admitted as usual.
President Nixon, speaking in lowa,
said the bombing was intended by "the
violence people" to scare him into
staying in Washington and to force
closing of public buildings. "It won't
work," he said, urging increased
security measures.

The Senate Public Works Committee
scheduled an inquiry into the matter
for Tuesday morning.
Senators and congressmen of both
major parties described the bombing
variously as tragic, deplorable, cruel
and the act of a revolutionary or a
madman. The bomb shattered windows
in the crumbling West front but
newsmen could see no cracks. The
Senate barber shop was badly damaged.
Some inside walls were buckled and
workmen carted out load after load of
rubble.
The bomb site was on the ground
floor, one level below the Senate
chamber. Two of the damaged rooms
were private offices used by Sens. Caleb
Boggs, R-Del., and B. Everett Jordan,
D-N.C.
