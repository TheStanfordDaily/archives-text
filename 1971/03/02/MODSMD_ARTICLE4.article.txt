# Student Presidents Meet With Solons
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
A group of student body presidents,
representing 14 colleges and universities
across the country, are presently in
Washington "to convey collective and
individual perceptions of the campus"
to high government officials, according
to Adam Levin, a member of the ASSU
Council of Presidents, and one of the
organizers of the group.
"The reported apathy around the
country is really a growing malaise of
disaffection and alienation," Levin said.
"We thought it important to make this
(delegation) effective. It had to be done
now while there was peace on the
campuses.
"This (delegation) is a reaction to
the Laos invasion. The administration is
violating its role all over the place,"
Levin continued.
The group is advocating "total and
complete withdrawal for all fighting
men" from military operations in
Indochina.
Levin and Craig Fenech, student
body president at Berkeley, together
organized the delegation after
unsuccessful attempts to organize other
student body presidents through the
National Student Association and the
Association of Student Governments.
Express Student Viewpoint
Among the group's goals is the
formation of a national association of
college and University student body
presidents. They hope to express the
student viewpoint in Washington

"through the mechanism of a student
lobby and periodic conferences with
the administration."
The first of several conferences of
the planned association is scheduled for
this Spring.
A series of meetings between the
group and high government officials,
Congressmen, State Department
officials, and White House staffers have
already taken place. This afternoon the
delegation is scheduled to meet Foreign
Affairs Adviser Henry Kissinger.
A two-and-a-half hour meeting with
White House Adviser Robert Finch
received an extremely favorable
reaction from the members of the
delegation. "It was amazing,"
exclaimed Levin. "The man really
listened hard this time. I think he got
it."
Some members of the delegation
also met with former Ambassador at
Large, W. Averell Harriman, and with
North Dakota Senator and Democratic
Presidential aspirant George McGovern.
"Before I came down here ... I did
not expect anything out of the
meetings," said Dave Doering, student
body president at New York
University. "I did not expect that
people would be interested in hearing
information and getting answers.
Attitude Change
"A significant part of my attitude
changed on the basis of our discussion
with Finch. He was sincerely interested
in what we had to say. I was
overwhelmed .. ."
