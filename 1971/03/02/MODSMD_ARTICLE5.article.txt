# Tax Election Today
## Future Of Two Colleges At Issue 
### BILL EVERS TOM PAULU 
The fate of two local junior colleges
will be decided by the voters of San
Mateo County today in a tax election.
Canada College in Redwood City, and
Skyline College in San Bruno will have
to be closed next year if the proposed
increase in property taxes is not
approved. It is estimated that at least
10,000 students would be left without
a school if the increase is voted down.
Trustees of the San Mateo Junior
College District have said that the $4.6
million loss the district would sustain
from defeat of the proposal would
allow them to keep open only San
Mateo Junior College, the oldest of the
three institutions in the District.
Venceremos College of Redwood
City opposes approval of the measure
on the basis of opposition to taxation
of the people. It's position is that
corporations, not individuals, should
support colleges, because
college-educated youth become a great
asset to corporations, by strengthening

them and perpetuating the system they
exist under.
Taxpayers Action
Another group prominent in the
campaign against the increase is the
Taxpayers Action Council, headed by
writer E. Hoffman Price. Price, who
believes that government should "wage
war, coin money, dredge harbors, make
treaties, and keep its nose out of other
people's business thereafter,"
emphasizes that the Action Council is
not interested in the pros and cons of
the issue at hand. Me said the Council is
interested in cutting government
expenses, and thus taxes is the chief
concern of the Action Council. "We
don't want to shut colleges," stated
TAC secretary Vern Elder, "but we're
being crucified with taxes."
A "Vote Yes Campaign,"
chairmaned bv Congressman Pete
McClosky, emphasizes that the College
District has a good record of thrifty
operation. Wilson Riles, State
Superintendent of Education, has come
out in favor of the measure.

The election proposal calls for an
increase in property taxes from 11
cents per $100 assessed valuation and
the continuation of a current 12 cent
override. If the proposal is defeated,
the tax rate will fall to the same level it
was at before WWII.
Officials of the College District have
blamed the State for failing to pay its
fair share of th 1 cost though it is the
first district in t le state to have to close
facilities becau.-e of lack of income.
Special Programs Threatened
If the tax election fails, in addition
to the two colleges being closed, special
programs such as summer school, night
school, and a Student Development
Program for minority students will have
to be greatly curtailed.
The supporters of the tax increase
point out that it would in the long run
save the taxpayers money by training
people, and thus providing jobs to keep
them off welfare rolls.
Polls in San Mateo County will be
open until 8 p.m. tonight.
