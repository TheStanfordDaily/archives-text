# Excerpts From Faculty, Trustee Hayes' Statements
## 
### 
55 Faculty
We, the undersigned Stanford
faculty, wish to argue in this
intervention that portions ol the
proposed injunction, couched in
terms vague or overbroad,
threaten our constitutional
protections, will have intimidating
consequences, and are not
conducive to an atmosphere in
which teaching and scholarship
can flourish.
We worry that a case pending
which involves tenure protections
will be affected by the provision
that only with the consent ot the
prosecution in that case
(specifically President Lyman)

may the faculty member enter the
campus to gather evidence or to
confer with our attorneys; the
injunction will also have the effect
of barring certain witnesses. We
are concerned that other
institutions of higher learning
which have looked to Stanford as
an exemplar of tenure and other
protections may find their
guarantees of academic freedom
weakened by this action taken by
some of the Stanford Trustees. It
is important that we speak now to
assure the court that the Trustees,
in this action, do not speak for
the entire Stanford community.
An injunction has no effect on
the underlying causes of campus

unrest. If anything, it may serve
to hinder analysis and correction
of problems. It would be
ingenuous to see the injunction as
preserving the status quo for it in
fact cancels the bargaining
position of one group - and, to
this degree, the University is
relieved of an incentive to face
issues that are crucial to the
reputation of Stanford.
The affidavit pertaining to at
least one of the named parties
gives the impression that she is
being punished for her work in
bringing to light Stanford projects
related to the conduct of the war.
It is curious that no public
notification was given when an

S.R.I. project, carrying a
low-grade classification and for
this reason a major target of
activists, was withdrawn from the
Computer Center several days
before its occupation - especially
since it was well known that this
use of University facilities was
widely criticized (and not only by
those who have become convinced
that only direct action gets
results).
It is important that there be no
question about what is being
punished. Unfortunately an
injunction is a problematic form
of legal action. Its use accelerates
a trend toward increasing
governmental powers in private
organizations; certain legal
guarantees become inapplicable.
The injunction can be enforced
selectively, and its enforcement
rests with the university
administration. And the court
"may find itself issuing an
injunction which returns the
campus to an appearance of
normalcy but acts as a
perpetuation and enforcement of
the policies of an unresponsive
administration."
Wherefore we ask the court to
limit the scope of any injunctive
order herein so as to not limit in
any way the right of the
intervening parties to teach or

conduct their classrooms in any
manner whatsoever, and in
particular not to preclude or
interfere with any teacher or any
person involved in any organized
educational activity at Stanford
University from inviting any
person whatsoever to enter the
campus or classrooms of Stanford
for any purpose or reason
connected with the teaching plan
and goals of any of the
intervening parties, or from
enjoying complete freedom in
inviting any person or persons to
the homes of any person living on
Stanford property.

faculty, wish to argue in this
intervention that portions ol the
proposed injunction, couched in
terms vague or overbroad,
threaten our constitutional
protections, will have intimidating
consequences, and are not
conducive to an atmosphere in
which teaching and scholarship
can flourish.
We worry that a case pending
which involves tenure protections
will be affected by the provision
that only with the consent ot the
prosecution in that case
(specifically President Lyman)

may the faculty member enter the
campus to gather evidence or to
confer with our attorneys; the
injunction will also have the effect
of barring certain witnesses. We
are concerned that other
institutions of higher learning
which have looked to Stanford as
an exemplar of tenure and other
protections may find their
guarantees of academic freedom
weakened by this action taken by
some of the Stanford Trustees. It
is important that we speak now to
assure the court that the Trustees,
in this action, do not speak for
the entire Stanford community.
An injunction has no effect on
the underlying causes of campus

unrest. If anything, it may serve
to hinder analysis and correction
of problems. It would be
ingenuous to see the injunction as
preserving the status quo for it in
fact cancels the bargaining
position of one group - and, to
this degree, the University is
relieved of an incentive to face
issues that are crucial to the
reputation of Stanford.
The affidavit pertaining to at
least one of the named parties
gives the impression that she is
being punished for her work in
bringing to light Stanford projects
related to the conduct of the war.
It is curious that no public
notification was given when an

S.R.I. project, carrying a
low-grade classification and for
this reason a major target of
activists, was withdrawn from the
Computer Center several days
before its occupation - especially
since it was well known that this
use of University facilities was
widely criticized (and not only by
those who have become convinced
that only direct action gets
results).
It is important that there be no
question about what is being
punished. Unfortunately an
injunction is a problematic form
of legal action. Its use accelerates
a trend toward increasing
governmental powers in private
organizations; certain legal
guarantees become inapplicable.
The injunction can be enforced
selectively, and its enforcement
rests with the university
administration. And the court
"may find itself issuing an
injunction which returns the
campus to an appearance of
normalcy but acts as a
perpetuation and enforcement of
the policies of an unresponsive
administration."
Wherefore we ask the court to
limit the scope of any injunctive
order herein so as to not limit in
any way the right of the
intervening parties to teach or

conduct their classrooms in any
manner whatsoever, and in
particular not to preclude or
interfere with any teacher or any
person involved in any organized
educational activity at Stanford
University from inviting any
person whatsoever to enter the
campus or classrooms of Stanford
for any purpose or reason
connected with the teaching plan
and goals of any of the
intervening parties, or from
enjoying complete freedom in
inviting any person or persons to
the homes of any person living on
Stanford property.
