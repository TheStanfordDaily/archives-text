# University Replies To Writs
## 
### 
The petition of fifty-five faculty members to
intervene in the current injunction proceedings does
not challenge the facts upon which the University is
seeking the injunction. It argues, instead, that
injunctions are by nature dangerous, and it makes a
number of other points about education and about
modern and ancient history.
Perhaps because it does not deal with the facts,
but is couched very largely in abstractions, the
petition seems to float in the air some distance away
from the real world. It will help to be specific: The
events which moved the University to seek this
injunction were not political advocacy, picketing,
boycott, or other forms of peaceful, non-coercive
protest much less classroom teaching.
Nor is the injunction directed against acts of that
kind. The acts that are to be enjoined are
specifically enumerated in the order. They include,
for example, intentionally throwing rocks, boarding
up, painting, bricking, burning, smashing, trashing,
sitting or milling in, intentionally disruption or
obstructing, and so forth. The acts that are to be
enjoined are precisely those that, in the words of
the petition "are not conducive to an atmosphere in
which teaching and scholarship can flourish." No
teaching or scholarship flourished at the
Computation Center on February 1 0.
I am especially intrigued by the proposition that
the injunction "in fact cancels the bargaining
position of one group." "Bargaining" is a term most
commonly associated with labor-management

negotiations, commercial transactions, or
diplomacy. None of those are at issue here. I would
not have thought "bargaining" to be an apt
metaphor in a document from a group of faculty
that purports to speak from and to aim toward free
and open inquiry and that asks, among other things,
the right "to teach and conduct . . . classrooms in
any manner whatsoever."
Indeed, bargaining — trading one value for
another, calculating comparative strengths — would
seem to be strikingly at odds with the purposes
which the University stands to promote. The only
groups whose "bargaining position" would be
affected are those that would commit violent acts or
practice physical coercion or intimidation against
others. A "bargaining position" that rests on such
tactics deserves no protection in a university.
Of course injunctions can be dangerous weapons;
of course they can be abused; of course they have
been used improperly in the past. None of those
generalizations says anything important or uselul
about the specific action now before the court.
If the University does not make its case — and it
will properly be challenged by the defendants to do
so — then it will not deserve and should not have
the relief it seeks. If, as I believe, the case can and
will be made, the result will be to protect the open
clash of ideas, the only battle which is properly
fought within the University.

about the specific action now before the court.
If the University does not make its case — and it
will properly be challenged by the defendants to do
so — then it will not deserve and should not have
the relief it seeks. If, as I believe, the case can and
will be made, the result will be to protect the open
clash of ideas, the only battle which is properly
fought within the University.

The petition of fifty-five faculty members to
intervene in the current injunction proceedings does
not challenge the facts upon which the University is
seeking the injunction. It argues, instead, that
injunctions are by nature dangerous, and it makes a
number of other points about education and about
modern and ancient history.
Perhaps because it does not deal with the facts,
but is couched very largely in abstractions, the
petition seems to float in the air some distance away
from the real world. It will help to be specific: The
events which moved the University to seek this
injunction were not political advocacy, picketing,
boycott, or other forms of peaceful, non-coercive
protest much less classroom teaching.
Nor is the injunction directed against acts of that
kind. The acts that are to be enjoined are
specifically enumerated in the order. They include,
for example, intentionally throwing rocks, boarding
up, painting, bricking, burning, smashing, trashing,
sitting or milling in, intentionally disruption or
obstructing, and so forth. The acts that are to be
enjoined are precisely those that, in the words of
the petition "are not conducive to an atmosphere in
which teaching and scholarship can flourish." No
teaching or scholarship flourished at the
Computation Center on February 1 0.
I am especially intrigued by the proposition that
the injunction "in fact cancels the bargaining
position of one group." "Bargaining" is a term most
commonly associated with labor-management

negotiations, commercial transactions, or
diplomacy. None of those are at issue here. I would
not have thought "bargaining" to be an apt
metaphor in a document from a group of faculty
that purports to speak from and to aim toward free
and open inquiry and that asks, among other things,
the right "to teach and conduct . . . classrooms in
any manner whatsoever."
Indeed, bargaining — trading one value for
another, calculating comparative strengths — would
seem to be strikingly at odds with the purposes
which the University stands to promote. The only
groups whose "bargaining position" would be
affected are those that would commit violent acts or
practice physical coercion or intimidation against
others. A "bargaining position" that rests on such
tactics deserves no protection in a university.
Of course injunctions can be dangerous weapons;
of course they can be abused; of course they have
been used improperly in the past. None of those
generalizations says anything important or uselul
about the specific action now before the court.
If the University does not make its case — and it
will properly be challenged by the defendants to do
so — then it will not deserve and should not have
the relief it seeks. If, as I believe, the case can and
will be made, the result will be to protect the open
clash of ideas, the only battle which is properly
fought within the University.
