I am a trustee of Stanford
University. I was elected by
alumni of the university in the
spring of 1970; my membership
was formalized at the September,
19 70, meeting of the Board. The
alumni election, the first of its
kind at Stanford, was an attempt
to diversify the board, and to
make it more responsive to the
varied constituencies of the
university. Because of these
special circumstances surrounding
my membership on the Board, I
feel a special responsibility to

speak forthrightly on issues
crucial to the university.
My opposition to the
injunction stems both from the
specific terms of the document
and from the way this action fits
into an unfortunate national
patterns. I believe that portions of
the proposed injunction are
couched in terms which are
dangerously vague or overbroad.
And I believe that the various
hard-line actions being undertaken
by duly-constituted authorities
around the country, including the
infiltration of campus groups by
all manner of intelligence
personel, the cancerous growth of
unchecked data banks on
unknowing individuals, and the
repressive rhetoric issuing from
our national administration, our
state administration, and from
campus administrations alike,
constitute a far greater threat to
the integrity of the university
than do the evils they are
supposedly holding in check.
I believe that the introduction
of this injunction into Stanford
University will have intimidating
consequences far beyond its
announced goals. I fear that all
forms of protest which depart
from "business as usual" —
including forms of protest which

have in past years come to be
accepted as appropriate responses
to matters of conscience — will
now be in contempt of court.
1 regret the legal banishment of
an organization from campus —
regardless of the conditions under
which its members would be
willing to enter. As a Trustee I
believe that faculty members
should be free to invite such
speakers on campus as they desire.
I do not believe that membership
in any organization constitutes
grounds for refusal of
employment, except as the
employee is demonstrably not
performing the task for which he
was hired. And 1 certainly do not
consider it any of my business
whom resident faculty members
entertain in their homes.
My final point is perhaps most
important. Campus disorders
around the world (as the
President's Commission on
Campus Unrest aptly pointed out)
are linked to other world-wide
disorders in which the American
government has participated, and
to which university research has
also contributed. An injunction,
rather than contributing toward
the solution of any of these*
"root" problems, may well stifle
constructive efforts to analyze
and call public attention to them.
