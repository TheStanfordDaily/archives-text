Today In The 'Daily 9
Thirty-four years ago, the campus was awash with stormy
protest and indignation. The local barbers had raised the price
of haircuts of 65 cents. "Outrageous!" screamed the Daily in a
rousing editorial. "With the campus filled with women, a
haircut and shave are necessary at any price. And the barbers
know it! Good appearance has become a luxury."
A day later the firehouse became the nerve-center of a
cdmpus- wide boycott; firemen were dipping the hairy for only
35 cents. A righteous revolutionary action!

to read about it, call our news freaks at 321-2300 ext. 4632. V\/e
