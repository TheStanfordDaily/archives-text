SALES MANAGER and SALESMEN
required by
THE STANFORD DAILY
~ SALES MANAGER
The Stanford Daily requires a Sales Manager to help create and supervise a sales
force to sell display advertisements. This force has been lacking in the past, and the
Daily's revenues have suffered as a result. Now is the time for action, for a man
ager who possesses initiative, an aggressive selling spirit, and the motivation and
ability to build a sales force from virtually nothing.
The Sales Manager will be remunerated $50 per month as sales manager, plus
commissions on his own sales (20%), plus overriding commissions (2%) on those of
his salesmen.
Applications are welcome from any student who will be remaining as a Stanford
student at least through 1971 /72. It is anticipated that the Sales Manager will make
his biggest sales drives during vacations, but will also continue to sell during term
time. Preference will be given to the person showing the greatest potential; pre
vious selling experience is an extremely useful but non-essential prerequisite.
SALESMEN
For students who have less time to devote to an extra-curricular activity, oppor
tunities to earn a substantial income exist as salesmen. Enthusiasm, and not experi
ence, is the required prerequisite. It is anticipated that salesmen will be given any
necessary training and support. Any person, grad., or undergrad., is eligible.
Remuneration will be in the form of commissions at the rate of 20%, and every
encouragement will be given to help salesmen be successful. This work could be
both interesting and financially rewarding.
All applications to be made to Brian Hardy, Business Manager, ex. 4630 or 327-41 50
