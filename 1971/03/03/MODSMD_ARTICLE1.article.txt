# Stanford Student Arrests In Draft Demonstrations
## 
### FRED MANN 
Thirty people including 22 Stanford
students were arrested for blocking
entrances to draft boards and a military
induction center in anti-war
demonstrations throughout the Bay
Area yesterday.
The protesters, most of them
members of the campus non-violent
co-operative, Columbae House staged
the peaceful protests in San Francisco
(where 13 arrests were made), in
Oakland, (12 arrests), and San Jose
(five arrests).
Meanwhile, University faculty,
clergy, and community members, led
by Prof, of Religion Robert McAfee
Brown continued their similar
demonstration at the San Mateo draft
board for the third day. As in previous
protests there, police ignored the
blockade and took no action.
Fifteen University of California
students demonstrated and blocked
draft board doorways in Berkeley
yesterday. Police cleared the entrance
but made no arrests.
Different charges were lodged against
protesters in each location. Those
arrested at the Selective Service office
at 100 McAllister St., in San Francisco
face possible federal misdemeanor
charges for unlawful assembly in a
federal building. The 13, all Stanford
students, spent the night in jail, and
will be arraigned today before a federal
marshall who will determine whether or
not to press charges.
New Charges Possible
If the national government decides
not to prosecute, the state of California
and local officials have the opportunity
to establish new charges.
The Oakland arrests took place at
the Army Induction Center which
houses Local Draft Board offices
49,50,51, and 52. Those taken into
custody were charged with three
misdemeanor counts: unlawful
assembly, failure to disperse, and
obstructing the sidewalk. Of the 12
arrested, nine were identified as
Stanford students.
All were held overnight on $1,25 0
bail and are scheduled to be arraigned
in Oakland Municipal Court today at
2:00 p.m.
The five arrested for obstructing the
entrance to Local Boards 60, 61, and
62 in San Jose included a doctor from
the Stanford hospital, and a physicist at
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center.
None of the five were students.
According to a jail spokesman, the
three men arrested were released on
their own recognizance late yesterday
afternoon. The two women were held
until approximately 7:00 p.m., and
then released on $125 bond each.
Leaflets And Discussion
Demonstrators started their
blockades at all the boards at 10:00
a.m. While groups of protesters stopped
traffic going into and out of the
buildings, others distributed leaflets
and discussed their actions with
passers-by.
A statement released to the press
read in part:
"We serve notice with our action
that the war in Indochina has escalated,
and that Americans must ensure that
the murder there stop immediately. At

a time when the administration claims
to be disengaging, we see the war
escalating... It is not enough for us to
merely cry out against the killing. We
must act.
"Therefore, we are nonviolently,
(that is, without hatred against
persons), blocking the entrance to the
draft board, the most direct link
between America's civilians and its
military. We urge others to continue
and enlarge upon these actions.
"We do not consider our acts illegal,
but rather, we are attempting to fulfill
our responsibilities as human beings in
accordance with the Hague
Conventions, the Geneva Accords, and
the Principles of Nuremberg.
"We recognize the risks entailed in
our actions. But these are far
outweighed by the consequences of our
continued acquiescence to this illegal
and immoral war."
No Resistance
At the time of arrest at all three
sites, protesters did not resist. Many
by-standers in Oakland applauded those
arrested as they left in police custody,
and students in San Francisco sang as
they were being led off.
In San Mateo, Prof. Brown and
Associate Dean of Students Bill Leland
led blockaders and engaged in heated
arguments with those trying to enter
the draft board, one of them a former
Green Beret. Brown criticized the
"obvious double standard of justice in
this country, as evidenced by the quick

arrest of students" for their anti-war
protests.

on the grass at White Plaza today to
discuss the events of yesterday and the
philosophy behind this and any future
anti-war actions

ON THE WAGON—Anti-war protesters load into an Oakland paddy wagon yesterday after blocking entrance to the draft
board for three and one half hours. 12 were arrested. During the non-violent demonstration at least 30 people forced their
way into the board office, pushing those standing in their way. After the arrest of seven protesters, five more blocked the
back door of the building, faced hostile crowds, and were themselves arrested.
