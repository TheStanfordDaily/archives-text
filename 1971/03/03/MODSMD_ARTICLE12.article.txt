# New Flexibility
## Changes Made In Overseas Programs 
### 
The Overseas Campus Program,
hard-pressed by plunging
applications and the shift of
undergraduates' interest to other
programs, is responding with
greater flexibility.
A number of important changes
are being made in the academic
programs at the European
campuses, Mile, Henriette
Bordenave, Assistant Director of
the program, said yesterday, and
these changes affect not only the
courses offered on the campuses
themselves, but also the
pre-departure requirements. For
example, many students not
previously eligible for study
abroad—including students who
previously attended an Overseas
Campus, freshman in their third
quarter, and graduate
students—may not apply for
future sessions.
Because of the changes, the
application deadline for studying
overseas during the 1971-72
academic year has been extended
through March 11. There are now
places available for most campuses
even before March 1 972 ; indeed,
according to Mile. Bourdenave, in

"exceptional cases," students may
still be accepted to the Austria,
France and Italy groups leaving
next quarter.
In addition to liberalized
eligibility for study overseas, there
is a new flexibility in
pre-departure language
requirements and in the academic
work load overseas.
No More Grades
All pre-departure language and
orientation courses may now be
taken on a Pass/No Credit option
basis, rather than for a letter grade
as previously required. This,
according to Mile. Bordenave, will
make it easier for students with
stiff major requirements to fit the
courses into their schedule.
Even more importantly, the
pre-departure language
requirement has been reduced
from three courses to two courses
in the case of Austria and
Germany. For France and Italy,
the pre-departure minimum
remains three course, although the
subcommittees involved are
reexamining these requirements.
For Italy, one of the three

courses may be in a subject other
than language. For Britain, the
pre-departure requirement is three
classes chosen from a broad list of
courses relating to England.
One of the more striking
changes in the alternation taking
place in the kind of language
courses offered overseas. For
years, students at the German,
Italian, French, and Austrian
campuses have had to take six
units per quarter of language
work, largely in the traditional
mold of language study. Starting
this summer in Germany, and
next fall in Italy, both the number
of units and the kind of courses
involved are being markedly
altered. Each quarter a student
will take only four units of
required foreign language work,
and in Italy the courses are being

reorganized as conversational
colloquia, rather than traditional
grammar and language courses.
These colloquia will focus on
various subject matters and will be
conducted entirely in the language
involved. Serious attention is
being given to possible
comparable changes at the
Austrian and French campuses.
As noted, applications are being
accepted until March 11 for
Britain and Germany during the
Winter and Spring quarters
1971-72, and for Austria, France,
and Italy for the Spring and
Summer quarters of next year.
There are, however, openings in
earlier groups and those interested
are invited to inquire at any time
at the Overseas Campuses Office
in the Old Union about joining a
group that was selected earlier.

place in the kind of language
courses offered overseas. For
years, students at the German,
Italian, French, and Austrian
campuses have had to take six
units per quarter of language
work, largely in the traditional
mold of language study. Starting
this summer in Germany, and
next fall in Italy, both the number
of units and the kind of courses
involved are being markedly
altered. Each quarter a student
will take only four units of
required foreign language work,
and in Italy the courses are being

reorganized as conversational
colloquia, rather than traditional
grammar and language courses.
These colloquia will focus on
various subject matters and will be
conducted entirely in the language
involved. Serious attention is
being given to possible
comparable changes at the
Austrian and French campuses.
As noted, applications are being
accepted until March 11 for
Britain and Germany during the
Winter and Spring quarters
1971-72, and for Austria, France,
and Italy for the Spring and
Summer quarters of next year.
There are, however, openings in
earlier groups and those interested
are invited to inquire at any time
at the Overseas Campuses Office
in the Old Union about joining a
group that was selected earlier.
The Overseas Campus Program,
hard-pressed by plunging
applications and the shift of
undergraduates' interest to other
programs, is responding with
greater flexibility.
A number of important changes
are being made in the academic
programs at the European
campuses, Mile, Henriette
Bordenave, Assistant Director of
the program, said yesterday, and
these changes affect not only the
courses offered on the campuses
themselves, but also the
pre-departure requirements. For
example, many students not
previously eligible for study
abroad—including students who
previously attended an Overseas
Campus, freshman in their third
quarter, and graduate
students—may not apply for
future sessions.
Because of the changes, the
application deadline for studying
overseas during the 1971-72
academic year has been extended
through March 11. There are now
places available for most campuses
even before March 1 972 ; indeed,
according to Mile. Bourdenave, in

"exceptional cases," students may
still be accepted to the Austria,
France and Italy groups leaving
next quarter.
In addition to liberalized
eligibility for study overseas, there
is a new flexibility in
pre-departure language
requirements and in the academic
work load overseas.
No More Grades
All pre-departure language and
orientation courses may now be
taken on a Pass/No Credit option
basis, rather than for a letter grade
as previously required. This,
according to Mile. Bordenave, will
make it easier for students with
stiff major requirements to fit the
courses into their schedule.
Even more importantly, the
pre-departure language
requirement has been reduced
from three courses to two courses
in the case of Austria and
Germany. For France and Italy,
the pre-departure minimum
remains three course, although the
subcommittees involved are
reexamining these requirements.
For Italy, one of the three

courses may be in a subject other
than language. For Britain, the
pre-departure requirement is three
classes chosen from a broad list of
courses relating to England.

changes in the alternation taking
