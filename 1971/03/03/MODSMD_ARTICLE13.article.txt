"It's off to Pullman," as
wrestling coach Dave Reed says.
The Indians, who completed a 2-8
season after dropping their final
dual meet of the year to the Cal
Bears 31-12, will enter several
strong contenders for NCAA
qualification this weekend at
Washington State in the District

VIII Qualifying Tournament.
Coach Reed's highest hopes
ride on three Tribe standouts who
have led the squad all year. Senior
co-captian Dave Thomas, who
finished fourth in Pac-8 mat
action last season, is a strong
contender in the 14 2 class.
Against Cal last week, Thomas
drew 1 -1 with Pete Medley, who
finished second in the conference
in 1 9 70. At 134, Ken Krebs
wrestled "the best match of (his
collegiate career" against Cal by

pinning "a determined" Tony
Yamamoto in the second period,
according to Reed.
Chris Horpel also continued his
winning ways at 15 0 by pinning
Cal's Cesar Vasquez midway
through the first period. Horpel,
undefeated in dual meet action
this year, should be seeded high in
this weekend's district qualifier.
In other matches against Cal,
Steve Goss (158) wrestled an
exciting match, losing in the last
period on a near fall, 3-2.
