# Swimmers Travel For Pac-8 Meet
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's 1971 Varsity
swimming team travels south to
Santa Monica High School
tomorrow for the Pac-8
Championships. Host USC and
cross-town rival UCLA will
provide the Tribe with its
toughest competition.
"It looks very close at this
point. Either of the three top
teams could win it," commented
Indian tank coach, Jim Gaughran.
Stanford takes its usual
complement of strong individual
racers into action this weekend.
Brian Job and Dave Shilling

probably pose the best 1-2 punch
for the Cards. "Brian should win
both the 100 and 200 , but a
Washington swimmer has a better
time in the 200. Dave should
finish in the top three in both
events," Gaughran said.
Brent Berk and Tim Broderick
will carry the Indians' hopes in
the distance events. "We're
looking for both Berk and
Broderick to place in the finals,"
Coach Gaughran said.
In butterfly and backstroke,
Stanford boasts two top
conference swimmers in John
Ferris and Fred Haywood. "Ferris
is pretty supreme in butterfly in
this conference but he'll have a
tough race in the 100. Defending
champion, Fred Haywood, should
repeat, but all his races look
tough," Gaughran predicted.
Crucial to the Tribe's
aspirations of taking the team
crown will be Stanford's sprinters.
"I hope the sprints finally come
along. We need Martin Pedley to
pull through for us and we're
looking for good showings from
Steve Carey, Rick Eagleston, and
Ray Collins. Those guys need to
do the job they're capable of
doing if we're going to be close in
team points," Gaughran said.
Gaughran also expects strong
performances from class divers
Bill Main and Ted Nichols, and
Stanford's medley and freestyle
sprint relays.
