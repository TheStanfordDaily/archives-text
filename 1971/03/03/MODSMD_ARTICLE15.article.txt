# Jaros Nets Two
## Hockey Ties Cal 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford Club Hockey
team was tied by the Berkeley
Juniors Monday night, 5-5, in the
first round of the finals of the
Northern California Senior
Hockey League. This game was
the final preparation for the
tournament in Boulder, Colorado
in which the Stanford team will
compete later this week.
The Indians were ahead 5-2
halfway through the final period,
but Berkeley scored three quick
goals to knot the score. Each team
had good chances after that but
couldn't quite connect.
The game was marred by
several fights and many penalties.
However, the referees called a
good game and maintained
control throughout.
Rich Jaros scored twice for the
Indians while Russ Macausland,
Pat Baldwin, and Paul Tittmann
added single tallies.
The team played fairly strong
defensive hockey, except for the
lapse that permitted three goals in
the third period. Goalies Rick
Bragden and Gervin Peters made
several good saves and played
consistently well throughout the
game.
Berkeley scored first on a

screened shot from the point off a
faceoff. Stanford came back and
scored two goals. Pat Baldwin tied
the score as his shot from 20 feet
out found the far corner. Shortly
after a power play, Paul Tittmann
passed to Russ Macausland
standing alone in front. He beat
the goaltender to put Stanford
into the lead.
In the third period Stanford
traded goals with Berkeley before
Jaros and Tittmann put the Cards
ahead 5-2 on fine shots from
close-in.
The teams played tight hockey
despite many penalities. Then
with Stanford a man down,
Berkeley scored the first of three
quick goals on a scramble in front.
A shot from the point and
another screened shot earned a tie
for the Uniors.
The first game for the Indians
in the Colorado Invitational
Hockey tournament will be at
6:30 p.m. on Thursday night. The
tournament will be a round-robin
affair. Stanford plays Friday and
Saturday night and returns to
home Sunday. Along with lowa
State College, Wisconsin State
College, and host team University
of Colorado at Boulder, the Cards
will be vying for the Colorado
Cup.
