# Recycling Day Set
## 
### 
In an attempt to publicize the need
for man to recycle his waste and to
demonstrate that materials can be
recycled, the Conservation Group has
Friday "Recycling Day."
C&ns and glass containers will be collected
with the aid of two University donated
trucks, Friday from all 5 0 residences
(all except Escondido Village). Also, a
section of the Wilbur parking lot will be
set aside where other University
departments can deliver cans and glass
to be collected.
The Conservation Group will
transport the cans and glass to Ecology
Action in Palo Alto, which will deliver
them to recycling plants in the Bay
Area.

Stacey Fitzsimmons, student
coordinator of the day, hopes to prove
to the University that students will
recycle their trash and that enough
volume of materials will be collected to
encourage the University to set up
some regular recycling program.
She hopes that in the future officials
will consider doing one of the
following:
—making rounds to the living groups
once every two weeks to collect
recyclable materials;
—order all returnable glass containers
for foods;
—order all aluminum containers for
foods; or establish a tri-partite garbage
collection system to ensure that all
waste materials are recycled.
Friday, volunteers will collect cans
and bottles from 50 University
residences (fraternities and dormitories
not including Escondido Village) from
11 a.m. until 4 p.m. Newspapers will
not be collected because of the
tremendous volume and since the only
recycling plant in California is located
in Southern California.
Fitzsimmons hopes that Stanford
could lead a peninsula movement
toward recycling all waste materials.
Recycling efforts here might serve as a
precedent for other areas, she added.
Ecology Action, which will deliver
the cans and glass, is a non-profit
ecology organization staffed by
volunteers and four nominally paid
people who deliver recyclable materials
to plants. Currently they work only on
weekends collecting goods and for most
of the past year have lost money in
their endeavors.
