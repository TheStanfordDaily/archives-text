Greek Protest
About 25 persons, mostly students
wearing Venceremos buttons and
students from Greece, staged a noisy
protest inside Cubberley Hall yesterday
afternoon as the Greek Minister of
Education conferred with a School of
Education official.
The half-hour conference between
Arthur P. Coladarci, acting dean of the
School of Education, and Nikitas Sioris
went according to schedule, Coladarci
said later. But, he said, it was "pretty
loud" in the room "a quarter of the
time."
The demonstrators, who were
kicking the door leading to the
conference room and chanting "death
to all fascist pigs," were protesting
Sioris' alleged jailing and torturing
Greek students without any trials.
The demonstrators, who earlier had
demanded that the meeting be
cancelled, followed Sioris and his
escourts out of the building and
confronted him briefly as he entered
his car behind Cubberley.
The demonstrators continued to
chant and argue with the minister, who,
smiling all the time, answered in Greek
and incoherent English. As the car
drove off, Soiris leaned out the window
and lightly slapped one of the
protestors on his cheek.
