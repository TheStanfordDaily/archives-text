# Faculty Salaries Increase Despite University's Financial Pressures
## 
### 
In spite of financial pressure on the
University, faculty salaries increased
this year about five percent, the same
rate as they have in previous years.
A statement released two weeks ago
by Provost William Miller shows that
the average nine-month salary of full
professors has gone from $20,844 last
year to $21,833 this year. The average
salaries of assistant and associate
professors likewise went up by about
$1,000.
The highly detailed report, presented
for the first time last year by then
Provost Lyman, shows faculty salaries
for the past six years, broken down by
schools.
Commenting on the salary
differentials that are apparent between
the different schools, Lyman wrote
that they "show the impact of so-called
market conditions on the academic
profession... . they reflect a
nationwide situation, not a
circumstance particular to Stanford."
For example, the $5,000 difference
between the average salary for a full
professor in the Law School, as
compared with humanities and sciences
or engineering, is in part explained by
the lucrative positions available for
lawyers outside the university.
In the department of Humanities and
Sciences, however, some humanities
faculty have expressed resentment over
the $1,300 difference in their averagf
salaries compared with those of
physical and social science professors.
According to Associate Dean Peter
Foulkes, "There is no intrinsic reason
why humanists should be paid less."
Raises in individual faculty salaries,
which are often for the purpose of
keeping good professors from leaving
Stanford for another institution, were
more pronounced in favor of the
natural sciences a few years ago.
This is no longer the case, and
Foulkes is "disappointed and

disturbed" that the salary differentials
still remain, although he thinks the
humanities have started to catch up.
"I will do my utmost to remedy this
difference," he adds. "As far as possible
we should resist allowing market
conditions to affect us."
Dean Richard Jahns of Earth
Sciences, whose professors are the
lowest paid on the average for the
university, thinks that salary
differences between various
departments exist for historical reasons.
Once things are knocked out of
kilter, he says, "It's very hard to bring
things back to what looks like a proper
adjustment on paper."
In the area of faculty recruitment,
Foulkes and Jahns see no immediate
difficulties for Stanford.
Last spring the California legislature
refused to increase its appropriation for
faculty salaries in the U.C. system in a
move which many observors described
as punitive. In addition, Governor

Reagan's proposed budget for next year
does not include an increase in faculty
salaries even though the Board of
Regents has recommended a raise of
11%.
The U.C. faculty will in fact feel
about a ten percent decrease in real
income, due to the effect of two years
inflation on an unchanging salary. At
Stanford the chief motive for the salary
increase has been to work against
inflation.
The American Association of
University Professors reported last
summer that two out of every five
schools are unable to raise professor's
salaries along with the cost of living.
Payment of faculty for teaching
duties, as opposed to research activities,
takes up slightly more than one quarter
of the University's operating budget
this year. Considering the value
Stanford places on its faculty, if past
history is to be believed this portion of
the budget will continue to increase.
