SAN MATEO (AP) — Voters approved
by a wide margin yesterday a tax
increase proposal needed to keep two
junior colleges in operation.
The measure extends a 12-cent
override and approves a hike of 11 -cent
per $100 of assessed value for the San
Mateo Junior College District.

With all precints counted, the yes
vote was 86,840, no 56,451.
Matt Frassanaro, business manager of
the College of San Mateo and
coordinator of the campaign, claimed
victory on the basis of fairly early
returns when the favorable spread
appeared.
