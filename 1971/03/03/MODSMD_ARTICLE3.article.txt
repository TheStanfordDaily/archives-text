# Final Arguments
## Injunction Hearing Scheduled 
### FRANK MILLER 
Final arguments in the Superior Court hearing on
the University's request for a preliminary injunction
against sixteen named defendants are scheduled to
begin at 10 a.m. today.
In arguments before the court yesterday, Defense
Attorney Norton Tooby claimed that the injunction,
if granted, would be "extremely effective in wiping
out 95 percent of the political activities at Stanford
which should be protected." He termed the
injunction "political repression."
David Heilbron, University attorney, claimed that
the University's position is that "this kind of stuff
(violent dissent) has gone on long enough. Enough is
enough."
Noting that "this is not the first time" the
University has come before the court in dealing with
student protest, Heilbron noted that it is "a bit
nastier and rougher" now than in the past.
The Court announced that it would procede with
the hearing allowing attorneys of three petitions
Monday who present intervening groups to present
arguments against the injunction while reserving the
right to decide later on the "propriety of the
intervention." The Judge noted that he had to
conduct further study to determine if intervening
petitions were allowed in cases of this type.
The Judge did, however, rule against trustee Dennis
Hayes' opposition to the injunction on the grounds
that it was not duly authorized since he, a trustee.

had not been consulted before the injunction was
sought on behalf of the Board of Trustees.
Heilbron also notified the court that "at this time"
the University will not try to apply the temporary
injunction to Venceremos as an entity or to members
of Venceremos not specifically named in the
injunction.
If granted, the preliminary injunction would
prohibit 16 named individuals from encouraging or
participating in any "disruptions" on campus,
including: trashing, obstructing building entrances,
obstructing normal University functions, and
sitting-in after buildings are officially closed.
The injunction would also include new provisions
banning certain non-students from campus, including
Franklin (since he is currently suspended).
Suspended English professor Bruce Franklin, who
is representing himself in the hearing, claimed that his
"real crime lies in exposing the true nature of the
Board of Trustees and the Stanford empire." Franklin
continued, "The main business of Stanford is
maintaining and expanding an empire in the Pacific
Basin."
In one of his more sensational statements during
the hearing, Franklin applauded the bombing of the
United States Senate building early Monday morning.
"I would say frankly that when I read of the bombing
of the Senate yesterday, I thought that was a
wonderful act... ." he said.
He continued that any injunction will not prevent

revolutionary thoughts or statements but "when a
peaceful sit-in or advocacy of a strike is threatened as
criminal behavior, the state teaches us a lesson—that
our revolutionary analysis is correct and that at some
time we should advocate immediate armed struggle
against the state."
Heilbron outlined in his opening statement alleged
incidents of damage or incitement to damage that
have occurred in protests on campus since February
that he maintains necessitate the granting of the
injunction.
These included:
—On Feb. 7 the "trashing" of numerous windows
in several campus buildings;
—On Feb. 8 a group tried to force its way into a
Board of Trustees' committee meeting;
—On Feb. 10, the Computation Center was broken
into the shut down;
—The night of Feb. 10 Bruce Franklin told a rally
that "mass militant action would be suicidal, called
for 'peoples' war' Heilbron continued, a short time
later, several students were assaulted by attackers and
beaten with fists and with a stick.
Janet Weiss, who is defending herself, maintained
yesterday that the University has only a "patchwork"
case against her and "has failed to show that 1 have
done any criminal acts."
She claimed that the injunction is a handy way of
"roping people in" and convicting them with
evidence not sufficient criminal convictions.
