# Penal System Scored
## 
### CRAIG COTERA 
"Beginning to study the civil liberties
of prisoners is like stepping into
quicksand in which you get sucked in
and in and in," said authoress Jessica
Mitford to a group of about a hundred
in Tresidder's Large Lounge last night.
Miss Mitford achieved widespread
national noteriety after the publishing
of her book on the absurdities of
American funeral businesses in The
American Way of Death. Presently she
is collecting material for a book on
American prison systems—California in
particular.
"California is considered by many
authorities as the model state in the
country as far as penology is
concerned," continued Miss Mitford,
"and has incorporated nearly all of the
reforms fought for for decades."
The four most important reforms
Miss Mitford said California had
incorporated were: the indeterminate
sentence in which the judge looks not
so much at the crime as the character
of the prisoner," rehabilitation as
opposed to punishment, classification
of the prisoner based on their
performance in prison, and the chance
for the offender to return to the
community as soon as he is ready.
The crux of the California system is
the indeterminate sentence which takes
sentencing authority out of the hands
of the judges into the hands of a body
of experts who examine the criminal's
chances for rehabilitation," Miss
Mitford said.
Despite the existence of such a
reform procedure in California, Miss
Mitford went on to comment on the
many inequites of the system.
First of all, Miss Mitford feels that
the composition of California's parole
and sentencing boards which is
determined by Gov. Reagan is hardly
objective. She stated that all the
members of these boards are or were

police or prison officers with one
exception—a retired dentist.
"The actual result of the
indeterminate system in California has
been the highest median release date
for prisoners in the country—three
years," Miss Mitford said.
Another "reform" which Miss
Mitford examined is the new emphasis
on psychiatric care for criminals. She
cited at length the encounter of one
San Quentin inmate with the prison's
psychiatrist, who is now chief
psychiatrist for the California prison
system.
Accoiding to Miss Mitford, the
psychiatrist began the interview like
this:
"How are you feeling today?"
"Pretty good, I guess." replied the
prisoner.
"That's a pretty negative answer isn't
it?
"What's negative about it?"
"Ah Ha! So now you're asking the
questions are you?"
Miss Mitford pointed out that
neither the prisoner nor his counsel can
look at psychiatric evaluations kept in
the prisoner's "jacket," the file kept on
him throughout his imprisonment,
because "it would violate the hallowed
doctor patient relationship although
the FBI and the police are allowed to
see it."
Miss Mitford also stated she found
serious inequities in the prisoner's due
process rights while a prisoner.
A prisoner can be cited for even the
smallest infraction of prison regulations
such as excessive hair length and his
only redress is a hearing before the
prison "disciplinary committee"
usually comprised of the Warden and
other prison officials. Miss Mitford
claims this hearing "lasts on the average
no more than ten minutes, and the
prisoner is totally alone" and without
any legal safeguards whatever.

the FBI and the police are allowed to
see it."
Miss Mitford also stated she found
serious inequities in the prisoner's due
process rights while a prisoner.
A prisoner can be cited for even the
smallest infraction of prison regulations
such as excessive hair length and his
only redress is a hearing before the
prison "disciplinary committee"
usually comprised of the Warden and
other prison officials. Miss Mitford
claims this hearing "lasts on the average
no more than ten minutes, and the
prisoner is totally alone" and without
any legal safeguards whatever.
"Beginning to study the civil liberties
of prisoners is like stepping into
quicksand in which you get sucked in
and in and in," said authoress Jessica
Mitford to a group of about a hundred
in Tresidder's Large Lounge last night.
Miss Mitford achieved widespread
national noteriety after the publishing
of her book on the absurdities of
American funeral businesses in The
American Way of Death. Presently she
is collecting material for a book on
American prison systems—California in
particular.
"California is considered by many
authorities as the model state in the
country as far as penology is
concerned," continued Miss Mitford,
"and has incorporated nearly all of the
reforms fought for for decades."
The four most important reforms
Miss Mitford said California had
incorporated were: the indeterminate
sentence in which the judge looks not
so much at the crime as the character
of the prisoner," rehabilitation as
opposed to punishment, classification
of the prisoner based on their
performance in prison, and the chance
for the offender to return to the
community as soon as he is ready.
The crux of the California system is
the indeterminate sentence which takes
sentencing authority out of the hands
of the judges into the hands of a body
of experts who examine the criminal's
chances for rehabilitation," Miss
Mitford said.
Despite the existence of such a
reform procedure in California, Miss
Mitford went on to comment on the
many inequites of the system.
First of all, Miss Mitford feels that
the composition of California's parole
and sentencing boards which is
determined by Gov. Reagan is hardly
objective. She stated that all the
members of these boards are or were

police or prison officers with one
exception—a retired dentist.
"The actual result of the
indeterminate system in California has
been the highest median release date
for prisoners in the country—three
years," Miss Mitford said.
Another "reform" which Miss
Mitford examined is the new emphasis
on psychiatric care for criminals. She
cited at length the encounter of one
San Quentin inmate with the prison's
psychiatrist, who is now chief
psychiatrist for the California prison
system.
Accoiding to Miss Mitford, the
psychiatrist began the interview like
this:
"How are you feeling today?"
"Pretty good, I guess." replied the
prisoner.
"That's a pretty negative answer isn't
it?
"What's negative about it?"
"Ah Ha! So now you're asking the
questions are you?"
Miss Mitford pointed out that
neither the prisoner nor his counsel can
look at psychiatric evaluations kept in
the prisoner's "jacket," the file kept on
him throughout his imprisonment,
because "it would violate the hallowed
doctor patient relationship although
the FBI and the police are allowed to
see it."
