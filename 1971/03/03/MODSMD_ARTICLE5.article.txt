Those individuals blockading the dralt
board doors yesterday and those who have
been blockading the San Mateo draft board
sporadically since last week have taken a
much-needed and courageous step. It serves
yet another notice to the American
government that the 73 percent of the
American people who oppose our
involvement in Indochina will not all remain
mute while the government perpetuates the
destruction of the lands and the lives ot
Southeast Asian people. It also serves notice
on the frustrated, apathetic, and despairing
element of the peace movement that there
are more choices than bombing and trashing
on the one hand or acquiesence in
governmental murder on the other.
Now that the road of non-violent civil
disobedience is once again being attempted,
as it was at the Oakland Induction Center
over three years ago, we must look forward
to the eventual outcome of this protest. The
American government has been almost
completely deaf to this level ot protest tor
the last six years; there is no indication that
it is any more willing to listen now than it
has been in the past.
If the aim is to draw the government's
attention to the opposition of the American
people to America's war in order that the
government will stop the war in response, it
is difficult not to be pessimistic about the
outcome.
If the aim is for the participants to be
arrested, so that the constitutionality of the
war could be challenged within the
American court system, then it is sincerely
to be hoped that the demonstrators will
succeed; thus far, the American court system
has steadfastly rejected all efforts to raise
this constitutional issue.
The longer that the atrocity of the
Indochina war drags on, despite the

opposition of the majority of the American
people, the more difficult it is to be hopeful
about the success of any effort to end it. Vet
the fact that it is more difficult to hope after
so many disappointments, and even more
difficult to act, makes the actions taken
yesterday even more courageous. After the
consistent disregard that this nation has
shown toward the wishes of its citizens, and
the greater disregard it has shown for the
lives of a foreign people, it is easy to despair.
Too easy.
The men and women arrested at the draft
boards yesterday have not allowed
themselves the luxury of letting despair lead
them into apathy. It is indeed difficult to be
optimistic about the possibility of success
for their action; yet the very fact they acted,
and have shown the campus that there is an
alternative to apathy or trashing and
bombing, is a hopeful sign.
We urge these individuals, and all people
who consider themselves opposed to the
killing in Indochina, to go back to the draft
boards, or to engage in those acts of civil
disobedience which they feel most
necessary.
We cannot allow the government to
believe that we no longer care; we cannot
allow the court system to ignore the fact
that we are engaged in an illegal war. We
cannot allow ourselves the luxury of silenceâ€”
we have allowed it too along already.
As the protesters' statement said:
"We serve notice with our action thut the
war in hidoehina has escalated, and that
Americans must ensure that the murder
there stop immediately. It is not enough for
us merely to cry out against the killing.
"We recognize the risk entailed in our
actions. But these are far outweighed by the
consequences of our continued acquiesence
to this ilk'gal and immoral war. "
