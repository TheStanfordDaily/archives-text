This three part series will
develop the basics of this
continuum from the Tet Offensive
*of 4 68 on, and will simultaneously
search the "reasoning;" the
strategy of the U.S. from then on.
This first part will summarily treat
the period Feb. '68 to Dec. ' 70.
The Tet Offensive, the "strategic
* counter-offensive" of North
4 Vietnam's Gen. Giap's strategy to
defeat the U.S. and ARVN almost
became the U.S.'s Dienbienphu.
The catastrophically miscalculated

policies of the U.S. from '65 to
Feb. '68 complimented a
well-developed "underdog" image
for the NLF and North
Vietnamese Army (NVA)
internationally, as well as in South
Vietnam (SVN). The offensive
failed because of the logical
extension of the U.S. policy-the
utter devestation of all South
Vietnamese cities, (except Hue
and Saigon); and, surprizingly, the
national mobilization of the
South Vietnamese people against

the Communists, a reversal of the
previous sentiments.
This national mobilization
carried out various pruposes of
the U.S.'s Vietnamization
strategy: the complete capture
and/or execution of the VC
(NLF) infrastructure (logistics,
intelligence, troops barracking)
that supported the VC and NVA
in the field in South Vietnam; the
development of a real ARVN with
overwhelming volunteer
enlistment; and the slow
eradication of all known
Communist influences in South
Vietnam.
The U.S. found in the
mobilization a good means by
which to extricate itself from its
direct combative role, dictated by
political reality within the U.S. By
turning to a supportive air,
logistics, and aid prosecution of
the War, the government saw the
possibility of attrition-to-nego
tiation or direct defeat of the
Communists; simultaneously
casualties would go down,
Vietnamization (Nixon Doctrine)
would increase, and the economic
pinch of the War inflation would
tail off. By chance, the
Communists provided the perfect
mechanism for their own defeat.
But such chances lead to
changes in the Communist
strategy. While the VC turned
slowly back to guerilla and
terrorist warfare, the NVA found
a new opportunity, sanctuaries
along the SVN-Cambodian border.

Prince Sihanouk, in a four year
temper tantrum with the West,
found no defense against this. He
was completely taken over by the
Communist schemes.
The Chinese supplied the trucks
for shipping supplies from
Kompong Som to the sanctuaries;
the Chinese and Russian freighters
landing at Kompong Som brought
in most of the necessary supplies
to maintain combat at pre-Tet
levels. This continued from mid
'68 to April '7 0.
Besides the natural and
historical VN-Cambodian ethnic
enmity, Sihanouk himself knew
the Communists were his worst
enemies. So did then Lt. Col. Lon
Nol and most of the Cambodian
Army officer corps. They
therefore felt the government
should be changed. Knowing the
U.S. would support them
(through CIA information), Lon
Nol and the Army easily
overthrew Sihanouk in a bloodless
coup on April 13. Sihanouk had
only "allowed" a week or so of
supplies to develop in the
sanctuaries; the Communist were
then faced with the atrification of
their only lifeline with which to
fight the War in SVN. The Ho Chi
Minh Trail, could not supply the
amount of combat supplies
needed for the level of combat
prefered. After an unusually short
"wait-see" period, the U.S.
"recognized" the Lon Nol regime
and promised it aid.

The U.S. saw no bounds to its
fortune; the NVA was in the
ultimate bind. It was either
negotiation or defeat for the
Communists. Apparently, they
would negotiate. President Nixon
spoke to the nation and the world
a week later, saying the U.S.
would remove most of its combat
troops in a year and was very
interested in talking rather
thanfighting. At Paris and
elsewhere diplomats waited for
Communist compromise
proposals.
But between April 20 and April
30 the Communists turned to a
possibility that the U.S. hadn't
even reckoned on. Dropping all
pretenses, they started formal
aggression against the Cambodian
government, momentarily losing
their pristine reputation for being
only concerned with national
liberation. A two pronged attack
from the sanctuaries nearly
attained the toppline of the Lon
Nol regime, with the return of
Sihanouk as a Communist puppet;
and failing that, the building of a
30 mile wide corridor to the sea
to set up a new, more obvious,
and more permanent lifeline.
The U.S. found its fortune
startingly reversed. Within weeks
SVN would be surrounded by
Communist-held land and the sea
into which the Communists would
easily drive the ARVN and U.S.
With hastiness and complete lack
of international tact the U.S.
devised its only possible strategy
other than defeat or negotiation,
the Incursion with the speech of
Nixon, the U.S. introduced
ground forces on Cambodian soil
for 6 0 days. Vietnamization also
had its first showcase. The NVA
and VC had little choice but to
flee for their lives, and set up
bases in NE Cambodia and
Angkor Wat, sporadically supplied
from Southern Laos.
After six months, by Dec. '70,
all seemed calm in Indochina.
Until the Laos Invasion. The
second part tomorrow will relate
Cambodia, through U.S.
reasoning, to the Invasion.
