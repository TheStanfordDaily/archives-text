complicity
Editor, THE DAILY:
With this letter we want to
protest the presence of an
individual called Sioris who poses
as the Minister of Education of
Greece. He was appointed by
Colonel Papadopoulos who
usurped power four years ago and
has since ruled by brute force and
terror and with the outright
financial, political and military
support of the U.S. government,
Pentagon and CIA.
During his regime and Sioris'
term hundreds of Greek students
were jailed, sent to concentration
camps and tortured. Sioris now is
touring the U.S. and visiting its
educational institutions in
complete secrecy, which Stanford
has complied with.
Are the universities going to
accept an extention of the
American complicity to the
stifling of democracy in Greece by
receiving this criminal?

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is too bad the Daily did not
consider as newsworthy the names
of the 55 faculty members who
challenged the University on its
attempt to exclude people and
organizations from our campus by
injunction. By this letter I whsh
to identify myself as a signer of
the faculty intervention against
the injunction.
Nuremberg prosecutor Telford
Taylor asserts that the United

States is guilty today of the same
kinds of war crimes for which
Nazis were tried and convicted at
Nuremberg. If this is true, we all
have a positive obligation, legal as
well as moral, not only to protest,
but to refuse cooperation and try
to impede these criminal actions
taken in our name.
What was really outrageous and
provocative in the Lodge incident
was that a war criminal should
have been invited here as a guest
of the University. I consider that
Professor Franklin and others did
us a service and did honor to this
University by their sharp and clear
response to this provocation.
It is hard to accept that one's
own government has forfeited
respect and allegiance of its
citizens, that our leaders are
criminals or lunatics who, in
flagrant disregard of the
Constitution, are leading us down
the road to nuclear annihilation.
The Nuremberg precedent
imposes on us an obligation to
resist this evil — an obligation that
transcends both national laws and
University regulations.
Associate Provost Rosenzweig,
complaining that our petition
against the injunction "seems to
float in the air some distance from
the real world," says that the
"open clash of ideas" is the only
battle that should be fought
within the University. This
beautiful sentiment can be
translated as follows: Discuss, if
you must, the University's
complicity in the war, its direct
and indirect contributions to the
war, and the benefits it reaps from
the slaughter of Asians. But do

not let your thoughts lead to
action, or we will ban you from
the campus.
I too want to see the University
preserved. But the only way to
preserve what is worthwhile in it
is to remove it totally and quickly
from the service of the military.
This may require considerable
change in its structure and
governance.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Associate Provost Rosenzweig's
reply to the petition by 55 faculty
members opposing the injunction
indicates one of two possibilities:
either he has not read the
requested injunction or he is a
hatchet man with a velvet tongue.
He claims the acts enjoined are
specifically enumerated.
What he fails to state is that the
injunction also enjoins persons
from directly or indirectly causing
any of the enumerated acts. Think
of all the possible actions that
someone could say indirectly
caused a mill-in at the Old Union
and you will realize the potential
danger of the proposed
injunction. Rosenzweig's response
is nothing more than a
prophylactic — it tries to give
people a sense of security while
they're getting screwed.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The March 1 letter by Mr.
Charles S. Weaver demonstrates
little more than a gross ignorance
of the circumstances of the Hue
"massacres." It seems Mr. Weaver
has relied only upon information
he gleaned from the American
press at the time. We would
humbly remind him that the
American press has exaggerated
and misrepresented information
before.
The circumstances of the Hue
killing leave little doubt as to who
was most responsible. During the
Tet offensive of 1968, the NLF
and DRV forces occupied the city
of Hue, and were responsible for
killing approximately 2 00 people -
not the 4700 citizens that Mr.
Weaver cites (This estimate of 200
people was made by Doan Cong
Lap, Police Chief of Hue, and
reported on the London Times,
March 27, 1968 ). Two
researchers, D. Gareth Porter and
Len E. Ackland (Christian
Century, 1969), have stated that
those killed by the NLF were civil
servants, i.e. policemen and
soldiers, employees of the
Americans, and members of the
old right-wing nationalist party,
certainly not the priests
mentioned in Mr. Weaver's
allegations.
To regain Hue from"the
enemy", American air and naval
power launched a two pronged
assault on the city. Utilizing
napalm, nausea gas, and mass
bombings, the U.S. wiped out 70
of the civilian homes in Hue, with
116,000 of 145,000 residents
becoming refugees in their own
city. (Kahin and Lewis, The
United States in Vietnam, p. 373).
In spite of massacring over
2600 civilians (Edward S.
Herman, Atrocities in Vietnam),
the United States did regain the
city of Hue on Feb. 24 ,1968.
We would ask Mr. Weaver that
he should examine the evidence, all
the evidence, before making any
conclusions about the NLF. If he
does not believe that Americans
can commit atrocities on an
innocent people; indeed, if he
does not believe that those
atrocities are an integral part of
American military policy in
Vietnam, will he please examine
napalm, anti-personnel bombs,
free-fire zones American
pacification programs, and
policies of reprisal. Finally, we ask
Mr. Weaver to listen to the Winter
Soldier Investigations on KZSU
which began yesterday.

How many Daily readers reject
president Lyman's analysis of the
campus anti-war movement, and
disavow his suspending H. Bruce
Franklin and seeking the
injunction that makes us all John
Does?
I'm suggesting a non-violent,
through-channels response that
attacks the University's central
reason for its recent actions, This
all comes down because Stanford
wants its alumni and moneyed
supporters to think the school is
successfully controlling dissent
and keeping academic freedom
academic. We can respond by
urging these same contributors to
withhold all funds from Stanford
until the University proves its
allegations against Franklin or
re-instates him, and drops the
unconstitutional injunction.
You all know one potential
contributor besides yourself—your
parents. Counter the SUN Fund's
recent mailing with a letter of
your own. Make sure your
contacts not only withhold
contributions, but write Stanford
explaining exactly why they are
doing so. You might urge the
really politically-conscious ones to
donate their usual Stanford
contribution to the medical relief
fund for Laotian and North
Vietnamese war victims.
If you reject the slogan that all
political power comes out of the
barrel of a gun, consider that a lot
of political power can come out
of your wallet.

Editor, THE DAILY:
To some of our ivory-towered,
ill-informed, intellectuals (?)
whose theoretical ideas, while
commendable, cannot be
instantaneously applied to the real
world where your goals are not
even considered, stop running
around like "Chicken Little"
screaming "Strike the University,
Strike the University" and look at
some facts.
Your rallies, action groups,
meetings, etc., have failed to
gather public support for many
reasons to include one which is
probably shocking to you, namely
that some people agree with the
recent action in Laos. Hell, it's
about time, and is obviously one
of the better military
undertakings ventured by the
South Vietnamese. I know,
scream of military aggression
invasion, deceit, and betrayal;
you've voiced your opinion of
violations of the Geneva Accord
and Laotian sovereignty so loud
and long that it's only empty
chatter.
I don't believe that the South
Vietnamese are killing Laotian
citizens, on the contrary, with our
help they are killing North
Vietnamese invasion forces and
destroying Russian and Chinese
equipment - see any parallel? The
North Vietnamese have been
bullying that neutral country for
over six years and using it as a
base in their invasion of the
sovereign Republic of South
Vietnam - that facade of a civil
war or self determination was
plainly obvious back in 1965.
Many US and South Vietnamese
have died at the hands of the
North Vietnamese Communists in
South Vietnam.
Chicken Little, you want to
beat the drum about violating
Laotian neutrality, well the sky
fell in there six years ago.
Personally, I think the move into
Laos is to you just a vehicle to
make noise, gather a band of
other empty headed chicks and
ruifle your feathers; but this time
you've laid an egg - and it's
tragically humorous.
No, too wrongs don't make a
right and Laotian neutrality
should be observed, but by both
sides. The sky isn't falling; maybe
in a painful way it's being
repaired, but even that may be
too late.

Associate Provost Rosenzweig,
complaining that our petition

beautiful sentiment can be
translated as follows: Discuss, if
you must, the University's
complicity in the war, its direct
and indirect contributions to the
war, and the benefits it reaps from
the slaughter of Asians. But do

not let your thoughts lead to
action, or we will ban you from
the campus.

Associate Provost Rosenzweig's
reply to the petition by 55 faculty
members opposing the injunction
indicates one of two possibilities:
either he has not read the
requested injunction or he is a
hatchet man with a velvet tongue.
He claims the acts enjoined are
specifically enumerated.
What he fails to state is that the
injunction also enjoins persons
from directly or indirectly causing
any of the enumerated acts. Think
of all the possible actions that
someone could say indirectly
caused a mill-in at the Old Union

The March 1 letter by Mr.
Charles S. Weaver demonstrates
little more than a gross ignorance
of the circumstances of the Hue
"massacres." It seems Mr. Weaver
has relied only upon information
he gleaned from the American
press at the time. We would
humbly remind him that the
American press has exaggerated
and misrepresented information
before.
The circumstances of the Hue
killing leave little doubt as to who
was most responsible. During the
Tet offensive of 1968, the NLF
and DRV forces occupied the city
of Hue, and were responsible for
killing approximately 2 00 people -
not the 4700 citizens that Mr.
Weaver cites (This estimate of 200
people was made by Doan Cong
Lap, Police Chief of Hue, and
reported on the London Times,
March 27, 1968 ). Two
researchers, D. Gareth Porter and
Len E. Ackland (Christian
Century, 1969), have stated that
those killed by the NLF were civil
servants, i.e. policemen and
soldiers, employees of the
Americans, and members of the
old right-wing nationalist party,
certainly not the priests
mentioned in Mr. Weaver's
allegations.
To regain Hue from"the
enemy", American air and naval
power launched a two pronged
assault on the city. Utilizing
napalm, nausea gas, and mass
bombings, the U.S. wiped out 70
of the civilian homes in Hue, with
116,000 of 145,000 residents
becoming refugees in their own
city. (Kahin and Lewis, The
United States in Vietnam, p. 373).
In spite of massacring over
2600 civilians (Edward S.
Herman, Atrocities in Vietnam),
the United States did regain the
city of Hue on Feb. 24 ,1968.
We would ask Mr. Weaver that
he should examine the evidence, all
the evidence, before making any
conclusions about the NLF. If he
does not believe that Americans
can commit atrocities on an
innocent people; indeed, if he
does not believe that those
atrocities are an integral part of
American military policy in
Vietnam, will he please examine
napalm, anti-personnel bombs,
free-fire zones American
pacification programs, and
policies of reprisal. Finally, we ask
Mr. Weaver to listen to the Winter
Soldier Investigations on KZSU
which began yesterday.

How many Daily readers reject

disavow his suspending H. Bruce
Franklin and seeking the
injunction that makes us all John
Does?
I'm suggesting a non-violent,
through-channels response that
attacks the University's central
reason for its recent actions, This
all comes down because Stanford
wants its alumni and moneyed
supporters to think the school is
successfully controlling dissent
and keeping academic freedom
academic. We can respond by
urging these same contributors to
withhold all funds from Stanford
until the University proves its
allegations against Franklin or
re-instates him, and drops the
unconstitutional injunction.
You all know one potential
contributor besides yourself—your
parents. Counter the SUN Fund's
recent mailing with a letter of
your own. Make sure your
contacts not only withhold
contributions, but write Stanford
explaining exactly why they are
doing so. You might urge the
really politically-conscious ones to
donate their usual Stanford
contribution to the medical relief
fund for Laotian and North
Vietnamese war victims.

To some of our ivory-towered,
ill-informed, intellectuals (?)
whose theoretical ideas, while
commendable, cannot be
instantaneously applied to the real
world where your goals are not
even considered, stop running
around like "Chicken Little"
screaming "Strike the University,
Strike the University" and look at
some facts.
Your rallies, action groups,
meetings, etc., have failed to
gather public support for many
reasons to include one which is
probably shocking to you, namely
that some people agree with the
recent action in Laos. Hell, it's
about time, and is obviously one
of the better military
undertakings ventured by the
South Vietnamese. I know,
scream of military aggression
invasion, deceit, and betrayal;
you've voiced your opinion of
violations of the Geneva Accord
and Laotian sovereignty so loud
and long that it's only empty
chatter.
I don't believe that the South
Vietnamese are killing Laotian
citizens, on the contrary, with our
help they are killing North
Vietnamese invasion forces and
destroying Russian and Chinese
equipment - see any parallel? The
North Vietnamese have been
bullying that neutral country for
over six years and using it as a
base in their invasion of the
sovereign Republic of South
Vietnam - that facade of a civil
war or self determination was
plainly obvious back in 1965.
Many US and South Vietnamese
have died at the hands of the
North Vietnamese Communists in
South Vietnam.
Chicken Little, you want to
beat the drum about violating
Laotian neutrality, well the sky
fell in there six years ago.
Personally, I think the move into
Laos is to you just a vehicle to
make noise, gather a band of
other empty headed chicks and
ruifle your feathers; but this time
you've laid an egg - and it's
tragically humorous.
No, too wrongs don't make a
right and Laotian neutrality
should be observed, but by both
sides. The sky isn't falling; maybe
in a painful way it's being
repaired, but even that may be
too late.

With this letter we want to

Colonel Papadopoulos who
usurped power four years ago and
has since ruled by brute force and
terror and with the outright
financial, political and military
support of the U.S. government,
Pentagon and CIA.
During his regime and Sioris'

were jailed, sent to concentration
camps and tortured. Sioris now is
touring the U.S. and visiting its
educational institutions in

has complied with.

Nuremberg prosecutor Telford

Nazis were tried and convicted at
Nuremberg. If this is true, we all

but to refuse cooperation and try
to impede these criminal actions
taken in our name.
What was really outrageous and
provocative in the Lodge incident
was that a war criminal should
have been invited here as a guest
of the University. I consider that
Professor Franklin and others did
us a service and did honor to this
University by their sharp and clear
response to this provocation.
It is hard to accept that one's
own government has forfeited
respect and allegiance of its
citizens, that our leaders are
criminals or lunatics who, in
flagrant disregard of the

of Hue, and were responsible for
killing approximately 2 00 people -
not the 4700 citizens that Mr.
Weaver cites (This estimate of 200
people was made by Doan Cong
Lap, Police Chief of Hue, and
reported on the London Times,
March 27, 1968 ). Two
researchers, D. Gareth Porter and
Len E. Ackland (Christian
Century, 1969), have stated that
those killed by the NLF were civil
servants, i.e. policemen and
soldiers, employees of the
Americans, and members of the
old right-wing nationalist party,
certainly not the priests
mentioned in Mr. Weaver's
allegations.
To regain Hue from"the
enemy", American air and naval
power launched a two pronged
assault on the city. Utilizing
napalm, nausea gas, and mass
bombings, the U.S. wiped out 70
of the civilian homes in Hue, with
116,000 of 145,000 residents
becoming refugees in their own
city. (Kahin and Lewis, The
United States in Vietnam, p. 373).
In spite of massacring over
2600 civilians (Edward S.
Herman, Atrocities in Vietnam),
the United States did regain the
city of Hue on Feb. 24 ,1968.
We would ask Mr. Weaver that
he should examine the evidence, all
the evidence, before making any
conclusions about the NLF. If he
does not believe that Americans
can commit atrocities on an
innocent people; indeed, if he
does not believe that those
atrocities are an integral part of
American military policy in
Vietnam, will he please examine
napalm, anti-personnel bombs,
free-fire zones American
pacification programs, and
policies of reprisal. Finally, we ask
Mr. Weaver to listen to the Winter
Soldier Investigations on KZSU
which began yesterday.

How many Daily readers reject

disavow his suspending H. Bruce
Franklin and seeking the
injunction that makes us all John
Does?
I'm suggesting a non-violent,
through-channels response that
attacks the University's central
reason for its recent actions, This
all comes down because Stanford
wants its alumni and moneyed
supporters to think the school is
successfully controlling dissent
and keeping academic freedom
academic. We can respond by
urging these same contributors to
withhold all funds from Stanford
until the University proves its
allegations against Franklin or
re-instates him, and drops the
unconstitutional injunction.
You all know one potential
contributor besides yourself—your
parents. Counter the SUN Fund's
recent mailing with a letter of
your own. Make sure your
contacts not only withhold
contributions, but write Stanford
explaining exactly why they are
doing so. You might urge the
really politically-conscious ones to
donate their usual Stanford
contribution to the medical relief
fund for Laotian and North
Vietnamese war victims.
If you reject the slogan that all

To some of our ivory-towered,
ill-informed, intellectuals (?)
whose theoretical ideas, while
commendable, cannot be
instantaneously applied to the real
world where your goals are not
even considered, stop running
around like "Chicken Little"
screaming "Strike the University,
Strike the University" and look at
some facts.
Your rallies, action groups,
meetings, etc., have failed to
gather public support for many
reasons to include one which is
probably shocking to you, namely
that some people agree with the
recent action in Laos. Hell, it's
about time, and is obviously one
of the better military
undertakings ventured by the
South Vietnamese. I know,
scream of military aggression
invasion, deceit, and betrayal;
you've voiced your opinion of
violations of the Geneva Accord
and Laotian sovereignty so loud
and long that it's only empty
chatter.
I don't believe that the South
Vietnamese are killing Laotian
citizens, on the contrary, with our
help they are killing North
Vietnamese invasion forces and
destroying Russian and Chinese
equipment - see any parallel? The
North Vietnamese have been
bullying that neutral country for
over six years and using it as a
base in their invasion of the
sovereign Republic of South
Vietnam - that facade of a civil
war or self determination was
plainly obvious back in 1965.
Many US and South Vietnamese
have died at the hands of the
North Vietnamese Communists in
South Vietnam.
Chicken Little, you want to
beat the drum about violating
Laotian neutrality, well the sky
fell in there six years ago.
Personally, I think the move into
Laos is to you just a vehicle to
make noise, gather a band of
other empty headed chicks and
ruifle your feathers; but this time
you've laid an egg - and it's
tragically humorous.
No, too wrongs don't make a
right and Laotian neutrality
should be observed, but by both
sides. The sky isn't falling; maybe
in a painful way it's being
repaired, but even that may be
too late.

Editor, THE DAILY:
With this letter we want to
protest the presence of an
individual called Sioris who poses
as the Minister of Education of
Greece. He was appointed by
Colonel Papadopoulos who
usurped power four years ago and
has since ruled by brute force and
terror and with the outright
financial, political and military
support of the U.S. government,
Pentagon and CIA.
During his regime and Sioris'
term hundreds of Greek students
were jailed, sent to concentration
camps and tortured. Sioris now is
touring the U.S. and visiting its
educational institutions in
complete secrecy, which Stanford
has complied with.
Are the universities going to
accept an extention of the
American complicity to the
stifling of democracy in Greece by
receiving this criminal?

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is too bad the Daily did not
consider as newsworthy the names
of the 55 faculty members who
challenged the University on its
attempt to exclude people and
organizations from our campus by
injunction. By this letter I whsh
to identify myself as a signer of
the faculty intervention against
the injunction.
Nuremberg prosecutor Telford
Taylor asserts that the United

States is guilty today of the same
kinds of war crimes for which
Nazis were tried and convicted at
Nuremberg. If this is true, we all
have a positive obligation, legal as
well as moral, not only to protest,
but to refuse cooperation and try
to impede these criminal actions
taken in our name.
What was really outrageous and
provocative in the Lodge incident
was that a war criminal should
have been invited here as a guest
of the University. I consider that
Professor Franklin and others did
us a service and did honor to this
University by their sharp and clear
response to this provocation.
It is hard to accept that one's
own government has forfeited
respect and allegiance of its
citizens, that our leaders are
criminals or lunatics who, in
flagrant disregard of the
Constitution, are leading us down
the road to nuclear annihilation.
The Nuremberg precedent
imposes on us an obligation to
resist this evil — an obligation that
transcends both national laws and
University regulations.
Associate Provost Rosenzweig,
complaining that our petition
against the injunction "seems to
float in the air some distance from
the real world," says that the
"open clash of ideas" is the only
battle that should be fought
within the University. This
beautiful sentiment can be
translated as follows: Discuss, if
you must, the University's
complicity in the war, its direct
and indirect contributions to the
war, and the benefits it reaps from
the slaughter of Asians. But do

not let your thoughts lead to
action, or we will ban you from
the campus.
I too want to see the University
preserved. But the only way to
preserve what is worthwhile in it
is to remove it totally and quickly
from the service of the military.
This may require considerable
change in its structure and
governance.

He claims the acts enjoined are

What he fails to state is that the

any of the enumerated acts. Think
of all the possible actions that
someone could say indirectly
caused a mill-in at the Old Union

To some of our ivory-towered,

whose theoretical ideas, while
commendable, cannot be
instantaneously applied to the real
world where your goals are not
even considered, stop running
around like "Chicken Little"
screaming "Strike the University,

Your rallies, action groups,

gather public support for many
reasons to include one which is
probably shocking to you, namely
that some people agree with the
recent action in Laos. Hell, it's
about time, and is obviously one
of the better military
undertakings ventured by the
South Vietnamese. I know,
scream of military aggression
invasion, deceit, and betrayal;
you've voiced your opinion of
violations of the Geneva Accord
and Laotian sovereignty so loud
and long that it's only empty
chatter.
I don't believe that the South
Vietnamese are killing Laotian
citizens, on the contrary, with our
help they are killing North
Vietnamese invasion forces and
destroying Russian and Chinese
equipment - see any parallel? The
North Vietnamese have been
bullying that neutral country for
over six years and using it as a
base in their invasion of the
sovereign Republic of South
Vietnam - that facade of a civil
war or self determination was
plainly obvious back in 1965.
Many US and South Vietnamese
have died at the hands of the
North Vietnamese Communists in
South Vietnam.
Chicken Little, you want to
beat the drum about violating
Laotian neutrality, well the sky
fell in there six years ago.
Personally, I think the move into
Laos is to you just a vehicle to
make noise, gather a band of
other empty headed chicks and
ruifle your feathers; but this time
you've laid an egg - and it's
tragically humorous.
No, too wrongs don't make a
right and Laotian neutrality
should be observed, but by both
sides. The sky isn't falling; maybe
in a painful way it's being
repaired, but even that may be
too late.

With this letter we want to
protest the presence of an
individual called Sioris who poses
as the Minister of Education of
Greece. He was appointed by
Colonel Papadopoulos who
usurped power four years ago and
has since ruled by brute force and
terror and with the outright
financial, political and military
support of the U.S. government,
Pentagon and CIA.
During his regime and Sioris'
term hundreds of Greek students
were jailed, sent to concentration
camps and tortured. Sioris now is
touring the U.S. and visiting its
educational institutions in
complete secrecy, which Stanford
has complied with.
Are the universities going to

It is too bad the Daily did not
consider as newsworthy the names
of the 55 faculty members who
challenged the University on its
attempt to exclude people and
organizations from our campus by
injunction. By this letter I whsh
to identify myself as a signer of
the faculty intervention against
the injunction.
Nuremberg prosecutor Telford
Taylor asserts that the United

States is guilty today of the same
kinds of war crimes for which
Nazis were tried and convicted at
Nuremberg. If this is true, we all
have a positive obligation, legal as
well as moral, not only to protest,
but to refuse cooperation and try
to impede these criminal actions
taken in our name.
What was really outrageous and
provocative in the Lodge incident
was that a war criminal should
have been invited here as a guest
of the University. I consider that
Professor Franklin and others did
us a service and did honor to this
University by their sharp and clear
response to this provocation.
It is hard to accept that one's
own government has forfeited
respect and allegiance of its
citizens, that our leaders are
criminals or lunatics who, in
flagrant disregard of the
Constitution, are leading us down
the road to nuclear annihilation.
The Nuremberg precedent
imposes on us an obligation to
resist this evil — an obligation that
transcends both national laws and
University regulations.
Associate Provost Rosenzweig,
complaining that our petition
against the injunction "seems to
float in the air some distance from
the real world," says that the
"open clash of ideas" is the only
battle that should be fought
within the University. This
beautiful sentiment can be
translated as follows: Discuss, if
you must, the University's
complicity in the war, its direct
and indirect contributions to the
war, and the benefits it reaps from
the slaughter of Asians. But do

not let your thoughts lead to
action, or we will ban you from
the campus.
I too want to see the University
preserved. But the only way to
preserve what is worthwhile in it
is to remove it totally and quickly
from the service of the military.
This may require considerable
change in its structure and
governance.

reply to the petition by 55 faculty
members opposing the injunction
indicates one of two possibilities:
either he has not read the
requested injunction or he is a

He claims the acts enjoined are
specifically enumerated.
What he fails to state is that the
injunction also enjoins persons
from directly or indirectly causing
any of the enumerated acts. Think
of all the possible actions that
someone could say indirectly
caused a mill-in at the Old Union

Editor, THE DAILY:
The March 1 letter by Mr.
Charles S. Weaver demonstrates
little more than a gross ignorance
of the circumstances of the Hue
"massacres." It seems Mr. Weaver
has relied only upon information
he gleaned from the American
press at the time. We would
humbly remind him that the
American press has exaggerated
and misrepresented information
before.
The circumstances of the Hue
killing leave little doubt as to who
was most responsible. During the
Tet offensive of 1968, the NLF
and DRV forces occupied the city
of Hue, and were responsible for
killing approximately 2 00 people -
not the 4700 citizens that Mr.
Weaver cites (This estimate of 200
people was made by Doan Cong
Lap, Police Chief of Hue, and
reported on the London Times,
March 27, 1968 ). Two
researchers, D. Gareth Porter and
Len E. Ackland (Christian
Century, 1969), have stated that
those killed by the NLF were civil
servants, i.e. policemen and
soldiers, employees of the
Americans, and members of the
old right-wing nationalist party,
certainly not the priests
mentioned in Mr. Weaver's
allegations.
To regain Hue from"the
enemy", American air and naval
power launched a two pronged
assault on the city. Utilizing
napalm, nausea gas, and mass
bombings, the U.S. wiped out 70
of the civilian homes in Hue, with
116,000 of 145,000 residents
becoming refugees in their own
city. (Kahin and Lewis, The
United States in Vietnam, p. 373).
In spite of massacring over
2600 civilians (Edward S.
Herman, Atrocities in Vietnam),
the United States did regain the
city of Hue on Feb. 24 ,1968.
We would ask Mr. Weaver that
he should examine the evidence, all
the evidence, before making any
conclusions about the NLF. If he
does not believe that Americans
can commit atrocities on an
innocent people; indeed, if he
does not believe that those
atrocities are an integral part of
American military policy in
Vietnam, will he please examine
napalm, anti-personnel bombs,
free-fire zones American
pacification programs, and
policies of reprisal. Finally, we ask
Mr. Weaver to listen to the Winter
Soldier Investigations on KZSU
which began yesterday.

help they are killing North
Vietnamese invasion forces and
destroying Russian and Chinese
equipment - see any parallel? The
North Vietnamese have been
bullying that neutral country for
over six years and using it as a
base in their invasion of the
sovereign Republic of South
Vietnam - that facade of a civil
war or self determination was
plainly obvious back in 1965.
Many US and South Vietnamese
have died at the hands of the
North Vietnamese Communists in
South Vietnam.
Chicken Little, you want to
beat the drum about violating
Laotian neutrality, well the sky
fell in there six years ago.
Personally, I think the move into
Laos is to you just a vehicle to
make noise, gather a band of
other empty headed chicks and
ruifle your feathers; but this time
you've laid an egg - and it's
tragically humorous.
No, too wrongs don't make a
right and Laotian neutrality
should be observed, but by both
sides. The sky isn't falling; maybe
in a painful way it's being
repaired, but even that may be
too late.
