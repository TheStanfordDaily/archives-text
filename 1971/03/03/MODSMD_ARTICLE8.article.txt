# Stanford Patent Program Helps Market Inventions
## 
### ROBIN STICKNEY 
Now inventiveness pays—in
case—at Stanford. Student,
faculty, and staff inventors may
choose to develop an idea under
the University's new patent and
licensing program and will receive
approximately one-third of all
income from its production.
The new program, which was
set up to facilitate transfer of
ideas from laboratory to
marketplace, is already bringing in
over $60,000 per year.
Furthermore, the payments to
date are merely advances on six
ideas, none of which has yet
reached commercial production
and earned royalties. Patent office
manager Neils Reimers expects
much greater returns from
marketing of the actual products.
The six current inventions from
which Reimers has found licensees
come from the Chemistry, Music,
Medicine, and Applied Physics
Departments.
The six include:
—a musical device which
involves computerized,
"omniphonic" sound, with an
aircraft-type joystick that controls
the apparent location of the
source.
—An applied physics invention,
will use sound waves to produce a
visible image in accoustic
microscopes and similar devices.
—From the department of
chemistry, a synthetic "juvenile
hormone" will limit some insect
populations without adding to
environmental pollution. The
hormone prevents certain insect
species from maturing and
therefore from reproducing.
—A series of compounds which
may prove able to stimulate the
body's production of
"interferon," a protein
manufactured in response to
infection, are under intensive
study in the Department of
Medicine's Infectious Diseases
Laboratory.

—A valve for extremely high
pressures and a new process for
making ammonia are two other
innovations which have been
accepted for the program.
Since the new policy went into
effect, about seventy ideas and
inventions have been considered.
Forty were eventually dropped
because they were judged either
non-patentable or
non-marketable.
"I have been particularly
pleased at the high societal value
of inventions we have licensed or
are licensing," says Dr. William F.
Miller, Vice President for
Research at Stanford.
The patent program operates
on a royalty sharing basis. An
inventor receives approximately
one-third of any income from his
invention. One-third of the
remaining money is directed
immediately back to the
inventor's department for further
unspecified research, and
one-third goes to university
unrestricted funds.
Although the program is a
potentially lucartive one, Mr.
Reimers has stressed that the basic
research purposes of the
university have priority. Research
personnel have not been
encouraged to direct efforts to
patentable and marketable ideas
rather than to advancing
fundamental knowledge.
A Stanford inventor is under no
obligation to use the Stanford
plan either. He is free to patent,
develop, and license an invention
on his own, unless the agency
sponsoring his work has made
other restrictions.
The pilot licensing operation
was begun on a part-time basis
two years ago with Frank
Newman, Neils Reimers and Sally
Hines. The program quickly paid
for itself and more. It proved to
be a promising source of
additional income for the

university. However, its first
purpose is to bring basic research
results quickly to public use
through licensing innovations for
industrial development.
In university research,
patentable ideas are usually in
"concept" form rather than
hardware. An academic invention,
often referred to as a "bare bones
patent," is remote from the
industrial market to begin with
and perishable if unlicensed.
Companies cannot afford to
develop an idea without patent
protection, which provides some
assurance that the development
capital will see a return.
The licensing program provides
a degree of flexibility in the
relationship between university
and industry not possible without
a mediator or "buffer," while the
patent option encourages a
company to invest personnel, time
and financial resources to develop
an invention.
