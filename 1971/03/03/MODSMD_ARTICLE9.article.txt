# Stanford Student Delivers More Anti-Draft Testimony

WASHINGTON, D.C. -
Congressional extension of the
draft will condemn "thousands of
idealistic Americans to prison or
exile," Stanford freshman Peter
Knutson said in testimony
prepared for delivery to the House
Armed Services Committee here
yesterday.
The 18-year-old political
science major from Everett,
Washington, made an impassioned
plea for an immediate halt to the
draft in his second Congressional
appearance since February 8.
Charging that the draft affects
"thousands of young Americans
whose only crime is a love for
freedom and an abhorrence of the
Vietnam war," Knutson told the
House committee:
"The draft must be ended
nowâ€”it has no place in an open
society. Any country which must
force people to fight for it cannot
be a country worth defending.
Any country which is worth
defending will be defended by its
citizens. Free people will defend
free institutions.
"Your generation," he
continued, "has taught us that
freedom is the most sacred of all
values. And you have taught us
well. We truly believe in the
Declaration of Independence and
the Bill of Rights as noble
expressions of man's right to
freedom. But it is not sufficient to
believe in those documents in a
merely abstract sense: Their spirit
must be put into practice if they

are to be more than scraps of
paper.
"However, those of us who are
like David Harris have put those
principles into practice, those of
us who truly live our freedom,
have found that we are jailed or
exiled for that act. We are devoted
to ideals, not institutions."
(Harris, husband of singer Joan
Baez and former Stanford student
body president, was jailed in July
19 68 for refusing induction. Now
in Federal prison, he is expected
to be released later this month.)
Knutson said it was Harris and
"hundreds of war resisters in the
prisons of this nation" who
should be testifying before them
today.
