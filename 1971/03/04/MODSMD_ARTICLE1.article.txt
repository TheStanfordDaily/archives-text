# Panofsky:SLAC's Cautious Activist
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
"It's a two-mile long tool shed up in the hills."
"One end of the tub 3's lower than the other so that
when the power fails, the electrons can roll down."
These are only a few of the myths offered in
description and definition of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). Like the topics of most
myths, SLAC is a mystery to many - an isolated
appendage to the university serving as a center for
esoteric research.
The hero of these myths, SLAC Director Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, is much more familiar and more
readily understood than the institution he heads.
Whether speaking before a Political Science 138 a class
or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Panofsky
offers an authoritative view on issues relating to his
field of nuclear physics.
Winner of the National Medal of Science and a
leader in the field of high-energy physics, the 52
year-old scientist is described by his associates as a
man with boundless energy and a patient and open
manner. In his position at SLAC and in his private
life, he is dedicated to helping people learn.
Panofsky cannot be considered a political figure;
he is quite concerned about the tendency of some
scientists to "stick their necks out in areas beyond
the range of their competence," and is quite cautious
and precise in his public statements. But neither can
he be seen as a preoccupied scientist buried in the
study of pi-mesons and neglecting the rest of the

world. Instead, he is concerned over contemporary
problems, and expresses his concern within his fields
of notable competence - nuclear armaments, research,
and administration.
'Cautious Activist'
A "cautious activist," Panofsky approaches
problems in a precise and careful manner and
comments only on problems lying within his fields of
expertise. But when he feels competent to speak on
an issue, he expresses his concern quite forcefully.
Panofsky's influence is particularly great in the
area of arms control and disarmament. Acquiring a
Ph.D. from Cal. Tech. in 1942, he worked on the
Manhattan Project during WWII. In 1959, he served as
chairman of a U.S. Geneva delegation working on the
technical problems of high altitude nuclear test
detection.
Most recently, the SLAC Director was called upon
to testify before the Senate Armed Services and
Foreign Relations Committees. His testimony proved
particularly disconcerting to Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard. During hearings before the
Foreign Relations Disarmament Subcommittee early
this summer, Packard was pressed to name
non-Pentagon advisers he had consulted on the ABM
question. Packard named Panofsky; the men had
chatted briefly during a casual meeting at the airport.
Panofsky was called before the committee, where
he immediately denied Packard's report. "To clarify
the record," he began, "I would like to state that I

did not participate in any advisory capacity to any
branch of the government in reviewing the decision to
deploy the current modified Sentinel or Safeguard
system." He went on to criticize the Nixon ABM
proposal, stating, "There can no longer be any
question that the ABM has escalated and will
continue to escalate the arms race."
What is the basis for his concern? Speaking before
a number of groups in the Stanford area, he has
pointed out the costs of weapons development. "The
total income of those people living in the
underdeveloped part of the world in Latin America,
the Middle East, and Southern Asia is less than the
outlay of the world for military purposes . . . The
world's stockpile of nuclear weapons amounts to
more than ten tons' equivalent of TNT for every man,
woman, and child on the globe."
Survival of Civilization
Yet cost is not his most salient objection to the
arms race. Rather, he calls the arms race "the threat
of a war so destructive as to endanger the very
survival of civilization ..."
Reading a meticulously worded speech to his
audiences, Panofsky carefully explains some
fundamental causes of the arms race. He points out
that both American and Russian strategic policies
tend to be ambiguous, striving to both deter nuclear
war and to maintain the ability to "limit damage"
and to "fight a war and prevail " should deterence

HIGH ENERGY PHYSlCS—Wolfgang Panofsky, head of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator (SLAC), is described by friends as like the subnuclear particles he
studies ■ full of energy. Whether it's before Poli, Sci, 138 a or the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, he offers authoritative views on subjects ranging from high
energy physics to nuclear disarmament.
