# Panofsky:SLAC's Cautious Activist
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
"It's a two-mile long tool shed up in the hills."
"One end of the tub 3's lower than the other so that
when the power fails, the electrons can roll down."
These are only a few of the myths offered in
description and definition of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center (SLAC). Like the topics of most
myths, SLAC is a mystery to many - an isolated
appendage to the university serving as a center for
esoteric research.
The hero of these myths, SLAC Director Wolfgang
K.H. Panofsky, is much more familiar and more
readily understood than the institution he heads.
Whether speaking before a Political Science 138 a class
or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Panofsky
offers an authoritative view on issues relating to his
field of nuclear physics.
Winner of the National Medal of Science and a
leader in the field of high-energy physics, the 52
year-old scientist is described by his associates as a
man with boundless energy and a patient and open
manner. In his position at SLAC and in his private
life, he is dedicated to helping people learn.
Panofsky cannot be considered a political figure;
he is quite concerned about the tendency of some
scientists to "stick their necks out in areas beyond
the range of their competence," and is quite cautious
and precise in his public statements. But neither can
he be seen as a preoccupied scientist buried in the
study of pi-mesons and neglecting the rest of the

world. Instead, he is concerned over contemporary
problems, and expresses his concern within his fields
of notable competence - nuclear armaments, research,
and administration.
'Cautious Activist'
A "cautious activist," Panofsky approaches
problems in a precise and careful manner and
comments only on problems lying within his fields of
expertise. But when he feels competent to speak on
an issue, he expresses his concern quite forcefully.
Panofsky's influence is particularly great in the
area of arms control and disarmament. Acquiring a
Ph.D. from Cal. Tech. in 1942, he worked on the
Manhattan Project during WWII. In 1959, he served as
chairman of a U.S. Geneva delegation working on the
technical problems of high altitude nuclear test
detection.
Most recently, the SLAC Director was called upon
to testify before the Senate Armed Services and
Foreign Relations Committees. His testimony proved
particularly disconcerting to Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard. During hearings before the
Foreign Relations Disarmament Subcommittee early
this summer, Packard was pressed to name
non-Pentagon advisers he had consulted on the ABM
question. Packard named Panofsky; the men had
chatted briefly during a casual meeting at the airport.
Panofsky was called before the committee, where
he immediately denied Packard's report. "To clarify
the record," he began, "I would like to state that I

did not participate in any advisory capacity to any
branch of the government in reviewing the decision to
deploy the current modified Sentinel or Safeguard
system." He went on to criticize the Nixon ABM
proposal, stating, "There can no longer be any
question that the ABM has escalated and will
continue to escalate the arms race."
What is the basis for his concern? Speaking before
a number of groups in the Stanford area, he has
pointed out the costs of weapons development. "The
total income of those people living in the
underdeveloped part of the world in Latin America,
the Middle East, and Southern Asia is less than the
outlay of the world for military purposes . . . The
world's stockpile of nuclear weapons amounts to
more than ten tons' equivalent of TNT for every man,
woman, and child on the globe."
Survival of Civilization
Yet cost is not his most salient objection to the
arms race. Rather, he calls the arms race "the threat
of a war so destructive as to endanger the very
survival of civilization ..."
Reading a meticulously worded speech to his
audiences, Panofsky carefully explains some
fundamental causes of the arms race. He points out
that both American and Russian strategic policies
tend to be ambiguous, striving to both deter nuclear
war and to maintain the ability to "limit damage"
and to "fight a war and prevail " should deterence

HIGH ENERGY PHYSlCS—Wolfgang Panofsky, head of Stanford's Linear
Accelerator (SLAC), is described by friends as like the subnuclear particles he
studies ■ full of energy. Whether it's before Poli, Sci, 138 a or the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, he offers authoritative views on subjects ranging from high
energy physics to nuclear disarmament.
fail. He notes that the two strategic objectives of
deterrence and damage limitation, if adopted by the
Soviet Union and the United States, effectively
countermand one another. If the U.S. increases its
damage-limiting capability, the Russians may begin to
fear that the U.S. is preparing for a first strike attack
against Russia. They will increase their armaments,
thus evoking similar fears in the U.S. Thus the arms
race will continue.
For this reason, he generally opposes construction
of damage-limitation devices - those types of ABM
systems, MIRVs (independently guided multiple
warheads) or Civil Defense systems which could be
seen as a threat by the Russians.
Panofsky strongly objects to the argument that an
ABM system is needed to block a possible Chinese
nuclear attack. He sees the ABM development as a
power play with regard to Asian policy designed to
permit us to "threaten the use of nuclear weapons in
S.E. Asia without risking the lives of people in L.A."
He feels this is a "dubious justification" for the ABM.
"I think it's immoral to be in a position to threaten
to make war with impunity."
Communications Gap
Panofsky tries to prevent such escalation by
communicating his analysis of the subject to policy
makers. Realizing that "science is a very important
component of decision-making" and that many
politicians are "technologically illiterate," he sees a
dilemma in our decision-making process - either
scientists must "stick their necks out beyond the
range of their competence," or decision makers must
know more about the implications of science to
public policy.
"The future may depend on the ability of
administrators to understand the importance of
science without being scientists ... An arms control
constituency is needed," he remarked. The nuclear
expert would certainly be an influential figure in any

arms control constituency. While staying within his
field of competence, he tries to slow the arms race by
helping citizens and decision makers learn more about
the problems and implications of the strategic arms
race.
Panofsky is also an expert on research processes.
Although administrative duties now leave him little
time for his own research, he undertook a broad
spectrum of projects during his years as a professor at
the University of California and at Stanford. A
number of the experiments, devices and techniques
he developed are now classic in the field of particle
physics.
The high-energy physics research done at SLAC is
probably about the purest research done at Stanford.
It is so devoid of possible military applications that
Russian scientists are permitted to visit SLAC
facilities, while SLAC personnel work at a similar
installation in Russia.
'Help Others Learn'
Panofsky's goal in regard to SLAC research is
similar to his goal in the area of armaments - to help
others learn. He is responsible for providing facilities
that allow researchers to carry out advanced projects
at SLAC.
Though opposing classified research or projects
relating directly to development of military systems,
Panofsky believes university researchers must have a
relative degree of freedom in their research, so that
initiative for research will be preserved.
In a speech last year, he stated "It is the essence of
freedom that if we wish to preserve individual
initiative then some things will be going on which
some of us might not like, yet constraining it too
much will make all of us losers in the long run." Why
losers? Because, he explains, "Society's problems of
pollution, overpopulation, maintaining peace, and the
like will all require technology for their solution."

Panofsky believes that governmental
decision-makers bear the responsibility for controlling
possible harmful applications of technology. "There
are a number of steps between technology and
military applications," he explains. "The chain
extends over many years and is governed by political
processes ... I see no valid excuse why we should
acquiesce in the development of weapons of
ever-increasing lethality." Again, Panofsky assumes
the role of informing decision makers about the
implications of scientific developments within the
range of his experience. Hopefully, they'll listen.
The Administrator
Panofsky is also a highly competent administrator,
much respected by SLAC personnel. "Most of my
scientific work is involved in making choices between
alternate opportunities. There are simply more
proposals than can be handled." His competence as
SLAC Director has attracted the interest of an MIT
committee which is now considering him as a possible
candidate for the presidency of that university.
The SLAC director applies his administrative
prowess while expressing his concern for those
working under him. "I was particularly impressed by
his explicitly refraining from firing people during the
recent budgetary crisis," commented one SLAC
employee. "Instead of laying people off, he shortened
each person's work month by a day, and postponed
salary increases in the higher brackets. You get the
impression he really cares about the people who work
for him."
Panofsky does care about people. While pursuing
knowledge to explain the nature of matter; he finds
time to express his understanding of problems
"within the range of his competence". Though
careful to speak only on subjects on which he is an
expert Panofsky's expertise is broad enough to make
him quite influential if people will listen.
