# Voyeurs Visit Showers
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
A girl taking a shower in Toyon
looks up to see a pair of dark glasses
under a white canvas hat peeping
around the corner.
A man crawls into a second floor
bathroom in Wilbur and asks an amazed
girl, "Oh, is this the girl's bathroom?"
He crawls out and repeats his
performance later that night.
An increase in incidents like these
prompted Toyon girls to request locks
on their shower rooms this month.
Locks will be installed on the girls'
bathrooms in most of the Wilbur
houses within a week.
"We couldn't think of anything else
to do," explains Marie Haley, Wilbur
director. At lease eight incidents have
occurred in Toyon in recent months:
five or six in Wilbur.
"The girls in one house asked for a
lock and its cheaper to do all the
bathrooms at once, if the house wants
it," she said. Wilbur bathrooms include
toilets and sinks as well as showers.
Key No Hassle
Toyon girls seem content with the
new arrangement. The shower room is
separate and most girls carry a room
key anyhow, so an extra key is not a
major hassle. Wilbur girls are
ambivalent about the new locks and in
several houses they did not know they
have any choice in the matter.
"It's scary, but I don't see how you
can lock a bathroom, a public facility. I
don't know if it's an answer,"
commented one victim of a peeping
torn.
The general consensus is that the

locks will be a pain in various portions
of the anatomy. But one house voted
to request a lock after several incidents
occurred.
"It's too bad, but it's necessary," a
girl said. "You're nervous for awhile
and then you forget all about it and
them something happens again."
Despite wild rumors, no girls have
been attacked this year, at least, not in
the showers. So far, the intruders leave
as soon as they are noticed, although
few girls scream or make any fuss.
There is no obvious pattern to the
incidents. Many different men have
.been described: elderly, middle-aged,
twentiesh, teens; tall and good-looking
to short and stocky; usually Caucasian,
sometimes Black. The strangers
generally drop by at reasonable hours,
from 10 a.m. to 11 p.m. on all days of
the week.
Peepers Multiply
The incidents are definitely on the rise
this year. Only one or two peepers were
reported in Toyon last year; they are a
new phenomenon in Wilbur, once
all-male.
Girls seem calm about the whole
thing. "It's not scary; it's kind of
ridiculous," a Toyon two-timer said.
"It seems to happen to people who
don't get upset about things like that,"
she added.
"I guess I should have been scared,
but I felt very calm at the time,"
observed a Wilbur girl who found two
teen-age boys staring at her through the
shower curtains one evening.
"I just feel sorry for people who
have to do that," a Toyon girl said.
