# Protesters Face Felony; Oakland 12 Found Guilty
## 
### FRED MANN 
Thirteen Stanford students arrested
in a peaceful anti-war protest in San
Francisco Tuesday were charged with
felony counts of violating the 196 7
Selective Service Act yesterday
afternoon in the city.
The seven women and six men, 10 of
them from the non-violent co-operative
Columbae House, were accused of
interference with the operation of the
Selective Service System, the same
charge usually lodged against draft
resisters. Maximum penalty for the
offense is $1 0,000 and/or five years in
prison.
It is believed to be the first time
women have ever been charged with
violating the Selective Service Act.
Meanwhile, 12 persons being held in
Oakland for a similar demonstration at
the Army Induction Center were found
guilty of obstructing a public sidewalk
or place, and sentenced to 90 days with
85 suspended in Santa Rita Prison.
They were also placed on one year
probation. Nine of the 1 2 are Stanford
students.
The eight men will begin serving
their sentences tomorrow, and the four
women on Wednesday.
Hearing March 19
The 13 in San Francisco were
arraigned before a federal magistrate at
1 :30 p.m. at the Federal Building, 45 0
Golden Gate, and were informed of the
charges. Each was assigned a lawyer,
and a hearing was set for March 1 9 at
2:30 p.m. The defendents were not
required to enter a plea.
After the courtroom meeting with
the magistrate, the students were
released on their own recognizance.
The group successfully closed down
entrance to the Selective Service office
for two hours Tuesday before
submitting to arrest by San Francisco

city police, on the instruction of
federal agents.
Other anti-war protesters staged like
demonstrations in Oakland, San Jose
(where five people were arrested), San
Mateo, and Berkeley. No arrests
occurred in Berkeley or in San Mateo
where faculty, clergy, and Stanford
community people demonstrated for
three days without response from the
police.
Locals Won't Touch
Federal charges were issued against
the 13 in San Francisco presumably
because no misdemeanor count could
be applied in the situation. State and
local officials refused to prosecute
calling it "entirely a Federal matter."
A Federal misdemeanor for illegal
assembly does exist, but can not be
applied in this case because the building
housing the Selective Service offices is
not Federal property. It is rented.
During their transfer from city jail to
the Federal Building at 11 :00 a.m., the
women were handcuffed, and the men
were shackled with handcuffs linked to
iron bands around their waists, and leg
irons. All remained in good spirits, and
sang while awaiting arraignment.
San Francisco lawyer Harry C. Singer
will be head counsel for the defendants.
He and the 12 other draft lawyers were
described by one defendant as "very
excited about handling the case."
The 13 were instructed not to leave
the Northern California area before the
March 19 hearing without special
permission. A Grand Jury meeting has
been scheduled for Wednesday, and in
the event the group returns indictments
against the protesters, the 13 will go to
trial on a date set by the jury,
superceeding the scheduled hearing.
Special Problems
At least two of those arrested in San
Francisco, Sue Block, 19, a junior in

pre-med, and Craig Schindler, 24, a
second-year law student, face added
pressures from the felony charges. A
moral terpitude clause applies to
anyone convicted of a felony who is
planning to practice medicine or law.
He or she must be "morally fit" in the
eyes of examining boards in order to
obtain a license.
"We thought about this problem
before we went," said Block. "I think it
will work out. If it doesn't, I don't
know if I'll want to practice medicine
in that kind of a system that doesn't
recognize any moral commitment."
Many of those arrested called their
24-hours in jail "an incredible learning
experience." They viewed the use of
handcuffs and leg irons as "acts of
intimidation," but, said Block, "We all
felt more honest and pure and clean
and happy than ever in our lives."
A spokesman at Columbae House
said spirits there were "very high, very
together," and said future actions were
being planned although he declined to
elaborate.
