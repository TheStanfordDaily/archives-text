# Fraternities Look For New Image
## 
### JIM ALMAS COMMENTARY 
The annual search for warm bodies, Stanford's fraternity
rush, is in its second of six weeks. But this year the format
is more relaxed, the approach more cautious, and the
philosophy of the participants more positive.
The "Rush Book" is testimony to those changing
attitudes. This year the book cost the interfraternity
council $85 0 less than last year's. Gone with the high cost,
according to Chris Redlich, the "Rush Book" chairman, is
the gloss and artificiality of last year's publication.
While the "Rush Book" does contain a certain amount of
"cow excrement," poetry, and scripture, its purpose is to
present a general overview of Stanford fraternities.
Fraternities at Stanford have been fighting an uphill
battle. As one of the contributors to the rush booklet
states, "Fraternities have been fighting a battle against their
images. No fraternity has failed to feel the impact of
self-inspection." While many fraternities take a defensive
posture and nearly all stress the diversity of their
membership, some frats seem to be uneffected by their
'self-inspection.' Last Friday "pledges" of the Phi Delt
house, dressed in gunnysacks, threw their fully-clothed
"aÂ«tives" into the fountain in White Plaza.
'Small Groups Popular'
John Grube, a former ASSU hydra-head and now the
Director of Fraternities in the Dean of Student's Office,
speaks of the positive nature of the fraternity system.
"Small group living situations have traditionally been
popular," he states, "and the fraternities at Stanford have
essentially become cooperatives, which are very popular
today. They offer an opportunity for independent and
usually lower cost financing."

The evolution of fraternities, as viewed from the inside,
is also very revealing. Redefinition has eliminated much of
the ritual and heraldry that characterized fraternities.
Selection policies have drastically transformed: Now it's
harder to get into certain University houses than it is to get
into most fraternities.
Questions to Pose
But there are some facts that the freshman will only
obtain from asking the individual fraternities. Some
questions a freshman might pose are:
Who does the house work (i.e. maintenance, phone duty,
etc.)? In many houses this work is done exclusively bv
sophomores.
Does the house have "pledge" projects, done only by its
newest members?
What kinds of initiation and/or hell week are still
practiced?
What kind of selection process is there?
Are the low bills that the house advertises honest? They
may be deceptively low because the house doesn't serve
meals on weekends or portions of weekends.
What is the house's financial status? Will the members
next year have to pay back this year's debts?
While it is true that these are little things in relation to
the totality of the living situation, the little things are often
what makes a living situation worthwhile. Few places on
the Stanford campus can claim that a 'ride to the airport is
always available.' Many fraternities can make that claim. If
a freshman has an open and inquisitive mind, he can
discover that campus fraternities are a viable living
alternative.
