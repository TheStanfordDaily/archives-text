# Injunction Hearing Continues
## Defense Challenges Original TRO 
### SCOTT THACHER RALPH KOSTANT 
At the second day of hearings on
Stanford's request for a preliminary
injunction against sixteen named
individuals, defense lawyers argued
yesterday that the hearing itself was
invalid.
Attorney Norton Tooby challenged
the hearing on the ground that the

original Temporary Restraining Order
(TRO), still in effect, had been
improperly obtained. No attempt had
been made to notify the defendants in
advance, he said, and added that 12 of
the 22 affidavits used to obtain the
order were defective and did not
constitute proper evidence.
The University's lawyer, David
Heilbron, replied that even if the TRO
had been defective, it was not needed
for the show cause hearing presently
taking place. A "show cause" hearing is
for the purpose of allowing the named
defendants to argue why the injunction
should not be granted, Heilbron argued.
TRO Invalid?
Defense attorneys claimed that
failure to include the date or place of
execution on the affidavits invalidated
the court order, namely the TRO
stemming from them. They also held
that statements in the affidavits such
as, "this person, who was later
identified to me as . . . " constituted
hearsay.
Assistant to the President .John
Schwartz was called to the witness
stand to explain how different signers
of the affidavits identified defendants
from photographs which he showed
them.
Superior Court Judge Richard
Rhodes ruled that only two of five
objectionable affidavits included
hearsay. When the hearing reconvenes
today at 1 0 a.m. he must still decide
whether the TRO is invalid, if it
appears to him the question is relevant
to the hearing.
Tooby asserted that between the
time of the events of February 1 0 and
the issuance of the TRO two days later,
none of the defendants had been
warned of the impending action by the
University.
"They have tried to crush a
movement," replied Tooby, "without
notifying the defendants."

The hearing also covered what effect
the injunction would have. Professor
Charles Drekmeier one of the group of
55 faculty petitioners to intervene in
the hearing, took the witness stand. He
said the injunction gave the University
too great discretionary power over
campus political activities. "It has acted
and will act as a repressive force."
During the afternoon session of the
court, Heilbron defended the
University's position that the
injunction "does not have the intention
of banning peaceful demonstrations."
He appealed to the court to
recognize "the distinction between free
speech and destructive acts." He
claimed that when defendant Janet
Weiss, for example spoke of shutting
down the University, she had in mind
more than boycotting classes as
evidenced by her "going in, and milling
around inside the computer center."
He went on to describe the import of
provisions 3 and 4 of the injunction,
which in part prohibit the disruption of
classes and the obstruction by sit-ins of
entrances to buildings on the academic
campus.
They are identical to provisions in
the injunction obtained two years ago.
"One does not have the right to speak
whenever and wherever he wants." said

Heilbron, "but only at the proper time
and place."
Shootings And Beatings
Referring to such events as "the
gagging by noise" of Henry Cabot
Lodge during his attempted speech last
January, and the shootings and beatings
that occurred the night of February 10,
he said, "The University has had
enough of this kind of action and it
wants to restrain it with a clear
injunction."
Defendant Bruce Franklin, who is
representing himself in court, claimed
that "they (the University) are using
the injunction to keep me from a fair
hearing" before the Faculty Advisory
Board, which will arbitrate President
Lyman's charge that Franklin be fired.
Before 5 :00 p.m. yesterday Franklin
was supposed to have decided whether
he wanted his case to appear before the
board or be left to Lyman's discretion.
Lyman has asked for Franklin's
dismissal.
Instead, Franklin has sent a letter to
James Sienna, legal adviser to the
president, saying that he cannot make
"a rational decision" until the
injunction hearings are over.
He feels that the eighth provision of
the injunction, which would permit
him to come on campus only to collect
evidence for his case.
