Editor, THE DAILY:
Tuesday's Daily has a
statement by Associate Provost
Rosenzweig that, "No teaching
or scholarship flourished at the
computation center on Feb.
10." This is incorrect. I
normally hold office hours for
C S 12 5 on Monday,
Wednesday, Friday from 1:00
to 3:00 p.m.
On Feb. 10 I met with
students ill the course both in
my office in Polya hall, and
after the doors of Polya were
locked, in the vicinity of Pine
hall. In fact, more students
came to consult about the
course on Feb. 10 than on any

other day this quarter, so that
if they had any bearing, the
events of that day enhanced
my teaching activities.

stop the reds!
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been reading your
column printed in the Campus

Viewpoint which is part of the
Sacramento Bee.
All of your viewpoints are
critical of the U.S. Why do
you not criticize the Reds?
Remember, if the Reds take
over this country, your school
will be run by the government.
No more dissents, no burning
of school nothing-no freedom
of press or speech- is this what
you want?
The U.S. is fighting to
prevent the spread of
Communism. Why do you
resent this?
Your paper never says
anything against the Reds.
Would you like to live under
Red tyranny?
The Reds are going to
spread their ideology of slavery
until stopped by a greater
force. If we don't stop them

in Vietnam, we shall have to
stop them elsewhere. The U.S.
must not leave the people of
Southeast Asia to the mercies
of the Reds. The Reds have no
mercy.

I support the women's lib
right-on charge that the $7.50 Pap
smear fee at Cowell is sexist. In
order to promote equality of the
sexes, I offer to give $3.75 to any
Stanford girl who will sleep with
me.
