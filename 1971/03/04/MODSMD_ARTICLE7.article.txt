# Library Workers' Statement
## 
### 
Mr. John Keilch, a member
of the Stanford University
Libraries staff, has been
suspended for three months for
his part in the alleged
disruption of Henry Cabot
Lodge's speech on January 11,
1971. We, the undersigned
library staff members, demand
that the charges against Mr.
Keilch be dropped and that his
suspension and probation be
rescinded. We have several
reasons, some concerning the
very nature of the charges,
others with the procedures
taken and decisions made in
regard to the charges, for
making this demand and for
addressing it to you.
Let us speak first of the
nature of the charges made
against Mr. Keilch. He has been
suspended for three months, an
action which in effect fines
him $1 ,35 6.00 , and placed on
a year's probation for having
expressed his political views by
heckling a politician and
protesting that politician's role
in the war in Indochina.
A recent decision was
handed down by the California
Supreme Court concerning a
group of farmworkers who
were taken to court for
heckling Senator John Tunney
and preventing him from
speaking at a public gathering.
The Supreme Court found, by
a decision of 8 to 1, that
heckling a politician is perfectly
acceptable behavior under the
Ist Amendament; indeed, the
Court pointed out that such
behavior is one of the few
forms of legitimate expression
of their views available to

many people. In the light of
this decision and with its
obvious applicability to Mr.
Keilch's behavior, our demands
are reasonable and compelling.
...The grievance committee
which has been hearing Mr.
Keilch's case for the past two
weeks, consists of three
persons. One is a representative
of your (President Lyman)
office, the office which, in the
person of your Special
Assistant Mr. John Schwartz,
brought the charges against
John Keilch. Another is the
representative of Mr. David
Weber, Director of Libraries,
who made the decision to
suspend Mr. Keilch, a decision
made, according to his own
testimony, without investigating
the evidence. The third member
of the committee is Mr.
Keilch's representative. This
composition stacks the
committee two to one in favor
of those who decided upon Mr.
Keilch's guilt, accepted it
without question, and imposed
the penalties.
The evidence and testimony
which has been presented
before this committee has
exposed the flimsy and
unstable basis of the
administration's case and has
revealed the extraordinarily
arbitrary nature of the steps
taken against John Keilch.
Your Special Assistant John
Schwartz acted upon this case
and found Mr. Keilch in
violation of the campus
disruption policy before he had
even obtained written

statements from those who
claimed to have seen him
heckling Mr. Henry Cabot
Lodge. Upon discovering that
Mr. Keilch was not a student,
but rather an employee, Mr.
Schwartz wrote a memo to Mr.
Weber stating his conclusion
that the campus disruption
policy had been violated by
Mr. Keilch.
Mr. Weber, by his own
admission, accepted this
judgment without question. He
did not ask to see or hear the
evidence. He suspended Mr.
Keilch and placed him on a
year's probation. This action
has been justified under the
"unacceptable behavior" clause
in University Guide Memo
22 yet both Mr. Schwartz
and Mr. Weber have denied
responsibility for deciding to
apply this clause to the case.
Mr. Schwartz, in his testimony
before the grievance committee,
said that his statement that Mr.
Keilch was subject to
disciplinary action was simply a
"prosecutor's judgment" and
that he had not necessarily
expected the Director of
Libraries to take action upon
it.
Both Mr. Robert Nelson and
Mr. Schwartz have testified
before the committee that they
have kept you informed of the
case. Next to the Board of
Trustees, you are the ultimate
authority in the university. We
believe that you must take
some responsibility for the
actions of your administrators
toward Mr. Keilch, particularly
in view of the fact that you
said in your KZSU broadcast
on Jan. 12 th that evidence was
being collected against the
Lodge protesters and that
prosecution would follow.
Many of those who work at
Stanford feel that, in light of
the events we have described,
we must insist upon our right
to effective representation in
policy making bodies such as
that which drafted the campus
disruption policy. We also insist
that the administration
recognize its responsibilities
toward university workers.
It is for all these reasons,
President Lyman, that we make
our demands.
