Hogwash, the top-seeded team,
was eliminated from the
Intramural League playoffs in the
biggest upset of the tournaments
so far. Two other seeded teams,
the fifth-ranked Zetes and the
seventh-ranked Hecky ell's Boys,
were also knocked out as the
playoffs reached the final six
teams.
Hogwash was beaten by the
perenially strong Delts 4 5 -42 in a
quarter-final game played Monday
night. Paced by the early scoring
of Guy Smythe and Manuel
Karlin, Hogwash bolted to a 27-20
halftime lead, but the
sixth-ranked Delts rallied in the
second half to win it. The victors
were led by Brian Hewitt's 15
points.

Unseeded Forthoffer 5
surprised the fifth-seeded Zetes in
a game played Sunday. Grabbing
an 18-1 0 halftime lead, Forthoffer
was able to continue its
domination in the second half and
finish with a 4 2-32 victory. Dave
Bonelli and Ken Pisciotto were
the leading scorers for the
winners, finishing with 14 and 11
points respectively.
Heckyell's Boys lost as
expected to third-seeded KA, last
year's champions, 5 6-36. KA also
defeated high-scoring Z, 4 6-34,
utilizing the balanced scoring of
Bruce Menser, Stan Bakun, and
Bob Evers, each with 10 points, to
offset the 14 point performance
of the loser's Jackie Brown.
In other important games,
fourth-seeded Nickle Bag was hard

pressed to overcome the unseeded
Rooters, 5 4 -43 on Thursday
night. Playing much of the time
with only five men, one of whom
had four fouls, the Rooters clung
gamely to Nickle Bag, who were
able to clinch victory only in the
final minutes. Doug Baldwin with
16, .Jay Hoff with 15, and Mar!c
Hanson with 12 points paced the
winners. Kappa Sigma,
second-ranked and now the team
most likely to win it all, routed
the Hulks, 69-28 on Thursday
night.
