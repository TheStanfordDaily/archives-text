—a lecture series designed to present to students, faculty,
and staff members the facts of Stanford. The development
of this institution is a phenomenon not easily understood
I /by those who do not daily confront the problems associ
ated with deciding which road the university should take
into the future. As a participant in the evolution of this uni
versity and as an integral part of this community you
should know what lies behind the walls of sandstone.
Come to the Dinkelspiel Auditorium Thursday afternoon,
March 1 Ith, 4:00 p.m. We think you should care enough
about Stanford University to at least learn something
about it.
