Pardon us for name dropping, but we think it's worth shouting about
when three of the country's hottest artists are about to drop in on Stan-
We think it's especially important that you know about it because it is
YOUR concert and we want you, the Stanford Student body, to have
the best seats in the house.
But to do that, you're going to have to buy your discounted tickets
early - before the rest of the Laura Nyro, Sha-na-na and Chicago fans
get the word.
Tickets go on sale today at Tresidder. Buy them now, or watch for our
table at Registration. We'd like to be able to drop some more names on
you before spring ends.
