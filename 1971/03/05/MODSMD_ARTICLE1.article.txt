# Faculty Senate Condemns Laos Invasion, Viet War
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Faculty Senate yesterday called
"with a new intensity" for the
President of the U.S. and Congress to
"take immediate steps to bring our
involvement" in the war in Southeast
Asia to a speedy and complete end."
Their resolution was in response to
the recent allied invasion of Laos.The
resolution, which passed 22 to 9 with
eight members abstaining in a roll-call
vote, declares that "the entry into Laos
has left many students, faculty, and
staff profoundly discouraged about the
likelihood of influencing the
government through normal
procedures. That feeling of hoplessness
is no less threatening to the life of the
university than was last spring's intense
anger over Cambodia."
The Senate action came shortly after
it had passed by a divided voice vote a
motion declaring it "inappropriate" for
the Senate "to take positions as a body
on the matters not directly related to
the proper functioning of the
University."
The resolution on Laos as passed by
the Senate during its three-hour
meeting "addresses itself to the
incursion into Laos because of the
profoundly damaging effects which
that action is having on the life and
work of this University."
Mail Ballot Possible
There were indications that there
would be an attempt to present the
resolution by mail ballot to the entire
Academic Council (faculty members of
a rank of assistant professor and higher,
including certain administrators) for
approval or disapproval. The Senate,
composed of slightly more than 5 0
voting members, takes action for the
larger Academic Council. The Council
can approve or disapprove actions of
the Senate provided at least one-third
of the members of the Senate or 50

members of the Council file a petition
asking the Council to review the
decision.
Last spring the Senate adopted a
similar resolution condemning the war
in Southeast Asia and our entrance into
Cambodia because of the tragic results
it had on the University. Yesterday's
action came after much debate over the
political nature of the motion and
whether it was appropriate for the
Senate as a corporate body to make a
statement on political issues of any
kind—even if the issues have some
effect on the University.
Corporate Statement
The resolution distinguishes
"between two kinds of possible actions
by the Senate: (1) making a corporate
statement on political issues in
general"-which the Senate
rejected—and "(2) making such a
corporate statement about a national
and international issue which has direct
and 'devastating repercussions' on the
University itself." TTie Senate approved
the latter idea by passing the Laos
resolution.
The resolution notes that "the entry
into Laos has left many members of the
University community in serious doubt
about our government's repeated
assertions that it seeks a political
solution to the war in Southeast Asia.
The official justifications of the
action ... further erode trust in the
words of those who held public office,"
with the result of "a growing cynicism
about the worth of honesty that strikes
at the heart of the University's values."
The entry into Laos, the resolution
continues, "breeds apathy with respect
to the democratic processes" in some
members of the University community.
"Others it tempts to violence. In most
it jeopardizes that confidence in
rationality necessary to the University's
functioning."

k It concluded, "We the Senate of the
Academic Council of Stanford
University, share the doubts and
discouragement of other members of
the University community. But we
reaffirm our determination of last
spring to join with them in the search
for Constitutional and effective means
to influence our government."
In other action yesterday, the Senate
approved a policy statement on
Undergraduate Special Courses of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
The policy outlines the roles of
sponsors and instructors in
undergraduate special courses, their
qualifications, and enrollment
limitations on a number of these
courses.
James Gibbs Jr., dean of
Undergraduate Studies, noted in an
accompanying letter that last year over
3,5 0 0 students were enrolled in the 117
special courses.
Redirecting Engineering
In remarks to the Senate, Joseph
Petit, dean of the School of
Engineering, denounced "too much
political talk about redirecting
engineering into 'socially useful
projects' ... The nation seems not
ready to spend real money on these
matters—even to use available man
power and known technology," Petit
said.
He noted that although the job
market for engineers across the nation
is not very good, 95 percent of all
engineers are employed.
Petit partially explained the asking
of federal monies for engineering
research. "We ask for funds to do what
we want to do," he said. "I am
continually astonished when students
or faculty think that all of this is 'doing
engineering for hire'—to produce a
specific weapon or something."

and international issue which has direct
and 'devastating repercussions' on the
University itself." TTie Senate approved
the latter idea by passing the Laos
resolution.
The resolution notes that "the entry
into Laos has left many members of the
University community in serious doubt
about our government's repeated
assertions that it seeks a political
solution to the war in Southeast Asia.
The official justifications of the
action ... further erode trust in the
words of those who held public office,"
with the result of "a growing cynicism
about the worth of honesty that strikes
at the heart of the University's values."
The entry into Laos, the resolution
continues, "breeds apathy with respect
to the democratic processes" in some
members of the University community.
"Others it tempts to violence. In most
it jeopardizes that confidence in
rationality necessary to the University's
functioning."

k It concluded, "We the Senate of the
Academic Council of Stanford
University, share the doubts and
discouragement of other members of
the University community. But we
reaffirm our determination of last
spring to join with them in the search
for Constitutional and effective means
to influence our government."
In other action yesterday, the Senate
approved a policy statement on
Undergraduate Special Courses of the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies.
The policy outlines the roles of
sponsors and instructors in
undergraduate special courses, their
qualifications, and enrollment
limitations on a number of these
courses.
James Gibbs Jr., dean of
Undergraduate Studies, noted in an
accompanying letter that last year over
3,5 0 0 students were enrolled in the 117
special courses.
Redirecting Engineering
In remarks to the Senate, Joseph
Petit, dean of the School of
Engineering, denounced "too much
political talk about redirecting
engineering into 'socially useful
projects' ... The nation seems not
ready to spend real money on these
matters—even to use available man
power and known technology," Petit
said.
He noted that although the job
market for engineers across the nation
is not very good, 95 percent of all
engineers are employed.
Petit partially explained the asking
of federal monies for engineering
research. "We ask for funds to do what
we want to do," he said. "I am
continually astonished when students
or faculty think that all of this is 'doing
engineering for hire'—to produce a
specific weapon or something."

COURTROOM CLASH—lnjunction Defendant Jane Franklin, wife of suspended English Professor Bruce Franklin, seems to
be having difficulty entering the courtroom. The injunction hearing is being held in Superior Court No. 2 in Palo Alto.
The Faculty Senate yesterday called
"with a new intensity" for the
President of the U.S. and Congress to
"take immediate steps to bring our
involvement" in the war in Southeast
Asia to a speedy and complete end."
Their resolution was in response to
the recent allied invasion of Laos.The
resolution, which passed 22 to 9 with
eight members abstaining in a roll-call
vote, declares that "the entry into Laos
has left many students, faculty, and
staff profoundly discouraged about the
likelihood of influencing the
government through normal
procedures. That feeling of hoplessness
is no less threatening to the life of the
university than was last spring's intense
anger over Cambodia."
The Senate action came shortly after
it had passed by a divided voice vote a
motion declaring it "inappropriate" for
the Senate "to take positions as a body
on the matters not directly related to
the proper functioning of the
University."
The resolution on Laos as passed by
the Senate during its three-hour
meeting "addresses itself to the
incursion into Laos because of the
profoundly damaging effects which
that action is having on the life and
work of this University."
Mail Ballot Possible
There were indications that there
would be an attempt to present the
resolution by mail ballot to the entire
Academic Council (faculty members of
a rank of assistant professor and higher,
including certain administrators) for
approval or disapproval. The Senate,
composed of slightly more than 5 0
voting members, takes action for the
larger Academic Council. The Council
can approve or disapprove actions of
the Senate provided at least one-third
of the members of the Senate or 50

members of the Council file a petition
asking the Council to review the
decision.
Last spring the Senate adopted a
similar resolution condemning the war
in Southeast Asia and our entrance into
Cambodia because of the tragic results
it had on the University. Yesterday's
action came after much debate over the
political nature of the motion and
whether it was appropriate for the
Senate as a corporate body to make a
statement on political issues of any
kind—even if the issues have some
effect on the University.
Corporate Statement
The resolution distinguishes
"between two kinds of possible actions
by the Senate: (1) making a corporate
statement on political issues in
general"-which the Senate
rejected—and "(2) making such a
corporate statement about a national
and international issue which has direct
and 'devastating repercussions' on the
University itself." TTie Senate approved
