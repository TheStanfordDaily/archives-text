# Urban Pollution Study
## 
### 
A special program which will
provide students with an
opportunity to study the problem
of urban pollution in their own
home towns during the summer
for academic credit has been
established by three campus
organizations.
SWOPSI, SCIRE, and Urban
Studies are jointly sponsoring the
project entitled "An Attack on
Urban Pollution" and are
currently taking sign-ups. The aim
of the program is to take Stanford
to the community, with students
doing real life research on the
problems of pollution in scattered
communities across the
country. Different aspects of
the pollution crisis will be dealt
with by the three organizations
through workshops, research
teams, and internships. A
preparatory workshop will be
offered next quarter, with
summer projects in cities
throughout the country following.
Next fall, a correlation and
evaluation seminar will round out
the project.
Credit will be divided with five
units given to the spring course
and five to the fall seminar.
Actual work expectancy however
will be: three units worth during
the spring, five during the
summer, and two in the fall.
Directors of the project Nick
Corff (SWOPSI), Lana DeSalvo
(SCIRE) and Roy Childs (Urban
Studies) envision the program as
"an opportunity for concerned
Stanford students to do
something valuable with their
summer in addition to their jobs."
Benefits to the communities
studied by the students may
include the compilation of
material and information on local
pollution problems, the

presentation of both the problems
and possible solutions to the
appropriate agencies or mass
media, and the establishment of a
core of local people who will
carry on the research and problem
solving.
Each of the three organizations
will provide their own individual
approach to the project, in
keeping with the separate
functions of SWOPSI, SCIRE, and
Urban Studies.
