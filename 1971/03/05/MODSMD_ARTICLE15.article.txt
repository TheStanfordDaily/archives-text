# Drama Experiments Slated To Liven Dead Week
## 'Dream' Explores Formlessness Overwritten 'Lightning At Funeral' Unique 'Macbeth' Adaptation 
### STU ALLEN TERRIE McDONALD STEVEN UNGAR 
An experiment tests a hypothesis to determine its concordance
with reality, as we judge it. Beckey Daniel's "Recurring Dream no.
16" is an experimental work that alters the form of musical drama in
an attempt to create a fresh approach to the question of young people
in love.
As an experiment, the show is not entirely successful. To further
inundate the audience with the sensuality of the emotional conflicts,
there is a continuous barrage of rock and softer, quieter music, of
blinking lights, and of slides and movies projected on four walls.
The result is, at times, a formless production that is neither a show
nor life, as we know it. It is a completely valid experiment to explore
this gray area of the theater, however, and "Recurring Dream" cannot
be faulted for being unlike most stage experiences.
'Disconnected Images'
Unfortunately, at times the show does not integrate all that is
happening in the theater. If one searches hard, very hard, a
justification can perhaps be found for all the slides, the set, or the
dancing when it seems unrelated. The audience's response mirroring
the "disconnected images" that run through the players' minds is very
nearly boredom.
Happily boredom never really sets in. The cast directed by Richard
Carp, has become very close in the past two months and it shows. The
warmth of the cast in reaching to and holding each other creates an
excitement that infuses the Nitery at the peak moments when the
audience's attention is allowed to focus on the performers as persons.
That excitement bubbles over at several points, spreading to find
that spirit of commonality that unites us all when we have the
moments to let it.
Examine Walls
If you are willing to spend an hour or so re-examining the walls that
we build between each other so that we can get along with one
another, you are likely to find "Recurring Dream no. 16" an exciting
experiment.
The form, or more nearly formless spontaneity, of this show is
saved from chaos by the infusion of humanness provided by the cast.
The Ram's Head production will be performed on March 7 and 11
at 8:00 p.m. and March 5, 6, 12 and 13 at 7:30 and 9:30 p.m.
Admission is $1.

how long shall the wicked exult?
They pour out their arrogant words
they boast, all the evil doers.
They crush thy people, O, Lord,
and afflict thy heritage.
They slay the widow and the sojourner,
and murder the fatherless,
and they say, "the Lord does not see
the God of Jacob does not perceiue. "
Psalm 94
Replete with hinted cannibalism, cliches and a
cast of rather obtusely Biblical characters, David
Pinner's "Lightening at a Funeral" aspires after a
universality that will make credible its location,
"anywhere war is," and time, "now." It succeeds
in presenting a horror show consisting of the
distilled essences of "The Boston Strangler," Nazi
Germany, "Two Women" and "Combat!"
The play's cohesive force is a dubious priest
figure who resists the embarrassingly self-debasing
seduction attempts of an unmarried
nymphomaniac, but who later encourages this
woman's daughter to complete a frenzied
strip-tease. (She never makes it.) Sharing the stage
with madly gesticulating, impassioned
personalities, the portrayal of the priest is
necessarily low-keyed, but unnecessarily
undermined by comments intended to provide the
audience with some new generalizations about the
clergy such as, "You're not a man - you're
something in between," and the
too-often-reiterated-to-be-subtle comment that he,
his hand, his cheek, etc., are "cold" or "dead."
Cast Does Well
The weaknesses apparent in the play are rarely
attributable to the cast. Stanford Drama
Department members generally maintain
continuity of character inspite of the somewhat
erratic behavior required of them.
Peter Silbert as Jacob and Cecily Morgan as his
wife, Hanna, give outstanding performances as the
wizened old parents of Bridget Ross' Rachel, the
seductress. They are a perversely proud couple,
scarcely able to walk unaided, yet they resist all
assistance. Their sadistic treatment of one another,
derisive commentary on the events taking place in
the rather impressively bombed-out church and

their recounting of the hardships and gratifications
of life on the ranch slip in and out of grotesque
"satry iconese."
If their part in this play of Ã¼biquitous messages
is old age's impassivity toward death and
unconcern for the living, their performances and
appearances are remarkably credible.
Unanswered Questions
Pinner raises questions of some impressive
consequences and timeliness when he introduces
David, a professed C.O. David perceives the
imperfect illusion of the priesthood but acts as
altar boy in a mass celebrated with cabbage wine
and leaves. The potential for clarifying the
relationship between war and religion,
closely-related in the play, is never realized.
The late arrival of Bible-quoting-bayonet-toting
Sergeant Glitter and two of his men promises some
interesting interaction, but this is not in the script.
The confrontation deteriorates into adolescent
taunting and a not-too-complicated whodunit.
Certainly there is a lot to be said for realistic
dialogue, and it is self-evident that people often
say trite things, but "Lightening at a Funeral"
seemed to contain an excess of trivial and
annoying realism on this level.
The "You better sleep with one eye open
tonight, Sarge, 'cause I'm going to get ya,"
declarations made on today's battlefields are
presumably articulated with less regard for
television theatrics than those made by Pinner's
Corporal Jim.
Authentic Set
The Little Theater stage, effectively
approximating an authentic old European
"ramshackle church" (not one of these new Bank
of America architectural wonders), can boast what
must be a first in set design: the frayed stained
glass window. Unfortunately, while the set
establishes a believable setting, it defeats the
playwright's claim that this drama could occur
"anywhere war is," because it certainly isn't
Southeast Asia or the Mideast or Palo Alto or
almost anywhere but Western Europe.
"Lightening at a Funeral" will be performed
March 5, 6, 10, 11, 12 and 13 at 8 :00 p.m. and
March 6 at 2:00 p.m. in the Little Theater.
Admission is $ 2 ;$ 1 for students.

The Company opened a unique production of "Macbeth"
Wednesday evening in the Roble dining hall. Co-directors Peter
Samelson and Barbara Epmeier have attempted to combine stylistic
elements of the classic Japanese Noh theater with Shakespeare's verse,
and the result is far more interesting than one might think.
At first, the idea of applying the conventions of the Japanese art
form to "Macbeth" sounds like another gimmick, in the same
category as doing "Hamlet" in the style of Aeschylus, or some such
nonsense. But Samelson and Epmeier apparently have taken their job
very seriously, and it would be extremely presumptuous to dismiss
this production out of hand.
Which is not to say that we have here the definitive interpretation
of the play. Not at all. While The Company's "Macbeth" is interesting,
it is also, in many ways, a bit shallow. Perhaps it would be easier to
say what this production is not, rather than what it is: it is not
Shakespeare.
Stripped To Essentials
If one thinks of it as an adaptation of "Macbeth," rather than a
rendition, it is easier to appreciate. Samelson and Epmeier have
stripped "Macbeth" to its barest essentials. Half of the characters are
missing, including Duncan his two sons, innumerable lords, murderers,
witches, and the like.
What is left is a very simple telling of an already simple story. Gone
are the nuances of character, the connective tissue, the meat, that
makes Shakespeare so exciting; what's left is the bones, indestructible,
but often unconnected.
With all the subsidiary action removed, we have a very fast-moving
story of murder and revenge. The Nob elements, when apparent, tend
to contribute, a special feeling that perhaps justifies somewhat the
liberties that have been taken with the script.
Richard Cordtz and Cris Rose play the crucial roles of Macbeth and
Lady Macbeth. While I found them exciting to watch, I think they
suffered from the tremendous amount of cutting that went on all
around them.
Complex Steep-Walker
Cordtz's Macbeth seemed to be a very ill-defined character. The
conflicting drives of ambition and guilt were there, but they
co-existed separately, acting out their independent roles, almost never
touching. It was like watching one actor play two parts.
Rose's Lady Macbeth was more successful. This is perhaps the most
difficult, most complex character in the play, and she was doing just
fine, until her sleep-walking scene was pre-empted by a mixed chorus.
In any case, one can't complain about the price (free, with an
optional donation when you leave), and if you have an hour and a half
to spare some evening this weekend, you might want to drop by the
Roble dining hall at 8 :00 p.m.
