# Ballet Company Features Excellence
## 
### RUST EDDIE 
Arabesques, fouettes, pirouettes
and grands jetes all surfaced
somewhere in the Afrierican Ballet
Theater's capsule repertoire
during the company's week-long
engagement.
A showcase of stars, A.B.T.
introduced to San Francisco the
Kirov Ballet's latest gift to the
"free world," Natalia Makarova,
and returned to us such ballet
luminaries as Erik Bruhn, Ted
Kivitt, Ivan Nagy, Mimi Paul,
Roni Mahler and San Francisco's
own Cynthia Gregory.
The company has about it that
"the best that money can buy"
lookâ€”and indeed it should.
According to one of the star
dancers, who concurrently serves
incognito as the company's
artistic director, company director
Lucia Chase has contributed $22
million to A.B.T. through the
years.
For her pains, Miss Chase reigns
as queen in "Swan Lake." In what

the aforementioned dancer lables
"her own terrible pantomine,"
Miss Chase commands the stage in
David Blair's version of the
Tchaikovsky classic.
Soviet Ballerina
But who goes to the ballet to
see a sexagenarian patron, when
there is Natalia Makarova, latest
Soviet darling of Western press?
Undisputedly, Miss Makarova is
a nugget of considerable worth,
but amidst such company gams as
Fracci, Paul and Gregory, she does
not always shine clearly.
The opening night performance
of Fokine's "Les Sylphides" was a
textbook illustration of an
irresistable force (Miss Paul)
meeting an immovable object
(Miss Makarova).
This "en blanc" ballet set to
the music of Chopin requires
three female leads, danced
Monday night by Makarova, Paul
and Mahler. Whether or not it was
due to Miss Makarova's slight,
5-foot-two frame and Miss Paul's

long limbs, as some critics suggest,
Mimi Paul virtually eclipsed her
Russian counterpart.
Undulating Movements
The audience basked in Miss
Paul's lyric projections, especially
her undulating arm movements
which seemed to ripple and flow
from one arm's finger points to
the other.
Ivan Nagy, the male lead in 'Les
Sylphides' surprised with three
soaring leaps in the waltz, all
masterfully executed. Among the
male dancers in A.B.T.'s lineup,
however, Bruhn inpresses most
consistently. Making his
comeback after a serious injury
last year which all but ended his
dance career, Bruhn demonstrated
the technique which has earned
him the accolade of the world's
foremost "danseur noble."
His partner, Cynthia Gregory,
triggered the biggest ovation of
the night Monday. She eloquently
emoted those qualities required of
her role- a young woman taught

to fear and hate men by her
mother. The part is undoubtedly
very taxing on dancing and
dramatic skills, but Miss Gregory
was happily a match for it.
If there was one relatively
unknown dancer worthy of more
of the media's consideration, it
proved to be Ted Kivitt who
danced the "Pas de Deux" from
"Don Quixote." Integrating
technique, bravura, and precision
in pleasing proportions, Kivitt

drew adeptly from the arsneal of
dance.
Elenor D'Antuono, his partner,
projected the proper flamboyance
while remaining as buoyant as
wood floating on water. Their
performances dovetailed nicely,
without one dancer
overshadowing the other.
The star-laden company will
finish its San Francisco
engagement this weekend.
