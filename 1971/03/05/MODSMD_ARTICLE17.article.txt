BOULDER, COLO—In their first game last night, the Stanford
hockey team romped over the lowa State Cyclones, 18-5, for their
biggest offensive output of the season. The win may have been costly,
however, as freshman center Tom Bedford was injured in the second
period and will be lost for the remainder of the season.
The team had a little difficulty adjusting to the bigger rink and
high altitude, but it only took them one period to find themselves.
Stanford scored first, but fell behind, 2-1. Will Mcllvaine tied the
score, 2-2, to end the first period. Although scoring only twice, the
team had 27 shots on goal in that period.
The second frame was all Stanford's as the team held the Cyclones
to a single goal while tallying seven times themselves. Coach Pat
Baldwin and Russ MacAusland scored twice while Bedford, Tom
Melcher, and Ed Keonard added single goals.
