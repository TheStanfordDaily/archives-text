# Track Team Opens Season Saturday
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's varsity track and
field squad will open the 1971
season this Saturday at 1:15 p.m.
when it meets Fresno State and
Occidental at Stanford Stadium.
Coach Payton Jordan's team
was winless in dual meet
competition last year, but the
addition of talented freshmen
improves the outlook for this
year's squad.
Freshman Ken Curl ran a 9.3
100-yard dash in high school and
will be a great asset to the team
when he hits top form this season.
Rufus Shaw has already surpassed
his best high school time by
turning in a 48.8 in the 44 0
during pre-season workouts.
Another freshman, Steve Hopkins,
has thrown the javelin 223 feet
and will give the Indians strength
in the field events.
Jordan will be able to rely on
several outstanding veterans
returning this season. Rick
Tipton, the Pac-8 high hurdle

champion in 1 9fi9 , has recovered
from the injuries that hampered
him last year and appears ready to
explore his potential as a world
class high-hurdler.
Don Kardong and Duncan
Macdonald should be consistent
point winners for Stanford in the
distance events, and Chuck
Francis, Tipton, and Curl will lead
the sprinters.
Randy White, Stanford record
holder in the 4 4 0 -yard
intermediate hurdles with 51.5,
has run very well in pre-season
practice and should easily break
his own records this season.
In the field events, both Casey
Carrigan and Tom Anderson
return to help the Indians in the
pole vault and long jump.
Carrigan, who competed in the
1968 Olympics, is hoping to jump
over 17 feet consistently this
season and Anderson is planning
to establish a new Stanford record
with a 25-foot jump during the
varsity's spring campaign.
