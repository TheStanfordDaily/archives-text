Nickle Bag rallied from a 21-7
deficit last night to beat the Delts
in overtime, 48-46, and capture
the intramural basketball
championship.
Both teams pulled off upset
victories on Wednesday night to
get into the finals. The Delts
scored six points in the last 4 0
seconds to beat the KA's, 4 5 -42,
and Nickle Bag came from behind
to edge second seeded Kappa
Sigma, 4 0-37.
The shooting of Mark Hansen
helped bring Nickle Bag from 1 4

points down and put them into a
29-28 lead with 11 minutes left in
the game. Both squads committed
numerous turnovers due to
nervousness as Nickle Bag held a
narrow lead in the last minutes of
play.
The Delt press netted two last
minute turnovers, and they tied
the score at 39 all at the end of
regulation time.
Sparked by the play of Hansen,
Don Nichols, and Jay Hoff, Nickle
Bag pulled out to a 4 6-41 lead in
overtime and the Delts never
caught up.
