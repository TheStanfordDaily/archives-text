# Constitutional, Political Arguments Seek To Avert Court Injunction
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN CRAIG NORDLUND News Analysis 
Today is the fifth, and perhaps the
final day of the complicated injunction
hearing in which University attorneys
are trying to replace a three week-old
temporary restraining order (TRO)
with a potentially devastating
preliminary injunction.
The TRO, which enjoins a broad
spectrum of physically and politically
disruptive activities, is being attacked
by the defense from two familiar lines.
One is the constitutional approach in
which attorneys Andrew Cohen and
Norton Tooby have expressed fearful
apprehensions of the ramifications of a
preliminary injunction—ramifications
which would jeopardize the first
amendment rights of the 17 defendants
and 10 00 John Does.
The second line of argument is the
markedly diverse political
approach—one that places the causes of
University—community confrontation
in a political context, one that impugns
the University for its complicity in the
Indochinese war, and one which erects
a moral imperative for absolute
intolerance for the architects and
executioners of American foreign
policy.
Political Argument
The political argument is espoused
mainly by Bruce Franklin and Janet
Weiss, who represent themselves in the
hearing, and by Steve Heiser, a law
student who represented the
defendants of the alleged Lodge
disruption in the SJC hearings.
Franklin has been given until 5 :00
p.m. of the second workday after the
injunction outcome is determined to
request a hearing before the Faculty
Advisory Board on his University
charges. He has charged that "the main

business of Stanford is maintaining and
expanding an empire in the Pacific
Basin." Weiss has been more specific,
calling Lodge's appearance on campus
an attempt by the Administration to
prove to the American people that the
anti-war movement was dead.
Heiser charged that the essential
issues—those which centered around
the war criminality of Lodge and other
advocates of U.S. foreign policy—are
being ignored by the court because it is
charged to perpetuate the status quo.
Carries Little Weight
It is doubtful whether this line of
defense will carry much weight in a
court of law—one that claims to be
a-political, and which, out of principle,
must adhere to pure legal standards.
In court, the political approach will
constitute a sincere, eloquent analysis
with minute legal impact. The crux of
the defense lies in the jealous effort to
defend the first amendment rights—an
effort which will probably not be
sufficient to evade a preliminary
injunction, but one which could
conceivably deprive it of critical
summary powers.
The basic constitutional question in
the hearing has centered around the
potentially explosive issue of whether
or not the injunction is an infringement
on the defendant's rights as guaranteed
by the first amendment. In his closing
statement, defense attorney Andrew
Cohen said that section eight of the
injunction, which bars all non-students
from campus, is basically an attempt to
"exile the defendants from their land."
Old Injunction
University attorney David Heilbron
denies this effect citing as evidence a
temporary injunction Stanford secured
two years ago. He maintains that three
key paragraphs in that injunction, still
in effect, are identical to those in the

injunction the University is now
seeking.
The old injunction, Heilbron argues,
did not deter legitimate political
activity and neither will the new one.
According to Cohen, Stanford is
more public than private and any
attempt to keep the defendants off
campus could be likened to the
medieval or monarchical practice of
