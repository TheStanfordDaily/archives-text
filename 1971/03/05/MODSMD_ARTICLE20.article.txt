The Stanford Varsity lacrosse
team travels to Oakland this
Saturday to play the East Bay
Lacrosse Club at 1 :()() p.m. at the
Oak Knoll Naval Hospital.
This Saturday's match will
mark the beginning of a
fourteen-game schedule this spring
for the Indians featuring a match
with Air Force, a national lacrosse
power, that will be played on
Stanford's rugby field at 1 :00
p.m. on March 13 .
Coach Eakland expects his
offense to be led by Butch Hazlett
and Chip Loveman, a powerful
goal-scoring combination that
should set Stanford scoring
records this season.
Wade Killefer is Stanford's
outstanding defensive player but
Eaklund will have to start
unexperienced men at the other
three defensive positions.
Stanford upset Air Force, 9-5,
the last time the Cadets came out
west. The Indians were trounced
last year at Colorado Springs,
however, by the score of 12-2. It
is unfortunate that Stanford has
to meet the Cadets so early in the
season, but the match should be
exciting and an upset possible.
