# Women Gymnasts Perform
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's Women's
Gymnastics team will compete
tomorrow with girls from U of
Nevada at Reno and UC Davis at
2 :00 p.m. in the Old Pavilion. The
admission is free.
Coach Heidi Klaus expects
"tough competition" from the
Nevada gymnasts, but hardly
discounts her girls' talent. Her
philosophy on gymnastics
parallels that of her male
counterpart at Stanford, Men's
Gymnastic Coach Dan Millman.
"The girls have worked very hard.
But 1 believe that gymnastics
should be enjoyable as well as
beautiful for both the spectator
and the performer.
Gymnastics ... 1 think it's almost
just art. It's like painting a
picture," Miss Klaus commented.

"You start with an idea. Then
it's all facial and body expression.
Gymnastics is the most skillful
event in physical education and
there's always some danger, too,"
Coach Klaus said.
Lisa Quinn, an all-around
performer, says, "Team members
agree with Miss Kalus in her
philosophy that gymnastics
should not be practiced to the
point that it becomes work, but
that it should always be FUN
FIRST."
According to Miss Klaus,
women's gym is "different" than
men's. First, four events are run
simultaneously. Second,
free-exercise is performed to
music. Third, three classes of
competition are offered: beginner,
intermediate, and advanced.
Finally, females perform instead
of males.

Performing for Stanford will be
the following girls:
All-around—Lisa Quinn, Jean Jerome,
Candy Eggris, Jean Vanetton.
Free-exercise-Julia Cates, Tina Hwang,
Janette IMegley, Ann Fisher.
Vaulting—Cates, Meg Bond, Cassey
Connor, Alisen Wenke, Negley, Ann
Watson. Balance beam- Vanetton.
Uneven parallel bars-Bond, Connor,
Wenke.


POETRY IN MOTION-All-around performer Lisa Quinn executing
her free-exercise routine is only one of the many talented women
gymnasts who will appear Saturday at 2 :00 p.m. in the Old Pavilion in
tri-team gymnastics competition featuring girls from Stanford,
Nevada, and Davis. Sports buffs can view the performance for free.
