### TOM QUINN 
The Indians head into the
weekend with a 10-6-1 record
under their belts after beating
UOP, but losing to San Jose State
earlier in the week. The team
whipped UOP, 3 -0, on Tuesday at
Stockton,yet gained only asplitfor
the weekend when the Spartans
squeaked by Stanford, 4-3, in the
bottom of the ninth inning.
This afternoon at 2:30 p.m. at
Sunken Diamond, Stanford's
baseball squad meets St. Mary's in
the first of three games this
weekend. On Saturday, the
Indians entertain Fresno State in a
double-header that begins at
noon.

Jim Coate pitched
magnificently on Tuesday in
registering his first victory of the
season after a bout with
mononucleosis had sidelined him
earlier in the year. Dick Borchers'
double drove in two of the
Indians' runs and a subsequent
wild pitch brought Vic Larrianuzzi
home to wrap up all the scoring
by the third inning.
On Wednesday, the infield
defense fell through once again,
breaking a 3-3 tie and giving San
Jose an unexpected win in the
bottom of the ninth inning. Dan
Shaw absorbed the loss in relief of
Rod Boone and saw his record
evened at 3-3.
