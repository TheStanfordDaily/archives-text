Standard Oil Protest Erupts
SAN JOSE — A demonstration protesting Standard Oil Co.
of California recruiters erupted into fighting on the San
Jose State College campus Thursday, resulting in injuries to
four policemen and at least five students. 1 2 persons were
reported arrested.
Police chief Ray Blackmore said Sgts. Gregory Sargent,
48, and Robert Broos, 30, were hospitalized after they
were kicked reportedly by demonstrators.
Two other officers, Sgt. Mike Van Dyke and patrolman
Robert Gingery, 30, suffered cuts on the head.
Bill Hall, station manager of the campus radio station,
KSJS, said that 5 to ten students were also injured. Hall
said the confrontation lasted for three and a half hours.
The trouble began when about 25 to 30 demonstrators
carrying a mock oil derrick attempted to enter the Student
Union where company recruiters were interviewing
students.
A scuffle ensued when college security officers tried to
stop them on a stairway leading into the building.
Campus Security Chief Ernest Quntin declared the
demonstration which had been called by the San Jose
Liberation Front, an illegal assembly and ordered the
portesters to disperse.
When they refused, San Jose police were called and
tactical squad units were sent in.
As police tried to take away three persons arrested, a
crowd of about 40 0 formed around the entrance to the
Student Union and other officers were called in. The
officers then cleared the area.
