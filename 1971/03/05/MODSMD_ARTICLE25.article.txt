# Stanford Summary
## Student Presidents Form Lobby 
### 
A group of University student
presidents including Stanford's Adam
Levin, will establish a national
association of student presidents. They
made the announcement after meetings
with Washington government officials
this past week.
The association would create a
lobbying force in Washington to
influence the national government with
an accurate reflection of national
student opinion. Organization of
students to work in the 197 2
campaigns would be a key point in
resizing "the full potential of their 12
million individuals."
The student presidents suggested as
organization areas: 1. canvassing local
areas to evoke community
participation; 2. active support of
established political organizations and
declared candidates; 3. active efforts to
secure 100 percent voter registration,
including the new 18-20 year age
group; 4 . political documents and peace
proposals.
