# Law School Applications Increase
## 
### DAVE GLOSSBRENNER 
Applications for admission to the
Stanford Law School have increased by
fifty percent this year, according to
William Keogh, associate dean of the
Stanford Law School. "This increase
(in applications) is the most dramatic in
the history of the law school," Keogh
said.
Admission officials had expected
around 27- applications this year after
having just over 2400 last year.
However, in the last month the number
of applicants has passed 3 600 with the
deadline not yet reached. The school
hopes to have a first year class of
around 160 next Fall.
Stanford, however, is not an isolated
case among the nation's law schools. At
Harvard law school applications are also
up nearly 50%. At the University of
Southern California the number of
applicants has at least doubled in recent
years with a 50% increase this year.
Currently the USC admission officials
expect around 8 00 applications for the
150 places in their next class. At
Columbia law school officials have seen
a "tremendous upsurge" in applications
with more coming.
In trying to explain this sudden

interest in the law, Keogh notes the
increase in social awareness all over the
country. Many people, he says, are
finding that "the lawyer's skills are
those that eventually push him into the
decision making role." A person can
bring about real change by assuming
this role in education, business, and the
legislature.
Keogh also pointed out that "the
minorities are convinced that they can
make it" in law. With a law degree one
can work toward reducing the
inequities in the system.
Minorities, he continued, are finding
a warm welcome in the nation's law
schools. Federal and State agencies are
working with the schools to enrole
students from the "significantly
misrepresented" sections of society.
Keogh added that in recent years
more and more females have entered
the profession of law. Here at Stanford
the number of women applying to the
Sshool has definitely increased and
Keogh olfuim they are treated no
differently than men.
Can't Rank Schools
While noting the increases at other
schools, Keogh feels that Stanford's
increase in law school applicants is

proportionately among the greatest. He
doesn't believe, though, that anyone
can rank the nation's schools. He
commented that "this nonsense about
who is one, two, three is just that."
With half a dozen first rate schools in
the country an undergraduate can,
Keogh believes, look beyond the school
itself to choose the right one. He also
feels that there are enough law schools
in the country so that any qualified
student can find a receptive one.
Professor Keogh believes, though,
that there many reasons pecular to
Stanford for such a large increase in law
school applications. For one, Keogh
feels that "because of a curriculum
fashioned by the faculty and because? of
the faculty itself" Stanford has an
exciting reputation and that that
reputation is rapidly growing.
Remained Small
Also, while maintaining a faculty
with "exciting personalities" the Law
School has remained relatively *raall.
By comparison the first year class at
the Harvard Law School is larger than
all three classes here at Stanford
combined. Keogh beleives that this
relative smallness makes Stanford even
more attractive.

According to Keogh, Stanford's
location makes it a place of action. The
Bay Area is a "good laboratory" for the
future lawyer. In recent years more and
more Stanford Law students have
found themselves working in the local
courts. In a program that one
publication called unparalled in
California legal history, Stanford
students have actually acted as
prosecutors for San Mateo County.

can rank the nation's schools. He
commented that "this nonsense about
who is one, two, three is just that."
With half a dozen first rate schools in
the country an undergraduate can,
Keogh believes, look beyond the school
itself to choose the right one. He also
feels that there are enough law schools
in the country so that any qualified
student can find a receptive one.
Professor Keogh believes, though,
that there many reasons pecular to
Stanford for such a large increase in law
school applications. For one, Keogh
feels that "because of a curriculum
fashioned by the faculty and because? of
the faculty itself" Stanford has an
exciting reputation and that that
reputation is rapidly growing.
Remained Small
Also, while maintaining a faculty
with "exciting personalities" the Law
School has remained relatively *raall.
By comparison the first year class at
the Harvard Law School is larger than
all three classes here at Stanford
combined. Keogh beleives that this
relative smallness makes Stanford even
more attractive.

According to Keogh, Stanford's
location makes it a place of action. The
Bay Area is a "good laboratory" for the
future lawyer. In recent years more and
more Stanford Law students have
found themselves working in the local
courts. In a program that one
publication called unparalled in
California legal history, Stanford
students have actually acted as
prosecutors for San Mateo County.
Applications for admission to the
Stanford Law School have increased by
fifty percent this year, according to
William Keogh, associate dean of the
Stanford Law School. "This increase
(in applications) is the most dramatic in
the history of the law school," Keogh
said.
Admission officials had expected
around 27- applications this year after
having just over 2400 last year.
However, in the last month the number
of applicants has passed 3 600 with the
deadline not yet reached. The school
hopes to have a first year class of
around 160 next Fall.
Stanford, however, is not an isolated
case among the nation's law schools. At
Harvard law school applications are also
up nearly 50%. At the University of
Southern California the number of
applicants has at least doubled in recent
years with a 50% increase this year.
Currently the USC admission officials
expect around 8 00 applications for the
150 places in their next class. At
Columbia law school officials have seen
a "tremendous upsurge" in applications
with more coming.
In trying to explain this sudden

interest in the law, Keogh notes the
increase in social awareness all over the
country. Many people, he says, are
finding that "the lawyer's skills are
those that eventually push him into the
decision making role." A person can
bring about real change by assuming
this role in education, business, and the
legislature.
Keogh also pointed out that "the
minorities are convinced that they can
make it" in law. With a law degree one
can work toward reducing the
inequities in the system.
Minorities, he continued, are finding
a warm welcome in the nation's law
schools. Federal and State agencies are
working with the schools to enrole
students from the "significantly
misrepresented" sections of society.
Keogh added that in recent years
more and more females have entered
the profession of law. Here at Stanford
the number of women applying to the
Sshool has definitely increased and
Keogh olfuim they are treated no
differently than men.
Can't Rank Schools
While noting the increases at other
schools, Keogh feels that Stanford's
increase in law school applicants is

proportionately among the greatest. He
doesn't believe, though, that anyone
can rank the nation's schools. He
commented that "this nonsense about
who is one, two, three is just that."
