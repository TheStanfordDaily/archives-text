# Nixon: Laos Invasion 'A Success'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON—In his first televised
press conference since December,
President Richard M. Nison last night
termed the Laosian invasion "a
success" and ruled to rule out a
South Vietnamese invasion of North
Vietnam with U.S. air support.
Responding to a followup question,
Nixon said: "I can say further that no
such plan has even been suggested by
President Thieu to us, none has been
considered, and none is under
consideration. I'm not going to go
further than that.
" ... . The test as to what the
United States will do in North Vietnam
will always be not what happens to
forces of South Vietnam but it will be
whether the President. as
Commander-in-Chief, considers that
North Vietnamese activities are
endangering or may endanger the
American forces as we continue
withdraw. It is then and only then that
I will use air-power against military
complexes on the borders of North
Vietnam."
Nixon also hailed his Vietnamization
program's "success" and said the South

Vietnamese army has demonstrated it
can "hack it" against "the very best"
North Vietnamese troops. This will, he
said, ensure the continuing withdrawal
of American troops from the
Indochinese war theater.
"The disruption of the enemy supply
lines through Laos, which has now
occurred for three weeks, has very
seriously damaged the enemy's ability
to wage effective action against our
remaining forces in Vietnam, and
assures even more the success of our
troop withdrawal program.
"Gen. Abrams tells me that in both
Laos and in Cambodia, his evaluation
after three weeks of fighting is that, to
use his terms the South Vietnamese, by
themselves, can 'hack it' and they can
give a better account of themselves
than even the North Vietnamese units.
"This means that our withdrawal
program, our Vietnamization program,
is a success and continues on schedule
and we trust even ahead of schedule,
assuming that there is more progress in
Laos," he concluded.
Despite efforts of capital newsmen
to pin him down, the President refused

to rule out all possibility of an invasion
of North Vietnam.
"... I have stated that in two
respects we would use air power against
the North. One, that we would attack
those missile sites that fire at our planes,
and we have been doing that, we will
continue to do that. Second, that if I
determine that increased infiltration
from North Vietnam endangers our

remaining forces in South Vietnam . ..
"No such plan (use of American air
power to support a "South Vietnamese
operation against the North") is under
consideration in this government."
And, reiterating his past statements,
Nixon said that "as long as there are
American POWs (in North Vietnam),
we will have to keep some troops in
(South) Vietnam.

than even the North Vietnamese units.
"This means that our withdrawal
program, our Vietnamization program,
is a success and continues on schedule
and we trust even ahead of schedule,
assuming that there is more progress in
Laos," he concluded.
Despite efforts of capital newsmen
to pin him down, the President refused

to rule out all possibility of an invasion
of North Vietnam.
"... I have stated that in two
respects we would use air power against
the North. One, that we would attack
those missile sites that fire at our planes,
and we have been doing that, we will
continue to do that. Second, that if I
determine that increased infiltration
from North Vietnam endangers our

remaining forces in South Vietnam . ..
"No such plan (use of American air
power to support a "South Vietnamese
operation against the North") is under
consideration in this government."
And, reiterating his past statements,
Nixon said that "as long as there are
American POWs (in North Vietnam),
we will have to keep some troops in
(South) Vietnam.
WASHINGTON—In his first televised
press conference since December,
President Richard M. Nison last night
termed the Laosian invasion "a
success" and ruled to rule out a
South Vietnamese invasion of North
Vietnam with U.S. air support.
Responding to a followup question,
Nixon said: "I can say further that no
such plan has even been suggested by
President Thieu to us, none has been
considered, and none is under
consideration. I'm not going to go
further than that.
" ... . The test as to what the
United States will do in North Vietnam
will always be not what happens to
forces of South Vietnam but it will be
whether the President. as
Commander-in-Chief, considers that
North Vietnamese activities are
endangering or may endanger the
American forces as we continue
withdraw. It is then and only then that
I will use air-power against military
complexes on the borders of North
Vietnam."
Nixon also hailed his Vietnamization
program's "success" and said the South

Vietnamese army has demonstrated it
can "hack it" against "the very best"
North Vietnamese troops. This will, he
said, ensure the continuing withdrawal
of American troops from the
Indochinese war theater.
"The disruption of the enemy supply
lines through Laos, which has now
occurred for three weeks, has very
seriously damaged the enemy's ability
to wage effective action against our
remaining forces in Vietnam, and
assures even more the success of our
troop withdrawal program.
"Gen. Abrams tells me that in both
Laos and in Cambodia, his evaluation
after three weeks of fighting is that, to
use his terms the South Vietnamese, by
themselves, can 'hack it' and they can
give a better account of themselves
than even the North Vietnamese units.
"This means that our withdrawal
program, our Vietnamization program,
is a success and continues on schedule
and we trust even ahead of schedule,
assuming that there is more progress in
Laos," he concluded.
