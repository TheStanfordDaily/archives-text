# Student Draft Speech Unexpectly Cut Short
## 
### 
Stanford freshman Pete Knutson,
testifying before the House Armed
Services Committee Tuesday, had his
testimony abruptly cut short allegedly
due to "time limitations."
He was permitted to read only about
five minutes of his fifteen-minute-long
prepared statement before being told
that, because of the number of
witnesses to be heard, he would not be
able to deliver all of his testimony.
The committee is currently holding
hearings regarding the Selective Service
System. The draft bill will soon be up
for Congressional renewal.
Earlier on Tuesday morning, the
Committee had heard a full hour of
testimony from each of two pro-draft
witnesses, both of them military
veterans. It was after the lunch break
when Knutson's address was
interrupted.
Knutson immediately became
embroiled in a heated discussion with a
Florida congressman who was acting as
temporary Committee Chairman.
According to Knutson, "he started

flipping some shit at me, and he asked
me whether Congress had done a lot for
young people. I told him, 'As far as the
draft goes, Congress had done
absolutely nothing for young people.'
"He really took it personally."
In spite of the fact that the full
statement was not read, each
congressman on the Committee was
given a copy of the testimony. In
addition, Massachusetts Congressman
Herrington, a Democrat, had the
testimony entered into the
Congressional Record.
Knution was selected to testify
almost by chance. He heard that the
hearings were going to be held, so he
wrote letters two months ago to the
chairmen of the Senate and House
Armed Services Committees: Sen.
Stennis and Rep. Hebert. Knutson
testified before the Senate Committee
on February 8. His statement then
caused an irate Strom Thurmond to
walk out of the hearing chamber.
Knutson says he was a "token
student" for the Committee, which
allegedly was trying to represent all
viewpoints. "The bill affects 25 million
people," said Knutson, "so they have
two students testifying. That's real
representation." (A UC Berkeley
student also testified before the House
Committee.)
Since his February testimony,
Knutson has received a lot of
mailâ€”according to him, about
eight-to-one in favor of his views. Some
correspondents have been sad and
thoughtful. One Indiana farmer whose
been bitter. One letter from Florida
began, "Dear Coward." Another writer
sent a news clipping, with "Too bad
Hitler didn't win the war" written in
the margin.
