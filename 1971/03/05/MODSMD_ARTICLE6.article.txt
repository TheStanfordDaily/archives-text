# decentralized, democratic socialism
## Where We Would Like To Go jeff weil 
### 
It is important every once in a
while to be explicit about what
we are working toward. A
discussion of goals can be valuable
to answer those who ask "if you
want to tear down everything,
what are you going to replace it
withT' But, more important, it
can inform the actions we take
toward our goals. What follows is
an indication, not a blueprint, of
the type of society we would like
to have:
We want a decentralized,
democratic socialism. We want
pc pie to control the institutions
that affect them. A subset of
popular control is worker's
control (not a dictatorship of the
proletariat). Democracy cannot be
real until taken to its logical
economic conclusion.
Experts should provide the
information necessary for popular
decision on allocations. For
instance, there will still be
engineers who design the shape of
a wing for an airplane, but it
should be a popular decision
whether there is to be any
airplane manufactured at all, or
whether a cheaper model should
be made. Workers should hire
their own managers and set their
own production goals. In this type
of industrial democracy, the
aeronautics engineer would be no
more important than the
machinist. This type of system
would eliminate lay-offs,
speed-ups, the conditions that
caused 14,000 industrial deaths
last year, and many of the
alienating aspects of labor. The
expropriation of the capitalists
would eliminate the profit
motivation that uses planned
obsolescence and that is at least
one of the main movers of
imperialism.
It is important not only that
the outrages of poverty be
eliminated, but also that this be
done in such a way as to
maximize popular decision
making. For instance, not only
should medicine be free and
available to all, but the
administration of medical clinics
should be under community
control.
Those who feel that efficiency

should not be a criterion for a
humane society should talk to the
thousands of homeless families in
Prague. A modified market
economy would eliminate the
inefficiencies of a bureaucratized
central planning commission.
Coupled with workers' control, it
would not lead to the
concentration of power ancj
production for profit that we find
under capitalism.
We must safeguard the right of
people who think differently
(including those who like
capitalism) to express their
positions. There must be
opposition parties. Even a
"self-critical" party will be bound
by its own circle of assumpetions.
I would still want professors
and writers with ideas opposite to
mine to have a chance to air them.
But in a socialist economy, with

all funding in public hands,
couldn't black sheep thinkers
simply be denied the use of
funds? In order to allow divergent
ideas the chance to be tried out,
there should be multilateral
funding through several agencies
for science projects, research, or
newspapers. The fact that
"academic freedom" has been
used to defend engineering
genocide at universities and
"freedom of the press" is used to
characterize a system where the
media is largely controlled by the
rich does not negate the necessity
for free inquiry and divergence of
opinion of a free society.
What if the economy (just after
the revolution) is falling apart,
counterrevolutionaries are
exploiting it in the press, Milton
Friedman is calling for urban
guerrilla warfare to restore

capitalism, we call an emergency
meeting and PL fucks it up with a
filibuster on the nationalism
question, sailors with legitimate
demands (but suborned by David
Rockefeller) are threatening to
shut down every port in the
country? What do you do then,
daddy?
I always want to say, "Let it all
hang out," But I can see situations
where I would use force that
someone would view as repressive.
Many of the problems of
organization for smashing
capitalism and for building
socialism will have to be worked
out in practice, informed by a
spirit of democracy.
