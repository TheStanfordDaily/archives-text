# both sides want military victory
## Laos Invasion & Cambodia 
### 
(This is part two, which was
unable to be printed yesterday, of
a series on the strategies in the
Indochina War now.)
As related Wednesday, the
NVA and VC fled from the
sanctuaries after the Cambodia
Incursion to the underpopulated
NE quadrant of Cambodia and to
Angkor Wat, where Cambodian
resistance melted away as soon as
the battle endangered the restored
ruins. At these positions, the
Communists formed bases, set up
supply lines, and devised a
political vehicle for the local
villagers to aid and support them.
These villagers overcame ethnic
enmity and supported the
Communist's almost immediately.
They revered the deposed
Sihanouk and detested Lon Nol
and the military. They allowed
the Communists to stay in

Cambodia when the NVA and VC
were most vulnerable, and who
since have became the basis of the
Khmer Rouge.
The Khmer Rouge grew from a
5,000 man para-military
under-ground force to a 115,000
men above ground organization.
The KR, NVA, and VC have now
formed the New United Front
(NUF), with 15 0,000 plus
members, of which 5 0,000 are
disciplined and able fighters.
That the NUF would perform
the same "liberation" in
Cambodia that the NLF (now
PRG) has attempted in SVN
became apparent to the U.S.
intelligence and strategists last
June. No longer willing to trust
fortune, the U.S. saw the see-saw
nature of the "counter offensives"
since Tet, and began to anticipate
the next move. CIA and Aimy
intelligence picked up the
particular nature of the next
Communist move.
The following plan came forth:
an invasion of Laos, towards
Sepone and Attapeau from Khe
Sanh to "temporarily" cut and
disrupt supply and troop
movement on the Ho Chi Minh
Trail; a more important and less
spectacular initiative by a 25,000
man ARVN force to enter NE
Cambodia from the South and
East in order to interdict supplies
from Laos the NUF; skirmish and
surround the offensive in
co-ordination with the Cambodian
Army, and lay seige to it until the
NUF was "starved" out and
surrendered.
Certainly an ambitious plan.
And it is already being instigated.
Apparently it is succeeding in
part, in Cambodia, for the
Communists have yet to get out
of the "box" and begin their
offensives. The latest intelligence
indicates that they, too, are going
for high stakes. They are headed
South and to the East of Pnom
Phenh, to draw out and smash the

combat, while provacateurs in
Phom Phenh will start a
"popular" uprising among the
refugees (who revers Sihanouk),
overthrow and execute the Lon Nol
regime and re-instate Sihanouk.
With that coup, they could
continue unrelentingly into the
"Parrot's Beak" Area and
combine with PRG forces to
destroy recently Vietnamized
ranger out-post stations. If that is
successful, they are 30 miles or
one day from Saigon. With a
student uprising, disruption by
infiltrators of the ARVN and
Thier-Ky regime, and general
terrorism, they could go into
Saigon, take it, and win the war.
So both sides from the view of
one of them are in this latest
battle to militarily win the War.
The Communist strategy,
envisioned by U.S. intelligence,
seeks to take over Cambodia,
SVN, and the rest of Laos. The
U.S., by frustrating and
containing this strategy, could end
the last Communist territory (NV
and Eastern Laos). This result
would secure SVN, Cambodia,
and Western Laos, because the Ho
Chi Minh Trail cannot support a
continuously high level of
combat. The Communists could
then only formalize their
ineffectiveness through
negotiation.
Part three on the bottom of
this page frontation with this
issue; is the U.S.'s reasoning what
it declares itself to be, or are there
ulterior motives? If both start
aggression at the same time who is
the aggressor? Is selective
terrorism better, "more human"
than indiscriminate terrorism
from 30,000 feet? Who's fooling
who, and who's winning? And
who's in charge of the Fail Safe
system.
