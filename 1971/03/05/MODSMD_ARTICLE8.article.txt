# Open Letter To Library Director
## 
### 
Dear Mr. Weber, director of University Libraries:
Your leadership at the libraries has led to the
lowest level of morale I have ever witnessed in a
university institution. Only your immediate
resignation would help correct the evils visited on
the library in the last year.
It is common knowledge that the libraries are not
delivering adequate services to the community, and
that they are abominable places to work. That one
can no longer even make comparisons with
Berkeley's libraries attests to the deterioration
which has occurred. Poor working conditions are
the cause of poor service delivery.
The complaints are many, but can be summed up
as: 1. lack of leadership; 2. poor representation of
the library in the university community; 3. no
concern for personnel problems; and 4 . bad faith in
dealing with employees.
The upwelling of staff protest which followed
your suspension of John Keilch is symptomatic of
the poor morale in staff ranks. None of the opinions
voiced in the January 29 staff meeting to explain
your arbitrary action were sympathetic. This was a
native uprising, Mr. Weber, for outsiders (all five of
us) were barred from attending.
Your mimeographed defense of the suspension
states that this action was the only way for Keilch
to initiate grievance proceedings. The double-talk
here is patent: a man must be fired to protest, so
you are doing him a favor firing him! You admit
this "may not be the best way" to handle the
situation, but aver that "present campus procedures
offer no alternative." I take it you refer to recent
police security measures, not to 1968 guidelines for
campus governance. How can you expect to retain
staff confidence with such bureaucratic
buck-passing?

I suspect you allowed the "security assistants" to
sack Keilch, failing to show any leadership yourself.
Rather than stand up to whatever pressures there
were, to protect staff morale, you abrogated
representation of the library.
It is unclear whether you even knew of the low
staff morale before the Keilch affair. That the
catalogue and order departments are veritable snake
pits is no secret on campus. But the Keilch case
pointed up what few were willing to tolerate: that
irrespective of a person's job performance (Keilch's
was fine), he could be immediately terminated for
alleged political activities off the job, without so
much as a tip of the hat from you. Low pay, daily
harrassment, no union representation, degrading
"evaluations", inefficiency, gross discrimination, all
these became intolerable in light of the Keilch case.
Your bad faith in conducting this affair is
embarrassingly evident. Forced into a staff meeting
over the affair, you barred outsiders. Though there
were many alternative actions in the case, you aver
there were none. The grievance review committee is
stacked two to one against Keilch.
Had you known of the morale problems of the
library, and had you asserted a degree of leadership,
this crisis would have perhaps been averted. But
while you have busied yourself with parking lots
and buildings, you have demonstrated little concern
for the welfare and working conditions of the
hundreds of staff members. We who rely so heavily
on the libraries have suffered too.
It is your professional duty to restory John
Keilch to his job. It is your moral responsibility to
resign immediately, allowing a more competent
person to rebuild the university library system.

library, and had you asserted a degree of leadership,
this crisis would have perhaps been averted. But
while you have busied yourself with parking lots
and buildings, you have demonstrated little concern
for the welfare and working conditions of the
hundreds of staff members. We who rely so heavily
on the libraries have suffered too.
It is your professional duty to restory John
Keilch to his job. It is your moral responsibility to
resign immediately, allowing a more competent
person to rebuild the university library system.

Dear Mr. Weber, director of University Libraries:
Your leadership at the libraries has led to the
lowest level of morale I have ever witnessed in a
university institution. Only your immediate
resignation would help correct the evils visited on
the library in the last year.
It is common knowledge that the libraries are not
delivering adequate services to the community, and
that they are abominable places to work. That one
can no longer even make comparisons with
Berkeley's libraries attests to the deterioration
which has occurred. Poor working conditions are
the cause of poor service delivery.
The complaints are many, but can be summed up
as: 1. lack of leadership; 2. poor representation of
the library in the university community; 3. no
concern for personnel problems; and 4 . bad faith in
dealing with employees.
The upwelling of staff protest which followed
your suspension of John Keilch is symptomatic of
the poor morale in staff ranks. None of the opinions
voiced in the January 29 staff meeting to explain
your arbitrary action were sympathetic. This was a
native uprising, Mr. Weber, for outsiders (all five of
us) were barred from attending.
Your mimeographed defense of the suspension
states that this action was the only way for Keilch
to initiate grievance proceedings. The double-talk
here is patent: a man must be fired to protest, so
you are doing him a favor firing him! You admit
this "may not be the best way" to handle the
situation, but aver that "present campus procedures
offer no alternative." I take it you refer to recent
police security measures, not to 1968 guidelines for
campus governance. How can you expect to retain
staff confidence with such bureaucratic
buck-passing?

I suspect you allowed the "security assistants" to
sack Keilch, failing to show any leadership yourself.
Rather than stand up to whatever pressures there
were, to protect staff morale, you abrogated
representation of the library.
It is unclear whether you even knew of the low
staff morale before the Keilch affair. That the
catalogue and order departments are veritable snake
pits is no secret on campus. But the Keilch case
pointed up what few were willing to tolerate: that
irrespective of a person's job performance (Keilch's
was fine), he could be immediately terminated for
alleged political activities off the job, without so
much as a tip of the hat from you. Low pay, daily
harrassment, no union representation, degrading
"evaluations", inefficiency, gross discrimination, all
these became intolerable in light of the Keilch case.
Your bad faith in conducting this affair is
embarrassingly evident. Forced into a staff meeting
over the affair, you barred outsiders. Though there
were many alternative actions in the case, you aver
there were none. The grievance review committee is
stacked two to one against Keilch.
Had you known of the morale problems of the
library, and had you asserted a degree of leadership,
this crisis would have perhaps been averted. But
while you have busied yourself with parking lots
and buildings, you have demonstrated little concern
for the welfare and working conditions of the
hundreds of staff members. We who rely so heavily
