## What The Future May Hold For U.S. 
### 
First, I'll complete the U.S.'s
projection of the results of its
plans, as they unfold during the
next two months. Again, the
Indochina scenario is mainly
focused on frustrating of NUF
offensive in NE Cambodia. This is
presently being accomplished. The
Communist drive is stalled with
no logistics support; their food,
supplies, and ammunition are
running out. When their logistical
stores do run out, the ARVN
force containing them will
advance upon them. The result
will either be a massacre or
surrender. The U.S. hopes that
this will be accomplished by the
end of April.
The invasion of Laos was an
ambitious extension and
experiment of "Vietnamization."
The goal of the operation is to
hold positions in Southern Laos
and disrupt movement of troops
and supplies along the Ho Chi
Minh Trail until the monsoon

season commences, in early May.
Therefore, the Invasion has a
100-day timetable; if the ARVN
stay in Laos those 100 days, the
operation will be 100 percent
effective and successful. As of
now, the operation is 25 percent
successful. It will end prematurely
only if there appears to be an
imminent slaughter of ARVN
troops. Then the U.S. will
airlift-out the endangered troops,
and call a halt to the operation.
The effect of the Laos Invasion
will be peripheral upon the
Cambodian scenario. At most it
will stop what little supplies can
come down the Trail; it may also
occupy NVA troops who
otherwise would aid the NVF
drive. Therefore, as I said in part
two, the operations are related;
but the unpublicized Cambodian
operation is certainly the essential
one of the two, while the Invasion
is largely a showcase for
"Vietnamization," with none of
the magnitude that the media is
attaching to it, and little
importance in comparison to the
Cambodian operation.
Recapping these projections in
light of the U.S. war aims
mentioned in part 11, the present
operations will end effective NV
and VC offensive-capability
outside of the territories (Eastern
Laos and NV) they now control.
The NV and PRG will therefore
1-ave to negotiate or accept defeat
of its liberation of and
reunification with SVN.
Here are my doubts. The U.S.
may have been more than one
step ahead of the Communists,
and "triggered" their "offensive"
by starting the logistics
strangulation before the
Communists moved. Therefore,
the two "defensive"
counter-offensives may actually
be unprovoked agression against
Communist forces in Laos and
Cambodia. As well,
Pentagon-planners have a
tendency to turn operations called
"limited" and "defensive" into
rather unrestrained offensive
movements with very ambitions
goals. The Laos Invasion,
illustrates this tendency.
As to ulterior motives
(provoking China; setting up a

"desperate" situation to "justify"
use of tactical nuclear weapons
and/or an invasion-plus-resumed
bombing of NV; and other
"radical" interpretations of U.S.
intentions), I think they largely
are fictitious. China will not risk
involvement with the U.S.,
because of her inferior capacity
(at the present); so therefore the
U.S. would not bother to provoke
her, knowing she won't respond.
As well, the recent statements
of Thieu and Ky to the contrary,
the ARVN will not invade NV and
the U.S. will not use nuclear
weapons, tactical or strategic
unless the present operations fail.
Which brings me to the final
doubt, and the doubt which most
concerns me. The NVA (as the
Viet Minh, first; the DRNVA
later) have been fighting Western
armies and western backed Asian
armies, almost without halt, for
25 years. Fighting to win, fighting
anyone who stands in the way of
the reunification of Vietnam, has
become their life-purpose; the
cause of the death of many of
their comrades; the reason for
their overcoming seemingly
insurmountable odds. Nothing
short of Victory.
It is the most undaunted,
unstoppable, undefeatable,
incredibly tough military
organization in the history of
mankind. More than once before,
the U.S. was sure the NVA would
not risk what little it had, and
capitulate, either through
surrender or negotiation; each
time, the NVA risked all and
almost completely reversed its
position, from losing to winning.
And it might happen again.
They'll definitely try. If they
cause the present operations to
fail (the U.S. can't see how; but
they didn't see how before,
either); then the U.S. will find its
position completely undermined,
only supportable by the
alternative of escalation (invasion
and bombing of NV; use of
nuclear weapons, etc.) That is
why I'm concerned. If the NVA
and VC risk all and pull through,
then the U.S. will be on its last
heels in the prosecution of the
War in Indochina.

If, and only if, this reversal
occurs (there are many
precedents), all Hell will break
loose: the force of events will
dictate the powers that be to
escalate up to Armageddon. At
this point, the people of this
country and of all others directly
or indirectly involved in the
Indochina War must, in all means
effective and direct, persuade the
U.S. and its allies to accept defeat
of its purposes and intentions- to
lose. There's always a first time; if
events dictate the choice between
escalation and defeat, for
humanity's sake, the U.S. must be
persuaded to taste defeat.

"limited" and "defensive" into
rather unrestrained offensive
movements with very ambitions
goals. The Laos Invasion,
illustrates this tendency.
As to ulterior motives
(provoking China; setting up a

"desperate" situation to "justify"
use of tactical nuclear weapons
and/or an invasion-plus-resumed
bombing of NV; and other
"radical" interpretations of U.S.
intentions), I think they largely
are fictitious. China will not risk
involvement with the U.S.,
because of her inferior capacity
(at the present); so therefore the
U.S. would not bother to provoke
her, knowing she won't respond.
As well, the recent statements
of Thieu and Ky to the contrary,
the ARVN will not invade NV and
the U.S. will not use nuclear
weapons, tactical or strategic
unless the present operations fail.
Which brings me to the final
doubt, and the doubt which most
concerns me. The NVA (as the
Viet Minh, first; the DRNVA
later) have been fighting Western
armies and western backed Asian
armies, almost without halt, for
25 years. Fighting to win, fighting
anyone who stands in the way of
the reunification of Vietnam, has
become their life-purpose; the
cause of the death of many of
their comrades; the reason for
their overcoming seemingly
insurmountable odds. Nothing
short of Victory.
It is the most undaunted,
unstoppable, undefeatable,
incredibly tough military
organization in the history of
mankind. More than once before,
the U.S. was sure the NVA would
not risk what little it had, and
capitulate, either through
surrender or negotiation; each
time, the NVA risked all and
almost completely reversed its
position, from losing to winning.
And it might happen again.
They'll definitely try. If they
cause the present operations to
fail (the U.S. can't see how; but
they didn't see how before,
either); then the U.S. will find its
position completely undermined,
only supportable by the
alternative of escalation (invasion
and bombing of NV; use of
nuclear weapons, etc.) That is
why I'm concerned. If the NVA
and VC risk all and pull through,
then the U.S. will be on its last
heels in the prosecution of the
War in Indochina.

If, and only if, this reversal
occurs (there are many
precedents), all Hell will break
loose: the force of events will
dictate the powers that be to
escalate up to Armageddon. At
this point, the people of this
country and of all others directly
or indirectly involved in the
Indochina War must, in all means
effective and direct, persuade the
U.S. and its allies to accept defeat
of its purposes and intentions- to
lose. There's always a first time; if
events dictate the choice between
escalation and defeat, for
humanity's sake, the U.S. must be
persuaded to taste defeat.
(John Sullivan is the son of the
former ambassador to Laos.)
First, I'll complete the U.S.'s
projection of the results of its
plans, as they unfold during the
next two months. Again, the
Indochina scenario is mainly
focused on frustrating of NUF
offensive in NE Cambodia. This is
presently being accomplished. The
Communist drive is stalled with
no logistics support; their food,
supplies, and ammunition are
running out. When their logistical
stores do run out, the ARVN
force containing them will
advance upon them. The result
will either be a massacre or
surrender. The U.S. hopes that
this will be accomplished by the
end of April.
The invasion of Laos was an
ambitious extension and
experiment of "Vietnamization."
The goal of the operation is to
hold positions in Southern Laos
and disrupt movement of troops
and supplies along the Ho Chi
Minh Trail until the monsoon

season commences, in early May.
Therefore, the Invasion has a
100-day timetable; if the ARVN
stay in Laos those 100 days, the
operation will be 100 percent
effective and successful. As of
now, the operation is 25 percent
successful. It will end prematurely
only if there appears to be an
imminent slaughter of ARVN
troops. Then the U.S. will
airlift-out the endangered troops,
and call a halt to the operation.
The effect of the Laos Invasion
will be peripheral upon the
Cambodian scenario. At most it
will stop what little supplies can
come down the Trail; it may also
occupy NVA troops who
otherwise would aid the NVF
drive. Therefore, as I said in part
two, the operations are related;
but the unpublicized Cambodian
operation is certainly the essential
one of the two, while the Invasion
is largely a showcase for
"Vietnamization," with none of
the magnitude that the media is
attaching to it, and little
importance in comparison to the
Cambodian operation.
Recapping these projections in
light of the U.S. war aims
mentioned in part 11, the present
operations will end effective NV
and VC offensive-capability
outside of the territories (Eastern
Laos and NV) they now control.
The NV and PRG will therefore
1-ave to negotiate or accept defeat
of its liberation of and
reunification with SVN.
Here are my doubts. The U.S.
may have been more than one
step ahead of the Communists,
and "triggered" their "offensive"
by starting the logistics
strangulation before the
Communists moved. Therefore,
the two "defensive"
counter-offensives may actually
be unprovoked agression against
Communist forces in Laos and
Cambodia. As well,
Pentagon-planners have a
tendency to turn operations called
"limited" and "defensive" into

U.S. and its allies to accept defeat
of its purposes and intentions- to
lose. There's always a first time; if
events dictate the choice between
escalation and defeat, for
humanity's sake, the U.S. must be
persuaded to taste defeat.
(John Sullivan is the son of the
former ambassador to Laos.)
First, I'll complete the U.S.'s
projection of the results of its
plans, as they unfold during the
next two months. Again, the
Indochina scenario is mainly
focused on frustrating of NUF
offensive in NE Cambodia. This is
presently being accomplished. The
Communist drive is stalled with
no logistics support; their food,
supplies, and ammunition are
running out. When their logistical
stores do run out, the ARVN
force containing them will
advance upon them. The result
will either be a massacre or
surrender. The U.S. hopes that
this will be accomplished by the
end of April.
The invasion of Laos was an
ambitious extension and
experiment of "Vietnamization."
The goal of the operation is to
hold positions in Southern Laos
and disrupt movement of troops
and supplies along the Ho Chi
Minh Trail until the monsoon

season commences, in early May.
Therefore, the Invasion has a
100-day timetable; if the ARVN
stay in Laos those 100 days, the
operation will be 100 percent
effective and successful. As of
now, the operation is 25 percent
successful. It will end prematurely
only if there appears to be an
imminent slaughter of ARVN
troops. Then the U.S. will
airlift-out the endangered troops,
and call a halt to the operation.
The effect of the Laos Invasion
will be peripheral upon the
Cambodian scenario. At most it
will stop what little supplies can
come down the Trail; it may also
occupy NVA troops who
otherwise would aid the NVF
drive. Therefore, as I said in part
two, the operations are related;
but the unpublicized Cambodian
operation is certainly the essential
one of the two, while the Invasion
is largely a showcase for
"Vietnamization," with none of
the magnitude that the media is
attaching to it, and little
importance in comparison to the
Cambodian operation.
Recapping these projections in
light of the U.S. war aims
mentioned in part 11, the present
operations will end effective NV
and VC offensive-capability
outside of the territories (Eastern
Laos and NV) they now control.
The NV and PRG will therefore
1-ave to negotiate or accept defeat
of its liberation of and
reunification with SVN.
Here are my doubts. The U.S.
may have been more than one
step ahead of the Communists,
and "triggered" their "offensive"
by starting the logistics
strangulation before the
Communists moved. Therefore,
the two "defensive"
counter-offensives may actually
be unprovoked agression against
Communist forces in Laos and
Cambodia. As well,
Pentagon-planners have a
tendency to turn operations called
"limited" and "defensive" into
rather unrestrained offensive
movements with very ambitions
goals. The Laos Invasion,
illustrates this tendency.
As to ulterior motives
(provoking China; setting up a

"desperate" situation to "justify"
use of tactical nuclear weapons
and/or an invasion-plus-resumed
bombing of NV; and other
"radical" interpretations of U.S.
intentions), I think they largely
are fictitious. China will not risk
involvement with the U.S.,
because of her inferior capacity
(at the present); so therefore the
U.S. would not bother to provoke
her, knowing she won't respond.
As well, the recent statements
of Thieu and Ky to the contrary,
the ARVN will not invade NV and
the U.S. will not use nuclear
weapons, tactical or strategic
unless the present operations fail.
Which brings me to the final
doubt, and the doubt which most
concerns me. The NVA (as the
Viet Minh, first; the DRNVA
later) have been fighting Western
armies and western backed Asian
armies, almost without halt, for
25 years. Fighting to win, fighting
anyone who stands in the way of
the reunification of Vietnam, has
become their life-purpose; the
cause of the death of many of
their comrades; the reason for
their overcoming seemingly
insurmountable odds. Nothing
short of Victory.
It is the most undaunted,
unstoppable, undefeatable,
incredibly tough military
organization in the history of
mankind. More than once before,
the U.S. was sure the NVA would
not risk what little it had, and
capitulate, either through
surrender or negotiation; each
time, the NVA risked all and
almost completely reversed its
position, from losing to winning.
And it might happen again.
They'll definitely try. If they
cause the present operations to
fail (the U.S. can't see how; but
they didn't see how before,
either); then the U.S. will find its
position completely undermined,
only supportable by the
alternative of escalation (invasion
and bombing of NV; use of
nuclear weapons, etc.) That is
why I'm concerned. If the NVA
and VC risk all and pull through,
then the U.S. will be on its last
heels in the prosecution of the
War in Indochina.

If, and only if, this reversal
occurs (there are many
precedents), all Hell will break
loose: the force of events will
dictate the powers that be to
escalate up to Armageddon. At
this point, the people of this
country and of all others directly
or indirectly involved in the
Indochina War must, in all means
effective and direct, persuade the
U.S. and its allies to accept defeat
of its purposes and intentions- to
lose. There's always a first time; if
events dictate the choice between
