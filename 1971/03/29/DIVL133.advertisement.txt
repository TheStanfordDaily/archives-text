THE WALTER J. GORES
FACULTY ACHIEVEMENT AWARDS
Students, Staff, and Faculty of Stanford University Are Invited
To Recommend Recipients of the Awards for Excellence in Teaching
THE AWARDS
These awards for excellence in teaching were established by bequest of Walter J. Gores, a
Stanford alumnus, Class of 1917, and professor at the University of Michigan for 30
years. Teaching is understood in its broadest sense and includes, in particular, lecturing,
leading discussions, tutoring, and advising at the undergraduate, graduate, or professional
levels. Other contributions to excellence in teaching —for example, the design of new
courses —will also be considered as bases for the awards.
Each award is accompanied by a grant of $1,000. No more than four and normally three
awards will be made each year.
ELIGIBILITY
Any member of the teaching staff of the University is eligible for an award. This includes
all faculty of professorial rank, instructors, lecturers, teaching fellows, and teaching and
course assistants. Normally, each year at least one award will be made in each of the
categories: Teaching Fellows and Assistants, Junior Faculty, and Senior Faculty.
SELECTION
Selection of recipients of the award will be made by the Committee on Awards, Prizes,
and Honors of the Academic Council. The selection process will be initiated by recom
mendations from students, staff, and faculty. These recommendations will serve as a
guide for the Committee's choice of a panel of candidates for intensive consideration. For
these candidates the Committee will seek as full information as possible about their
teaching —for example, by interviews of faculty, staff, and students associated with the
candidates. Final selection will be made from among these candidates on the basis of all
information obtained.
IMPORTANT
Forms for recommendation of recipients of the award will be provided for students in
their Spring Quarter registration packets, and for faculty and staff in their University mail
boxes. Additional forms will be available from departmental offices and in the lobby of
the Old Union. Completed forms should be returned to the lobby of the Old Union by
the end of the second week of Spring Quarter.
The solicitation of recommendations should in no way be considered as a poll or voting
procedure. As a corollary, persons should recommend as many teachers as they believe
merit the awards. This is especially desirable since reasons for recommendations and not
mere nominations will be considered, and also because several awards will be made each
year.
