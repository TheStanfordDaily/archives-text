What kind of world
are you inheriting ?
A world full of problems? Or ;i life full of promise?
It all depends on you, and how you approach
your life.
If you look at things from a strictly materialistic
point of view, you may be discouraged.
But the greatest achievements have usually been
made by those who approached life from a
spiritual basis, with a firm conviction in the power
and the goodness of God.
