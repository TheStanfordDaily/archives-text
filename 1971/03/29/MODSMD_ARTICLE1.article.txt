# Race, Sex Bias Continues

Many basic structural changes are needed to combat
rising drop-out rates, costs, rigidity and uniformity in the
nations colleges and universities according to a recently
released report on higher education.
Headed by Frank Newman, associate director of
university relations here, the report task force struck out at
black admissions policies and discrimination against women
in higher education.
The report stated that despite highly publicized
recruitment efforts, black students still comprise an average

of only three percent of total enrollment in predominantly
white colleges and universities.
"The impression has sometimes been created that
colleges are overcommitted to minorities and that quotas of
10 to 22 percent are common," the report noted. "Yet, in
fact, "blacks as a percent of total enrollment are barely
holding thier own."
Census reports show that black enrollment as a
percentage of the national total actually declined between
1 964 and 1966, and has risen "very gradually, since then.
Lower Than Figures Show
The report added that other studies that have been made
show that black enrollment may be lower than these figures
indicate. While different admissions standards clearly have
been used for admission of some minority students, the
report continued, "there is little or no evidence of any
change in degree standards."
The report conclusions coincided with the Stanford BSU
demands presented last month. In these demands, the BSU
called for the formation of a committee of Black
administrators, faculty, and students to be "immediately
established to screen, accept, or reject all Black applicants."
The Newman report also suggested that "most minority
student programs, through recruiting, tutoring, counseling
etc., attempt to adapt the minority student to conventional
colleges. More ingenuity and effort must go into
experimenting tith varying forms of education that adapt
college to the minority student. New kinds of inner-city
institutions must be created with special curriculum and
faculty. One potential new approach to supplement
conventional colleges may be greater use of television
coupled with neighborhood tutoring centers . . . ."
Sexist Discrimination
The report also charged that discrimination against
women in higher education is still overt, and urged that
"women should be admitted to all levels of academic study
in all fields on a equal basis with men."

Comparisons of the participation and attainments of
men and women in higher education reveal a clearly
unequal pattern, the report said. Although in high school,
women earn better grades and have higher test scores than
men, fewer enter college, and they attain only 41.5 percent
of the bachelors and professional degrees. Although women
in college earn better undergraduate records than men,
fewer enter graduate school. Also, most of the degrees
earned by women are in a few fields of study, such as
education, the humanities, and the health professions. Thus
aggregate figures on attainment of women exaggerate their
opportunities in higher education.
Even within those fields considered acceptable, women
are confined to subordinate functions. While virtually all
the nursing graduates are women, they represent only eight
percent of graduating physicians.
Old Arguments Are False
Countering the argument that women's education is a
poor investment, the report said: "The facts tend to
contradict the view that women are poorer risks than men
in their disposition to complete training. The percentage of
entering undergraduate students who graduate in four years
is about 15 percent higher for women than for men. As for
graduate students, the record for completion is so poor for
male students in the fields of humanities and social
sciences, the fields most open to women, the report
concluded that it is absurd to make comparisons
unfavorable to women.
The task force said that higher education should "lead
the effort to understand and rethink the role of women in
American society," not only through specific institutional
changes but also through "subtle but fundamental changes
in attitudes."
The report warned that "without major reforms, simply
expanding the present system will not provide meaningful
education for the ever broader spectrum of students gaining
entrance" to college.

Stating that "the college degree plays too large a role in
American lite, the report railed for "eliminating the
monopoly on degree-granting of our conventional colleges"
by torming new Regional Examining Universities, similar to
Great Britian s National Council for Academic Awards.
It also recommended:
(/hanging undergraduate and graduate admissions
policies to favor students with experience outside the
formal "lock step" of education.

state sources to individual students, combined with cost of
education allowances to the institutions they choose to
attend.
—Using the project grant nioihod of funding nt the state
level for a "significant portion" of the costs of higher
education-perhaps as much as one-third.
—Adding representatives of the public interest to
established accrediting organizations.
—Establishing regional television colleges to strengthen
this educational medium.
—Reorienting community colleges to meet the specific
needs of the students, instead of patterning them after
four-year institutions.

—Creating professional institutes devoted to training for
human service, emphasizing work-study programs.
—Shifting the emphasis on graduate education"to train
more "doers than researchers," emphasizing skills and
attitudes needed for serving society rather than
perpetuating a professional discipline.
—Creating new research universities devoted to the
generation of new knowledge and specialized graduate
education, without the diversions of football teams or
campus newspapers.
"There should not fcx' a single order of excellence in
higher education," the report said. "We need a variety of
institutions, each excellent in its own appointed mission."
