# Tribe Victory
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball
team went all the way to
Riverside to win its first National
Intercollegiate tournament of the
year Saturday. The Indians
boosted their record to 18-9-1 for
the season in posting six wins
against only two setbacks in the
week-long tourney.
The Cards defeated a surprised
and favored Arizona State nine in
the championship game, 7-5. With
two outs in the top of the ninth
inning and trailing 5-1, the
Stanford batsmen came alive and
rallied with six runs to overtake
the hapless Sun Devils.
Rod Boone provided the initial
thunder by doubling in two runs.
But it was Kevin Cronin who
swatted the game-winning two-run
single that put the Indians ahead
to stay.
Dan Shaw worked the first
eight innings allowing five runs.
Bob Dipietro relieved Shaw in the
final inning to preserve Stanford's
two-run win.
On Saturday, the Cards also
lambasted Brigham Young, 14-4,

to reach the finals. Behind a
15-hit attack, Bob Marshall gave
up four runs on ten hits to garner
the victory. Each team made three
errors.
After Stanford's opening win
of the tourney over Kansas State
on Monday, the Tribe downed
Oklahoma, 12-3. Dan Shaw hurled
a complete game surrendering ten
hits but only one earned run. First
baseman Mark Lucich highlighted
the action with a 400 -foot
eighth-inning home run.
On Wednesday, the Cards
dropped two games, 5-3 to UC
Riverside and 13-3 to Arizona
State.
Thursday saw the Indians come
back with a 14-4 triumph over Air
Force. Trailing 3-1 in the fifth,
the Cards socked in four tallies in
the fifth and seven more in
seventh to ice the game. Bruce
Schoen picked up the win.
In Friday's action, Indian
pitcher Bob Kammeyer won his
fourth season victory allowing
only three earned runs on eight
hits in leading Stanford to a 10-5
win over Oregon State.
