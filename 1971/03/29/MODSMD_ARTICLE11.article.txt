New Dean Of Education
Arthur F. Coladarci, associate Dean of the School of
Education and Director of the Stanford International
Development Education Center, has been appointed new
Dean of the School of Education.
One of Coladarci's first actions was the establishment of
a "Eutures" committee which will study strengths and
weaknesses of the school and make suggestions for
improvement.
"This could well be the most important study made in
the history of the school," Coladarchi stated.
Coladarchi has been acting dean of the school since
September.
Stanford Peace Officers?
Referring to the Stanford police as "super security
guards and half-baked police," Stanford Police Chief Tom
Bell last week urged that University officials reach a
decision on proposals for granting peace officer status to
the Stanford force.
The Stanford police can now make only citizen's arrests.
They handle misdemeanors, but turn all felony cases over
to the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department.
The university is reluctant to adopt a number of plans
which would require Stanford to relinquish control of its
force to another agency which could grant the police peace
officer status.
Stanford police could gain full law enforcement powers
if the campus were annexed by Palo Alto, if a special police
district were created, or if they were deputized by the
Sheriff's department. The University would lose control of
the force in any of these cases. Bell favors the enactment of

legislation which would allow the University to have its
own full-fledged peace officers.
"With proper authority and equipment we could handle
law enforcement better than the sheriff because we are
more familiar with the area, we live here, we know the
people, and we take an interest in the area," Bell said.
Jane Fonda To Speak
Actress and anti-war activist Jane Fonda will speak at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium tonight at 8:00 p.m. Fonda is
expected to discuss the CI peace movement and the signing
of a "people's peace treaty" with North Vietnam. The East
Bay Sharks, a street theater group, and the San Francisco
Mine Troups will also perform.
Admission will be $1.50.
Day Care Center
The Children's Center of the Stanford Community
(CCSC) is alive and active at its location in the old Stanford
Elementary School on Mayfield and Santa Teresa. CCSC
offers two independent programs of child care: the Day
Care Program for two and a half five year-olds; and the
Drop-in Program designed for infants zero-one year and
toddlers one-three years.
The Day Care Program, operated from 7 :30 a.m. to 5 :30
p.m., benefits the whole community with particular
emphasis on low-income families because the monthly fee is
based on ability to pay.
Fellowships Awarded
Four Stanford students have been awarded graduate
fellowships which will lead to careers in college teaching.
Three students awarded Danforth fellowships were
Tanya Cobbs, a senior majoring in French, Daniel C. Snell,
a senior in humanities special programs and a former Daily
editor, and Scott Soames, a special student in philosophy
and a former Volunteers in Asia worker.
Soames was also awarded the Woodrow Wilson
Fellowship, along with Paul Sherman, a senior Biology
major.
Named To Group
President Richard Lyman was recently listed as a
member of the newly-formed Council for Policy
Evaluation, a private group of leaders in academics, law,
labor, and industry. The council will attempt to provide the
public with a better understanding of economic factors that
underlie the issues of pollution control, education, and
health care.
