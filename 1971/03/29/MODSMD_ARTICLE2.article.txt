# Lyman Formally Cites Franklin; Supporters, Critics Sign Petitions
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In the most recent of the tumultous
events concerning Associate English
professor H. Bruce Franklin. President
Richard Lyman last Tuesday filed
formal charges against Franklin before
the Advisory Board.
Lyman also announced Monday the
selection of attorneys William Norris
and Raymond Fisher, of the Los
Angeles law firm Tuttle & Taylor, to
represent the University in the hearing.
Franklin is charged with conducting
himself "in ways which have threatened
injury to persons and property, which
have denied others their right of free
speech and peaceful assembly, and

which have significantly impaired the
functions of this Ui iversity."
The case against Franklin is the first
of its kind in the University's history.
Related Events
In related events during finals week
and vacation:
—The preliminary injunction sought
by Stanford was granted March 10 by
Judge Richard W. Rhodes of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court. One
clause in the injunction bars Franklin,
.six suspended students, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, except to gather
evidence and attend disciplinary
hearings.
—Nearly 400 faculty members
March 11 signed an open letter to
Lyman in support of his efforts to
obtain the injunction and to run the
University "by rational and objective
consideration of the facts and issues
without prejudicial coercion."
—About 90 undergraduates in three
English courses petitioned Lyman to
rescind Franklin's suspension, labelling
the suspension without a hearing, "an
unnecessary and dangerous act."
—A petition to Lyman also
requesting Franklin's reinstatement is
currently being circulated to all
members of the Academic Council.

Franklin requested his Advisory
Board hearing just prior to the March
12 deadline. In a scathing letter to
Lyman, he protested the "obviously
prejudicial conditions" surrounding the
hearing and charged tha the Advisory
Board receives "a steady stream of lies,
misrepresentations and half-truths from
your News Service."
The letter also questioned Franklin's
ability to gather evidence in preparing
his case, as he is banned from the
principal academic campus.

In answer, and in accordance with
the provisions of a court order, then-
Acting President William Miller notified
Franklin that he could come on the
campus "on any days which you
propose between the hours of one and
six p.m."
"If this arrangement substantially
interferes with the preparation of your
case please so inform the President and,
if he agrees, alternative arrangements
may be made," the letter continued.
