# Lyman Formally Cites Franklin; Supporters, Critics Sign Petitions
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
In the most recent of the tumultous
events concerning Associate English
professor H. Bruce Franklin. President
Richard Lyman last Tuesday filed
formal charges against Franklin before
the Advisory Board.
Lyman also announced Monday the
selection of attorneys William Norris
and Raymond Fisher, of the Los
Angeles law firm Tuttle & Taylor, to
represent the University in the hearing.
Franklin is charged with conducting
himself "in ways which have threatened
injury to persons and property, which
have denied others their right of free
speech and peaceful assembly, and

which have significantly impaired the
functions of this Ui iversity."
The case against Franklin is the first
of its kind in the University's history.
Related Events
In related events during finals week
and vacation:
—The preliminary injunction sought
by Stanford was granted March 10 by
Judge Richard W. Rhodes of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court. One
clause in the injunction bars Franklin,
.six suspended students, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, except to gather
evidence and attend disciplinary
hearings.
—Nearly 400 faculty members
March 11 signed an open letter to
Lyman in support of his efforts to
obtain the injunction and to run the
University "by rational and objective
consideration of the facts and issues
without prejudicial coercion."
—About 90 undergraduates in three
English courses petitioned Lyman to
rescind Franklin's suspension, labelling
the suspension without a hearing, "an
unnecessary and dangerous act."
—A petition to Lyman also
requesting Franklin's reinstatement is
currently being circulated to all
members of the Academic Council.

Franklin requested his Advisory
Board hearing just prior to the March
12 deadline. In a scathing letter to
Lyman, he protested the "obviously
prejudicial conditions" surrounding the
hearing and charged tha the Advisory
Board receives "a steady stream of lies,
misrepresentations and half-truths from
your News Service."
The letter also questioned Franklin's
ability to gather evidence in preparing
his case, as he is banned from the
principal academic campus.

In answer, and in accordance with
the provisions of a court order, then-
Acting President William Miller notified
Franklin that he could come on the
campus "on any days which you
propose between the hours of one and
six p.m."
"If this arrangement substantially
interferes with the preparation of your
case please so inform the President and,
if he agrees, alternative arrangements
may be made," the letter continued.

Accepting the offer, Franklin noted
"Until receiving a fair opportunity to
prepare myself, 1 will come on campus
to gather evidence during the hours of
one and six p.m. every day when
lunchtime conferences are impossible
and while people needed to help are
least available."
In addition, Franklin formally
requested that his suspension by the
President be revoked "because my
attorney advises that it is necessary to
exhaust all possible administrative
remedies before seeking civil remedy."
'Hie injunction which bars Franklin
and 1 .'1 others from campus also enjoins
named individuals from committing a
series of destructive or disruptive acts
listed in a temporary restraining order
issued Feb. 12. 1,000 John Does all
prohibited from aiding and abetting the
defendants in committing these acts.
Judge Rhodes noted that "this order
does not prohibit peaceful and orderly
picketing or the peaceful and orderly
advocacy of a voluntary boycott of
University functions or activities."
Lyman, in a KZSU broadcast March
11, declared that the court order "will
not be used by the University in
manner that would interfere with
lawful, nondisruptive political activity.
"An injunction is not a remedy that
should be lightly sought, lightly
granted, or frivolously or maliciously
used," said Lyman.

The faculty petition currently
circulating asks that Franklin be
reinstated as his suspension "in no
wa>" serves "the interest of the
university."
"It may indeed constitute a
violation of academic freedom the
petition continues, since a professor is
being unnecessarily prevented from
teaching prior to a hearing by the
Advisory Board and because of activity
outside the classroom," the petition
continues.
"Because the suspension harms
rather than serves the university's
interests, we, the undersigned members
of the Academic Council, petition you
to lift the suspension of Professor
Franklin," concludes the petition.
Open Letter
By contrast, the open letter whose
faculty signers are headed by Biology-
Professors Colin Pittendrigh and Peter
Ray, stated that "we wish persuasion
and rules against disruption,
destruction, and violence, were
sufficient to deter those who are
inclined toward these evils.
"But what has happened on campus
shows that this is not the case . . .
"Therefore we support you ... in
acting to obtain . . . legal relief from,
and protection for the University
against these evils and the persons
perpetuating them."
Pittendrigh stated he felt that "the
point has been made that President

Lyman has a very large body of support
behind him."

Felony charges against Franklin
stemming from a Jan. 25

consideration of the facts and issues
without prejudicial coercion."
—About 90 undergraduates in three
English courses petitioned Lyman to
rescind Franklin's suspension, labelling
the suspension without a hearing, "an
unnecessary and dangerous act."
—A petition to Lyman also
requesting Franklin's reinstatement is
currently being circulated to all
members of the Academic Council.

Franklin requested his Advisory
Board hearing just prior to the March
12 deadline. In a scathing letter to
Lyman, he protested the "obviously
prejudicial conditions" surrounding the
hearing and charged tha the Advisory
Board receives "a steady stream of lies,
misrepresentations and half-truths from
your News Service."
The letter also questioned Franklin's
ability to gather evidence in preparing
his case, as he is banned from the
principal academic campus.

In answer, and in accordance with
the provisions of a court order, then-
Acting President William Miller notified
Franklin that he could come on the
campus "on any days which you
propose between the hours of one and
six p.m."
"If this arrangement substantially
interferes with the preparation of your
case please so inform the President and,
if he agrees, alternative arrangements
may be made," the letter continued.

Accepting the offer, Franklin noted
"Until receiving a fair opportunity to
prepare myself, 1 will come on campus
to gather evidence during the hours of
one and six p.m. every day when
lunchtime conferences are impossible
and while people needed to help are
least available."
In addition, Franklin formally
requested that his suspension by the
President be revoked "because my
attorney advises that it is necessary to
exhaust all possible administrative
remedies before seeking civil remedy."
'Hie injunction which bars Franklin
and 1 .'1 others from campus also enjoins
named individuals from committing a
series of destructive or disruptive acts
listed in a temporary restraining order
issued Feb. 12. 1,000 John Does all
prohibited from aiding and abetting the
defendants in committing these acts.
Judge Rhodes noted that "this order
does not prohibit peaceful and orderly
picketing or the peaceful and orderly
advocacy of a voluntary boycott of
University functions or activities."
Lyman, in a KZSU broadcast March
11, declared that the court order "will
not be used by the University in
manner that would interfere with
lawful, nondisruptive political activity.
"An injunction is not a remedy that
should be lightly sought, lightly
granted, or frivolously or maliciously
used," said Lyman.

The faculty petition currently
circulating asks that Franklin be
reinstated as his suspension "in no
wa>" serves "the interest of the
university."
"It may indeed constitute a
violation of academic freedom the
petition continues, since a professor is
being unnecessarily prevented from
teaching prior to a hearing by the
Advisory Board and because of activity
outside the classroom," the petition
continues.
"Because the suspension harms
rather than serves the university's
interests, we, the undersigned members
of the Academic Council, petition you
to lift the suspension of Professor
Franklin," concludes the petition.

prepare myself, 1 will come on campus
to gather evidence during the hours of
one and six p.m. every day when
lunchtime conferences are impossible
and while people needed to help are
least available."
In addition, Franklin formally
requested that his suspension by the
President be revoked "because my
attorney advises that it is necessary to
exhaust all possible administrative
remedies before seeking civil remedy."
'Hie injunction which bars Franklin
and 1 .'1 others from campus also enjoins
named individuals from committing a
series of destructive or disruptive acts
listed in a temporary restraining order
issued Feb. 12. 1,000 John Does all
prohibited from aiding and abetting the
defendants in committing these acts.
Judge Rhodes noted that "this order
does not prohibit peaceful and orderly
picketing or the peaceful and orderly
advocacy of a voluntary boycott of
University functions or activities."
Lyman, in a KZSU broadcast March
11, declared that the court order "will
not be used by the University in
manner that would interfere with
lawful, nondisruptive political activity.
"An injunction is not a remedy that
should be lightly sought, lightly
granted, or frivolously or maliciously
used," said Lyman.

The faculty petition currently
circulating asks that Franklin be
reinstated as his suspension "in no
wa>" serves "the interest of the
university."
"It may indeed constitute a
violation of academic freedom the
petition continues, since a professor is
being unnecessarily prevented from
teaching prior to a hearing by the
Advisory Board and because of activity
outside the classroom," the petition
continues.
"Because the suspension harms
rather than serves the university's
interests, we, the undersigned members
of the Academic Council, petition you
to lift the suspension of Professor
Franklin," concludes the petition.
Open Letter
By contrast, the open letter whose
faculty signers are headed by Biology-
Professors Colin Pittendrigh and Peter
Ray, stated that "we wish persuasion
and rules against disruption,
destruction, and violence, were
sufficient to deter those who are
inclined toward these evils.
"But what has happened on campus
shows that this is not the case . . .
"Therefore we support you ... in
acting to obtain . . . legal relief from,
and protection for the University
against these evils and the persons
perpetuating them."
Pittendrigh stated he felt that "the
point has been made that President

Lyman has a very large body of support
behind him."

court; Gerry Foote, Michael Holman,
Merle Rabine, Theresa Ramirez, and
Janet Weiss.
Nonstudents banned until such time
as they become registered students:

Felony charges against Franklin
stemming from a Jan. 25
demonstration in Redwood City in
support of Los Siete were reduced to
misdemeanors in a court decision last
Friday.
He now faces misdemeanor charges
of assault and battery, assault and
battery on a policeman, and resisting or
obstructing a policeman. A hearing on
the charges has been set for Friday at
9:3 0 a.m.
Commenting on the surprise
reduction of charges, Franklin said, "1
get beat up by a pig on a public
street—then they tell be they're going
to go easy on me for getting beat up.
What am I supposed to say, 'Gee, that's
great!'?"
In the most recent of the tumultous
events concerning Associate English
professor H. Bruce Franklin. President
Richard Lyman last Tuesday filed
formal charges against Franklin before
the Advisory Board.
Lyman also announced Monday the
selection of attorneys William Norris
and Raymond Fisher, of the Los
Angeles law firm Tuttle & Taylor, to
represent the University in the hearing.
Franklin is charged with conducting
himself "in ways which have threatened
injury to persons and property, which
have denied others their right of free
speech and peaceful assembly, and

which have significantly impaired the
functions of this Ui iversity."
The case against Franklin is the first
of its kind in the University's history.
Related Events
In related events during finals week
and vacation:
—The preliminary injunction sought
by Stanford was granted March 10 by
Judge Richard W. Rhodes of the Santa
Clara County Superior Court. One
clause in the injunction bars Franklin,
.six suspended students, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, and seven
non-students from the principal
academic campus, except to gather
evidence and attend disciplinary
hearings.
—Nearly 400 faculty members
March 11 signed an open letter to
Lyman in support of his efforts to
obtain the injunction and to run the
University "by rational and objective
consideration of the facts and issues
without prejudicial coercion."
—About 90 undergraduates in three
English courses petitioned Lyman to
rescind Franklin's suspension, labelling
the suspension without a hearing, "an
unnecessary and dangerous act."
—A petition to Lyman also
requesting Franklin's reinstatement is
currently being circulated to all
members of the Academic Council.

Franklin requested his Advisory
Board hearing just prior to the March
12 deadline. In a scathing letter to
Lyman, he protested the "obviously
prejudicial conditions" surrounding the
hearing and charged tha the Advisory
Board receives "a steady stream of lies,
misrepresentations and half-truths from
your News Service."
The letter also questioned Franklin's
ability to gather evidence in preparing
his case, as he is banned from the
principal academic campus.

In answer, and in accordance with
the provisions of a court order, then-
Acting President William Miller notified
Franklin that he could come on the
campus "on any days which you
propose between the hours of one and
six p.m."
"If this arrangement substantially
interferes with the preparation of your
case please so inform the President and,
if he agrees, alternative arrangements
may be made," the letter continued.
