# Militant Student Weapons Buildup Reported By Santa Clara Sheriff
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
The Santa Clara County Sheriff
defended the expediture of over
$20,000 for campus riot and crowd
control between January 28 and
February 12 because of an alleged
build-up of a massive weapons arsenal
by militant Stanford students.
Speaking before the Santa Clara
County supervisors on March 16,
Sheriff James Geary said that the
arsenal, which is either in a cache or
spread around the campus, consists of
hand grenades, semi-automatic
weapons, a sniper rifle, thousands of
rounds of ammunition, and possibly
machineguns.
In subsequent interviews, Geary has
denied the presence of such an arsenal
on campus, and has pointed out that
the possession of firearms is not
necessarily illegal. "It's not illegal to
purchase or possess firearms," he said.
"If we went house to house and found
guns we couldn't do anything about it
anyway."
Nevertheless, Geary termed the arms
build-up as hazardous to Santa Clara
deputies, and told the supervisors that
instead of being short-handed in a
critical situation, he was going to send
enough men to Stanford riots and
incidents to "dominate the situation."
He illustrated the financial
consequences of the policy as he
defended the expenditure of $21,769
in deputy pay including $16,731 in
overtime, during a two week period.
Conversion Kit
Geary explained that the weapons
are purchased at gun shows, and that
although a handful of gun salesmen
have been arrested in the past few
weeks, many firearms have simply not
been accounted for. He also disclosed
that a number of people identified as
students have also attempted to
purchase conversion kits which would
change carbines from semi- to
fully-automatic weapons.
Original accounts of Geary's
appearance before the supervisors
indicated that a search was being

conducted for various weapons. But the
sheriff partially discounted this report,
saying "there will be no house to house
search."
When asked of his knowledge of the
weapons reports, Stanford Police Chief
Thomas Bell said flatly that he had no
information. "It's no secret that lots of
people have been buying guns for lots
of different reasons. But we haven't
been contacted by Geary to be on the
look-out, and we hr.ve no knowledge of
the existence of guns of any sort on
campus."
Long Time Gone
Bell explained that he would pursue
violators of the campus firearms policy
if complaints were made, but added
that "it's been a long time since an
arrest was made."
James Zurcher, the new Palo Alto
police chief said that his department
would look into the matter, but only if
requested to do so by the Santa Clara
sheriffs. He also acknowledged that the
increasing gun sales concern him, but
no immediate action is planned.
Shortly after his appointment,
Zurcher expressed a desire to discuss
with university officials, the possibility
of bringing the Stanford campus under
the jurisdiction of his department. The
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department presently handles all
campus felonies and handles civil
disorders on the request of University
officials.
University 'Concerned'
The only official university response
to Geary's revelation came from
Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig
who said:
"The University is, of course, deeply
concerned about the reported presence
in the area of large quantities of lethal
weapons.
"It has long been University policy
to prohibit the possession of guns in
University residences. That remains our
policy and we have no information
from the sheriff or elsewhere that
suggests that the weapons to which he
referred are being stored on campus.
"We will continue to work closely

with Sheriff Geary and extend him our
full cooperation.
"Every purchase of weapons and
ammunition from the recent gun show
was apparently made legally, although
it is hard to imagine a legitimate use for
the kind and quantity of arms
purchases which he reported to the
board."
