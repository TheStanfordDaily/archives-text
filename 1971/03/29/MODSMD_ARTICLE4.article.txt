# Keilch Verdict Sparks Vandalism
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
John Keilch, cataloguing assistant in the Main
Library, began serving a 45-day suspension from his
job, without pay, on March 15. The suspension
results from his participation in the Lodge disruption
incident Jan. 11,
The action was announced by Provost William F.
Miller on March 12, following recommendation of the
majority report of a three-man committee appointed
to review the case.
Keilch supporters have struck back through a
harassment campaign aimed at the library. Vandalism
in the Main Library in the past two weeks has
resulted in immediate damages of $1 2,000 to
$1 5,000 according to Library Director David Weber.
The incidents involved defacing and mutilation of
books, physical damage to the building and "most
significant," Weber said, vandalism of the main card
catalog file.
"Although the dollar costs are significant," he
said, "the real costs to the Stanford community will
be the loss of time and energy of scholars in
attempting to use the maimed card catalog. It may be
years before the full extent of the disruption is
known."
Slogans Cover Cards
So far, library officials believe at least 11,000
cards have been removed, and nearly 9,000 of them
have been found scattered throughout the building.
Half have been torn, stained with ink, or defaced with
such slogans as "Reinstate Keilch," "5,000 cards a
day until John is rehired," and "Down with Weber."
'Hie categories involved included "Business,"
"Corporation," "Currency," "Economics,"
"Industry, Industrial," and "Henry Cabot Lodge."
Weber informed Keilch last month that he was
suspended for 90 days, but imposition of the penally
was postponed pending completion of grievance

procedures. After lengthy hearings, the majority of
the review committee reported the penalty might
cause undue hardship but that a suspension was
appropriate.
Split Vote
The committee was divided with George T.
Gregory, University legal counsel, appointed by
President Richard Lyman and Dr. Robert C. Lindee, a
dean of the medical school, appointed by Weber
voting for the suspension and James Berk, electronics
engineer at SLAC, appointed by Keilch, voting
against.
Provost Miller agreed with the majority that a
one-year warning period after suspension was
"superflous" but added in a letter informing Keilch
of the action: "If this (45-day) sanction does not
serve to deter like conduct in the future, I think
dismissal would be appropriate."
Berk quoted Keilch as saying he participated in the
demonstration against Lodge, "heckling his speech,
preventing his speech, expressing our disgust for
him." Berk also quoted Keilch as saying: "I'm glad
that war criminal Lodge wasn't allowed to speak
freely on this campus."
In a minority opinion, Berk concluded that the
Policy on Campus Disruptions should not govern an
employee's conduct at the University when he is not
in performance of his duties arguing that such cases
should be referred to the civil or criminal courts.
Same Rules for Everyone
Provost Miller disagreed, saying that, "Employees
are members of the Stanford community, and as such
are bound to the niles of that community."
Earlier this month, acting on recommendations of
the University Judicial Council, President Lyman
suspended seven students for their part in the Lodge
incident.

Provost Miller emphasized in the letter to Keilch
that: "It is not my intention, nor is it President
Lyman's, that staff or any others be in any way
frustrated in their efforts to be heard, to hear, or to
act out their political views in peaceful and
non-coercive ways. Should we abandon those rights,
we will have turned the University over to whoever
can assemble the loudest claque. This we will not
do."
On March 12, 50 people presented Provost Miller
with a petition supporting Keilch, signed by more
than 100 individuals. The group picketed the Main
Library most of the day.
Continued Vandalism
On several occasions since the announcement of
the suspension, library books have been left in the
aisles and on study desks, or misplaced on the shelves.
About 2,000 books have been involved in these
incidents.
A dozen books were defaced by a sticky
substance, apparently honey, on March 15. The next
evening, three dozen books were found covered with
ink. Threats were written inside some of the books
and on some of the library walls: "Either John gets
his job back or . . ."
A false fire alarm was turned in from a box in the
library basement at 8:06 p.m. on March 16. Fireman
found a note attached to the box reading; "Reinstate
John Keilch."
A bomb threat was received on the afternoon of
March 17, indicating that an explosive had been
planted in a drawer of the main card catalog. The
building was evacuated, but no bomb was found.
On March 19, the locks on all the Main Library
doors were filled with solder.
Weber said surveillance of the area has resulted in
"identification of at least a few culprits."

voting for the suspension and James Berk, electronics
engineer at SLAC, appointed by Keilch, voting
against.
Provost Miller agreed with the majority that a
one-year warning period after suspension was
"superflous" but added in a letter informing Keilch
of the action: "If this (45-day) sanction does not
serve to deter like conduct in the future, I think
dismissal would be appropriate."
Berk quoted Keilch as saying he participated in the
demonstration against Lodge, "heckling his speech,
preventing his speech, expressing our disgust for
him." Berk also quoted Keilch as saying: "I'm glad
that war criminal Lodge wasn't allowed to speak
freely on this campus."
In a minority opinion, Berk concluded that the
Policy on Campus Disruptions should not govern an
employee's conduct at the University when he is not
in performance of his duties arguing that such cases
should be referred to the civil or criminal courts.
Same Rules for Everyone
Provost Miller disagreed, saying that, "Employees
are members of the Stanford community, and as such
are bound to the niles of that community."
Earlier this month, acting on recommendations of
the University Judicial Council, President Lyman
suspended seven students for their part in the Lodge
incident.

Provost Miller emphasized in the letter to Keilch
that: "It is not my intention, nor is it President
Lyman's, that staff or any others be in any way
frustrated in their efforts to be heard, to hear, or to
act out their political views in peaceful and
non-coercive ways. Should we abandon those rights,
we will have turned the University over to whoever
can assemble the loudest claque. This we will not
do."
On March 12, 50 people presented Provost Miller
with a petition supporting Keilch, signed by more
than 100 individuals. The group picketed the Main
Library most of the day.
Continued Vandalism
On several occasions since the announcement of
the suspension, library books have been left in the
aisles and on study desks, or misplaced on the shelves.
About 2,000 books have been involved in these
incidents.
A dozen books were defaced by a sticky
substance, apparently honey, on March 15. The next
evening, three dozen books were found covered with
ink. Threats were written inside some of the books
and on some of the library walls: "Either John gets
his job back or . . ."
A false fire alarm was turned in from a box in the
library basement at 8:06 p.m. on March 16. Fireman
found a note attached to the box reading; "Reinstate
John Keilch."
A bomb threat was received on the afternoon of
March 17, indicating that an explosive had been
planted in a drawer of the main card catalog. The
building was evacuated, but no bomb was found.
On March 19, the locks on all the Main Library
doors were filled with solder.
Weber said surveillance of the area has resulted in
"identification of at least a few culprits."
John Keilch, cataloguing assistant in the Main
Library, began serving a 45-day suspension from his
job, without pay, on March 15. The suspension
results from his participation in the Lodge disruption
incident Jan. 11,
The action was announced by Provost William F.
Miller on March 12, following recommendation of the
majority report of a three-man committee appointed
to review the case.
Keilch supporters have struck back through a
harassment campaign aimed at the library. Vandalism
in the Main Library in the past two weeks has
resulted in immediate damages of $1 2,000 to
$1 5,000 according to Library Director David Weber.
The incidents involved defacing and mutilation of
books, physical damage to the building and "most
significant," Weber said, vandalism of the main card
catalog file.
"Although the dollar costs are significant," he
said, "the real costs to the Stanford community will
be the loss of time and energy of scholars in
attempting to use the maimed card catalog. It may be
years before the full extent of the disruption is
known."
Slogans Cover Cards
So far, library officials believe at least 11,000
cards have been removed, and nearly 9,000 of them
have been found scattered throughout the building.
Half have been torn, stained with ink, or defaced with
such slogans as "Reinstate Keilch," "5,000 cards a
day until John is rehired," and "Down with Weber."
'Hie categories involved included "Business,"
"Corporation," "Currency," "Economics,"
"Industry, Industrial," and "Henry Cabot Lodge."
Weber informed Keilch last month that he was
suspended for 90 days, but imposition of the penally
was postponed pending completion of grievance

procedures. After lengthy hearings, the majority of
the review committee reported the penalty might
cause undue hardship but that a suspension was
appropriate.
Split Vote
The committee was divided with George T.
Gregory, University legal counsel, appointed by
President Richard Lyman and Dr. Robert C. Lindee, a
dean of the medical school, appointed by Weber
voting for the suspension and James Berk, electronics
engineer at SLAC, appointed by Keilch, voting

A dozen books were defaced by a sticky
substance, apparently honey, on March 15. The next
evening, three dozen books were found covered with
ink. Threats were written inside some of the books
and on some of the library walls: "Either John gets
his job back or . . ."
A false fire alarm was turned in from a box in the
library basement at 8:06 p.m. on March 16. Fireman
found a note attached to the box reading; "Reinstate
John Keilch."
A bomb threat was received on the afternoon of
March 17, indicating that an explosive had been
planted in a drawer of the main card catalog. The
building was evacuated, but no bomb was found.
On March 19, the locks on all the Main Library
doors were filled with solder.
Weber said surveillance of the area has resulted in
"identification of at least a few culprits."
