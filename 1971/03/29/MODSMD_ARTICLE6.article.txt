# Arms Speaker
## 
### 
Dr. Jeremy Stone, the Director
of the Federation of American
Scientists, will speak tonight on
"Can the System Be Made to
Work?" The well-known
mathematician draws his views
from eight years experience as an
observer and analyst of the arms
race. He is expected to discuss the
ABM, MIRV, the SALT talks and
the broad questions of science and
society. He will speak at 8 p.m. in
the Physics Tank.
We're the Stanford Daily
Passport Photo Service. We'd like
to take your picture. Walk into
the Storke Student Publications
Bldg. any afternoon, Mon.â€”Fri.,
between one and three. We charge
$3.50 for twelve pictures. We
want to help you because you're
going overseas.
You're going to step in that
silver bird, strap on your seat belt,
try to con the stewardess into
selling you a bloody mary, and
pop some chewing gum. When
you set down you're going to
proceed to soak up as much
culture as you can absorb. Lucky
sponge! What we wouldn't give to
be going over there with you! Yes,
we've long wanted to see the
Eiffel Tower, pick off
motorcyclists on the autobahn
going a hundred miles an hour,
smoke hashish until our brains
turn to silly putty. We've longed
to do all those things. But, alas,
we cannot. We must stay here at
home, toiling that you may play.
Oh, don't feel sorry for us. Just
come in and have your picture
taken, damn it!
We open next Monday, April 5.
