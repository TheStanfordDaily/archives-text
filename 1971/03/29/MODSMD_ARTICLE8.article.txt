# Track Wins Three
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's track team has
moved out to one of its best starts
in recent years with three early
season dual meet wins over Fresno
State, Occidental, and San Jose
State. The three wins are two
more than they compiled last year
when they had a dismal 1 -8
record.
The Indians opened their
season on March 13 with an easy
double dual meet victory over
Fresno State (120-25) and
Occidental (109-35 ). They
followed these wins up with an
exciting 77-68 victory over 1969
NCAA Champion San Jose State
on March 2 0.
The San Jose State meet went
down to the final event, the mile
relay, but the Stanford team of
Tom Long, Pete Fairchild, Randy
White and Rick Tipton won easily
in 3:14.6.
On their way to defeating the
Spartans, the Cards established 9
lifetime bests. Among the better
marks were Don Kardong's 4 :03.9
mile, Jim Buser's 23-8 1/4 long
jump, and Rick Tipton's 13.8 in
the high hurdles, which tied his

All-Time Stanford mark. Tipton
could still only finish second to
the Spartan's George Carty who
was also timed in 13.8.
One of the major factors in the
Indians' win was their depth in
the sprints. Stanford has been
sorely undermanned in the sprints
in recent years, but the problem
seems to be ending. Even without
Ken Curl, who ran a 9.3 100 in
high school, Stanford won both
relays and finished 1-3 in the 220
and 2-3 in the 100, against a
school famous for its fine
sprinters.
Chuck Francis led the Card
sprin ters, winning the 220 in 21.6,
finishing second in the 100 in 9.6;
and anchoring the victorious 4 40
yard relay team which won in
41.3. Francis is the Canadian
national champion in both the
100 and 200 meters.
In their opener, the Indians
won 13 of 17 events. Steve Davis
won both the shot put (53-6 1/2)
and discus (163-9), while Francis
took both the 100 (9.7) and 220
(21.6). Sophomore Tom
Anderson was another double
winner in the long jump (25-1)
and high jump (6-6).
