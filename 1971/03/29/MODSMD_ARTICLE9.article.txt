Stanford's tennis team posted
its fifth straight dual meet victory
of the season Friday as the Tribe
demolished Oregon, 9-0. Relying
on his tremendous depth against
the Ducks, Coach Dick Gould
used five sophomores and two
freshmen in the romp.
Roscoe Tanner began the
scoring with an impressive 6-2,6-4
win over Jumbo Fernando. In the
second slot, Rick Fisher defeated
Phil Stevens 6-1, 6-3. Gerry
Groslimond aced Chris Anderson
6-0, 6-3 in the third match.
Freshman Paul Sidone downed
Brian Boucher 6-1, 6-1 in the
fourth spot. Rick Evans topped
Sam Kress 6-0, 6-0 in the fifth
singles. Frosh Tim Noonan sealed

the shut out in singles play with a
6-2,6-3 over Mark Weir.
In doubles, Sidone and Evans
defeated Fernando and Anderson
6-3, 7-5. At the second pairing,
Noonan and Greg Parker
overcame Stevens and Kress 6-3,
6-4. In the final doubles match,
sophs Wes Hampton and Jim
Healy outlasted Boucher and Weir
4-6,6-3,6-1.
At the Pacific Coast Doubles
Championships two weeks ago,
Tanner and frosh stalwart Alex
Mayer advanced to the
quarter-finals before falling to
UCLA's young tandem of Jimmy
Connors and Jeff Austin in
straight sets. Earlier, the Stanford
pair had posted an impressive win
over one of USC's top duos.

against Oregon last Friday. "Fish" playing second singles, teams with
fellow sophomore Gery Groslimond to give the Indians a tough
second doubles team.
