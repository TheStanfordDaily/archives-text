Today In The 'Daily 9
Two years ago today, Dwight D. Eisenhower, military hero
and two-term Republican president, lay in state in the Capitol
Building in Washington D.C. Today, war heros are hard to find,
and two-term Republican presidents are hopefully a thing of the
past, but Ike is not totally forgottenâ€”the military-industrial
complex lives on.
We're tired of news about wars and presidents, but anything
else is gladly accepted at x4632. If you have a complex, call up
our friendly business people at 327-4150. They'll take care of
you, and your money as well.
