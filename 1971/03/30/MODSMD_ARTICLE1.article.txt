# Basic Research Makes Incredible Laser Credible

### RICHARD B. MILES STEVEN G. UNGAR 
(This is pari one of a three part
series describing laser research at
Stanford. This first part gives a general
description of lasers and discusses
research in the Department of Physics.)
The laser burst upon the world in a
flash of ruby-red light a little more than
a decade ago, and in that time it has
established itself as one of the most
glamorous, and least understood, of
post World War II technological
developments.
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow was
one of the inventors of the laser when
he was working at the Bell Telephone
Laboratories in the 1950'5. According
to Professor Schawlow, who now
directs the laser research program in
Stanford's Department of Physics,
almost any material can be used to
make a laser:
"As one illustration of that," says
Dr. Schawlow, with a perfectly straight
face, "we've been able to make Jell-0
lase. We took some Knox gelatine and
added a little sodium fluoricine dye to
it, and then we pumped it with an
ultraviolet nitrogen laser, and, sure

enough, we got a green laser beam
coming out of it.
"Of course, this is partly interesting
as an illustration that you can indeed
make most anything lase, but it's also
interesting to note that this is perhaps
the world's first edible laser material,
because, according to the Merck Index,
the toxicity of sodium fluoricine is very
low.
"We're looking for a volunteer to try
it out."
Lasers to the People
Although Dr. Schawlow's work has
been largely devoted to serious research
in basic laser problems, he has not been
beyond bringing the laser to the people.
For instance, he has recently been
awarded a patent for a laser typewriter
eraser that literally zaps the letter off
of the page, without damaging the
paper.
To the layman, the laser is the
optical buzz-saw that almost bisected
James Bond in the movie 'Goldfinger,'
or the magic wand that welded Aunt
Mary's retina into place. To the
physicist the laser is a marvelous new
instrument that provides coherent
electromagnetic radiation at
frequencies previously unattainable.
The engineer looks to the laser for
advances in data storage, precision
alignments, and super-accurate
measurements. And the military looks
at all of these things.
Optical Echo Chamber
For all the mystery that seems to
surround it, the laser is really a simple
device to understand. Basically it is
nothing more that an echo chamber for
light. (The word "laser" is an acronym
for "Light Amplification by Stimulated
Emission of Radiation," which is based
on the fact that as the light beam
bounces or "echos" back and forth
within the laser, it "stimulates" further
emission of light by the lasing material,
and thus is amplified.)
The light that comes out of this
optical echo chamber has some very
special properties that make it unique.
It emerges as a narrow, directional
beam with a very "pure" (i.e. single
frequency) color. Thus the laser is
either "pure" red or "pure" blue; it
always has a particular color associated
with it. The light is also "coherent,"
which means that it can be focused to a
very small point and can be used for
information transmission, much as are
conventional radio waves.
Laser light, in general, is not
dangerous. If a laser beam shines on

your hand you can't even feel your skin
get warm. However, laser light can be
dangerous if it is allowed to shine
directly into the eye, which accounts
for the warning signs that are posted all
over laser laboratories.
High Energy
An exception to the general rule
that lasers are not dangerous is the high
energy continuous wave carbon
dioxide, or CO 2, laser. Carbon dioxide
lases in the infra-red region of the
spectrum. Infra-red is the "color" you
would see just before the burner of
your stove begins to glow red hot, if
your eyes were sensitive to this part of
the spectrum. Infra-red radiation is felt
as heat when it shines on your skin.
The CO 2 laser appears to be capable of
putting out an almost unlimited
amount of energy at this invisible color.
However, the CO 2 laser is unique in its
high energy output, most lasers being
very weak sources of light.
While a low energy CO 2 laser is
being built at Stanford for studying the
optical properties of certain materials,
there are no high-energy CO 2 lasers at
Stanford, and there are no plans to
build any or to acquire any.
Lasers in Physics
Dr. Schawlow heads one of three
major groups that are at present
actively engaged in laser research at
Stanford. Dr. Schawlow's group has
been doing high resolution laser
spectroscopy, a new method of
studying materials that has been made
possible by the development of lasers,
and which will become an even more
powerful tool in the near future when
tunable lasers (lasers whose color can
be changed, much as one changes the
station on a radio) become
commercially available.
Professor Schawlow, along with his
associates, Dr. Theodor W. Hansch and
Dr. Frank L. Varsanyi, has developed a
device that increases any image's
intensity several thousand times.
His group has also developed some
new and novel methods of constructing
tunable lasers, partly in conjunction
with the laser photography laboratory
of Mr. Matt Lehman and Professor
Joseph W. Goodman of the Department
of Electrical Engineering.
(Part two will explore the research
and the applications of the research
done at the Medical School and at the
Hansen Laboratories of Physics. See it
tomorrow in a glow of Jell-0 green
light, in The Stanford Daily J


BZZZAP!â€”Professor Arthur L. Schawlow, one of the inventors of the laser, demonstrates his personal lasser "ray
gun." Professor Schawlow uses the "gun" and the balloons to show how the laser beam passes through the light colored
outer balloon to burst the dark inner one.
