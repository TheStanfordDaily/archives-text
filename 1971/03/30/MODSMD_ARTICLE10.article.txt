# only reasonable solution to end the war
## Peace Treaty With The Vietnamese People 
### 
peace treaty collective

The failure of Richard Nixon's
latest gamble is complete. The
Laotian campaign has left the
South Vietnamese army (ARVN)
in a shambles, with casualties
amounting to over 50 percent of
the original invasion force. The
war-makers knew that this would
probably happen, all the time
claiming that the invasion was
"proceeding according to
schedule."
The situation for Nixon and his
puppets Thieu and Ky is
becoming more critical all the
time. Opposition to the
Thieu-KyNixon policies is
becoming more vocal in Saigon
itself. Jacques Decornoy,
Southeast Asian editor for Le
Monde, reports that newspapers
are printing articles and editorials
in the Saigon press which would
have been unthinkable even a year
ago. He says that the job of
government censorship is
becoming impossible because of
the volume of opposition.
Thus Nixon is faced with the

same old choice: escalate again or
get out. The problem is even more
critical now for Nixon than it was
for Lyndon Johnson after the Tet
Offensive in 1968. He has very
few possibilities for escalation. He
can mine Haiphong Harbor, and
thus infuriate the Soviets, because
that would destroy their ships in
the harbor. Or he can invade the
North, which would surely bring
the Chinese into the war. Or
finally, he could use tactical
nuclear weapons along the Ho Chi
Minh Trial in Laos and the DMZ
in Vietnam. This could also force
the Chinese into the war.
Therefore, it is crucial for us
here at home to force Nixon to
understand what we have known
for years. That he cannot win this
war, because neither we nor the
Vietnamese people support it. It is
essential that the American people
begin to make their peace with
the Vietnamese people now,
before Nixon escalates again. We
must educate people to
understand that the only

reasonable solution to end the war
is the Provisional Revolutionary
Government's peace proposal
which calls for total American
withdrawal, sets up the
framework for release of
American POWs, the creation of a
coalition government, and for
future free elections.
The People's Peace Treaty is a
good way to force Nixon to set a
final date for total American
withdrawal. It was negotiated
between the National Student
Association, acting on behalf of
American students, and students
from both North and South
Vietnam. It declares that the
American people have never
supported this war, that we will
do everything we can to disengage
our communities and eventually
our country from it.
The Peace Treaty Collective
has started a People's Peace
Treaty Office whose purpose is to
help other groups organize to
implement the treaty at Stanford

and Palo Alto. This spring must
see even more activity than last
spring's actions following the
Cambodian invasion.
A welcoming committee is being
formed to greet Under Secretary
of Defense (and former Stanford
trustee) David Packard when he
comes here to speak on April 8 at
Richey's Hyatt House. There are
plans to arrest him as a war
criminal when he speaks to local
electronics executives. There are
also plans to expose the role of his
long-time friend and fellow
centi-millionaire, Bill Hewlett
(also a Stanford trustee).
Hewlett is a director of KMC, a
giant conglomerate which
manufactures over $200 million
of defense products per year,
including the Mil 3 armored
personnel carrier, heat-seeking
missiles, gun turrets for ships
patrolling the Mekong Delta, and
the criminal "beehive" bomb,
which is designed only to kill or
maim.

Hewlett knows these facts; in
fact, he deliberately lied about the
nerve gas at a panel discussion at
Stanford two years ago in Mem
Aud. We believe that Hewlett, et
al., must be confronted for what
their corporations produce.
Therefore, this Saturday we are
starting a KNOW YOUR
NEIGHBOR campaign to inform
Hewlett's neighbors just what a
war criminal he is. In a few weeks
we are taking our battle to KMC
in San Jose, where we will picket,
educate, and try to disrupt
"business as usual."
It is time to begin the Spring
Offensive at Stanford now. Sign
the People's Peace Treaty, get
your living groups to endorse it,
and start organizing for
implementation now. Nixon must
be stopped before another deadly
escalation.

amounting to over 50 percent of
the original invasion force. The
war-makers knew that this would
probably happen, all the time
claiming that the invasion was
"proceeding according to
schedule."
The situation for Nixon and his
puppets Thieu and Ky is
becoming more critical all the
time. Opposition to the
Thieu-KyNixon policies is
becoming more vocal in Saigon
itself. Jacques Decornoy,
Southeast Asian editor for Le
Monde, reports that newspapers
are printing articles and editorials
in the Saigon press which would
have been unthinkable even a year
ago. He says that the job of
government censorship is
becoming impossible because of
the volume of opposition.
Thus Nixon is faced with the

same old choice: escalate again or
get out. The problem is even more
critical now for Nixon than it was
for Lyndon Johnson after the Tet
Offensive in 1968. He has very
few possibilities for escalation. He
can mine Haiphong Harbor, and
thus infuriate the Soviets, because
that would destroy their ships in
the harbor. Or he can invade the
North, which would surely bring
the Chinese into the war. Or
finally, he could use tactical
nuclear weapons along the Ho Chi
Minh Trial in Laos and the DMZ
in Vietnam. This could also force
the Chinese into the war.
Therefore, it is crucial for us
here at home to force Nixon to
understand what we have known
for years. That he cannot win this
war, because neither we nor the
Vietnamese people support it. It is
essential that the American people
begin to make their peace with
the Vietnamese people now,
before Nixon escalates again. We
must educate people to
understand that the only

reasonable solution to end the war
is the Provisional Revolutionary
Government's peace proposal
which calls for total American
withdrawal, sets up the
framework for release of
American POWs, the creation of a
coalition government, and for
future free elections.
The People's Peace Treaty is a
good way to force Nixon to set a
final date for total American
withdrawal. It was negotiated
between the National Student
Association, acting on behalf of
American students, and students
from both North and South
Vietnam. It declares that the
American people have never
supported this war, that we will
do everything we can to disengage
our communities and eventually
our country from it.
The Peace Treaty Collective
has started a People's Peace
Treaty Office whose purpose is to
help other groups organize to
implement the treaty at Stanford

and Palo Alto. This spring must
see even more activity than last
spring's actions following the
Cambodian invasion.
A welcoming committee is being
formed to greet Under Secretary
of Defense (and former Stanford
trustee) David Packard when he
comes here to speak on April 8 at
Richey's Hyatt House. There are
plans to arrest him as a war
criminal when he speaks to local
electronics executives. There are
also plans to expose the role of his
long-time friend and fellow
centi-millionaire, Bill Hewlett
(also a Stanford trustee).
Hewlett is a director of KMC, a
giant conglomerate which
manufactures over $200 million
of defense products per year,
including the Mil 3 armored
personnel carrier, heat-seeking
missiles, gun turrets for ships
patrolling the Mekong Delta, and
the criminal "beehive" bomb,
which is designed only to kill or
maim.

Hewlett knows these facts; in
fact, he deliberately lied about the
nerve gas at a panel discussion at
Stanford two years ago in Mem
Aud. We believe that Hewlett, et
al., must be confronted for what
their corporations produce.
Therefore, this Saturday we are
starting a KNOW YOUR
NEIGHBOR campaign to inform
Hewlett's neighbors just what a
war criminal he is. In a few weeks
we are taking our battle to KMC
in San Jose, where we will picket,
educate, and try to disrupt
"business as usual."
It is time to begin the Spring
Offensive at Stanford now. Sign
the People's Peace Treaty, get
your living groups to endorse it,
and start organizing for
implementation now. Nixon must
be stopped before another deadly
escalation.
