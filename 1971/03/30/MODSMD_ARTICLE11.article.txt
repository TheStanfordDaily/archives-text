## Liberals' Radicals Unite! 
### 
Ron and jeff wyden

"Seldom have American
liberals been so feverishly divided,
about anything as they are today
about the Administration's
Vietnam policies. The rough
consensus that liberal'; had arrived
at on both domestic and foreign
policy issues has been rudely
shattered by the reverberations of
this war."
These words were written by
Arnold Kaufman, radical
philosopher and author of The
Radical Liberal, in 1968.
Unfortunately they hold as true
today as they did three years ago.
This spring the possibility of
violence, in the form of guerilla
warfare between angry protesters
and the "authorities" looms large.
Civil disobedience in any of its di
verse manifestations—strikes, sit
ins, demonstrations, is likely to
remain ineffectual, unless the
traditionally hostile radical and
liberal factions unite in an effort
to constructively facilitate change.
Petty Bickering
How absurd it is for a radical
to call a liberal, who has worked
for peace candidates, written his
Congressman long emotional
letters and taken part in an
infinite number of marches, a
"fascist" or "enemy of the
people." These epithets seem to
be aimed at the wrong targets.
Muskie, McCiovern, and Ted
Kennedy cannot be held

responsible for Laos, Cambodia,
Carswell, Haynsworth, AIVTs,
SSTs and the other debacles of
recent policy-making. People tend
to blame any politician,
businessman or other member of
the "Establishment," indeed
anyone who wears a suit and tie,
for everything that goes wrong,
and all are "pigs." The late Robert
Kennedy did not escape angry
rhetoric during his campaign for
President. He responded to
heckling at USF late in the
California primary, when he was
called a "fascist pig," by saying,
"What we need in this country is
to cut down the belligerence. If
we let this hatred and emotion
control our lives we're lost."
The fundamental question
remains, "Can the electoral
process respond to the needs of
the people?" All the time now
you hear students saying they
worked for McCarthy in 1968 and
his defeat proved the electoral
process an ineffectual tool for
producing change. But Gene
McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy
turned the country around
politically. They forced Johnson
out of office and turned Nixon
into a semi-dove. Even the
bastions of Middle American
conservatism such as Lincoln,
Nebraska—not just Madison,
Wisconsin and Berkeley—joined
the movement.
Because McCarthy's campaign

lacked organization and Kennedy
was shot does not prove the
worthlessness of the electoral
process. No one, on the other
hand, can vouch for the
worthiness of the system,
especially considering the
outcome of the Democratic
convention of 1968. But if
radicals and liberals join hands, as
they have now in attempting to
take over the Berkeley City
Council, they can produce a
coalition of immense power, a
coalition that can not only
overcome the conservative
challenge, but sway the apathetic
and cynical members of the silent
majority.
No Discussion of Issues
For the last two springs Mr.
Nixon has been able to
circumvent direct discussion of his
war policies and his floundering
plans to rehabilitate the economy. 112
He makes us—the long-haired
students and campus
protesters—the issue. As Allard
Lowenstein puts it, Nixon and
Agnew are simply asking the
country, "Do you want a bunch
of kids and a bunch of blacks and
a bunch of minority people
bullying the country into their
view?" This is the tactic the
Administration things can lead to
victory, but if radicals and liberals
force the Administration to
concentrate on real issues it
cannot possibly win re-election.
In San Jose last fall Nixon tried
to impress upon thousands of his
wealthy, contented followers the
threat of hippies and drug addicts
making policies in the streets. The
silent majority was impressed to a
lesser degree than Nixon
expected, as the results of the
election show, and the next
election in 1972 will provide a
crucial opportunity for the
anti-Administration people to
follow up their gains. Perhaps by
then Nixon will have toned down
the aggressiveness and will
attempt to rally his supporters
behind the traditional Republican
platforms: "Four more years of
the full dinner pail" and "Four
more years of intensive fighting in
the pursuit of a just and
honorable peace." Or perhaps, in
the face of a radical-liberal
coalition supporting Pete
McCloskey, King Richard will be
forced, as Lyndon Johnson was
forced, to abdicate.

Administration things can lead to
victory, but if radicals and liberals
force the Administration to
concentrate on real issues it
cannot possibly win re-election.
In San Jose last fall Nixon tried
to impress upon thousands of his
wealthy, contented followers the
threat of hippies and drug addicts
making policies in the streets. The
silent majority was impressed to a
lesser degree than Nixon
expected, as the results of the
election show, and the next
election in 1972 will provide a
crucial opportunity for the
anti-Administration people to
follow up their gains. Perhaps by
then Nixon will have toned down
the aggressiveness and will
attempt to rally his supporters
behind the traditional Republican
platforms: "Four more years of
the full dinner pail" and "Four
more years of intensive fighting in
the pursuit of a just and
honorable peace." Or perhaps, in
the face of a radical-liberal
coalition supporting Pete
McCloskey, King Richard will be
forced, as Lyndon Johnson was
forced, to abdicate.

"Seldom have American
liberals been so feverishly divided,
about anything as they are today
about the Administration's
Vietnam policies. The rough
consensus that liberal'; had arrived
at on both domestic and foreign
policy issues has been rudely
shattered by the reverberations of
this war."
These words were written by
Arnold Kaufman, radical
philosopher and author of The
Radical Liberal, in 1968.
Unfortunately they hold as true
today as they did three years ago.
This spring the possibility of
violence, in the form of guerilla
warfare between angry protesters
and the "authorities" looms large.
Civil disobedience in any of its di
verse manifestations—strikes, sit
ins, demonstrations, is likely to
remain ineffectual, unless the
traditionally hostile radical and
liberal factions unite in an effort
to constructively facilitate change.
Petty Bickering
How absurd it is for a radical
to call a liberal, who has worked
for peace candidates, written his
Congressman long emotional
letters and taken part in an
infinite number of marches, a
"fascist" or "enemy of the
people." These epithets seem to
be aimed at the wrong targets.
Muskie, McCiovern, and Ted
Kennedy cannot be held

responsible for Laos, Cambodia,
Carswell, Haynsworth, AIVTs,
SSTs and the other debacles of
recent policy-making. People tend
to blame any politician,
businessman or other member of
the "Establishment," indeed
anyone who wears a suit and tie,
for everything that goes wrong,
and all are "pigs." The late Robert
Kennedy did not escape angry
rhetoric during his campaign for
President. He responded to
heckling at USF late in the
California primary, when he was
called a "fascist pig," by saying,
"What we need in this country is
to cut down the belligerence. If
we let this hatred and emotion
control our lives we're lost."
The fundamental question
remains, "Can the electoral
process respond to the needs of
the people?" All the time now
you hear students saying they
worked for McCarthy in 1968 and
his defeat proved the electoral
process an ineffectual tool for
producing change. But Gene
McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy
turned the country around
politically. They forced Johnson
out of office and turned Nixon
into a semi-dove. Even the
bastions of Middle American
conservatism such as Lincoln,
Nebraska—not just Madison,
Wisconsin and Berkeley—joined
the movement.
Because McCarthy's campaign

lacked organization and Kennedy
was shot does not prove the
worthlessness of the electoral
process. No one, on the other
hand, can vouch for the
worthiness of the system,
especially considering the
outcome of the Democratic
convention of 1968. But if
radicals and liberals join hands, as
they have now in attempting to
take over the Berkeley City
Council, they can produce a
coalition of immense power, a
coalition that can not only
overcome the conservative
challenge, but sway the apathetic
and cynical members of the silent
majority.
No Discussion of Issues
For the last two springs Mr.
Nixon has been able to
circumvent direct discussion of his
war policies and his floundering
plans to rehabilitate the economy. 112
He makes us—the long-haired
students and campus
protesters—the issue. As Allard
Lowenstein puts it, Nixon and
Agnew are simply asking the
country, "Do you want a bunch
of kids and a bunch of blacks and
a bunch of minority people
bullying the country into their
view?" This is the tactic the
Administration things can lead to
victory, but if radicals and liberals
force the Administration to
concentrate on real issues it
cannot possibly win re-election.
