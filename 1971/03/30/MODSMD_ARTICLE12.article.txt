# Ibsen Drama Hits Modern Problems
## ACT Excels In 'Enemy of People' 
### STEVE UNGAR 
Just as the Daily published its
last issue of Winter Quarter, ACT
opened an absolutely splendid
production of "An Enemy of the
People" in San Francisco.
There used to be a joke in the
New York theater that "if you
want to get even with a producer,
talk him into doing Ibsen." The
man who had been called the
"father of modern drama," and
hailed as a genius in countless
English classes, was a disaster at
the box office.
The fiery, outraged, and
defiant retoric that caused
respectable 19th century ladies to
faint in their theater seats seemed
a bit quaint to sophisticated 20th
century theater patrons. And the
issues that had so engaged Ibsen
were no longer of interest; who
worried about pollution or
women's rights?
Things have changed. If you
want to get even with a producer
now, don't even mention Ibsen. In
addition to the San Francisco
production, three of his plays
have opened in New York this
season, and"The Wild Duck" is
being performed at the Berkeley
Repertory.
Touches Modern Problems
It's not surprising that Ibsen
has been "re-discovered."
Although "An Enemy of the
People" ostensibly deals with one

man's fight against official
corruption and public apathy, it
also manages to touch on the
problems of water pollution,
authoritarianism, social
responsibility of the scientist,
women's liberation, political
opportunism, the self-serving
compromise of revolutionary
ideals, the gullibility and
selfishness of the solid (silent)
majority, and (O temporal O
mores!) the trashing of windows
as a form of social protest.
Though set in Norway in 1880,
it is quite obvious that with only
an occasional change of reference,
the play could be set in any small
town in modern America and it
would read like a contemporary
drama.
Which makes one wonder what
we have been doing for ninety
years. Something is wrong when
we worry today about the same
social ills that worried a
Norwegian playwright almost a
century ago. Whatever the reason
for this lack of progress (or is it
perhaps a regression?) it is clear
that Henrik Ibsen's time has
come; once again he is "relevant."
Crusading Doctor
"An Enemy of the People" is
the story of Dr. Tomas
Stockmann, a man who expects to
be hailed as a hero when he
announces that the Public Baths,
which provide the main source of

income for most of his home
town, have been polluted by
industrial wastes and must be
closed. Slowly the naive Dr.
Stockmann discovers that his
fellow townsmen are more
interested in maintaining their
standard of living than they are in
starving to death in the interests
of public health. Instead of being
hailed as a hero, Stockmann is
pilloried as a public enemy.
The current ACT production
of the play is simply brilliant. The
play is a relatively straightforward
entertainment, and Director Allen
Fletcher (who also provided the
precise, modern-American
translation) keeps it moving at a
brisk, almost bouncy, pace.
One real problem that remains
with Ibsen, and which is totally
unrelated to his social relevence, is
his tendency toward the
melodramatic. Characters are
sometimes a bit simplistic, and
transitions are often incredibly
abrupt. With Mr. Fletcher
directing, it doesn't seem to
matter; you become so excited
watching Dr. Stockmann lash out
against the stupidity around him
that you couldn't care less if
Stockmann were a cardboard
cutout suspended by a string.
Superb Acting
The acting is, without
exception, superb. Peter Donat

plays Dr. Stockmann with
irrepressible energy and
enthusiasm, the energy of an
Idealist who has discovered a
Cause. His Dr. Stockmann is
clumsy, good natured, bitingly
sarcastic, maddeningly naive,
stubborn, egotistic, and absolutely
unstoppable once he's convinced
himself that he's right.
Jay Doyle plays Stockmann's
chief adversary, his brother Peter,
the mayor of the town. Peter is an
elitist authoritarian ruler, the kind
that Europe came to know in its
illogical extreme all too well in
the 1930'5. Mr. Doyle's Peter
Stockmann is quiet, infnriatingly
calm and so hateful in his
condescending arrogance that you
want to jump up on the stage and
shake him until his official
mayor's hat falls off.
Josef Sommer is Hovstad, the
"crusading editor" of The
People's Messenger, the

independent liberal paper that
turns out to be not so
independent or liberal when its
circulation is threatened.
Middle Norwegians
William Patterson plays
Aslaksen, a printer, President of
the Property -owners Association;
a Norwegian Middle American, lie
is in favor of reform as long as
there is no danger of change. He is
the silent majority, as alive and
well in the Norway of 1880 as in
the heart of our Vice President
today.
"An Knemy of the People" is
easily the most entertaining play
in ACT's current repertoire, which
is no light compliment. If you see
no other play in San Francisco
this year, see this one. You won't
regret it. Student rush tickets are
available 15 minutes before
curtain, but call to check on
availability before you go.
