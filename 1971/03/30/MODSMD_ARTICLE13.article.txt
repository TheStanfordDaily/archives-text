# Red-hot Ike And Tina Show Turns On R & B Fans
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Her man—lke Turner. An extremely talented
guitarist who plays some of the clearest and finest
guitar solos you'll ever hear and who can join in
with a bass voice which perfectly complements her
husky tones.
His woman—Tina Turner. One of the most
beautiful and hardest-working female performers in
the world. A "female Mick Jagger." She sings blues
that makes every male feel he's her only man. And
she sings everything else in a way that makes you
want to shake and dance and move till you drop.
Each could probably have made it alone and
done alright. But together they work as well as any
husband-wife team I've ever seen. Almost everyone
has heard of them or heard one of their singles or
albums. But as with any group, a live performance
can be the only true test of their talent.
Put to the Test
A couple of thousand people at the University
of San Francisco Gym got to put them to that test
Sunday night. I don't think anyone would say they
didn't pass as one of the great groups in America
today.
Concerts in gymnasiums often lose a little
something. They're usually very crowded and very
hot. The lighting system is usually less than perfect.
The preliminary groups are seldomly not
heavyweights. That was true at USF. But it didn't
matter.
Their show is planned out like a gourmet meal.
First the Kings of Rythm with two saxophones two
guitars, a trumpet, a trombone, an organ and drums
come out. They start with a long funky number
which as they put it, "makes you feel so good
inside."
Then Ike comes on and plugs in his guitar and
starts playing. He plays some of the clearest and
most notes you could ever hear. Then after a
trumpet and saxaphone solo, the lights go out and
only the red lights on the amps let you know where
the stage is.
Hit
Then the Ikettes hit the stage. Three leggy and
lovely ladies come shaking on stage in beautiful
purple satin dresses and silver high heels. They start
off with "Piece of My Heart" and show that each
of them can sing.

But it's when they start dancing that you really
appreciate them. They shake and slide and slither
so well they make you want to try it yourself.
Mashed potato, boogaloo and funky chicken—all in
the same number.
Just when they've got the whole audience
working, they leave. But they're back in a couple
of minutes. And with them comes his woman, Tina
Turner. She comes on wearing an incredibly brief
silver outfit which ends almost before it begins. A
pair of silver high heels and tassels which hang
down from the top of her "dress" complete the
wardrobe.
She Goes to Work
And just as she promises, "she really goes to
work for you." She starts out with "Son of A
Preacher Man" and then goes into her first real hit,
"River Deep, Mountain High." Then she sings what
has to be a perfect autobiographical song for her,"
Honky-Tonk Woman."
She sings beautifully. And two of her numbers
show her at her finest in both rhythm and blues. A
fifteen minute version of "Proud Mary" has her at
her nicest and her roughest.
The song starts slowly with Ike's perfect bass
voice singing an unbelievable onomatopoetic
rendering of "rollin' on the river." Then Tina starts
moving uncontrollably. With the Ikettes close
behind, she shakes up and down and back and
forth across the stage. It almost exhausts you
watching them. I wonder what it must do to them.
Move on Over
But a little later Tina moves over to the blues.
She sings one of her earlier blues hits, "Been
Loving You Too Long," and it is a masterpiece.
With Ike answering her with both voice and guitar,
the song becomes a blues classic.
For their final number they do "I Want to Take
You Higher." It's probably impossible for the
audience to get any higher at this point in the
show. But with Tina singing and dancing, they and
the audience echoing "Higher!," it works.
And then the lights go off except for a low blue
spot and Tina starts moving off stage. The trumpet
player screams Tina Turner!— Tina Turner!— Tina
Turner! and the audience applauds wildly. Fittingly
a smoke machine sends smoke behind Tina as she
leaves. A fitting end to a red-hot show.
