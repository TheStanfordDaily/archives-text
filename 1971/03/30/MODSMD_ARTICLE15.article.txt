# Opera Innovations Succeed
## 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
Perhaps no art-form is more
subject to the whalebone corset of
tradition than is opera, but during
this first season of the Spring
Opera Theater in the more
congenial Curran Theater the
customary approaches to opera
have fallen away with an almost
audible popping of stays and
trusses.
Among the innovations this
year is the placement of the
orchestra out of view behind the
stage (singers' cues available from
variously placed TV sets). This
gave a decided advantage to the
theatrical values of the operas,
creating a sense of intimacy
unusual in an opera-house —
though intimacy with less than
first-rate singing actors has its
drawbacks.
The dangers of this new idea,
lack of unity in the musical
performance, muted orchestral
sound, seemed overcome by what
were clearly carefully and
adequately rehearsed productions
and modest, "porous," and quite
functional set designs.
Relocated 'Don Pasquale'
Donizetti's "Don Pasquale"
represented a rare instance of a
thoroughly workable "relocation"
of an opera, appropriately enough
in San Francisco circa 1909. The
Don became a retired banker and
opera nut, Ernesto a
tennis-playing Yalie (class of '08),
and Norina an oriental domestic.
The overture, in which
Pasquale fantasizes with all his
favorite operatic heroines, was a
positive delight and an apt hint of
the wit and cleverness (albeit now
and then overdone) which was to
follow.
As a whole the cast performed
with more flair than vocal power,
though in the smaller house all

sang comfortably. Shigemi
Matsumoto's well-founded
coloratura as Norina stood out,
wanting only more focus and ease
in the tricky passages. As her lover
John Walker projected an
extremely thin, almost pinched,
tenor voice which was saved by
acute phrasing and suppleness.
Richard Best and William Justus,
as Pasquale a"d Dr. Malatesta,
sang delightfully and managed
their considerable stage business
with aplomb. The chorus and
orchestra, under Everett Lee, were
excellent.
The sets provided by Robert
Darling were ingenious and
Richard Pearl man's direction
provided many memorable stage
pictures; he could be faulted only
perhaps for an over-abundance of
witty minutiae.
Complex Revival of 'Titus'
Mozart's last and criminally
under-performed opera, "Titus"
("La Clemenze di Tito"), which
opened the season on March 18,
received a complex but effective
and musically compelling revival.
A costumed group of young
actors (children in an aristocratic
household of 1791) spoke the
recitative lines, while the music
was sung in the modern-dress
court of a benevolent sovereign.
The conceit of the production
never failed, but as it progressed
the actors (whose delivery was
designedly puerile) became
something of a burden.
This production displayed
considerable forethought and
intelligent direction by William
Francisco. However, the suspicion
was not subjugated that "Titus,"
while dreaded by modern
audiences as an "opera seria,"
could succeed in a good
performance in its original form.
"Titus" u nqestion a b 1 y
contains some of Mozart's most

stunning and beautiful vocal
writing, and it was performed by a
committed and competent cast.
Frederica Von Stade, in the pants
role of Sextus, was the audience's
justified favorite: her agile and
emotive mezzo made the most of
all the vocal obstacles Mozart
placed in her path.
Joan Benner proved equal to
the difficult role of Vitellia,
though some strain was involved
in the higher reaches. As the
clement ruler, William McDonald
presented a bland but ingratiating
tenor voice which held the
Mozartean line firmly except in
the ornate passage of his last aria.
The remainder of the cast was
most effective, as was the singing
of the chorus and Gustav Meier's
leadership in the wings (no "pit"
here!).
A third success was registered
with a modem-but-not-oppressive
ly modish new "Rigoletto."
Again, highly articulate stage
direction combined with effective
set designs to lay a basis for a
vocally competent cast and
spirited conducting (Dennis
Da vies').
Director Gilbert Moses
exercized laudable reserve with his
Black hunchback and the result
was quite moving — due in part to
the gripping portrayal of the title

role by Robert Mosley, whose
voice dominated the evening.
Mosley accomplished the
considerable feat of blending
baritonal lushness and powerful
emotion in a performance marred
only by occasionally odd
gesticulation.
Neither Gilda nor the Duke,
Carol Toscano and Harry Danner,
were fully at ease in their assigned
vocal acrobatics, but still they
sang with vigor and ringing tones.
The supporting cast, Allan Monk
(Monterone), Richard Mundt
(Sp arafu ncile), and Edna
Garabedian-George (Maddalena),
sang excellently and provided a
scintillating Act IV quartet.
Shoestring Designer
Robert Darling, who as
designer in all three productions
has proved beyond cavil his genius
with a shoestring, invented many
marvelous, apt (and a few
superfluous effects. And the
chorus, which has ceased to be a
worn' in San Francisco, sang with
its usual finesse.
A word about the English
translations: they have been on
the whole excellent (one can
always recall excruciating lines).
As well, they have enabled all the
intricate theatricality to achieve
consummation in the minds in the
audience.

here!).
A third success was registered
with a modem-but-not-oppressive
ly modish new "Rigoletto."
Again, highly articulate stage
direction combined with effective
set designs to lay a basis for a
vocally competent cast and
spirited conducting (Dennis
Da vies').
Director Gilbert Moses
exercized laudable reserve with his
Black hunchback and the result
was quite moving — due in part to
the gripping portrayal of the title

role by Robert Mosley, whose
voice dominated the evening.
Mosley accomplished the
considerable feat of blending
baritonal lushness and powerful
emotion in a performance marred
only by occasionally odd
gesticulation.
Neither Gilda nor the Duke,
Carol Toscano and Harry Danner,
were fully at ease in their assigned
vocal acrobatics, but still they
sang with vigor and ringing tones.
The supporting cast, Allan Monk
(Monterone), Richard Mundt
(Sp arafu ncile), and Edna
Garabedian-George (Maddalena),
sang excellently and provided a
scintillating Act IV quartet.
Shoestring Designer
Robert Darling, who as
designer in all three productions
has proved beyond cavil his genius
with a shoestring, invented many
marvelous, apt (and a few
superfluous effects. And the
chorus, which has ceased to be a
worn' in San Francisco, sang with
its usual finesse.
A word about the English
translations: they have been on
the whole excellent (one can
always recall excruciating lines).
As well, they have enabled all the
intricate theatricality to achieve
consummation in the minds in the
audience.
Perhaps no art-form is more
subject to the whalebone corset of
tradition than is opera, but during
this first season of the Spring
Opera Theater in the more
congenial Curran Theater the
customary approaches to opera
have fallen away with an almost
audible popping of stays and
trusses.
Among the innovations this
year is the placement of the
orchestra out of view behind the
stage (singers' cues available from
variously placed TV sets). This
gave a decided advantage to the
theatrical values of the operas,
creating a sense of intimacy
unusual in an opera-house —
though intimacy with less than
first-rate singing actors has its
drawbacks.
The dangers of this new idea,
lack of unity in the musical
performance, muted orchestral
sound, seemed overcome by what
were clearly carefully and
adequately rehearsed productions
and modest, "porous," and quite
functional set designs.
Relocated 'Don Pasquale'
Donizetti's "Don Pasquale"
represented a rare instance of a
thoroughly workable "relocation"
of an opera, appropriately enough
in San Francisco circa 1909. The
Don became a retired banker and
opera nut, Ernesto a
tennis-playing Yalie (class of '08),
and Norina an oriental domestic.
The overture, in which
Pasquale fantasizes with all his
favorite operatic heroines, was a
positive delight and an apt hint of
the wit and cleverness (albeit now
and then overdone) which was to
follow.
As a whole the cast performed
with more flair than vocal power,
though in the smaller house all

sang comfortably. Shigemi
Matsumoto's well-founded
coloratura as Norina stood out,
wanting only more focus and ease
in the tricky passages. As her lover
John Walker projected an
extremely thin, almost pinched,
tenor voice which was saved by
acute phrasing and suppleness.
Richard Best and William Justus,
as Pasquale a"d Dr. Malatesta,
sang delightfully and managed
their considerable stage business
with aplomb. The chorus and
orchestra, under Everett Lee, were
excellent.
The sets provided by Robert
Darling were ingenious and
Richard Pearl man's direction
provided many memorable stage
pictures; he could be faulted only
perhaps for an over-abundance of
witty minutiae.
Complex Revival of 'Titus'
Mozart's last and criminally
under-performed opera, "Titus"
("La Clemenze di Tito"), which
opened the season on March 18,
received a complex but effective
and musically compelling revival.
A costumed group of young
actors (children in an aristocratic
household of 1791) spoke the
recitative lines, while the music
was sung in the modern-dress
court of a benevolent sovereign.
The conceit of the production
never failed, but as it progressed
the actors (whose delivery was
designedly puerile) became
something of a burden.
This production displayed
considerable forethought and
intelligent direction by William
Francisco. However, the suspicion
was not subjugated that "Titus,"
while dreaded by modern
audiences as an "opera seria,"
could succeed in a good
performance in its original form.
"Titus" u nqestion a b 1 y
contains some of Mozart's most

stunning and beautiful vocal
writing, and it was performed by a
committed and competent cast.
Frederica Von Stade, in the pants
role of Sextus, was the audience's
justified favorite: her agile and
emotive mezzo made the most of
all the vocal obstacles Mozart
placed in her path.
Joan Benner proved equal to
the difficult role of Vitellia,
though some strain was involved
in the higher reaches. As the
clement ruler, William McDonald
presented a bland but ingratiating
tenor voice which held the
Mozartean line firmly except in
the ornate passage of his last aria.
The remainder of the cast was
most effective, as was the singing
of the chorus and Gustav Meier's
leadership in the wings (no "pit"
here!).

under-performed opera, "Titus"
("La Clemenze di Tito"), which
opened the season on March 18,
received a complex but effective
and musically compelling revival.
A costumed group of young
actors (children in an aristocratic
household of 1791) spoke the
recitative lines, while the music
was sung in the modern-dress
court of a benevolent sovereign.
The conceit of the production
never failed, but as it progressed
the actors (whose delivery was
designedly puerile) became
something of a burden.
This production displayed
considerable forethought and
intelligent direction by William
Francisco. However, the suspicion
was not subjugated that "Titus,"
while dreaded by modern
audiences as an "opera seria,"
could succeed in a good
performance in its original form.
"Titus" u nqestion a b 1 y
contains some of Mozart's most

stunning and beautiful vocal
writing, and it was performed by a
committed and competent cast.
Frederica Von Stade, in the pants
role of Sextus, was the audience's
justified favorite: her agile and
emotive mezzo made the most of
all the vocal obstacles Mozart
placed in her path.
Joan Benner proved equal to
the difficult role of Vitellia,
though some strain was involved
in the higher reaches. As the
clement ruler, William McDonald
presented a bland but ingratiating
tenor voice which held the
Mozartean line firmly except in
the ornate passage of his last aria.
The remainder of the cast was
most effective, as was the singing
of the chorus and Gustav Meier's
leadership in the wings (no "pit"
here!).
A third success was registered
with a modem-but-not-oppressive
ly modish new "Rigoletto."
Again, highly articulate stage
direction combined with effective
set designs to lay a basis for a
vocally competent cast and
spirited conducting (Dennis
Da vies').
Director Gilbert Moses
exercized laudable reserve with his
Black hunchback and the result
was quite moving — due in part to
the gripping portrayal of the title

role by Robert Mosley, whose
voice dominated the evening.
Mosley accomplished the
considerable feat of blending
baritonal lushness and powerful
emotion in a performance marred
only by occasionally odd
gesticulation.
Neither Gilda nor the Duke,
Carol Toscano and Harry Danner,
were fully at ease in their assigned
vocal acrobatics, but still they
sang with vigor and ringing tones.
The supporting cast, Allan Monk
(Monterone), Richard Mundt
(Sp arafu ncile), and Edna
Garabedian-George (Maddalena),
sang excellently and provided a
scintillating Act IV quartet.
Shoestring Designer
Robert Darling, who as
designer in all three productions
has proved beyond cavil his genius
with a shoestring, invented many
marvelous, apt (and a few
superfluous effects. And the
chorus, which has ceased to be a
worn' in San Francisco, sang with
its usual finesse.
A word about the English
translations: they have been on
the whole excellent (one can
always recall excruciating lines).
As well, they have enabled all the
intricate theatricality to achieve
consummation in the minds in the
audience.
Perhaps no art-form is more
subject to the whalebone corset of
tradition than is opera, but during
this first season of the Spring
Opera Theater in the more
congenial Curran Theater the
customary approaches to opera
have fallen away with an almost
audible popping of stays and
trusses.
Among the innovations this
year is the placement of the
orchestra out of view behind the
stage (singers' cues available from
variously placed TV sets). This
gave a decided advantage to the
theatrical values of the operas,
creating a sense of intimacy
unusual in an opera-house —
though intimacy with less than
first-rate singing actors has its
drawbacks.
The dangers of this new idea,
lack of unity in the musical
performance, muted orchestral
sound, seemed overcome by what
were clearly carefully and
adequately rehearsed productions
and modest, "porous," and quite
functional set designs.
Relocated 'Don Pasquale'
Donizetti's "Don Pasquale"
represented a rare instance of a
thoroughly workable "relocation"
of an opera, appropriately enough
in San Francisco circa 1909. The
Don became a retired banker and
opera nut, Ernesto a
tennis-playing Yalie (class of '08),
and Norina an oriental domestic.
The overture, in which
Pasquale fantasizes with all his
favorite operatic heroines, was a
positive delight and an apt hint of
the wit and cleverness (albeit now
and then overdone) which was to
follow.
As a whole the cast performed
with more flair than vocal power,
though in the smaller house all

sang comfortably. Shigemi
Matsumoto's well-founded
coloratura as Norina stood out,
wanting only more focus and ease
in the tricky passages. As her lover
John Walker projected an
extremely thin, almost pinched,
tenor voice which was saved by
acute phrasing and suppleness.
Richard Best and William Justus,
as Pasquale a"d Dr. Malatesta,
sang delightfully and managed
their considerable stage business
with aplomb. The chorus and
orchestra, under Everett Lee, were
excellent.
The sets provided by Robert
Darling were ingenious and
Richard Pearl man's direction
provided many memorable stage
pictures; he could be faulted only
perhaps for an over-abundance of
witty minutiae.
