# Industrial Accidents Increasing
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
In 1971 more men will die on their
jobs as the result of an industrial
accident than will be killed in combat
in Vietnam. The hazardous working
conditions and toxic environments of
America's factories, foundries and
mines now result in 15,000 deaths and
more than 2 million disabling accidents
each year according to the Assistant
Secretary of Labor, Jerome M. Roscow.
"The number of deaths on the job
has increased more than 20% since
1958" Roscow said in a recent New
York Times article, which prompted
the leader of a major industrial union
to say, "all things considered, working
conditions are far worse in American
industry today than the_'ve ever been."
What makes today's industrial
working conditions worse than ever
before, according to Toni Mazzochi of
the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers
union, is "because modern technology
is taking us rapidly along new paths
without anyone having checked in
advance to see what the consequences
of these new activities would be on the
worker."
Mazzochi and others make these
somber evaluations about America's
industrial working conditions in light of
reports such as a Rockefeller University

study released early this year which
showed that blue collar packagers of
newly developed enzyme detergents are
now contracting respiratory diseases at
a rate three times the national average.
Poisonous Gas
In that same report, a New York
team of scientists headed by Glenn
Paulson of Rockefeller University
discovered that workers in some lead
smelting plants are exposed to eight
times the prescribed maximum of
carbon monoxide fumes recommended
by the U.S. Public Health Department
and concluded that at least one death
and two cases of severe brain damage
are the result of the over-exposure to
the gas.
Another report released last
November by Dr. William J. Nicholson
of the Mount Sinai Medical Clinic in
New York City linked 400 deaths in
two Industrial Unions in New York and
New Jersey to the work the men did in
textile plants in New York.
"Asbestos workers in those plants
are dying of cancer at a rate much
higher than the general population,"
Dr. Nicholson said in a New York
Times interview, "and in the future,
many hundreds will die from asbestosis,
from inhalation of asbestos dust, a

disease that is completely preventable
with proper safety controls."
Mines That Kill
The biggest killer in blue collar
industry is still coal mining operations,
an occupation that the Public Safety
Council has awarded the dubious
distinction of having the worst safety
record of any American industry.
While more than half of the nation's
coal mines have been shut down in the
last 12 months because of the
imminent danger to the safety of
workers, not one mine has been fined
or permanently closed for hazardous
mining operations.
The January 9th issue of Business
Week reported that "Collectively the
coal mining industry has been charged
with 33,000 violations since last April."
Most of these violations are the result
of mine operators allowing work to
continue in their mines when the coal
dust levels in the mine are higher than
the safe level.
A study completed by the Kentucky
Department of Health in December
showed that in the 860 underground
mines examined, the coal dust levels
averaged 14 times the prescribed
maximum and in some mines the levels
were 60 times the maximum.
The exposure to coal dust causes
Black Lung disease among miners and
there are now more than 230.000

miners who art* on record in the Social
Security files as having contracted the
incurable disease.
New Safety Bill
Some steps have been taken to
protect industrial workers from
hazardous working conditions, the
most notable being the passage of the
comprehensive Occupational Safety
and Health Act of 1970. Labor
Secretary James I). Hodgson lauded the
legislation as "the most significant
achievement of the decade for the
American worker."
Others see the bill as something less
than a victory for the worker. Anthony
Obadal, Labor Relations Director for
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce which
bitterly opposed the original safety bill,
characterized the bill as a victory for
business, not labor. "It is not
completely what industry desired,"
Obadal said in a letter to local Chamber
offices, "but it is far removed from
what organized labor originally
sought."
While the Health and Safety Bill was
a promising first step towards making
the working environment a safe one for
the nation's blue collar workers, even
Labor Department officials admit that
it is only a first step.
"We've got less than 200 inspectors
for the coal mines," Bureau of Mines
Director Klburt Osborn conceded in a
congressional hearing recently, "and we
need 750."
The real solution to the problems of
industrial hazards most labor leaders
feel, is by making fundamental changes
in the attitudes of corporate
management. "The only way out is for
industry to redesign its factories and
other facilities from the ground up,"
United Auto Workers legislative
representative, Frank Wallick said in a
recent College Press Service interview.
"But companies won't do this on
their own," Wallick said, "They need to
be prodded. And for that, the unions
need allies. We need the
environmentalist, the scientist and the
student."
