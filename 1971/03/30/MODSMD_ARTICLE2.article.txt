# Capacity Crowd Hears Speech
## Fonda Favors People's Treaty 
### DON LINDEMANN 
Actress Jane Fonda spoke in favor
of the "People's Peace Treaty" last
nigh before an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel auditorium, saying that "we
must be prepared to lay our bodies on
the line" to implement the treaty.
Miss Fonda speaking after an
opening presentation by the San
FVancisco Mime Troupe, said that the
8-point treaty is being circulated in
campuses and other communities across
the country.
She stressed two of the points as
most important: 1) that Americans

agree to immediate and total
withdrawal and 2) that Americans
pledge to end the imposition of the
Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime on the people
of South Vietnam
Political Issue
The 34-year-old star of Barbarella
and They Shoot Horses Don't They?
described the alleged atrocities by U.S.
soldiers which were revealed during the
Winter Soldier Investigation, held in
Detroit two months ago. Miss Fonda
said the investigation showed that the
"Mai Lai massacre was not an isolated
incident."

President Nixon is "using the POW
issue to make the American people hate
the North Vietnamese," she said. But,
she continued, "the inhumanity is ours,
not the North Vietnamese. We drop the
equivalent of two and a half Hiroshimas
a week on Vietnam."
The actress condoned violence as a
response to American war crimes. "A
fight against repression," she said, "is a
righteous violence."
American soldiers are beginning to
realize that they've been lied to, said
Miss Fonda citing the increase of
fragging (grenade attacks on officers) as
evidence. Life magazine stressed the
fragging incidents in a recent article,
she said.
"If Life magazine is talking about
fragging, you can imagine what's going
on over there," she continued.
Miss Fonda drew applause from the
attentive audience when she satirized
Nixon's apparent reluctance to be the
first U.S. President to lose a war.
Losing An Army
"Given the growing anti-war
sentiment among Gl's, he may be the
first American President to lose an
army," she said. She said the U.S.
desertion rate has tripled in the last
three years, approaching the level of
the South Vietnamese force. She called
this "the Vietnamization of the U.S.
army."
Speaking of the People's Peace
Treaty, she said," This is not a petition
to end the war. This is a declaration of
peace. If the war is to end, it is to these
eight points that our negotiators must
address themselves."
There is a "burgeoning political
awareness" among the American
people, according to Miss Fonda. To
implement the treaty, "We must be
prepared to lay our bodies on the line,
we must be prepared for civil
disobedience ... we must be prepared
for repression."
According to Miss Fonda, the NLF
is a broad popular front forming one

part of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government in South Vietnam. She
said "the PRG's only purpose is to
insure free democratic elections in
Vietnam." She accused Nixon of
distorting the PRG's objectives as total
dominance in a Vietnamese coalition
government.

a week on Vietnam."
The actress condoned violence as a
response to American war crimes. "A
fight against repression," she said, "is a
righteous violence."
American soldiers are beginning to
realize that they've been lied to, said
Miss Fonda citing the increase of
fragging (grenade attacks on officers) as
evidence. Life magazine stressed the
fragging incidents in a recent article,
she said.
"If Life magazine is talking about
fragging, you can imagine what's going
on over there," she continued.
Miss Fonda drew applause from the
attentive audience when she satirized
Nixon's apparent reluctance to be the
first U.S. President to lose a war.
Losing An Army
"Given the growing anti-war
sentiment among Gl's, he may be the
first American President to lose an
army," she said. She said the U.S.
desertion rate has tripled in the last
three years, approaching the level of
the South Vietnamese force. She called
this "the Vietnamization of the U.S.
army."
Speaking of the People's Peace
Treaty, she said," This is not a petition
to end the war. This is a declaration of
peace. If the war is to end, it is to these
eight points that our negotiators must
address themselves."
There is a "burgeoning political
awareness" among the American
people, according to Miss Fonda. To
implement the treaty, "We must be
prepared to lay our bodies on the line,
we must be prepared for civil
disobedience ... we must be prepared
for repression."
According to Miss Fonda, the NLF
is a broad popular front forming one

part of the Provisional Revolutionary
Government in South Vietnam. She
said "the PRG's only purpose is to
insure free democratic elections in
Vietnam." She accused Nixon of
distorting the PRG's objectives as total
dominance in a Vietnamese coalition
government.


BARBARELLA SPEAKS—Actress Jane Fonda, who has interrupted her
cinematic career to work for radical causes, spoke at Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
night. Miss Fonda, whose early career includeda nude spread in Playboy, spoke in
favor of womens' liberation and against the war in Indochina.
Actress Jane Fonda spoke in favor
of the "People's Peace Treaty" last
nigh before an overflow crowd in
Dinkelspiel auditorium, saying that "we
must be prepared to lay our bodies on
the line" to implement the treaty.
Miss Fonda speaking after an
opening presentation by the San
FVancisco Mime Troupe, said that the
8-point treaty is being circulated in
campuses and other communities across
the country.
She stressed two of the points as
most important: 1) that Americans

agree to immediate and total
withdrawal and 2) that Americans
pledge to end the imposition of the
Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime on the people
of South Vietnam
Political Issue
The 34-year-old star of Barbarella
and They Shoot Horses Don't They?
described the alleged atrocities by U.S.
soldiers which were revealed during the
Winter Soldier Investigation, held in
Detroit two months ago. Miss Fonda
said the investigation showed that the
"Mai Lai massacre was not an isolated
incident."

President Nixon is "using the POW
issue to make the American people hate
the North Vietnamese," she said. But,
she continued, "the inhumanity is ours,
not the North Vietnamese. We drop the
equivalent of two and a half Hiroshimas
a week on Vietnam."
