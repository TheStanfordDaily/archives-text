The Daily apologizes for the misleading statement under the front page
picture of .Jane Franklin in the last issue of last quarter (March 5, 1971). The
statement called the incident pictured (.lane Franklin talking to a Santa Clara
County Sheriff at the courthouse) a "courtroom clash." There was no clash
and, as the statement hints, Mrs. Franklin was explaining that she was a
defendant before she was allowed in the overcrowded courtroom.
Also, the Daily incorrectly stated that Associate English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin faces misdemeanor charges of assault and battery on a
policeman stemming from a Jan. 25 demonstration in Redwood City. This is
not one of the charges against Franklin.
The Daily regrets these errors and apologizes to those involved as well as to
its readers.
