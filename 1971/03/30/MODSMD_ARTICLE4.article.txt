# Tate Jury Gives Death Penalty
## 
### 
From Wire Services
LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles jury yesterday
afternoon sentenced Charles Manson and three
female members of his "clan" to die in the San
Quentin gas chamber for murdering actress Sharon
Tate and six others.
All four defendants were ejected from the
packed courtroom for outbursts against the judge
and jury before the judge could complete the
reading of the sentences.
When the jury returned to the courtroom after
less than two full days of deliberation, Manson, 36,
shouted before any of the sentences could be
pronounced:
"I don't see how you can get by with this. You
don't have no authority over me. You're not nearly
as good as me. This is not the people's courtroom."
After Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older
ordered Manson out, the three female codefendants,
their long hair cropped to their skulls for the
occasion, spoke out.
Self-Judgement
"You've all judged yourselves," said Patricia
Krenwinkel, 23. "It's gonna come down hard. Lock
your doors. Protect your kids," cried Susan Atkins,
22. After she was ordered out of the room, she
shouted: "Remove yourself from the face of the
earth. You're all fools."
The fourth codefendant, Leslie Van Houten, 21,
was ordered out after she muttered, "You've all just
judged yourselves."
The defense attorneys appeared shaken by the 27
death sentences brought in by the jury, which was
sitting in the penalty phase of the nine-month trial.
The attorney had asked the jury for "the gift of
life" for the defendants.
Female members of the jury had tears in their
eyes and the foreman wiped his eyes after the

verdicts. Judge Older has the power to reduce the
sentences to life imprisonment, which means the
four could be released on parole in as few as seven
years. The state had demanded the death penalty,
terming the defendants "human monsters."
The trial was the longest such criminal
proceeding in California and possibly the longest in
the nation.
Protecting Society
One juror, Marie Mesmer, later told reporters:
"I think we gave the prosecution and defense a
fair trial. . . everyone tried. She called Manson "the
leader, the worst... a dangerous influence on
society... in my verdict I wanted to protect
society."
The judge thanked the jurors profusely and said
that if it were possible, he would award a medal of
honor to each for what he called "a trying ordeal."
He said he knew of no jury that had been
sequestered for so long.
The jury's decision followed 10 hours of
deliberations over two days, after an eight week
penalty trial. The original deliberations, following
the seven-month trial, took nearly 43 hours over 11
days.
A California trial judge has the power to reduce a
dealth penalty to life imprisonment, but cannot do
the reverse. Judge Older recently changed a death
sentence to one of life imprisonment in the case of
an ex-convict accused of setting fire to a bed where
two persons were sleeping. One of them, a
16-year-old girl, later died of burns.
Under California law the jury that returns
convictions of first degree murder or conspiracy
must sit at the penalty phase, hearing testimony and
arguments to help it decide between death and life
imprisonment. Thr law provides no standards for
aaessing the penalties.

He said he knew of no jury that had been
sequestered for so long.
The jury's decision followed 10 hours of
deliberations over two days, after an eight week
penalty trial. The original deliberations, following
the seven-month trial, took nearly 43 hours over 11
days.
A California trial judge has the power to reduce a
dealth penalty to life imprisonment, but cannot do
the reverse. Judge Older recently changed a death
sentence to one of life imprisonment in the case of
an ex-convict accused of setting fire to a bed where
two persons were sleeping. One of them, a
16-year-old girl, later died of burns.
Under California law the jury that returns
convictions of first degree murder or conspiracy
must sit at the penalty phase, hearing testimony and
arguments to help it decide between death and life
imprisonment. Thr law provides no standards for
aaessing the penalties.

LOS ANGELES — A Los Angeles jury yesterday
afternoon sentenced Charles Manson and three
female members of his "clan" to die in the San
Quentin gas chamber for murdering actress Sharon
Tate and six others.
All four defendants were ejected from the
packed courtroom for outbursts against the judge
and jury before the judge could complete the
reading of the sentences.
When the jury returned to the courtroom after
less than two full days of deliberation, Manson, 36,
shouted before any of the sentences could be
pronounced:
"I don't see how you can get by with this. You
don't have no authority over me. You're not nearly
as good as me. This is not the people's courtroom."
After Superior Court Judge Charles H. Older
ordered Manson out, the three female codefendants,
their long hair cropped to their skulls for the
occasion, spoke out.
Self-Judgement
"You've all judged yourselves," said Patricia
Krenwinkel, 23. "It's gonna come down hard. Lock
your doors. Protect your kids," cried Susan Atkins,
22. After she was ordered out of the room, she
shouted: "Remove yourself from the face of the
earth. You're all fools."
The fourth codefendant, Leslie Van Houten, 21,
was ordered out after she muttered, "You've all just
judged yourselves."
The defense attorneys appeared shaken by the 27
death sentences brought in by the jury, which was
sitting in the penalty phase of the nine-month trial.
The attorney had asked the jury for "the gift of
life" for the defendants.
Female members of the jury had tears in their
eyes and the foreman wiped his eyes after the

verdicts. Judge Older has the power to reduce the
sentences to life imprisonment, which means the
four could be released on parole in as few as seven
years. The state had demanded the death penalty,
terming the defendants "human monsters."
The trial was the longest such criminal
proceeding in California and possibly the longest in
the nation.
Protecting Society
One juror, Marie Mesmer, later told reporters:
"I think we gave the prosecution and defense a
fair trial. . . everyone tried. She called Manson "the
leader, the worst... a dangerous influence on
society... in my verdict I wanted to protect
society."
The judge thanked the jurors profusely and said
that if it were possible, he would award a medal of
honor to each for what he called "a trying ordeal."
He said he knew of no jury that had been
sequestered for so long.
