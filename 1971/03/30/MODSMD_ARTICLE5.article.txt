premeditated murder of 22 Vietnamese
civilians at the 1968 My Lai massacre.
He is the first American to be held
responsible for the My Lai incident.
The same jury that convicted Calley
is scheduled to begin the penalty phase
of his trial this morning. The six-man
military jury will have two options: life
imprisonment at hard labor or death by
hanging. A unanimous vote is necessary
for the death sentence, while five out
of the six is sufficient to remand Calley
to life imprisonment. In the event of a
hung jury, a new jury will be'
empaneled.
An appeal through the military
court system is mandatory. Appeals can
go as high as President Nixon and the
U.S. Supreme Court.

The verdict of premediated murder
came during the 13th day of jury
deliberations which followed a record
four-month trial.
Two enlisted men have been
acquitted on charges arising out of My
Calley is the first officer to be
found guilty in connection with the
March IH. 19H»S, search and destroy
mission near the little village.
The infantry assault against My Lai
was spearheaded by Galley's platoon, a
unit within the American division. The
opera! ion failed to flush out any Viet
Cong and the operation disintegrated

into an execution of civilian villagers.
No Big Deal
"It was no big deal," Calley testified
during the trial. "I felt then and 1 still
do that 1 acted as 1 was directed and I
carried out the order that I was given
and I do not feel wrong in doing so."
However, the government
prosecutor told the jury in summation:
"He was running the show, gentlemen,
on his own direction.
Lt. William Calley, 27, was
convicted yesterday of the
premeditated murder of 22 Vietnamese
civilians at the 1968 My Lai massacre.
He is the first American to be held
responsible for the My Lai incident.
The same jury that convicted Calley
is scheduled to begin the penalty phase
of his trial this morning. The six-man
military jury will have two options: life
imprisonment at hard labor or death by
hanging. A unanimous vote is necessary
for the death sentence, while five out
of the six is sufficient to remand Calley
to life imprisonment. In the event of a
hung jury, a new jury will be'
empaneled.
An appeal through the military
court system is mandatory. Appeals can
go as high as President Nixon and the
U.S. Supreme Court.
