# gays' gift to straights
## Breakdown Of Roles 
### 
maiid haimson

I've been speaking at schools
and other institutions about gay
people and particularly about gay
women. I'm learning what
questions and opinions other
people usually have and where my
interests lie. In people's heads
there is a continual stress on
difference, between women and
men and gay and straight people.
We are always asked why people
are gay— a reason implies a
sickness, but it also implies a
prevention and it categorizes.
Ultimately if you take all the
basic reasons I have heard for
homosexual behavior, men are
gay (they don't worry too much
about women) because they have
a dominant moth r, a passive
mother, a castration complex, or
they come from broken homes or
a stable home where they don't
think they can live up to their
parents, etc. etc. So if everyone
who should be gay were, everyone
in this room or reading this should
be gay. People seldom ask straight
people why they are straight.
Home Roles
Another question we almost
always get is, who does what?
Doesn't one woman come home,
put her feet up while the other
woman cooks and cleans. Don't

we play men and women. Though
it's an important question I often
have a longing to laugh. Some
homosexual relations, men and
women, are hung up on the role
playing, but fewer than straight
couples. For gay people have to
start from scratch, build their own
relations. There's a freedom and
equality and a friendship I have
seldom seen in straight
relationships.
It is this breakdown of roles
that 1 consider important for
everyone, and it is one of the
realms where the gay world has
much to offer the straight world,
a distinction which should not
exist. Relationships in the straight
world seem so often based on
power— one person is on top, the
other on the bottom. The sex of
the country seems to resemble the
politics. The roles depend on a
lack of communication. Men can't
admit weakness and gentleness,
women can't admit drive and
inititive ha*' do learn to express
affectio" ior other, of opposite
and efferent sexes whether they
are gay or straight.
Social System Imbalance
Perhaps that's why
homosexuality threatens so many
people— it questions the carefully
balanced imbalance of the social

system. (Jay people often refuse
to accept relations where one
person oppresses and the other
accepts the oppression. In that
kind of situation both people lose
out. The one on top has to lose
sensitivity and the one on the
bottom, self.
It's not that people usually
have such difficulty dealing with
gay people, but they have great
trouble loosening their mental
distinctions between men and
women that gay people enact.
People can understand my being a
gay woman if they think I want to
be a man, but the idea that I love
a women and do not want to be
either the active or the passive
member of the relationship,
surprises them

Home Roles
Another question we almost
always get is, who does what?
Doesn't one woman come home,
put her feet up while the other
woman cooks and cleans. Don't

we play men and women. Though
it's an important question I often
have a longing to laugh. Some
homosexual relations, men and
women, are hung up on the role
playing, but fewer than straight
couples. For gay people have to
start from scratch, build their own
relations. There's a freedom and
equality and a friendship I have
seldom seen in straight
relationships.
It is this breakdown of roles
that 1 consider important for
everyone, and it is one of the
realms where the gay world has
much to offer the straight world,
a distinction which should not
exist. Relationships in the straight
world seem so often based on
power— one person is on top, the
other on the bottom. The sex of
the country seems to resemble the
politics. The roles depend on a
lack of communication. Men can't
admit weakness and gentleness,
women can't admit drive and
inititive ha*' do learn to express
affectio" ior other, of opposite
and efferent sexes whether they
are gay or straight.
Social System Imbalance
Perhaps that's why
homosexuality threatens so many
people— it questions the carefully
balanced imbalance of the social

system. (Jay people often refuse
to accept relations where one
person oppresses and the other
accepts the oppression. In that
kind of situation both people lose
out. The one on top has to lose
sensitivity and the one on the
bottom, self.
It's not that people usually
have such difficulty dealing with
gay people, but they have great
trouble loosening their mental
distinctions between men and
women that gay people enact.
People can understand my being a
gay woman if they think I want to
be a man, but the idea that I love
a women and do not want to be
either the active or the passive
member of the relationship,
surprises them

I've been speaking at schools
and other institutions about gay
people and particularly about gay
women. I'm learning what
questions and opinions other
people usually have and where my
interests lie. In people's heads
there is a continual stress on
difference, between women and
men and gay and straight people.
We are always asked why people
are gay— a reason implies a
sickness, but it also implies a
prevention and it categorizes.
Ultimately if you take all the
basic reasons I have heard for
homosexual behavior, men are
gay (they don't worry too much
about women) because they have
a dominant moth r, a passive
mother, a castration complex, or
they come from broken homes or
a stable home where they don't
think they can live up to their
parents, etc. etc. So if everyone
who should be gay were, everyone
in this room or reading this should
be gay. People seldom ask straight
people why they are straight.
