j Today In The 4 Daily' j
Imagine today was March 31, 1968 instead of 1971. You I
\ could amaze your friends by predicting Lyndon Johnson wasn't i.
\ going to run for President. Perhaps he was tired of fighting for *
j peace. Or maybe he decided to follow yesterday's horoscope, j
j "Admire an influential friend and plan a less confusing future." *
J After all Harry Truman announced he was passing the buck j
j likewise 19 years ago. *
If you want to pass the buck tell the news office at x 4632. If \
i you have more than one to pass, the business office needs them \
J badly at 327-4150. j
