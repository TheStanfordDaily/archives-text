# Holman Works For Healthy Society
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Not every member of the Hoiman
family is a member of Venceremos.
Unlike his children, Andrea and
Michael, Dr. Hal Hoiman, head of the
department of medicine at the medical
school, wears no red button and is
named in no injunctions. Nonetheless,
he is an activist in his own right -
working on political questions as a
faculty member, an administrator, and
as a private citizen.
He examines the world about him
much as any doctor would treat a
disease - seeking the causes rather than
the symptoms of societal ills. His focus
is far beyond the field of health care,
reasoning that, "Medical politics or
university politics are both very, very
deeply influenced by the political
health of the nation, so you have to go
beyond that."
Political History
His earliest political efforts wer<»
more limited. While a medical student,
he helped form a medical student
organization, concerned with questions
of curricula and the delivery of health
care. "We had an affiliation with the
International Union of Students, and I
had a chance to travel in Eastern and
Western Europe," he recalls. "I learned

a lot then, and from that point onward,
it was a question of developing my own
opinions."
Those opinions are now
well-formed. Speaking of society at
large, Hoiman feels, that; "the
economy of the country must be
developed so that the country is
self-sufficient and not dependent upon
exploiting other peoples outside of this
country. 1 can't visualize that
happening in any satisfactory way until
that economy is also established in a
way that does not exploit people who
live here."
These changes, he feels, will not
come without further changes in the
decision-making structure of America,
allowing further participation to those
people involved in the process of
change.
His analysis of the current situation
goes beyond economics. "Another area
that clearly has to be dealt with is the
area of rascism," Hoiman notes. "This
requires a really extraordinary kind of
national leadership which is willing to
address these problems, and we haven't
any, as far as I can see."
A Question of Leaders
The question of leadership is one
that figures prominently in his

conversation and thought. "Another
real issue is the question of political
democracy, the ways in which you
facilitate the participation of the
governed in the process of
government," Hoiman says. This, a
question of the role of administration
in modern society, is a key to his
conception of the doctor's role.
"The role of the doctor is essentially
the role of the person who translates
general knowledge into specific action
in particular cases," he holds. "The
system we set up doesn't function that
way; rather, we tend to function as
though the doctor owns the knowledge
and sells it to the people who need it.
Therefore, their position is that of
being passive receptacles for his
activities - they do what he says or
nothing happens."
Participatory Patients
Just as he would involve people in
the process of governmental
decision-making, he hopes to involve
patients in their own health care. He
argues from experience that "The
practice of medicine is far better for
the patient and far more rewarding for
the doctor when one involves the patient
deeply in an understanding of the

disease or medical problem and in the
decision making that is involved. The
doctor becomes in a sense an advisor, a
person to be sure who has certain skills
and understandings that the patient
doesn't have, who sketches out for the
patient a series of alternatives and their
consequences."
This critique of the present
physician's role extends into the field
of health insurance. Holman claims that
the greatest criticism of the health
insurance programs is their take it or
leave it nature. A subscriber has no way
to alter a plan of services other than
leaving it for another. "The subscribers,
patients, customers, call them what you
will, are passive recipients of someone
else's system," he says.
The same model applies to teaching,
he says."The relationship is always
that of the dominant individual
providing information and patterns of
behavior for the subordinate individual.
Good learning is the exact opposite of
that - it's the challenge to the existing
and the re-evaluation of existing
thought that results in new
knowledge."
New knowledge is essential to his

definition of education. He argues that,
"You've got to have research in order
to have viable education," but is critical
of current university research policies,
feeling that research has been
segregated from general education, and
that the scope of research here has been
very narrow.
Opposes Injunction
At present, much of Dr. Holman's
energies are devoted to the faculty
Political Action Group (FPAG), a
group of activist faculty members
opposed to a number of administration
policies. He is vigorously opposed to
the recent injunction issued at the
request of the administration. He says
that "the injunction represents a gross
overreaction on the part of the
administration to a problem in which it
cannot satisfactorily answer its
constituents who raise legitimate
questions about the behavior of the
administration."
Aligning himself with some of the
people named in the injunction,
Holman argues that, "When one talks
to people who are very much in favor
of the injunction, they answer that
these people want to destroy the
university. I haven't met a single soul
here myself who wants to destroy the
university. They want to change, and I
want to change it, too."
Has his committment to change
posed any difficulties to Hal Holman's
professional life? He thinks not, "I
would defend the fact that my
concepts of my responsibilities as a
member of the faculty are changed and
improved by participation in efforts as
a citizen in general and efforts
specifically to change the university."
He appears more than content to
continue treating both people and their
institutions for their ills.
