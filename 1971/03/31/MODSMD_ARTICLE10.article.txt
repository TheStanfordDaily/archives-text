Soviets Agree To BW Ban
GENEVA—The Soviet Union in a surprise move, broke
nearly two years of deadlock in the Geneva disarmament
talks yesterday by agreeing to a Western idea of a separate
ban on biological weapons of war.
Abandoning previous opposition, Soviet delegate Alexei
A. Roschin presented a draft convention prohibiting
development, production and stockpiling of biological
weapons and toxins.
The draft provides for destruction of all these arms
within three months after the treaty enters into force.
The Soviet policy shift coincided with Soviet party chief
Leonid I. Brezhnev's call for a five-power conference on
nuclear disarmament, made at the opening of the Soviet
Communist party congress in Moscow.
Plane Hijacked To China
HONG KONG — Communist China remained silent early
today on the fate of a Philippine airliner, hijacked with 25

passengers and five crew members on board and flown to
Canton, on the mainland.
The passengers, including four Americans, and the crew
landed in the southern Chinese city shortly after midday
Tuesday. Thirteen hours later there was still no word of
what action the Peking government would take.
S.F. Teachers Vole To Strike
SAN FRANCISCO — The Classroom Teachers Association
voted 779-4 79 last night to join the week-old strike by the
San Francisco Federation of Teachers at one minute after
midnight.
With the CTA's 2,700 teachers added to the 1,500
members of the SFFT, an AFL-CIO affiliate, all but about
45 0 of the city's 4,655 teachers appeared sure to be off the
job Wednesday.
Mayor Joseph Alioto said he will intervene Wednesday
to force a settlement. He did not say what powers would be
invoked, but three years ago he kept teachers in continuous
negotiations until a settlement was reached.
