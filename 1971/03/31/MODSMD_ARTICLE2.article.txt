# Indonesia Workshop Stresses U.S. Role

The United States played an integral
part in the 1965 army coup which
resulted in the slaughter of up to a
million Indonesian Communists,
according to two local Asian scholars.
David Ransom of the Pacific Studies
Center and Dr. John Gurley, Professor
of Economics expressed this view at a
Concerned Asian Scholars Indonesia
Workshop last night. Some 80 people,
including students who served with
Volunteers In Asia in Indonesia, came
to Jordan Hall for the session.
Professor Gurley held that the
purpose of American policy in
Southeast Asia has been to "keep the
area open to trade and foreign
investment by our large multi-national
corporations." This end is promoted by
supporting friendly governments with
military and economic aid, CIA
counter-insurgency work and, if
necessary, through direct military
intervention.
Gurley and Ransom outlined the use

of military and economic aid in the
case of Indonesia. A nation of over 100
million people, Indonesia is
extraordinarily rich in natural
resources. Richard Nixon termed it in
1967 "the greatest prize in the
Southeast Asia Area.
Since Suharto came to power, the
United States has acted through the
World Bank and the International
Monetary Fund to create a favorable
investment climate in Indonesia,
according to Gurley. The "go-slow"
economic policy favored by the U.S.
prevents heavy industrialization of
Indonesia and does not benefit the
people of that country, he believes.
Ransom chronicled the 20 year
ascent to power of the Indonesian
army. He noted that military was
nurtured by the United States. Almost
its entire officers corps were trained in
America. After the 1965 coup, the
army moved against the unarmed PKI,
the Indonesian communist party. The
result, Ransom stated, was the massacre
of perhaps a million people.
