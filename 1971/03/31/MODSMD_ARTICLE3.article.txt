# Ecologists Triumph, Boeing Suffers
## Congress Shoots Down SST: Why? 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
The Senate's 5 2 to 4 6 defeat of
funds for the American supersonic
transport last week, after a similar (and
equally surprising) House vote of 215
to 204, has effectively shot down the
last hopes for Boeing's big plane.
But just why the $134 million
appropriation, to have been used to
complete two SST prototypes, was
denied is unclear. While ecology
enthusiasts claim the vote as a major
victory, many congressmen do not
seem to have been motivated by
ecological principles at all. Even less
clear are the implications for the future
of the American aerospace industry;
and the most puzzling, and in many
eyes the most important question, is
the effect of the death of the SST
project on the nation's soaring
unemployment— particularly in the
aerospace and electronics industries,
and particularly in the already hard-hit
Seattle area.
Despite recent rumor of a Japanese
interest in buying the SST "scrap pile"
— blueprints, mockups, research, and
tools— at ten cents on the dollar, and
some faint speculation that a group of
private business concerns would

miraculously appear, $300 million (the
plane's eventual cost) in hand, to
underwrite the project, it appears that
the only thing that could have saved
the 1800 mph jet was a federal subsidy.
Even Senator Henry M. Jackson
(Dem.-Washington), the SST's foremost
champion, was definite on that count:
"It's dead," he said immediately after
Wednesday's vote.
How Jackson finally lost his fight is
not as definite. As the House vote—
which had been expected to go in favor
of the SST— approached, an intensive
(and highly nationalistic)
counter-attack by the aviation industry
appeared to have thrown a wrench into
Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire's
anti-SST crusade. Proxmire himself had
conceded. "It's the kind of campaign
I've seen pay off again and again in
Congress."
Stunning Defeat
But the blitzkrieg didn't pay off: the
vote, while nearly even, was a stunning
SST defeat.
Whether it was a grand victory for
the forces of ecology is quite another
question. The tally was also evenly
divided within the parties; despite
strong support for the appropriation
from President Nixon, nearly as many

Republicans voted against as for.
Indeed, the 'no' roster included some
Congressmen who have never been
notably ecologically inclined; some
Washington observers saw the SST as a
relatively 'safe' issue on which
Republicans could register their
dissatisfaction with the President— and
their dislike of Presidential aide John
Ehrlichmann.
By the beginning of last week, it was
difficult to make a strong case for
either side. Proponents relied on
appeals to American primacy in
aviation, even on the American 'sense
of adventure'; the opposition's
arguments rested on largely unproven
fears of ecological disaster. In the end,
it came down to a question of
priorities.
Staggering Effect
The effect on American aviation
cannot be immediately determined; no
one knows whether or not the SST
would have turned a profit. But the
effect on the unemployment situation
in Seattle (where Boeing is still the
largest employer) was swift and
staggering: company spokesmen
immediately announced that another
7000 employees would be released,

beginning this week. Those reductions
will bring Boeing's work force to some
4 0,000, down from over 100,000 two
years ago; and Seattle's unemployment
to something like 18%. The highest
nationwide unemployment reached
during the Depression of the thirites
was less than 14%.
The mood in Seattle last week was
understandably angry. Many workers at
Boeing are now just waiting for the ax
to fall— as are thousands of workers
outside Boeing, for it has been
estimated that every job lost on the
SST will mean two, three, or even four
jobs lost in supporting and service
industries. Some advocated hanging
Senator Proxmire; some wanted a
boycott of Wisconsin cheese.
All felt cheated, as though the
Congress had not seen what seemed to
be the obvious needs. As the Boeing
Co. said in an official statement
Thursday, "We believe that at some
future time the need for an
American-built SST will become
apparent. . . Hopefully, our nation will
then support this need. The grea»
economic benefits flowing to our
country from leadership in aircraft
manufacture and transportation should
be apparent to all."

ecological principles at all. Even less
clear are the implications for the future
of the American aerospace industry;
and the most puzzling, and in many
eyes the most important question, is
the effect of the death of the SST
project on the nation's soaring
unemployment— particularly in the
aerospace and electronics industries,
and particularly in the already hard-hit
Seattle area.
Despite recent rumor of a Japanese
interest in buying the SST "scrap pile"
— blueprints, mockups, research, and
tools— at ten cents on the dollar, and
some faint speculation that a group of
private business concerns would

miraculously appear, $300 million (the
plane's eventual cost) in hand, to
underwrite the project, it appears that
the only thing that could have saved
the 1800 mph jet was a federal subsidy.
Even Senator Henry M. Jackson
(Dem.-Washington), the SST's foremost
champion, was definite on that count:
"It's dead," he said immediately after
Wednesday's vote.
How Jackson finally lost his fight is
not as definite. As the House vote—
which had been expected to go in favor
of the SST— approached, an intensive
(and highly nationalistic)
counter-attack by the aviation industry
appeared to have thrown a wrench into
Wisconsin Senator William Proxmire's
anti-SST crusade. Proxmire himself had
conceded. "It's the kind of campaign
I've seen pay off again and again in
Congress."
Stunning Defeat
But the blitzkrieg didn't pay off: the
vote, while nearly even, was a stunning
SST defeat.
Whether it was a grand victory for
the forces of ecology is quite another
question. The tally was also evenly
divided within the parties; despite
strong support for the appropriation
from President Nixon, nearly as many

Republicans voted against as for.
Indeed, the 'no' roster included some
Congressmen who have never been
notably ecologically inclined; some
Washington observers saw the SST as a
relatively 'safe' issue on which
Republicans could register their
dissatisfaction with the President— and
their dislike of Presidential aide John
Ehrlichmann.
By the beginning of last week, it was
difficult to make a strong case for
either side. Proponents relied on
appeals to American primacy in
aviation, even on the American 'sense
of adventure'; the opposition's
arguments rested on largely unproven
fears of ecological disaster. In the end,
it came down to a question of
priorities.
Staggering Effect
The effect on American aviation
cannot be immediately determined; no
one knows whether or not the SST
would have turned a profit. But the
effect on the unemployment situation
in Seattle (where Boeing is still the
largest employer) was swift and
staggering: company spokesmen
immediately announced that another
7000 employees would be released,

beginning this week. Those reductions
will bring Boeing's work force to some
4 0,000, down from over 100,000 two
years ago; and Seattle's unemployment
to something like 18%. The highest
nationwide unemployment reached
during the Depression of the thirites
was less than 14%.
The mood in Seattle last week was
understandably angry. Many workers at
Boeing are now just waiting for the ax
to fall— as are thousands of workers
outside Boeing, for it has been
estimated that every job lost on the
SST will mean two, three, or even four
jobs lost in supporting and service
industries. Some advocated hanging
Senator Proxmire; some wanted a
boycott of Wisconsin cheese.
All felt cheated, as though the
Congress had not seen what seemed to
be the obvious needs. As the Boeing
Co. said in an official statement
Thursday, "We believe that at some
future time the need for an
American-built SST will become
apparent. . . Hopefully, our nation will
then support this need. The grea»
economic benefits flowing to our
country from leadership in aircraft
manufacture and transportation should
be apparent to all."
The Senate's 5 2 to 4 6 defeat of
funds for the American supersonic
transport last week, after a similar (and
equally surprising) House vote of 215
to 204, has effectively shot down the
last hopes for Boeing's big plane.
But just why the $134 million
appropriation, to have been used to
complete two SST prototypes, was
denied is unclear. While ecology
enthusiasts claim the vote as a major
victory, many congressmen do not
seem to have been motivated by
ecological principles at all. Even less
clear are the implications for the future
of the American aerospace industry;
and the most puzzling, and in many
eyes the most important question, is
the effect of the death of the SST
project on the nation's soaring
