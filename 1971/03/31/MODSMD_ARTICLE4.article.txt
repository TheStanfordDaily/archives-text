# Scientists Find Practical Uses For Versatile Laser

### RICHARD B. MILES STEVEN G. UNGAR 
(This is the second part of a three part series describing
the laser research at Stanford. In this part the research at
the Medical School and at the Hansen Laboratories of
Physics is described.)
The laser, once known as "the Incredible Laser," is a
new light source whose potential uses are as varied as the
light bulb. Originally viewed as the answer to man's
communication problems and a devastating weapon, now,
ten years after the first laser was built, the practical uses are
beginning to surface. The laser is a highly technical device,
and thus sees its most important applications in
sophisticated systems.
Certainly the military is the major user and developer
of advanced technology, and as such, has been closely
involved in the development and application of the laser.
Military uses have mostly been in the radar area; lasers
make very accurate radar systems. More recently lasers have
been used to guide missiles to targets. One can conceive of
many other military uses such as distant illumination, a
blinding flash system, a laser death ray, or some sort of
detection device. Lasers can also be used for complicated
radar signal processing.
Military applications tend to favor high power systems.
Some of the more elegant uses of lasers are not of such
direct importance on the battlefield. For example, lasers
are being used to study materials and molecular structure;
they have renovated the field of spectroscopy. These
research areas will probably find applications in pollution
studies, communications systems, and, some day, three
dimensional television.
A major area in which laser research is being performed
Ls at the Stanford Medical School, under the direction of
Dr. H. Christian Zweng. Dr. Zweng has developed a laser
photocoagulator, in conjunction with an engineering team
at the Stanford Research Institute. According to Dr.
Richard Honey of SRI, "The potential applications of
lasers are in working through transparent media like the
eye, and doing things inside that you don't want to do with
hammers and scissors and saws and so forth."
Dr. Zweng has been using lasers since 1963 to treat
patients for a variety of eye diseases, such as retinal tears
and diabetic retinopathy.
Commercial Demand
The new photocoagulator is being manufactured
commercially by a local laser company, and is in very high
demand. It makes operations once difficult or impossible,
so simple that they can be done in the doctor's office
without anesthetics.

The medical group is continuing research on treating eye
diseases with lasers, including experimenting with a laser
that actually burns a tiny hole in the eye to relieve the high
internal pressure associated with glaucoma.
By far the largest group working in lasers at Stanford
consists of four professors, three research associates, and
about a dozen graduate students, all working at the Hansen
Laboratory.
The backbone of this group is the team of Professor
Stephen E. Harris and his co-workers. They have become
well-known for the development of continuously tunable
lasers. Much of their work is now concentrated on
producing light especially suitable for spectroscopy,
developing new methods for changing the laser's color

rapidly, and using the tunable lasers they invented for
isotope separation and photochemistry.
Closely allied with professor Harris is one of his former
students, Professor Robert L. Byer. Professor Byer is now
involved in finding new methods for achieving tunable laser
radiation in other regions of the spectrum, such as the
infrared (or heat) portion of the spectrum.
Professors Byer and Harris, and Dr. James F. Young, a
research associate, feel that the major uses of these tunable
lasers will be in the study of materials. Although
approximately two thirds of their funding is from military
sources, they predict that most of the uses will be in
civilian areas, particularly in pollution detection and
spectroscopy.
Possible military uses are not hard to imagine. Certainly,

if developed into a military system, these lasers might be
used as radars or camouflage detectors, if not for other
things not yet conceived. The researchers emphasized,
however, that almost any new device can be used in a
military system, and that tunable lasers would probably not
be more suitable for military systems than are the lasers
that are now available.
Standard Of Length
Professor Anthony E. Siegman is also associated with
the Hansen Laboratories. Professor Seigman's work has
focused on the operation of lasers and how that operation
can be altered. He has done research on producing very
short laser pulses useful in communications and biological
systems studies, and on techniques of stabilizing a laser so
that it can be used as a standard of length.
His other work has consisted of theoretical calculations
and analysis of laser resonators. Some of this research has
found application in the high-power lasers now being made
by the military, an application he feels was not predictable
at the time the research was performed. He points out,
however, that all of the research at Stanford is unclassified
and distributed to the public through international
journals.
Professor Richard H. Pantell, who for years has been
associated with the Hansen Laboratories, has virtually left
the field of lasers, and is now becoming involved in
applying engineering to ecology. His associate. Dr. Harold
E. Puthoff, is also planning to leave laser research for a
more socially relevant area.
Ruby Red To Infra-red
Pantell's group has, like most of the other laser research
groups at Stanford, been involved in the development of
tunable lasers. They are currently doing work at the High
Energy Physics Laboratory in an attempt to produce an
ultra-violet laser. Their other experiments use certain
crystals to shift the red color of a ruby laser into the
infra-red.
Although Dr. Puthoff is leaving the field (for personal
reasons), he feels that laser research should be continued:
"I think that funding definitely ought to be increased in
socially relevant areas. There are certain areas 1 think are
really underfunded; so I'd like to see the funding ratio
increase. 1 don't think I'd like to see the laser funding level
reduced, because it takes the amount that's going on now
just to keep up with the positive aspects ot lasers, the
medical applications and things like that."
(The majority of laser projects at Stanford are funded
by agencies of the Department of Defense. Tomorrow, in
jxirt three of this scries, we explore the reaction of the
researchers to their source of funding.)

brick glow white hot.
