# Pigskin Prospects Brighten

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's football team will
be bolstered next season by the
addition of six top junior college
transfers, but freshman recruiting
has not gone as well as might have
been expected following the Rose
Bowl victory.
The six transfers are led by
Dennis Bragonier, a defensive
back from Hayward's Chabot
College. The 5-10, 180 pound
Bragonier was the player of the
year in the Golden Gate
Conference. He also saw action as
a wide receiver.
The other transfers are: Mike
Aseka, 6-3 225 pound tight end
from College of the Sequoias;
Chuck Cordes, 6-1 230 pound
guard from Ventura JC; Ron
Hancock, 6-3 230 pound
guard-tackle from Arizona
Western; Jim Merlo, 6-1 215
pound linebacker from Fresno
City College, and Barry Reynolds,
6-1 220 pound defensive tackle
from Citrus JC.
Assistant coach Mike White
said, "This is one of the finest
groups we've ever gotten. We feel
that all six guys have a chance to
play right away next year."
Unfortunately, Stanford has
not been as successful in
recruiting high school players for
next year. Three big Southern
Californian aces whom Stanford
was heavily recruiting all ended up
signing letters of intent for USC.
The three were wide receiver John
McKay Jr., quarterback Pat
Hayden and running back Allen
Carter.
McKay, son of the Trojan
coach, and Hayden were
record-setting teammates on the
same Bishop Amat High School
squad. Carter was one of the most
sought after running backs in the
country. All three are on the
South Shrine high school team.
Bears Look Tough
California has also had one of
its finest recruiting years ever. The
Bears have already gotten Pac-8
letters of intent from 18 junior

college players and 25 high school
prospects.
The preps are led by seven
Shrine performers including
quarterback Steve Bartkowski
from Buchser High School in
Santa Clara.
Four Shrine selectees have
signed letters of intent with
Stanford. The four are wide
receiver Jim Wilkey, tackle Dick
Lambert, defensive back Bob
Laidlaw and linebacker Forrie
Martin. Martin is an All-American
prep from Los Angeles.
Stanford has also received
conference letters of intent from
three out of state prospects. They
are wide receiver Bill Singler from
Medford, Oregon, running back
Rudolph Green from Austin,
Texas and guard Kenneth
Robinson from Dallas, Texas.
Singler, at 5-9 and 160 pounds,
has been compared to the
departing Randy Vataha in size
and speed.
The Indians are still trying for
several other out-of-state
prospects. The two most highly
sought are lineman Orrin Olsen
from Salt Lake City and end Pat
Donovan from Helena, Montana.
Olsen is the 6-3 220 pound
brother of Los Angeles Rams star
Merlin Olsen. Donovan is an
All-State basketball forward and
the state discus champion, as well
as a wide receiver. Since the
national letter-of-intent deadline
is not until May, it is doubtful
that these top out-of-state
prospects will decide before then.
Poor Recruiting Mystery
White said he could not think
of any one reason for the lack of
success Stanford has had in high
school recruiting this year. He
admitted that some kids may have
thought that Jim Plunkett was the
main reason for Stanford's success
and now that he's gone, they
aren't sure they'd be playing for a
winner.
This is one reason he feels next
year will be a focal year for
determining how strong future

recruiting will be. "We finally
destroyed the myth that we
couldn't win." As he pointed out,
next year will be the time for
Stanford to prove that their
successes were the result of a
strong football program and not
due to the presence of one
superstar.
The six transfers who will
probably play a role in
determining just how successful
next season will be, are all
enrolled and will be on hand for
the start of spring drills on April
17.

national rugby championship by winning four games in the Monterey Tournament held over spring
