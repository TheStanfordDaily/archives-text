# Ruggers Win Fourth Monterey Title
## 
### CLIFF NANCARROW 
Badmouthed all the way to
Monterey as being incapable of
capturing a fourth straight
national championship, Stanford's
rugby team handily defeated the
Sea Hawks and the BATS, rallied
dramatically to defeat the
Olympic Club, and then upended
the Peninsula Ramblers in the
final round of play to win the
Monterey Tournament and the
accompanying national honors.
Twenty-four of the nation's
finest rugby teams gathered in
Carmel over the first weekend of
Spring break for the two-day,
single elimination tournament to
decide the country's number one
team.
The sixteen non-seeded teams
squared off on Saturday morning
before the dew was off the grass
to determine the sides that would
move into competition with the
eight already on the ladder for the
championship. Stanford was
paired against the Sea Hawks of
Felton as the second round got
under way, and utilizing many of
the second team players who had

made the trip, easily knocked off
the club team from down South,
10-0.
Moving into the winner's
bracket of the third round, the
Tribe came up against their old
nemesis, the BATS. But Kip
Oxman converted several penalty
kick attempts into the margin
needed for victory, as the Indians
took the match 9-6.
By the time the semi-finals
were ready to start, all of the
other games had been concluded,
and all of the fans had crowded
around and were spilling onto the
field where Stanford was to meet
the Olympic Club of San
Francisco. For a long while, they
didn't have much to cheer about
as the "0" Club pulled into a 9-6

lead with less than two minutes to
play. Then Rich Keller took a pass
from scrum half Ray Wilson,
faked to Jim Kauffman cutting
back against the flow of the play,
and pitched to Jack Shultz cn the
wing. Shultz broke a tackle,
eluded another, and touched the
ball down squarely under the goal
posts for the try. Oxman's
conversion made it 11 -9. With less
than a minute to play, Chris
Fletcher pounced on a crazily
bouncing ball and carried it across
the goal line for another Stanford
score. Oxman's conversion made
it 16-9 just as the referee whistled
full time.
The Indians' momentum
carried them through Saturday

night's round of parties and into
the finale with the Ramblers, who
had beaten the Tribe during the
regular season. The Indians piled
up nine points on a try by
Kauffman and two Oxman
penalty kicks to defeat the
Ramblers, 9-6, and brought home
their fourth number one ranking
in as many vears.
