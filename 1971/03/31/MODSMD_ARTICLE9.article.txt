Stone Blames System
Or. Jeremy Stone, Director of the
Federation of American Scientists
(FAS), discussed the role of natural and
social scientists and engineers in
influencing national policy in his
lecture "Can the System Be Made to
Work" Monday night in the Physics
Tank.
The FAS, formed shortly after the
Manhattan Project because of the
scientific community's concern over
control of nuclear materials, is an active
lobby on Capitol Hill.
Dr. Stone, who earned a Ph.D. in
Mathematics at Stanford, spoke of
working within the system, getting
trapped by it, becoming pessimistic and
discouraged but nonetheless continuing
working "to avoid He pointed

out that an increasing number of
important national policy decisions are
being made by military experts.
"Senators have forgotten their jobs,
and Congress has lost its sense of
responsibility" he said. He quoted one
Senator as stating that, "Before the
Armed Services Committee, any man in
uniform can be heard," and
commented that the Committee is
exposed to a minimum of expert
civilain representation.
In answer to his own question,
"Why, 20 years after nuclear war has
been recognized as mutual suicide, does
it continue to be a very real
possibility?" he pointed to an
international trend of Parliaments
losing power to national executives.
In the United States, he said, the
executive branch is a "democratic

centralist" organization almost by law.
While testifying before the Armed
Services Committee two weeks ago,
Stone went on record with a statement
to this effect when a Senator posed a
question using the phrase which is
usually a term applied to communist
concentration of power in a few men
and assumed compliance by all lesser
officials.
Dr. Stone pointed out that forms of
government are merely reflections of
the prevailing attitudes of the people.
"Centuries after Americans wanted to
make George Washington king," he
said, "they still regard the Presidency
with an unrealistic reverence. It's a bad
idea to feel everything in the executive
branch must be supported. This sort of
loyalty has people too easily bemused.
And the public should have less respect

for the President. If we question a man
before election we ought to hold the
same attitude after he is elected."
r lTie FAS is attempting to reactivate
a local chapter in the Stanford area.
Stanford professor Sidney Drell was
recently elected one of the
organizations 24 national Council
members.
Tretidder Boycott
By CARLA KALLAN
The United Stanford Employees
(USE) stepped up their boycotting
activities at Tresidder Union yesterday
by interfering with the 6:00 a.m.
delivery of bread, milk, and produce by
drivers from the Teamsters Union.
James Berk and other members of
USE informed truck drivers that "this
is an employees strike," and threatened
to overturn and damage their vehicles if
they did not withdraw. The drivers
complied, but returned at 7:00 a.m.
under Stanford police escort to
complete their deliveries.
Last Sunday, the USE group, of
between eight and 12 young men and
women, picketed various Tresidder
entrances and the variety store.
Monday, the group invaded the scullery
and dishroom of the union, urging
employees to walk out. They left on
the order of a Tresidder staff member.
Yesterday afternoon, the pickets
continued to carry signs demanding the
reinstatement of 12 employees laid off
last month because of a lack of
business. An "alternative food service"
has been set up by the pickets in front
of the union.
While the pickets claim that business
has been cut in half, by their activities
Forrest Tregea, Director of Tresidder
and the Faculty Club, termed business
"normal," although sales "might be
better" without the pickets, he said.

Treaty On Ballot
The Student Senate last night voted
to place a "Joint Treaty of Peace
Between the U.S. and Vietnamese
People" on the April 7 and 8 primary
ballot. The preamble of the treaty,
which will be printed in its entirety on
Friday, declares that the "American
and Vietnamese people are not
enemies," and that the war must end so
that "both peoples can live under the
joy of independence and can devote to
building a society based on human
equality and respect for the earth."
Library Surveillance
Cameras and staff reporting are
being used to combat the vandalism at
the Main Library according to Mr.
David Weber, director of University
Libraries on KZSU last night. People
who have caused damage have been
identified as non-employees and the
evidence has been forwarded to the
Administration.
