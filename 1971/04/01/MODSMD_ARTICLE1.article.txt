# Hoover Foundations Falter
## 
### STEVEN M. SCOTT 
Stanford University will spend an estimated 1.7 million dollars of its academic
reserve fund in order to reset the foundations of Hoover Tower, according to a
reliable source in the Planning Office.
An engineering report compiled in secret predicts that within five years Hoover
Tower will collapse in the general direction of the Main Quadrangle unless
preventive measures are taken.
The tower houses a million-volume library founded by Herbert Hoover during
World War I to preserve the "fugutive documents" of the conflict which would
have quickly disappeared otherwise.
The Planning Office will officially release the engineering report along with its
plarjs for resetting the foundations at a press conference set for 10 a.m. this
morning. Work on the foundations is scheduled to begin a week from next
Monday.
'Hie University has only been aware of a possible problem for a very short time.
In the wake of the February 9 Los Angeles earthquake, staff members of the
Hoover Library became concerned over several large vertical cracks in the
prestressed concrete walls of the basement.
The cracks, which previously had gone unnoticed, caused great alarm. The
Planning Office assured Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, that
they were the result of an anticipated settling of the foundations.
Contacted by the Daily last night, Campbell stated he put great pressure on the
Planning Office to investigate further. "I didn't want to be running a confounded
leaning tower of Stanford for tourists," he explained.
Secret Consultants
Then, on February 22, the Oakland engineering consultants, Shaw, Davies&
Sands, were hired secretly by the Planning Office to assess the extent of the
problem.
The conclusion of the firm's report, delivered three weeks later, reads in part,
"liquefaction of clay beneath the foundations along the western side of the
structure (facing the Quad) has caused it to tilt. This process is so grave that
within five years we predict a complete collapse."
In layman's terms, the ground on which the western foundations are laid is
under such great pressure that it has begun to flow and be displaced like a liquid.
Serra Street, which runs in front of Hoover tower, was closed last January
because of this same liquefaction. .Any attempt to resurface the street would have
been short-lived, because the ground underneath is being continuously deformed.
Possible Collapse
The report concluded that Hoover Tower will collapse onto the Nathan
Cummings Art Building if corrective action is not taken. As outlined by the
report, there are two possible measures:
— Dismantling the top six stories of the tower, including the dome and the
chimes, to reduce pressure on the foundations to the point where liquefaction is
negligible.
—Immediately resetting the foundations on the west side about twenty feet
deeper on granite bedrock, rather than the clay which has proven so unstable.
Unless work on the foundations starts "within at least two months," the firm
warns, "it will be virtually impossible to undo the damage." When the report was
finished two weeks ago, the top of Hoover Tower had already swayed 17 inches to
the right, as seen from the steps of Mem Aud.
Lean Will Reach 3 Feet
If the work is not well underway by next August or September, when the
amount of lean is predicted to reach three feet, there will be no alternative but to
begin dismantling the upper half of the tower.
Due to the rapidity with which this must be done, a conventional procedure
requiring about two years and costing five to seven hundred thousand dollars is
impossible. On the advice of its consultants, Stanford has decided to adopt a
much more complex but speedy method, costing nearly 1.7 million dollars.
After high-powered boring equipment has been used to excavate under the west
side of the tower, and four giant cranes have been positioned next to the tower to
brace it, jacks will be placed on the granite bedrock twenty feet below the present
foundations. Once the tower has been pushed back to its original position, new
and firmer foundations will be set.
The University places great importance on saving Hoover Tower. Part of a
statement released by the Planning Office reads, "The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an outstanding resource not only for Stanford, but also
for the West Coast, the nation, and the civilized world.

"This monument should remain a proud symbol of the University's
unquenched resolve to disseminate a spirit of enlightenment towards peace in an
age darkened by the possibility of nuclear war. It is clear that money alone does
not accomplish these objectives. But in this case, considering the dramatic impact
which Hoover Tower has on the appearance of the Stanford campus, it is
eminently desirable to expend whatever effort is needed to maintain it as it
stands.
"We ask the cooperation of the whole Stanford community in facing this
sudden crisis."
When reached last night, President Richard Lyman admitted the tower was
leaning "a little bit," but added he was unwilling to comment further at the time.
It seems that such a catastrophe has been a possibility in the minds of many
Stanford professors and students since the tower was first built.
When it was discovered during the tower's construction that it would be 22 feet
short of the Berkeley Campanile, rumors spread which laid the blame on the
architect, Arthur Brown Jr. Brown was accused of being a personal friend of many
members of the U.C. Board of Regents at that time.
Enraged alumni accused Brown of sabotaging the structure of Hoover Tower in
other ways.
Several years ago, a short paper was discovered written by the famed Stanford
geologist, Bailey Willis, who predicted that Hoover Tower would fall within fifty
years of its dedication. He condemned what he called "insufficient care in
designing and laying the foundations," based on "unduly hasty geologists' reports
of the site."
It now appears that the report was published two months after the tower was
built, but was almost completely ignored. Willis' reputation had already suffered
greatly from a widely popularized controversey in which he claimed the Golden
Gate Bridge would collapse and block the harbor of San Francisco if an
earthquake occurred.

the right, as seen from the steps of Mem Aud.
Lean Will Reach 3 Feet
If the work is not well underway by next August or September, when the
amount of lean is predicted to reach three feet, there will be no alternative but to
begin dismantling the upper half of the tower.
Due to the rapidity with which this must be done, a conventional procedure
requiring about two years and costing five to seven hundred thousand dollars is
impossible. On the advice of its consultants, Stanford has decided to adopt a
much more complex but speedy method, costing nearly 1.7 million dollars.
After high-powered boring equipment has been used to excavate under the west
side of the tower, and four giant cranes have been positioned next to the tower to
brace it, jacks will be placed on the granite bedrock twenty feet below the present
foundations. Once the tower has been pushed back to its original position, new
and firmer foundations will be set.
The University places great importance on saving Hoover Tower. Part of a
statement released by the Planning Office reads, "The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an outstanding resource not only for Stanford, but also
for the West Coast, the nation, and the civilized world.

"This monument should remain a proud symbol of the University's
unquenched resolve to disseminate a spirit of enlightenment towards peace in an
age darkened by the possibility of nuclear war. It is clear that money alone does
not accomplish these objectives. But in this case, considering the dramatic impact
which Hoover Tower has on the appearance of the Stanford campus, it is
eminently desirable to expend whatever effort is needed to maintain it as it
stands.
"We ask the cooperation of the whole Stanford community in facing this
sudden crisis."
When reached last night, President Richard Lyman admitted the tower was
leaning "a little bit," but added he was unwilling to comment further at the time.
It seems that such a catastrophe has been a possibility in the minds of many
Stanford professors and students since the tower was first built.
When it was discovered during the tower's construction that it would be 22 feet
short of the Berkeley Campanile, rumors spread which laid the blame on the
architect, Arthur Brown Jr. Brown was accused of being a personal friend of many
members of the U.C. Board of Regents at that time.
Enraged alumni accused Brown of sabotaging the structure of Hoover Tower in
other ways.
Several years ago, a short paper was discovered written by the famed Stanford
geologist, Bailey Willis, who predicted that Hoover Tower would fall within fifty
years of its dedication. He condemned what he called "insufficient care in
designing and laying the foundations," based on "unduly hasty geologists' reports
of the site."
It now appears that the report was published two months after the tower was
built, but was almost completely ignored. Willis' reputation had already suffered
greatly from a widely popularized controversey in which he claimed the Golden
Gate Bridge would collapse and block the harbor of San Francisco if an
earthquake occurred.

MILLION DOLLAR CRACKS—Discolorations in the concrete near the base of
Hoover Tower were made by engineers assaying the damage done to the tower by
liquifaction of the ground under the west side. The marks are on the south side
(facing the Main Library). The crakcs, below the surface of the earth, are visible
only in the basement of the tower.
Stanford University will spend an estimated 1.7 million dollars of its academic
reserve fund in order to reset the foundations of Hoover Tower, according to a
reliable source in the Planning Office.
An engineering report compiled in secret predicts that within five years Hoover
Tower will collapse in the general direction of the Main Quadrangle unless
preventive measures are taken.
The tower houses a million-volume library founded by Herbert Hoover during
World War I to preserve the "fugutive documents" of the conflict which would
have quickly disappeared otherwise.
The Planning Office will officially release the engineering report along with its
plarjs for resetting the foundations at a press conference set for 10 a.m. this
morning. Work on the foundations is scheduled to begin a week from next
Monday.
'Hie University has only been aware of a possible problem for a very short time.
In the wake of the February 9 Los Angeles earthquake, staff members of the
Hoover Library became concerned over several large vertical cracks in the
prestressed concrete walls of the basement.
The cracks, which previously had gone unnoticed, caused great alarm. The
Planning Office assured Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, that
they were the result of an anticipated settling of the foundations.
Contacted by the Daily last night, Campbell stated he put great pressure on the
Planning Office to investigate further. "I didn't want to be running a confounded
leaning tower of Stanford for tourists," he explained.
Secret Consultants
Then, on February 22, the Oakland engineering consultants, Shaw, Davies&
Sands, were hired secretly by the Planning Office to assess the extent of the
problem.
The conclusion of the firm's report, delivered three weeks later, reads in part,
"liquefaction of clay beneath the foundations along the western side of the
structure (facing the Quad) has caused it to tilt. This process is so grave that
within five years we predict a complete collapse."
In layman's terms, the ground on which the western foundations are laid is
under such great pressure that it has begun to flow and be displaced like a liquid.
Serra Street, which runs in front of Hoover tower, was closed last January
because of this same liquefaction. .Any attempt to resurface the street would have
been short-lived, because the ground underneath is being continuously deformed.
Possible Collapse
The report concluded that Hoover Tower will collapse onto the Nathan
Cummings Art Building if corrective action is not taken. As outlined by the
report, there are two possible measures:
— Dismantling the top six stories of the tower, including the dome and the
chimes, to reduce pressure on the foundations to the point where liquefaction is
negligible.
—Immediately resetting the foundations on the west side about twenty feet
deeper on granite bedrock, rather than the clay which has proven so unstable.
Unless work on the foundations starts "within at least two months," the firm
warns, "it will be virtually impossible to undo the damage." When the report was
finished two weeks ago, the top of Hoover Tower had already swayed 17 inches to
the right, as seen from the steps of Mem Aud.

MILLION DOLLAR CRACKS—Discolorations in the concrete near the base of
Hoover Tower were made by engineers assaying the damage done to the tower by
liquifaction of the ground under the west side. The marks are on the south side
(facing the Main Library). The crakcs, below the surface of the earth, are visible
only in the basement of the tower.
Stanford University will spend an estimated 1.7 million dollars of its academic
reserve fund in order to reset the foundations of Hoover Tower, according to a
reliable source in the Planning Office.
An engineering report compiled in secret predicts that within five years Hoover
Tower will collapse in the general direction of the Main Quadrangle unless
preventive measures are taken.
The tower houses a million-volume library founded by Herbert Hoover during
World War I to preserve the "fugutive documents" of the conflict which would
have quickly disappeared otherwise.
The Planning Office will officially release the engineering report along with its
plarjs for resetting the foundations at a press conference set for 10 a.m. this
morning. Work on the foundations is scheduled to begin a week from next
Monday.
'Hie University has only been aware of a possible problem for a very short time.
In the wake of the February 9 Los Angeles earthquake, staff members of the
Hoover Library became concerned over several large vertical cracks in the
prestressed concrete walls of the basement.
The cracks, which previously had gone unnoticed, caused great alarm. The
Planning Office assured Glenn Campbell, director of the Hoover Institution, that
they were the result of an anticipated settling of the foundations.
Contacted by the Daily last night, Campbell stated he put great pressure on the
Planning Office to investigate further. "I didn't want to be running a confounded
leaning tower of Stanford for tourists," he explained.
Secret Consultants
Then, on February 22, the Oakland engineering consultants, Shaw, Davies&
Sands, were hired secretly by the Planning Office to assess the extent of the
problem.
The conclusion of the firm's report, delivered three weeks later, reads in part,
"liquefaction of clay beneath the foundations along the western side of the
structure (facing the Quad) has caused it to tilt. This process is so grave that
within five years we predict a complete collapse."
In layman's terms, the ground on which the western foundations are laid is
under such great pressure that it has begun to flow and be displaced like a liquid.
Serra Street, which runs in front of Hoover tower, was closed last January
because of this same liquefaction. .Any attempt to resurface the street would have
been short-lived, because the ground underneath is being continuously deformed.
Possible Collapse
The report concluded that Hoover Tower will collapse onto the Nathan
Cummings Art Building if corrective action is not taken. As outlined by the
report, there are two possible measures:
— Dismantling the top six stories of the tower, including the dome and the
chimes, to reduce pressure on the foundations to the point where liquefaction is
negligible.
—Immediately resetting the foundations on the west side about twenty feet
deeper on granite bedrock, rather than the clay which has proven so unstable.
Unless work on the foundations starts "within at least two months," the firm
warns, "it will be virtually impossible to undo the damage." When the report was
finished two weeks ago, the top of Hoover Tower had already swayed 17 inches to
the right, as seen from the steps of Mem Aud.
Lean Will Reach 3 Feet
If the work is not well underway by next August or September, when the
amount of lean is predicted to reach three feet, there will be no alternative but to
begin dismantling the upper half of the tower.
Due to the rapidity with which this must be done, a conventional procedure
requiring about two years and costing five to seven hundred thousand dollars is
impossible. On the advice of its consultants, Stanford has decided to adopt a
much more complex but speedy method, costing nearly 1.7 million dollars.
After high-powered boring equipment has been used to excavate under the west
side of the tower, and four giant cranes have been positioned next to the tower to
brace it, jacks will be placed on the granite bedrock twenty feet below the present
foundations. Once the tower has been pushed back to its original position, new
and firmer foundations will be set.
The University places great importance on saving Hoover Tower. Part of a
statement released by the Planning Office reads, "The Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace is an outstanding resource not only for Stanford, but also
for the West Coast, the nation, and the civilized world.

"This monument should remain a proud symbol of the University's
unquenched resolve to disseminate a spirit of enlightenment towards peace in an
age darkened by the possibility of nuclear war. It is clear that money alone does
not accomplish these objectives. But in this case, considering the dramatic impact
which Hoover Tower has on the appearance of the Stanford campus, it is
eminently desirable to expend whatever effort is needed to maintain it as it
stands.
"We ask the cooperation of the whole Stanford community in facing this
sudden crisis."
When reached last night, President Richard Lyman admitted the tower was
leaning "a little bit," but added he was unwilling to comment further at the time.
It seems that such a catastrophe has been a possibility in the minds of many
Stanford professors and students since the tower was first built.
When it was discovered during the tower's construction that it would be 22 feet
short of the Berkeley Campanile, rumors spread which laid the blame on the
architect, Arthur Brown Jr. Brown was accused of being a personal friend of many
members of the U.C. Board of Regents at that time.
Enraged alumni accused Brown of sabotaging the structure of Hoover Tower in
other ways.
Several years ago, a short paper was discovered written by the famed Stanford
geologist, Bailey Willis, who predicted that Hoover Tower would fall within fifty
years of its dedication. He condemned what he called "insufficient care in
designing and laying the foundations," based on "unduly hasty geologists' reports
of the site."
It now appears that the report was published two months after the tower was
built, but was almost completely ignored. Willis' reputation had already suffered
greatly from a widely popularized controversey in which he claimed the Golden
Gate Bridge would collapse and block the harbor of San Francisco if an
earthquake occurred.
