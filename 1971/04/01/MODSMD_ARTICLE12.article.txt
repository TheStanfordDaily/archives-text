## Italy Campus To Renovate Program 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford in Italy, considered by
many to be the finest all around
program in the Overseas Campuses
system, is currently facing the
same drop in student applications
that is affecting some of the other
European campuses.
For the first time in its 11 -year
history, the Stanford Villa in the
foothills of Florence may have
numerous empty beds. Students
dropping out of the program just
prior to their departure date has
cut the size of the current group
in Florence by nearly 10 percent,
and the group going to Italy in
September will be enlarged by the
addition of a group of women
from Mills College, an
arrangement used to fill vacancies
at several Overseas Campuses in
the past.
But campus administrators and
the Subcommittee on Stanford in
Italy are moving to change the
program in Florence in an attempt

to reflect the new concerns of
students and to boost attendance.
Plans call for a new Italian
relevance in courses presented by
Stanford professors, increased
emphasis on local courses and
colloquia, and a fully revised
system of language study all
beginning next September.
"Brand New Start"
Dr. Guelfo Frulla, Director of
the academic program at the
campus, described the changes as
"a brand new start for the
program." Changes in the
language instruction are currently
being tried on an experimental
basis.
In his own inimitable, animated
style, the smiling Frulla explained
the specifics of the new approach
and why they were being
implemented. "We heard some
very positive and useful
suggestions from the last Italy
group," he said, "and we knew
both the students and the Villa
staff wanted a change. We all felt
the need for a reviewing of our
program - a breath of the fresh
air."
Realizing the need to review
and improve Italian speaking
ability early in the stay, the new
plan calls for an intensive four
week language training period as
soon as the students arrive in
Florence. This would include
grammar and conversational
practice for perhaps three hours a
day, followed by walking tours of
the city and short field trips to
towns in the Tuscany area to
introduce students to the country
surrounding Florence.
Contact With The People
After the orientation period,
language classes would become
four unit colloquia dealing with

defined subject matter (sucli as
The Italian People, or The
Florentine Artisans) stressing
conversational abilities. These
classes would require interviews
with Italian university students,
craftsmen, and homemakers, and
reports including drawings or
photographs concerning various
contacts students have with
Italians, such as in traveling or
visiting native families.
Currently Italian classes are
made up of grammar and
literature study for six units per
quarter.
"This new plan," stated Frulla,
"will make Florence come into
the classroom. And it keeps both
the students and teachers from
becoming bored."
Emphasis On Local Courses
Local courses, taught by Italian
instructors, are currently given for
two units on such subjects as
Florentine Art, Michaelangelo,
Italian Political History, and the
Rennaissance in Italy. Under the
new set-up, the local courses
would be given for four units, the
same as all the other courses, and
developed into local colloquia
taught in Italian during the second
quarter of a group's stay. Noted
political scientist, Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, Director of
Administration for

Stanford-in-Italy, is currently
preparing a new course on Modern
Italy, to be offered during the
llrst quarter under the new
program.
Believing more students will be
drawn to the campus by an
excellent academic program
relating to the country of Italy,
and Europe in general, Frulla is
pleased with the courses to be
offered by Stanford professors in
coming years.
Professors such as William
Chase, English, and David
Kennedy, History, (a student in
the first Italy group), will be
traveling to Florence (Fall-Winter,
19 72-73 ) to teach such courses as:
"Dante and Modern Imagination,"
(Chase), "Ezra Pound Italy,"
(Chase), and "American Images of
the Old World," (Kennedy).
Fellow of the University Mark
Mancall, History, will go with the
group after that to teach courses
including: "Italian Film as a
Medium for Expression of Italian
Social Thought," and "Marxist
Socialist Thought in Italy."
Students would still be able to
take directed reading courses to
vary their course load between
12-18 units.
Special academic schedules are
currently being created especially
for those who have spent six

months in Florence and wish to
return for a quarter.
Reasons For Decline
Overseas campus officials cite
increased individual travel to
Europe, financial problems, and
the dropping of the University
language requirement as three of
the major reasons for the drop in
attendance at campuses on the
continent. As a result, the
language requirement for overseas
campuses has been reduced for
the campuses in Austria and
Germany, and may be reduced for
Italy. The program has been
opened to graduate students,
third-quarter freshmen, and
returnees, in an attempt to deal
with the fluctuations in
applications.
Special concern is voiced about
a campus such as that in Italy
because practically no American
high school teaches Italian and
many students tend to view the
language as of no use for anyplace
besides that one country.
But Frulla is not overly
concerned about his campus. "I
don't worry in the least," he said
with a grin. "As soon as they
know we have such good
professors and courses, they will
flock again. 'I'hey must— the
Florentine experience is so
unique."

Florentine Artisans) stressing
conversational abilities. These
classes would require interviews
with Italian university students,
craftsmen, and homemakers, and
reports including drawings or
photographs concerning various
contacts students have with
Italians, such as in traveling or
visiting native families.
Currently Italian classes are
made up of grammar and
literature study for six units per
quarter.
"This new plan," stated Frulla,
"will make Florence come into
the classroom. And it keeps both
the students and teachers from
becoming bored."
Emphasis On Local Courses
Local courses, taught by Italian
instructors, are currently given for
two units on such subjects as
Florentine Art, Michaelangelo,
Italian Political History, and the
Rennaissance in Italy. Under the
new set-up, the local courses
would be given for four units, the
same as all the other courses, and
developed into local colloquia
taught in Italian during the second
quarter of a group's stay. Noted
political scientist, Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, Director of
Administration for

Stanford-in-Italy, is currently
preparing a new course on Modern
Italy, to be offered during the
llrst quarter under the new
program.
Believing more students will be
drawn to the campus by an
excellent academic program
relating to the country of Italy,
and Europe in general, Frulla is
pleased with the courses to be
offered by Stanford professors in
coming years.
Professors such as William
Chase, English, and David
Kennedy, History, (a student in
the first Italy group), will be
traveling to Florence (Fall-Winter,
19 72-73 ) to teach such courses as:
"Dante and Modern Imagination,"
(Chase), "Ezra Pound Italy,"
(Chase), and "American Images of
the Old World," (Kennedy).
Fellow of the University Mark
Mancall, History, will go with the
group after that to teach courses
including: "Italian Film as a
Medium for Expression of Italian
Social Thought," and "Marxist
Socialist Thought in Italy."
Students would still be able to
take directed reading courses to
vary their course load between
12-18 units.
Special academic schedules are
currently being created especially
for those who have spent six

months in Florence and wish to
return for a quarter.
Reasons For Decline
Overseas campus officials cite
increased individual travel to
Europe, financial problems, and
the dropping of the University
language requirement as three of
the major reasons for the drop in
attendance at campuses on the
continent. As a result, the
language requirement for overseas
campuses has been reduced for
the campuses in Austria and
Germany, and may be reduced for
Italy. The program has been
opened to graduate students,
third-quarter freshmen, and
returnees, in an attempt to deal
with the fluctuations in
applications.
Special concern is voiced about
a campus such as that in Italy
because practically no American
high school teaches Italian and
many students tend to view the
language as of no use for anyplace
besides that one country.
But Frulla is not overly
concerned about his campus. "I
don't worry in the least," he said
with a grin. "As soon as they
know we have such good
professors and courses, they will
flock again. 'I'hey must— the
Florentine experience is so
unique."

ALWAYS SMlLlNG—Director of Academic Affairs at
Stanford-in-Italy, Dr. Guelfo Frulla is never without a huge grin, even
when his campus, like some of the other overseas programs, faces a
shortage of students for the first time in its history.
Stanford in Italy, considered by
many to be the finest all around
program in the Overseas Campuses
system, is currently facing the
same drop in student applications
that is affecting some of the other
European campuses.
For the first time in its 11 -year
history, the Stanford Villa in the
foothills of Florence may have
numerous empty beds. Students
dropping out of the program just
prior to their departure date has
cut the size of the current group
in Florence by nearly 10 percent,
and the group going to Italy in
September will be enlarged by the
addition of a group of women
from Mills College, an
arrangement used to fill vacancies
at several Overseas Campuses in
the past.
But campus administrators and
the Subcommittee on Stanford in
Italy are moving to change the
program in Florence in an attempt

to reflect the new concerns of
students and to boost attendance.
Plans call for a new Italian
relevance in courses presented by
Stanford professors, increased
emphasis on local courses and
colloquia, and a fully revised
system of language study all
beginning next September.
"Brand New Start"
Dr. Guelfo Frulla, Director of
the academic program at the
campus, described the changes as
"a brand new start for the
program." Changes in the
language instruction are currently
being tried on an experimental
basis.
In his own inimitable, animated
style, the smiling Frulla explained
the specifics of the new approach
and why they were being
implemented. "We heard some
very positive and useful
suggestions from the last Italy
group," he said, "and we knew
both the students and the Villa
staff wanted a change. We all felt
the need for a reviewing of our
program - a breath of the fresh
air."
Realizing the need to review
and improve Italian speaking
ability early in the stay, the new
plan calls for an intensive four
week language training period as
soon as the students arrive in
Florence. This would include
grammar and conversational
practice for perhaps three hours a
day, followed by walking tours of
the city and short field trips to
towns in the Tuscany area to
introduce students to the country
surrounding Florence.
Contact With The People
After the orientation period,
language classes would become
four unit colloquia dealing with

defined subject matter (sucli as
The Italian People, or The
Florentine Artisans) stressing
conversational abilities. These
classes would require interviews
with Italian university students,
craftsmen, and homemakers, and
reports including drawings or
photographs concerning various
contacts students have with
Italians, such as in traveling or
visiting native families.
Currently Italian classes are
made up of grammar and
literature study for six units per

increased individual travel to
Europe, financial problems, and
the dropping of the University
language requirement as three of
the major reasons for the drop in
attendance at campuses on the
continent. As a result, the
language requirement for overseas
campuses has been reduced for
the campuses in Austria and
Germany, and may be reduced for
Italy. The program has been
opened to graduate students,
third-quarter freshmen, and
returnees, in an attempt to deal
with the fluctuations in
applications.
Special concern is voiced about
a campus such as that in Italy
because practically no American
high school teaches Italian and
many students tend to view the
language as of no use for anyplace
besides that one country.
But Frulla is not overly
concerned about his campus. "I
don't worry in the least," he said
with a grin. "As soon as they
know we have such good
professors and courses, they will
flock again. 'I'hey must— the
Florentine experience is so

ALWAYS SMlLlNG—Director of Academic Affairs at
Stanford-in-Italy, Dr. Guelfo Frulla is never without a huge grin, even
when his campus, like some of the other overseas programs, faces a
shortage of students for the first time in its history.
Stanford in Italy, considered by
many to be the finest all around
program in the Overseas Campuses
system, is currently facing the
same drop in student applications
that is affecting some of the other
European campuses.
For the first time in its 11 -year
history, the Stanford Villa in the
foothills of Florence may have
numerous empty beds. Students
dropping out of the program just
prior to their departure date has
cut the size of the current group
in Florence by nearly 10 percent,
and the group going to Italy in
September will be enlarged by the
addition of a group of women
from Mills College, an
arrangement used to fill vacancies
at several Overseas Campuses in
the past.
But campus administrators and
the Subcommittee on Stanford in
Italy are moving to change the
program in Florence in an attempt

to reflect the new concerns of
students and to boost attendance.
Plans call for a new Italian
relevance in courses presented by
Stanford professors, increased
emphasis on local courses and
colloquia, and a fully revised
system of language study all
beginning next September.
"Brand New Start"
Dr. Guelfo Frulla, Director of
the academic program at the
campus, described the changes as
"a brand new start for the
program." Changes in the
language instruction are currently
being tried on an experimental
basis.
In his own inimitable, animated
style, the smiling Frulla explained
the specifics of the new approach
and why they were being
implemented. "We heard some
very positive and useful
suggestions from the last Italy
group," he said, "and we knew
both the students and the Villa
staff wanted a change. We all felt
the need for a reviewing of our
program - a breath of the fresh
air."
Realizing the need to review
and improve Italian speaking
ability early in the stay, the new
plan calls for an intensive four
week language training period as
soon as the students arrive in
Florence. This would include
grammar and conversational
practice for perhaps three hours a
day, followed by walking tours of
the city and short field trips to
towns in the Tuscany area to
introduce students to the country
surrounding Florence.
Contact With The People
After the orientation period,
language classes would become
four unit colloquia dealing with

defined subject matter (sucli as
The Italian People, or The
Florentine Artisans) stressing
conversational abilities. These
classes would require interviews
with Italian university students,
craftsmen, and homemakers, and
reports including drawings or
photographs concerning various
contacts students have with
Italians, such as in traveling or
visiting native families.
Currently Italian classes are
made up of grammar and
literature study for six units per
quarter.
"This new plan," stated Frulla,
"will make Florence come into
the classroom. And it keeps both
the students and teachers from
becoming bored."
Emphasis On Local Courses
Local courses, taught by Italian
instructors, are currently given for
two units on such subjects as
Florentine Art, Michaelangelo,
Italian Political History, and the
Rennaissance in Italy. Under the
new set-up, the local courses
would be given for four units, the
same as all the other courses, and
developed into local colloquia
taught in Italian during the second
quarter of a group's stay. Noted
political scientist, Dr. Giuseppe
Mammarella, Director of
Administration for

Stanford-in-Italy, is currently
preparing a new course on Modern
Italy, to be offered during the
llrst quarter under the new
program.
Believing more students will be
drawn to the campus by an
excellent academic program
relating to the country of Italy,
and Europe in general, Frulla is
pleased with the courses to be
offered by Stanford professors in
coming years.
Professors such as William
Chase, English, and David
Kennedy, History, (a student in
the first Italy group), will be
traveling to Florence (Fall-Winter,
19 72-73 ) to teach such courses as:
"Dante and Modern Imagination,"
(Chase), "Ezra Pound Italy,"
(Chase), and "American Images of
the Old World," (Kennedy).
Fellow of the University Mark
Mancall, History, will go with the
group after that to teach courses
including: "Italian Film as a
Medium for Expression of Italian
Social Thought," and "Marxist
Socialist Thought in Italy."
Students would still be able to
take directed reading courses to
vary their course load between
12-18 units.
Special academic schedules are
currently being created especially
for those who have spent six

months in Florence and wish to
return for a quarter.
Reasons For Decline
Overseas campus officials cite
increased individual travel to
Europe, financial problems, and
the dropping of the University
