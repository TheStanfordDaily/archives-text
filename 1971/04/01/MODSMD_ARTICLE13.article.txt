# Money Woes Main Barrier In Daily Independence Move
## 
### 
As the Daily moves toward eventual
independence from the University, the biggest
stumbling block continues to be a financial one.
Past losses and declining revenues are hindering
efforts to ensure the future financial and editorial
independence of the paper.
Currently, a number of groups are conducting
studies to determine both the feasibility and
manner in which the Daily can sever its ties with
the University. At the recommendation of
President Lyman, the Dean of Students' Office is
studying the problem, with the aid of Miles
Schlossberg, a law-business student, who is
preparing a list of recommendations for the
reorganization of the Daily staff.
In addition, a SVVOPSI course is focusing on the
matter, dealing not only with financial questions
but also with legal and organizational difficulties
facing an independent Daily.
The financial woes of the Daily are its greatest
problem. Approximately one-fourth of the Dailly's
budget comes from student, faculty, and staff
subscriptions, with advertising providing the
remaining revenue. The funds for subscriptions
come indirectly, through university and ASSU
funds, and can be cut either by University action,
or by the student body in its annual fee setting
election. Currently, each student pays $1 per
quarter for the Daily, while the university this year
paid $1,000 for faculty and staff subscriptions.

In addition, the ASSU has loaned $20,000 to
cover Daily losses for the past two years. During
the 1968-69 school year, the paper lost $8,000,
while last year the deficit was $12,000. These
loans must be repayed before the paper can
become independent.
According to Business Manager Brian Hardy, the
financial problem is chiefly a result of a decline in
advertising. While local advertising has remained
steady over the past several years, a drastic decline
in national advertising has occurred. "We are
running 60 percent behind of nationally
distributed advertising in past years, and that's
more than any recession should do," notes Hardy.
A reorganization of the business staff is already
underway. Hardy is forming a sales force to sell
more ads for the paper, recruiting all interested
persons to work for themselves, and the paper,
receiving a commission.
In addition, the Daily is running a higher
percentage of advertising than in the past. The
paper is currently running at a profit, and Hardy
anticipates that its debts can be repaid over three
years.
Organization of the business and editorial staffs
has been clarified by the creation of an "Editor in
Chief' to assume full responsibility for all
operations of the newspaper, reducing confusion
between the two staffs.

A reorganization of the business staff is already
underway. Hardy is forming a sales force to sell
more ads for the paper, recruiting all interested
persons to work for themselves, and the paper,
receiving a commission.
In addition, the Daily is running a higher
percentage of advertising than in the past. The
paper is currently running at a profit, and Hardy
anticipates that its debts can be repaid over three
years.
Organization of the business and editorial staffs
has been clarified by the creation of an "Editor in
Chief' to assume full responsibility for all
operations of the newspaper, reducing confusion
between the two staffs.
