Pauling Receives Grant
STANFORD, Calif. — Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling has received a
$3 25,255 federal grant to study the possibility that mental illness may be caused
by a lack of certain essential nutrients.
The Stanford University chemist said: "The large number of people confined to
mental hospitals and the even larger number whose lives are to varying degrees less
valuable to them because of mental illness makes the significance of this work
obvious."
In The Capitol
WASHINGTON — An effort to abolish the draft and the entire Selective Service
System as the manpower supplier for the Indochina war was rejected by the
House yesterday 73-11.
Divided House Democrats also adopted a compromise end-the-war resolution
yesterday that aims at withdrawal of U.S. troops from Indochina by the end of
1972.
No Parole For Jimmy
WASHINGTON — The U.S. Parole Board Wednesday denied parole to Teamster
President James R. Hoffa, apparently ending his chances for re-election as chief of
the world's largest union.
The board continued Hoffa's case to June of 1972, long after the union
election next July.
Davis Trial To Proceed
SAN FRANCISCO — San Quentin convict Ruchell Magee lost a federal court bid
yesterday to halt temporarily murder-kidnap proceedings against himself and
black militant Angela Davis in suburban San Rafael.
U.S. District Judge Samuel Conti said Magee's petition to halt the case pending
completion of federal court action on another petition was "legally frivolous" - as
were eight other motions Magee filed.
