NSF Grant
The National Science Foundation
has awarded Stanford University a
$375,000 grant to design and construct
a hospital prototype of a "pion
channel"-a device for capturing
subatomic particles for use in cancer
treatment.
The prototype will be built at
Stanford's High Energy Physics
Laboratory and preliminary tests of the
system will be undertaken there. If
initial tests prove that it is feasible, the
pion facility will be installed in the
Stanford University Hospital, for a
construction cost of approximately $5
million, for the treatment of 1000
patients a year.
The project is under the direction of
Dr. Schettman and Dr. Henry S.
Kaplan, professor and chairman of the
Department of Radiology at the School
of Medicine.
"Fifty such facilities across the
country could have a major impact in
the treatment of cancer, and over a
period of 10 years the construction
cost of these per patient would be
small," the researchers said.
Art Lecture
One of America's most noted art
historians, Prof. Julius S. Held of

Barnard College, will deliver the annual
Leon Sloss Jr. Memorial Lectures at
Stanford, April 4-5-6.
Dr. Held, an authority on Dutch and
Flemish paintings, will speak on various
aspects of the life of Rembrandt.
The first speech is at 3 p.m. Sunday
and the remaining two at 8 p.m., all in
the Cummings Art Auditorium. The
speeches are free and open to the
public.
Ball Speaks
George Ball, former Under Secretary
of State in the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations, will lecture on "The
Devil's Advocate 1971" at 8 p.m. this
evening in the Art Auditorium at
Stanford.
Since earning a doctor of law degree
in 1933 from Northwestern, Ball has
held many government positions, and
has spent many years in private
practice.
With the advent of the Kennedy
Administration, he became Under
Secretary of State for Economic
Affairs, a position he held for nearly
five years, before resigning. Later, at
the request of President Johnson, he
served as U.S. Ambassador to the UN
for a year.
Ball is presently a senior partner of
the international investment banking

firm of Lehman Brothers. He is also
honorary chairman of Lehman Brothers
International, Ltd., and counsel to the
law firm of Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen and
Hamilton.
Free and open to the public, his talk
will be sponsored by the Committee on
International Studies.
Name Change
The Housing Office has announced
that all of the Stern Houses will have
new names beginning this quarter. This
change is due to a clause in the will of
Lucie Stern that has only recently
come to light due to the diligent
research of two of Stanford's law
students, Gretchen McHenry and Steve
Wong.
The changes will be as follows:
N. Twain - Dasher House
E. Twain - Dancer House

Burbank - Prancer House
Muir - Vixen House
Serra - Comet House
Donner - Cupid House
Lassen - Donder House
Larkin - Blitzen House
In their announcement, the Housing
Office added, "We hope that the
changes will not be too inconvenient
although mix-ups during the first few
weeks are expected."
