# Jury Sentences Calley To Life At Hard Labor
## 
### ED KOHN 
First Lt. William L. Calley Jr., 27,
was sentenced yesterday to life
imprisonment at hard labor for the
murder of at least 22 men, women and
children during the My Lai massacre
three years ago.
The six-man military jury deliberated
for six hours before returning the
sentence. The Ft. Benning jury, which
Monday found Calley guilty of
premeditated murder, had two
sentencing options: life imprisonment
at hard labor or death by hanging.
*
The White House reported President
Nixon is receiving more than 10,000
telegrams a day as nationwide reaction *
to the Calley verdict and sentence
mounted. The White House said the
telegrams are running more than 100 to
one against the conviction and most
urge executive clemency.
However, presidential press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said clemency
"would not be a procedure that would
be taken at this time." Calley may
appeal the conviction and sentence as
high as the President and the Supreme
Court.
Congress Flooded
Many Senators and Representatives
also reported that they were being
flooded with mail and telegrams.
Several local draft boards, particularly
those in the South, reported receiving a
deluge of messages from irate parents
of potential servicemen.
Calley's attorney, George Latimore,
called the jury's penalty "the lesser of
two evils."
Calley also was ordered dismissed
from the Army, where he had earned
awards for gallantry in Vietnam and a
Purple Heart for combat wounds. His
monthly pay of $773.1 0 was ordered
forfeited.
Calley is eligible for parole after he
has served 1 0 years of his sentence. An
appeal of the sentence is automatic and
may take between one to five years.
latimore, looking calm after the

sentence had been read said "I'm
confident the sentence will be abated."
Sen. B. Everett Jordan (D-N.C.), said he
was "willing to do everything" to
expedite Calley's appeal.
Lesser of Two Evils
"You'll find no case in military
justice that has torn America apart like
this case has torn America apart,"
Latimore said. "I had the choice of two
evils. I got the lesser of two evils. I'd
say Calley feels the same way."
After the sentencing, Calley was
returned to the Ft. Benning stockade,
where he has been held since his
conviction Monday.
• As he left the courthouse
accompanied by military policemen,
Calley was met by an increasingly-noisy
crowd of 150 supporters. One woman
in a red pants-suit shouted: "They
crucified him."
Calley is the first American to be
convicted in the aftermath of My Lai,
where a platoon of American
infantrymen turned on unresisting
Vietnamese civilians after failing to
flush out a crack Viet Cong unit. Calley
was commanding the First Platoon of
Charlie Company, which was
spearheading the action during the
March 1 6, 1968 action.

As he had done two days earlier with
the verdict in the case, jury foreman
Col. Clifford Ford, 53, the only jury
member who has not seen duty in
Vietnam, rose to read the sentence to
Calley:
"First Lieutenant William L. Calley,
it is my duty as president of this court
to inform you that the court, in closed
session and upon secret written ballot,
three fourth of the members present at
the time the vote was taken concurring,
sentences you:
—"To be confined at hard labor for
the length of your natural life;
—"To be dismissed from the service;
—"To forfeit all pay and
allowances."
Calley returned a weak salute and his
body sagged momentarily. He then
headed for the door, where the military
policemen were waiting for him.

Lesser of Two Evils
"You'll find no case in military
justice that has torn America apart like
this case has torn America apart,"
Latimore said. "I had the choice of two
evils. I got the lesser of two evils. I'd
say Calley feels the same way."
After the sentencing, Calley was
returned to the Ft. Benning stockade,
where he has been held since his
conviction Monday.
• As he left the courthouse
accompanied by military policemen,
Calley was met by an increasingly-noisy
crowd of 150 supporters. One woman
in a red pants-suit shouted: "They
crucified him."
Calley is the first American to be
convicted in the aftermath of My Lai,
where a platoon of American
infantrymen turned on unresisting
Vietnamese civilians after failing to
flush out a crack Viet Cong unit. Calley
was commanding the First Platoon of
Charlie Company, which was
spearheading the action during the
March 1 6, 1968 action.
Sentence Read
As he had done two days earlier with
the verdict in the case, jury foreman
Col. Clifford Ford, 53, the only jury
member who has not seen duty in
Vietnam, rose to read the sentence to
Calley:
"First Lieutenant William L. Calley,
it is my duty as president of this court
to inform you that the court, in closed
session and upon secret written ballot,
three fourth of the members present at
the time the vote was taken concurring,
sentences you:
—"To be confined at hard labor for
the length of your natural life;
—"To be dismissed from the service;
—"To forfeit all pay and
allowances."
Calley returned a weak salute and his
body sagged momentarily. He then
headed for the door, where the military
policemen were waiting for him.
First Lt. William L. Calley Jr., 27,
was sentenced yesterday to life
imprisonment at hard labor for the
murder of at least 22 men, women and
children during the My Lai massacre
three years ago.
The six-man military jury deliberated
for six hours before returning the
sentence. The Ft. Benning jury, which
Monday found Calley guilty of
premeditated murder, had two
sentencing options: life imprisonment
at hard labor or death by hanging.

The White House reported President
Nixon is receiving more than 10,000
telegrams a day as nationwide reaction *
to the Calley verdict and sentence
mounted. The White House said the
telegrams are running more than 100 to
one against the conviction and most
urge executive clemency.
However, presidential press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said clemency
"would not be a procedure that would
be taken at this time." Calley may
appeal the conviction and sentence as
high as the President and the Supreme
Court.
