# Tresidder Boycott
## Picketers Block Union Delivery 
### PHIL LIND CHARLES MERRILL 
Members of United Stanford
Employees (USE), the BSU, the Black
Liberation Front (BLF) — a
revolutionary group in Redwood City
and East Palo Alto - and Vencermeos,
boycotting to regain the jobs of 12
Tresidder employees, attempted to turn
away trucks delivering food to the
Union yesterday. At the same time over
30 Tresidder employees signed a
petition expressing disagreement with
the boycott.
As the picketing began in the
morning, a scuffle broke out when
Tresidder Food Service Director,

Raymond Harrington removed a picket
sign that had been stuck through
louvered windows and according to
bystanders, struck picketer Michael
Holman in the face with it.
At the time of the incident, the
picket line was located at the loading
ramp in back of the Union where
delivery trucks unload goods used by
the Tresidder food service. The
picketers successfully turned away
three trucks during the day while at
least six other trucks completed their
deliveries.
Tresidder Union Director Forrest
Tregea stated that the boycott was not
posing any significant threat to the

continued operation of union facilities.
"Most of the drivers are not sure
what to do, so they call their
supervisors or ask the people for a
union card. All but a couple of the
drivers went on to make their deliveries
after being informed the boycott was
not official," stated Tregea.
Protest To Continue
According to Jim Berk, since the
NLRB has not reached a decision
granting any one union jurisdiction
over Stanford labor affairs, USE can
call a legal, authorized boycott. "We'll
keep on picketing until the 12 workers
are rehired and we have assurance that
layoffs will stop," he said.
Tregea also anticipated a
continuation of the boycott. "It could
go on all spring—lt's good weather!" he
remarked. "But I'm not sure what we
can do. I don't know who we're dealing
with. If I hire someone, I've got to pay
him, I've got to have some money in
the bank to pay him with. I just can't
do it."
The alternative food service
sponsored by the boycotters was in
operation again and "Will continue for
the remainder of the boycott,"
according to John Kamen, who has
been in charge of the concessions.
Picketers commented that the alternate
food service helps the boycott a great
deal.
According to Tregea, "There is no
way to accurately determine the sales
drops yet but as far as I can tell,
business is about normal.
Sales Going Up
However, Kamen stated that the
sales from the alternative service has
been steadily increasing daily. "On
Monday we sold $70 worth of food,
Tuesday it increased to $90 and today

we sold over $120 worth of food."
The money raised is going into a
fund to aid the 12 workers and pay for
the leafletting that is also being done
by USE.
Meanwhile, a petition critical of the
boycott appeared in the kitchen and
began circulating among Tresidder
employees. Tregea stated that about 45
people expressed their dissatisfaction
with the boycott but a number of
employees were reluctant to discuss the
petition.
One full time employee stated that if
it was not for the boycott "we would
have.a terrible load. The boycott is
making our jobs as difficult as they
should be. Without the boycott we
would really need the 12 that were laid
off."
One part time employee stated that
"People are afraid for their jobs, so
they would naturally sign the petition
to avoid further intimidation. What
these people really want is a union in
order to be protected."
According to Berk, "Some of the
people patronizing Tresidder say that
by boycotting, we are going to get
more workers laid off. However, the
history of labor organizing shows that
the only power workers have is to
apply as much pressure upon the
employer as possible so he is forced to
succumb to demands. This is also why
we are preparing to approach the
Teamsters with the boycott
authorization."
Tregea maintained that some of the
workers fear that the boycott will cut
Tresidder revenues to the point where
more employees would have to be laid
off. "But we intend to continue
operating with the employees we
have," he stated.

Holman in the face with it.
At the time of the incident, the
picket line was located at the loading
ramp in back of the Union where
delivery trucks unload goods used by
the Tresidder food service. The
picketers successfully turned away
three trucks during the day while at
least six other trucks completed their
deliveries.
Tresidder Union Director Forrest
Tregea stated that the boycott was not
posing any significant threat to the

continued operation of union facilities.
"Most of the drivers are not sure
what to do, so they call their
supervisors or ask the people for a
union card. All but a couple of the
drivers went on to make their deliveries
after being informed the boycott was
not official," stated Tregea.
Protest To Continue
According to Jim Berk, since the
NLRB has not reached a decision
granting any one union jurisdiction
over Stanford labor affairs, USE can
call a legal, authorized boycott. "We'll
keep on picketing until the 12 workers
are rehired and we have assurance that
layoffs will stop," he said.
Tregea also anticipated a
continuation of the boycott. "It could
go on all spring—lt's good weather!" he
remarked. "But I'm not sure what we
can do. I don't know who we're dealing
with. If I hire someone, I've got to pay
him, I've got to have some money in
the bank to pay him with. I just can't
do it."
The alternative food service
sponsored by the boycotters was in
operation again and "Will continue for
the remainder of the boycott,"
according to John Kamen, who has
been in charge of the concessions.
Picketers commented that the alternate
food service helps the boycott a great
deal.
According to Tregea, "There is no
way to accurately determine the sales
drops yet but as far as I can tell,
business is about normal.
Sales Going Up
However, Kamen stated that the
sales from the alternative service has
been steadily increasing daily. "On
Monday we sold $70 worth of food,
Tuesday it increased to $90 and today

we sold over $120 worth of food."
The money raised is going into a
fund to aid the 12 workers and pay for
the leafletting that is also being done
by USE.
Meanwhile, a petition critical of the
boycott appeared in the kitchen and
began circulating among Tresidder
employees. Tregea stated that about 45
people expressed their dissatisfaction
with the boycott but a number of
employees were reluctant to discuss the
petition.
One full time employee stated that if
it was not for the boycott "we would
have.a terrible load. The boycott is
making our jobs as difficult as they
should be. Without the boycott we
would really need the 12 that were laid
off."
One part time employee stated that
"People are afraid for their jobs, so
they would naturally sign the petition
to avoid further intimidation. What
these people really want is a union in
order to be protected."
According to Berk, "Some of the
people patronizing Tresidder say that
by boycotting, we are going to get
more workers laid off. However, the
history of labor organizing shows that
the only power workers have is to
apply as much pressure upon the
employer as possible so he is forced to
succumb to demands. This is also why
we are preparing to approach the
Teamsters with the boycott
authorization."
Tregea maintained that some of the
workers fear that the boycott will cut
Tresidder revenues to the point where
more employees would have to be laid
off. "But we intend to continue
operating with the employees we
have," he stated.

Members of United Stanford
Employees (USE), the BSU, the Black

boycotting to regain the jobs of 12
Tresidder employees, attempted to turn
away trucks delivering food to the
Union yesterday. At the same time over
30 Tresidder employees signed a
petition expressing disagreement with
the boycott.

louvered windows and according to
