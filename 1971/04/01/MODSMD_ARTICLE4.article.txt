# Laser Scientists Discuss Support

### STEVEN G. UNGAR RICHARD B. MILES 
(This is Part Three of a three-part series describing
laser research at Stanford In this installment we
explore the reactions of the researchers regarding
Department of Defense funding.)
The laser has often been described as a solution in
search of a problem. But now it appears that, after a
decade of research and development, the "problems"
are beginning to appear, and reports of laser-guided
bombs knocking out. tanks in Laos are making some
people, especially at Stanford, a bit nervous.
Stanford has one of the largest, most productive,
and most heavily funded university laser research
programs in the United States. Over $600,000 in
federal grants and contracts help to support seven
principal investigators, almost 20 graduate students,
and innumerable secretaries and technicians.
Although many federal agencies are now interested in
funding laser research, the principal source of support
in the past has been the Department of Defense.
Since the Mansfield Amendment stipulates (or
seems to stipulate) that any DoD funded project at an
educational institution must have a military
application, it would appear that there is a lot of
military research in progress at Stanford at this
moment.
When confronted with the allegation that their
work is war-related, laser researchers are universal in
denying any direct connection (other than financial)
with the military. Research Associate .lames F. Young
of the Hanson Microwave Laboratory put. it this way:
"I think it would be an untrue allegation in the way
it's popularly meant. I think there are some much
subtler influences because of support by DoD.
Nobody likes DoD support any less than we do. We
tried hard all last summer to get other sources of
funds. . . The pmblem is, when the military supports
everything, they're the people who come around with
the problems, and so you think about those
problems.
"I don't think what we're doing has any pressing

value to the military. I think its value to the military
is in the long term technical capability of the country
or the research community as a whole, and the
gamble, the hope, perhaps, on the part of the
military, that something will pop up out of this
research. This has happened enough times that the
military thinks it's sort of the old million monkeys
and a million typewriters routine: they just want to
make sure there's enough typewriters around. Maybe,
once in a while, something will pop up, and when it
does they'll whisk it away to a good system
development group where they can put it into
operation—which is never in a university."
Although DoD provides the lion's share of research
funds, the National Science Foundation provides
more than a third of the total money spent each year.
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow of the Physics
Department gets 16 percent of his funding from the
Army, the rest from the NSF. Professor Schawlow
was one of the inventors of the laser, and from the
beginning he has resisted efforts on the part of the
government to classify either his work, or himself (he
has refused to apply for a security clearance, on the
grounds that since basic knowledge can't be kept a
secret, if he doesn't have a clearance he can't be
cajoled into working on applications).
Professor Schawlow also scoffs at the idea of
Stanford being actively engaged in war research. "The
absence of secrecy is a tremendous protection for
us," he says. "Anything that the government thinks is
of immediate importance has just got to be secret,
because they don't want the same advantage to go to
possible enemies. And I also believe that it is just not
in the nature of things that scientists, or any other
thinkers, can realize the ultimate consequences of
their thoughts, so to believe that they can control the
future of the science by stopping the science is really
a delusion.
"There's always been some kind of conflict
between artists and their patrons, and I think that we
scientists are very much the same kind of position, as
let's sav, a composer was or a painter a few hundred

years ago. You devote some effort to pleasing your
patron, and you put more effort into pleasing
yourself. And if you can do both, and you can very
often, then you're a successful artist.
"When we were working on the idea of an optical
maser I had never heard of the detached retina. If I'd
been trying to help people with that condition I
certainly wouldn't have been fooling around with
stimulated'emission of light."
The open laboratory approach is also emphasized
by Professor Anthony E. Siegman of the Department
of Electrical Engineering. "We regularly have Soviet
vis'tors here as colleagues in the lab," he says. "These
men have absolute freedom of the lab, and there are
no locked doors and nothing that people stop talking
about when they come around, nothing that they
can't see. They can take absolute, complete detailed
examination of anything they want. So, if there is
anything that somehow has any military value, it's
equally and absolutely wide open to them."
Professor Stephen E. Harris of the Department of
Electrical Engineering echoes this sentiment:
"Anything we do at Stanford is available in Moscow
through the mechanism of Applied Physics Letters on
a three month time scale. So, clearly, the things we
do could not be of urgent military significance in any
sense, or we'd be absolutely crazy to allow a direct
transfer to Moscow on this rather instantaneous time
scale."
However, military significance is often a
delayed-action phenomenon. Harris is careful to
distinguish between immediate and long-range
benefits: "If you ask me are we making advances that
could find their way into a military system on some
time scale, of course, the answer is yes, we are.
Anything that's worth while that's done is going to
find its way into both military and civilian things. I
just think you'd be terribly hard pressed to find
things which are civilian and not military, including
even medical applications. Are they military or are
they civilian?"

us," he says. "Anything that the government thinks is
of immediate importance has just got to be secret,
because they don't want the same advantage to go to
possible enemies. And I also believe that it is just not
in the nature of things that scientists, or any other
thinkers, can realize the ultimate consequences of
their thoughts, so to believe that they can control the
future of the science by stopping the science is really
a delusion.
"There's always been some kind of conflict
between artists and their patrons, and I think that we
scientists are very much the same kind of position, as
let's sav, a composer was or a painter a few hundred

years ago. You devote some effort to pleasing your
patron, and you put more effort into pleasing
yourself. And if you can do both, and you can very
often, then you're a successful artist.
"When we were working on the idea of an optical
maser I had never heard of the detached retina. If I'd
been trying to help people with that condition I
certainly wouldn't have been fooling around with
stimulated'emission of light."
The open laboratory approach is also emphasized
by Professor Anthony E. Siegman of the Department
of Electrical Engineering. "We regularly have Soviet
vis'tors here as colleagues in the lab," he says. "These
men have absolute freedom of the lab, and there are
no locked doors and nothing that people stop talking
about when they come around, nothing that they
can't see. They can take absolute, complete detailed
examination of anything they want. So, if there is
anything that somehow has any military value, it's
equally and absolutely wide open to them."
Professor Stephen E. Harris of the Department of
Electrical Engineering echoes this sentiment:
"Anything we do at Stanford is available in Moscow
through the mechanism of Applied Physics Letters on
a three month time scale. So, clearly, the things we
do could not be of urgent military significance in any
sense, or we'd be absolutely crazy to allow a direct
transfer to Moscow on this rather instantaneous time
scale."
However, military significance is often a
delayed-action phenomenon. Harris is careful to
distinguish between immediate and long-range
benefits: "If you ask me are we making advances that
could find their way into a military system on some
time scale, of course, the answer is yes, we are.
Anything that's worth while that's done is going to
find its way into both military and civilian things. I
just think you'd be terribly hard pressed to find
things which are civilian and not military, including
even medical applications. Are they military or are
they civilian?"
(This is Part Three of a three-part series describing
laser research at Stanford In this installment we
explore the reactions of the researchers regarding
Department of Defense funding.)
The laser has often been described as a solution in
search of a problem. But now it appears that, after a
decade of research and development, the "problems"
are beginning to appear, and reports of laser-guided
bombs knocking out. tanks in Laos are making some
people, especially at Stanford, a bit nervous.
Stanford has one of the largest, most productive,
and most heavily funded university laser research
programs in the United States. Over $600,000 in
federal grants and contracts help to support seven
principal investigators, almost 20 graduate students,
and innumerable secretaries and technicians.
Although many federal agencies are now interested in
funding laser research, the principal source of support
in the past has been the Department of Defense.
Since the Mansfield Amendment stipulates (or
seems to stipulate) that any DoD funded project at an
educational institution must have a military
application, it would appear that there is a lot of
military research in progress at Stanford at this
moment.
When confronted with the allegation that their
work is war-related, laser researchers are universal in
denying any direct connection (other than financial)
with the military. Research Associate .lames F. Young
of the Hanson Microwave Laboratory put. it this way:
"I think it would be an untrue allegation in the way
it's popularly meant. I think there are some much
subtler influences because of support by DoD.
Nobody likes DoD support any less than we do. We
tried hard all last summer to get other sources of
funds. . . The pmblem is, when the military supports
everything, they're the people who come around with
the problems, and so you think about those
problems.
"I don't think what we're doing has any pressing

value to the military. I think its value to the military
is in the long term technical capability of the country
or the research community as a whole, and the
gamble, the hope, perhaps, on the part of the
military, that something will pop up out of this
research. This has happened enough times that the
military thinks it's sort of the old million monkeys
and a million typewriters routine: they just want to
make sure there's enough typewriters around. Maybe,
once in a while, something will pop up, and when it
does they'll whisk it away to a good system
development group where they can put it into
operation—which is never in a university."
Although DoD provides the lion's share of research
funds, the National Science Foundation provides
more than a third of the total money spent each year.
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow of the Physics
Department gets 16 percent of his funding from the
Army, the rest from the NSF. Professor Schawlow
was one of the inventors of the laser, and from the
beginning he has resisted efforts on the part of the
government to classify either his work, or himself (he
has refused to apply for a security clearance, on the
grounds that since basic knowledge can't be kept a
secret, if he doesn't have a clearance he can't be
cajoled into working on applications).
Professor Schawlow also scoffs at the idea of
Stanford being actively engaged in war research. "The
absence of secrecy is a tremendous protection for
us," he says. "Anything that the government thinks is
of immediate importance has just got to be secret,

funding laser research, the principal source of support
in the past has been the Department of Defense.
Since the Mansfield Amendment stipulates (or
seems to stipulate) that any DoD funded project at an
educational institution must have a military
application, it would appear that there is a lot of
military research in progress at Stanford at this
moment.
When confronted with the allegation that their
work is war-related, laser researchers are universal in
denying any direct connection (other than financial)
with the military. Research Associate .lames F. Young
of the Hanson Microwave Laboratory put. it this way:
"I think it would be an untrue allegation in the way
it's popularly meant. I think there are some much
subtler influences because of support by DoD.
Nobody likes DoD support any less than we do. We
tried hard all last summer to get other sources of
funds. . . The pmblem is, when the military supports
everything, they're the people who come around with
the problems, and so you think about those
problems.
"I don't think what we're doing has any pressing

value to the military. I think its value to the military
is in the long term technical capability of the country
or the research community as a whole, and the
gamble, the hope, perhaps, on the part of the
military, that something will pop up out of this
research. This has happened enough times that the
military thinks it's sort of the old million monkeys
and a million typewriters routine: they just want to
make sure there's enough typewriters around. Maybe,
once in a while, something will pop up, and when it
does they'll whisk it away to a good system
development group where they can put it into
operation—which is never in a university."
Although DoD provides the lion's share of research
funds, the National Science Foundation provides
more than a third of the total money spent each year.
Professor Arthur L. Schawlow of the Physics
Department gets 16 percent of his funding from the
Army, the rest from the NSF. Professor Schawlow
was one of the inventors of the laser, and from the
beginning he has resisted efforts on the part of the
government to classify either his work, or himself (he
has refused to apply for a security clearance, on the
grounds that since basic knowledge can't be kept a
secret, if he doesn't have a clearance he can't be
cajoled into working on applications).
Professor Schawlow also scoffs at the idea of
Stanford being actively engaged in war research. "The
absence of secrecy is a tremendous protection for
us," he says. "Anything that the government thinks is
of immediate importance has just got to be secret,
because they don't want the same advantage to go to
possible enemies. And I also believe that it is just not
in the nature of things that scientists, or any other
thinkers, can realize the ultimate consequences of
their thoughts, so to believe that they can control the
future of the science by stopping the science is really
a delusion.
"There's always been some kind of conflict
between artists and their patrons, and I think that we
scientists are very much the same kind of position, as
let's sav, a composer was or a painter a few hundred

years ago. You devote some effort to pleasing your
patron, and you put more effort into pleasing
yourself. And if you can do both, and you can very
often, then you're a successful artist.
"When we were working on the idea of an optical
maser I had never heard of the detached retina. If I'd
been trying to help people with that condition I
certainly wouldn't have been fooling around with
stimulated'emission of light."
The open laboratory approach is also emphasized
by Professor Anthony E. Siegman of the Department
of Electrical Engineering. "We regularly have Soviet
vis'tors here as colleagues in the lab," he says. "These
men have absolute freedom of the lab, and there are
no locked doors and nothing that people stop talking
about when they come around, nothing that they
can't see. They can take absolute, complete detailed
examination of anything they want. So, if there is
anything that somehow has any military value, it's
equally and absolutely wide open to them."
Professor Stephen E. Harris of the Department of
Electrical Engineering echoes this sentiment:
"Anything we do at Stanford is available in Moscow
through the mechanism of Applied Physics Letters on
a three month time scale. So, clearly, the things we
do could not be of urgent military significance in any
sense, or we'd be absolutely crazy to allow a direct
transfer to Moscow on this rather instantaneous time
scale."
However, military significance is often a
delayed-action phenomenon. Harris is careful to
distinguish between immediate and long-range
benefits: "If you ask me are we making advances that
could find their way into a military system on some
time scale, of course, the answer is yes, we are.
Anything that's worth while that's done is going to
find its way into both military and civilian things. I
just think you'd be terribly hard pressed to find
things which are civilian and not military, including
even medical applications. Are they military or are
they civilian?"
(This is Part Three of a three-part series describing
laser research at Stanford In this installment we
explore the reactions of the researchers regarding
Department of Defense funding.)
The laser has often been described as a solution in
search of a problem. But now it appears that, after a
decade of research and development, the "problems"
are beginning to appear, and reports of laser-guided
bombs knocking out. tanks in Laos are making some
people, especially at Stanford, a bit nervous.
Stanford has one of the largest, most productive,
and most heavily funded university laser research
programs in the United States. Over $600,000 in
federal grants and contracts help to support seven
principal investigators, almost 20 graduate students,
and innumerable secretaries and technicians.
Although many federal agencies are now interested in
