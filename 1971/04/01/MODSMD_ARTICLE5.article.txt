## Employee Coalition Fights Tresidder Lay-Offs 
### 
Linda crouse, bob griffin

"O Cod, we give thee thanks
for Stanford University, for all
who have served it with faithful
labor. . . Let us pray for those
who serve the innumerable daily
needs of the community of
learning." This prayer was canted
by President Lyman and other
administrators at the recent
Founders Day Ceremony in
Memorial Church.
The workers that were laid-off
at 'JYesidder last month take great
comfort in the fact that the
administration is praying for
them. They can't find jobs, they
can't collect unemployment, they
have little food, they can't pay
their rent, they can't clothe their
children; but that's o.k. because
they have the prayers and
sympathy of Richard Lyman and
his $7 5,000 salary.
Of the 12 workers laid off at
Tresidder, only three have found
other employment. The

unemployment problem will be
(•(impounded as campus-wide
lay-offs of low paid workers
continue. Several workers have
already been let go at
Photo-Repro. 16-20 more are
promised at the Physical Plant and
75-100 have been or are about to
be laid-off at other scattered
campus locations.
Stanford, like other
institutions, is in a financial bind
because of the war. To solve their
crisis, they are taking what they
think is the simplest sol ution.
They get rid of workers who are
being paid near poverty-level
wages. They remove those who
can least afford it; i.e., they
further oppress the most
oppressed class in the Stanford
community.
The workers at Tresidder had
nothing to do with the fiscal crisis
now facing the university. It was
the administrators of Stanford

who saw nothing wrong with
making the University a center for
war research. It is the Board of
Trustees who profited the most
from the war. Now the U.S. folly
in Indochina has backfired and
the people who had nothing to do
with it are expected to pay for it.
While workers lose their means
of subsistance, the faculty, many
of whom were silent about or who
actively supported war research,
receive an average $1 000 raise to
go with their $21,000 salaries. At
the same service in Mem Chu
where the administrators prayed
for the workers, they also
intoned, "Let us pray for the men
and women who teach ..."
The big difference is that they
did more than pray for the
faculty- they attempted to buy
their support for the inevitable
repression of students and
workers movements. Witness and
faculty stand on the injunction.
Whether or not they will
ultimately succeed remains to be
seen. The $20-60,000 salaried
administrators have shown us
concretely where their
self-interest and priorities lie.
This attitude of the
administrators forced us into
action when we first received
void of the Tresidder lay-offs. A
coalition of workers' groups
immediately joined together and
began to boycott Tresidder. This
was the only way we thought that

we could fight back in an effective
manner.
With the help of sympathetic
students, we were able to cut
business at the Tresidder cafeteria
by as much as 50 percent. We
offered an alternative food service
and supplied sandwiches and fruit
enough to feed over 200 people.
The money received from these
food sales Is going directly into a
fund to aid the laid-off workers
(Stanford won't pay
unemployment insurance until it
is forced to in December 1971).
Naturally, when we started the
boycott, University officials and
the Tresidder administration
panicked. At first they tried to
tell us that the boycott would
force them to layoff more
workers from lack of business.
This was in no way a response to
our demand that the laid-off
workers be relocated. In fact,
workers at 'IVesidder urged us to
continue the boycott.
One of our original demands
was to "Relocate Tresidder
workers." We made this demand
through ignorance because we
didn't thoroughly investigate the
situation. In the past two weeks
we have checked out the working
conditions in the Tresidder
kitchen. Where four persons were
once required to operate a giant
dishwashing machine, there is now
only one very overworked man.
Everyone has had to double or

triple their normal work load. The
situation in the kitchen is
deplorable. Relocation of the
laid-off workers will not solve this
problem. We now demand that
they be rehired.
The "great concern" stated by
Tresidder officials has failed to
materialize. Only three of the
workers have found other jobs.
Apparently the administration
thought we would give up the
struggle and go away. Well, we
haven't given up, nor will we until
our demands are met. We are back
at Tresidder as promised, "with a
vengeance." If necessary, we will
shut down Tresidder with our
boycott, injunction
notwithstanding.
Help us win our struggle. Join
the picket line. Boycott
Tresidder!

"O Cod, we give thee thanks
for Stanford University, for all
who have served it with faithful
labor. . . Let us pray for those
who serve the innumerable daily
needs of the community of
learning." This prayer was canted
by President Lyman and other
administrators at the recent
Founders Day Ceremony in
Memorial Church.
The workers that were laid-off
at 'JYesidder last month take great
comfort in the fact that the
administration is praying for
them. They can't find jobs, they
can't collect unemployment, they
have little food, they can't pay
their rent, they can't clothe their
children; but that's o.k. because
they have the prayers and
sympathy of Richard Lyman and
his $7 5,000 salary.
Of the 12 workers laid off at
Tresidder, only three have found
other employment. The

unemployment problem will be
(•(impounded as campus-wide
lay-offs of low paid workers
continue. Several workers have
already been let go at
Photo-Repro. 16-20 more are
promised at the Physical Plant and
75-100 have been or are about to
be laid-off at other scattered
campus locations.
Stanford, like other
institutions, is in a financial bind
because of the war. To solve their
crisis, they are taking what they
think is the simplest sol ution.
They get rid of workers who are
being paid near poverty-level
wages. They remove those who
can least afford it; i.e., they
further oppress the most
oppressed class in the Stanford
community.
The workers at Tresidder had
nothing to do with the fiscal crisis
now facing the university. It was
the administrators of Stanford

who saw nothing wrong with
making the University a center for
war research. It is the Board of
Trustees who profited the most
from the war. Now the U.S. folly
in Indochina has backfired and
the people who had nothing to do
with it are expected to pay for it.
While workers lose their means
of subsistance, the faculty, many
of whom were silent about or who
actively supported war research,
receive an average $1 000 raise to
go with their $21,000 salaries. At
the same service in Mem Chu
where the administrators prayed
for the workers, they also
intoned, "Let us pray for the men
and women who teach ..."
The big difference is that they
did more than pray for the
faculty- they attempted to buy
their support for the inevitable
repression of students and
workers movements. Witness and
faculty stand on the injunction.
Whether or not they will
ultimately succeed remains to be
seen. The $20-60,000 salaried
administrators have shown us
concretely where their
self-interest and priorities lie.
This attitude of the
administrators forced us into
action when we first received
void of the Tresidder lay-offs. A
coalition of workers' groups
immediately joined together and
began to boycott Tresidder. This
was the only way we thought that

we could fight back in an effective
manner.
With the help of sympathetic
students, we were able to cut
business at the Tresidder cafeteria
by as much as 50 percent. We
offered an alternative food service
and supplied sandwiches and fruit
enough to feed over 200 people.
The money received from these
food sales Is going directly into a
fund to aid the laid-off workers
(Stanford won't pay
unemployment insurance until it
is forced to in December 1971).
Naturally, when we started the
boycott, University officials and
the Tresidder administration
panicked. At first they tried to
tell us that the boycott would
force them to layoff more
workers from lack of business.
This was in no way a response to
our demand that the laid-off
workers be relocated. In fact,
workers at 'IVesidder urged us to
continue the boycott.
One of our original demands
was to "Relocate Tresidder
workers." We made this demand
through ignorance because we
didn't thoroughly investigate the
situation. In the past two weeks
we have checked out the working
conditions in the Tresidder
kitchen. Where four persons were
once required to operate a giant
dishwashing machine, there is now
only one very overworked man.
Everyone has had to double or

triple their normal work load. The
situation in the kitchen is
deplorable. Relocation of the
laid-off workers will not solve this
problem. We now demand that
they be rehired.
The "great concern" stated by
Tresidder officials has failed to
materialize. Only three of the
workers have found other jobs.
Apparently the administration
thought we would give up the
struggle and go away. Well, we
haven't given up, nor will we until
our demands are met. We are back
at Tresidder as promised, "with a
vengeance." If necessary, we will
shut down Tresidder with our
boycott, injunction
notwithstanding.
Help us win our struggle. Join
the picket line. Boycott
Tresidder!

"O Cod, we give thee thanks
for Stanford University, for all
who have served it with faithful
labor. . . Let us pray for those
who serve the innumerable daily
needs of the community of
learning." This prayer was canted
by President Lyman and other
administrators at the recent
Founders Day Ceremony in
Memorial Church.
The workers that were laid-off
at 'JYesidder last month take great
comfort in the fact that the
administration is praying for
them. They can't find jobs, they
can't collect unemployment, they
have little food, they can't pay
their rent, they can't clothe their
children; but that's o.k. because
they have the prayers and
sympathy of Richard Lyman and
his $7 5,000 salary.
Of the 12 workers laid off at
Tresidder, only three have found
other employment. The

unemployment problem will be
(•(impounded as campus-wide
lay-offs of low paid workers
continue. Several workers have
already been let go at
Photo-Repro. 16-20 more are
promised at the Physical Plant and
75-100 have been or are about to
be laid-off at other scattered
campus locations.
Stanford, like other
institutions, is in a financial bind
because of the war. To solve their
crisis, they are taking what they
think is the simplest sol ution.
They get rid of workers who are
being paid near poverty-level
wages. They remove those who
can least afford it; i.e., they
further oppress the most
oppressed class in the Stanford
community.
The workers at Tresidder had
nothing to do with the fiscal crisis
now facing the university. It was
the administrators of Stanford

who saw nothing wrong with
making the University a center for
war research. It is the Board of
Trustees who profited the most
from the war. Now the U.S. folly
in Indochina has backfired and
the people who had nothing to do
with it are expected to pay for it.
While workers lose their means
of subsistance, the faculty, many
of whom were silent about or who
actively supported war research,
receive an average $1 000 raise to
go with their $21,000 salaries. At
the same service in Mem Chu
where the administrators prayed
for the workers, they also
intoned, "Let us pray for the men
and women who teach ..."
The big difference is that they
did more than pray for the
faculty- they attempted to buy
their support for the inevitable
repression of students and
workers movements. Witness and
faculty stand on the injunction.
Whether or not they will
ultimately succeed remains to be
seen. The $20-60,000 salaried
administrators have shown us
concretely where their
self-interest and priorities lie.
This attitude of the
administrators forced us into
action when we first received
void of the Tresidder lay-offs. A
coalition of workers' groups
immediately joined together and
began to boycott Tresidder. This
was the only way we thought that

we could fight back in an effective
manner.
With the help of sympathetic
students, we were able to cut
business at the Tresidder cafeteria
by as much as 50 percent. We
offered an alternative food service
and supplied sandwiches and fruit
enough to feed over 200 people.
The money received from these
food sales Is going directly into a
fund to aid the laid-off workers
(Stanford won't pay
unemployment insurance until it
is forced to in December 1971).
Naturally, when we started the
boycott, University officials and
the Tresidder administration
panicked. At first they tried to
tell us that the boycott would
force them to layoff more
workers from lack of business.
This was in no way a response to
our demand that the laid-off
workers be relocated. In fact,
workers at 'IVesidder urged us to
continue the boycott.
One of our original demands
was to "Relocate Tresidder
workers." We made this demand
through ignorance because we
didn't thoroughly investigate the
situation. In the past two weeks
we have checked out the working
conditions in the Tresidder
kitchen. Where four persons were
once required to operate a giant
dishwashing machine, there is now
only one very overworked man.
Everyone has had to double or

triple their normal work load. The
situation in the kitchen is
deplorable. Relocation of the
laid-off workers will not solve this
problem. We now demand that
they be rehired.
The "great concern" stated by
Tresidder officials has failed to
materialize. Only three of the
workers have found other jobs.
Apparently the administration
thought we would give up the
struggle and go away. Well, we
haven't given up, nor will we until
our demands are met. We are back
at Tresidder as promised, "with a
vengeance." If necessary, we will
shut down Tresidder with our
boycott, injunction
notwithstanding.
Help us win our struggle. Join
the picket line. Boycott
Tresidder!
