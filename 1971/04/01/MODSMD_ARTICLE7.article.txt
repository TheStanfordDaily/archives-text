The case of John Keilch, the
library worker suspended 45 days
for participating in the Lodge
protest, reveals a control of the
news which is common at
Stanford. It is shameful that, with
the exception of KZSU and
Employees Organize, all media
have merely repeated the
University News Service press
release without taking a brief hour
to read the documents in the case
or interview the people involved.
Section 403 of the Cal. Penal
Code provides: "Every person
who, without authority of law,
willfully disturbs or breaks up any

assembly or meeting ... is guilty
of a misdemeanor." This is
punishable by up to six months in
jail or up to $500 in fine.
The constitutionality of this
section was tested in the recent
Coachella-Tunney case (In re Kay,
1C.3d930;83 Ca1.Rptr.686,464
.Rptr.686,464 P.2dl 42).
"Under most circumstances, of
course, ordinary good taste and
decorum would dictate that a
person addressing a meeting not
be interrupted or otherwise
disturbed . . . Audience activities,
such as heckling, interrupting,
harsh questioning, and booing,

even though they may be impolite
and discourteous, can nonetheless
advance the goals of the First
Amendment."
One conclusion the court
reached was that " .. it must be
shown that the defendant
substantially impaired the
conduct of the meeting by
intentionally committing acts in
violation of implicit customs or
usages . . of which he knew . . "
In the Lodge protest, Lodge
intended to speak above the
protest but deferred to Mr.
Campbell's decision to cancel the
speech - that's on the tape
recording of the meeting. A
speaker or convenor cannot
convert a mere disturbance into a
criminal disruption by deciding to
cancel the meeting.
John Keilch's grievance was
that he had been treated unfairly
in several ways. Provost Miller
chose to ignore almost all these
grievances. He was interested in
whether the 'disruption' policy
applied to employees in
non-job-related activities and
whether John had violated the
'disruption' policy. These two
issues were not resolved in the
grievance hearings. Provost Miller
decided them.
Stanford always has been a
'company town' but as the
pressures for change build up,
then the use of fear to rule will
increase. We people who work
here will resist. Who do you think
will win?
