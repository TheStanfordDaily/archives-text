## Franklin Singled Out 
###

I was surprised to read, in a
recent issue of Time, that H.
Bruce Franklin led a group of
thirty hecklers in shouting down
Henry Cabot Lodge. I was present
when a large number of students
and non-students shouted down
Mr. Lodge, but the only time I
noticed Professor Franklin was
when Berkeley Tomkins, the
"moderator," singled him out of
the crowd.
The participation of Professor
Franklin has been transfigured, in
the minds of his enemies, into
leadership. While there is no
doubt that Bruct is a leader of the
best-organized group on the ueft
in the area, Venceremos, there is
little reason to believe that Bruce
was a prime mover of the Lodge
demonstration. In fact, he had
little to do with the planning. His
actions that day were no different
than those of perhaps a hundred
or more others. Yet large numbers
of people continue to ascribe the
events of that day to Bruce's
leadership. In fact, they believe
that by cleansing the campus of a
few leaders that the campus
radical movement will be
eliminated.
Bad Apple Theory
This "bad apple" theory of
revolution is nothing new. Mayor
Yorty explained the Watts
insurrection in the same way.
Students, we are told, need the
leadership of "evil" professors to
take action. People who are used
to operating in hierarchies cannot
understand a movement which is
not based on a hierarchical
structure.
I do not believe that Richard
W. Lyman, the "Wicked Dick of
the West" subscribes to the
bad-apple theory. Lyman's
strategy has gone beyond
attacking leadership. Familiar
with splits and differences within

the movement on campus, he has
sought to isolate Venceremos. Not
only is Venceremos specifically
named on the injunction, but the
University thinks that all the
individuals named are in
Venceremos. Other radical
leaders, and many others engaged
in similar actions (or non-acts)
were not named defendants.
Venceremos
It is ti'ue that Venceremos has
been isolated from many people
who consider themselves part of
the anti-war movement on
campus. Many people disagree on
tactics, strategy, or basic
principles (or for persona!
reasons). Others resent the
commitment and impatience of
Venceremos members. The
success of the exile provision of
the injunction, however, should
end all possibility of isolation.
If enforceable, this provision
would set a dangerous precedent.
It is not just aimed at those
currently involved. Any time the
University feels threatened, it will
be able to resort to this tactic.
Anyone who participates in an
effective action may be suspended
and banned from campus.
Many people associate the
injunction with trashing, beating,
and shooting—an association the
University has tried to encourage.
Of course, these activities are
already illegal, so the injunction
has little consequence in these
areas. What is forgotten is the
University's concern about the
peaceful occupation of the
computation center.
Successful Occupation
The computer center was
occupied by a large number of
people, including people from
Venceremos, the New Left
Projects, Columbae House and a
number of unaffiliated people. It
was occupied because SRI was

doing war-gaming on the
University's 360-A. The
occupation was successful, in that
SRI pulled its project off the
computer. No act during the Laos
Crisis threatened the university
administration more. Unless the
injunction is smashed, we can
expect to be suspended and
banned from campus should we
take part in such an action in the
future.
For all of Wicked Dick's
protestations about the war, his
injunction seems designed to
prevent acts which effectively
injure the war effort. I am not
suggesting that Lyman is actually
for the war. He believes that the
protection of the university—as is,
is paramount. The war just isn't
very important.
