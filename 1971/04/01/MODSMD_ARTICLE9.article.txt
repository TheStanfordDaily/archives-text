# Nearly Everybody On Campus Reads The DAILY
## 
### 



Yes, there are a lot of people on campus reading the Daily. Our problem is
finding people to write for it. And sell ads for it, and take pictures for it, and edit
copy for it, and draw graphics for it. . .
So now's your chance. Wander into the Daily office at 4 this Sunday afternoon,
and you'll have launched a career that will take you into the homes and hearts of
thousands of people every day. The Daily office is located on Lomita Drive at
Panama Street, in the Storke Student Publications Building.
You're going to be well-read.
