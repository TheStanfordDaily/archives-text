The telephone-book-size book
with EVERYTHING in it
HOWARD ZINN: "A feasl of perceptions, ideas, feel
ings — conveying more of the thought, the mood of the
movement than anything I have seen in print . . .
luxuriant... it stimulates intellectually and visually, and
has the remarkable quality of being sober and joyful
at the same time."
NOAM CHOMSKY: "A brilliantly evocative account of
the movement, capturing its insights and confusions
and, most important, the hope it offers for the future.
This may prove to be a prehistory of the social forces
that will help shape a decent future."
Already in its 55th thousand.
