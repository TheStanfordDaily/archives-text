# Voters Decide Next Tuesday
## Berkeley Voters Face Major Issues 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
BERKELEY-Next Tuesday's city elections narrow sharply on some of the
most sensitive issues in urban politics —control of police, race, and the delicate
mechanism of civic government —in the midst of this deeply divided, simmering
town.
An enormously controversial plan for "community control" of police proposes
to carve Berkeley into black, student, and white sectors, each with their own
department and review board. The ballot measure represents the first serious
city-wide attempt at police control in the nation.
Opponents charge the measure would amount to "apartheid," destroy any sort
of equality under the law, and dilute police protection. Its proponents, most
numerous among students and blacks, deem the partition necessary as the best
way to handle a police force they view as brutal and unresponsive.
In addition a media-dubbed "radical" slate, pledged to work for the
community control plan, hopes to make a strong showing in the city council
elections with every intention of changing the face of Berkeley's centralized
government into neighborhood units.
Neighborhood Rule
However, supporters of the present "city manager" system, similar to Palo
Alto, claim that breaking up Berkeley along such neighborhood lines will only
lead to a return to corrupt, ward-style politics.
Around these focal points swirl a maze of election battles for mayor and city
council. Among the eight candidates in the mayoralty race, there are three top
contenders: the irascible, conservative veteran of the city council, John De Bonia:.
the popular and well-known mederate mainstay Wilmot Sweeney, who also has
the blessings of the town's white establishment; and the young, black left-liberai
Warren Widener, a protege of Berkeley's outspoken freshman congressman Ron
Dellums.
At the moment the race appears a toss-up between Sweeney and Widener with
De Bonis a distant third.
April Coalition
In the city council race thirty-three candidates are running for four vacancies
on the eight-man council. The leftist "April Coalition" slate is made up of two
black lawyers, a white graduate student, and a white community
worker-housewife.
Moderate candidates are worried over the Coalition's chances. The April slate is
credited with registering 10,000 new voters in the campus area of Berkeley, and
Dellums is also lending his prestige and support to their cause. In a city of
120,000, more than 65,000 are eligible to vote, giving Berkeley one of the highest
registration ratios in the state. A heavy turnout is expected on Tuesday.
In the face of the slate's efforts, moderate candidate Tom Taylor, a 3 6-year old
sociologist, this week asked 13 other moderate candidates to agree to a secret poll
which would pare down their number to four and conserve voting strength,
Taylor's idea met with little enthusiasm.
Despite the confusion over the wide range of candidates, the central issues of
police partition, the radical campaign effort, and the future form of government
dominate the political debate. "Berkeley could very well have the first elected
leftist government in the United States. Tom Hayden and others have been saying
this for years," claims Taylor, son of former Army Chief of Staff Maxwell Taylor.
The community control proposal grew out of ideas first put forward by the
National Committee to Combat Fascism, a white radical group closely aligned
with the Black Panthers. A lengthy position paper was later prepared for the
campaign by the Red Family which includes Hayden and Bob Scheer, who ran for
Senate last year on the Peace and Freedom ticket.
Entitled "To Stop A Police State," the booklet claims that "every effort to
reform the police through official channels has failed." In response Berkeley
mayor Wallace Johnson contends, "In Berkeley we have a quarter million contacts
a year between police and citizens. In only about one per thousand does someone
have a complaint." He added that the department receives twice as many
compliments as protests.
Under the plan each "community" would set their won policy guidelines,
hiring standards, and disciplinary procedures. Police would be required to live in
the same area they patrol. Community control, according to the booklet, "would
ensure that the people directly affected represent themselves and begin to find
solutions to their problems."
A poll released by the Berkeley Gazette last Wednesday showed that 96
percent of the police force would resign if the partition plan is passed. Police

lieutenant Darrell Hickman criticized the plan for its "lack of predicibility and
stability." The tall, 15-year veteran said, "You're left to wonder what the future
will bring." He also pointed out that the proposal makes no provision for an
interim police force should the measure pass.
Community Control
At the moment the community control measure is expected to fail by a 60 to
4 0 margin.
But more important to the candidates than the practical considerations of the
community control plan are the racial overtones of the plan. "The amendment is
based on a separitist philosophy and is very racist," says mayoral candidate
Sweeney, a stocky 4 5-year old black lawyer.
The notion of separitlsm is a particularly bitter pill for Berkeley liberals since
the city was one of the first in the country to integrate its schools.
Power Base
D'Army Bailey, a 28-year old black lawyer and member of the April Coalition,
argues that the districts are needed since "black and campus communities have no
power now. It's important to give them a clearly defined base from which they
can begin to relate to the rest of Berkeley."
The soft-spoken candidate continued, "Integration presupposes equal strength
out of which comes some sort of compromise. We clearly don't have this strength
now."
Berkeley student Bill Escamilla, 21, who was swept up by police during a mass
arrest during the People's Park protests in 1969, took a softer approach. "I know
the plan has faults, and it bothers me. But the issue is whether the police should
continue as they are now." He said quietly but firmly, "They have to be
stopped."
City Hall Professionalism
Another target of the April Coalition and liberal candidate Widener is the city
manager form of civic government. These critics condemn the centralized
professionalism of Berkeley city hall whereby the manager is allowed to run the
day-to-day affairs and answers to the electorate only through the council.
Complains Widener in a position paper, "Our system of council—manager

government has not produced a happy combination of representative democracy
and technical expertise, as was originally intended. Instead, it has produced an
unimaginative, leaderless, city government which is out of touch with its
constituents."
To criticism such as Widener's, Mayor Johnson countered, "They have no idea
of experiences with the corruption that occurs in ward situations, the influence
peddling, the spoils, the tampering with police administration.
