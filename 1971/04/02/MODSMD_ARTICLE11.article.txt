# Applications Drop In Private Schools

There has been a drop this year in the number of applications for
positions in the freshman class at Stanford and at other private
colleges across the country.
Fred Hargadon, the Dean of Admissions, says that there are 600
fewer applicants now than last year, but adds that the total still is over
9,000 for 1,400 places. Hargadon points out that Stanford has a
smaller drop than many Eastern schools. Harvard has had 11 percent
fewer applicants; other Ivy League schools like Brown, Princeton,
Yale and Penn. have had large drops as well. Although Yale and
Princeton may just be undergoing a natural correction process after
their great increase in applications after going co-ed last year, other
private school applications may be down as much as 50 percent.
Public Enrollment Up
Projections from the United States Office of Education show that
1.94 million new students will enter college this fall, an increase of
five percent over 1970.
While applications drop here, many state-supported schools are
seeing large increases in the number of applications. The University of
North Carolina has a 33 percent application increase; other state
schools have similar rises despite declines in out-of-state applications
at many schools. This, would tend to support the argument that
financial pressures are keeping students closer to home in less
expensive schools.
The reasons for the drops at Stanford are not completely clear at
fie moment. "Our problem," says Hargadon, "is we don't know how
to get a fix on the problem." After acceptances are mailed out on
April 15, he said, he will be in a better position to look at the data
and see what trends have developed. "I think," he added, "this whole
thing points out that we don't really know why students apply to the
schools they do."
According to Hargadon there may be fewer multiple applications
because of increased application fees at other schools. Stanford has
not changed its fee this year, but it has moved its application deadline
up from Feb. 1 to Jan. 1. Achievement tests were required for the
first time this year. These changes may have reduced the number of
applicants.
Another reason may be the new draft system that lets students
know more accurately just what their chances of being drafted are.
Hargadon points also to the increasing costs, tuition, and other
expenses of higher education.
Effect of Disruptions
He also said that certain disruptive activities on campus may have
affected the number of applications. Columbia suffered a large drop in
applications after the strike in 1968, while Kent State's applications
are expected to drop 46 percent this year.
"It's also struck us that there may be a retreat from urban and
suburban campuses. We're in a kind of urban area; we have crime."
Hargadon also said that "They may be listening to what we tell
them, that college education is not the end-all, the be-all when you're
18 or 19." Hargadon believes some people are better off in fields that
don't require a degree.
"A college education is not for everybody," he continued, noting
that only those students with both ability and desire for academic
work should attend college. "There is the problem that in many fields
you need a degree.
"We may be going through a real watershed in admissions!" He
cited increasing costs, "greater amounts of time given non-academic
matters, and a self-concern that's almost become a malaise." People
are saying to themselves, "It's not relevant, I'm bored.
"This may represent a period of substantial non-intellectualism.
That's not anti-intellectualism, but a genuine kind of malaise about
the learning process."
According to the New York Times, private colleges caught in
worsening financial binds may start competing for those students who
can pay their own way without financial aid. Hargadon said this
would not be a factor at Stanford. "We make our decision," he said,
"without knowing the financial situation." After the decisions are
made, he said, the financial aid is worked out.
Hargadon said he will start to study the application drop after all
the acceptances are sent in April. "It is very possible that this is
nothing more than a self-correcting process in the system adjusting
back. My argument would be that I can think of a lot of explanations.
I tend to be very cautious in the interpretation of what may be very
complex events," Hargadon concluded.
