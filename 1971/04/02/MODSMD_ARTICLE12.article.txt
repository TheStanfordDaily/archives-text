# China Week Set
## 
### 
In response to the growing
interest in Chinese internal
events and foreign policy,
several campus groups are
sponsoring a week of films,
panel discussions, speeches,
and slides on contemporary
China. A big-character board
like those in China during the
Cultural Revolution will be on

the wall of the Stanford
Bookstore during China Week,
and passers-by can express
their gripes and praises of the
university, the country, and
life in general. All activities of
China Week will be free, but
the sponsoring groups face
costs for the speakers and
films, so donations will be
accepted at the door.
