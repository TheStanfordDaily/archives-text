# David Harris: Out Of 'The Joint'
## 
### 
Former student body president David Harris
was released from a Texas prison March 15
after serving 20 months of a three-year sentence
for draft evasion. While in jail, Harris led a num
ber of highly-publicized hunger strikes and was
involved in a controversial marijuana possession
incident.
Four days after his release, Harris and his
wife, folksinger Joan Baez, were interviewed by
reporters Bill Evers and Ed Kohn. The following
comments are excerpted from that two and one
half hour conversation.
/ was up at your March 15 press conference at
the airport. . . and / think that the first thing
you said as you got off the plane was that if what
you saw as you looked out of the airplane win
dows was any indication, you still have a lot of
work to do.
What did you see out the airplane window?
Harris: What you people live in every day. I
mean, you first have to understand the context
I'm coming from. You know, I've been in a sev
en-by-nine piece of concrete painted as close to
the color of dead flesh after it's been in the
ground for six or eight months as it can get. 1
lived in that for four years straight, and 1 lived in
various other places before that, other jails, the
kind I ended up in. I stayed in that thing for a
year, and you live inside that and you walk in the
corridors and the only time you get out into
open spacc you look over your right shoulder
and there's a 20-foot-high tower and a dude sit
ting there with a 30.06 and you look over your
left shoulder and a dude with another 30.06, and
tnere's a guy driving around in a truck around
the outside of the fence and he's got a .38 strap
ped to his hip.
I'm saying is that's the context, and any hu
man being adjusts to the context that he's in and
you learn to make that liveable, and you live
with that in your mind all the time. With living
with that in my mind all the time, with the
sound of gates opening and closing, and hacks
walking up and down and keys jangling, and you
know like I haven't even turned on a fucking
light switch in 20 months. Like you walk over
there and turn on that light switch, and you
don't notice it. I walk over there and turn on
that light switch and I remember that there was
no light switch for me to turn on. Coming out of
that context, all of a sudden, you see a thing full
of roads and you see people walking around, and
you see smoke all up in the air and you get to the
airport and people are flying all kinds of differ
ent directions. 1 hadn't walked more than four
hundred yards in one direction in over a year,
you know, and so you ask yourself, 'well, where
are all those people going' and I still don't know
where they're going.
You know that some of them, they're going
off to righteously kill people, there are others
who are going off to do the same thing only in
much lower terms, and go off and exploit people,
they go off and steal from them, they go off and
keep those people's faces, and all of us know
how to see behind somebody's face if we really
want to do it. I walk into that, and I think,
'Wow. I have some work to do'.
The thing I'm sure about is that I'm about
trying to lessen that kind of pain that people
insist on living in. I'm about trying to somehow
reverse that cycle which is going to end up with
people destroying each other as human beings,
maybe physically surviving — there's that outside
chance we might physically survive - but certain
ly not as anything resembling human beings.
That's my work.
The need I feel at this point - it is very hard to
start laying down specifics because I'm not ac
quainted with specifics - is that I really see the
need to put together an organization.
How many people are still in anything called the
Resistance? I gather there are some groups still
going.
Harris: There are various groups calling themsel
ves the Resistance. I don't know if I'm attached
to the name Resistance; I liked it. Organization
ally, the Resistance has fallen largely apart, and I
think that's a good thing. I think that organiza
tions have limited kinds of usefulness.
You make an organization to accomplish cer
tain things. I'm not going to talk in terms of final
success. I'm a political organizer, and I don't
know how to talk in terms of final success. What
terms I can talk in is to talk about where we
began and where we are at this point. And draft

resistance is successful. It takes the government
two people to get one into the army.
Do you think your twenty months in jail helped
to stop the war? Did it serve any constructive
purpose in a larger context than just your own
draft resistance?
Harris: I don't know. I think it had a great deal
of political meaning, disconnected from me as a
person. The fact that 1 wasn't the only dude in
jail for it, and the fact that all those people did
that, is a very real political fact.
What do you think of the contention that all
persons now in prison are political prisoners?
Harris: It's obviously true. First you try to estab
lish what a political prisoner means. What it
means is somebody whose crime is dependent on
the political structure in which he lives. If you
apply that definition to all the people in the
joint, you find out that they're all political pris
oners. What I'm saying is that there is nothing in
the things that they did themselves that should in
and of itself put them in the joint. There are
murderers in the joint. I've lived with murderers.
There arc thieves, there are extortionists, there
are dope fiends. . . there's any number of those
kinds of people.
The point is — not that those people didn't do
that and not that some of those things aren't bad
I'm not trying to say that the dude who goes
out and blows somebody away is really good
but I'm trying to say that when these sons-of
bitches sitting in Washington blow away 2000 or
3000 people in a day it's a political crime to be
in for murder because they aren't locking up all
the murderers. They're locking up a few of the
murderers. And when you only lock up a few of
the murderers, then it's a political decision about
which murderers get locked up. Now if they were
locking up all the murderers, it wouldn't be a
political crime.
Were there any incidents that happened to you
during your imprisonment that you would con
sider ... milestones... or that you would con
sider important events in your life, at least from
where you are now?
Harris: Sure, my son was born. If you want to
talk about a milestone, that's a milestone. I had
to pace up and down a fucking compound all
night knowing my wife was in labor and I could
n't be there and I couldn't help. I culdn't see all
that happen; she had to do it all by herself. Here
was this thing that I had been part of creating
and was of my flesh coming into the world and I

couldn't even be within a fucking thousand miles
of it. Then one day in the visiting yard, Joanie
shows up with this little bundle — I looked at it,
it's got a fucking dimple in its chin and I said,
'Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck is all this about.
1 didn't know this existed'.
How much were you two aole to see each other?
Were you able to write letters as often as you
wanted?
Baez: Yes, and we saw in La Tuna, where he
was. .. visiting hours were originally eight hours
a month. 1 think it was resistance types and their
wives were obnoxious enough so they raised it so
it came to around 15 hours a month.
Harris: This visiting isn't really human contact
either. You've got people that you love, that
you're intimate with, that you like to sit around
with and you get to do that in front of a bunch
of Peeping Toms.
Baez: The cops really peeped at David and I;just
about anybody I knew in there said that this was
true. They had the old spyglasses out, waiting for
any little thing and one day I happened to have
been crying - lots of stuff happens while you're
visiting - and I had my head on his shoulder, and
so the guard came over and I heard that old jin
gle, jingle, jingle; they usually call him off, be
cause they're too embarrassed to say anything in
front of a woman, but I just whirled around and
said, 'what is it,' and I knew what it was. And he
said, 'well, we're going to have to clean this visit
up, and I don't know which one of us fired first
but I just said something about that 1 was as
clean as you're going to get and (why don't you)
hit the breeze and then David gave him a few
lines and then . . .
Harris: He says to me that he's going to termin
ate the visit and 1 tell him he'd better bring some
friends.
Baez: And he said to me that I'd better terminate
the visit and I said he could terminate his part of
the visit but I'd stay until visiting hours were
over and then wc were really obnoxious because
visiting hours and at 3:30, and we usually all sift
out at around 3:25 — we wouldn't leave until
3:29:30, the three female resistance types in
there. He wanted to go back to wherever he had
to go back to, and we were watching to clock,
and we said we had another 30 seconds to go.
Harris: After that, they would leave and then I
would get taken down the corridor to the lieu
tenants office and go through all the stuff. Any
way, the dude gives me all this bullshit about
how I'm behaving out there in the visiting yard.
All you can tell a cop when he gets that kind of
weird is to fuck off.
What do they expect you to do?
Harris: They expect me to do anything they
want me to do. The point inside a prison is that
there's no 'thing' that's right or wrong. Like lots
of couples sit outside in the visiting yard and
neck. If I sit out in the visiting yard and neck,
I'm going to get called in and they're going to use
their regulations that way. They have a room this
big (Daily business office) in that fucking pris
on with walls of file cabinets, and those arc all
regulations.
Anytime they want to find a regulation on
you, they just pull it out and say, it says right
here you can't do that, you're violating a regula
tion and I say 'look man, I wasn't doing anythink
anybody else out there doesn't do, and I wasn't
doing anything wrong, and furthermore I resent
the implication behind what you're saying.' What
you really resent . . . there arc things you like
that arc really precious to you, thai are real to
you, thai you don't want the cops to get their
hands on and the cops always want their hands
on that, they want to control all your lite.
So they want to start telling me what my re
lationship with my wife is, and they try and tell
mc that I'm out there irying to cop a leel in the
visiiing yard, you know, gel my hands on some
snatch or something, because I'm locked up and
can't gel near a woman. I lold them, look, il thai
was the reason I married my wife, then I never

would have married her in the first place and
you're a son of a bitch for ever saying that.
What did you feel about political organizing in
the prisons. What about the hunger strikes that
we heard about. How were the press reports on
that?
Harris: I never saw any. Number one, you never
get to see the press reports. If you get in some
shit in the joint, and there's any press behind it —
whatever coverage there is of it will never get
inside the joint. They cut all that off. So I don't
know what the coverage of that was. I'm a politi
cal organizer, that's my life, and I wasn't about
to stop doing it when I was in prison.
You are dealing with a different kind of con
stituency. Remember all those guys in high
school who were supposed to be dumb? Remem
ber when you began school, you began dividing
between the people who were supposed to be
dumb and the people who were supposed to be
smart. And all of us who were supposed to be
smart ended up in shitholes like this (Stanford).
And all the ones who were supposed to be dumb
ended up in shitholes like that. Well. 1 sort of felt
that I had made a circle of my life and got back
together with those dudes I used to kick around
with in kindergarten and first grade . . .
Did you have any trouble talking with them?
Harris: No, we talk the same language. We have
lots of things to share. Despite having been at
Stanford University I hadn't led a secluded life.
I've ridden freights and shot dope and fucked
around and been in fights and played basketball
and done lots of other things, so 1 have plenty to
begin a conversation with.
Plus, those guys aren't dummies, you know;
there are a lot of very bright people in joints;
they may be dope fiends, and they may be car
thieves, but they're not that dumb, and they're
very interested in knowing stuff. They have real
political feelings. They have very real immediate
political grievances.
You're caged like a goddamned animal, and
anything you want, you have to fight for. I don't
necessarily mean physically fight; but I mean
anything you want, that's an extension of you as
you see yourself as a human being, you're going
to have to go out and get from the cops. Now
there's some who turn out — you know, they
become snitches. They run around telling the
cops about all the rest of us. And they get some
goodies. They get a few extra cigarettes, and they

don't get hassled, and they get a little of this, and
they get a little of that.
But there are very few guys who will sink to
that, so the rest of them are left to either bearing
up under what there is or getting together and
fighting for something different. Now, getting to
gether and fighting for something different isn't
ordinary; most people just bear with what
they've got.
1 remember one strike happened when this
bank robber friend of mine, a black dude, he and
1 were walking across the yard, and I said, 'you
know, maybe we ought to stick it to these
people, things are really getting weird around
here.' He said, 'yes', and we talked to a couple of
guys, and they said, 'yes, digit' and pretty soon,
we got it all through, and we got a list of de
mands written up, and we said, Monday morning,
nobody goes near the chow hall.' And sure
enough, Monday morning, we're standing out
there and we're waiting to watch to see who goes
to the chow hall and who doesn't.
There are the internals of it; you see that
maybe 70 percent of the population didn't go to
the chow hall, and you try and talk to dudes;
'hey man' — and here you wouldn't go to him
directly, there's too much pressure, but you go
to one of their friends' you know, let's say the
Mexicans, who hang out together, and you get
one of the dudes in the Mexicans who's solid
with you, and you say, 'hey man, we all got to
take care of our own people in here; some of
your people are going to the chow hall.' And the
dude says, 'yes, I know, they got no heart, but
I'll talk to them.' You work at it, and you try to
make it bigger and usually - at least the ones I
was in — there was always a solidarity pledge
amongst all the guys who were really at the cen
ter of it; you knew, we'd say, 'hey, they're going
to grab us up, and they're going to send us out,
and 1 don't know about the rest of you, but if
they grab any of you guys up, they're going to
have to grab me up, I ain't going to give them a
choice, I'm going to do things that they're going
to have to grab me up for.' And so you do it.
And that's how the strikes happen.
There are various kinds of political gains you
can make in one of these strikes; you set out
with different things in mind. One strike at Saf
ford we set out six demands about the food,
about having an inmate council, about the medi
cal thing about the one solid demand we really
won out with in the end was the medical techni
cians assistants, who ran the hospital, got moved,
which was a victory. The price we paid for that
victory: nine dudes sent over to La Tuna from
Safford, which means all nine of those dudes do
more time, anywhere from a month to five or six
months more inside the joint.
And somebody will say, 'well, that's a pretty
heavy price to pay,' which is the thing they're
always working against in prison. They can make
you pay prices, they can take a lot out of you,
because the good time is a standard thing; let's
say you're doing a three year sentence, you auto
matically earn six days a month knocked off the
end of your sentence. Well, you got some dudes
who are finishing off dimes. They've been doing
ten years. When the cops want to rip off his good
time, that's a lot of time.
What is your answer to the often-posed question:
What is to be done by the radical movement in
America?
Harris: I think a lot of people have begun to
understand that if they're serious about all the
words they've been throwing around, from 'make
love, not war' to 'community, not colonialism'
all those various slogans that have been thrown
down, and all the ideas that have been thrown
around about how people want to live, that they
want to live as sharing communities, that they
don't want to be involved in forcing suffering on
other people, they want all those kinds of things
for their lives and for the lives of people around
the world.
If you really mean that, at a certain point you
begin to understand what a serious proposition
that is and you begin to understand that what
stands between you and doing that is something
called American society, that is very big, and that it
is very powerful, and can inflict a lot of pain and
can really distort your life and lot when it wants
to put its foot down. 1 think people got scared,
and 1 don't think there's anything bad about
that, I think it's the most natural goddamned
thing in the world. I've been out in the forefront

'I would say that Vm somehow a crossbreed between an anarchist, a
socialist and a pacifist...l don 9 t believe in government; we 9 1l probably find
out our lives will be drastically improved by not having any government. 9

of that, I've been out on the head of that, and I
get scared.
You reach a certain point where you start run
ning around in circles, where you find yourself
milling around and nothing seems to be satisfy
ing. That's usually taken out in questions of tac
tics or questions of political theory. Up against
that fact, people seem to take it in terms of say
ing 'well, these tactics just don't seem to work
any more — like marches. We've all been march
ing, we can't march any more' or they'll say
'non-violence obviously doesn't work, what we
really need is some new kind of political under
standing' so everybody all of a sudden runs off
and becomes Maoists, and from Maoists they be
come super-Maoists, and from super Maoists to
armed love, and from armed love to machine gun
mechanics.
The problem isn't that non-violence, because
non-violence was really rarely done, at least as I
understand it. The problem wasn't that we didn't
have the proper political theory, and the problem
wasn't that a certain set of tactics were used up.
The problem was that it didn't have the flesh; it
didn't have the meat to put behind it. The level
of seriousness on the part of the people wasn't
there.
Why do you think that?
Harris: Because I think it's a frightening proposi
tion to give up everything that you know is the
secure life and go out and make a life on your
own in a context of conflict, in a context where
you're going to have to pay prices, in a situation
where you're going to have to do things like to to
the joint.
All the stuff that happened after Cambodia -
the people who did that stayed here (at Stan
ford). I think that is a real indication of what
everybody's hung up on. I don't really think it's
a big question anymore about what the Univer
sity is. I think that, too, is an established truth
that most of us deal with.
Now I'm not saying that there aren't good
parts to a person's experience at the University,
because I'd be lying about myself. I had some
good experiences at the University. I don't think
they were a function of the University. But I also
know that the University itself is really a dead
end; it's a way of killing yourself, slow but sure,
putting yourself in a social groove that's going to
kill you. Ft's going to put you in a social groove
that's going to make it impossible to do all those
things that you we're talking about, all those
things that people seem to want.
In order to liberate enough energy to go on
and really pursue those things, it means people
personally and collectively sitting down and mak
ing real decisions about the kind of things they're
doing with their own lives. I think one of those
thi e .\ means leaving school. Forgetting even for
a second what school is, just noticing one part of
it which is its dependence, its completely depen
dent situation, however you want to look at it,
or however you do your time in school, it's a
dependent situation.
Look. The people out there on the streets
aren't by definition for you or against you.
They have a lot of prejudices, they have a
lot of addictions, like to the American flag
and the American military. But the most im
portant thing about them is they're very scar
ed about the world they live in, too; they're
not comfortable in it. You're not going to
find those people comfortable in it. If you
present yourself as the threat to their comfort,
and let the government play you off as a threat
to their comfort, they're always going to be your
enemy. If you approach it in such a way that's
designed to really develop their fear instead of
their trust in you, then they're always going to
be scared of you.
I think that for a long time there's been a
notion that political power is something that
frightens people, because we're all frightened of
the American state. I think that's one of the rea
sons everybody has been jumping head over tails
to bee me a Marxist. We grew up through that,
we grew up through McCarthy, we grew up learn
ing that the great devil menace was the commun
ist. The communist was the person who was
somehow going to tear down all of this through
all kinds of devious means and was so powerful
that we had to put 20 percent of our national
budget just to hire enough people to watch them;
which we all know is a myth. So when you be
came a communist, when you went up to the
dude on the street and said, 'hey, man, I'm a
communist' and the dude goes 'wheeeew' . , .-
'And you turn to your friend, and you say, 'hey
man, did you see what we did to those people?'
That's the way to get something done. People
happen to think they're powerful bccause Amer
ica is full of paranoids, ~nd extending that para
noia, you're doing something.
I think when you get down to talking about
base building, you're talking about building your
self into a situation where people see you in a
certain way. And I don't think that what people
at this point need is enemies. What they need is
people they can trust, what they need is people
they can get next to.
I really seriously consider myself a revolution
ary. That puts me immediately classified with a
whole set of people whom I can't stand, who I
don't think arc revolutionaries, who make no
sense to me at all. The object of revolution is
trying to turn that work around so it's not a
frightening thing to people, so that it really
means going to the root of social problems and
developing a whole new rhythm and a whole new
style for dealing with those.
I think that very few people are interested in
that. I think that, whether they like it or not,
they're interested in certain basic kinds of Ameri
can virtues, if you can call them virtues — they're
certainly cultural attributes. I think that there
arc just a hell of a lot of dudes, at least when I
read the newspapers and tried to figure out what
the hell was happening, who were playing John
Wayne. It was stand up and denigrate all the
world John Wayne lives in for hours and hours

and hours in the most violent and hard terms
they (could).
The point is that a lot of people are playing
that same machismo thing as John Wayne, except
that they now look more like a gorilla than a
soap ad; they're playing the same thing, running
down the hill, firing their gun over their machete
killing the capitalist pigs.
And it's just as big a fantasy. They have devel
oped for themselves a whole fantasy world to go
and act out. As far as I'm concerned, people's
fantasies belong to those people and they're free
to act them out, except when they really start
huring other people. And they're now in the
business of hurting other people.
What about those who advocate fighting the po
lice?
Harris: I don't like cops, I've been 20 months in
prison locked up with cops, and cops did very
bad things to me, and I understand very much
what it is to be a cop, and to be a cop is to make
everybody's life you encounter as hard to live for
them as possible, but cops are still human beings,
cop is a job, behind a job there is a real living
dude who generally is just as fucked up as the
rest of us, who got forced into it.
There are lots of people running around talk
ing about killing them, and they get paranoid,
and they get mean, because you don't act like a
cop for very long without it getting to you, and
you're going to end up mean behind that, but
they're still human beings, and when you take
one of those dudes and you go out and blow him
away, and he's got a wife and three kids, 1 feel
for that wife and three kids even though I hate
cops. I don't think anybody has the right to go
out and blow him away.
Someone is just a big fool if he thinks that
we're going to get out of this political situation
without each other. The one thing I'm really con
vinced of is that we're going to get out of it
together all in one piece or we're not going to get
out of it at all. And that's everybody: all the
lowdown redneck motherfuckers, and the Rich
ard Nixons and the cops and the blacks and the
chicanos and the dope fiends, and you take that
whole conglomerate that America is, and if you
can't put it together again, not like it was, but
put it together again, we won't make it out.
What are your current political views?
Harris: 1 would say that I'm somehow a cross
breed between an anarchist, a socialist and a paci
fist. I am not a traditional pacifist by any means,
there's a whole style associated with that that 1
don't shaie, and some content that I don't share;
I'm not a traditional anarchist by any means be
cause most of the traditional anarchists really be
lieved in blowing people up, and I couldn't do
that; and I'm not a traditional socialist because
most of the traditional socialists are state central
istis, they really believe in government. I don't
believe in government; I believe that it's perfectly
possible for all of us to live without a govern
ment, and we'll probably find that our lives will
be drastically improved by not having any
government.
By governing ourselves by a process of spon
taneous association and genuine care for human
kind, a genuine sense of love for our fellow man,
I think is a motivating force that can be martial
led into a social system that makes it very easy
for people to live and very fun for people to live
and very possible for people to live in ways they
never imagined they could before. That's my po
litics.
What was the story on that marijuana inci
dent. . . ?
Harris: Bullshit.
Did they plant it?
Harris: Yes. I don't know actually what happen
ed. All I know is that 1 never had any marijuana.
I'll tell you the incident, it was a simple incident.
I'm out working, out trimming hedges. Two cops
drive up in a truck, I'm working outside of the
walls, at that time I was a minimum security pris
oner. The two cops come up and say, 'we're go
ing to shake you down.' I say, 'ok, gassy,' I get
shook down about eight, ten times a day.
1 have a coat on, and the traditional pattern
for being shook down is you're supposed to
reach in your pockets and take everything out of
your pockets. Hold your hands up over your
head like that; they slap you, then you turn your
hands over, they take the shit out of your hands.
I have my hands up over my head waiting for
them to slap me, and all of a sudden they grab
both my hands and almost pulled me over.
They jumped me; pulled all of the shit out of
my hands-they don't look at it—you know there
is a pair of gloves, a pipe, some cigarettes, tobac
co, there's various things, I collected a bunch of
shit in my pockets. They just hold on to it.
I say, 'Hey, what's happening?' They say
' shut up and wait for the captain to get here.'
So, I wait for the captain to get there, and the
captain drives up with two more hacks. So there
are five hacks there altogether, including the
captain. Three of the hacks take me into a room
and close the door, and strip search me -you
know, look up my ass-hole, check under my
nuts, look down your throat, do all that, and
check through all your clothes. And so they do
that, and I'm clean; I get my stuff back on and
I'm waiting.
The other two dudes come in from outside
and the captain's got a number in his hand. I
look at that, and lie looks at me. I say 'Hey,
ain't no way that's mine.' So I go to the hole.
They tell me 'we have reason to believe that you
were in possession of some marijuana.' So I said
' What reason do you have to believe that?' And
he said ' Well, two police testified that they took
it off you.' And I said, 'Well they're lying
through their teeth.'
I'm not showing it, but I'm scared. That's ten
years. Contraband on a federal reservation is ten
years, and I saw two friends of mine get ten years
for coining in with a boot full of stuff. I don't
want that ten years laid on the back of what I'm

doing. I got interrogated by the FBI the next day
and they dropped charges.
What sort of disruption in your life lias the hiatus
of the twenty-month prison term been?
Harris: You can't understand being in the joint
until you've been in the joint, but if you want to
try, one way you can try is that when 1 walked
out those doors I didn't know anybody. There
were a lot of people I was very close with, like
my wife, I love my wife, she and I were very
close before I left. I'm a stranger now to her, and
she's a stranger to me. It's very weird. When you
see the face and you know the face, but you
don't know the mind behind it.
One branch of the peace movement that existed
when you went into prison became less political
and went into mysticism and vegetarianism What
about the counter culture?
Harris: Along with the rise of the whole neo-
Marxist set has come the rise of the space cadets.
I think there is a lot of what I consider space
cadetism running around. If you spread organic
honey on your toast every morning somehow the
world's going to turn out alright. I'm all for or
ganic honey, I'm all for people eating good
healthy food and taking care of their bodies. I'm
all for that. I don't think it's going to make a
difference in whether there's an atomic holocaust
or not; I don't think it's going to make a differ
ence as to whether people keep starving or
people keep being napalmed. 1 think it's going to
make a difference for the people who eat organic
honey. But, amongst the world's famousvegetar
ians is Adolf Hitler. One should remember that.
I'm not convinced the root of the problem is the
meateaters.
Do you know Bruce Franklin at all?
Harris: We were never close friends. We had lots
of political associations. One of the last things I
did was to debate Bruce Franklin before I went
to jail. The last time 1 saw him I found him a
likeable guy, a very nicc guy; and a fanatic, and
wrong. His politics make no sense to me. I think
just as we're talking about lots of other people
falling back on an authoritarian system, you can
talk about Bruce that way too. Something must
be very satisfying for Bruce to know the ultimate
truth is bound up in Chairman Mao . . .
I also have no doubt if Bruce Franklin found
himself in a position of power, that he would put
people in prison; that he would put people up
against walls, that he would blow people away:
that the quality of mercy which is a very nice
thing in human beings would not be demonstrat
ed.
Your wife is on record with some really blistering
attacks against some aspects of Women's Lib
eration. What is your feeling?
Harris: It's all really fresh to me. I've only been
doing it for the past three days. And before that
I was a convict. And before that 1 didn't under
stand it nearly as well as 1 do now. In the idea of
our marriage it's not like she's supposed to take
care of the baby, and she's supposed to do the
dishes. What we try to say is that for two people
to live together there's a certain amount of work
which develops, and that we share doing that.
None of the work is necessarily more valuable
than the other work. We try and find a way of
being equals in that.
In many ways you're suggesting that, at least
among two people very close, what we think of
in social terms as the division of labor, specializa
tion, is not an appropriate way to approach any
thing.
Harris: I'm saying that with two people there's
no need for either of them to be specialists; it
only makes it harder for them to be two people
together.

What do you (Baez) think about this question?
Baez: My antagonism about it was there because
of some of the styles that I've seen, most of the
styles that I've seen. But, as far as thinking wo
men's lib is a necessity, I think it is an absolute
necessity. I don't think before David went in that
either of us had thought very much about it.
Harris: The real problem is male liberation any
way. One of the ridiculous assumptions that this
civilization seems to have operated on is that
somehow you are liberated if you get to control
a lot of people.
In other words both the slave and the master
have to be liberated?
Baez: Of course.
Harris: Precisely! It is very easy to talk about it
in terms of the women's problem. It's not the
women's problem. Unless women are going to
live by themselves and men are going to live by
themselves, it's not the women's problem. It's a
human problem.
There was generated last Spring as a result of
Cambodia a eon side rable number of students
who were trying to channel their energies into
revamping or harrassing or shooting their meth
adone into the veins of the political system. Are
these people real? How do you look on activities
of this kind?
Harris: The chief thing that you can say is that
they're missing the point. My general contact — 1
had a lot of contact with McCarthy people — I
think that they've missed the point about Ameri
ca. The political system does not respond to real
human needs; it does not take real human needs
into consideration. Not because of the people in
it. It's not because Richard Nixon's a son-of-a
bitch — and he may very well be a son-of-a-bitch
but that's irrelevant. What 1 mean is it's irrele
vant to the real political question. The real politi
cal question is the shape of all these various so
cial patterns that America runs around in. Until
the shape and the nature of those political pat
terns is changed, the political dynamic and its
end effect are going to be the same if you have
Jesus Christ himself as President. When you go to
the beach and sec somebody surfing your re
sponse is not to say 'wow look at that cat push
that wave around.' It's the same with politicians.
Politicians don't make it go. Politicians sit on top
and ride it.

When the shape and nature of American so
ciety has changed then maybe there'll be a dis
connection with the politicians. I don't care if
they're running Jesus Christ. 1 don't want Jesus
Christ messing with my life either. ll' he came in
and told me that he was going to decide what
happened with my wile and family and some
body else's wife and family and these people
were going to go there and these people were
going to be rich and these people were going to
be poor, I'd tell him 'Fuck you.' I'd do every
thing I could to stop him, too.
The political dynamic they're engaged in is
based on the root assumption that people ought
to hand over the real decisions in their lives to
other people who are somehow more fit to make
them. And they aren't more fit to make them.
You cease being a human being at the point you
hand those decisions over. The process itself is
dehumanizing, whoever is in it and however it
runs.
I think the people who are involved in that
process have lots of good motivations. I'd give a
hundred hurrahs for their motivation.
Forgetting about the problems of institutions,
think of patterns of behavior. Think of a society
as a series of flows, like a number of rivers run
ning within a certain area. Its a number of lines
painted on the floor and people fall into those
lines. Now some of those lines are painted in very
small distances; some are painted in very big dis
tances. I look on a society as that kind of pattern
— the pattern of people following their lives.
If you're talking about changing those pat
terns of behavior, you're seriously talking about
changing people's understanding. And you're se
riously talking about institutionalized kinds of
forms.
Like the institutionalized form of dealing with
people a great deal of distance from you is the
military, which is essentially institutionalized be
lligerence, and institutionalized coersion. I think
you can institutionalize different ways of dealing
with people whose names you don't know and
whose faces you don't see. I think an example of
that would be a general love for human kind in
stead of a general suspicion of anything that's
considered foreign. Then, instead of falling back
on hardened belligerents such as the nation and
state you fall back on the idea that we're all
members of human kind.
