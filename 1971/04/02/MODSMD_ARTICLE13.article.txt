# David Harris: Out Of 'The Joint'
## 
### 
Former student body president David Harris
was released from a Texas prison March 15
after serving 20 months of a three-year sentence
for draft evasion. While in jail, Harris led a num
ber of highly-publicized hunger strikes and was
involved in a controversial marijuana possession
incident.
Four days after his release, Harris and his
wife, folksinger Joan Baez, were interviewed by
reporters Bill Evers and Ed Kohn. The following
comments are excerpted from that two and one
half hour conversation.
/ was up at your March 15 press conference at
the airport. . . and / think that the first thing
you said as you got off the plane was that if what
you saw as you looked out of the airplane win
dows was any indication, you still have a lot of
work to do.
What did you see out the airplane window?
Harris: What you people live in every day. I
mean, you first have to understand the context
I'm coming from. You know, I've been in a sev
en-by-nine piece of concrete painted as close to
the color of dead flesh after it's been in the
ground for six or eight months as it can get. 1
lived in that for four years straight, and 1 lived in
various other places before that, other jails, the
kind I ended up in. I stayed in that thing for a
year, and you live inside that and you walk in the
corridors and the only time you get out into
open spacc you look over your right shoulder
and there's a 20-foot-high tower and a dude sit
ting there with a 30.06 and you look over your
left shoulder and a dude with another 30.06, and
tnere's a guy driving around in a truck around
the outside of the fence and he's got a .38 strap
ped to his hip.
I'm saying is that's the context, and any hu
man being adjusts to the context that he's in and
you learn to make that liveable, and you live
with that in your mind all the time. With living
with that in my mind all the time, with the
sound of gates opening and closing, and hacks
walking up and down and keys jangling, and you
know like I haven't even turned on a fucking
light switch in 20 months. Like you walk over
there and turn on that light switch, and you
don't notice it. I walk over there and turn on
that light switch and I remember that there was
no light switch for me to turn on. Coming out of
that context, all of a sudden, you see a thing full
of roads and you see people walking around, and
you see smoke all up in the air and you get to the
airport and people are flying all kinds of differ
ent directions. 1 hadn't walked more than four
hundred yards in one direction in over a year,
you know, and so you ask yourself, 'well, where
are all those people going' and I still don't know
where they're going.
You know that some of them, they're going
off to righteously kill people, there are others
who are going off to do the same thing only in
much lower terms, and go off and exploit people,
they go off and steal from them, they go off and
keep those people's faces, and all of us know
how to see behind somebody's face if we really
want to do it. I walk into that, and I think,
'Wow. I have some work to do'.
The thing I'm sure about is that I'm about
trying to lessen that kind of pain that people
insist on living in. I'm about trying to somehow
reverse that cycle which is going to end up with
people destroying each other as human beings,
maybe physically surviving — there's that outside
chance we might physically survive - but certain
ly not as anything resembling human beings.
That's my work.
The need I feel at this point - it is very hard to
start laying down specifics because I'm not ac
quainted with specifics - is that I really see the
need to put together an organization.
How many people are still in anything called the
Resistance? I gather there are some groups still
going.
Harris: There are various groups calling themsel
ves the Resistance. I don't know if I'm attached
to the name Resistance; I liked it. Organization
ally, the Resistance has fallen largely apart, and I
think that's a good thing. I think that organiza
tions have limited kinds of usefulness.
You make an organization to accomplish cer
tain things. I'm not going to talk in terms of final
success. I'm a political organizer, and I don't
know how to talk in terms of final success. What
terms I can talk in is to talk about where we
began and where we are at this point. And draft

resistance is successful. It takes the government
two people to get one into the army.
Do you think your twenty months in jail helped
to stop the war? Did it serve any constructive
purpose in a larger context than just your own
draft resistance?
Harris: I don't know. I think it had a great deal
of political meaning, disconnected from me as a
person. The fact that 1 wasn't the only dude in
jail for it, and the fact that all those people did
that, is a very real political fact.
What do you think of the contention that all
persons now in prison are political prisoners?
Harris: It's obviously true. First you try to estab
lish what a political prisoner means. What it
means is somebody whose crime is dependent on
the political structure in which he lives. If you
apply that definition to all the people in the
joint, you find out that they're all political pris
oners. What I'm saying is that there is nothing in
the things that they did themselves that should in
and of itself put them in the joint. There are
murderers in the joint. I've lived with murderers.
There arc thieves, there are extortionists, there
are dope fiends. . . there's any number of those
kinds of people.
The point is — not that those people didn't do
that and not that some of those things aren't bad
I'm not trying to say that the dude who goes
out and blows somebody away is really good
but I'm trying to say that when these sons-of
bitches sitting in Washington blow away 2000 or
3000 people in a day it's a political crime to be
in for murder because they aren't locking up all
the murderers. They're locking up a few of the
murderers. And when you only lock up a few of
the murderers, then it's a political decision about
which murderers get locked up. Now if they were
locking up all the murderers, it wouldn't be a
political crime.
Were there any incidents that happened to you
during your imprisonment that you would con
sider ... milestones... or that you would con
sider important events in your life, at least from
where you are now?
Harris: Sure, my son was born. If you want to
talk about a milestone, that's a milestone. I had
to pace up and down a fucking compound all
night knowing my wife was in labor and I could
n't be there and I couldn't help. I culdn't see all
that happen; she had to do it all by herself. Here
was this thing that I had been part of creating
and was of my flesh coming into the world and I

couldn't even be within a fucking thousand miles
of it. Then one day in the visiting yard, Joanie
shows up with this little bundle — I looked at it,
it's got a fucking dimple in its chin and I said,
'Oh, Jesus Christ. What the fuck is all this about.
1 didn't know this existed'.
How much were you two aole to see each other?
Were you able to write letters as often as you
wanted?
Baez: Yes, and we saw in La Tuna, where he
was. .. visiting hours were originally eight hours
a month. 1 think it was resistance types and their
wives were obnoxious enough so they raised it so
it came to around 15 hours a month.
Harris: This visiting isn't really human contact
either. You've got people that you love, that
you're intimate with, that you like to sit around
with and you get to do that in front of a bunch
of Peeping Toms.
Baez: The cops really peeped at David and I;just
about anybody I knew in there said that this was
true. They had the old spyglasses out, waiting for
any little thing and one day I happened to have
been crying - lots of stuff happens while you're
visiting - and I had my head on his shoulder, and
so the guard came over and I heard that old jin
gle, jingle, jingle; they usually call him off, be
cause they're too embarrassed to say anything in
front of a woman, but I just whirled around and
said, 'what is it,' and I knew what it was. And he
said, 'well, we're going to have to clean this visit
up, and I don't know which one of us fired first
but I just said something about that 1 was as
clean as you're going to get and (why don't you)
hit the breeze and then David gave him a few
lines and then . . .
Harris: He says to me that he's going to termin
ate the visit and 1 tell him he'd better bring some
friends.
Baez: And he said to me that I'd better terminate
the visit and I said he could terminate his part of
the visit but I'd stay until visiting hours were
over and then wc were really obnoxious because
visiting hours and at 3:30, and we usually all sift
out at around 3:25 — we wouldn't leave until
3:29:30, the three female resistance types in
there. He wanted to go back to wherever he had
to go back to, and we were watching to clock,
and we said we had another 30 seconds to go.
Harris: After that, they would leave and then I
would get taken down the corridor to the lieu
tenants office and go through all the stuff. Any
way, the dude gives me all this bullshit about
how I'm behaving out there in the visiting yard.
All you can tell a cop when he gets that kind of
weird is to fuck off.
What do they expect you to do?
Harris: They expect me to do anything they
want me to do. The point inside a prison is that
there's no 'thing' that's right or wrong. Like lots
of couples sit outside in the visiting yard and
neck. If I sit out in the visiting yard and neck,
I'm going to get called in and they're going to use
their regulations that way. They have a room this
big (Daily business office) in that fucking pris
on with walls of file cabinets, and those arc all
regulations.
Anytime they want to find a regulation on
you, they just pull it out and say, it says right
here you can't do that, you're violating a regula
tion and I say 'look man, I wasn't doing anythink
anybody else out there doesn't do, and I wasn't
doing anything wrong, and furthermore I resent
the implication behind what you're saying.' What
you really resent . . . there arc things you like
that arc really precious to you, thai are real to
you, thai you don't want the cops to get their
hands on and the cops always want their hands
on that, they want to control all your lite.
So they want to start telling me what my re
lationship with my wife is, and they try and tell
mc that I'm out there irying to cop a leel in the
visiiing yard, you know, gel my hands on some
snatch or something, because I'm locked up and
can't gel near a woman. I lold them, look, il thai
was the reason I married my wife, then I never

would have married her in the first place and
you're a son of a bitch for ever saying that.
What did you feel about political organizing in
the prisons. What about the hunger strikes that
we heard about. How were the press reports on
that?
Harris: I never saw any. Number one, you never
get to see the press reports. If you get in some
shit in the joint, and there's any press behind it —
whatever coverage there is of it will never get
inside the joint. They cut all that off. So I don't
know what the coverage of that was. I'm a politi
cal organizer, that's my life, and I wasn't about
to stop doing it when I was in prison.
You are dealing with a different kind of con
stituency. Remember all those guys in high
school who were supposed to be dumb? Remem
ber when you began school, you began dividing
between the people who were supposed to be
dumb and the people who were supposed to be
smart. And all of us who were supposed to be
smart ended up in shitholes like this (Stanford).
And all the ones who were supposed to be dumb
ended up in shitholes like that. Well. 1 sort of felt
that I had made a circle of my life and got back
together with those dudes I used to kick around
with in kindergarten and first grade . . .
Did you have any trouble talking with them?
Harris: No, we talk the same language. We have
lots of things to share. Despite having been at
Stanford University I hadn't led a secluded life.
I've ridden freights and shot dope and fucked
around and been in fights and played basketball
and done lots of other things, so 1 have plenty to
begin a conversation with.
Plus, those guys aren't dummies, you know;
there are a lot of very bright people in joints;
they may be dope fiends, and they may be car
thieves, but they're not that dumb, and they're
very interested in knowing stuff. They have real
political feelings. They have very real immediate
political grievances.
You're caged like a goddamned animal, and
anything you want, you have to fight for. I don't
necessarily mean physically fight; but I mean
anything you want, that's an extension of you as
you see yourself as a human being, you're going
to have to go out and get from the cops. Now
there's some who turn out — you know, they
become snitches. They run around telling the
cops about all the rest of us. And they get some
goodies. They get a few extra cigarettes, and they

don't get hassled, and they get a little of this, and
they get a little of that.
But there are very few guys who will sink to
that, so the rest of them are left to either bearing
up under what there is or getting together and
fighting for something different. Now, getting to
gether and fighting for something different isn't
ordinary; most people just bear with what
they've got.
1 remember one strike happened when this
bank robber friend of mine, a black dude, he and
1 were walking across the yard, and I said, 'you
know, maybe we ought to stick it to these
people, things are really getting weird around
here.' He said, 'yes', and we talked to a couple of
guys, and they said, 'yes, digit' and pretty soon,
we got it all through, and we got a list of de
mands written up, and we said, Monday morning,
nobody goes near the chow hall.' And sure
enough, Monday morning, we're standing out
there and we're waiting to watch to see who goes
to the chow hall and who doesn't.
There are the internals of it; you see that
maybe 70 percent of the population didn't go to
the chow hall, and you try and talk to dudes;
'hey man' — and here you wouldn't go to him
directly, there's too much pressure, but you go
to one of their friends' you know, let's say the
Mexicans, who hang out together, and you get
one of the dudes in the Mexicans who's solid
with you, and you say, 'hey man, we all got to
take care of our own people in here; some of
your people are going to the chow hall.' And the
dude says, 'yes, I know, they got no heart, but
I'll talk to them.' You work at it, and you try to
make it bigger and usually - at least the ones I
was in — there was always a solidarity pledge
amongst all the guys who were really at the cen
ter of it; you knew, we'd say, 'hey, they're going
to grab us up, and they're going to send us out,
and 1 don't know about the rest of you, but if
they grab any of you guys up, they're going to
have to grab me up, I ain't going to give them a
choice, I'm going to do things that they're going
to have to grab me up for.' And so you do it.
And that's how the strikes happen.
There are various kinds of political gains you
can make in one of these strikes; you set out
with different things in mind. One strike at Saf
ford we set out six demands about the food,
about having an inmate council, about the medi
cal thing about the one solid demand we really
won out with in the end was the medical techni
cians assistants, who ran the hospital, got moved,
which was a victory. The price we paid for that
victory: nine dudes sent over to La Tuna from
Safford, which means all nine of those dudes do
more time, anywhere from a month to five or six
months more inside the joint.
And somebody will say, 'well, that's a pretty
heavy price to pay,' which is the thing they're
always working against in prison. They can make
you pay prices, they can take a lot out of you,
because the good time is a standard thing; let's
say you're doing a three year sentence, you auto
matically earn six days a month knocked off the
end of your sentence. Well, you got some dudes
who are finishing off dimes. They've been doing
ten years. When the cops want to rip off his good
time, that's a lot of time.
What is your answer to the often-posed question:
What is to be done by the radical movement in
America?
Harris: I think a lot of people have begun to
understand that if they're serious about all the
words they've been throwing around, from 'make
love, not war' to 'community, not colonialism'
all those various slogans that have been thrown
down, and all the ideas that have been thrown
around about how people want to live, that they
want to live as sharing communities, that they
don't want to be involved in forcing suffering on
other people, they want all those kinds of things
for their lives and for the lives of people around
the world.
If you really mean that, at a certain point you
begin to understand what a serious proposition
that is and you begin to understand that what
stands between you and doing that is something
called American society, that is very big, and that it
is very powerful, and can inflict a lot of pain and
can really distort your life and lot when it wants
to put its foot down. 1 think people got scared,
and 1 don't think there's anything bad about
that, I think it's the most natural goddamned
thing in the world. I've been out in the forefront
