# Laura Nyro To Sing Sunday
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
v Laura Nyro will be appearing this Sunday, April
>J, with folk singer Don Cooper as part of the
1 ASSLFs Special Events Board series of concerts.
Nyro, who is known in some circles as an urban
: madonna and in others as a bitch, is certainly one of
. 4he most dramatic and powerful songwriters and
fingers around, and her live performances are always
for their intensity and vitality.
L Although Laura Nyro is presently the heroine of
"Jier own devoted cult, public acceptance has not
always been hers. She was a more than dismal
failure at Monterey several years ago, the victim of
both a manager who was trying to make her a
commercially attractive artist and an audience
which was not ready for her "Wedding Bell Blues,"
highly emotional music presented in an almost
style.
After a period of recovery and consolidation, she
made a reappearance with "Eli and the Thirteenth
Confession," considered by some to be the best ol
her four albums to date, and began to be
acknowledged as a significance and original artist.
Her music is characterized by its poetic and
intensely female quality, combining the strength of
Aretha with the insight and passion of Carole King.
Yet there are other qualities all her own, for her

songs convey both the feeling of New York City,
which provides their sooty, often lonely
background, and a sense of deep personal pain, her
own expression of woman's sorrows.
Her latest release "Christmas and the Beads of
Sweet" represents a more evolved effort that has
attracted a new audience, and at the same time
alienated some admirers of her more traditional
work. Added to her usual imaginative piano-playing
is a subtle winding orchestral background, much of
which was woven by producers Felix Cavaliere, of
the Rascals, and Arif Mardin, who also produces
Aretha Franklin.
The album assumes a different mood, however
(and some critics say more believable) when
performed live. Her solo piano accompaniment,
although occasionally overdone, is always
technically proficient and surprisingly successful in
echoing the soul of her voice.
Urban madonna or bitch, Laura Nyro will
perform this Sunday in Memorial Auditorium at
8:00 p.m. Student tickets cost $3.5 0.
She will sing like a screaming banshee and like a
dying flower and her amazing voice and music will
provide a brilliant show for all who are susceptible
to the charms and enticements of a very
complicated and talented woman.
