# 'Camper Culture' Rolls On
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
What links a mini-bike with a
portable toilet and sleeps six to
eight persons? It's a mountain
chalet, a beach cottage or a
$13,000 investment, in short, it's
the pick-up truck/camper
combination, the new showboat
of conspicuous consumption.
The sales of camper/truck
combinations or the more
elaborate mobile homes have been
increasing greatly in the past few
years. One local firm is chalking
up a 35% increase in sales over last
year.
Kenneth Giles of
Camper-Haven quotes prices for

the truck/camper starting at 5,000
but sells Taj Mahalish units all the
way up to $13,000. Open Road
campers, one of the biggest
national companies, start at
$4,635. The typical mobile home
ranges from $8,500 to $16,000
for the eight sleeper monster.
But now that you've put in the
last few scraps of your Irish
Sweepstakes winnings, what are
your new social outlest? Once you
have bought a camper, you can
join one of many national camper
clubs.
Camper Clubs
The "God Sam" clubs make ten

or fifteen tours yearly to Mexico
or Central America. The "one big
happy family" that results from
such trail blazing relationships is,
to say the least, gratifying.
Camperland, another marketer
in the area, offers membership in
the Open Road National Club.
Available to the new owner are
the national "Rovaramas,"
gigantic confabs of fellow
travelers all over the nation.
At the national meets, the
adventurers-of-the-left-gear can
exchange geographic patches, tales
of thrilling exploration on the
freeways, or gleefully reveal the
latest touch to their mobile
palace: stereo systems, hot water
showers, or wet bars are not
infrequent furnishings.
Close To Nature?
Camper enthusiasts are almost
fanatically loyal to their
machines. However, I wonder
where this group of Americans is
actually going.
First, while camping out in a
camper permits a person to get
"close to nature," he nonetheless
travels with all the accoutrements
of society. Just how "natural" is a
running shower or a color
television in Yosemite Park?

Many campers take our plastic
environment with them: It makes
the experience anything but a
clean break from one's confining
social role.
Seek Reassurance
Another unpleasant implication
of this type of travel is that, in
such a self-containing
environment, one seems to grope
for people like oneself, either to
share in the knowledge that one
spent so much for the camper or
just to reassure ones self of how
worthwhile all this is.
Finally, the element of physical
fitness is lost. Camping for many
enthusiasts is a form of
leafing-in-costume. The nature
hike, a former virtue of the
camper, is now the province of
the mini-bike, that fabulous
vehicle which combines the worst
qualities of both the automobile
with the motorcycle.
Or one sees often the high
power television antenna sticking
out of a camper park, proof that
the vacationer can still enjoy his
favorite activity even in a change
of scene.
Perhaps the camper/truck or
the lavish mobile home is the
compromise that society will have
to bear in trying to relate to
nature in a way that increasing
urbanization is negating. But a
return to the principles of
camping might turn the exercise
from a false experience into an
honest try at existing with nature.

camping might turn the exercise
from a false experience into an
honest try at existing with nature.
What links a mini-bike with a
portable toilet and sleeps six to
eight persons? It's a mountain
chalet, a beach cottage or a
$13,000 investment, in short, it's
the pick-up truck/camper
combination, the new showboat
of conspicuous consumption.
The sales of camper/truck
combinations or the more
elaborate mobile homes have been
increasing greatly in the past few
years. One local firm is chalking
up a 35% increase in sales over last
year.
Kenneth Giles of
Camper-Haven quotes prices for

the truck/camper starting at 5,000
but sells Taj Mahalish units all the
way up to $13,000. Open Road
campers, one of the biggest
national companies, start at
$4,635. The typical mobile home
ranges from $8,500 to $16,000
for the eight sleeper monster.
But now that you've put in the
last few scraps of your Irish
Sweepstakes winnings, what are
your new social outlest? Once you
have bought a camper, you can
join one of many national camper
clubs.
Camper Clubs
The "God Sam" clubs make ten

or fifteen tours yearly to Mexico
or Central America. The "one big
happy family" that results from
such trail blazing relationships is,
to say the least, gratifying.
Camperland, another marketer
in the area, offers membership in
the Open Road National Club.
Available to the new owner are
the national "Rovaramas,"
gigantic confabs of fellow
travelers all over the nation.
At the national meets, the
adventurers-of-the-left-gear can
exchange geographic patches, tales
of thrilling exploration on the
freeways, or gleefully reveal the
latest touch to their mobile
palace: stereo systems, hot water
showers, or wet bars are not
infrequent furnishings.
Close To Nature?
Camper enthusiasts are almost
fanatically loyal to their
machines. However, I wonder
where this group of Americans is
actually going.
First, while camping out in a
camper permits a person to get
"close to nature," he nonetheless
travels with all the accoutrements
of society. Just how "natural" is a
running shower or a color
television in Yosemite Park?

Many campers take our plastic
environment with them: It makes
the experience anything but a
clean break from one's confining
social role.
Seek Reassurance
Another unpleasant implication
of this type of travel is that, in
such a self-containing
environment, one seems to grope
for people like oneself, either to
share in the knowledge that one
spent so much for the camper or
just to reassure ones self of how
worthwhile all this is.
Finally, the element of physical
fitness is lost. Camping for many
enthusiasts is a form of
leafing-in-costume. The nature
hike, a former virtue of the
camper, is now the province of
the mini-bike, that fabulous
vehicle which combines the worst
qualities of both the automobile
with the motorcycle.
Or one sees often the high
power television antenna sticking
out of a camper park, proof that
the vacationer can still enjoy his
favorite activity even in a change
of scene.
Perhaps the camper/truck or
the lavish mobile home is the
compromise that society will have
to bear in trying to relate to
nature in a way that increasing
urbanization is negating. But a
return to the principles of
camping might turn the exercise
from a false experience into an
honest try at existing with nature.
