# Sha-Na-Na To Spur Nostalgia
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Jack up your 195 8 Cadillac. Peg your black levis
real tight and roll a pack of cigs in your sleeve. Get
out some vaseline and grease down your hair.
Sha-Na-Na's in town.
The saviors of the good ol' days of greasy hair
and bobby sox; of Elvis and Dion; of teen angels
and hearts on your chest, will relive the Fabulous
Fifties tonight at Memorial Auditorium at 8 :00 p.m.
These 12 recreators of another age are worth
seeing if only for the flashback to yesteryear.
Anyone who saw them perform "At the Hop" in
the movie Woodstock knows they're not about to
be mistaken for Country Joe or Joe Cocker or Sly
and the Family Stone.
To say they are unique is more than an
understatement. Not many contemporary groups
are into the music of the Monotones, the Cleftones
or The Big Bopper.
In 1958, when the Monotones first sang "Book of

Love," most of the members of Sha-Na-Na were
only eight or nine years old. About ten years after
the Monotones enchanted all those little chickies
out in radio land, the 12 members of the group were
all undergraduates at Columbia University
The 12 students got together and decided to
recreate the songs, dress and choreographic styles of
1950's rock and roll. They appeared at a Columbia
rock and roll revival, and soon after signed a
contract with Buddah Records.
Also appearing on tonight's bill will be the
well-known mentalist, Kreskin. Kreskin claims to be
a master of extrasensory perception and he has
appeared on the Mike Douglas, Merv Griffin and
Johnny Carson television shows.
Tickets at $3. for students and $3.50 for
non-students will be available at the door of Mem
Aud. So grab your chickie and head down to the
hop, cause "Wow man, like it's gonna be
nowsville.!"
