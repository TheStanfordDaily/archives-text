# 'Waterloo' Marks End Of Epic Movies
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Dino de Laurentis, the man
who brought you "War and
Peace" on celluloid, has returned
to the battlefield in the first film
record of the final demise of
Napoleon.
"Waterloo" is slick
Italo-Russian production being
released in this country by
Paramount pictures with two
blockbuster leads, Rod Steiger as
Napoleon, and Christopher
Plummer as the Duke of
Wellington. Steiger and Plummer
direct thousands of
period-costumed Russian army
extras in what has to be one of

the most amazing battle scenes of
all times.
After the entire battle of
Waterloo the viewer leaves the
theatre with his eyes smarting
from cannon smoke, his ears
deafened from the roar of the big
guns, his stomach turned by the
sight of horses being shot out
from under charging riders, and
his heart quite saddened at the
defeat of Steiger's Napoleon.
Steiger's intense presence
weaves an intricate tapestry of
one of history's most fantastic
characters. The emperor is
portrayed as a man with a
tremendous love of FVance and of
power-a man who would have
had both, if failing health had not
stopped him in his tracks. Steiger
builds the personality of a man
who can be loved by his people
and detested by his enemies, but
respected by both.
Vain Duke
Plummer as the Duke of
Wellington creates a character
much lesser in greatness and much
stronger in conceit. The Duke is
hardly as admirable as Napoleon
and De Laurentis conveys the
feeling that if Napoleon had been
healthy, Waterloo would have
been the Frenchman's greatest
victory rather than his final
defeat.
Plummer plays the Duke as a
man driven by his own self-love,
supremely self-confident of both
his personal magnetism and his
military abilities. Having a nip of
sherry with his generals before
battle, it seems like he wishes to
finish the bloody mess in time for
his motley group of English,
Scots, Prussians, and others to go
home to tea.
De Laurentis has made good
use of the talent he was provided
with. Small scenes where the two
commanders deal with their

generals or soliloquize are
skillfully and creatively shot.
Military Minds Clash
The director emphasizes
Waterloo as not just a battle
between armies but also as a
battle between the minds of
military men.
The Duke of Wellington is
trying to win the battle not just to
stop the threat of France but to
install himself as the foremost
military leader of the world.
The battle scene itself, which
comprises over half of the film, is
well done, if you like battle
scenes. Lines of colorful troops
from the foreground to the
horizon, slow motion cavalry
charges, brigades of musicians,
and white horses make the
bloodbath almost a ballet, but
final scenes panning over the acres
of downed soldiers on both sides
makes Waterloo more like a tragic
opera.
Senseless Carnage
The virtual uselessness of the
carnage re-emphasizes the futility
of war even though "Waterloo" is
billed as a recreation of the
greatest battle in history.
One more aspect of the film is
noteworthy for film buffs.
"Waterloo" represents what I
think will be one of the last few
epic pictures. Rising production
costs have already driven the
studios out of the United States
when filming large cast pictures,
and the trend toward the low
budget or medium budget films
like "Easy Rider" could make
"Waterloo" and films of its genre
as rare as "Ben Hur" and others.
Paramount is probably holding
its breath, hoping its picture sells.
Films like "Hello Dolly" and
"Star," high budget flicks, have
brought other studios to their
knees. The failure of this film
could mean the epic has met its
Waterloo.
