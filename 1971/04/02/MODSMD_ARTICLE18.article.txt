# '71 Superheroes! Zap! Bam! Pow! Relevancy?
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
A yellow taxi cab pulls up in
front of a "homey" rooming
house in College town. A boy
steps out with two suitcases and a
blue sport jacket flung over his
shoulders.
But wait! Doesn't his face look
familiar? Why .. . Why it's Dick
Grayson! Wow, what a mindblow!
But who's Dick Grayson?
I'll bet some of you recognized
the name immediately. But most
of you can't be too bright (you're
reading this article), so I'll have to

tell you who he is.
Dick Grayson is none other
than Batman's sidekick, Robin,
when he's not in his green
hotpants and little green slippers
with wings on them.
But what's Dick doing at
college?
For that matter, what are we
doing at college?
But back to the story.
As it turns out, "In typical
seventies style, Batman and Robin
have had a generation gap parting
of ways."

Holy relevancy!
"No longer content to be away
from where it's at, Dick Grayson
is an active university student,
who as Robin, makes sure
everything is cool on campus."
Holy Cosmic bummer!
But worse than that, not only
have Batman and Robin tried to
become relevant, but the Green
Lantern in several episodes has
dealt with poverty in Appalachia,
overpopulation, and slum
landlording.
Batman recently dealt with
some frustrated teen rebels in the
ghetto.
D.C. comics "Tomahawk"
magazine no longer has the
Indians lose all the time.
Well, now you know why it's
been so long since you've looked
at a comic book.
What's going to happen next?
Beetle Bailey getting sentenced
to life at hard labor for
slaughtering Vietnamese villagers?
Little Orphan Annie getting
VD?
In its search for relevance,
however, there are still two areas
that are no-nos for D.C.
comics—war and drugs.
The comic book code bans
discussion of drugs.
As for comic books dealing
with war, Carmine Infantino, D.C.
comics editorial director, explains
the avoidance of war in D.C.
comics with the very astute
observation that "People have an
aversion to war."

That's funny. I always thought
that Vietnam was the fun capital
of Asia.
But what's happened to Robin
back at the campus?
Well, there's been a student
strike. But because D.C. comics
doesn't discuss war, it's a fairly
unusual student strike because no
one can figure out why it's being
called.
On the steps of the registration
office a dude with long black hair
in front of the door is saying,
"Fellow students . . . we're closing
this 'Establishment' institute of
'Learning' . . . un
quote. . . down... until .. ."
Just like the way Lenny Siegel
talks.
Well, it turns out that among
the rads blocking the door are
none other than Jonah Ramm and
"Fire brand Fran."
They tell Dean Lewis that he
can bring in the national guard if
he wants to, but they ain't
moving.
Dean Lewis says that he won't

bring in the pigs, though, and
provoke campus violence.
Right on Dean Lewis!
But just at this point the cops
show, call everybody pinko punks
and start busting heads.
"Fire brand Fran" tries to call
a cop a pig and gets her face
shoved in. Robin tries to intercede
and with incredible dexterity
manages to get busted himself.
Meanwhile, back in Gotham
City, Bruce Wayne [Batman] and
his servant Alf are reading all
about this in a letter from Robin
and needless to say, are pretty
bummed out.
But Dick Grayson meanwhile
notices a vehicle inspection sticker
on the car he's being busted in!
There aren't vehicle inspection
stickers on police cars in the state!
Holy imposters! These are fake
cops hired by the rads to provoke
violence on the campus.
Holy what's going to happen?!
Unfortunately I wasn't able to
locate the next issue of the comic
so I really don't know.
You can run on down to Mac's

smoke shop in Palo Alto and get
the next issue of Batman. But you
still won't find out what happens
because the above story was from
a December issue.
This month's story is just as
bad however. Robin falls in love
with a computer date who's a
plastic dolly named Terri
Bergstrom. Robin also gets
mugged by some thiefs from the
Beta Zeta fraternity who all wear
orange tennis shoes.
Why do they all wear orange
tennis shoes? Buy the comic and
you still won't be able to find out.

Just like the way Lenny Siegel
talks.
Well, it turns out that among
the rads blocking the door are
none other than Jonah Ramm and
"Fire brand Fran."
They tell Dean Lewis that he
can bring in the national guard if
he wants to, but they ain't
moving.
Dean Lewis says that he won't

bring in the pigs, though, and
provoke campus violence.
Right on Dean Lewis!
But just at this point the cops
show, call everybody pinko punks
and start busting heads.
"Fire brand Fran" tries to call
a cop a pig and gets her face
shoved in. Robin tries to intercede
and with incredible dexterity
manages to get busted himself.
Meanwhile, back in Gotham
City, Bruce Wayne [Batman] and
his servant Alf are reading all
about this in a letter from Robin
and needless to say, are pretty
bummed out.
But Dick Grayson meanwhile
notices a vehicle inspection sticker
on the car he's being busted in!
There aren't vehicle inspection
stickers on police cars in the state!
Holy imposters! These are fake
cops hired by the rads to provoke
violence on the campus.
Holy what's going to happen?!
Unfortunately I wasn't able to
locate the next issue of the comic
so I really don't know.
You can run on down to Mac's

smoke shop in Palo Alto and get
the next issue of Batman. But you
still won't find out what happens
because the above story was from
a December issue.
This month's story is just as
bad however. Robin falls in love
with a computer date who's a
plastic dolly named Terri
Bergstrom. Robin also gets
mugged by some thiefs from the
Beta Zeta fraternity who all wear
orange tennis shoes.
Why do they all wear orange
tennis shoes? Buy the comic and
you still won't be able to find out.


A yellow taxi cab pulls up in
front of a "homey" rooming
house in College town. A boy
steps out with two suitcases and a
blue sport jacket flung over his
shoulders.
But wait! Doesn't his face look
familiar? Why .. . Why it's Dick
Grayson! Wow, what a mindblow!
But who's Dick Grayson?
I'll bet some of you recognized
the name immediately. But most
of you can't be too bright (you're
reading this article), so I'll have to

tell you who he is.
Dick Grayson is none other
than Batman's sidekick, Robin,
when he's not in his green
hotpants and little green slippers
with wings on them.
But what's Dick doing at
college?
For that matter, what are we
doing at college?
But back to the story.
As it turns out, "In typical
seventies style, Batman and Robin
have had a generation gap parting
of ways."

Holy relevancy!
"No longer content to be away
from where it's at, Dick Grayson
is an active university student,
who as Robin, makes sure
everything is cool on campus."
Holy Cosmic bummer!
But worse than that, not only
have Batman and Robin tried to
become relevant, but the Green
Lantern in several episodes has
dealt with poverty in Appalachia,
overpopulation, and slum
landlording.
Batman recently dealt with
some frustrated teen rebels in the
ghetto.
D.C. comics "Tomahawk"
magazine no longer has the
Indians lose all the time.
Well, now you know why it's
been so long since you've looked
at a comic book.
What's going to happen next?
Beetle Bailey getting sentenced
to life at hard labor for
slaughtering Vietnamese villagers?
Little Orphan Annie getting
VD?
In its search for relevance,
however, there are still two areas
that are no-nos for D.C.
comics—war and drugs.
The comic book code bans
discussion of drugs.
As for comic books dealing
with war, Carmine Infantino, D.C.
comics editorial director, explains
the avoidance of war in D.C.
comics with the very astute
observation that "People have an
aversion to war."

That's funny. I always thought
that Vietnam was the fun capital
of Asia.
But what's happened to Robin
back at the campus?
Well, there's been a student
strike. But because D.C. comics
doesn't discuss war, it's a fairly
unusual student strike because no
one can figure out why it's being
called.
On the steps of the registration
office a dude with long black hair
in front of the door is saying,
"Fellow students . . . we're closing
