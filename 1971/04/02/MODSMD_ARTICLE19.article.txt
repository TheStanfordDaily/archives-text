"Radical Chic & Mau-Mauing
the Flak Catchers" consists of two
long, probing essays on how
certain people on different coasts
and in different tax brackets
spend their time.
"Radical Chic," which first
appeared in the June, 1970
edition of "New York" magazine,
is Tom Wolfe's account of the
controversial party which Leonard
and Felicia Bernstein hosted for
the Black Panthers last spring in
their Park Avenue duplex.
"Radical Chic" becomes less a
chronicle of the "Beautiful
People" and more a vehicle for
social theory when Wolfe starts
expounding on "nostalgie de la
boue," nineteenth century French
term that means literally,
"nostalgia for the mud."
" 'Nostalgie de la boue' tends to
be a favorite motive whenever a
great many new faces and a lot of
new money enter Society. New
arrivals have always had two ways
of certifying their superiority over
the hated 'middle class.' They can
take on the trappings of
aristocracy, such as grand
architecture, servants, parterre
boxes, and high protocol; and
they can indulge in the gauche
thrill of taking on certain styles of
the lower orders."
Wolfe goes on to unmask the
cheeky sincerity of those who
sponsor causes as well as those
who initiate them.
Wolfe includes an editorial
from the "New York Times"
which runs, in part, "In contrast,
the group therapy plus
fund-raising soiree at the home of
Leonard Bernstein, as reported in
this newspaper yesterday,
represents the sort of elegant
slumming that degrades patrons
and patronized alike."
The "Times" editorial proved
the "coup de grace" which
signaled a curtailment to parties
such as those given by
Assemblyman Andrew Stein and
Carter and Amanda Burden for
Chavez's grape boycott, Jean
vanden Heuvel's for "Ramparts,"
Andrew Stein's for Bernadette
Devlin, Random House publisher
Richard Baron and Leonard
Bernstein's for the Panthers,
among others.
In "Mau-Mauing the Flak

Catchers," Wolfe turns to unmask
the artists of
confrontation."Mau-mauing" is
the term the militants use to
describe their confrontation
tactics with Bureaucracy, he says.
Those who catch flak are the
bureaucrats.
Unlike "Radical Chic," which
was set primarily on Manhattan's
East Side, "Mau-Mauing the Flak
Catchers" is set entirely in San
Francisco. Wolfe describes
confrontations between the
Mission Rebels, the Youth for the
Future, the New Thang and the
catchers of flak, including Mayor
Alioto, himself.

Wolfe's treatment of divergent
life-styles and status is
uncommonly keen. Not content
dealing solely with East Side
patricians, Wolfe travels to the
ghetto to discover their
counterparts.
In "Mau-Mauing the Flak
Catchers," we read that "the pimp
is the aristocrat of the street
hustle." Wolfe's analysis of the
righteous "pimp style" is as
devastatingly funny as his analysis
of the New York co-op dweller.
"Radical Chic" and "Mau-Mauing
the Flak Catchers" is first and last
great fun, and when did you last
have fun reading?
