# Boycott Continues
## Bomb Threat At Union 
### 
The ongoing boycott of Tresidder
Union yesterday was highlighted by a
midday bomb threat and a brief
shouting match involving food service
director and United Stanford
Employees' (USE) Jim Berk. The
coalition of Blacks, workers, and
students arrived before dawn at 4 a.m.
to begin a long day of picketing,
marching, and milling about the
complex.
Calm prevailed as non-violent tactics
continued and the alternative food
service again sold its boycott special
sandwiches, donuts, and coffee. Inside
a glass entrance door a freshly-installed
sign announced that the price of
hamburgers had gone down 10 cents,
indicating that the three-day old
boycott's economic pinch was being
felt.
At 12:45 a bullhorn-bearing
plainclothes policeman ordered the
throng around the terrace, and those
eating or working inside, to evacuate
Stanford's cultural center. An
unidentified caller had alerted the Daily
office that "a surprise was scheduled to
explode at the Union."
The disturbance catalysed the
creation of a crowd of about a
hundred. A USE spokesman spoke
from a tabletop, "I'd like to see a lot
more courage from the workers. Let's
put pressure on [President Richard]
Lyman and the whole administration to
dip into the reserve funds and restore
those laid off to their jobs."

An unidentified female student
worker in a yellow apron then came
forward, claiming, "The workers don't
support the boycott because they are
afraid. They don't want to talk to
people in groups; they are afraid
Tresidder may be shut down and their
jobs will be lost."
Berk rose and rebutted these
charges, mentioning that USE, initiator
of the action, "is run collectively by
working people. We are not calling a
strike at this moment because we are in
the middle of negotiations with the
National Labor Relations Board."
Then, the bearded Berk and the
burly Harrington, several feet apart at
this time, exchanged barbs.
"Are you tired of raving?"
Harrington shouted.
"Why did you attack a member of
the picket line yesterday?" Berk
countered, referring to the Wednesday
scuffle involving Michael Holman.
"He attacked me, he jumped on
me," fumed Harrington, "I'm not
about to jump on a guy with a broken
leg."
Berk turned away, and concluded,
"I'd like to ask the support of USE to
branch out and hit Encina Commons
tomorrow at noon." Mild applause
followed and pledges to further arouse
the community ensued. The crowd
dissipated, leaving the pickets behind,
some going to greet Bruce Franklin
outside Building 10.
