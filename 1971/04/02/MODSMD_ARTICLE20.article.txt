## Air Force Lands Tomorrow 
### TOM QUINN 
In the aftermath of their astounding
tournament championship at Riverside, Stanford's
Indians will be hosting the Air Force Academy this
Saturday for a doubleheader beginning at noon.
The contest should offer the team an opportunity
to add two more wins to its 19-10-1 record.
The cadets have enjoyed fluctuating reputation
so far this season. Air Force was supposed to be a
dominating force at Riverside, but fell flat on their
faces. One of the Falcons' losses was a 14-4
shellacking by Stanford in which pitchers Bruce
Shoen and Bob DiPietro fanned 22 Air Force
batsmen.
Coach Ray Young is confident of the Indians'
future success in both the PAC-8 and NCAA
competition after the Riverside championship.
Young noted, "A team doesn't often get the
opportunity to play in a tournament which had a
field including national power Arizona State and
Big Eight contenders Kansas State and Oklahoma.
"Beating some of the best teams to be found

should serve as a takeoff point for the team. We
have a very young team, but the team proved that
it can take on the best and come out on top.
After the championship on Saturday the team
suffered a letdown on Tuesday against Santa Clara
in a game that Young wishes he'd never scheduled.
After a tiring car ride back from Riverside and
registration on Monday, the team offered only
token resistance to the Broncos and consequently
got walloped, 13-4.
Fortunately, Wednesday's game against Cal
State Hayward was a totally different story.
Freshman Bob DiPietro hurled his way to his first
victory of this year as the Stanford club
dominated the whole game, 6-2.
Stanford's bats awoke from Tuesday's
dormancy in the third inning when second
baseman Dave Edson singled home A 1 O'Brien for
the first run of the game and Tom Williams
followed with a two-run home run which gave the
Indians a 3-0 lead.
