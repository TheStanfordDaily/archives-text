# Tough Meet Expected
## Trackmen Challenge Oregon 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The Stanford track team, off
to its finest start in recent years,
will challenge the perenially
talented Oregon Ducks in Eugene
this Saturday afternoon.
Coach Bill Bowerman's strong

Oregon contingent has a 2-0
record to date, their latest
triumph a 118-36 humiliation of
San Diego State. The Indians are
sporting a fine 3-0 record, having
defeated Fresno State, Occidental,
and San Jose State.

The Webfoots, as in past years,
have talent and depth in virtually
every event. They led by
sophomore Steve Prefontaine, the
current NCAA Cross Country
Champion who has a lifetime best
of 3:57.4 in the mile and an
8:33.2 two-mile.
Though the Tribe has lost the
last ten contests with Oregon
Saturday's meet may be a repeat
of the Stanford-San Jose State
confrontation, which went down
to the final event, the mile relay.
Oregon, however, will challenge
the Indians in every distance
event, where Stanford has its
strength.
Stanford finished only third in
last Saturday's Santa Barbara
Easter Relays, but a let-down
seemed inevitable after their
convincing upset of San Jose
State.
Coach Payton Jordan was
blunt about the Oregon Meet.
"We didn't take the Easter Relays
too seriously, and I'm afraid it
showed. This weekend we will be
meeting one of the best teams in
the country, and we will have to
be at our best in every event."
One encouraging note is that
Coach Jordan's entire discus crew
improved their individual marks in
the Easter Relays. Steve Davis
moved from 164-0 to 168-8, while
Pete Dreissigacker improved to
163-4 %. Davis has a lifetime best
of 182-6 and will be chasing
Oregon's Gary Wolf who has a
1971 best of 175-6.
Sophomore Rick Geisler ran a
lifetime mark of 4:10.0 to win the
Easter Relays mile over teammate
Arvid Kretz. Kretz is expected to
compete in the 3-mile, however.
