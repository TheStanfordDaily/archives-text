## Netmen Face USC, UCLA 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's varsity netters carry
their 6-0 season log to Los
Angeles this weekend for its first
showdown with two of the top
tennis teams in the collegiate
ranks, USC on Friday and UCLA
on Saturday.
"UCLA is unquestionably
considered the number one team
in the country right now," Coach
Dick Gould Said earlier this week.
"Trinity would probably be rated
second, with USC, Rice and
ourselves all fighting for number
three."
UCLA proved their top rating
last week by dumping
second-rated Trinity, 8-1. The
Bruins are led by defending
NCAA singles champ Jeff
Borowiak, Pakistani Davis Cupper

Haroon Rahim, and the brothers
Kreiss, Mike and Bob.
"They have the same team as
last year, plus the addition of
Jimmy Connors. Last week, he
[Connors] played in a four-man
tournament with Pancho Segura,
Pancho Gonzales, and Alex
Olmedo. And won it," Gould
explained.
The team is so strong and so
deep that Tito Vasquez and Elio
Alvarez, defending National Clay
Court Doubles Champs, are fourth

on the Uclans' doubles ladder.
USC promises to be tough
again this year too. After three
narrow defeats at the Trojans'
hands last year (6-3, 5-4, 5-4), the
Indians will meet virtually the
same line-up with only one
change. Eric Van Dillen turned
pro and left SC's top spot open.
Taking over number one will be
Tom Leonard, ranked above
Roscoe Tanner nationally, and
added to the squad is Mexican
Davis Cup ace Marcello Lara.
