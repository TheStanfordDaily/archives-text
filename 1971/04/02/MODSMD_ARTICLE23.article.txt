# Rochell Qualifies
## 
### 
Stanford's lone qualifier for
this weekend's NCAA Gymnastics
Championships was senior Steve
Rochell. Rochell, of Chicago, is
no stranger to the NCAA's still
rings competition. In 1969, Steve
finished 11th in the national
collegiates. Last year, he climbed
to fifth.
Stanford coach Dan Millman
believes Rochell could finish as
high as third this year. In Pac-8
competition last weekend,
Stanford finished seventh in team
points and Rochell captured a
third in the rings.
