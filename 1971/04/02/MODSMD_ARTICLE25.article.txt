Franklin Speaks
Suspended English professor H.
Bruce Franklin held what was termed
an "information gathering session"
outside President Lyman's office
yesterday afternoon, speaking to a
crowd of 150 supporters.
Franklin has been banned from
campus for the duration of his
suspension accept for periods from
1:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m. when he is allowed
on for the sole purpose of gathering
evidence in preparation of his defense
before the Academic Review Board.
Franklin spoke yesterday, calling
convicted Lieutenant William Calley "a
scapegoat of US imperialism," and
mentioned that he considered Henry
Cabot Lodge the implementor of the
strategy for the My Lai massacre. He
then asked questions of those present,
being careful not to stray far from the
subject of his own case.
Supporters have called for a picket
line outside this afternoon's Academic
Council meeting in the Physics Tank at
4:15 p.m. The English Review Club, a
group made up of graduate students in

the English department circulated a
petition in support of Franklin's
re-instatement.
Wyman Appointed
Willard G. Wyman, special assistant
to the president at Stanford University,
has been named dean of students at
Colby College in Waterfield, Maine.
Wyman received his master's degree in
English literature from Stanford in
1962 and his Ph.D. in 1969. As a
faculty member and administrator at
Stanford he was a teaching assistant
and instructor in English from
1961-1962. For two years he was an
associate dean of students.
In addition to administrative duties
at Colby, Wyman, as an associate
professor, will teach in the English
Department.
Aid To Colleges
Congress now is well aware of the
fiscal plight of the nation's colleges and
probably will seek to aid them through
some kind of institutional grant
formula, President Richard Lyman told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
He, however, expressed concern
with the formula approach and said
that the University prefers student aid
and cost of education allowances
imilar to the World War II GI Bill.

"If the bulk of federal support goes
to institutions through a single formula
under a single administrative agency,
then the urge to insist on
accountability through various kinds of
intervention and control will prove
irresistable over time," he warned.
"We have for several years tried to
promote the idea that the best form of
across-the-board federal assistance
would be aid to students, accompanied
by cost of education allowances to the
institutions they choose to attend.
"This would encourage efforts at
high educational quality, because
students would be voting with their
feet. It would discourage, although
obviously not make impossible, the
imposition of controls from the federal
government.
"But it doesn't seem likely that any
such proposal is going to get much of a
hearing."
Endorsed by the Carnegie
Commission in 1968 and again last
year, this approach was described as
offering "intelligent and very useful
help" by Stanford Vice President
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson in the
University's financial report for 1970.
In an extensive discussion of
university relations with the federal
government, published in his 1969
report, Cuthbertson said: "An
appropriate level of funding would
allow all college students, both

undergraduate and graduate, with
demonstrated need, the assurance of
some financial aid to meet expenses at
the institutions which they select.
Adequate scholarships to individual
students allow both an important
freedom of choice for the student and a
healthy competition and pluralism in
higher education."
Noting that this approach had
proven highly successful in the GI Bill,
Cuthbertson said: "The healthy
competition for federally supported
students will sharpen the quality and
effectiveness of educational
institutions. At the same time, society
will benefit from the national talent
which is otherwise lost because of the
financial barriers to higher education."
Arnett To Speak
Republican State Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett will speak tonight in the
Tresidder Union large lounge at 8:00
p.m. He will discuss Pete McCloskey,
the prospect of a "southern span," and
the governor's welfare program.

hearing."
Endorsed by the Carnegie
Commission in 1968 and again last
year, this approach was described as
offering "intelligent and very useful
help" by Stanford Vice President
Kenneth M. Cuthbertson in the
University's financial report for 1970.
In an extensive discussion of
university relations with the federal
government, published in his 1969
report, Cuthbertson said: "An
appropriate level of funding would
allow all college students, both

undergraduate and graduate, with
demonstrated need, the assurance of
some financial aid to meet expenses at
the institutions which they select.
Adequate scholarships to individual
students allow both an important
freedom of choice for the student and a
healthy competition and pluralism in
higher education."
Noting that this approach had
proven highly successful in the GI Bill,
Cuthbertson said: "The healthy
competition for federally supported
students will sharpen the quality and
effectiveness of educational
institutions. At the same time, society
will benefit from the national talent
which is otherwise lost because of the
financial barriers to higher education."
Arnett To Speak
Republican State Assemblyman Dixon
Arnett will speak tonight in the
Tresidder Union large lounge at 8:00
p.m. He will discuss Pete McCloskey,
the prospect of a "southern span," and
the governor's welfare program.
Franklin Speaks
Suspended English professor H.
Bruce Franklin held what was termed
an "information gathering session"
outside President Lyman's office
yesterday afternoon, speaking to a
crowd of 150 supporters.
Franklin has been banned from
campus for the duration of his
suspension accept for periods from
1:00 p.m.-6:00 p.m. when he is allowed
on for the sole purpose of gathering
evidence in preparation of his defense
before the Academic Review Board.
Franklin spoke yesterday, calling
convicted Lieutenant William Calley "a
scapegoat of US imperialism," and
mentioned that he considered Henry
Cabot Lodge the implementor of the
strategy for the My Lai massacre. He
then asked questions of those present,
being careful not to stray far from the
subject of his own case.
Supporters have called for a picket
line outside this afternoon's Academic
Council meeting in the Physics Tank at
4:15 p.m. The English Review Club, a
group made up of graduate students in

the English department circulated a
petition in support of Franklin's
re-instatement.
Wyman Appointed
Willard G. Wyman, special assistant
to the president at Stanford University,
has been named dean of students at
Colby College in Waterfield, Maine.
Wyman received his master's degree in
English literature from Stanford in
1962 and his Ph.D. in 1969. As a
faculty member and administrator at
Stanford he was a teaching assistant
and instructor in English from
1961-1962. For two years he was an
associate dean of students.
In addition to administrative duties
at Colby, Wyman, as an associate
professor, will teach in the English
Department.
Aid To Colleges
Congress now is well aware of the
fiscal plight of the nation's colleges and
probably will seek to aid them through
some kind of institutional grant
formula, President Richard Lyman told
the Faculty Senate yesterday.
He, however, expressed concern
with the formula approach and said
that the University prefers student aid
and cost of education allowances
imilar to the World War II GI Bill.

"If the bulk of federal support goes
to institutions through a single formula
under a single administrative agency,
then the urge to insist on
accountability through various kinds of
intervention and control will prove
irresistable over time," he warned.
"We have for several years tried to
promote the idea that the best form of
across-the-board federal assistance
would be aid to students, accompanied
by cost of education allowances to the
institutions they choose to attend.
"This would encourage efforts at
high educational quality, because
students would be voting with their
feet. It would discourage, although
obviously not make impossible, the
imposition of controls from the federal
government.
"But it doesn't seem likely that any
such proposal is going to get much of a
hearing."
