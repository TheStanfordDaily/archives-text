# Election Controversy
## McHenry's Conduct Questioned 
### DAN BERNSTEIN News Analysis 
During the final meeting of last
year's Student Senate, former Black
Students Union (BSU) chairman Leo
Bazile introduced the then freshman
Doug McHenry as the next president of
the Stanford student body. Today, on
the eve of the election campaign,
McHenry is indeed the front-runner for
the office.
His rise to the brink of the
presidency has largely been channeled
through the Student Senate, where, this
year, he has served as floor manager for
the black contingent of the 40-member
body. McHenry disavows any
vote-getting influence over Senate
members, and says that he is at once
"flattered, honored and suspicious" of
people who attribute that power to
him.
But the sophomore presidential
hopeful has been termed by Pat C. Shea
of the Council of Presidents as "a sharp
guy who plays all sides against the
middle—he knows how to get things
done in the Senate." To have any
degree of political success in the
Senate, any senator must possess a
considerable measure of political
acumen. McHenry has been generally
acknowledged as a deft politician, but
in two instances, serious questions
about his political, if not his personal
integrity have been raised.
The first incident occurred last
spring, when Jan Westfall, who had
served as election commissioner for the
last presidential election, was seeking
the Senate's reappointment to the post.
According to Shea, "Doug McHenry
got up at the meeting, and said that Jan
Westfall did a poor job, and that
someone more responsible was needed
to run the elections. He recommended
Chris Banks for the post.

"There were no facts behind
McHenry's slur," Shea continued. "It
was a case of sour grapes."
No Facts
Westfall echoed Shea's account. "He
had no facts to back up his charges of
incompetence or crookedness. Just ask
John and Bill [commonly known as
Shoch and Evers- the ticket which
opposed Shea, Grant, Mickelson and
Levin last spring] and they'll tell you
they got a fair election.
"He [McHenry] apologized to me
this spring when he wanted Louis
Humphrey (the current election
commissioner) to get some help. He
admitted he made the charges up.
McHenry made those charges because
he wanted to get a black [Banks] in
and to discredit Shea and Grant's
victory."
Herb Borock, a left-liberal, and the
Senate parliamentarian, also remembers
McHenry's charge and recalls that "no
evidence was presented."
Westfall Defeated
Jan Westfall's subsequent defeat in
her bid for re-appointment may or may
not have been directly linked to
McHenry's erroneous charges. But the
point is that such charges were made,
and although he later admitted their
falsity, McHenry has still failed to
formally retract his allegations.
In the aftermath of the Senate
spectacle, Chris Banks became the
election commissioner. His first and
only task was to conduct last fall's
Senate elections. After the first ballots
were declared invalid because of their
unreadability, Banks went to Westfall
for help. The election was conducted in
a flurry of controversy, and the results
were held up for over a month.
Last winter, a few weeks before the
quarter's final Senate meeting, Chris
Banks resigned. According to Shea, a

tentative deal was made between the
Council and the blacks in which Grant
would select the new commissioner.
However, McHenry denies that such a
deal was ever made.
Final Senate Meeting
On the day of the final Senate
meeting, Grant was prepared to submit
the name of Diane Wyble, a junior who
had worked closely with Westfall in last
spring's election. But her name never
made it to the Senate floor. Sometime
before the Senate convened, Wyble's
bid was killed and Louis Humphrey, a
former member of the Committee on
Nominations, whose reputation for
fairness and impartiality was looked
upon favorably from all sides of the
Senate's politically diverse spectrum,
became the new commissioner.
The rejection of Grant's nominee
merely lengthens the chronicle of
frustration that the Council of
Presidents has recorded this year. But
the process through which Humphrey
was chosen over Wyble demands some
closer examination.
McHenry flatly asserts that "because
I'm running for president, I was trying
to stay out of it [the selection of the
election commissioner]."
When asked if he played a leading
role in Humphrey's selection, McHenry
replied, "I'd like to think that I had
that much power. I'm flattered."
"But in many ways," he continued,
"it would have been better to have a
white commissioner because if
something goes wrong with the
election, the racist minds on campus
will charge Louis and me with
conspiracy."
Humphrey for Commissioner
McHenry said that although he'd
heard about it earlier, Humphrey's
intention to seek the commissionership
came up again in a black-Third World
caucus shortly before the Senate
convened.
"Black people are concerned about
student government," McHenry
explained, "and when Louis said he
wanted to run for elections
commissioner I decided to vote for him
even though a white commissioner
would have looked better since 1 was
running for president."
However, both Shea and Grant insist
that McHenry's involvement in
Humphrey's nomination was not that
distant.
"Before every Senate meeting,"
Shea explained, "the Council of
Presidents meets with the black floor
manager [McHenry] and the chairman
of the Senate |Mike Dawson) to
discuss the upcoming business, and to
see if we'll have trouble getting the
necessary votes.

"On this particular day,"he
continued, "McHenry, Dawson, Grant
and I met in my office, and when Grant
said that he was going to nominate
Diane Wyble for election commissioner,
both McHenry and Dawson said 'no.'
They wanted Louis Humphrey. They
were looking for someone in the BSU
for election commissioner. We didn't
have the votes to stop them so we had
to agree."
Humphrey is Fair
"Humphrey is a fair individual,"
concluded Shea, "but if McHenry
wanted to be truly impartial, Diane was
the right candidate."
According to Wyble, "Doug wanted
Louis to be the commissioner, and he
wanted me, Pat [Shea], Bob [Grant]
and Bennett Collum [a senior who, like
Wyble, has had considerable experience
with Stanford elections] to help him
out."
But McHenry's wish was not to be.
Wyble and Cullum both refused to help
the inexperienced Humphrey with the
spring elections. "I'm personally fed up
with the whole thing," said Cullum.
"I'm tired of them playing politics with
the office of election commissioner."
McHenry also asked Westfall to aid
Humphrey, but she too refused. It was
at this point that he admitted the
falsity of his charges against Westfall.
But the former election commissioner
was adamant. "I helped them get out of
a fiasco this fall and that's another
reason why I'm not going to do it this
spring. Louis Humphrey is competent,
but it would behoove him to take
suggestions from those who are
experienced. But why should we give
him help? I don't really see why the
Student Senate has to keep playing
politics with this thing."
Widespread Alienation
Of the widespread alienation
resulting from the mechanics behind
Humphrey's appointment, Grant said
"McHen y has hurt too many people
by trying to play little Leo."
"If he's going to stab somebody,"
observed John Shoch, "McHenry
should learn to do it quick and clean."
Quite aside from the political
maneuvering—a commodity over which
McHenry can claim no monopoly—two
facts emerge from the battles over
election commissioners.
First, Doug McHenry falsely charged
Jan Westfall with, in her words,
"incompetence and crookedness" as he
put forth the name of Chris Banks for
the post of election commissioner last
spring. Second, McHenry played a
direct role in the eventual nomination
of Louis Humphrey, even though he
said he was "trying to stay out of it
because I am running for president."
