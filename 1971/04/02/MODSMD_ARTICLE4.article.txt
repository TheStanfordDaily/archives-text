# Ball Scores Viet War
## 
### BOB SLATTERY BILL EVERS 
Speaking on the U.S. involvement in
Vietnam, former Under-Secretary of
State and ambassador to the U.N.,
George Ball last night told a small
crowd at Gummings Art Auditorium
that "We have stayed too long, and
spent too much in blood and treasure.
We shouldn't have gotten in the first
place, so let's write this in un-happy
chapter off. There will be some
repercussions; we can live with them.
There will be some temporary losses,
but in the long term I think there are
also going to be advantages too for the
United States and for our relations with
the rest of the world."
A crowd of 250 listened to Ball
defend himself as "the devil's
advocate" of non-escalation in the
Kennedy and Johnson administrations.
The crowd found little to disagree with
in Ball's discussion of how "the U.S.
has got to learn to use its power much
more carefully than we have in the
past," and how the U.S. military
intervention in Asia "was a hasty,
ill-considered action."
Devoting the body of his speech to
"three of four places of danger that lie
near the centers of power," Ball
expressed doubt that "the era of Soviet

expansionism is past," citing "the
buildup of Soviet naval forces in the
Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean,
and the Soviet beachhead and bases in
the United Arab Republic." Further
trouble in the future was seen in a
"final, gloomy prognosis for Western
Europe: a generation of Germans no
longer feeling guilty over the Nazi
period and probes toward the east with
hopes of reuniting Germanyâ€”unless
Britain is able to act as an effective
countervailing power to the power of
West Germany."
A final source of doubt in foreign
affairs indicated by Ball was the case of
Japan, where "what has occurred is the
building of an institution that
resembles Western institutions, but
with essential differences."
Speaking with a Daily interviewer
earlier in the day, Ball indicted high
officials in the United States
government as "just as guilty as Galley"
and called the My Lai trials "a time for
an examination of conscience for the
American people."
"When you put young, rather
unformed, unconditioned men into a
situation where they feel a sense of
danger, they're likely to react in a
brutal way; and this is what Ihe Galley
case means."
