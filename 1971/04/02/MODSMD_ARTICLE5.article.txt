To criticize the behavior of a
front-running candidate is unpopular. When
that candidate happens to be a member of
a minority group, such criticism inevitably
takes on racist implications. But the
conduct of Doug McHenry, a candidate for
the ASSU presidency, lies well within the
scope of the peoples' right to know.
Firstly, we do not quarrel with
McHenry's drive to secure the election
commissionership for Chris Banks last
spring. But we take issue with the
unsubstantiated allegations of
"incompetence and crookedness" which he
made towards Jan Westfall.
It is certainly Westfall's right to demand
a public retraction of charges that were
publically made if in fact there are no facts
to back them up.

It is certainly within our rights as
constituents to demand more responsible
behavior from an elected representative,
and the man who may be elected our next
president.
Secondly, we call attention to
McHenry's direct role in the nomination of
the current election commissioner, simply
because he publically stated that since he
was running for president, he was "trying
to stay out of it." The inconsistency of
McHenry's words and actions transcends
the realm of politics and undermines his
credibility.
We call upon McHenry to answer these
charges to the satisfaction of the Stanford
student body if he is to remain a viable
presidential candidate.
