A STANFORD MAN AT MY LAI?
It is ironic that the trial of an
obscure lieutenant at Fort
Benning, Georgia would do more
to bring home the destruction
which the war in Vietnam has
done to the fabric of American
society than any other single
action. William Calley has been
found guilty of premeditated
murder; we who have not seen the
evidence can not acquit him of
this verdict. Yet many people
believe that Lt. Calley is not the
only one guilty. We also must
admit that it was we who
accepted this man into military
service, trained him, and
commissioned him. Then we sent
him into a situation which would
demand qualities of judgment,
sensitivity and intelligence of the
highest calibre. Thus if Calley is
guilty all of us too share in that
guilt.
However, the Calley trial brings
to light a significant challenge to
our society. Calley was a
volunteer who was able to enter
OCS and receive a commission
only because American men with
a liberal education from a four
year college did not enter the
service in sufficient numbers to
maintain the college-option policy
which the Army prefers to use.
The military should be a
reflection of the society of which
it is a part or it may no longer
obey the wishes of that society.

Would a Stanford man have
done differently at My LaiV
I think so. He would have
recognized the difference between
combat and murder, between
reaction and premeditation,
between obedience and
submission, and between
vengeance and tactical necessity.
The United States has more men
in college than any other nation in
the world. Yet, at the same time,
it finds it necessary to accept a
man who had flunked out of a
junior college and had no previous
military experience to lead a
platoon of men in Vietnam
We at Stanford must ask
ourselves why?

FOLLOWING ORDERS
(This is a letter sent to a local
draft board in Massachusetts.)
Dear Mrs. Astor,
I am registered with your local
board 108 and am due to have my
medical interview soon. In other
words, I am several steps away
from being formally inducted by
your board into the United States
Army to fight in Vietnam.
I have followed with
considerable concern the
court-martial of Liei"Â»nant
William Calley at Fort Benning,
Georgia. Three years ago,
Lieutenant Calley was in a similar
position to mine. His draft board
was getting ready to process him
for induction to fight in Vietnam,
only he chose instead to be

trained as an officer directly by
the Army.
From all I've been able to
determine, he's been a model
soldier throughout his military
career, and as recognition of this
fact, the High Command has
issued him several medals.
Lieutenant Calley has followed
orders explicitly because he has
believed that his leaders are right.
I believe that the tragedy at My
Lai happened because Lieutenant
Calley and his men followed
orders. They believed that their
leaders knew what they were
doing, and probably more
importantly, Lieutenant Calley
knew that if he did not follow
orders he might very probably be
court-martialed.
Because Lieutenant Calley
obediently responded to inhuman
orders from his commanders, he
almost lost his life by hanging; as
it is now, he is doomed to an
imprisoned life of hard labor.
What are young men today to
think when they may well be
faced with the same dilemma: if
they do not accept induction or
follow orders, they can be
imprisoned; if they do not
question all orders from superior
officers, they may be hanged for
war atrocities.
How am I to feel as I go
through my induction processing.
I would like your board to
make a comment to me about the
trial of Lieutenant William Calley.
Please recognize that this letter is
sent in good faith; I don't believe
in violent protest or angry letters.
But I do believe in patient
discussion of viewpoints when
these viewpoints directly
determine a man's destiny.
