## Protectors Of Youth 
### 
• donald I. stuedman

I have an eight year old son.
His eyes sparkle when he talks and
he exudes an enthusiasm for living
that gives everyone around him
great pleasure. I love my son more
than anything I can think of, and
when I think of him in terms of
Lodge's right to speak on the
justifications of making war, I
tense up considerably. Lodge and
people like him are today in the
process of justifying tomorrow's
wars. Unless I, and millions like
me, can muster the courage to do
something now, tomorrow they
will take my precious son, and
perhaps his life, In this light, the
Lodge issue becomes an incredible
sham. To all of the Lodges, I say
please stop before you kill my son
and the legions more like him.
My heritage has been that of a
right wing Republican who
earned, the hard way, a degree in
business. It isn't necessary for
anyone to review for me the rights
of free speech, law and order, and
all of the logic involved in what
will ultimately provide
reinforcement for preservation of
the established system. Such logic
is perfect for the short term, as we
well know; but would those of
you who are so up tight and
against the anti-war people please
tell me how your short term logic
will allow my son to have the
precious possession that most of
you have obviously already

acquired, when he reaches your
age?
Where Are The Parents?
Must it be pointed out that war
will go on unless we do something
to change existing conditions?
Today the only non-rhetorical
thing being done is by the young
who have so much to lose. Where
in the hell are all of the mothers
and all of the fathers of this
country, and why aren't they
doing something about it? Are
they afraid to argue with those
erudite scholars of the status quo
because such scholarly logic seems
so sound? Must the children
always suffer for their parents
ignorance? When will we see past
our immediate stupidity?
The war dead cannot give us
their opinion, and most of the
quick appear to be supporting the
system that allowed them to
survive. Are we that thankful for
our own lives? Those who have
yet to go through the ordeal of
soldiering are justifiably
apprehensive to the point of
rather facing the issue at home
than on a lonely battlefield where
no one will notice their violent
deaths.
They are a very courageous
band, and even though I was
trained to abhor trashing,
bombing, and burning, and want
it stopped, I cannot help but
realize that, so far, it appears to
be the only real hope we have of
polarizing the ambivalent. We all
know the physical things that are
damaged have nothing to do with
the war, and the money it takes to
make repairs is hard to come by.
But, the preclusion of the act may
also preclude the effectiveness of
the voice that cries, and I am
terribly torn between the two
causes.
Killing Off the Young
Do we really think that our
country's leaders are actively
pursuing the righteous road to
peace; or by killing off our most
precious young, that our country
will be better off because the
system must survive? Yet, one by
one, the protectors of freedom are
eliminating those who keep
ringing the bells in our dozing
conscience. God help us all!
If you cannot find it in your
heart to at least empathize and
support the young in an
affirmative anti-war movement, I
must accuse you of wanting to kill
my son. Should I make lightly of
that?

our own lives? Those who have
yet to go through the ordeal of
soldiering are justifiably
apprehensive to the point of
rather facing the issue at home
than on a lonely battlefield where
no one will notice their violent
deaths.
They are a very courageous
band, and even though I was
trained to abhor trashing,
bombing, and burning, and want
it stopped, I cannot help but
realize that, so far, it appears to
be the only real hope we have of
polarizing the ambivalent. We all
know the physical things that are
damaged have nothing to do with
the war, and the money it takes to
make repairs is hard to come by.

Killing Off the Young
Do we really think that our
country's leaders are actively
pursuing the righteous road to
peace; or by killing off our most
precious young, that our country
will be better off because the
system must survive? Yet, one by
one, the protectors of freedom are
eliminating those who keep
ringing the bells in our dozing
conscience. God help us all!
If you cannot find it in your
heart to at least empathize and
support the young in an
affirmative anti-war movement, I
must accuse you of wanting to kill
my son. Should I make lightly of
that?

I have an eight year old son.
His eyes sparkle when he talks and
he exudes an enthusiasm for living
that gives everyone around him
great pleasure. I love my son more
than anything I can think of, and
when I think of him in terms of
Lodge's right to speak on the
justifications of making war, I
tense up considerably. Lodge and
people like him are today in the
process of justifying tomorrow's
wars. Unless I, and millions like
me, can muster the courage to do
something now, tomorrow they
will take my precious son, and
perhaps his life, In this light, the
Lodge issue becomes an incredible
sham. To all of the Lodges, I say
please stop before you kill my son
and the legions more like him.
My heritage has been that of a
right wing Republican who
earned, the hard way, a degree in
business. It isn't necessary for
anyone to review for me the rights
of free speech, law and order, and
all of the logic involved in what
will ultimately provide
reinforcement for preservation of
the established system. Such logic
is perfect for the short term, as we
well know; but would those of
you who are so up tight and
against the anti-war people please
tell me how your short term logic
will allow my son to have the
precious possession that most of
you have obviously already

acquired, when he reaches your
age?
Where Are The Parents?
Must it be pointed out that war
will go on unless we do something
to change existing conditions?
Today the only non-rhetorical
thing being done is by the young
who have so much to lose. Where
in the hell are all of the mothers
and all of the fathers of this
country, and why aren't they
doing something about it? Are
they afraid to argue with those
erudite scholars of the status quo
because such scholarly logic seems
so sound? Must the children
always suffer for their parents
ignorance? When will we see past
our immediate stupidity?
The war dead cannot give us
their opinion, and most of the
quick appear to be supporting the
system that allowed them to
survive. Are we that thankful for
our own lives? Those who have
yet to go through the ordeal of
soldiering are justifiably
apprehensive to the point of
rather facing the issue at home
