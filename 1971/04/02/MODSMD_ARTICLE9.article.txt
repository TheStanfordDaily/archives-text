# Calley Released

(AP) â€” Lt. William L. Calley Jr.
walked out of the Ft. Benning,
Ga. Stockade last night, released
on the order of President Nixon
pending appeal of his conviction
for murder of at least 22 civilians
at My Lai.
The presidential action
forestalled any plan to transfer
Calley to the Army disciplinary
barracks at Ft. Leavenworth,
Kan., a move that had been
considered possible.
Asked if Calley would be under
guard, Presidential Press Secretary
Ronald Ziegler said he would be
guarded, "on the same basis as the
court martial." Restrictions were
placed on Calley's movements
during that time.
The same jury which handed
down the verdict sentenced him
Wednesday to life imprisonment
at hard labor.
The verdict and sentence
touched off a nationwide
groundswell of opposition in the
form of telegrams and letters of
protest, offers of money, and
plans for demonstrations. Ziegler
said that 25,000 telegrams had
been sent and were running 100:1
in favor of clemency.
Gov. Edgar D. Whitcomb of
Indiana, ordered all state flags
flown at half-staff to protest the
conviction and sentencing.
Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia
proclaimed April 5 "American
Fighting Men's Day" in the state
and urged residents to display the
flag and drive with headlights on.
He said he took the action
because Calley's conviction and
sentence have lowered the morale
of U.S. soldiers in Vietnam.
