ASSU BAIL BOND FUND
The ASSU has a BAIL FUND for use by Stanford I
students. Any student who desires bail through
this special fund should contact Edward Hayes, a
second year law student, by telephoning him at
491-3414 or by leaving a message at the ASSU
office. Contact can be made by the arrested stu
dent himself or by someone who has reason to be
lieve that a student may be in need of assistance.
As long as there is sufficient reserve in the FUND,
a student may borrow as much as he needs to
cover the bail costs as set by a judge or magistrate.
All the student need do is sign a note promising to
repay the loan in full. The loan is interest free for
the first week after issue.
The BAIL FUND is limited to use in Bay Area I
courts only. It is available to all currently regis
tered students although each student should at
temp to receive aid from relatives and friends first
in order that more students can have assistance
when they need it.
