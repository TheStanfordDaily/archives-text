# After 20 Months
## Harris Plea: 'Revolutionary Love' 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
David Harris, appearing with his wife
Joan Baez before an overflow crowd in
Memorial Church Saturday night, called
for daily struggle for "those things that
we understand as human good."
In this first public appearance since
being released 16 days earlier from
prison for draft resistance, Harris
refused to elaborate an ideology, but
favored "the possibility of engaging in a
process together."
He rejected armed struggle working
through the system and dropping out
of society, for the "one real alternative,
a revolutionary love."
Harris was warmly received by the
crowd of 240 0 which gave him three
standing ovations. His speech followed
Baez's performance of "Carry it on,"
theme song of a film she and Harris star
in.
Elaborating on his theme of
revolutionary love, Harris said, "the
alternative to a dehumanizing,
destructive society built upon the
principles of death is obviously, life.
The alternative to leading really a
vacuous, simple, enjoying life is to go
out of that life and reach other lives."
Lost Ideals
Stating that he had lost his ideals

during 20 months in prison, Harris
listed three political goals he believed
in. "We're for people sharing the
necessities for living... We are for
people making the decisions that affect
their lives. We realize that there is no
possibility of the coexistence of human
life and any military approaches
whatsoever."
Harris denounced American society
for "exploiting a man's life for the sake

of profit. .. manipulating and
controlling the lives of all the citizens
of the country, and having decided very
distinctly to build an empire of puppets
and slaves around the entire world." He
said these policies are being pursued in
"as bloody and as brutal way as we can
find in history."
Speaking about the war in
Indo-china, Harris condemned Nixon's
policies saying, "he doesn't want to get

out, he wants Americans out so that
everybody who dies has slant eyes."
NLF Struggle
Asked if he supported the armed
struggle of the National Liberation
Front, Harris replied, "If the purpose
of the NLF in Vietnam is the real
liberation of the human beings who live
in Vietnam, then I think the use of
armed struggle has definitely
undermined this purpose.
"I dig the NLF, but I think they
made a mistake. I'd say the same thing
about the Panthers .. . there ain't
nobody going to beat America at
violence.
"If the U.S. government decides that
Stanford University is the source of
trouble in its country, then it will
bomb the son of a bitch until Leland
Stanford turns over..."
Harris came down especially heavily
against electoral politics. "One of the
other alternatives has been to presume
that that system that has created
something like Vietnam, that system
which has built itself upon the burned
bodies of young children and finds
burning young children central to its
existence is somehow going to change if
you ask it... is somehow going to
change if you put a new man in the
drivers seat.
All prisoners are political prisoners,
according to Harris. "We've got to
understand that the act isn't a crime,
it's the situation that makes it a
crime ... I was in six jails and two
penitentiaries, and I never met one
person in one of those penitentiaries
that did something the congress don't
do every day.
"I met a lot of dudes in for
murder . . . but who should be in when
its part of our government policy. If
you go next door and steal a tape
recorder you're going to get ten years
in the Joint, if you go to Venezuela and
steal all the oil in the entire country
then you're going to make the cover of
Time magazine."
Reinstate Franklin
Speaking about a local issue, Harris
said he didn't think Associate Professor
H. Bruce Franklin should be fired, but
that Franklin's problem was "not one
of my higher political priorities."
"I don't want to see anybody fired.
I'd like to see a lot of people just get up
and leave this god damn place because I
think basically Stanford is a worthless
institution."
