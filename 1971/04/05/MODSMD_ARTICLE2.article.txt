# Students To Vote This Week For Officers, Referenda, Initiatives
## 
### CYNTHIA WASNEY 
Six presidential slates and 11
assorted initiatives, referenda and
amendments face student voters in
primary elections Wednesday and
Thursday April 7 and 8.
Candidates for ASSU president and
vice-president, respectively, are Chris
Hocker and Robin Friedman; Douglas
McHenry and Diane Fields; running as a
council with Ann Kimball and Larry
Diamond; Eric Plow and Bill Baker;
Douglas Single and Brian Hewitt; Mimi
Winslow and Tina Swent; and Barry
Whitesides and Gordon Bardett.
Candidates for senior class president,
vice-president and business manager
are, respectively, Frank Miller, Stacey
Fitzsimmons and Allan Wernick; Allen
Meredith, Claude Terry and Jack
Stevens.
In order to win, candidates must
receive a majority of votes cast.
Constitutional amendments must
receive 2/3 votes cast to pass, while all
other proposals need a majority. If no
candidate, or assessment proposal
receives a majority, a run off (final)
election will be held.
Referenda
Six of the various initives and
referenda are constitutionally binding if
passed. First is the ASSU program fee
proposal, which lists choices of student
assessment of 50,1,2,3 or 5 for each
quarter of the academic year '71 -'72.
A second is a reapportionment of
undergraduate constituencies in the
Senate. Under the present system,
outlined in Article 11, section 2 of the
constitution, undergraduate senators
are chosen by department (ex. English,
Sociology etc.). The amendment would
apportion representatives by residence
(Wilbur,-Branner, Stern, etc.)
A third proposal, which amends
Article V section 9, would allow
voluntary campus organizations who
raise their own funds to bank wherever
they like, instead of the present system
of mandatory banking with the ASSU.
A fourth such binding proposition is
a combination of a budget initiative
and a by-law amendment. The proposal
will be voted on as a whole, rather than
yes-no on the budget, and ves-no on
the by-law amendment.
Budget Proposal
The proposed '71-'72 budget
allocates the program fee (m
percentages) to various campus boards

and organizations. A change of this
budget over last year's is the
appropriation of 12 percent of each for
the BSU and MECHA. These two
organizations are the largest single
recipients of the proposed budget.
In the event that the program fee
voted upon is $0, the appropriations
will similarly be $0. (section 2). This
initiative stipulates that the
organizations which are allocated
money must itemize the dollar amount
of their appropriation, after being
informed of its total amount, in order
to receive Senate approval (sections 3,4
and 5).
The by-law amendment portion first
of all designates overseas campuses as
divisional student association and
therefore eligible for part of the 50
percent of ASSU funds which, under
the constitution, are allocated to
divisional student associations. Section
2 of the by-law amendment is designed
to prevent the Senate from spending
reserve funds without a referendum.
A fifth and sixth proposal concern
special assessments levied on each
student. One guarantees money to the
Daily the other guarantees money to
the Band for out-of-state trips.
Student Opinion
The remaining proposals are not
binding on the Senate or university
policy, but are statements of student
opinion. These proposals concern
corporate and military recruiting, the
war in Southeast Asia, General Motors
policy and the SCLC and SJC.
The recruiting proposal is a vote to
prohibit use of Stanford lands for
recruitment by the military and by
corporations "directly producing"
material and research for the military.
The first peace proposal expresses
support for withdrawal of U.S. military
personnel from S.E. Asia by the end of
this year. The other is a more detailed
peace treaty, with stipulations on U.S.
policy toward Vietnam.
A fourth proposal attempts to advise
trustees to vote Stanford shares of
General Motors stock to provide for:
—representation of GM employees
dealers and consumers on the Board of
Directors
—nominations to the GM Board
made by stockholders and
—information on GM minority
employment, pollution and auto safety
to be published in GM's annual report.

The last of these propositions
requests the Committee of Fifteen to
amend SCLC and SJC legislation to
guarantee that:
—rulings concerning student conduct
can only be decided and enforced by
student judicial panels or
student-faculty panels, if and only if
there is reciprocate power concerning
faculty conduct.
—individual rights outlined in the
U.S. constitution are upheld and
—the University president is limited
(under the revised Charter) to granting
amnesty and commuting sentences.
Polling places are located at the
Engineering Corner, the Post Office,
the Business School Lounge, the
Medical School Lounge, the Law
School Lounge, the Physics Tank, and
the Computation Center.
