# Return Of A Hero
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER Commentary 
David Harris received the welcome of a conquering hero on his return to
Stanford Saturday night. He seemed to be almost more than a man to the 2400
people in Memorial Church who rose from the pews and the floor to applaud him
as he stood, hunched — and slightly nervous, before the lectern.
Somehow, Harris is more than a hero to this generation of students. His
leadership in the Resistance, his marriage to a folksinger whose voice many
students have been familiar with since elementary school, his 20-month
incarceration, and his firm dedication to his beliefs and dreams have been so
widely publicized that he is close to being a cliche.
David Harris, inadvertently a hero and a near-legend, did not offer the answers
that people were waiting for. It seemed he could not, for he did not feel he had
them.
He may have disappointed Saturday's audience in not living up to this glorified
role as he rambled through his short address. And he may have sensed the
expectation on the part of his audience an expectation which he could not fulfill
without negating his own beliefs. "David Harris doesn't have all the answers," he
said, as he urged the assemblage to find their own.
Yet he did offer the broad outlines of his philosophy - the need for real human
dignity, the need for humans to control their own destinies, the need for a
cooperative effort in the building of a new society based on "revolutionary love."
The guidelines he offered, and the mere fact of his presence in Memorial
Church, may still have filled a real gap in the lives of those people here who have
felt progressively impotent, frustrated, and finally lethargic about changing a
society "rotten to its roots."
But one may wonder whether Harris filled that gap for a single night only, or
whether the effect of his return to campus will be a continuing rejuvenating and
resparking of the commitment of many who had been overcome by their own
inertia.
If this resparking is to take place, it probably will do so without further
appearance by Harris - even during his one-night appearance, he showed a distaste
for the University and what he sees as its delusions. His comparison of life at
Stanford with life in the penitentiary was telling to him, it is a place where one
relinquishes control of one's own life to others, and a place where one can
accomplish little toward the restructuring of society.
Even though he was distant from the life on this campus - and he said that he
was not yet sure the people crowded into Mem Chu were real - and even though
he gave no specific road for people to follow, only a direction, Harris was
nonetheless convincing. He was only a man, but he had the aura of an honest man,
and a dedicated man. He said that he had lost his ideals during his prison tenure,
but he offered something other than ideals - he offered the example of his own
beliefs.
He was no more than a man. But he was a man whom people grown callous
with disbelief could believe.

resparking of the commitment of many who had been overcome by their own
inertia.
If this resparking is to take place, it probably will do so without further
appearance by Harris - even during his one-night appearance, he showed a distaste
for the University and what he sees as its delusions. His comparison of life at
Stanford with life in the penitentiary was telling to him, it is a place where one
relinquishes control of one's own life to others, and a place where one can
accomplish little toward the restructuring of society.
Even though he was distant from the life on this campus - and he said that he
was not yet sure the people crowded into Mem Chu were real - and even though
he gave no specific road for people to follow, only a direction, Harris was
nonetheless convincing. He was only a man, but he had the aura of an honest man,
and a dedicated man. He said that he had lost his ideals during his prison tenure,
but he offered something other than ideals - he offered the example of his own
beliefs.
He was no more than a man. But he was a man whom people grown callous
with disbelief could believe.
David Harris received the welcome of a conquering hero on his return to
Stanford Saturday night. He seemed to be almost more than a man to the 2400
people in Memorial Church who rose from the pews and the floor to applaud him
as he stood, hunched — and slightly nervous, before the lectern.
Somehow, Harris is more than a hero to this generation of students. His
leadership in the Resistance, his marriage to a folksinger whose voice many
students have been familiar with since elementary school, his 20-month
incarceration, and his firm dedication to his beliefs and dreams have been so
widely publicized that he is close to being a cliche.
David Harris, inadvertently a hero and a near-legend, did not offer the answers
that people were waiting for. It seemed he could not, for he did not feel he had
them.
He may have disappointed Saturday's audience in not living up to this glorified
role as he rambled through his short address. And he may have sensed the
expectation on the part of his audience an expectation which he could not fulfill
without negating his own beliefs. "David Harris doesn't have all the answers," he
said, as he urged the assemblage to find their own.
Yet he did offer the broad outlines of his philosophy - the need for real human
dignity, the need for humans to control their own destinies, the need for a
cooperative effort in the building of a new society based on "revolutionary love."
The guidelines he offered, and the mere fact of his presence in Memorial
Church, may still have filled a real gap in the lives of those people here who have
felt progressively impotent, frustrated, and finally lethargic about changing a
society "rotten to its roots."
But one may wonder whether Harris filled that gap for a single night only, or
whether the effect of his return to campus will be a continuing rejuvenating and
resparking of the commitment of many who had been overcome by their own
inertia.
If this resparking is to take place, it probably will do so without further
appearance by Harris - even during his one-night appearance, he showed a distaste
for the University and what he sees as its delusions. His comparison of life at
Stanford with life in the penitentiary was telling to him, it is a place where one
