# McHenry Replies To Allegations
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Doug McHenry yesterday replied to charges made
in Friday's Daily, denying he called former election
commissioner Jan Westfall "crooked," and asserting
his efforts on behalf of current election commissioner
Louis Humphrey were in the context of his role as a
senator and Black Students Union (BSU) floor
manager. Westfall also said she didn't remember using
the word "crooked."
In an interview conducted in the Daily offices,
McHenry was asked to explain his role in the election
of Louis Humphrey.
"Perhaps the best way for me to clarify my
involvement in the selection of Louis Humphrey for
the post of election commissioner," he began, "would
be first to explain my role in the ASSU Senate."
"First of all, the Senate determines who the
election commissioner is going to be. So the first level
of my involvement is that I have a vote in selecting
the election commissioner.
"The second level of involvement," he continued,
"is that I'm also the floor manager for the BSU in the
ASSU Senate. My role as the floor manager is to meet
with the BSU caucus and to discuss the issues that
will come up in the Senate.
"The first time I ever heard that Louis Humphrey
was going to run for election commissioner was from
Mike Dawson, the chairman of the Senate. I heard
about it in the early afternoon of the day Humphrey
was elected."
When asked about his reaction to Humphrey's
desire to run, McHenry said, "The first thing I
thought of was: was there a possibility of a conflict
of interests? Not because it was my duty as a senator
to vote for a commissioner, but what effect a black
election commissioner would have on eliciting the
racism of the Stanford community.
White Commissioner
"On the one hand," he continued, "I thought in
many ways that it would be better since I was
running for president along with another black
student, that it would be more advantageous to have
a white elections commissioner. Because in the event
of any election irregularities - especially if we
happened to win the election - there would be no
racist charges from the Stanford community."
McHenry was then asked what conclusion he
reached about the possibility of a conflict of
in te rests.
"I concluded to follow my conscience," he
replied. My conscience meant that it. would be
equally racist for me not to vote for Louis Humphrey
mainly because he was black only for the reason that
I was afraid of the racist reaction of the community if
by some chance the elections did not go well."

McHenry said that during the afternoon of the day
Humphrey was elected, a meeting took place in the
office of Pat C. Shea. Shea, Bob Grant, Mike Dawson
and McHenry were present.
"We discussed a nomination to a nominations
committee, the upcoming budget, and whether a
particular senator ought to hold on to his seat. They
(Shea and (Jrant)brought up whether or not we
would support Bennett (Cullum) or (Diane) Wyble.
Dawson said that we support Louis Humphrey. I
may have said it, but Dawson did most of the
talking."
Meeting in Shea's Office
At that point, McHenry was asked why he didn't
say anything about the meeting in Shea's office
during the interview that was obtained for last
Friday's story.
"There was no conscious reason why," he replied.
"I didn't think it was important because of what we
talked about during that meeting. It really didn't even
register in my mind to make a choice whether to
mention it or not, especially since the issue of
election commissioner was a minor issue in the
meeting."
McHenry did not disqualify himself from the
position of floor manager because "in the case of
Louis Humphrey, it didn't make any difference. It
would have been a different thing if I'd personally
gone around and attempted to get votes for Louis in
the Senate. But I didn't do that."
McHenry answered a flat "no" when asked if he
made unsubstantiated allegations against Jan
Westfall. "The allegation is essentially that I said that
there were campaign irregularities under Jan
Westfall's commissionership that involved the fact
that at least one ticket spent a substantial amount
over the constitutionally allowed sum in a
presidential election."
It has been nearly a year since the allegations of
campaign irregularities have been made. Today is the
first time that any effort has been made to
substantiate them. In view of this, McHenry was
asked why he waited almost a year to explain the
allegations that were made against Westfall.
"On the one hand, I didn't think it meant that
much to her. I just didn't make any special efforts to
go find her to tell her the charges. The only time it
has been brought up is just during this election
commissioner thing. It wasn't like she was rapping on
my door asking what they (the charges) were."
Westfall's account differs from McHenry's. "It was
ten days after the Senate meeting last spring," she
said, "and I said 'Okay, Doug, I'd like to hear what
the specific violations were.' 11<* didn't sav anything.

He just gave me a bunch of garbage which didn't
mean anything."
McHenry denied that he ever called Westfall
"crooked." Technically, Chris Banks who replaced
Westfall as commissioner cited the alleged
irregularities in a speech to the Senate last spring. "He
(Banks) asked me for suggestions on what he should
say in his speech," recalled McHenry. "I told him to
tell them why he wanted the job, and that it had been
rumored that there were some campaign irregularities
under the Westfall commissionership.
$200 limit
"According to Loudin Beam (a candidate for
president last year)," McHenry continued, "his ticket
of Cory, Mattson and Beam spent at least $100 over
the authorized $200 limit.
When reached for comment, Cory acknowledged
