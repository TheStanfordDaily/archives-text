# McHenry Replies To Allegations
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Doug McHenry yesterday replied to charges made
in Friday's Daily, denying he called former election
commissioner Jan Westfall "crooked," and asserting
his efforts on behalf of current election commissioner
Louis Humphrey were in the context of his role as a
senator and Black Students Union (BSU) floor
manager. Westfall also said she didn't remember using
the word "crooked."
In an interview conducted in the Daily offices,
McHenry was asked to explain his role in the election
of Louis Humphrey.
"Perhaps the best way for me to clarify my
involvement in the selection of Louis Humphrey for
the post of election commissioner," he began, "would
be first to explain my role in the ASSU Senate."
"First of all, the Senate determines who the
election commissioner is going to be. So the first level
of my involvement is that I have a vote in selecting
the election commissioner.
"The second level of involvement," he continued,
"is that I'm also the floor manager for the BSU in the
ASSU Senate. My role as the floor manager is to meet
with the BSU caucus and to discuss the issues that
will come up in the Senate.
"The first time I ever heard that Louis Humphrey
was going to run for election commissioner was from
Mike Dawson, the chairman of the Senate. I heard
about it in the early afternoon of the day Humphrey
was elected."
When asked about his reaction to Humphrey's
desire to run, McHenry said, "The first thing I
thought of was: was there a possibility of a conflict
of interests? Not because it was my duty as a senator
to vote for a commissioner, but what effect a black
election commissioner would have on eliciting the
racism of the Stanford community.
White Commissioner
"On the one hand," he continued, "I thought in
many ways that it would be better since I was
running for president along with another black
student, that it would be more advantageous to have
a white elections commissioner. Because in the event
of any election irregularities - especially if we
happened to win the election - there would be no
racist charges from the Stanford community."
McHenry was then asked what conclusion he
reached about the possibility of a conflict of
in te rests.
"I concluded to follow my conscience," he
replied. My conscience meant that it. would be
equally racist for me not to vote for Louis Humphrey
mainly because he was black only for the reason that
I was afraid of the racist reaction of the community if
by some chance the elections did not go well."

McHenry said that during the afternoon of the day
Humphrey was elected, a meeting took place in the
office of Pat C. Shea. Shea, Bob Grant, Mike Dawson
and McHenry were present.
"We discussed a nomination to a nominations
committee, the upcoming budget, and whether a
particular senator ought to hold on to his seat. They
(Shea and (Jrant)brought up whether or not we
would support Bennett (Cullum) or (Diane) Wyble.
Dawson said that we support Louis Humphrey. I
may have said it, but Dawson did most of the
talking."
Meeting in Shea's Office
At that point, McHenry was asked why he didn't
say anything about the meeting in Shea's office
during the interview that was obtained for last
Friday's story.
"There was no conscious reason why," he replied.
"I didn't think it was important because of what we
talked about during that meeting. It really didn't even
register in my mind to make a choice whether to
mention it or not, especially since the issue of
election commissioner was a minor issue in the
meeting."
McHenry did not disqualify himself from the
position of floor manager because "in the case of
Louis Humphrey, it didn't make any difference. It
would have been a different thing if I'd personally
gone around and attempted to get votes for Louis in
the Senate. But I didn't do that."
McHenry answered a flat "no" when asked if he
made unsubstantiated allegations against Jan
Westfall. "The allegation is essentially that I said that
there were campaign irregularities under Jan
Westfall's commissionership that involved the fact
that at least one ticket spent a substantial amount
over the constitutionally allowed sum in a
presidential election."
It has been nearly a year since the allegations of
campaign irregularities have been made. Today is the
first time that any effort has been made to
substantiate them. In view of this, McHenry was
asked why he waited almost a year to explain the
allegations that were made against Westfall.
"On the one hand, I didn't think it meant that
much to her. I just didn't make any special efforts to
go find her to tell her the charges. The only time it
has been brought up is just during this election
commissioner thing. It wasn't like she was rapping on
my door asking what they (the charges) were."
Westfall's account differs from McHenry's. "It was
ten days after the Senate meeting last spring," she
said, "and I said 'Okay, Doug, I'd like to hear what
the specific violations were.' 11<* didn't sav anything.

He just gave me a bunch of garbage which didn't
mean anything."
McHenry denied that he ever called Westfall
"crooked." Technically, Chris Banks who replaced
Westfall as commissioner cited the alleged
irregularities in a speech to the Senate last spring. "He
(Banks) asked me for suggestions on what he should
say in his speech," recalled McHenry. "I told him to
tell them why he wanted the job, and that it had been
rumored that there were some campaign irregularities
under the Westfall commissionership.
$200 limit
"According to Loudin Beam (a candidate for
president last year)," McHenry continued, "his ticket
of Cory, Mattson and Beam spent at least $100 over
the authorized $200 limit.

this over-expenditure. "I'm willing to admit that, and
we were outgunned," he said.
But McHenry insisted that "to me this is very
important because I think that the elections
commissioner has to make an active effort to enforce
any rule under his charge, and that rule of the $200
limit is embedded in the constitution. And according
to that ticket, she didn't make an active enough
effort, and she didn't even request the receipts of the
candidates last year."
"In one sense," said Cory, "McHenry is right if
you're talking about the specified duties of the
election commissioner. It's true that Janet Westfall,
by strict standards, didn't perform adequately. But
that's no condemnation of Jan. Nobody can do it."
Campaign Rules
Westfall insists that she made an effort to enforce
the $200 ceiling. "I handed out to all the candidates a
list of the campaign rules. There's a stipulation that
you can't spend over $200 but it is up to the
discretion of the elections commissioner what is
done."
The former elections commissioner said that she
"saw no point" in requiring receipts from the
primaries. "It was up to my discretion that it was not
necessary for a list of expenditures for all the
candidates because if those who didn't make the
finals did over-spend, what point would it make if

they lost? As long as no formal complaints were filed,
I saw no reason to pursue it."
Westfall did, however, ask for the receipts of the
two final slates.
Westfall, however, questioned the expenditure
violation. "I find it difficult to believe that the
Matson, Beam & Corey ticket spent over the $20 0
limit. In any event, no one presented me or the ASSU
Senate with charges or evidence of over-spending by
any slate. If Doug believed there were violations," she
concluded, "then why has he withheld the
information so long?"
In last Friday's article, Westfall said that McHenry
apologized to her sometime last month. McHenry
tells it this way: "The only thing I apologized to Jan
Westfall was that I was sorry that I didn't tell her at
least about this minor thing before. (McHenry was
referring to the alleged presence of unauthorized
persons in the counting room during last year's
election night.) But I didn't tell her that I made the
charges up. I apologized that I didn't check out about
unauthorized people being in the counting room. But
that is really no major thing."
McHenry calls this conversation "the first time I
really talked to her" about the charges that were
levelled against WEstfall last spring. But McHenry still
didn't tell Westfall of what he considered to be the
most serious violation for which she was being held
responsible: the over-expenditure of campaign funds.

When asked why he didn't relate these charges last
month, McHenry said, "I wasn't sure that Loudin
wanted it out. When Friday's article came out, I
called him and said I'd have to come out with the
campaign irregularities that I'd charged her (Westfall)
with. He (Beam) agreed.
When asked if the article hadn't come out whether
Westfall would ever have known why she was charged
with irregularities, McHenry answered, "Yes. I could
see that there was a lot of bitterness between Jan and
I. I think I would have told her after the election. I
knew there had been some irregularities that had
occurred — one of which I told her about, the other
of which I didn't."
McHenry's Conclusions
McHenry concluded by summing up his feelings on
the Daily's charges. "First I think the most important
question is the effect that this experience had on Jan
Westfall. I think it hurt her not to know in full all the
campaign irregularities referred to by Chris Banks. If I
had to do it again, even though to me it was a serious
campaign irregularity that so much money was spent
over the allowed limit, I think it was my
responsibility to tell Jan Westfall of the facts as soon
as possible after I made the allegations.
"However, in answer to the Daily's charges,
obviously there were campaign irregularities, and that
to my mind it was not a breach of personal integrity
to play a role in the selection of Louis Humphrey."
