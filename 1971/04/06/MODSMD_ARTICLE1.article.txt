# Pesticide Problem Persists
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
A new report on the health dangers of agricultural
use of pesticides has recently been published by
SWOFSI and the Environmental Research Project.
Two Stanford coeds, Martha Gibson and Ann Watson,
wrote the report, entitled "Pesticide Exposure and
Protection of California Farm Workers" as their
research project for a class last year.
The class was an SWOPSI Seminar called
"Environmental Impact on Health" conducted by
David Sachs, a medical student and Project Director
of the Environmental Research Project at the medical
school. The fifteen students who took the course
were divided up into pairs for their research projects.
"It was supposed to be a three unit, one quarter
course," said Miss Gibson, "but there was too much
work, so it was extended for another quarter." The
two students did much research in the chemistry of
pesticides, the legislation regulating their use, and the
effects of the pesticides on the farmworkers. They
studied Senate testimony and conducted interviews
with physicians, public officials, and Farmworkers
union officials.
Getting The Facts
"One thing I really learned from the report,"
Gibson said, "is that you really have to be careful
with what you use." She cited cases of exaggeration,
and noted that the two placed heavy reliance on
testimony such as Cesar Chavez' before the U.S.

Senate. "We knew the Senate testimony would be
accurate," she said.
The facts are startling enough. The report cites
surveys by the California Department of Public
Health that indicate that "only a fraction of pesticide
poisonings come to the attention of official agencies,
under present circumstances."
Many of those injured simply went to their own
doctors or got help through the Medi-Cal program,
and were not counted in Workmen's Compensation
data. Others did not even seek medical help.
Much of the poisoning results from the misuse of
pesticides: letting pickers enter the fields too soon
after spraying, neglecting protective clothing while
spraying, not washing pesticides off the skin, etc.
In the report the need for education is stressed
perhaps more than anything else. Many of the
workers speak only Spanish, and instructions in
English are no use to them. "How," asked Gibson,
"do you let the workers know the dangers? California
laws are strict about labels, but if the workers don't
read them?" In the report instances are cited of
sprayers discarding protective clothing because it was
too hot.
Protection
Gibson believes that the spread of the
Farmworkers union would be a good thing, as it

would provide a means of education and
compensation, as well as giving farmworkers a chance
to report misuse of pesticides by employers without
fearing the loss of their jobs.
Another crucial factor is the need for research.
"That's the scary thing — just how little is known
about the effects of chemicals" Gibson said. "They
are afraid that the poisonings will get worse because
they're replacing DDT with organophosphates."
Organophosphates are not as persistent in the soil as
DDT, but it has been shown that they can cause
death, while no deaths have been definitely traced to
DDT.
'Hie problems of legislation and enforcement need
to be worked on Gibson believes. "California does
have excellent laws. It is very understandable that
they aren't enforced better, because there are
thousands of farms." The report recommends the
extension of the Workmen's Compensation Plan to
cover farmworkers more fully, and states "economic
sanctions could be built into the laws so that those
who use sprays incorrectly would have to bear the
costs of medical care and compensation for those
workers harmed. This would add an economic
incentive to safe use of pesticides."
Copies of the 26-page report can be purchased for
two dollars each at the SWOPSI office in the Old
Union.


PESTICIDE THREAT—Although California has extensive legislation to protect
the farmworker from injury and illness due to pesticides, the laws are poorly
inforced. Most pesticide related illnesses go unreported.

workers speak only Spanish, and instructions in
English are no use to them. "How," asked Gibson,
"do you let the workers know the dangers? California
laws are strict about labels, but if the workers don't
read them?" In the report instances are cited of
sprayers discarding protective clothing because it was
too hot.
Protection
Gibson believes that the spread of the
Farmworkers union would be a good thing, as it

would provide a means of education and
compensation, as well as giving farmworkers a chance
to report misuse of pesticides by employers without
fearing the loss of their jobs.
Another crucial factor is the need for research.
"That's the scary thing — just how little is known
about the effects of chemicals" Gibson said. "They
are afraid that the poisonings will get worse because
they're replacing DDT with organophosphates."
Organophosphates are not as persistent in the soil as
DDT, but it has been shown that they can cause
death, while no deaths have been definitely traced to
DDT.
'Hie problems of legislation and enforcement need
to be worked on Gibson believes. "California does
have excellent laws. It is very understandable that
they aren't enforced better, because there are
thousands of farms." The report recommends the
extension of the Workmen's Compensation Plan to
cover farmworkers more fully, and states "economic
sanctions could be built into the laws so that those
who use sprays incorrectly would have to bear the
costs of medical care and compensation for those
workers harmed. This would add an economic
incentive to safe use of pesticides."

PESTICIDE THREAT—Although California has extensive legislation to protect
the farmworker from injury and illness due to pesticides, the laws are poorly
inforced. Most pesticide related illnesses go unreported.
A new report on the health dangers of agricultural
use of pesticides has recently been published by
SWOFSI and the Environmental Research Project.
Two Stanford coeds, Martha Gibson and Ann Watson,
wrote the report, entitled "Pesticide Exposure and
Protection of California Farm Workers" as their
research project for a class last year.
The class was an SWOPSI Seminar called
"Environmental Impact on Health" conducted by
David Sachs, a medical student and Project Director
of the Environmental Research Project at the medical
school. The fifteen students who took the course
were divided up into pairs for their research projects.
"It was supposed to be a three unit, one quarter
course," said Miss Gibson, "but there was too much
work, so it was extended for another quarter." The
two students did much research in the chemistry of
pesticides, the legislation regulating their use, and the
effects of the pesticides on the farmworkers. They
studied Senate testimony and conducted interviews
with physicians, public officials, and Farmworkers
union officials.
Getting The Facts
"One thing I really learned from the report,"
Gibson said, "is that you really have to be careful
with what you use." She cited cases of exaggeration,
and noted that the two placed heavy reliance on
testimony such as Cesar Chavez' before the U.S.

Senate. "We knew the Senate testimony would be
accurate," she said.
The facts are startling enough. The report cites
surveys by the California Department of Public
Health that indicate that "only a fraction of pesticide
poisonings come to the attention of official agencies,
under present circumstances."
Many of those injured simply went to their own
doctors or got help through the Medi-Cal program,
and were not counted in Workmen's Compensation
data. Others did not even seek medical help.
Much of the poisoning results from the misuse of
pesticides: letting pickers enter the fields too soon
after spraying, neglecting protective clothing while
spraying, not washing pesticides off the skin, etc.
In the report the need for education is stressed
perhaps more than anything else. Many of the
workers speak only Spanish, and instructions in
English are no use to them. "How," asked Gibson,
"do you let the workers know the dangers? California
laws are strict about labels, but if the workers don't
