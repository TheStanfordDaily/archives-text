# Several Ballot Proposals Lauded And Vilified
## Prohibit Recruiting 
### 
The time is long past to make
peace with people who never
wished to be our enemies. A step
in this direction can be taken by
choosing not to allow either
military or war profiteering
industries to use Stanford
facilities for recruitings a choice
which will be put to the students
of Stanford on April 7.
As Stanford students, we have
the responsibility of existing
within an important cog of a
mechanism vital to the American
war machine. The cog is Stanford
itself, the mechanism, American
universities. By realigning our
position, we can affect the
mechanism as a whole.
Objections to such change is
heard in several forms. A familiar
criticism is that all recruiters have
a "right" to come on campus. In
no way do the proposed charges
inhibit the civil liberties of any
person, corporation, or
organidation. They neither
prohibit anyone from campus, nor
prevent any opinion from being
aired. Indeed, the new rulings
would provide for a more open
atmosphere, by requiring military
and certain corporate proponents
to state their cases publicly,
instead of behind the closed doors
of the Placement Center.
Recruitment Prohibited
What would be prohibited
would be the specific act of
recruitment. Recruitment by a
military system that has produced
the murderous mentality needed
to fight the war in Indochina
would be prohibited. Recruitment
by corporations that daily engage
in competitive bidding in order to
reap profits found in
manufacturing flamethrowers,
fragmentation bombs, napalm,
white phosphorus, herbicides, and
gases would be prohibited. The
tiny, yet important minority of
Stanford students who would be
directly affected by the proposed
changes hopefully would be
willing to take a short journey off
campus in the knowledge that
their community is exerting
pressure on the prospective
employers to withdraw from the
war.
Finally, many people believe
that, while the military is
presently an inhuman institution,
the addition of "Stanford men"
would certainly help to improve
its character. Indeed, the military

is undergoing changes. Orders are
obeyed with lessening frequency,
demonstrations and anti-war
activities are occuring within
military installations, and tight
groups of organizers are working
against the military institution at
bases all over the country. But
very few of these organizers, who
have succeeded in putting officials
on the defensive, are "Stanford
men" who in years past, signed up
with military recruiters.
Increasing Public Awareness
Placing restrictions on certain
recruiting would have several
adverse effects on the status quo
of various warmaking
organizations. Being unable to
recruit on a major university
campus, and hopefully, campuses,
would result in undesirable
publicity, possibly increasing the
public awareness of the close
corporate-university-military
relationship. Also, the
disadvantage of not being able to
directly recruit on campus could
help pressure corporations to
think more carefully before
seeking certain Department of
Defense contracts.
But beyond these concrete
possibilities, we have a much more
exciting opportunity. By
positively denying the use of our
community for acts clearly within
the process of organized death, we
begin to recognize and affirm our
responsibility as individuals with
power, the power to make peace
with those children, women and
men who are being murdered in
each of our names.
It should be abundantly clear,
from the lessons of the past 20
years, and especially from the
exploding domestic anguish
within the last decade, that there
is only one certain way to end the
Indochinese war. Demonstrations
raise consciousness, and elections,
when they occur, revise specific
policies, but the American
sponsored slaughter in Vietnam
requires massive monetary and
physical support. No matter the
high ideals we may express, or the
concepts we hold of "what I
would do if 1 were there," the fact
is that we are all, at this moment,
"there." If our ideals are to
become more than admirable, yet
empty, mental phantoms, they
must be implemented as we live,
not as we dream. Therefore if we
