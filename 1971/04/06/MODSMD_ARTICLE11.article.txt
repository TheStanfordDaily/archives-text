# Referenda Racist
## 
### 
It's spring quarter; the dollies
have begun to bloom. Everybody
is having a great time and can not
understand why people of color
are so uptight. A little dope, good
vibes, and relaxation ... if you
could understand what is
happening here, then you might
just be able to understand why
people of color are always
suspicious of the intentions of
"good" people.
1. On the ASSU Election ballot
will be a referendum to
reapportion (gerrymandering) the
senate, so as to limit the
participation of minorities in
student government. The idea is
to have dormitory complexes
elect their representatives. The
logic being that this makes for
more and better interaction
between senators and their
constituencies. Whereas, we take
the position that the present
system provides the same
potential and certain senators are
maintaining their pledges and are
keeping close contact with their
constituents. We feel that the
reapportionment restricts
minority students from
participating in the senate, i.e.
three senators from the
conglomerate of Lagunita, Roble,
and Florence Moore. Consider
that Roble is a Chicano house this
year and will be a Black house
next year, it is obvious what this
will do to minority representation
in the senate.
2. On the ballot there will be a
referendum concerning fees. As
students you will be asked to vote
for either $0, $1, $3, $5. As
members of the finance
committee we urge you to vote
for $3, for this will give every
organization requesting funds
from the senate the appropriate
amount of money to carry on
their necessary functions. By
voting $0 you would deny many
organizations the necessary funds
to function. The end results being
that many student organizations
would collapse, which to a large
degree would impede the
functioning of ASSU. In voting $0
you not only effect the Black
Student Union, Mecha,
Asian-American Student Alliance,
Third World Union, but you also
destroy the effectiveness of
groups such as the Axe
Commission, Cardinal Board,
Graduate Students Association,
Stanford Conservation Group,
Pre-reg Commission, and Porn-pon
dollies.
3. Also, on the ballot will be a
referendum to limit the funding

of minority groups: BSU 12%
($4,400.00) of the budget,
AASA-5% ($1,900.00),
MECHA-12% ($4,400.00). This
is just another racist attempt to
limit minority participation at
Stanford and in the surrounding
communities. Again, the racist
logic is that the major
organizations (BSU, MECHA,
AASA) receive a huge portion of
the budget, denying other groups
a meaningful share of the budget.
However, in analyzing the total
situation, we find that most
organizations that requested funds
from the ASSU Senate received a
higher percentage of their request
than did the major organization.
Following is the percentage of
the request that many
organizations received last year:
Sequoia 100%
KZSU 80%
Volunteers in Asia 60%
Pom-pon Dollies 83%
Cardinal Board 66%
Axe Commission 69%
MAJOR ORGANIZATIONS
Black Student Union .... 34%
MECHA 24%
AASA 37%
Third World Union 7%
Minorities Not Consulted
As further support of the racist
nature of these referendums, they
were all developed without
consulting with any of the people
that they would effect, namely
minorities. The people who
initiated these referendums made
no attempt to discuss them on
Senate floor or with the student
body at large, but rather they are
putting it on the ballot and
counting on the naivete and lack
of awareness of the student body
to pass them.
Now you have an idea of what
is coming down within student
government at Stanford
University. The same people who
urge minorities to participate in
the system and use the system to
their advantages are now changing
the system of representation and
funding. Once the
system they created to serve
themselves begins to provide
opportunities for other people,
they adopt the logic "we must
destroy it to save it." We would
hate to think that Brother
Malcolm was right when he said:
"When you learn how to play the
white man's game, he changes the
rules on you."

The DAILY received several columns voicing opinions on the
initiatives, amendments and resolutions which will appear on
the ASSU ballot. Due to space limitations, some of those
columns could not be printed. Others could not be published
in their entirety. The DAILY wishes to thank those who
contributed to this page and regrets the necessary deletions.

want peace, we must make peace.
So that the Stanford
Community can move one step
further in ending our DIRECT
COMPLICITY with the war, Vote
YES to prohibit the use of
Stanford lands for military service
recruiting, and Vote YES to
prohibit the use of Stanford lands
by corporations that are directly
producing materiel and research

for the military, "directly
producing" to be defined by a
joint committee of 3 elected
representatives from the Faculty
Senate, 3 elected representatives
from the ASSU Senate, and 3
representatives elected from the
Stanford staff at large, which will
make its decision no later than
May 25,1971.
