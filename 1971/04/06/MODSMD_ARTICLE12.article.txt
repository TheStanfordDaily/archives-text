# Vole Them No Money

When plunder bears the name of
impost [taxJ, fortitude is intimi
dated and wisdom confounded;
resistance shrinks from an alliance
with rebellion, and the villain re
mains secure in the robes of the
magistrate.
- Samuel Johnson
The art of taxation consists in so
plucking the goose as to obtain
the largest amount of feathers
with the least amount of hissing.
—J. B. Colbert
Taxation without representation
is tyranny.
—James Otis
Who is making decisions about
your life, about your money? Are
you? Or is some bureaucrat with
interests of his own?
Communication is very
important when it comes to
people spending your money. If a
person has an attorney who is
acting for him, that person will
confer with the attorney
constantly. Yet do the czars of
the student government power
structure reflect in their actions
the wishes of those over whom
they preside? No. Any
consultation these student
politicos engage in is to give lesser
students the illusion that they are
participating in decisions affecting
their lives.
Bureaucrats always act to
maximize the amount of
discretionary power in their own
hands. The maximum freedom of
choice for those at the top of the
pyramid necessitates the
minimum freedom of choice for
those at the bottom of the
pyramid.
Stanford student government is
a labyrinth, a bureaucratic maze
riddled with graft, corruption,
slush funds, power brokers, and
influence peddlers. Even if the
student government people did
not wish to perpetuate their own
power and enhance their glory,
expecting them to represent you
is ridiculous. Trying to be heard is
a waste of time.

To understand this, remember
the game of "telephone" in which
each person tries to pass on
accurately to the next a message.
The message always comes out
hopelessly distorted, and everyone
laughs. The same unintentional
thing is built into student
government. And it is now and
always will be preserved by those
who wish to use the confusion
caused by overloaded
communications channels to
impose their own stamp on
events. But no one should
laugh- because it's his own money
which is being spent.
Consider the ASSU Senate, a
body for which many had hope
that it would become a place
where innovative educational
reform proposals were thrashed
out. Because of the internal
dynamics of student government,
the ASSU Senate is instead a
shifting alliance of power blocs
trying to loot the treasury.
As a final travesty upon the
ideal of representative
government, Stanford student
government is a living example of
taxation without representation.
Students who will graduate, vote
to tax incoming freshmen,
transfers, and grad students.
Those incoming students are
forced to bear the burden of the
debts voted by a student
generation which has passed on,
having reaped the benefits and
voted that the new students
should help pay for them. What
sort of justice is it for an incoming
freshman to be presented on
arrival with a bill for fees and
special assessments from a student
government he has never
sanctioned, voted for, or
consented to. A summer school
student faces a similar levy.
For all these reasons, we ask
you to vote for a zero dollars
assessment and to vote No on all
special assessments for special
interest groups.
