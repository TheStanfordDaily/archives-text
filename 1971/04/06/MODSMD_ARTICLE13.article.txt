# Budget Initiative
## 
### 
The Budget Initiative is
designed to make the ASSU
Budget for 1971-72 responsive to
the needs of the Stanford student
body.
Such a proposal has never
before been submitted to students
for their direct approval. The
ASSU Senate has framed past
budgets, often without regard for
the wishes of its constituents. This
proposal would take the matter
out of the Senate's hands for
1971-72.
Since students have not yet
voted on the amount of the
1971-72 fee assessment, the
proposal does not allocate dollar
amounts. Instead, it divides
program fee monies by
percentages. This format would
apply to a zero dollar fee (any
percentage of zero is zero) as well
as to fees of $1 or $5.
Sections 1 and 2 of Title I of
the proposal contain these
percentage allocations. The full
text of the measure, showing the
distribution of these allocations,
was printed last week in the Daily,
and will be available at polling
places.
Sections 3, 4, and 5 of Title I
contain technical language which
brings the proposal into
conformity with the ASSU bylaws

requirement of a line item budget.
Each organization slated to
receive funds must submit a
breakdown of its projected
expenditures to the Student
Financial Manager before money
will be released.
Section 6 of Title I makes clear
the authority under which
students act in passing such a
budget. Under the ASSU
Constitution, students can, by
passing an initiative proposition,
enact any legislation within the
power of the student Senate. The
entire proposal is motivated by
the belief that the Senate has
done its job badly in the past.
The allocations in this proposal
guarantee adequate support to
small organizations which depend
on ASSU. In the past two ASSU
Budgets, the student Senate has
sacrificed the interests of these
small groups to the larger
organizations which command
power in the Senate's political
maneuvers.
Under the initiative budget,
generally speaking, smaller
organizations receive
proportionately more and larger
organizations proportionately less
than they have received in the
recent past.
