# Council Declares Support For Proposals
## 
### 
The April ASSU elections will
include a number of ballot issues,
many of some complexity. We
believe several of these
propositions deserve your
support.
1. Vietnam Disengagement
This proposal is probably the
most self explanatory. Although
the vote has no binding effect, it
will, if passed, represent a clear
and simple statement against the
war.
2. Campaign G.M.
For the second year Stanford
must decide whether to vote its
proxies in favor of proposals
submitted to General Motors by
Campaign G.M.
The first proposition will
require that General Motors place
on the proxy not only
management's nominees for
directors, but also candidates
nominated by non-management
shareholders.
The second proposition would
permit three constituencies of
G.M. to nominate one director
each. The three constituencies are
generally employees, dealers, and
customers. A more precise
definition is given in the actual
proposal.
The third proposition would
require General Motors to report
in the Annual Report on its
progress in the area of air
pollution control, auto safety, and
minority hiring. G.M. at present
refuses to fully disclose this
information.
3. Senate Reapportionment
Under the present system of
election of undergraduate student
senators, constituencies are
divided by major- General
Studies, Humanities and Sciences,
and Engineering. This amendment
proposes a change to election
from dormitory groupings.
There are several advantages
which might develop from this
system. First, if a student has a
defined and easily located
constituency, he is more likely to

go to that group during a
campaign, knock on doors, and
present a platform of proposals to
be taken to the student senate.
Second, if the student is elected
from a living area, he is much
more likely to return to that
group to inform them about issues
and solicit ideas.
One major objection has been
raised against the proposal. The
BSU believes that the
reapportionment represents a
gerrymander intended to reduce
the number of minority students
in the Senate.
I disagree with this analysis for
two reasons. First, the present
system of election of senators
does not guarantee that a large
number of minority persons will
be elected. The reason the BSU
had such success last fall was that
they ran the best campaign: 1)
they were the best organized
group, 2) they were the only
group to run a slate, and 3) they
were the only group to use mass
advertising in the Daily. If other
groups should organize to conduct
similar campaigns, these

advantages may very well be
reduced in effectiveness.
Second, the proposed system
does not make it more difficult
for minority persons to be
elected. There are six
constituencies proposed and the
present number of Blacks in each
is as follows:
Stem- proposed 2-blacks 13
Lagunita, Roble & Flo
Mo—proposed 3-blacks 26
Wilbur & Branner-proposed
3-blacks 7 3
Manzanita & Toyon—proposed
2-blacks 31
Row, Clusters & Frats—proposed
4
Off-campus & All
Other- proposed 6
Blacks in above two groups
138-breakdown unavailable.
Total Undergrad. 281
Total Graduate 147
Grad & Undergrad. 428
(Winter Quarter)
Because this is a constitutional
amendment, a 2/3 vote will be
required for its approval.
