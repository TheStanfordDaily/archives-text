The Incomparable LSJUMB
really didn't hijack a 74 7 to Little
Rock, Arkansas. Most Bandsmen
endured the hornicities of their
fellow musicians for two thousand
miles while driving in car pools.
Among other things, they shared
gas expenses. A few even studied
the mating habits of lizards in
Yuma, Arizona while thumbing
their way to Little Rock.
Such exotic activities have
been necessary because substantial
support has never been given to
the Band for trips outside
California. It is this support that is
sought through the initiative on
the Spring ballot.
Most of the Band's budget
comes from two sources: the
Department of Athletics and the
Music Department.
Athletics provides for uniforms

and two trips to Los Angeles, one
during football season and the
other during basketball season.
The Music Department covers
day-to-day operating expenses.
Bands-men have been forced to
solicit donations to finance all
their other activities.
The fee of one dollar per
student per quarter for Autumn
and Winter will make more
experiences like Arkansas a
reality. Possible use of these funds
includes next season's football
opener in Missouri. Other
possibilities are games at West
Point, Seattle, or Corvalis.
Vote for the Band Proposition
if you support Stanford in its
intercourse with other
universities.
