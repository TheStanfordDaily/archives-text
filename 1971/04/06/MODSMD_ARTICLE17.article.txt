# Give Us This Day Our Daily Bread

For the past few years, the
Daily has been hit with a great
financial crisis. Deep in debt due
to overtime costs incurred trying
to cover spring riot activity at
Stanford and plagued by a huge
drop in national advertising, the
Daily has been forced to
drastically reduce its size anr! raise
its ad rate over the past months.
The austerity program is
beginning to pay off. Although
there is a long way to go, and
much debt still to be made up, the
paper will soon be able to return
to a larger number of pages per
issue, with more room for news
on those pages. The financial
story of the Daily is not all told
by the ads and overtime however.
Advertising pays for only 60
percent of the Daily operating
budget, the rest being made up by
University grant for copies of the
paper going to faculty and staff,
and student funds voted last year
in an ASSU election. As decided

last April, for the school year
4 70-'7l the Daily receives a sum of
$1.00 per student per quarter.
This year, due to rising printing
costs and inflation, the Daily asks
for a raise of 25 cents per quarter
from the ASSU. This appears on
the ballot as "$2 per student for
the fall quarter, and $1 per
student for the remaining three
quarters." The baffling logic of
the University computers can not
compute parts of dollars, so we
are therefore precluded from
more simply stating the request
for the raise.
The combined total of $2 for
the fall quarter and $1 for the
other three averages out to the
$1.25 we request.
This increased revenue at a
time when the Daily is moving
forward again under a new
business management will insure
increased size and coverage by the
paper. In-depth news features, will
return along with more cultural
reviews, and sports coverage.

Although advertising income is
expected to increase next year, so
are printing costs, and funds from
the University will most likely
decrease, leaving the paper again
in a precarious state. If minimal
student funds are not approved in
this week's election, the future of
the Daily will be left in doubt.
Most likely, publication would
cease, and the University would
be left without a daily newspaper.
As numerous newspapers
around the country have done,
the Daily is currently working on
gaining its independence from the
University to avoid any future
censorship or financial problems
with both the University
administration and the ASSU, the
Daily's present publisher.
In any event, the initial action
towards independence must be
the building of a strong economic
foundation for the paper. Student
funds have helped provide the
beginning of that foundation
during this first year of transition.
A YES vote on the Daily
proposition this week will not
only insure a continuation of that
building of a solid financial
foundation, but will guarantee the
community an improved, enlarged
daily student newspaper for the
coming year.
