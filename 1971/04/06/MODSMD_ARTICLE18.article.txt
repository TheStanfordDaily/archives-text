# A 						Separate Peace
## 
### 
On the upcoming ballot
Stanford students will have the
opportunity to declare their peace
with the people of Vietnam.
There are three reasons it is
important for Stanford students
to support the Treaty of Peace:
1. We will be stating that
realistic and acceptible conditions
for peace exist and that if the U.S.
government were to accept these
conditions a settlement to the war
could be reached. Most
fundamental to the terms of the
Treaty is the first point: "The
Americans agree to immediate and
total withdrawal from Vietnam
and publicly to set the date by
which all American forces will be
removed." If this one principle
would be accepted and effected
by the U.S. government the way
would be paved toward resolving
all the problems relating to a
ceasefire, the safety of
withdrawing troops, and the
release of all military prisoners.
Popular feeling in the United
States is clearly in support of this
principle. The Gallup Poll of
January 31, 1971, revealed that
73 percent of the American
people want the United States out
of Vietnam by the end of 1971.
2. Hacking the People's Peace
Treaty will demonstrate solidarity
and support for others struggling
for peace, especially students,
veterans, womens groups,
Buddhists, and political prisoners
in South Vietnam. With
the perpetuation of the slaughter
with increased bombing and
escalated military operations in
some regions, the Vietnamese
correctly discern that Nixon's
"Vietnamization" program is an
attempt to insure that all the dead
will be Vietnamese rather than
Americans.

Vietnamese have little interest
in dying for a regime in Saigon
which exists solely on the basis of
its American military backing.
Within the past year a broad
coalition of non-communist
opposition groups have become
increasingly outspoken against the
corruption and illegitimacy of the
Thieu-Ky-Khiem regime and
against the American support of
that regime. The Vietnam
National Students Union
(VNNSU) has publicly issued the
demand that the United States
military forces withdraw from
Vietnam immediately and
unconditionally leaving any
political settlement entirely for
the Vietnamese to work out.
3. Our ratification of the
People's Peace Treaty will jointly
commit us to extricate ourselves
and Stanford University from any
support of the Vietnam war, and
to take positive action against the
war. In addition to voting support
for the Treaty on this week's
student ballot, we strongly
encourage campus living groups,
organizations, collectives, and
departmental groups to mobilize
around the Treaty to initiate
anti-war activities on the campus
and in the community. Each
campus group or individual that
supports the Treaty can find their
own way of acting out their peace
with the Vietnamese.
Ratification of the People's
Peace Treaty by the Stanford
student body will be a significant
step in anti-war action as the
signatories of the Treaty not only
declare their peace with the
Vietnamese people but also take
active measure to create that
peace.
