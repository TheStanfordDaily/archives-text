# Crowd Bops To Sha-Na-Na
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Sha-Na-Na came to Stanford
Friday night and did exactly what
I expected them to do. They
recreated nearly flawlessly the
styles of 1 950's rock and roll, and
a capacity crowd of nearly 2000,
rocked and rolled and shook all
over with excitement and
enthusiasm. It was the same as it
had been the two previous times
I'd seen them.
But I couldn't help but feel
that most of Friday night's
audience hadn't seen them before
and if they had been seeing them
for the second or third time, they
wouldn't have been quite so
keyed.
By the very nature of their
style of bringing back
oldk*-goldies, Sha-Na-Na is
primarily a first time hit. The first
time you see them, the shock is
incredible. It was almost two
years ago when 1 first saw them at
Fillmore and that night myself
and the rest of the audience, who
were expecting some other
second-rafe acid-rock group,
almost went insane over these
living time capsules.
Now we were probably even
more uncontrollably wild than the
audience of Friday night who had
either seen them in Woodstock or
at least had heard about them.
But it was still an exciting
experience to hear such classics as
Dion and the Belmonts' "A
Teenager In Love"; Danny and

the Juniors' "Kock and Roll is
here To Stay," and Bill Haley and
the Comet's "Great Balls of Fire."
Same Old Songs
But with the exception of a
couple of songs, these were the
same numbers they performed at
both Fillmore appearances I'd
seen. There are so many
unbelievable oldies from the sU's,
I wish that Sha-Na-Na would
increase their repitoire a bit and
add some new material. I would
have loved to hear them do songs
like "Peggy Sue," "Kisses Sweeter
Than Wine" and "My Special
Angel."
1 realize that most of the
members of the group are trying
to get through school while they
work and this takes up a lot of
time. And most groups when
they're doing roadshows stick to
their most reliable numbers. But
the group has an enormous talent
for successfully imitating an
incredible number of different
groups and over two years they
should have varied their show
quite a bit more.
Still everyone in the audience
seemed to totally enjoy
Sha-Na-Na. Unfortunately the
presence of a few loud-mouthed
asses made enjoyment of the first
half of the show quite difficult.
The first act, which featured
Kreskin, a well-known mentalist,
was disrupted considerably by
these few over-zealous,
pea-brained adolescents.

Their frequent heckling and
disturbances made much of the
audience uncomfortable and I'm
sure it had to unnerve Kreskin to
some extent. Still he managed to
put on an intriguing show of
mental exercises.
He began his show by taking
three men's rings from the
audience; linking them together
around a stick and then breaking
them apart again.
For the audience participation
part of his act, he had everyone
write down their name or address
or something else they were
thinking of. Then he would
mention something like a city and
when someone stated they were
really thinking of that, and he
would then get down to specifics,
such as reciting their full address.
It was all quite intriguing and
impressive, but if he had received
the audience co-operation he
requested and deserved, he might
have been able to put on a better
performance.
At a college show, one should
be able to expect a mature
audience. Every performer
deserves such, especially a proven
showman whose act's success
depends largely on how well his
audience co-operates.
But still, both Kreskin's and
Sha-NaNa's acts turned out quite
successfully, especially for those
who were seeing both shows for
the first time.

depends largely on how well his
audience co-operates.
But still, both Kreskin's and
Sha-NaNa's acts turned out quite
successfully, especially for those
who were seeing both shows for
the first time.
Sha-Na-Na came to Stanford
Friday night and did exactly what
I expected them to do. They
recreated nearly flawlessly the
styles of 1 950's rock and roll, and
a capacity crowd of nearly 2000,
rocked and rolled and shook all
over with excitement and
enthusiasm. It was the same as it
had been the two previous times
I'd seen them.
But I couldn't help but feel
that most of Friday night's
audience hadn't seen them before
and if they had been seeing them
for the second or third time, they
wouldn't have been quite so
keyed.
By the very nature of their
style of bringing back
oldk*-goldies, Sha-Na-Na is
primarily a first time hit. The first
time you see them, the shock is
incredible. It was almost two
years ago when 1 first saw them at
Fillmore and that night myself
and the rest of the audience, who
were expecting some other
second-rafe acid-rock group,
almost went insane over these
living time capsules.
Now we were probably even
more uncontrollably wild than the
audience of Friday night who had
either seen them in Woodstock or
at least had heard about them.
But it was still an exciting
experience to hear such classics as
Dion and the Belmonts' "A
Teenager In Love"; Danny and

the Juniors' "Kock and Roll is
here To Stay," and Bill Haley and
the Comet's "Great Balls of Fire."
Same Old Songs
But with the exception of a
couple of songs, these were the
same numbers they performed at
both Fillmore appearances I'd
seen. There are so many
unbelievable oldies from the sU's,
I wish that Sha-Na-Na would
increase their repitoire a bit and
add some new material. I would
have loved to hear them do songs
like "Peggy Sue," "Kisses Sweeter
Than Wine" and "My Special
Angel."
1 realize that most of the
members of the group are trying
to get through school while they
work and this takes up a lot of
time. And most groups when
they're doing roadshows stick to
their most reliable numbers. But
the group has an enormous talent
for successfully imitating an
incredible number of different
groups and over two years they
should have varied their show
quite a bit more.
Still everyone in the audience
seemed to totally enjoy
Sha-Na-Na. Unfortunately the
presence of a few loud-mouthed
asses made enjoyment of the first
half of the show quite difficult.
The first act, which featured
Kreskin, a well-known mentalist,
was disrupted considerably by
these few over-zealous,
pea-brained adolescents.

Their frequent heckling and
disturbances made much of the
audience uncomfortable and I'm
sure it had to unnerve Kreskin to
some extent. Still he managed to
put on an intriguing show of
mental exercises.
He began his show by taking
three men's rings from the
audience; linking them together
around a stick and then breaking
them apart again.
For the audience participation
part of his act, he had everyone
write down their name or address
or something else they were
thinking of. Then he would
mention something like a city and
when someone stated they were
really thinking of that, and he
would then get down to specifics,
such as reciting their full address.
It was all quite intriguing and
impressive, but if he had received
the audience co-operation he
requested and deserved, he might
have been able to put on a better
performance.
At a college show, one should
be able to expect a mature
audience. Every performer
deserves such, especially a proven
showman whose act's success
depends largely on how well his
audience co-operates.
But still, both Kreskin's and
Sha-NaNa's acts turned out quite
successfully, especially for those
who were seeing both shows for
