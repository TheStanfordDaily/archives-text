# SUN Responds To Fiscal Crisis
## 
### DAVE GLOSSBRENNER 
What can the individual student do
to help Stanford in its present financial
crisis?
The members of Stanford University
now (SUN) think they have an answer.
Through a lecture series, seminars, and
several miscellaneous mailings they
have attempted to inform the student
body of the University's financial
situation.
Aware that the University runs on
dollars and not on words, the members
of SUN still feel their main purpose is
one of information. SUN is a student
organization and therefore its members
feel that they can best reach the
student body.
Letters sent by SUN announced a
group of seminars to be held in the
dorms in late February. These meetings
"aimed at widening" the student's
understanding of the University's
financial structure, had such speakers as
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice-president of
finance, and Ray Bacchetti, associate
provost.
Lecture Series
In addition, a series of eight lectures
covering different aspects of university
finance was run in February and March.

The last lecture in the series was to be
on March 11 and it was to be given by
President Lyman. However, it had to be
cancelled due to the president's
schedule.
Hans Carstensen, who works for the
University department of finance and
who directs the SUN program believes
that the lectures and seminars were a
success. He regretted that the
president's speech had to be cancelled
and doubts that it can be rescheduled.
He feels, however, that students
working on SUN gain invaluable
experience and that the organization
has been able to reach at least part of
the student body.
A measure of that success will be the
number of student donations received
by the University. While SUN has
primarily attempted to be an
informational body this year, it did
send out two solicitations to the
student body as a whole.
In a multiple choice solicitation,
each student was given five areas to
which to address his gift. These
included a general scholarship fund, an
academic innovation fund, a student
initiative fund, and the university as an
unrestricted gift.

The innovation, projects, and
initiative funds are monies used by
student projects and organizations.
Such things as SCIRE and KZSU
receive support from these areas.
Unfavorable Reactions
Carstensen admitted that there had
been many unfavorable reactions to the
mass mailings. He seemed to feel,
however, that it was a necessary evil in
the business of raising money for the
University.
Last year, the first year of SUN, the
solicitations brought in about $5300, a
third of which came from the senior
class. While the figure is not impressive,
money raising is only part of the
program. Students are not noted for
their fiscal generosity.
Although SUN is only two years old
it has a partner in the Heritage Fund.
This latter organization is also student
run and was set up by a donation of the
Class of 1965. It solicits funds from
local businesses.
The Class of '65 also set up the
Martin Luther King Fund (or the
Senior Fund) which originally gave
scholarships to minority students. The
fund seeks donations from the faculty

and staff and offers scholarships to all
students with an eye to minorities.
Thread of Continuity
The thread that ties this all together
is the fifty to sixty member Student
Development Committee. Most of the
financial support for such things as
printing and mailing comes from the
department of finance. Carstensen acts
as the go-between and his office works
up most of the printings from layouts
made by the students.
In addition to collecting money and
setting up lectures, the students in
these organizations have gone out to
talk to alumni in an attempt to give
them a student's view of the University.
Because SUN and the other groups are
composed of students from "all ranges
of the political spectrum" these views
are far from one-sided. The whole SUN
program is designed to get the
individual student involved in, and
aware of, the University's financial
crisis situation.
