# Nyro Creates Intense Mood
## 
### JANE CORRIGAN 
Although critics can still make
justified complaints that Laura
Nyro is bitchy and neurotic, her
concert Sunday night in Mem Aud
was sufficient proof of the
essential insignificance of all such
charges, when measured against
her talent, creativity and other
personal assets.
Her performance was musically
outstanding, emotionally intense,
highly gratifying and carried off
with a surprising charm and grace
as well. 'Hie program was a
well-balanced selection of songs
from her albums and new
material, and although Nyro does
have a difficult time relating to
her audience, she obviously
enjoyed performing and did it
well.
Laura Nyro's voice is

amazingly powerful and capable
of covering an enormous range,
and these qualities are much more
evident live than on her albums,
where it is often toned down or
minimized by the orchestral
background.
Her own piano-playing is by far
the best accompaniment she could
possibly have, and Sunday night,
the unity of voice and instrument,
each echoing and reinforcing the
other, provided an entirely
satisfactory musical experience.
There was no sense of something
missing, no inadequacies in the
sound of just one woman and one
piano. Instead, Mem Aud
reverberated with her noise and
rhythm.
Mixture of Songs
Playing for about an hour to an
almost entirely full house, she
presented a mixture of songs from
her first album, such as "Stoned
Soul Picnic" and a "Stoney End,"
which made Barbra Streisand's
version sound as monotonous and
silly as it really is, more recent
material from "New York
Tendaberry" and "Christmas and
The Beads of Sweat," such as
"Brown Earth," "Map to the
Treasure" and "Christmas in my
Soul," and several new songs.
"Christmas in My Soul,"
followed bv "Save the Country,"

constituted the only political
messages of the evening, her own
kind at politics based on God and
love more than ideology. In
"Christmas," she sings,
Black Panther brothers
bound in jail
Chicago 7
and the justice scale
Homeless Indian
of Manhattan Isle
All God's sons have gone to
trial
and all God's love gone out of
style.
Basic Optimism
She loves her country as it dies,
hates the heartlessness that
prevails, but still manages to feel
optimism, that the people will
win, "for thee America her
dignity, for all the high court
world to see."
One of her two new songs,
sung as part of her second encore,
"Mother Earth," also reflects this
optimism, the same as that found
in "Time and Love." It is a hymn
to the virtues of of natural love,
the bounty and goodness of
Mother Earth, whose lover is God,
and who can heal you with her
wisdom and love, a happy song
played lightly and quickly, full of
smiles.
The other, "I Am the Blues," is
a return to the melancholy mood

of pain and loneliness which is so
prevalent on the "Eli" album, a
song of a street walking woman,
selling herself in a market without
any buyers, alone with her smoke
and ashes. In sound and feeling, it
is very close to "Buy and Sell,"
which she also sang, or "Woman's
Blues."
Ignores Audience
The only problem with the
concert was the attitude of Nyro
towards her audience. Although
she played and sang with
enthusiasm and feeling and was
received with tremendous warmth
by the crowd in Mem Aud, she
formally refused to relate or
respond to it.
Whether this diffidence is due
to shyness, a desire to conform
with an established style, or a real
feeling of distance and distaste is
difficult to say,but the soft tone
of her speaking voice and the
charm of her rare smile are so
pleasant that the concert as a
whole would have been
significantly improved if they had
been on stage more often.
Don Cooper, who was the first
act, played the guitar and sang his
o* n music, folksongs with
intellignet lyrics. There was a lot
of good humor off his album,
"The Ballad of C.P. Jones,"
Cooper did his warm-up job
well—his set was short enough and
good enough to leave the audience
warm and happy, ready for the
fine purple Nyro that followed
him on stage to do such an
amazing job with her voice and
her piano.
