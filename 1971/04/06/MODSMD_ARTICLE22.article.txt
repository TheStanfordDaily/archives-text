Plaintiffs Sought
A Stanford law student and an
attorney in San Jose are looking for
suitable plaintiffs for a law suit
challenging the constitutionality of
California statutes governing the
registration and voting of eighteen year
olds.
To help initiate the suit the
attorneys are seeking a number of
qualified minors to act as plaintiffs. To
qualify as a plaintiff a person must be:
1) nineteen years old or younger, 2)
living in a different county from his
parents, 3) living off campus and in
Santa Clara Conty, and 4) consider his
"residence" to be his actual place of
dwelling as opposed to his parents'
residence. At least two plaintiffs are
needed, one student and one
non-student who is financially
independent from his parents.
Anyone having information as to
qualified persons who may be willing to

participate in this precedent setting
case is requested to call John Heaney,
H54-0786.
Planetary Tour
Three Stanford researchers are
among 108 scientists from the United
States and six foreign countries chosen

explore those planets of the solar
system that lie beyond the orbit of
Mars. The first of the probes is
scheduled to be launched in 1976. The
