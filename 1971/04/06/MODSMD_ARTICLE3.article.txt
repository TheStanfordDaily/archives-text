# Healed Exchange
## Charges Emerge From BSU Rally 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
A noon rally called by the BSU
yesterday to "inform" the community
about a proposed referendum to revise
the student voting constituencies
dissolved into a heated exchange
between former BSU chairman Leo
Bazile and Senate Parliamentarian Herb
Borock over remarks Bazile attributed
to Tina Swent.
Swent is running in the
vice-presidential slot of one of the five
tickets for the ASSU presidency.
The rally drew 150 onlookers at its
peak.
Bazile accused Swent of calling
Doug McHenry and Diane Fields, black
members of another presidential slate,
"bourgeois Uncle Toms." Borock then
stepped to the microphone and said
"Leo is lying." Fields then stepped to
the mike to defend Bazile's statement.
Subsequent statements by Swent,
Fields, and Ann Kimball, another
member of the Mcllenry-Fields slate, in
interviews in the Daily office, revealed
that the charges were an outgrowth of a
misinterpretation of remarks which
Swent made to Kimball and Henry
Sayre, the McHenry slate's campaign
manager, concerning the slate's position
papers.
The remarks, which were criticisms
of sections of Field's position paper
dealing with minorities, to the rest of
the slate. The remarks were
subsequently passed on to Bazile, who
repeated them at the rally as direct

quotes, adding that Swent "did nothing
[for her campaign| but sit in Tresidder
all night long running down men."
In their interviews, Kimball, Fields
and Bazile emphasized that Bazile was
speaking for himself, and not as a
spokesman for their ticket. The women
also disassociated themselves from any
sexist overtones contained in Bazile's
remarks.
Both the McHenry slate and the
Mimi Winslow slate, on which Swent is
running, regretted that the incident had
occurred. "We want to run this election
on issues, and not on personalities,"
Kimball said.
Sayre said, "I'm sorry that this ever
happened. 1 really respect Tina and
Mimi. The last thing I'd want to do is
slander them."
The original focus of the BSU rally
was the "racist" referendum being
placed on the upcoming ballot. The
referendum reapportions the
constituencies which vote in the ASSU
senatorial elections so that students
would be assigned representative on the
basis of their residences, rather than on
the basis of their schools, as is now the
case.
Bazile termed this referendum
"racist gerrymandering," and added,
"I'd hate to think that this was an
example of what Brother Malcolm X
told us: 'When you play the white
man's game and begin to win, he
changes the rules on you."
Bazile also blasted the inclusion of a

$0 possibility on the program fee. He
said that people in the University were
maneuvering so "Doug McHenry can
get elected and not have any money to
run the place with."
In addition, Bazile re-emphasized his
oft-repeated contention that he does
not trust any whites- conservatives,
moderates, or radicals.
He stated that, when a black
candidate ran for the ASSU presidency,
his credentials were challenged, "but
nobody questions the credentials of the
so-called white radicals on this
campus."

get elected and not have any money to
run the place with."
In addition, Bazile re-emphasized his
oft-repeated contention that he does
not trust any whites- conservatives,
moderates, or radicals.
He stated that, when a black
candidate ran for the ASSU presidency,
his credentials were challenged, "but
nobody questions the credentials of the
so-called white radicals on this
campus."
A noon rally called by the BSU
yesterday to "inform" the community
about a proposed referendum to revise
the student voting constituencies
dissolved into a heated exchange
between former BSU chairman Leo
Bazile and Senate Parliamentarian Herb
Borock over remarks Bazile attributed
to Tina Swent.
Swent is running in the
vice-presidential slot of one of the five
tickets for the ASSU presidency.
The rally drew 150 onlookers at its
peak.
Bazile accused Swent of calling
Doug McHenry and Diane Fields, black
members of another presidential slate,
"bourgeois Uncle Toms." Borock then
stepped to the microphone and said
"Leo is lying." Fields then stepped to
the mike to defend Bazile's statement.
Subsequent statements by Swent,
Fields, and Ann Kimball, another
member of the Mcllenry-Fields slate, in
interviews in the Daily office, revealed
that the charges were an outgrowth of a
misinterpretation of remarks which
Swent made to Kimball and Henry
Sayre, the McHenry slate's campaign
manager, concerning the slate's position
papers.
The remarks, which were criticisms
of sections of Field's position paper
dealing with minorities, to the rest of
the slate. The remarks were
subsequently passed on to Bazile, who
repeated them at the rally as direct

quotes, adding that Swent "did nothing
[for her campaign| but sit in Tresidder
all night long running down men."
In their interviews, Kimball, Fields
and Bazile emphasized that Bazile was
speaking for himself, and not as a
spokesman for their ticket. The women
also disassociated themselves from any
sexist overtones contained in Bazile's
remarks.
Both the McHenry slate and the
Mimi Winslow slate, on which Swent is
running, regretted that the incident had
occurred. "We want to run this election
on issues, and not on personalities,"
Kimball said.
Sayre said, "I'm sorry that this ever
happened. 1 really respect Tina and
Mimi. The last thing I'd want to do is
slander them."
The original focus of the BSU rally
was the "racist" referendum being
placed on the upcoming ballot. The
referendum reapportions the
constituencies which vote in the ASSU
senatorial elections so that students
would be assigned representative on the
basis of their residences, rather than on
the basis of their schools, as is now the
case.
Bazile termed this referendum
"racist gerrymandering," and added,
"I'd hate to think that this was an
example of what Brother Malcolm X
told us: 'When you play the white
man's game and begin to win, he
changes the rules on you."
Bazile also blasted the inclusion of a

$0 possibility on the program fee. He
said that people in the University were
maneuvering so "Doug McHenry can
get elected and not have any money to
run the place with."
