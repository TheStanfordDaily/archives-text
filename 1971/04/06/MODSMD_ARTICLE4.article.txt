# China Week Begins With Lectures, Films

### ROBERTA FARB 
Dr. Joshua Horn, "the People's
Doctor," spoke to a crowd of 100 on
"Medicine in China and tne Cultural
Revolution" Monday afternoon. The
British doctor described "the
metamorphosis of an impoverished,
disease-ridden country into a
democratic, purposeful society." That
charge, said Dr. Horn, was the creation
of the Chinese people.
China has mobilized the energy of
her masses to create the most "vital,
progressive, developed, promising
country on the fact of the earth," said
Horn.
Dr. Horn spent 195 4-69 in China,
mostly in the countryside with a
mobile medical team of volunteers
from urban hospitals, sharing the life of
the Chinese people. He helped to
reverse the trend of doctors moving
away from the countryside where they
are most needed by peasants.
The English surgeon recalled the
burgeoning of the movement to bring
medical services to the countryside.
Realistically, this movement had to
include training more people. And, in
typical Chinese fashion, the masses
were relied upon. A medical school was
built, 32 students were recruited amont
the peasantry according to their
political standing, and the doctors were
in business.
In a process of continuing
education, these peasants return for
further training each fall. By the time
the Cultural Revolution was

approaching its end, 1,000,000
peasants had been trained in the health
field.
Even more significant, said Horn,
was the transformation of the medical
workers themselves. "They had to
change their ideology," explained
Horn, "by living the same kind of life
as the people that they served. They
studied and they underwent
self-criticism."
Horn praised the value of "the little
red book" that revels the thoughts of
Chairman Mao. "With it, the masses can
learn to accomplish anything," said
Horn.
Such knowledge is strength, said
Horn. And that strength can be
mobilized in mass attacks on disease.
The doctor illustrated his point in the
miraculous victory over venereal disease
accomplished in recent years in China.
By generating social conscience,
training an army of ordinary workers in
crash medical courses to cope with the
afflicted, and channeling the energies of
the masses, venereal disease was attacked
and wiped out.
Thanks to the further
democratization of China which
occurred during the Cultural
Revolution, "every cook can and is
running the state," concluded Horn.
The complex subject of the Cultural
Revolution was further discussed last
night in Cubberly Auditorium in a
first-hand report by Alex Hing and
Chris Milton.
Hing was a student delegate with the
U.S. People's Anti-Imperialist
Movement, organized by the Black
Panthers. He described the biocide he
witnessed in Asia and the enactment of
the struggle between the forces of
socialism and imperialism.
After tracing the pattern of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, Hing
discussed the role of the Red Guard in
the Cultural Revolution. He labelled
the Revolution "the highest level of
freedom of speech."
Fellow delegate Chris Milton
stressed the need for a "sympathetic
perspective" in viewing the Cultural
Revolution which he described as a
"revolution in the superstructure of
society."
A film shown earlier in the day to
kick off China Week showed such
changes in Chinese society. Rene Burri,
in China's Villages in Change, pointed
out economic, health, and educational
benefits to villages resulting from the
Revolution of 1949. But he emphasized
the desire of the people to possess their
own land.

charge, said Dr. Horn, was the creation
of the Chinese people.
China has mobilized the energy of
her masses to create the most "vital,
progressive, developed, promising
country on the fact of the earth," said
Horn.
Dr. Horn spent 195 4-69 in China,
mostly in the countryside with a
mobile medical team of volunteers
from urban hospitals, sharing the life of
the Chinese people. He helped to
reverse the trend of doctors moving
away from the countryside where they
are most needed by peasants.
The English surgeon recalled the
burgeoning of the movement to bring
medical services to the countryside.
Realistically, this movement had to
include training more people. And, in
typical Chinese fashion, the masses
were relied upon. A medical school was
built, 32 students were recruited amont
the peasantry according to their
political standing, and the doctors were
in business.
In a process of continuing
education, these peasants return for
further training each fall. By the time
the Cultural Revolution was

approaching its end, 1,000,000
peasants had been trained in the health
field.
Even more significant, said Horn,
was the transformation of the medical
workers themselves. "They had to
change their ideology," explained
Horn, "by living the same kind of life
as the people that they served. They
studied and they underwent
self-criticism."
Horn praised the value of "the little
red book" that revels the thoughts of
Chairman Mao. "With it, the masses can
learn to accomplish anything," said
Horn.
Such knowledge is strength, said
Horn. And that strength can be
mobilized in mass attacks on disease.
The doctor illustrated his point in the
miraculous victory over venereal disease
accomplished in recent years in China.
By generating social conscience,
training an army of ordinary workers in
crash medical courses to cope with the
afflicted, and channeling the energies of
the masses, venereal disease was attacked
and wiped out.
Thanks to the further
democratization of China which
occurred during the Cultural
Revolution, "every cook can and is
running the state," concluded Horn.
The complex subject of the Cultural
Revolution was further discussed last
night in Cubberly Auditorium in a
first-hand report by Alex Hing and
Chris Milton.
Hing was a student delegate with the
U.S. People's Anti-Imperialist
Movement, organized by the Black
Panthers. He described the biocide he
witnessed in Asia and the enactment of
the struggle between the forces of
socialism and imperialism.
After tracing the pattern of U.S.
involvement in Vietnam, Hing
discussed the role of the Red Guard in
the Cultural Revolution. He labelled
the Revolution "the highest level of
freedom of speech."
Fellow delegate Chris Milton
stressed the need for a "sympathetic
perspective" in viewing the Cultural
Revolution which he described as a
"revolution in the superstructure of
society."
A film shown earlier in the day to
kick off China Week showed such
changes in Chinese society. Rene Burri,
in China's Villages in Change, pointed
out economic, health, and educational
benefits to villages resulting from the
Revolution of 1949. But he emphasized
the desire of the people to possess their
own land.
Dr. Joshua Horn, "the People's
Doctor," spoke to a crowd of 100 on
"Medicine in China and tne Cultural
Revolution" Monday afternoon. The
British doctor described "the
metamorphosis of an impoverished,
disease-ridden country into a
democratic, purposeful society." That
charge, said Dr. Horn, was the creation
of the Chinese people.
