# Chicago's Mayor Makes Fifth Bid For Office
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON News Analysis 
The polls are open today in Chicago,
and everybody's prediction is that
Richard J. Daley will be elected to an
unprecedented fifth term as mayor of
the "windy city."
Having won his four previous
contests bv majorities of 55, 71, 56 and
7 4 percent, 69 year old Daley this year
is opposed by Richard Friedman a 41
year old lawyer who made his
reputation exposing scandals as head of
the Chicago Better Government
Association.
Friedman, who has a brown belt in
Judo, flies a glider, and is a hot air
balloonist, among other hobbies is
generally considered to have about as
much chance of defeating Daley as
General Custer did the Sioux.
However, Friedman has waged a
vigorous campaign with limited
resources, and unlike the non-campaign
waged against Daley by John Waner
four years ago, people at least know
who Friedman is.
The overriding issue in the
campaign, of course has been Mayor
Daley himself, who has dominated
Cook County politics for the past 16
years.

Most of the people for Friedman are
not really for Friedman, it seems, but
rather want a change from the
"bossisni" and "machine politics" they
have know from Daley for the past
decade and a half.
Daley's platform is essentially that
under his leadership, Chicago is the best
run city in the country;
—the streets are probably the
cleanest and best illuminated of any
metropolitan area.
—while national crime has risen II
percent, Chicago actually witnessed a .4
percent decline
—the fire department is among the
best in the country
—the police department is one of the
highest paid, with some of the most
modern equipment in the country
—Daley has managed to keep
corporate firms inside the city limits so
that Chicago has one of the few
expanding tax bases in the country
—Chicago municipal bonds receive
the highest rating given by Standard
and Poor's.
However, Chicago, like all major
cities has some serious problems, some'
far more serious than in other major
metropolitan areas. Chicago has one of
the largest black infant mortality rates

in the country while 51 out of 5 7
Chicago high schools are below the
national average in IQ achievement.
Deficiencies
Friedman has been quick to point
out these deficiencies, particularly
blasting the city health program.
One issue which has been a focal
point in the mayoral campaign has been
the question of public housing and its
racial overtones.
In 1 969, U.S. District Court Judge
Richard B. Austin ordered the Chicago
Housing Authority (CI1A) to end
construction of segregated public
housing.
Previously the CIIA had constructed
public housing in all black
neighborhoods, which many critics
charged merely perpetuated the
ghettos.
The Austin ruling calls for
construction of public housing in white
neighborhoods.
This <»!' course had scared the whites,
who don't want blacks from the ghetto
being moved into their neighborhoods.
As one white woman who lives in a
predominantly black neighborhood put
it, "What kind of people are in public
housing? Illiterate, dumb, ignorant.
Could von cone with thai? Could vou

live with people who are illiterate and
dumb, didn't even go to grammar
school? And their greatest ambition is
to have babies?"
Empty Promise
Daley, in his campaign has promised
that public housing will not be built in
neighborhoods that don't want it, a
promise however many feel Daley will
forget after the election, and a promise
Dick Friedman is doing his best in
white precincts to call an empty one.
Friedman has called for local
neighborhood control of public
housing, which he claims will make
neighborhoods more receptive to public
housing, a somewhat doubtful premise
since it has been the neighborhood
intransingence which has largely been
responsible for the segregation in public
housing.
The whole issue of public housing of
course brings up the Chicago's blacks,
now 32 percent of the city's
population.
Chicago's blacks have traditionally
produced a heavy democratic turnout.
However, Rev. Jesse Jackson
charismatic black leader unnable to run
for mayor due to State electoral laws
recently called for the formation of a
