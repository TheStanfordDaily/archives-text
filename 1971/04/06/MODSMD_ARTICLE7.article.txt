## ASSU Presidential Candidates' Statements Plow, Baker

Candidate photos by Lee Greathouse
The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose
' V follov/f.".v•
pp, ,■,al of the %') fei
assessment of tion on the ballot.
This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.
Most graduate students, for
instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in
past years, and have received
nothing in return.
2. Approval of the measure
which fixes the percentage of the
budget that is to go to each group,
in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied
interests. Some of these concern peace, a cleaner
environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to
you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

"kill a pig," and then have a
pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.
3) Lower Hoover Tower 6 (six)
floors into the ground. This would
eliminate the structural problems,
and would also make the top
more accessible to visitors.
4 ) In spirit of the shortening of
official hames, such as "Flo Mo,"
"Mem Chu," "Hoo Tow," etc., I
propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored
and respected: "Tee Cher."
5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

McWatt turned again, dipped his wings once in salute, decided oh,
well, what the hell, and flew into a mountain. "—CATCH 22
Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.
We are not afraid to incur Lyman's displeasure.
Sisterhood is Powerful; Support the Peace Treaty; Get in On!

in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied
interests. Some of these concern peace, a cleaner
environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to
you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

"kill a pig," and then have a
pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.
3) Lower Hoover Tower 6 (six)
floors into the ground. This would
eliminate the structural problems,
and would also make the top
more accessible to visitors.
4 ) In spirit of the shortening of
official hames, such as "Flo Mo,"
"Mem Chu," "Hoo Tow," etc., I
propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored
and respected: "Tee Cher."
5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

McWatt turned again, dipped his wings once in salute, decided oh,

Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.
We are not afraid to incur Lyman's displeasure.

The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose

This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.

instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in

nothing in return.

you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

"kill a pig," and then have a
pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.
3) Lower Hoover Tower 6 (six)
floors into the ground. This would
eliminate the structural problems,
and would also make the top
more accessible to visitors.
4 ) In spirit of the shortening of
official hames, such as "Flo Mo,"
"Mem Chu," "Hoo Tow," etc., I
propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored
and respected: "Tee Cher."
5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

McWatt turned again, dipped his wings once in salute, decided oh,
well, what the hell, and flew into a mountain. "—CATCH 22
Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.
We are not afraid to incur Lyman's displeasure.

The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose
' V follov/f.".v•
pp, ,■,al of the %') fei
assessment of tion on the ballot.
This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.
Most graduate students, for
instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in
past years, and have received
nothing in return.
2. Approval of the measure
which fixes the percentage of the
budget that is to go to each group,
in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied

environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to

5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

McWatt turned again, dipped his wings once in salute, decided oh,
well, what the hell, and flew into a mountain. "—CATCH 22
Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.
We are not afraid to incur Lyman's displeasure.

The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose
' V follov/f.".v•
pp, ,■,al of the %') fei
assessment of tion on the ballot.
This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.
Most graduate students, for
instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in
past years, and have received
nothing in return.
2. Approval of the measure
which fixes the percentage of the
budget that is to go to each group,
in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied
interests. Some of these concern peace, a cleaner
environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to
you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.

propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored

Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.

Candidate photos by Lee Greathouse
The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose
' V follov/f.".v•
pp, ,■,al of the %') fei
assessment of tion on the ballot.
This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.
Most graduate students, for
instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in
past years, and have received
nothing in return.
2. Approval of the measure
which fixes the percentage of the
budget that is to go to each group,
in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied
interests. Some of these concern peace, a cleaner
environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to
you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

"kill a pig," and then have a
pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.
3) Lower Hoover Tower 6 (six)
floors into the ground. This would
eliminate the structural problems,
and would also make the top
more accessible to visitors.
4 ) In spirit of the shortening of
official hames, such as "Flo Mo,"
"Mem Chu," "Hoo Tow," etc., I
propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored
and respected: "Tee Cher."
5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
1. A clarification of the Fundamental Standard recognizing that
most actions now tried are political. Cases would be judged on their
consistency with community standards, and on their beneficial or
detrimental effects on the community. For example, if murder was
considered a punishable action, then war research which contributed
directly to murder in Indochina would be inconsistant with
community standards. If an alleged action were proved favorable, the
defendants would receive a letter of commendation. One would be
concerned with larger issues than narrowly defined disruption.
2. An all student tribunal, chosen by students and with total
jurisdiction over all student cases, with a sub-committee for Honor
Code violations.
3. A public defender with a salary equivalent to the prosecutor's
but hired by and responsible only to students.
4. A right to appeal convictions to an appeals board chosen by and
from the membership of the Student Senate, with the President's
power limited to pardoning and reducing penalties.
5. Photographs and off-campus convictions would be inadmissable
as evidence in a student hearing. We plan to work with the roots of
the problems here at Stanford and in the surrounding community. But
that sort of organizing will continue with or without the ASSU. We
plan to use the ASSU as a counterbalancing force to the
administration when it works to the detriment of students and the
community. As student presidents we will use our titular position to
act as a truth squad for the students.
We are not afraid to incur Lyman's displeasure.

The position of the slates and any unintended prominance of any slate
does not reflect DAILY endorsement. DAILY endorsements of
candidates and referenda will appear in tomorrow's paper. The
Mickelson—Levin and Single—Hewitt slates, which will appear on the
ballot, have been voluntarily withdrawn and request no one to vote
for them since they will be unable to fulfill the duties of the
President.

Student government at
Stanford is bureaucratic and
unrepresentative, and should be
abolished. The inequities inherent
in the present ASSU structure
need not continue. We are the
only candidates committed to
remove them.
We firmly believe that the
University should not and can not
be a political institution. The
range of viewpoints in an
-academic community is too
diverse to allow any one group to
attempt to speak for the whole.
The proper function of student
government is to ensure that all
viewpoints may be expressed
freely. Thus, the ASSU may not
be used to further the political
ideals of one group to the
detriment of another, no matter
how popular these ideals appear
to be.
Political and social actions
must be left to individuals or
voluntary associations; we
encourage personal initiative and
non-violent involvement. But
effective action can never be
accomplished through the ASSU
structure. Every year, candidates
pledge Relevance, Involvement,
and Action through the
ASSU—every year, nothing
happens. It is time to admit that
nothing will happen.
The wave of violence in the
name of involvement at Stanford
has only further jeopardized the
already serious financial situation.
Programs for minority students,
needed scholarships, and
improved facilities have all been
affected. The use of violence as a
means of change is as
unacceptable as the use of the
ASSU structure. Both ignore the
potential of the individual to
effect meaningful change without
resorting to coercion, a feature of
both the mob and the
bureaucracy.
In order to maximize
individual freedom, we propose
' V follov/f.".v•
pp, ,■,al of the %') fei
assessment of tion on the ballot.
This is crucial to the removal of
present inequities. At present, the
ASSU Senate has life-and-death
power over student money. The

result is gross unfairness in its
distribution, amounting to
taxation without representation.
Most graduate students, for
instance, have supplied the ASSU
with almost half of its funding in
past years, and have received
nothing in return.
2. Approval of the measure
which fixes the percentage of the
budget that is to go to each group,
in the event of approval of a fee
assessment over $0. The ASSU
Senate is the cause of recent
inequities; they must be
circumvented by the students
themselves.
3. Approval of the measure
that would permit student
organizations to bank with
institutions other than the ASSU.
This flagrantly bureaucratic
duplication of effort should no
longer be subsidized by the
University and its students.
4. Implementation of any
program that would make the
Daily independent of the students
and their money. The present
situation of journalism which is
generally mediocre or worse,
coupled with a captive readership,
must be ended.
5. Use of all possible influence
to assure that student members of
University committees represent
the full range of viewpoints on
campus. At present, politics are
virtually the only criterion for
approval by the Senate. This year,
nearly all applicants expressing
conservative or moderate views
have been systematically excluded
from participation. This flagrant
violation of the principle of free
thought, speech, and action at a
university must be stopped.
The tendency at Stanford has
been to overlook or indulge the
seemingly trivial ASSU quarterly
tax. Certainly, $3 per quarter is
not a large sum of money; the size
of the tax, however, does not alter
the principle involved. The power
of student government, like that
of all governments, must be kept
to a bare minimum, and the rights
of the individual must be upheld.
"Ask not what government can
do FOR you ... ask rather what
government is doing TO you."

I am the cows' rights
candidate. I have taken this stand
because cows are the most
oppressed group on this campus.
We must keep in mind that
Stanford University used to be a
farm. When was the last time you
saw a cow walking around, or
grazing in White Plaza? In view of
this, I support the following
demands:
1) Private milking stalls with
curtains, 2) More grass breaks, 3)
A more meaningful farmer
evaluation program, 4) No barn
curfew, 5 ) Cow-ed dorms.
Regarding Stanford University
today, I support the following:
1) Changing the school colors
from red and white to black and
blue.
2) Purchasing some real live
pigs (the ones with tails that go
"oink"), and allowing said pigs to
wallow in the union food.
Whenever riots arise, we can all go

You, the student have expressed many and varied
interests. Some of these concern peace, a cleaner
environment, more equitable opportunities for
women, self-determination for minorities, the
financial situation of the University in relation to
you, and better relations between the ASSU and
yourself.
ASSU as a Student Union
We believe that the ASSU must become a real
Student Union. To do that it must realize that it has
suffered from several misconceptions. One of these
stems from a limited concept of the meaning of
"student interest" and "Stanford Business Office
interests." We feel that many of those who ran
ASSU in the past suffered from a myopic view
because they failed to realize that there are at times,
very real differences between the interests of these
constituencies; that in fact they do not always
coincide.
Therefore, the ASSU should not be a mere
liaison between students and the Administration; it
should not be a means by which an elite of students
accumulate "activity" credits for graduate school in
return for not really serving the interests of
students; and it should never become an arena for
ego conflicts or petty bickering between students.
The purpose of a Student Union is to serve the
student body by attempting to act as an Advocate
of student concerns.
Stanford and the War
We have tangible ideas in terms of those who are
opposed not only to the in Asia, but America's
involvement throughout the world. We propose that
a committee be formed (at least 50 percent students
and community to investigate the entire realm of
the University's investments, to plan a method for
the University to divest itself of those interests and
to reinvest in corporations which better humanity,
not destroy it. We also strongly support the People's
Peace Treaty because we feel that the total cessation
of killing in Vietnam, which the Treaty calls for, is
the only end that is acceptable to those who suffer
the pain and destruction of the war — a war which is
as much racist as it is economic and barbaric.
Woman at Stanford
We would like to see search procedures for aiding
the admission of more women as Undergrads and
Grads, and for the hiring of women faculty and
administrators. And we would like the Day Care
Center better financed so as to accomodate the
children of workers and students without imposing
a financial burden on them.

"kill a pig," and then have a
pleasant meal to boot for our
efforts.
3) Lower Hoover Tower 6 (six)
floors into the ground. This would
eliminate the structural problems,
and would also make the top
more accessible to visitors.
4 ) In spirit of the shortening of
official hames, such as "Flo Mo,"
"Mem Chu," "Hoo Tow," etc., I
propose the following official
abbreviations: a) President of the
University: "Lie Man" b) Member
of the University's ruling class:
"Rus Tee" c) One to be honored
and respected: "Tee Cher."
5) Shorten the unwieldy length
of the name A.S.S.U. Four initials
for such an organization are a bit
much.
I feel that cows' rights have
been unduly neglected, and I will
continue to crusade on their
behalf. A vote for me is a vote to
restore Stanford University to the
great farm that it used to be.

Action in this area is important. Action could be
as minimal as dropping your beer cans and wine
bottles in containers for recycling. An ASSU
recycling program if supported by the students
could earn $15,000 per year. However, we feel it is
equally as important that students develop a wider
view of "so-called environmental responsibility,"
because it is even more important that students
move their institution so it does not have policies
that destroy the resources of mankind.
Minority Affairs
We would like to make clear that we, especially
McHenry and Fields, do not propose to be
spokesmen nor leaders of the various minority
groups. But we as a slate would like to set a
precedent by expressing our support of minority
organizations demands which reflect attempts at
self-determination.
We do not pretend to be super-people. We realize
that these are just the beginnings of an educational
and active process to institute changes. We have no
monopoly on ideas for action, to make a difference,
you the student, must act.
ASSU Referenda
We feel that the present effort to destroy ASSU,
by adopting a $0 assessment is not only directed
toward minority organizations, i.e. BSU, MECHA;
but it also deals directly with the Day Care Center,
Axe Comm, Pompon dollies, and Cardinals Board
which also seek money. We urge you to vote $3 for
the ASSU. Can you really improve ASSU by
destroying it, we do not think so.
Another issue is the credibility of the Senate.
This is being attacked through the arbitrary
assessment of money and reapportionment of the
Senate. We urge you to vote against these referendas
because firstly they are "institutionally racist" and
there has not been adequate debate concerning
whether or not these proposals will actually improve
anything. We feel that you cannot improve the
Senate by taking away its functions; that can only
be done by students taking a more active interest in
Senate elections and issues.
Concept of a "Council"
Finally, we as a council, will function as such.
There will be no One leader for us. The women on
the Council will not just be relegated to "womens
affairs" nor merely serve as a background for the
men on the ticket. The job is too large for any one
person, we will make all decisions together. The End
is Action, not the rhetoric. Vote: McHenry, Fields,
Kimball, Diamond on April 7 and 8.

McWatt turned again, dipped his wings once in salute, decided oh,
well, what the hell, and flew into a mountain. "—CATCH 22
Running for ASSU office feels like flying into a mountain. There
are campus problems connected to national issues that are important
to us that we decided oh, well, what the hell, and took on the label
"candidate" aspects of student elections can only make one shrug
one's shoulders, laugh, and agree "Pooh on ASSU." The fact that
some elements of the election are important does not elevate the rest
above the level of absurdity. To be concerned about a serious issue
does not require one to be serious about the ASSU.
The People's Peace r lYeaty is a serious issue. The treaty and its
implementation can be the beginning of a mass movement to finally
get America out of Southeast Asia.
Women at Stanford are a serious issue. The most pressing need for
women students at Stanford now is in health care. At Cowell Health
Center there is a shortage of gynecological services. It often takes
more than a month to see a Gyn for a routine pelvic exam. Women are
now charged $7.50 for Pap smears, and Planned Parenthood will not
take students under 21. There is little information on VD, whose
symptoms may be masked and are not widely known. More women
psychiatrists are needed since many of the emotional problems
women face stem from unrealistic male expectations of femininity on
an individual and institutional level. And there should be an abortion
counseling service, just as there is draft counselling, to give both sexes
control over their lives and their bodies.
Women in America are a serious issue. In our position paper we
discussed briefly the relationship between the war (and imperialism in
general), racism and sexism. We would hope in the next year to help
people understand how all our struggles are the same struggle as we
take action together.
The Stanford Judicial Council is a serious issue as it relates to
overall campus discipline. The SJC must be replaced with a new
judicial system; it cannot be remedied by mere reform. Increasingly,
there are split votes on crucial decisions with the five faculty
maintaining the majority over the four students. Although all SJC
decisions are recommendations to the President, there is virtually no
hope for a successful appeal since the prosecutor himself is Special
Assistant to the President.
Either all administration actions must be taken through state and
federal courts, or students must have complete control over their own
judicial affairs. Presently, the administration is not using the SJC as an
alternative to the courts (which is the rationale for an internal
system), but in concert with them. Witness the way that the SJC
suspensions were turned into total banishments from campus by the
administration's injunction.
If Stanford is to have an internal system, it must be the following:
