We, as candidates for the ASSU
Presidency, are tired of words
made trite by overuse. We are sick
of the senseless violence abroad
and at home and the harm it has
done to the Stanford community.
As a team we will work to
represent the desire of this
community for peace in Vietnam,
for a University land policy that
considers needs for housing and
open space, and especially a
student government that
represents the broad interests of
students than the special interests
of pressure groups.
