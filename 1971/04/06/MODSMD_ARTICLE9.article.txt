# Senior Class Officers
## 
### 
More seniors will go on to work immediately
after graduation this year before entering graduate
school (if they so choose) than in several years. This
trend is expected to continue with the class of
1972.
We feel that this calls for changes in the Stanford
curriculum. The University must respond to the
students' changing needs. More courses must be
organized soon to prepare seniors for jobs
immediately upon graduation. Too often seniors
fear that they have no employable skills when they
graduate.
The knowledge that one is employable upon
graduation will free seniors to do what they want.
As senior class officers we would push for
changes that would allow students this freedom.
We feel that it is important for senior class
officers to represent the broad spectrum of views
within the class and to communicate these to
alumni, other students, faculty and administration.
As officers we would dedicate ourselves to
increasing communication with alumni and
potential employers of Stanford
students—encouraging students to go out and talk to
alumni about jobs. The Dean of Students Office is
currently sending students to talk to alumni in
Southern California about summer jobs. We would
pressure the administration and the Placement
Center to search more diligently for jobs for
graduating seniors, (-specially in this time of a job
shortage.
If elected, we would express to alumni and
Stanford visitors student's views of the war, the
environment, racial problems, fair housing for all,

Miller, Fitzsimmons, Wernick

and other concerns.
We pledge to continue and make the Happy Hour
Happier than ever and to attempt to make the
traditional commencement day ceremonies more
relevant today. We feel the Commencement should
be something that graduating seniors want to attend
as a culmination of their years at Stanford. All too
often, we feel, seniors only attend because their
parents want them to.
Too often the job of the Senior Class officers has
been neglected, in fact, several thousand dollars
have accumulated in the Senior Class treasury over
the past several years which could be used to search
for jobs for seniors, to organize a job fair for
graduating seniors and potential employers, to
encourage University and student recycling efforts,
perhaps to organize some anti-war activity, perhaps
to bring such speakers as Ralph Nader or Ramsey
Clark.
Regardless of what is attempted, however, an
attempt will be made to contact as many seniors as
possible for their ideas and suggestions. We want to
represent the senior class above all else.
Frank Miller, presidential candidate, an English
major, has worked for the Daily for three years and
is a former news editor. He currently is a part-time
reporter for the New York Times.
Stacey Fitzsimmons, vice-presidential candidate,
a history major, has been extremely active in
Conservation Club activities for several years and is
currently a club coordinator. She recently organized
the Stanford Recycle Day.
Allan Wernick, a Political Science major, is a
former candidate for ASSI! president.

Far too often elections for senior class offices
have not been taken seriously at Stanford. As a
consequence, ballots have many times been
cluttered with the names of compulsive politis and
transparent opportunists.
The joint candidacy of Cece Mcßoskey, Allen
Meredith, and Claude Terry marks a significant
departure from this pattern. They are not politicians
— rather, they are a qualified and serious-minded
group of students intent on establishing an
innovative and smoothly-functioning senior class
administration. They represent no selfish interests,
no cliques, and no single political ideology — only
the interests of the senior class.
The ticket is less concerned with the hollow
processes of real politik and the plastic bureaucratic
functions of political dormancy than they are with
utilizing class government to answer the real
problems and desires of seniors. Their efforts will
extend far beyond the usual "happy hour"
preparations and administrative paperwork; as a
uniquely organized unit, they will be confronting
the meaningful problems usually left untouched by
class government.
Meredith, Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey believe
that senior class government must work to improve
relations with Stanford alumni. With unemployment
levels now at crisis levels in many portions of the
country, a great number of seniors will have
difficulty in procuring post-graduate employment.
If elected, the ticket promises to launch a concerted
campaign aimed at obtaining jobs for graduating
seniors from alumni employers. Meredith, Terry,
Stevens and Mcßoskey feel singularly competent to
handle this task since, as a group, they have had
experience with the Stanford Management Intern
Program, fraternity alumni contacts, and booster
club affairs throughout the state.

Meredith, Terry, Stevens, Mcßoskey

Along with pursuing more intimate dealings with
alumni, the ticket will also attack the deteriorating
quality of student-faculty relations. One of
Stanford's more unfor. jnate growing pains has been
the paucity of contacts between seniors and their
instructors. Many seniors leave Stanford without
having been on personal terms with a single
professor. In many instances, recommendations for
graduate study have been impossible to acquire. But
still more significantly, there has been a concurrent
decline in the kind of personalized education
offered at Stanford.
Because of crippled organization and inadequate
publicity, senior activities have most often not even
been attended by the very students who finance
them. This must change. Mcltoskey, Meredith,
Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey will bring to office a
carefully departmentalized and coordinated
administrative structure capable of grappling with
organizational difficulties expeditiously and
efficiently. Although only three names will appear
on the ballot due to election regulations, the
administration will include four members, each
operating in a specific area: Cece Mcßoskey will be
charged with social planning; Allen Meredith will be
responsible for financial matters; Jack Stevens will
function as a liaison with the faculty, and Claude
Terry will work with the alumni.
This must he the year that class government
comes of political maturity. This must be the year
that senior class government becomes more than
just a bureaucratic game or an opportunistic
pastime. Mcßoskey, Meredith, Stevens, and Terry
represent a concerned cross-section who care about
Stanford and Stanford students. Help transform
senior government into the dynamic fore it is

former candidate for ASSI! president.

Far too often elections for senior class offices
have not been taken seriously at Stanford. As a
consequence, ballots have many times been
cluttered with the names of compulsive politis and
transparent opportunists.
The joint candidacy of Cece Mcßoskey, Allen
Meredith, and Claude Terry marks a significant
departure from this pattern. They are not politicians
— rather, they are a qualified and serious-minded
group of students intent on establishing an
innovative and smoothly-functioning senior class
administration. They represent no selfish interests,
no cliques, and no single political ideology — only
the interests of the senior class.
The ticket is less concerned with the hollow
processes of real politik and the plastic bureaucratic
functions of political dormancy than they are with
utilizing class government to answer the real
problems and desires of seniors. Their efforts will
extend far beyond the usual "happy hour"
preparations and administrative paperwork; as a
uniquely organized unit, they will be confronting
the meaningful problems usually left untouched by
class government.
Meredith, Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey believe
that senior class government must work to improve
relations with Stanford alumni. With unemployment
levels now at crisis levels in many portions of the
country, a great number of seniors will have
difficulty in procuring post-graduate employment.
If elected, the ticket promises to launch a concerted
campaign aimed at obtaining jobs for graduating
seniors from alumni employers. Meredith, Terry,
Stevens and Mcßoskey feel singularly competent to
handle this task since, as a group, they have had
experience with the Stanford Management Intern
Program, fraternity alumni contacts, and booster
club affairs throughout the state.

Meredith, Terry, Stevens, Mcßoskey

Along with pursuing more intimate dealings with
alumni, the ticket will also attack the deteriorating
quality of student-faculty relations. One of
Stanford's more unfor. jnate growing pains has been
the paucity of contacts between seniors and their
instructors. Many seniors leave Stanford without
having been on personal terms with a single
professor. In many instances, recommendations for
graduate study have been impossible to acquire. But
still more significantly, there has been a concurrent
decline in the kind of personalized education
offered at Stanford.
Because of crippled organization and inadequate
publicity, senior activities have most often not even
been attended by the very students who finance
them. This must change. Mcltoskey, Meredith,
Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey will bring to office a
carefully departmentalized and coordinated
administrative structure capable of grappling with
organizational difficulties expeditiously and
efficiently. Although only three names will appear
on the ballot due to election regulations, the
administration will include four members, each
operating in a specific area: Cece Mcßoskey will be
charged with social planning; Allen Meredith will be
responsible for financial matters; Jack Stevens will
function as a liaison with the faculty, and Claude
Terry will work with the alumni.
This must he the year that class government
comes of political maturity. This must be the year
that senior class government becomes more than
just a bureaucratic game or an opportunistic
pastime. Mcßoskey, Meredith, Stevens, and Terry
represent a concerned cross-section who care about
Stanford and Stanford students. Help transform
senior government into the dynamic fore it is
capable of fulfilling
More seniors will go on to work immediately
after graduation this year before entering graduate
school (if they so choose) than in several years. This
trend is expected to continue with the class of
1972.
We feel that this calls for changes in the Stanford
curriculum. The University must respond to the
students' changing needs. More courses must be
organized soon to prepare seniors for jobs
immediately upon graduation. Too often seniors
fear that they have no employable skills when they
graduate.
The knowledge that one is employable upon
graduation will free seniors to do what they want.
As senior class officers we would push for
changes that would allow students this freedom.
We feel that it is important for senior class
officers to represent the broad spectrum of views
within the class and to communicate these to
alumni, other students, faculty and administration.
As officers we would dedicate ourselves to
increasing communication with alumni and
potential employers of Stanford
students—encouraging students to go out and talk to
alumni about jobs. The Dean of Students Office is
currently sending students to talk to alumni in
Southern California about summer jobs. We would
pressure the administration and the Placement
Center to search more diligently for jobs for
graduating seniors, (-specially in this time of a job
shortage.
If elected, we would express to alumni and
Stanford visitors student's views of the war, the
environment, racial problems, fair housing for all,

Miller, Fitzsimmons, Wernick

and other concerns.
We pledge to continue and make the Happy Hour
Happier than ever and to attempt to make the
traditional commencement day ceremonies more
relevant today. We feel the Commencement should
be something that graduating seniors want to attend
as a culmination of their years at Stanford. All too
often, we feel, seniors only attend because their
parents want them to.
Too often the job of the Senior Class officers has
been neglected, in fact, several thousand dollars
have accumulated in the Senior Class treasury over
the past several years which could be used to search
for jobs for seniors, to organize a job fair for
graduating seniors and potential employers, to
encourage University and student recycling efforts,
perhaps to organize some anti-war activity, perhaps
to bring such speakers as Ralph Nader or Ramsey
Clark.
Regardless of what is attempted, however, an
attempt will be made to contact as many seniors as
possible for their ideas and suggestions. We want to
represent the senior class above all else.

function as a liaison with the faculty, and Claude
Terry will work with the alumni.
This must he the year that class government

that senior class government becomes more than

More seniors will go on to work immediately
after graduation this year before entering graduate
school (if they so choose) than in several years. This
trend is expected to continue with the class of
1972.
We feel that this calls for changes in the Stanford
curriculum. The University must respond to the
students' changing needs. More courses must be
organized soon to prepare seniors for jobs
immediately upon graduation. Too often seniors
fear that they have no employable skills when they
graduate.
The knowledge that one is employable upon
graduation will free seniors to do what they want.
As senior class officers we would push for
changes that would allow students this freedom.
We feel that it is important for senior class
officers to represent the broad spectrum of views
within the class and to communicate these to
alumni, other students, faculty and administration.
As officers we would dedicate ourselves to
increasing communication with alumni and
potential employers of Stanford
students—encouraging students to go out and talk to
alumni about jobs. The Dean of Students Office is
currently sending students to talk to alumni in
Southern California about summer jobs. We would
pressure the administration and the Placement
Center to search more diligently for jobs for
graduating seniors, (-specially in this time of a job
shortage.
If elected, we would express to alumni and
Stanford visitors student's views of the war, the
environment, racial problems, fair housing for all,

Miller, Fitzsimmons, Wernick

and other concerns.
We pledge to continue and make the Happy Hour
Happier than ever and to attempt to make the
traditional commencement day ceremonies more
relevant today. We feel the Commencement should
be something that graduating seniors want to attend
as a culmination of their years at Stanford. All too
often, we feel, seniors only attend because their
parents want them to.
Too often the job of the Senior Class officers has
been neglected, in fact, several thousand dollars
have accumulated in the Senior Class treasury over
the past several years which could be used to search
for jobs for seniors, to organize a job fair for
graduating seniors and potential employers, to
encourage University and student recycling efforts,
perhaps to organize some anti-war activity, perhaps
to bring such speakers as Ralph Nader or Ramsey
Clark.
Regardless of what is attempted, however, an
attempt will be made to contact as many seniors as
possible for their ideas and suggestions. We want to
represent the senior class above all else.
Frank Miller, presidential candidate, an English
major, has worked for the Daily for three years and
is a former news editor. He currently is a part-time
reporter for the New York Times.
Stacey Fitzsimmons, vice-presidential candidate,
a history major, has been extremely active in
Conservation Club activities for several years and is
currently a club coordinator. She recently organized
the Stanford Recycle Day.
Allan Wernick, a Political Science major, is a
former candidate for ASSI! president.

Far too often elections for senior class offices
have not been taken seriously at Stanford. As a
consequence, ballots have many times been
cluttered with the names of compulsive politis and
transparent opportunists.
The joint candidacy of Cece Mcßoskey, Allen
Meredith, and Claude Terry marks a significant
departure from this pattern. They are not politicians
— rather, they are a qualified and serious-minded
group of students intent on establishing an
innovative and smoothly-functioning senior class
administration. They represent no selfish interests,
no cliques, and no single political ideology — only
the interests of the senior class.
The ticket is less concerned with the hollow
processes of real politik and the plastic bureaucratic
functions of political dormancy than they are with
utilizing class government to answer the real
problems and desires of seniors. Their efforts will
extend far beyond the usual "happy hour"
preparations and administrative paperwork; as a
uniquely organized unit, they will be confronting
the meaningful problems usually left untouched by
class government.
Meredith, Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey believe
that senior class government must work to improve
relations with Stanford alumni. With unemployment
levels now at crisis levels in many portions of the
country, a great number of seniors will have
difficulty in procuring post-graduate employment.
If elected, the ticket promises to launch a concerted
campaign aimed at obtaining jobs for graduating
seniors from alumni employers. Meredith, Terry,
Stevens and Mcßoskey feel singularly competent to
handle this task since, as a group, they have had
experience with the Stanford Management Intern
Program, fraternity alumni contacts, and booster
club affairs throughout the state.

Meredith, Terry, Stevens, Mcßoskey

Along with pursuing more intimate dealings with
alumni, the ticket will also attack the deteriorating
quality of student-faculty relations. One of
Stanford's more unfor. jnate growing pains has been
the paucity of contacts between seniors and their
instructors. Many seniors leave Stanford without
having been on personal terms with a single
professor. In many instances, recommendations for
graduate study have been impossible to acquire. But
still more significantly, there has been a concurrent
decline in the kind of personalized education
offered at Stanford.
Because of crippled organization and inadequate
publicity, senior activities have most often not even
been attended by the very students who finance
them. This must change. Mcltoskey, Meredith,
Terry, Stevens, and Mcßoskey will bring to office a
carefully departmentalized and coordinated
administrative structure capable of grappling with
organizational difficulties expeditiously and
efficiently. Although only three names will appear
on the ballot due to election regulations, the
administration will include four members, each
operating in a specific area: Cece Mcßoskey will be
charged with social planning; Allen Meredith will be
responsible for financial matters; Jack Stevens will
function as a liaison with the faculty, and Claude
Terry will work with the alumni.
