# Coladarci-Educational Enthusiast

### JANE CORRIGAN 
"1 assumed that when President Lyman named me
as dean, 1 would immediately have all sorts of wisdom
and speak with great profundity," says Arthur
Coladarci, recently named head of the School of
Education. "So far Fm still waiting."
Warm, outgoing, and relaxed in his spacious and
elegant office, Dean Coladarci brings an almost
boundless enthusiasm for his faculty, school and
university to his newly acquired post, combined with
great optimism about the results of the changes which
he sees taking place at Stanford and in his own
department.
Rather than waiting for change to take place in its
own time, Coladarci has chosen to initiate it, by
creating a Futures Committee to investigate all
aspects of the School of Education in order to
determine what improvements can be made in the
school's use of its resources and what shifts in
direction should be made. The Committee is
composed of four professors and a doctoral
candidate, all elected by the faculty of the school,
and is expected to report back to the faculty this
June.
Dean Coladarci feels that the Stanford School of
Education is one of the strongest in the U.S., if not
the world, and sees the Futures Committee as one
way of ensuring the continuation of that
preeminence. "We have not looked closely at
ourselves for a long time, since 1959, and since then
the world has changed in many ways. There are things
we should be doing that we are not, and things that
we are doing that we should not be. The faculty is
going to have to look at themselves, their school, and
the emerging future. There have been changes in the
university, the profession of teaching, the social
fabric of society, and 1 presume that these changes
have profound implications for us. The future has
arrived ahead of schedule, and we have to think about
our strengths and our posture."
Part of the role of the committee is to help
determine the best priorities for the school's limited

resources, which, like all Stanford departments, are in
the process of being BAPped. Coladarci views the
work of the BAP Committee as being constructive,
helping the various departments to be more efficient
in their allocation of resources as well as more
economical. "I have a strong feeling that BAP will
leave the university as a whole much and
this holds true for the School of Educate as well.
We have had to pay attention to economy, but have
never been under such pressure to see if we are
making the best use of our resources. We now need to
raise much harder questions about ourselves and our
priorities."
Faculty Asset
Dean Coladarci is most enthusiastic about the
abilities of his faculty to adjust to the changes of BAP
and those which will follow their discussion of the
report of the Futures Committee, and sees the 40
faculty members of the school as its greatest asset,
His high opinion of them plays a great part in shaping
his view of the role which he must play as Dean of
the School of Education.
"In some other institutions, I would argue that the
Dean should map out policy, and then try to
persuade the faculty. At Stanford, we have an
extremely strong faculty, which is experienced and
brilliant, many of whom are the best in their fields. I
see my posture as one of making sure that they
communicate, discuss, and let their intelligence be
felt.
"And not only are they very competent and
productive, but they are very sensitive to the
relationship between education and the development
of the community. There have been many
innovations developed here, and what new notions
don't derive from the faculty are heard about and
acted on pretty fast."
Minority Students
One aspect of the School of Education's
operations of which he :s particularly proud is its
ability to attract and keep minority students, whom

he feels are attracted to the field of education by the
possibilities of making a direct impact on the world
through education. This same feeling of altruism and
interest on the part of undergraduates has prompted
him to reconsider the role which they might possibly
play in the school.
"We would like to capitalize on the patent interest
of undergraduates in education, to make it possible
for them to learn about the problems of education
without entering the profession, to become
sophisticated and critical of the contemporary
education scene."
The School of Education as it has traditionally
operated serves not to train teachers, but to train
professors of education and administrators. The STEP
program (Stanford Teacher Education Program),
which does turn out a small number of teachers at the
college and secondary school levels, is designed
mainly to provide a workshop for experiments in
teacher-training theory, which leads to further study
and the dissemination of the results of these
experiments. Coladarci feels that a return to the
operation of a similar program on the elementary
level would be highly desirable, but that the
possibilities of such a change are limited.
"We are charged with maintaining certain
programs of study and certain research committments
and emphases, and we also share a series of problems
with the University, one of which is finding ways to
support our students in an increasingly expensive
institution. We can only do so many things at once
with our limited resources, and although there's no
question of the desirability of an experimental
elementary program, there is the question of where it
fits in the priorities of alternatives."
Dean Coladarci has been involved with Stanford
since 1952, when he came here from the University
of Indiana, and has held a number of posts within the
university, including the directorship of SIDEC

Corporation) and the associate deanship of the
School of Education. He had been serving as acting
dean since September. This long association with a
professional graduate school has led him to consider
the relationship such a school has to the university as
a whole, particularly the schools of Humanities +
Science and other professional schools. The School of
Education has a system of joint appointments in
operation with the departments of psychology,
anthropology, sociology, and the Business School,
and its dean sees even more cooperation among the
graduate schools in the future.
"The question of the relationship of any
professional school with the rest of the university is a
very current one which the university must face, and
we are very lucky in having both a provost and a
president who are interested in the professional
schools and these kinds of questions. Right now, we
have some very nice working relationships which I
would not want for a moment to destroy, and I think
that they will be extended."
Coladarci is unqualified in his approval of Stanford
and his own position within the university. "I have
nothing but enthusiasm, and I'm very optimistic
about what is going to happen to the university and
the School of Education. The only bias I have never
given up is the committment to rational process. As
long as it is used and insisted on, we will all come out
strong and well, as long as there is a free flow of ideas,
a free expression of ideas, no hammerlocks put on
intelligence. Stanford University is functioning that
way now, and its president is committed that way,
with an insistence on rational fair process and
procedures, uncoerced discussion and solution of
problems. And as long as things stay that way, and I
think they will, we'll all be all right."
