# Ecology House: A Mini Eco-System
## 
### WALLY THURSTON 
The financial woes of many
Stanford fraternities are currently
paving the way for new
experimental living groups on
campus.
One proposal that recently
gained approval by the Dean of
Housing lays out the foundations
for an Ecology House here. The
50 members of the new living
group will occupy the I)EK House
in the Cowell frat cluster, next
fall. Present DEK house residents
will move to Mayfield house on
the row next year.
The Ecology House, envisioned
to be an experiment in Residential
Education, has been in the works
for more than a year.
Spurred on by I)r. Robert
Madix, a Univeristy Fellow
(Chemical Engineering), and the
experience of last summer's
Ecology Theme House in Soto, a
group of students met regularly
Fall and Winter quarters to draw
up the house proposal.
Three Areas
According to the proposal, the
house will cover three areas of
activity: House seminars and
ecology projects; a group
reassessment of living habits, and
a great deal of interaction with
other ecology organizations in the
Bay Area.
"The Ecology House is
intended to bring together
students with diverse interests to
study the economic, political
and technological aspects of the
environmental problem and to
begin to effect solutions," states
the proposal.
"The interaction among house
members through their interests in
these problems will transcend the
usual interdisciplinary approach,"
says Madix, House sponsor.
"Members of the house will
have to have a pretty strong
commitment," emphasizes one of
the originators, Vince Siciliano.
"Environmental Bullshit"
"We want to take a lot of the
environmental bullshit that's

going around and give it a hard
look at: confront it with our own
values, and see what compromises
we have to make," said Siciliano.
According to the proposal,
members of the House will have
to take a two unit pass-fail house
core seminar, in addition to three
other units in the field of ecology.
The latter could be taken as a
regular University course or in a
special house course. These
requirements are not rigid,
however.
Professor Sanford Dornbusch
(Sociology), John Gurley
(Economics) and Irwin Remson
(Environmental Earth Sciences),
are among those who have
expressed interest in advising
house courses. Many others are
being approached.
After Fall quarter, the
residents may modify the unit
commitment and content of the
courses. So far some of the
proposed house seminars are:
Recycling, Nutritional Systems
Planning, Environmental Politics
and Law, Biological Ecosystems,
Energy and Resources Planning,
Physical Functionalities and the
Scientific Method, and
Environmental Perception.
"Through the seminars we
hope to synthesize all the fields
related to the environment into
one common discipline," says
co-author Steve Colome.
