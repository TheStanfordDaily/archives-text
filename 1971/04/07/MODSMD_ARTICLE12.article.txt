# Law Review Head Selected
## 
### 
Allen M. Katz, a Phi Beta
Kappa graduate of Brandeis
University has been chosen
president of the Stanford Law
Review for 1 9 71 -72.
Katz received the Hilmer
Oehlmann award for research and
writing last year and has been
active with the Legal Aid Society,
working one day a week writing
pleadings and interviewing clients
in the domestic relations section.

According to the proposal, the
house itself will be treated as an
eco-system and will be subject to
experimentation. Students taking
the above courses will be involved
in house energy and waste
monitoring, as well as food
planning.
Although the house hopes to
receive some funding from the
University Fellows Innovation
Fund, it will be managed and
operated by students. Planners
hope to coordinate food cooking
and buying with Columbae House,
next door.
"Obviously there is a great deal
of planning to do," says Junior
Sue Campbell. "We need to get
interested people involved in
specific planning." House
finances, curriculum and

government haven't been planned
yet. "Once we get things going,
we may need a lot of re-evaluation
and changes," adds Vince
Siciliano.
The sex ratio is hoped to 1 :1
"So that the House will be
self-perpetuation." Initially there
will be the following approximate
major distribution: Graduate
students 26%, Engineering,
Sciences and Earth Sciences 25%,
Humanities 10%, Social Sciences
25%, General Studies 10% and
special programs 15%.
The house will have its normal
quota of resident assistants and
sponsors who will double as house
managers, at least initially.
Membership selection will be
through the University draw, once
the initial group is set up.

During the Summer, an
ecology theme house will carry
out experiments in house
government and project design
that will aid the Fall group.
Although all the house projects
will be hard to start right away,
the proposal writers hope
activities will grow through a
program of self-evaluation. Much
of the house work can be
measured in terms of research
papers, experimental projects and
reduce house consumption.
According to Bemie Trilling,
"The proposal sounds fairly
structured, but that's just to get
the house started. Essentially,
those who become involved will
shape the course in the future."
