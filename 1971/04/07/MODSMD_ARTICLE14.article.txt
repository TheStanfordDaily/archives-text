# Stanford's Laxmen Edged By Midshipmen
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford lacrosse team
came from two goals behind to
overtake the Naval Post Graduate
School, 9-8, in triple overtime last
Saturday at Monterey. The win
sets the stage for the Cards' game
against the Palo Alto lacrosse club
on Saturday. The winner of that
game will clinch first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association.
In last weekend's action against
the Navy grads the Indian attack
was led by sophomore Butch
Hazelett who scored five goals,
including the winner. Single tallies
were added by Tom Kidde, Paul
Tittmann, Paul Yuell, and Dave
Anderson.
The NPGS opened the scoring
but Stanford, playing tough
defense with good goal tending by
Fred Choate, led at halftime, 4-3.
The Indians showed a
well-executed ride-on clear that
allowed the Card stickmen to
control the ball.
After a scoreless third quarter
the NPCS came back to tie the
game at 5-5. Prickett of the
midshipmen scored two more
goals putting the hosts ahead 7-5
with less than two minutes
remaining in the game.
However, the Cards broke up a
Navy clear and Tom Kidde picked
up the loose ball. He beat his man
and drilled a shot behind the
NPCS netminder, who had
stymied Stanford on several
occasions earlier in the afternoon.

Paul Tittmann won the face-off
following Kidde's goal, weaved his
way into enemy territory, and
fired a shot that skipped into the
net, sending the game into
overtime.
In the first overtime period,
neither team could score. In the
second overtime, the two teams
traded goals. With the score tied,
the two teams agreed to play the
next period as sudden death.
Hazelett Scores Winner
After a little more than a
minute, Butch Hazelett put home
the winning goal, his fifth of the
afternoon, and Stanford had
chalked up their second win of
the season. The Card laxmen have
lost only one game—to Air Force,
6-3. The Stanford lacrosse team is
presently tied for first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association. Their next game is on
Saturday against the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club. The game "will
decide in all probability the league
champion," according to Stanford
lacrosse coach Bill Eakland.
The Palo Alto club has two
strong victories over San
Francisco and Golden Gate under
their belt. The Palo Alto stickmen
haven't won the league
championship in four years. They
should be hungry for the Indians,
who are the league's defending
champions.
The two teams face off at 1
p.m. at the Stanford lacrosse field
located between the tennis courts
and Maples Pavillion.


TROY FALLS—Gery Groslimond, one of the three top-flight
sophomores on the tennis team, helped the Indians halt USC's
twelve-year domination over Stanford last Friday by teaming with
Rick Fisher in winning their all-important second doubles match, 5-7,
6-4,13-11. The Indians downed the Trojans, 6-3.

control the ball.
After a scoreless third quarter
the NPCS came back to tie the
game at 5-5. Prickett of the
midshipmen scored two more
goals putting the hosts ahead 7-5
with less than two minutes
remaining in the game.
However, the Cards broke up a
Navy clear and Tom Kidde picked
up the loose ball. He beat his man
and drilled a shot behind the
NPCS netminder, who had
stymied Stanford on several
occasions earlier in the afternoon.

Paul Tittmann won the face-off
following Kidde's goal, weaved his
way into enemy territory, and
fired a shot that skipped into the
net, sending the game into
overtime.
In the first overtime period,
neither team could score. In the
second overtime, the two teams
traded goals. With the score tied,
the two teams agreed to play the
next period as sudden death.
Hazelett Scores Winner
After a little more than a
minute, Butch Hazelett put home
the winning goal, his fifth of the
afternoon, and Stanford had
chalked up their second win of
the season. The Card laxmen have
lost only one game—to Air Force,
6-3. The Stanford lacrosse team is
presently tied for first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association. Their next game is on
Saturday against the Palo Alto
Lacrosse Club. The game "will
decide in all probability the league
champion," according to Stanford
lacrosse coach Bill Eakland.
The Palo Alto club has two
strong victories over San
Francisco and Golden Gate under
their belt. The Palo Alto stickmen
haven't won the league
championship in four years. They
should be hungry for the Indians,
who are the league's defending
champions.
The two teams face off at 1
p.m. at the Stanford lacrosse field
located between the tennis courts
and Maples Pavillion.


TROY FALLS—Gery Groslimond, one of the three top-flight
sophomores on the tennis team, helped the Indians halt USC's
twelve-year domination over Stanford last Friday by teaming with
Rick Fisher in winning their all-important second doubles match, 5-7,
6-4,13-11. The Indians downed the Trojans, 6-3.
The Stanford lacrosse team
came from two goals behind to
overtake the Naval Post Graduate
School, 9-8, in triple overtime last
Saturday at Monterey. The win
sets the stage for the Cards' game
against the Palo Alto lacrosse club
on Saturday. The winner of that
game will clinch first place in the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association.
In last weekend's action against
the Navy grads the Indian attack
was led by sophomore Butch
Hazelett who scored five goals,
including the winner. Single tallies
were added by Tom Kidde, Paul
Tittmann, Paul Yuell, and Dave
Anderson.
The NPGS opened the scoring
but Stanford, playing tough
defense with good goal tending by
Fred Choate, led at halftime, 4-3.
The Indians showed a
well-executed ride-on clear that
allowed the Card stickmen to
control the ball.
