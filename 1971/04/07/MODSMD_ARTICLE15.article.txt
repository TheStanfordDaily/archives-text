# Schoen Wins Third
## Cards Clip Chico 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford expanded its season
log to 22-10-1 yesterday at
Sunken Diamond by clipping
Chico State 5-1. Starter Brian
Schoen went all the way to pick
up his third victory of the year in
as many decisions.
Schoen gave up six hits and
one unearned run in the victory.
After retiring the first thirteen
batters in a row, Schoen, gave up
three hits in four innings before a
three-hit attack in the ninth
nearly sparked a Chico State rally.
Schoen struck out three men
and walked none. He now boasts a
sub-one earned run average and
better than a strike out per inning.
Chico opened the scoring with
an unearned tally in the fifth. The
Indians countered with a
three-run bottom half of the fifth.
Second-sacker Dave Edson
scrambled to first on an error,
advanced to second on a balk, and
was sacrificed to third on a fly
ball.

Rod Boone walked and made it
to third on a double by Mark
Lucich, scoring Edson. Boone
tagged home on a ground out by
third baseman Fat Rusco. Lucich
finally completed his circuit on a
double by right fielder Bob
Marshall.
The Indians struck again in the
seventh to increase the lead to
4-1. Dick Borchers walked, and
was knocked home by Lucich on
his second run-producing double
of the afternoon.
In the eighth frame, the Cards
iced the contest with another
score. Catcher Boh Reece started
with a single, followed by singles
from Edson and Boone with
Reece scoring.
Rod Boone's eighth-inning hit
kept alive his 13-game hitting
streak.
Averaging over .40 0 for the
year and leading the team in every
department except stolen bases,
Reece has batted in 30 runs in 33
games.


MOVIN' OUTâ€”UCLA captain Wayne Collett, ranked third in the
world in the 440 yard dash and 400 yard intermediate hurdles, will
help life difficult for Stanford tracksters this week-end at UCLA.
