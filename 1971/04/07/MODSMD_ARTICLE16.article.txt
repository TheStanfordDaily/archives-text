# Indians Face UCLA Saturday
## Oregon Crushes Trackmen 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's varsity track team
was humbled by Oregon, 106-39,
at Eugene last Saturday in its first
Pacific-8 competition of the 1971
season.
Coach Fay ton Jordan's
trackmen will try and rebound
from their stunning defeat by one
of the nation's strongest track
squads this Saturday when they
meet a powerful UCLA team in
Los Angeles.
The Indians had hoped to
challenge Oregon's Steve
Prefontaine and his teammates in
the long distance events. This
effort failed and Stanford picked
up most of its 39 point total from
outstanding performances by
Allen Meredith, Randy White,
Rick Tipton, and Casey Carrigan.
Al Meredith missed all of
Stanford's early spring practices
while he was attending Stanford
in France. Displaying a
remarkably rapid return to form,
Meredith won the triple jump at
Oregon with a leap of 4 9-5.
Meredith is approaching his
lifetime best jump of 52-3, and
appears capable of defending his
1971 Pac-8 triple jump crown.
Randy White and Tom Long
took first and second places in the
4 4 0 yard intermediate hurdles for
the Cards. Wfliite, who has already
equalled his all-time Stanford
record of 51.3 in the hurdles this
year, turned in a 51.6 time at
Oregon to defeat the nearest
Webfoot by three seconds.
Record For Tipton
Rick Tipton set a new Stanford
record in the 120 yard high
hurdles with a time of 13.6,
bettering his old record by a tenth
of a second. ITie Indian
speedster's time also established a
new Oregon-Stanford meet
record. Long placed third for
Stanford with a time of 14.2 .
1 968 Olympian, Casey
Carrigan, took first for the Indians
in the pole vault with a 15-6
performance. Carrigan has vaulted
16-7 this year and is showing the
form that enabled him to jump
over 1 7-4 two years ago.
Except for four outstanding
individuals, Stanford's trackmen
could not take any firsts from the
overpowering Oregon team. Only
Steve Davis in the discus seriously

challenged his Oregon opponents
as he took second with a toss of
169-1 1 .
Steve Prefontaine provided the
highlight of the meet as he ran the
second fastest time for the three
mile event in United States track
history. His time of 13:01.5 was
just 8.5 seconds off former
Olympian, (Jerry Lindgren's Am
erican record.
Arvid Kretz bested his lifetime
record of 13:58 in the three mile
run by 27 seconds, but even this
amazing performance fell far
behind Prefontaine's blistering
pace. Don Kardong finished third
for Stanford with a time of
13:34.4.
UCLA Poses Problems
Stanford's drubbing at Eugene
does nothing to brighten the
outlook for this weekend's meet
at UCLA. The Bruins won the
Pac-8 Championship last year and
finished seventh in the NCAA
meet.
UCLA boasts the two fastest
quarter milers of the 19 70 season

in Wayne Collett and John Smith.
Stanford will have a difficult time
besting the talented Bruin
sprinters, but the Cards should
challenge UCLA in the distance
events. Stanford soundly defeated
the Bruins last fall in cross
country and Kretz and Kardong
should dominate the distance
events this Saturday.
UCLA has already beaten a
strong Kansas track squad this
spring, 84-71, and also ravaged a
competent Tennessee team. These
victories indicate that UCLA
should prove to be a national
power again this year. Coach
Jordan's trackmen will have to
turn in their best performances if
the team is to avenge last year's
defeat when they travel to Los
Angeles this weekend.

turn in their best performances if
the team is to avenge last year's
defeat when they travel to Los
Angeles this weekend.
Stanford's varsity track team
was humbled by Oregon, 106-39,
at Eugene last Saturday in its first
Pacific-8 competition of the 1971
season.
Coach Fay ton Jordan's
trackmen will try and rebound
from their stunning defeat by one
of the nation's strongest track
squads this Saturday when they
meet a powerful UCLA team in
Los Angeles.
The Indians had hoped to
challenge Oregon's Steve
Prefontaine and his teammates in
the long distance events. This
effort failed and Stanford picked
up most of its 39 point total from
outstanding performances by
Allen Meredith, Randy White,
Rick Tipton, and Casey Carrigan.
Al Meredith missed all of
Stanford's early spring practices
while he was attending Stanford
in France. Displaying a
remarkably rapid return to form,
Meredith won the triple jump at
Oregon with a leap of 4 9-5.
Meredith is approaching his
lifetime best jump of 52-3, and
appears capable of defending his
1971 Pac-8 triple jump crown.
Randy White and Tom Long
took first and second places in the
4 4 0 yard intermediate hurdles for
the Cards. Wfliite, who has already
equalled his all-time Stanford
record of 51.3 in the hurdles this
year, turned in a 51.6 time at
Oregon to defeat the nearest
Webfoot by three seconds.
Record For Tipton
Rick Tipton set a new Stanford
record in the 120 yard high
hurdles with a time of 13.6,
bettering his old record by a tenth
of a second. ITie Indian
speedster's time also established a
new Oregon-Stanford meet
record. Long placed third for
Stanford with a time of 14.2 .
1 968 Olympian, Casey
Carrigan, took first for the Indians
in the pole vault with a 15-6
performance. Carrigan has vaulted
16-7 this year and is showing the
form that enabled him to jump
over 1 7-4 two years ago.
Except for four outstanding
individuals, Stanford's trackmen
could not take any firsts from the
overpowering Oregon team. Only
Steve Davis in the discus seriously

challenged his Oregon opponents
as he took second with a toss of
169-1 1 .
Steve Prefontaine provided the
highlight of the meet as he ran the
second fastest time for the three
mile event in United States track
history. His time of 13:01.5 was
just 8.5 seconds off former
Olympian, (Jerry Lindgren's Am
erican record.
Arvid Kretz bested his lifetime
record of 13:58 in the three mile
run by 27 seconds, but even this
amazing performance fell far
behind Prefontaine's blistering
pace. Don Kardong finished third
for Stanford with a time of
13:34.4.
UCLA Poses Problems
Stanford's drubbing at Eugene
does nothing to brighten the
outlook for this weekend's meet
at UCLA. The Bruins won the
Pac-8 Championship last year and
finished seventh in the NCAA
meet.
UCLA boasts the two fastest
quarter milers of the 19 70 season

in Wayne Collett and John Smith.
Stanford will have a difficult time
besting the talented Bruin
sprinters, but the Cards should
challenge UCLA in the distance
events. Stanford soundly defeated
the Bruins last fall in cross
country and Kretz and Kardong
should dominate the distance
events this Saturday.
UCLA has already beaten a
strong Kansas track squad this
spring, 84-71, and also ravaged a
competent Tennessee team. These
victories indicate that UCLA
should prove to be a national
power again this year. Coach
Jordan's trackmen will have to
turn in their best performances if
the team is to avenge last year's
defeat when they travel to Los
Angeles this weekend.
