Nixon Decision Hit
WASHINGTON - Capt. Aubrey M. Daniel 111,
prosecutor in the trial of Lt. William L. Calley, Jr.,
has written President Nixon that his intervention in
the case—"in the midst of public clamor"—has
damaged the system of military justice.
Reached by telephone at Ft. Benning, Daniel
refused to discuss the letter, saying "publicity was
not my purpose in writing it."
Daniel said in a letter to the President, with copies
to six senators, that he was shocked and dismayed at
Nixon's action. He said it opened the system of
military justice to charges "that it is subject to
political influence . .
"For this nation to condone the acts of Lt. Calley
is to make us no better than our enemies and make
any pleas by this nation for the humane treatment of
our own prisoners meaningless," Daniel wrote.
Lawyer Troubled
FT. BENNING, Ga. — The Army defense lawyer for
Lt. William L. Calley Jr. said Tuesday it is probably
impossible for the military jury to reconsider the life
sentence it imposed after he was convicted of
premeditated murder of My Lai villagers.
Maj. Kenneth Raby commented after he was asked
about a Los Angeles Times story which said that at
least half of the six Army officers who convicted and
sentenced Calley are having second thoughts about
the severity of the decision.
The newspaper reported that the junior member of
the courtmartial, Capt. Ronald Salem, had inquired

into the possibility of petitioning for clemency for
Calley.
Salem would discuss the story only briefly.
Boggg Attacks FBI
WASHINGTON — Rep. Hale Boggs, D-La., said
Tuesday he will in the near future "make proper use"
of detailed information supporting his demand that
FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover resign or be fired.
In a statement elaborating on his House speech
Monday accusing the FBI of wiretapping the
telephones of members of Congress, Boggs said
"numerous members of Congress have reported to mo
their firm conviction that their telephone
conversations and activities are the subject of
surveillance by the FBI."
