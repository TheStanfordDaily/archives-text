## Chicano Surgeon Denied Tenure 
### TOM GIVEN 
A growing controversy is
developing over the decision of
the Department of Surgery of the
medical school to deny tenure to
Dr. Jose Aguilar and not
re-appoint him for the coming
year.
Members of five Chicano,
black, and medical student
organizations have charged that
Dr. Aguilar, the only Chicano
faculty member of the medical
school, was not reappointed for
racial and political reasons. In a
column in today's Daily, they

charge that, "Dr. Aguilar is merely
experiencing what has been the
standard policy at Stanford
Univeristy: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white."
Denies Charges
Dr. Roy Cohen, head of the
department in question, indicated
last night to the Daily that, "there
are many allegations in that
statement that are not true." A
colleague figuring prominently in
the column, Dr. John Hanberry,
denied allegations that he had
channeled patients and residents
away from Dr. Aguilar, while
refusing to comment further on
the case.
On the other hand, Aguilar
contends that the column is "a
very accurate account," one to
which he contributed nothing.
The charges arise after
numerous meetings with
professors of the Department of
Surgery, the Dean of the Medical
School, and a review of the
decision by the central
administration. According to Dr.
Aguilar, all avenues for redress
have been exhausted on his
behalf.
When questioned last night on
KZSU, President Lyman indicated
that the review on the part of his
office was a limited affair."We
would go back over it to see that
every step was taken, to make
sure that there were no
irregularities, that no procedural
steps were left untaken," he said.
Explaining that, "neither the

president nor the provost have the
power to promote or appoint
somebody that the department
does not want to promote or
appoint."
Lyman conceded that "We do
have the power, exercized seldom
and with considerable difficulty
when we try, to stop the
appointment of some. It's hard to
get the point across because if you
have the power to say no, why
then don't you have the power to
say yes?"
According to him, no
irregularities in the
decision-making process were
discovered. "Indeed, I don't think
any irregularities have been
charged," he said.
Focus of Charges
Many of the allegations focus
on Dr. Hanberry, who is chief of
the neurosurgery division.
According to members of
MECHA, the Chicano student
organization, Dr. Hanberry told
them that he felt Dr. Aguilar to be
incompetent in his clinical
judgement as a neurosurgeon.
They further charge that he
channeled department patients
and residents from Dr. Aguilar to

private practitioners, and that the
department then charged him
with failing in his duties as a
surgeon and a teacher. In their
column, they state that, "Dr.
Han berry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department."
Dr. Aguilar has been noted for
his activity in the medical school's
minority admissions program. In
addition to recruiting Chicano
mfdica! students f"in severe
Southwestern v
he is trie pre-med auvisor to uiH
Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford. He is also prominent in
the National Chicano Health
Organization.
He plans to go into private
practice in the Bay Area,
continuing his work with People's
Medical Center in Redwood City
and other Chicano organizations.
To him, the question of his tenure
is no longer a personal matter.
"My personal feelings have to be
ignored," he says."The issue is
whether or not any person of
color is going to come here with
the understanding that there is no
future for him here."

injustices suffered to date by University workers.
A growing controversy is
developing over the decision of
the Department of Surgery of the
medical school to deny tenure to
Dr. Jose Aguilar and not
re-appoint him for the coming
year.
Members of five Chicano,
black, and medical student
organizations have charged that
Dr. Aguilar, the only Chicano
faculty member of the medical
school, was not reappointed for
racial and political reasons. In a
column in today's Daily, they

charge that, "Dr. Aguilar is merely
experiencing what has been the
standard policy at Stanford
Univeristy: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white."
Denies Charges
Dr. Roy Cohen, head of the
department in question, indicated
last night to the Daily that, "there
are many allegations in that
statement that are not true." A
colleague figuring prominently in
the column, Dr. John Hanberry,
denied allegations that he had
channeled patients and residents
away from Dr. Aguilar, while
refusing to comment further on
the case.
On the other hand, Aguilar
contends that the column is "a
very accurate account," one to
which he contributed nothing.
The charges arise after
numerous meetings with
professors of the Department of
Surgery, the Dean of the Medical
School, and a review of the
decision by the central
administration. According to Dr.
Aguilar, all avenues for redress
have been exhausted on his
behalf.
When questioned last night on
KZSU, President Lyman indicated
that the review on the part of his
office was a limited affair."We
would go back over it to see that
every step was taken, to make
sure that there were no
irregularities, that no procedural
steps were left untaken," he said.
Explaining that, "neither the

president nor the provost have the
power to promote or appoint
somebody that the department
does not want to promote or
appoint."
Lyman conceded that "We do
have the power, exercized seldom
and with considerable difficulty
when we try, to stop the
appointment of some. It's hard to
get the point across because if you
have the power to say no, why
then don't you have the power to
say yes?"
According to him, no
irregularities in the
decision-making process were
discovered. "Indeed, I don't think
any irregularities have been
charged," he said.
Focus of Charges
Many of the allegations focus
on Dr. Hanberry, who is chief of
the neurosurgery division.
According to members of
MECHA, the Chicano student
organization, Dr. Hanberry told
them that he felt Dr. Aguilar to be
incompetent in his clinical
judgement as a neurosurgeon.
They further charge that he
channeled department patients
and residents from Dr. Aguilar to

private practitioners, and that the
department then charged him
with failing in his duties as a
surgeon and a teacher. In their
column, they state that, "Dr.
Han berry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department."
Dr. Aguilar has been noted for
his activity in the medical school's
minority admissions program. In
addition to recruiting Chicano
mfdica! students f"in severe
Southwestern v
he is trie pre-med auvisor to uiH
Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford. He is also prominent in
the National Chicano Health
Organization.
He plans to go into private
practice in the Bay Area,
continuing his work with People's
Medical Center in Redwood City
and other Chicano organizations.
To him, the question of his tenure
is no longer a personal matter.
"My personal feelings have to be
ignored," he says."The issue is
whether or not any person of
color is going to come here with
the understanding that there is no
future for him here."
