# May 5 Moratorium Memorial To Last Spring
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Representatives of America's three
largest student organizations met
yesterday to announce a national
moratorium on May 5 th, in memory of
the students killed last spring in Kent,
Jackson, and Augusta.
In simultaneous press conferences in
San Francisco and Washington,
representatives of the Student
Mobilization Committee to End the
War in Southeast Asia (SMC), the
National Student Association (NSA),
and the Association of Student
Governments (ASG), called for "A day
of actions to show the world that
Nixon and Agnew cannot continue to
carry on their criminal policy in our
names and with our bodies."
Also present at the conference were
Adam Levin, of the ASSU Council of
Presidents, Nelson Nagai, president of
the Asian-American Student Alliance,
and an instructor here in
Afro-American studies. Delegates from
UC Berkeley, and a local high school
student organization also attended.
The moratorium will be held in
conjunction with a mass march in San
Francisco and Washington on the 24 th
of April, and a GI Solidarity Day on
May 16, which is Armed Forces Day.

According to Cecilia Stodola, Bay Area
coordinator for the SMC, this is a
reversal of previous SMC strategy. "In
previous years we've had local actions
building to national demonstrations,"
she noted. "It's a measure of the
growing strength of the movement that
we can now move from a national
demonstration to actions on a local
level."
Plans for the Stanford moratorium
activities are still being made, although
Levin indicated that they would
attempt to "open" the university to the
outside community by providing
seminars, teach-ins, and lectures on the
subject of American involvement in
Asia. He also, "invited members of
local, state, and national governments
to come onto the campus to express
their views and to search with us for
viable solutions." No such speakers
have yet been contacted, but he hopes
to arrange matters this month.
Ngai expressed his organization's
support of the moratorium, "Our
support is an expression of our faith in
the National Liberation Front; for the
struggle of Asians in Asia is the same as
the struggle of Asians here."
SMC coordinators also indicated
that the April 24 march will be larger
than the previous march in November
of 1969.
