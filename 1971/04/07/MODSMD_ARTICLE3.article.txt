# Berkeley Radicals Win; Police Plan Rejected
## 
### CARLA KALLEN 
A moderate white attorney, Edward
Kallgren, and three self-proclaimed
radicals won the race for four Berkeley
City Council seats in final returns
yesterday.
A ballot initiative proposing three
separate police departments for black,
white and student areas was defeated
33,000 to 13,000. All other ballot
proposals were passed.
In a very close race for mayor,
Councilman Warren Widener, 33, a
black supporter of the radical coalition,
defeated moderate vice-Mayor Wilmont
Sweeney, 21,921 to 21,865. The 56
vote margin, with 17 damaged ballots
yet to be counted, will almost surely be
challenged in a recount.
Kallgren, 4 2, supported by two
moderate campaign committees and a
conservative campaign group, was front
runner for the Council. He will at least
partially block the avowed intent of the
coalition of campus radicals and black
militants to take over city government.
The election of three members of
the slate of four radical candidates
deadlocks moderates and radicals 4-4
on the Council. 'Iliey must appoint a
ninth Council member to replace
Widener.
The three vi< orious radicals were

D'Army Bailey, 29; a black attorney;
Ilena Hancock, 30, a housewife; and Ira
T. Simmons, 28, also a black attorney.
Simmons narrowly defeated Rick
Brown, the fourth member of the
radical coalition.
The radical slate brought national
attention to the race with a platform
proposing new city services for the
poor, rent controls, child care centers
and a city income tax instead of the
property tax. The radicals have one
supporter on the Council, and would
have had control had they captured all
four seats at stake in the election.
A radical candidate also won one of
the three city school board seats in a
field of 15 candidates. Another radical
candidate for city auditor lost to the
incumbent by more than 5,000 votes.
An estimated 80 percent of
Berkeley's voters turned out for the
hotly contested election.
The highest voter turnouts, 85
percent to 93 percent, were reported at
polling places in the hills area around
the University of California. This is the
area marked "white" in the initiative to
segment the police department
A new computerized tabulation
system, requiring two transcriptions of
ballots, slowed returns, but election
officials said there were no
breakdowns.
