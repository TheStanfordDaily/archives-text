# United Front Demands Reform, Stop To Biased Grievance Policy
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
The Black United Front, a
newly-formed coalition of blacks,
presented six "non-negotiable"
demands to the Stanford Medical
Center Administration yesterday,
asking for a reply by 1:00 p.m.
tomorrow.
The demands were issued following
a noon Rally Against Racism at the
Med Center to protest the firing of Sam
Bridges, a black former Med Center
employee, and the continuing lay-offs
of other Stanford employees. Speakers
from the Black Students Union, the
United Stanford Employees, and the
faculty addressed the crowd of some
200 students and Med Center workers.
The six demands are:
1. Workers must have the right to
criticize administration policies from
the date of hiring without intimidation.
2. Workers must have the right to
organize a union which represents the
workers' interests.
3. Workers must have grievance
rights from the date of hiring.
4. Workers must have the right to
have peers be present on all grievance
procedures.
5. The rehiring of Sam Bridges with
pay for all time loss.
6. Stanford Hospital must adopt an
Affirmative Action Program.
Bridges, who worked at the Med
Center for about one month, was
recently fired, allegedly for "raising too
many questions" about Med Center
minority employment practices, as well
as for discussing his own views about
racial politics with other workers.
Supporters said Bridges violated the
terms of an unofficial six-month
"probation" period, during which
employers are said to keep tabs on new
employees, so as to weed out political
undesirables. Bridges told yesterday's
rally that he had merely been talking
with feliow workers about why hospital
authorities "give us these fucked-up
jobs nobody else would lake" while

better jobs go to non-Third World
workers; but he was fired, the Med
Center authorities told him, because
they said he didn't understand his job.
According to Med Center News
Bureau chief Spiros Andreopoulos, Med
Center officials will have "an
appropriate response" prepared by
tomorrow's deadline. Declining to
elaborate, Mr. Andreopoulos reported
that "Some of the demands are based
on a gross misunderstanding of hospital
minority programs." He denied the
existence of any six-month probation
policy at the Center.
Why BUF
The Black United Front, a
composite of the BSU, the Black
Liberation Front (a Third World
community organization based in
Redwood City and East Palo Alto), and
the Stanford Black Workers Caucus,
was set up in response to Bridges' firing
and to other campus-area lay-offs,
notably those of twelve Tresidder
Union workers. The Liberation
Front, said a spokesman, is a
revolutionary group, dedicated to
establishing a socialist society "by any
means necessary." Willie Newberry,
BSU chairman, explained at yesterday's
rally that solidarity with the BLF could
"increase our capacity to bring pressure
against the administration."
"This is not a one-time shot,"
Newberry added. "We've already found
that the administration talks one way
and acts another."
USE representative Jim Burke
echoed the sentiment. "The reasons for
unity are becoming more and more
evident," he told the crowd. "In our
strength, we can make the
administration establish a policy of no
lay-offs."
Reactions
Stanford officials contend that
budget cuts necessitate the lay-offs.
But, according to German professor

Juan Flores, Venceremos member who
also spoke at yesterday's rally, "The
Stanford professors are getting more
moneyâ€”those are the people you're not
going to find around here." Burke also
told the rally that "the administration
can find the money."
At the end of the 45-minute rally, a
BUF speaker told the crowd, "We're
not going to be pacified, because we're
angry!" Shortly thereafter, some
70-100 members of the crowd went
into the Med Center to deliver the six
demands to hospital authorities.
Hospital employees were leafletted
as the procession passed quietly, and
the group avoided disrupting Med
Center activity. After all had packed
into the second floor Administration
offices and the demands had been
presented, the crowd filed out and
dispersed.
The reaction to the demonstration
within the Med Center was predictable.
Some half dozen hospital
administrators stood in a group
discussing the incident, while many
secretaries merely looked bewildered.
One said she had been "warned" about
two minutes before the crowd entered
the building. "It was a surprise to me!"
said another. Med Center work,
however, seemed to shift quickly back
to normal.
