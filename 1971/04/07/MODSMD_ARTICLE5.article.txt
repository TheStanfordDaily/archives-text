### 
ASSU PRESIDENCY
Although the Daily feels that at least
three of the eandidate slates for ASSU
President offer some exeellent
reeommendations in their platforms, we do
not feel strongly enough about any one
slate to endorse it over the others.
We urge students to consider the issues
and vote for the most qualified candidates.
PROGRAM FEE
We urge a YES vote on the $1 program
fee for the year 1971-72. While we
recognize that many students do not feel
that they are getting a return for their
money, we feel that sueh services as KZSU,
Preregistration, Sequoia, the Conservation
Club are groups worth student support. A
vote for a $0 fee euts off student support
from a wide range of groups, from the
Pom-pon dollies to the Third World student
associations. We do not think this support
should be eliminated. However, we do not
feel that students receive more than $1
worth of return from any of these groups.
PROPOSAL FOR C-l 5 CONSIDERATION
We urge a YES vote on the proposal to
encourage the Committee of 15 to examine
the existing judicial legislation and
recommend changes. All students should
vote for this proposal, since, by doing so,
they will empower student members of the
C-l 5 to bring these matters of
constitutional revision under consideration.
We emphasize that we are not urging the
C-l 5 to make the specific
recommendations listed, but we do urge
that the C-l5 give due consideration to
them.
RECRUITING
We agree with the idea of community
control over recruiting and land use. So,
with one member strongly dissenting, we
urge a YES vote on section one of this
proposal which prohibits the use of
Stanford lands for military recruiting.
CAMPAIGN GM
Vote YES on the Campaign GM
proposal.
Campaign G.M. is back again, urging the
corporation to (1) open nominations to
their board of directors to candidates
proposed by non-management
shareholders, (2) allow G.M. employees,
dealers, and consumers to each nominate
one candidate to the Board of Directors,
(3) publish detailed information on G.M.
activities in regards to air polution, auto
safety, and minority employment.
VOLUNTARY BANKING
The Daily endorses a YES vote on the
voluntary banking amendment to Article 5,
Section 9. We agree with the proposal that
only the organizations which receive their

funds directly from ASSU appropriations
should be required to bank with the
Student's Organization Fund; the
amendment will provide greater flexibility
to unaffiliated groups who decide to
conduct their own monetary affairs.
PRESCRIBED ASSU BUDGET
We urge a NO vote on the proposed
amendment to Section 1, Appropriations:
that the ASSU budget be set according to
the prescribed appropriations in this
amendment. We believe that the duly
elected representatives of the ASSU should
remain empowered to deal with student
fees at their disposal.
UNDERGRADUATE REAPPORTIONMEN
The Daily does not endorse the
proposed amendment to Article 11, Section
2, sub-section B: that the ASSU Senatorial
constituencies be reapportioned as defined
in this amendment. While the Editorial
Board favors the "accountability"
argument, we do not feel this amendment
provides an improvement over the present
system.
PEACE PROPOSAL
We urge students to agree to the
proposal that all U.S. military personal be
removed from Southeast Asia by the end of
1971. They should have been removed long
ago.
PEOPLE S PEACE TREATY
We urge agreement with the People's
Peace Treaty. The students of this
University have no quarrel with the
Vietnamese people.
THE BAND
The Daily, somewhat enthusiastically,
urges a YES vote on the special assessment
of $1 per student for fall and winter
quarters to pay for the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band's
out-of-state trips.
"DAILY" BREAD
Vote YES on the Daily.
Student funds, always a substantial part
of our operating budget, must again be
renewed in today's election. This year, we
are asking for an increase in support to
offset the rise in costs due to inflation and
increased printing expenses. Currently,
students are assessed $1 per student per
quarter; our request this week is for a raise
of approximately 29 cents per student per
quarter.
Because the University computer is
overwhelmed when parts of dollars appear
in fees, we are forced to word our request
as "$2 per student for the fall quarter, and
$1 per student for the other three
quarters." It all averages out in the end.

ASSU PRESIDENCY
Although the Daily feels that at least
three of the eandidate slates for ASSU
President offer some exeellent
reeommendations in their platforms, we do
not feel strongly enough about any one
slate to endorse it over the others.
We urge students to consider the issues
and vote for the most qualified candidates.
PROGRAM FEE
We urge a YES vote on the $1 program
fee for the year 1971-72. While we
recognize that many students do not feel
that they are getting a return for their
money, we feel that sueh services as KZSU,
Preregistration, Sequoia, the Conservation
Club are groups worth student support. A
vote for a $0 fee euts off student support
from a wide range of groups, from the
Pom-pon dollies to the Third World student
associations. We do not think this support
should be eliminated. However, we do not
feel that students receive more than $1
worth of return from any of these groups.
PROPOSAL FOR C-l 5 CONSIDERATION
We urge a YES vote on the proposal to
encourage the Committee of 15 to examine
the existing judicial legislation and
recommend changes. All students should
vote for this proposal, since, by doing so,
they will empower student members of the
C-l 5 to bring these matters of
constitutional revision under consideration.
We emphasize that we are not urging the
C-l 5 to make the specific
recommendations listed, but we do urge
that the C-l5 give due consideration to
them.
RECRUITING
We agree with the idea of community
control over recruiting and land use. So,
with one member strongly dissenting, we
urge a YES vote on section one of this
proposal which prohibits the use of
Stanford lands for military recruiting.
CAMPAIGN GM
Vote YES on the Campaign GM
proposal.
Campaign G.M. is back again, urging the
corporation to (1) open nominations to
their board of directors to candidates
proposed by non-management
shareholders, (2) allow G.M. employees,
dealers, and consumers to each nominate
one candidate to the Board of Directors,
(3) publish detailed information on G.M.
activities in regards to air polution, auto
safety, and minority employment.
VOLUNTARY BANKING
The Daily endorses a YES vote on the
voluntary banking amendment to Article 5,
Section 9. We agree with the proposal that
only the organizations which receive their

funds directly from ASSU appropriations
should be required to bank with the
Student's Organization Fund; the
amendment will provide greater flexibility
to unaffiliated groups who decide to
conduct their own monetary affairs.
PRESCRIBED ASSU BUDGET
We urge a NO vote on the proposed
amendment to Section 1, Appropriations:
that the ASSU budget be set according to
the prescribed appropriations in this
amendment. We believe that the duly
elected representatives of the ASSU should
remain empowered to deal with student
fees at their disposal.
UNDERGRADUATE REAPPORTIONMEN
The Daily does not endorse the
proposed amendment to Article 11, Section
2, sub-section B: that the ASSU Senatorial
constituencies be reapportioned as defined
in this amendment. While the Editorial
Board favors the "accountability"
argument, we do not feel this amendment
provides an improvement over the present
system.
PEACE PROPOSAL
We urge students to agree to the
proposal that all U.S. military personal be
removed from Southeast Asia by the end of
1971. They should have been removed long
ago.
PEOPLE S PEACE TREATY
We urge agreement with the People's
Peace Treaty. The students of this
University have no quarrel with the
Vietnamese people.
THE BAND
The Daily, somewhat enthusiastically,
urges a YES vote on the special assessment
of $1 per student for fall and winter
quarters to pay for the Leland Stanford
Junior University Marching Band's
out-of-state trips.
"DAILY" BREAD
Vote YES on the Daily.
Student funds, always a substantial part
of our operating budget, must again be
renewed in today's election. This year, we
are asking for an increase in support to
offset the rise in costs due to inflation and
increased printing expenses. Currently,
students are assessed $1 per student per
quarter; our request this week is for a raise
of approximately 29 cents per student per
quarter.
Because the University computer is
overwhelmed when parts of dollars appear
in fees, we are forced to word our request
as "$2 per student for the fall quarter, and
$1 per student for the other three
quarters." It all averages out in the end.
