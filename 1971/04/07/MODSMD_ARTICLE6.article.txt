## Institutional Racism Again 
### 
Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last

the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor

Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor

Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
incompetent. He is probably the
only Chicano neurosurgeon in the
country. Why is Stanford so set
on dismissing him?
Shortly after his last
appointment renewal he was
instrumental in establishing the
minority student recruitment
program at the Medical School.
He has alienated several powerful
people at the Medical Center
because many of the students he
supported for admission did not
meet with their approval, which
would not have caused much
concern, except that Dr. Aguilar
contended that he knew more
than they about Chicanos and
would not change his decisions.
This alienation is reflected in
the lack of concern by several
professors about the issues
presented here. The acting dean of
the Medical School, a full
professor of surgery, knew next to
nothing about the actual
decision-making processes that
had taken place in regard to Dr.
Aguilar's tenure. When we went to
him, he could only tell us that Dr.
Hanberry is head of that division
and must therefore be right.
Dr. Hanberry was sent two
student petitions requesting his
presence to help clarify matters at
Monday's meeting. He was
concerned enough to come two
hours after the meeting had
begun, and then only because two
of the students went to his office
and personally escorted him to
the room. He was able to answer
one question before the meeting
was forced to end. He might have
answered several had the acting
dean not interrupted the
questions by objecting that Dr.
Hanberry's comments could in no
way be relevant to the issues at
hand.
Provost Miller, who was also
present, left the meeting with no
apparent thought of reconsidering
Dr. Aguilar's reappointment, in
spite of indications that he
considered our objections quite
valid. After two hours of the same
contradictory answers from the
surgeons in the room, we were
convinced that they were no more
concerned about objectivity than
they were a year ago.
Now let us consider some of
the chronology leading to Dr.
Aguilar's appointment at Stanford
and some of his achievements in
the field of neurosurgery.
1. Dr. Aguilar terminated his
training in July of 1960 at the
Montreal Neurological Institute
(incidentally, the same place that
Dr. Hanberry, Chief of
Neurosurgery at Stanford,
received his training).
2. From August 1960 to
December of 1961, he worked in
research at the U.C. Berkeley
Cyclotron. During this period he
sought an appointment to the
Stanford and U.C. departments of
neurosurgery without success.
3. At the end of 1961, Dr.
Aguilar was appointed Chief of

Neurosurgery, Los Angeles
Veterans Administration Hospital
(U.C.L.A.).
4. In January of 1963, he was
advised of his "unsuitability" for
the VA UCLA appointment
because of incompatibility with
the policies of the representative
for the UCLA Dean's Committee
Administration for the VA. In
spite of this friction with the
UCLA people, Dr. Aguilar
remained at this appointment
until May of 1964. By this time,
he had received his accreditation
in neurosurgery by passing the
National Board Examination in
Neurosurgery. His clinical service
with the VA was not criticized at
the time of his departure. Just
prior to leaving UCLA, he
received a tentative appointment
to the Stanford Neurosurgery
Division.
5. In June of 19 64 , approval of
the Stanford appointment failed.
The reason stated was, "poor
grades in medical school."
(One must stop to wonder at
this point how an individual who
has successfully been accredited in
one of the most difficult areas in
medicine could possibly be
evaluated by his medical school
transcript, ten years earlier.)
Also, a lack of positive support
from UCLA was given as a reason
for denial of the appointment.
6. In July of 19 64 , Dr. Aguilar
entered into group practice at Mr.
Zion Hospital in San Francisco.
His capacity' was related to
research, stereotaxic brain surgery
and performing domestic
neurosurgery procedures. During
this period, he was attending the
Palo Alto Veterans
Administration Hospital.
7. In January of 1965, he was
notified by the Stanford
Neurosurgery Department that he
had been reconsidered and would
be appointed. Therefore, Dr.
Aguilar left a harmonious
relationship with his colleagues at
Mt. Zion and accepted the
appointment to Stanford.
8. In September of 1965, he
began his appointment as "Chief"
of Neurosurgery at the Palo Alto
Veterans Administration Hospital.
He was also advised to develop
stereotaxic surgery at Stanford.
There were no identifiable
resources.
9. Finally, in November of
1965 negotiations started with the
hospital board for funding the
stereotaxic project.
10. The stereotaxic acquisition
was made operational in April of
1967. The first stereotaxic
operation was a complete success.
(This was the first and last of Dr.
Aguilar's operations that was
attended by Dr. Hanberry, the
head of Neurosurgery at
Stanford). In the subsequent year,
Dr. Aguilar completed a backlog
of operations alleviating a disorder
of movement in Parkinson's
Disease.
11. In May, 1 967 , Dr. Aguilar
was awarded a grant award for
epilepsy research (utilizing VA
research funds).
12. In June, 19 67, the research
wing at Stanford Medical Center
was completed, and he was
assigned to an empty research
space. At this time he was also
notified that the $50,000 which
had been promised him earlier for
this research, had been depleted in
construction.
13. In July of 1967, he was
removed from his duties at the
VA Hospital. Recognition of his
clinical achievement was stated by
the VA Central Office. They also
requested designation as the
Center for Neurosurgery Services,
VA, Northern California Area.
(This consideration was

ncho, mecha, snma, al, blf, smsa

subsequently lost, the reason
being the lack of a full time
neurosurgeon at the Palo Alto VA
from Stanford.)
14. In September of 1967, he
was assigned as a full time faculty
member at the Stanford Medical
Center. His duties were
unspecified, and he was advised to
do research.
15. In January of 1968, he
received from the Neurosurgery
and Neurology staff promises to
supplement the operating room
monitoring equipment and utilize
operating spaces in epilepsy
research. These failed to
materialize.
16. In February of 1968, he
was notified of his reappointment
to Stanford for a second three
year term. He was also told, "no
research, no tenure." Therefore,
Dr. Aguilar was reappointed on a
third basis as Assistant Professor
of Neurosurgery and forced away
from as highly professional
Neurosurgery service at the VA
Hospital. He had previously
negotiated with Drs. Tachibana
and Birzis to collaborate with
Stanford University's
neurosurgery projects in clinical
and basic research.
17. In October of 1 969, the
neurosurgical treatment of
Parkinsonian Tremor was
de-emphasized. In its place a
study on the drug L-Dopa was
begun on patients.
18. In November of 1969, Dr.
Aguilar submitted a request to
Drs. Hanberry, Chase (Chief of
Surgery) and Glaser (former
Medical School Dean) that his
reappointment with tenure be
considered. A progress report of
his research work was also
submitted. It was not until sixteen
months later that he received a
reply to that request. (This was
probably only because of a strong
student and house staff appeal to
President Lyman).
19. In August, 1970, Dr.
Aguilar received an N.I.H. award
to do Impedographic Analysis of
Brain Function. The starting date
would be September of 1970, a
three year, $50,000 /annum
award. J.A. Aguilar was named
co-principal investigator.
20. In October of 1970, he
received a letter from Dr. R.
Chase, stating denial of his tenure
for September 1,1971.
21. Finally, in February of
1971, he reappealed to Dr.
Hanberry to reconsider his
appointment with tenure.
Besides all of these efforts, Dr.
Aguilar works with the People's
Medical Center in Redwood City.
He was also very instrumental in
initiating a successful minority
admissions program at Stanford
Medical School. He personally
recruited Chicano students from
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Texas and Colorado. He is also
prominent in the National
Chicano Health Organization and
is now acting pre-med advisor to
all Chicano undergraduates at
Stanford and other California
colleges. This capacity at Stanford
was necessitated because of the
lack of understanding, guidance
and concern for Chicanos and
other minority students by the
existing framework.
The facts presented herein
serve to clarify our position that
the review of Dr. Aguilar's
appointment to a tenured position
has lacked in both thoroughness
and objectivity. It also points out
that, possibly to Dr. Lyman's
surprise, subinstitutions do exist
at Stanford University and that
these subinstitutions have the
power to block the professional
progress and contributions of an
individual on the basis of his
demonstrated concern for human
rights and his political beliefs and
associations.
Dr. Aguilar's greatest liabilities
include: his dedication to the
student, state and national health
care procurement and
participation by Chicanos and
other people of color, as well as
being the only Chicano M.D. in
the nation who is affiliated to a
medical institution.
It should be pointed out,
however, that Dr. Aguilar's case is
not unprescedented. Stanford
University and especially the
Medical School and Medical
Center have not allowed Chicanos
or other people of color to
participate in the policy-making
process in matters applying to
them as students, employees and
regional community. Dr. Aguilar
is merely experiencing what has
been the standard policy at
Stanford University: there is no
advancement whether you be a
janitor or a neurosurgeon if your
skin is not white.

Dr. Jose Aguilar, the only
Chicano member of the Stanford
University Medical School faculty,
is being dismissed from his
position. Several weeks of
inquiries by students and Dr.
Aguilar culminated Monday in an
open meeting with several
professors from the Surgery
Department with the hope that
we could determine the exact
reasons for his dismissal. A
statement made by Dr. Roy Cohn,
acting head of the department,
made it clear to us that his
reappointment is undesirable,
because it would confer tenure to
Dr. Aguilar, and the department
would then "be stuck with him."
This meeting was the last effort
initiated by the students to get
from the department some sort of
unified argument for Dr. Aguilar's
dismissal. Up until this time,
opposing statements had been
made by different professors with
whom we'd spoken. We had been
able to talk with three of the nine
men who decided on Dr. Aguilar's
value to the neurosurgery division.
Three of them had no knowledge
of anything he's done. One
commented that he thought it was
merely a personality conflict
between Dr. Aguilar and Dr.
Hanberry, the chief of the
neurosurgery division. The three
pointed out that they could not
go against Dr. Hanberry's decision
because it would undermine the
delicate power structure within
which everyone here operates.
The other two men with whom
we spoke are Dr.'s Hanberry and
Cohn themselves. The former is
the only person who is in any way
familiar with Dr. Aguilar's work,
the latter is very familiar with Dr.
Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar. This is the point upon
which all our questions hinge. Is
Dr. Hanberry's evaluation of Dr.
Aguilar accurate? We don't feel it
is, yet his reports are the evidence
used against him.
Dr. Hanberry told us several
weeks ago that he feels Dr.
Aguilar is incompetent in his
clinical judgement as a
neurosurgeon. He has, therefore,
channeled department patients
and residents to private
practitioners instead. Now the
department acuses Dr. Aguilar of
not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon and teacher, and they try
to prove it to us by showing us
data on patient and student
numbers. This only shows us that
Dr. Hanberry was successful in his
efforts to exclude Dr. Aguilar
from participating fully in the
department.
Sixteen months ago, half-way
through his second three year
appointment, Dr. Aguilar sent a
letter to the dean of the medical
school, the head of surgery, and
to Dr. Hanberry, complaining
about this professional exclusion.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from any of
them until two weeks ago when
Dr. Cohn mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter of
November, 1969, had been
reviewed during his evaluation â€”
no further comment was made.
We emphasize that this

happened during his second
appointment to the position of
assistant professor, because it
raises further questions. Can you
believe that the surgery
department of Stanford Medical
School would reappoint a
neurosurgeon to their faculty,
only to set about excluding him
from patient and student contact,
because they thought he was
incompetent? The only
incompetence we could possibly
conclude from this data, would be
that incompetence shown by
those who reappointed him in the
first place.
Dr. Aguilar has been examined
and reexamined by professional
boards throughout his educational
career - none have ever found him
