resign
Editor, THE DAILY:
We intend to send the
following letter to David Packard
with as many Stanford signatures
as can be collected in the next
week from faculty, staff and
students. Copies will be
circulated, and will also be
available at tables in White Plaza.
We urge all who agree with its
contents to join us as co-signers.
Eleanor E. Maccoby,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.,
B. Davie Napier
Robert McAfee Brown
Dear Mr. Packard:
We recognize that in the past
you have done many creative
things within the Stanford
community and have been
sensitive to many of the social
issues that concern us all. We are
therefore aware that you know
that the issue of "war crimes" is
no longer a theoretical matter for
academic debate. There is an
increasing body of opinion in this
country insisting that the
principles invoked against
Germans and Japanese by
American tribunals after World
War II would now be turned
against our own leaders and
similar verdicts rendered against
them for the war crimes we are
committing in Southeast Asia.
Such judgments come from
people of the stature of Telford
Taylor, U.S. Chief Counsel at
Muremberg, and other eminent
men in the legal and academic
professions. They assert that not
only military men who order or
commit the overt acts can be
found guilty, but also the civilian
decision-makers responsible for
the policies leading to such acts.
It should be a matter for sober
reflection on your part that on
the basis of these concepts you
could be indicted and convicted
for war crimes. It is beyond
dispute that you are deeply
identified with policies that have
led to some of the most ghastly
acts men have ever committed -
the unwarranted deaths of
thousands of civilians, women,
children and aged, the heedless
destruction of villages, the
defoliation of forests and crops,
the forced evacuation of civilians
from their homes, the inhuman
treatment of prisoners - all "war
crimes" according to international
law.
In the face of these actions
that bring dishonor and shame not
only to you but to all Americans,
we call upon you to resign as
Deputy Secretary of Defense and
thus to disassociate yourself from
the commission of further war
crimes. We urge you to do this not
only because if one is committing
war crimes it is imperative to stop
committing them, but also
because such an act on your part
could have an impact of untold
magnitude. Most of the rest of us
can do very little to end the war,
but an act of resignation on your
part could lead to a subsequent

re-evaluation of the evil policies
we are pursuing.
There has been a tremendous
erosion of faith in our
government, and in the men who
make our present policy decisions.
That erosion will only continue
unless men like you, profoundly
implicated in those policies, can
summon the moral courage to
repudiate them. Few things would
do more to change such policies
than your public indication that
you no longer intend to be one of
the chief architects of ongoing
war crimes committed in the
name of America.
Thus for the sake of the
physical survival of the
Vietnamese, and for the sake of
the moral survival of the United
States, we plead with you to join
us in saying "no" to the killing
and the war crimes, by resigning
your post and turning your great
talents from destructive to
creative actions.
Sincerely yours,

Editor, THE DAILY:
To call the article concerning
Doug McHenry "news analysis"
pays it a compliment that
overrates the quality of the article
beyond belief. The article fails to
look beneath the surface of
student politics over the last two
or three years.
Ever since black students have
become a viable political force on
this campus, every white group
has tried to manipulate them on
one way or another. Some of the
great manipulators include Shea,
Grant, Lyman and even some
members of the more liberal and
radical campus groups. What has
happened is that the attempts to
manipulate have failed. Especially
in the last few months, the
Shea-Grant duet has been running
home with their tails between
their legs. They have finally
realized that "Masters" are on the
way out. I predict that other
"Masters" will continue to lose as
history goes on, and I mean
high-up "Masters."
It is also true that some radical
members of the Senate feel that
on occasion McHenry has
"stabbed them in the back." As
the record will indicate, I do not
always agree with the way
McHenry or the minority caucus
has voted in the Senate.
Nevertheless, as any real attempt
at analysis would reveal, the
interest of black students and
white students, even radical white
students, do not always coincide.
The need for survival sometimes
does result in less than "pure"
political choices. It is easy to
criticize an occasional incorrect or
distasteful political decision
(among which I do not include
the election of Banks or
Humphrey) made by a group
fighting for psychological,
political, cultural, and economic

survival at a major, private white
university. It is much more
difficult to analyze the forces,
some subtle and some overt, that
make it necessary for third world
students to fight for that survival,
and the article in the Daily about
McHenry failed miserable to
engage in that kind of analysis.
The article also failed in other
important aspects. It failed to ask:
"What former female ASSU
Elections Commissioner was the
faithful companion throughout
many of last year's ASSU Senate
meetings of a well known student
body officer whose last name
begins with "S?"; "Is that same
former Elections Commissioner

still on the ASSU payroll in the
capacity of assistant financial
manager?". The answers to those
questions will definitely aid the
attempted "news analysis."
1 make no claims to complete
objectivity in this matter. As you
may remember, 1 received B.S.U.
support when I ran for the Senate
last fall. A thorough, in depth,
new analysis of the matter under
discussion would have served the
interests of the whole community.
But whose interest did the
superficial news analysis
serve?â€”that is an important
question.
