# Student Rights, Banking Proposals

### 
(Due to a misunderstanding
between the editorial page editors
of the Daily, the following colums
were inadvertently omitted from
yesterday's forum on the ballot
initiatives. —Ed.)
Three years ago Provost
Richard Lyman said, "The
establishment of new legislative
and judicial structures in the area
of student conduct is of central
importance to the future of this
institution." In less than three
years Lyman has succeeded in
disestablishing the very structures
he pledged to support on May 9,
1968.
I believe that the sanctity of
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter must be reestablished if
there is to be any semblence of
fairness in student disciplinary
cases.
The Student Rights Proposal
on this week's ballot is a good
first step towards establishing
fairness in the judicial system.
Vote "yes" to amend the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of
1968.
Illegal Actions
The SJC eliminated the
Judicial Aide required by Article
11, Section C of the Charter. It
also issued its own rules which
amended various sections of the
Charter, including the one which
provides sanctions for refusal to
cooperate with the SJC.
The application of judicial
policies to faculty members
(originally recommended by the
President) was quietly
undermined with the claim (by
the President) that there were no
provisions in the Charter for
faculty disciplinary cases and that
attempts to write amendments to
the Charter to provide for such

cases were unsuccessful.
Meanwhile, the SJC switched
to an adversary system (with a
paid University prosecutor, but
with no public defender) despite
the fact that there are no
provisions in the Charter for
adversary proceedings and that
attempts to write amendments to
the Charter to provide for such
proceedings were unsuccessful.
First, the SJC should be a jury
of peers and members of the
SCLC should be chosen from the
constituency over which the SJC
has jurisdiction. The Student
Rights Proposal provides for this
as follows:
A. No regulation concerning
student conduct be promulgated
or enforced, except with the
concurrencyof legislative bodies
or judicial panels composed only
of students, or of both students
and faculty if and only if full
reciprocation exists with respect
to the promulgation or
enforcement of regulations
concerning faculty conduct.
B. With respect to the
enforcement of whatever
regulations be enacted in
accordance with paragraph (A)
above, no proceedings be
undertaken which contravene in
any way the guarantee of
individual rights contained in the
Constitutions of the United States
and the State of California.
Third, the President must be
removed from the judiciary
branch of University government,
except that he should retain the
authority of any chief executive
to commute sentences and pardon
convicted students. Further he
should not have the power to
unilaterally promulgate
regulations, adjudicate alleged
violations of regulations, or reject

amendments to the Charter.
C. Under the revised Charter
the power of the President of the
University shall be strictly limited
to granting amnesty or
commuting sentences.

Voluntary ASSU Banking
The ASSU Constitution now
requires all voluntary groups to
bank with the ASSU. The Student
Financial Manager has been
unable to find any reason for this
costly and unenforceable rule and
has proposed this amendment to
make banking with the ASSU
voluntary.
