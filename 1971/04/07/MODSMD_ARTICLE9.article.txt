# many employees relocated
## Personnel Efforts Detailed 
### 
If solutions to problems could
be found in direct correlation to
the number of words heaped upon
them,then by now surely the
workforce reduction problem at
Tresidder could be considered
solved. Daily recitations and
broadsides from the critics tell us
that if we would but follow their
clearly given directions, not only
would the problems go away, but
maybe the critics might go away
too. Neither miracle,
unfortunately, is at hand.
Problem resolution is found
more in deeds than words, and it
is the daily effort of the Personnel
staff that has brought about true
alleviation of the effects of
workforce changes. Diligent
actions by Personnel and the
cooperation of Stanford
departments have made it possible

to keep the University's rate of
unemployment, i.e., those whose
employment has been terminated
through no fault of theirs, at 1.2
percent per year, which is much
better than either the national
average or the average in
California. And because the
University continues to have
turnover in many job categories,
there is a reasonable chance of
shrinking that rate even further.
Since September, at least 21
full time employees who either
had been laid off or faced this
possibility during the current
academic year have been
successfully relocated within the
University. Reviewing actions
taken since the first of Jan., only
21 full time employees are now in
lay-off status, and this includes the
employees from Tresidder. (Of the
1 2 Tresidder employees laid off,
three now have employment with
Stanford, and two are now being
considered for University employ
ment. Two have found other work
but would like to return. The
status of three is uncertain be
cause of personal questions. There
are three at this writing who have
not found any kind of employ
ment.)
Although turnover in the
University is down to about 14
percent (annual rate) this still
means that about 70 positions ot
all kinds open up each month, and

thus there are chances for
reassignments and the
identification of some openings
for retraining.
The necessary factors to make
the reassignment approach
successful are 1) advance notice
and 2) cooperation. The record on
advance notice is improving but
could be better. The same is true
for cooperation; departments
must be more willing to consider
qualifiable and trainable
candidates during this period of
adjustment. Many departments
have been very helpful, and I am
looking to the others to offer
additional assistance.
As this kind of problem is
difficult to overcome under the
best of conditions, we could well
do without actions by those who
seek to aggravate, rather than help
to resolve the problems before us.
The logical turn by which an
economic boycott (as at
Tresidder) is supposed to assist in
establishing continuing
employment in a direct-sale
activity is lost upon me. 1 regret
to see the present Tresidder
financial situation become subject
to cynical exploitation by those
who find joy through daily
protestation.
