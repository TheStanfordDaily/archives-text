# Confusion Clouds Packard Visit
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Some confusion arose yesterday over
whether David Packard, the Deputy
Defense Secretary, would make a
previously scheduled speech today in
Palo Alto.
Packard was originally scheduled to
speak on "The Department of Defense
in a Generation of Peace" before the
Western Electronics Association
(WEMA) at Rickey's Hyatt House, but
last night the Hyatt House said the
speech had been cancelled. A WEMA
director, however, told the Daily that
the speech was still on.
Directors of WEMA apparently were
meeting last night to determine a new
location.
Packard is a co-founder of
Hewlett-Packard and a former Stanford
trustee.
Several Stanford and Midpeninsula
groups are planning a march today at
4:30, to meet Packard at 5:30 and try
to arrest him for war crimes. The
groups are Palo Altans Against the War,
the Stanford Committee for the Right
to Live, the Inquisition, and
Original plans called for
the meeting at Palo Alto Square, at the
intersection of Page Mill and El
Camino, and a march from there to the
Hyatt House.
Speaking, But Where?
"We know Packard is definitely

going to be speaking at the assigned
time," Lenny Siegel of the New Left
Project said last night. "There are
conflicting reports of where it (the
speech) is going to be. So we'll meet at
4:30, then march or drive to where it's
going to be. We will know by then." He
advised those who want to participate
in the demonstration to bring cars.
Arriving at the speech site at about
5:30, the march organizers say they
will serve Packard with a warrant they
have drawn up which charges him with
aiding the commission of crimes
prohibited by The Army Field Manual
of the Law of Land Warfare (No.
27-10) and the Geneva Accords of
1949. A mock trial is to be staged at a
rally in White Plaza this afternoon.
No Violence
"If attacked, however, we reserve the
right to defend ourselves as necessary.
If Mr. Packard is certain of his
innocence, let him come peaceably and
stand trial."
Support for the march's stated aims
came in a letter sent to The Daily
signed by seventeen Stanford
professors. The letter which urges
support for non-violent action, appears
inside today's Daily. Prof. Pierre Noyes
of SLAC wrote and circulated the letter
after attending the meeting on Sunday
night.
The Noyes letter points to Prof. Kurt
Steiner's ideas in saying Packard could

be prosecuted for war crimes. Steiner
was a prosecutor in the war crimes
trials in Tokyo after World War Two.
"There are the precedents of the
Tokyo and Nuremberg trials," Steiner
told the Daily. "People in the position
of David Packard were accused, tried,
convicted. He might be accused. I don't
know whether he would be found
guilty, whether an investigation would
find he could be charged."
A leaflet says "We intend no violence
against persons—although Mr. Packard
and his friends are steeped in violence.
We intend no destruction of
property—though they are attempting
to destroy Indochina.

director, however, told the Daily that
the speech was still on.
Directors of WEMA apparently were
meeting last night to determine a new

Packard is a co-founder of
Hewlett-Packard and a former Stanford
trustee.
Several Stanford and Midpeninsula
groups are planning a march today at
4:30, to meet Packard at 5:30 and try
to arrest him for war crimes. The
groups are Palo Altans Against the War,
the Stanford Committee for the Right
to Live, the Inquisition, and
Original plans called for
the meeting at Palo Alto Square, at the
intersection of Page Mill and El
Camino, and a march from there to the
Hyatt House.
Speaking, But Where?
"We know Packard is definitely

going to be speaking at the assigned
time," Lenny Siegel of the New Left
Project said last night. "There are
conflicting reports of where it (the
speech) is going to be. So we'll meet at
4:30, then march or drive to where it's
going to be. We will know by then." He
advised those who want to participate
in the demonstration to bring cars.
Arriving at the speech site at about
5:30, the march organizers say they
will serve Packard with a warrant they
have drawn up which charges him with
aiding the commission of crimes
prohibited by The Army Field Manual
of the Law of Land Warfare (No.
27-10) and the Geneva Accords of
1949. A mock trial is to be staged at a
rally in White Plaza this afternoon.
No Violence
"If attacked, however, we reserve the
right to defend ourselves as necessary.
If Mr. Packard is certain of his
innocence, let him come peaceably and
stand trial."
Support for the march's stated aims
came in a letter sent to The Daily
signed by seventeen Stanford
professors. The letter which urges
support for non-violent action, appears
inside today's Daily. Prof. Pierre Noyes
of SLAC wrote and circulated the letter
after attending the meeting on Sunday
night.
The Noyes letter points to Prof. Kurt
Steiner's ideas in saying Packard could

be prosecuted for war crimes. Steiner
was a prosecutor in the war crimes
trials in Tokyo after World War Two.
"There are the precedents of the
Tokyo and Nuremberg trials," Steiner
told the Daily. "People in the position
of David Packard were accused, tried,
convicted. He might be accused. I don't
know whether he would be found
guilty, whether an investigation would
find he could be charged."
A leaflet says "We intend no violence
against persons—although Mr. Packard
and his friends are steeped in violence.
We intend no destruction of
property—though they are attempting
to destroy Indochina.

TO SPEAK AGAlN?—David Packard, Deputy Secretary of Defense here addresses
the Old Union sit-in in the spring of 1968. Yes, that is Bruce Franklin looking on.
Hickey's Ryatt House said last night that Packard's planned speech there tonight

Some confusion arose yesterday over
whether David Packard, the Deputy
Defense Secretary, would make a
previously scheduled speech today in
Palo Alto.
