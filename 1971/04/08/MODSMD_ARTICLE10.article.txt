To the Stanford Community in
response to questions raised on
April 6 th with respect to hospital
policies;
1. "Workers must have the right
to criticize administration policies
from the date of hiring without
intimidation."
All employees have the right to
criticize administration policies.
In addition, there are regular
opportunities of communicating
employee views to the
administration. If there are any
instances in which that policy has
been violated, I would appreciate
having the evidence brought to
my attention.
2. "Workers must have the right
to organize a union which
represents the workers' interest. "
Employees are free to decide if
they wish to join unions. The
Hospital was involved in a union
election in 1967, and union
organizing activities have been
held regularly since then.

3. "Workers must have grievance
rights from date of hiring. "
Present Hospital policy is
ambiguous on this point. Our
practice, however, has been to
make grievance procedures
available to employees regardless
of length of service. I will take
steps to clarify the Policy Manual
on this point.
4. "Workers must have the right
to have peers present on all
grievance procedures."
While the grievance procedure
does not explicitly provide for the
presence of peers at the early
steps, our practice has been to
allow it as is expressly set forth in
later steps of the grievance
procedure.
5. "T/ze rehiring of Sam Bridges
with pay for time loss. "
Mr. Bridges was informed of
the opportunity to file a grievance
and was given a copy of the
Hospital's Grievance Procedure

(Section 525) and of the Rules of
Conduct (Section 500) with those
violations pertaining to him
underlined. He has not chosen to
bring his case before the
Grievance Committee.
6. "Stanford Hospital must adopt
an Affirmative Action Program."
Stanford University Hospital
has an Affirmative Action
Program, and is in the process of
completing its documentation.
For the past two years Stanford
University Hospital has had a
Black Advisory Committee
selected by Black employees.
More recently the Alianza Latina,
composed of most of the Spanish
speaking employees of the
Medical Center, has been formed.
These groups have been actively
involved in the implementation of
the Hospital's Affirmative Action
Program.
