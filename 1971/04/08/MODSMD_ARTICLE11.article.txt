arrest packard
Editor, THE DAILY:
Among the "conventional war
crimes" for which civilian and
military leaders of other
governments have been convicted
under our own laws, and which
past and present U.S.
administrations are charged with
committing under continuing
policies in Southeast Asia, are the
following: massacre of civilians,
reprisal destruction of villages,
torture and murder <■* prisoners,
poisoning of crop land, and
destruction of civilian food
supplies.
According to both prosecution
and defense counsel for those
trials, including Professor Steiner
of our own University, Deputy
Secretary for Defense Packard,
among others, could be convicted
under these extant laws and
precedents. An attempt will be
made to perform a "citizen
arrest" of Packard on Thursday,
April 8 at Richey's Hyatt House.
Since a citizen arrest does not
entail the use of force, there will
be no attempt to provoke
violence. We therefore urge all
who sympathize with this action
to be present for peaceful
picketing and support, and all
who wish to minimize the chance
that violence will be used against
the demonstrators to be present as
observers. A sidewalk march will

start on El Camino at Page Mill at
4 :30 p.m., and picketing in front
of Rickey's at 5:30 p.m.

boycott unfair
Editor, THE DAILY:
We, the student workers at the
Tresidder drugstore, would like to
express some thoughts about the
present boycott of the store,
whose stated purpose is the
rehiring of twelve workers laid off
from the Tresidder cafeteria. We
would like to point out that the
drugstore has no more relation to
the cafeteria than the Coffeehouse
or other Tresidder services do.
(The Coffeehouse was boycotted
half-heartedly last week, but the
boycotters have decided to
concentrate on the drugstore,
probably due to the unpopularity
and ineffectiveness of the
Coffeehouse boycott.)
Furthermore, one of the drugstore
employees was consulted by other
workers or worker-boycotters in
the manner that a union of
workers generally operates.
The boycotters' leaflets make
certain false implications about
the drugstore. Contrary to their
inferences, it simply is not true
that the drugstore has been
making increased profits due to
the boycott of the cafeteria.
Neither is it true that our
overhead, or surplus of profit,
goes to make up for what the
cafeteria is losing.
The drugstore is operated on a
non-profit basis. After all our
expenses, including salaries, are
covered, what surplus we have
goes towards maintaining the free
services that Tresidder offers such
as the Browsing Room. The same
is true of the Coffeehouse.

Although the stated purpose of
the boycott is to get the laidoff
workers rehired, some of the
placards now advocate closing
down Tresidder. Firstly, although
the University does subsidize
Tresidder so that Stanford
students can have student services,
a university's first priority is not
the maintenance of a student
union, and Stanford does not have
to keep Tresidder open. Secondly,
boycotting the drugstore,
decreasing its profits, and
threatening the future existence
of both drugstore and union will
hardly help the situation of any of
the Tresidder employees.
To close the Union, it would be
logical to boycott all the services,
not just the drugstore. Tresidder
takes a certain percentage of the
profits made by the bowling
alleys, ticket offices, and
barbershop, as well as rental
charges for the space leased to
them. The picketers, who include
both students and non-students
and even some junior high
schoolers, have singled out the
drugstore as a noontime target
instead of putting themselves at
the doors of all the Tresidder
services morning, noon and night.
We think they have acted unfairly
and illogically— and may hurt
more people than they will help.

one man show
Editor, THE DAILY:
As I have seen education in the
Computer Science and E.E. depts.
of the graduate school, the
emphasis has been on competitive
academic attainment
autocratically judged.

Students are the passive
recipients of knowledge imparted
almost completely by instructor
lectures. Students sit (and
hopefully learn) but participate
little. A lecture is a one man
show, and interaction between
people is minimal. The instructor
in true autocratic fashion makes
all decisions concerning
curriculum, assignments,
evaluation, and everything else.
The role of the student is to
accept this situation as indeed the
best of all possible worlds. Is it
though? Even granting that his
turn will come and eventually he
can be an autocrat, a professor
say, is it really?
The end result of this mode of
education is too often a specious,
pedantic type individual: the
nitpicker whose hallmark is a
penchant for finding trivial fault,
which edifying achievement exalts
his spirit as it validates his
superiority. The shallow
autocratic personalities created in
the image of the system producing
them go out into industry and the
nations schools and colleges ...
Stanford must set a viable
democratic example, most of all
in its classrooms. A synthetic
situation obsessed with grade
attainment as a paramount goal is
a prescription for producing cold,
plastic, autocratic individuals;
their cerebral potential and
attainment not withstanding. In
the interests of students, faculty,
and society a better way must be
found. It is the responsibility of
both students and faculty to insist
on this, and not to be complacent
merely because this condition is
commonplace or even endemic.
Like any disease it should be
cured.
