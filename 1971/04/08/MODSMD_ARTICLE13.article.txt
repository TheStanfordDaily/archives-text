Warning of a possible infringement
of academic freedom, 66 Stanford
Academic Council members have signed
a petition urging President Richard W.
Lyman to lift the suspension of
Associate Prof. H. Bruce Franklin.
In a separate action, about 30 young
persons expressed their support for
Professor Franklin in a peaceful picket
outside the Academic Council meeting
Friday afternoon
Still being circulated for additional
signatures, the faculty petition to the
President states that "Since none of the
charges (to the Advisory Board against
Professor Franklin) bore any
discernible relationship to his
performance of his regular duties, it
could only be assumed that you wished
to prevent Professor Franklin from
using his classroom for political
purposes that might dirupt University
business.
"When the University obtained the
restraining order ... that possibility
was virtually eliminated by the first
seven paragraphs," which prohibit a
variety of disruptive and destructive
acts.
"We therefore see no way in which
the suspension serves the interest of the
University," the petitioners declared.
"It may, indeed, constitute a violation
of academic freedom, since a professor
is being unnecessarily prevented from

teaching prior to a hearing by the
Advisory Board and because of activity
outside the classroom.
"Moreover, many students in the
University wishing to take courses from
Professor Franklin will be prevented
from doing so by his suspension."
Initial sponsors of the petition
included Profs. Larry Altman,
chemistry; Frank Lobdell, and William
Bowman, art; Mark Mancall and Phil
Dawson, history; John Moore, classics;
Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Avram Goldstein,
pharmacology; Laurence Kedes,
medicine; and Bliss Carnochan, Ronald
Rebholz, Robert Polhemus, and Lucio
Ruotolo, English.
The English Review Club, a graduate
student group, leafleted about 170
persons who attended its regular spring
quarter meeting Friday.
"We will not be intimidated by
repressive threats or actions," the Club
said. "We would like to make it
especially clear that we will not tolerate
the dismissal or prolonged suspension
of Bruce Franklin."
Responding to a specific request
from Professor Franklin that his
suspension be lifted, President Lyman
last week said he did not intend to
revoke his earlier action. No date has
yet been set for the Advisory Board
hearing.
