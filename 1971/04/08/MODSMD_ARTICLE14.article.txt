Residence Staff
Next year the staffing arrangements
in residences will be different as a result
of recommendations made by a
faculty-staff committee and accepted
by President Lyman. This committee
conducted a study of university
residences and concluded that the
student-staff positions of Resident
Assistant and Sponsor should be
replaced by the positions of House
Associate, Senior House Associate, and
House Fellow.
These positions will be open to both
undergraduate and graduate students.
According to Dan Williams, associate
dean of students, all candidates
appointed to positions will be
compensated according to their
qualifications and interests without
regard to their undergraduate or
graduate status.
Base salaries will start at $900 for a
House Associate, $1200 for a Senior
House Associate and $1 700 for a House
Fellow. An applicant may be eligible
for an "experience increment" which
would be added to his base salary.
Students eligible for such an
"increment" will include graduate and
undergraduate staff seeking
reappointment and candidates with

"unusual work experience or academic
skills."
Applications are available in the
Dean of Students Office and all
applications are due before 5 p.m.,
Friday, April 16. Students who have
questions concerning the application
and selection process should contact
Anita Anzaldua at x 3 0 4 5 .
Each student who applies for a
Residence Staff position must have an
interview. These interviews will be
scheduled at the time the application is
filed. The final decision on selection
and placement will be made between
May 13 and May 19.
Bomb Threat
The Faculty Club was briefly
evacuated at Stanford early yesterday
afternoon, following a telephoned
bomb threat. No device was found.
During the noon hour, about 20
pickets backing the boycott of
Tresidder Memorial Union
demonstrated in the patio behind the
club, where several firecrackers were
exploded.
About half the group moved into the
lower lobby quietly with signs, then
left when the dining room doors were
closed at 12:30 p.m. The protesters

went outside, then tapped on the
windows of the Club before leaving the
area.
Shortly thereafter, around 12:45
p.m., campus police received a call
warning that a bomb was at the Club.
The caller was an anonymous male.
Peace Corps
Seniors graduating this June with
majors in math, science, engineering,
architecture, psychology, social science
and the languages have the opportunity
to work in Africa, Asia and Latin
America for two years or more.
Sixty-three countries in three
continents have submitted requests for
manpower assistance to cover the above
skills. On campus this week to explain
the requests and jobs available are three
Peace Corps representatives, Chuck
Stout, David Fletcher and Isaac Kwesi
Sam.
The team is located near Mem Claw,
and will be available for discussion
daily from 9 :30 to 3 :30 a.m.
The Peace Corps pays all travel
expenses and provides the volunteer
with monthly living-allowance. The
host government provides housing
facilities. In addition, Peace Corps saves

$75.00 every month for each volunteer.
The amount is given to the volunteer
when he returns to the U.S.
