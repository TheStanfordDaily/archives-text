# New Grading Definitions Aim At Greater Precision

### DOYLE McMANUS 
Remember Registration Day? When, with trembling hands, we all thumbed
through our Reg packets for our report cards?
Many of us received surprises that day. Indeed, the more observant among us
received one surprise too many—an extra little surprise that was, to say the least,
disquieting.
For whereas in bygone days the A was described on the card as denoting
"excellent" work, and B "good" work, and the C "satisfactory" work, the
descriptions given on last quarter's cards are "exceptional performance,"
"superior performance," and "satisfactory performance."
Ouch.
Actually, in this year of an experimental grading system, nothing should come
as a surprise. And when all this new terminology is explained, it isn't as
disquieting as at first glance.
Explain Grades More Precisly
According to a memorandum from Dean of Undergraduate Studies .James
Gibbs— whose office prepared the definitions— to the Academic Council, the
change in terminology was "designed simply to state more precisely the
qualitative meaning which the faculty as a whole attaches to these grades; it was
not meant to suggest a change in the nature of A, B, or C."
The change is part of an r tempt by the Committee on Undergraduate Studies
to clear up some of the confusion over the new grading system, which was
originally established "to de-emphasize grades, allowing students to pursue
excellence in their chosen areas of concentration and interest without pressure for
grades in other areas of academic work."
Part of the new system— the elimination of the D grade and substitution of "no
credit," which is not recorded on the permanent transcript— was made, Dean
Gibbs told the Daily, so that the C grade "would not be extended." Gibbs said,
"Some instructors were stretching the C minus downwards... There was a
question as to whether we were simply no longer recording D work, or whether
the C would extend to barely acceptable performance. If people begin using the C
where they used to give D's, then the C becomes a very undesirable grade."
Integrity Of Pass Questioned
The committee has also moved to uphold the integrity of the "Pass" grade
(given when courses are taken on the "Pass-No Credit" basis) by establishing a
deadline for arranging to take a course under that system. The deadline this
quarter is May 1 2.
According to Gibbs' memorandum, "A real danger to the integrity of the
Pass-No Credit system has arisen in instances where students have indicated on
their examination booklets that they would prefer to receive a Pass, if their work
did not warrant either an A or a B. Under these circumstances of A, B, or Pass, the
aim of the new grading system is corrupted, and Pass becomes equal to C."
The memorandum also prohibited instructors from requiring additional work
from students seeking letter grades, in courses where both alternatives are offered.
In another recent action the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies set forth the qualifications necessary for faculty sponsors of
Undergraduate Special courses, and for short-term appointments as "Preceptor
and "Assistant Preceptor" for non-faculty instructors. The committee also set
forth an enrollment limit of forty on all Undergraduate Specials, which may be
waived onlv when the instructor is a member of the faculty.
