# Nixon Raises Troop Withdrawals
## 
### 
From Wire Services
President Richard M. Nixon last
night announced a slight increase in
monthly troop withdrawals from South
Vietnam for a seven month period.
At the same time, the President told
a nationwide radio and television
audience:
"I can assure you tonight with
confidence that American involvement
in this war is coming to an end."
Nixon said he intends to withdraw
100,000 U.S. troops from South
Vietnam between May 1 and Dec. 1 —
an average of slightly under 14,500
troops a month, compared to the
present rate of 1 2,500 troops a month.
The reductions will reduce the
Indochina troop level to 184,000. The
President did not project troop levels
beyond Dec. 1.
It seemed clear that the President
was not bowing to widespread public
and private pressure to announce
something dramatic that would promise
an early — or a precise — end to U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
"In my campaign for the presidency,

I pledged to end American involvement
in this war. I am keeping that pledge.
You should hold me accountable if I
fail."
Nixon defended the Laos and
Cambodian invasions, saying that the
Laosian incursion was "even more
damaging to the capability of the North
Vietnamese to sustain major offensives
in South Vietnam."
Calley Reference
The President made an indirect
reference to the court-martial
conviction of First Lt. William F.
Calley Jr. on charges of premeditated
murder at My Lai. Saying he spoke as
commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, Nixon said:
"I feel it is my duty to speak up for
the two and a half million fine young
Americans who have served in Vietnam.
The atrocity charges in individual cases
should not and cannot be allowed to
reflect on their courage and their
self-sacrifice. War is a terrible and cruel
experience for a nation and particularly
for those who bear the burden of the
fighting."
The President never specifically
mentioned the Calley case, but spoke
simply of "concerns which have been
raised in this country, fanned by
reports of brutalities in Vietnam."
'Vietnamization Has Succeeded'
Nixon again called for an immediate
and unconditional release of all
prisoners of war and asked for more
meaningful discussions at the Paris
peace talks.
"Vietnamization has succeeded," the
President declared, noting that the
South Vietnamese Army (ARVN)
engaged in Laosian combat without
U.S. advisors.
The success of the Vietnamization
program, the President said, was what
prompted him to continue the U.S.
troop withdrawals. Nixon used two
large charts located near his White
House desk to discuss the troop level
figures.

Using familiar phrases, Nixon asked
the nation:
"Shall we leave Vietnam in a way
that — by our own actions —
consciously turns the country over to
the Communists? Or shall we leave in a
way that gives the South Vietnamese a
reasonable chance to survive as a free
people? My plan will end American

involvement in a war that would
provide that chance.
"One American dying in combat is
one too many. Our goal is no American
fighting and dying any place in the
world. Every decision I have made in
the past and every decision I make in
the future will have the purpose of
achieving that goal."

The President never specifically
mentioned the Calley case, but spoke
simply of "concerns which have been
raised in this country, fanned by
reports of brutalities in Vietnam."
'Vietnamization Has Succeeded'
Nixon again called for an immediate
and unconditional release of all
prisoners of war and asked for more
meaningful discussions at the Paris
peace talks.
"Vietnamization has succeeded," the
President declared, noting that the
South Vietnamese Army (ARVN)
engaged in Laosian combat without
U.S. advisors.
The success of the Vietnamization
program, the President said, was what
prompted him to continue the U.S.
troop withdrawals. Nixon used two
large charts located near his White
House desk to discuss the troop level
figures.

Using familiar phrases, Nixon asked
the nation:
"Shall we leave Vietnam in a way
that — by our own actions —
consciously turns the country over to
the Communists? Or shall we leave in a
way that gives the South Vietnamese a
reasonable chance to survive as a free
people? My plan will end American

involvement in a war that would
provide that chance.
"One American dying in combat is
one too many. Our goal is no American
fighting and dying any place in the
world. Every decision I have made in
the past and every decision I make in
the future will have the purpose of
achieving that goal."
From Wire Services
President Richard M. Nixon last
night announced a slight increase in
monthly troop withdrawals from South
Vietnam for a seven month period.
At the same time, the President told
a nationwide radio and television
audience:
"I can assure you tonight with
confidence that American involvement
in this war is coming to an end."
Nixon said he intends to withdraw
100,000 U.S. troops from South
Vietnam between May 1 and Dec. 1 —
an average of slightly under 14,500
troops a month, compared to the
present rate of 1 2,500 troops a month.
The reductions will reduce the
Indochina troop level to 184,000. The
President did not project troop levels
beyond Dec. 1.
It seemed clear that the President
was not bowing to widespread public
and private pressure to announce
something dramatic that would promise
an early — or a precise — end to U.S.
involvement in Indochina.
"In my campaign for the presidency,

I pledged to end American involvement
in this war. I am keeping that pledge.
You should hold me accountable if I
fail."
Nixon defended the Laos and
Cambodian invasions, saying that the
Laosian incursion was "even more
damaging to the capability of the North
Vietnamese to sustain major offensives
in South Vietnam."
Calley Reference
The President made an indirect
reference to the court-martial
conviction of First Lt. William F.
Calley Jr. on charges of premeditated
murder at My Lai. Saying he spoke as
commander-in-chief of the armed
forces, Nixon said:
"I feel it is my duty to speak up for
the two and a half million fine young
Americans who have served in Vietnam.
The atrocity charges in individual cases
should not and cannot be allowed to
reflect on their courage and their
self-sacrifice. War is a terrible and cruel
experience for a nation and particularly
for those who bear the burden of the
fighting."
