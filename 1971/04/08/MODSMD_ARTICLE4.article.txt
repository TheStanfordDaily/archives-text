# Army Recruiter Target Of Guerrilla Ambush
## 
### 
Claiming that they are "committed to implementation" a guerrilla group called
the Volunteers of America threw balloons filled with putrid chemicals at a U.S.
Army recruiter late yesterday morning. The incident occurred at the Stanford
Career Planning and Placement Center where Sgt. John Strunks was talking with
students about the military.
Five persons wearing ski masks and scarves entered the center shouting
"Victory to the NFL." They proceeded to throw rotten tomatoes, paint, and
balloons filled with a foul smelling chemical at Strunks. The group, none of which
have been identified, then escaped through the back door.
In a statement released yesterday the VOA said that "there is a world-wide war
going on." They claim that in the war "Stanford has chosen the side of U.S.
Imperialism by serving as a tool of the . . . military and the large . . . corporations
profit from the war; by oppressing workers, third world people; and by
attempting to repress the anti-war movement..."
The guerrilla group claims to have "chosen the side of the people." Their action
yesterday was in support of the People's Peace Treaty to which they have pledged
"to take whatever actions are appropriate to implement the terms of the treaty
and insure its acceptance by the government of the United States."
The Stanford fire department was called in to ventilate the Placement Center.
In a separate demonstration two dozen women, mostly faculty wives, maintained
a vigil in front of the center.
