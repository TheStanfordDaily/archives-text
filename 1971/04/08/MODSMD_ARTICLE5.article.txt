# Irregularities Evident In Election Balloting
## 
### FRED MANN 
At least half a dozen different
election violations were reported to the
Daily yesterday during the first half of
the current two-day ASSU elections.
The Daily forwarded all reports to
Elections Commissioner Louis
Humphrey.
Voting continues today from 9:00
a.m. to 4:00 p.m. at seven different
campus locations.
The most prevalent violation
concerned the marking of the new
plastic student body cards by poll
officials. The cards were marked with
felt-tip or ball-point pens to record that
a student had been given a ballot. Daily
reporters and numerous callers reported
that marks made by either instrument
were usually easily erasable, giving those
who wished it a chance to vote more
than once.
At least nine such reports were
received from different sources. Others
stated that their student body cards
were never marked at all by election
officials.
First Time Tried
This is the first election to be held
since the institution of the plastic
photo ID cards by the University. In
the past, paper student body cards were
holed with a paper-puncher and
therefore permanently marked. The
new plastic cards are also marked by
the Special Events Board and the
Athletic Department for proof of
purchase of tickets to concerts and
sports events.
Primary victim of the unforseen
plastic card troubles is Commissioner
Humphrey. Contacted yesterday, he
expressed knowledge of the problem
and stated it would somehow be
remedied by the time the polls open
today.
Humphrey did not feel the reported
violations were serious enough to
warrant invalidation of yesterday's
returns.
Other Violations
Daily reporters observing poll
proceedures during the morning

yesterday noted other election
violations, many of them typical of
previous student elections.
They included at least one person
being allowed to vote without
presenting a student body card, at least
one person voting without signing the
voter list, campaign literature being
posted too near polling places, and
similar leaflets being distributed to a
number of voters while they were
filling out ballots.
Candidates whose literature was seen
posted within the agreed upon limit
denied having placed it there. Election
officials attempted to remove all such
material. Leafleters also moved away
from the polls when asked to do so.
One Daily reporter stated that
although he saw violations, those
working the polls did "an excellent job
under difficult, if not impossible
conditions."
When all the ballots are counted
tonight, a check will be made of the
signed voter lists to insure against
anyone voting more than onceâ€”at least
under the same name.
Humphrey stated approximately
2,000 ballots were cast in yesterday's
voting.
