# Aguilar Case
## Med School Replies To Charges 
### KIM McCALL 
Charges that Dr. Jose Aguilar, a
Chicano faculty member in the
Stanford Medical School was denied
tenure for racial and political reasons
are unfounded, John L. Wilson, acting
dean of the Medical School, said
yesterday. Aguilar is a neurosurgeon
who was filling his second three-year
appointment as an assistant professor
of surgery.
According to faculty appointment
procedures of the Medical School, Dr.
Aguilar was notified November 19 70,
that he would not be reappointed, Dr.
Wilson explained. The decision was
made by an eight-member committee
of senior faculty of the Department of
Surgery. The case was reviewed in
March 1971, at his request, and the
decision not to reappoint him was
upheld.
The charges made by the Stanford
chapter of the National Chicano Health
Care Organization, (NCHO) stated that
Dr. Hanberry, chief of neurosurgery,
felt that Aguilar was incompetent and
therefore channeled patients and

students away from him. The NCHO
claims Hanberry then stated that
Aguilar was not fulfilling his duties as a
surgeon by not serving enough patients
and students.
Sixteen months ago Aguilar sent
Wilson and Hanberry a letter protesting
his exclusion from professional referrals.
He received no reply, not even an
acknowledgement from either of them
and heard nothing about it until two
weeks ago when Dr. Hoy Cohn, acting
head of surgery, mentioned to him that
the contents of his letter had been
reviewed during his evaluation. No
further comment was made.
In regard to the charge of
incompetence, it is argued that Aguilar
has an exceptionally successful
operation record. Hanberry who made
the charge has only attended one of his
operations, and this was successful they
claim. Also, if Aguilar were actually
incompetent, he would not have been
appointed to a second term as assistant
professor, it is further charged.
Aguilar's supporters believe that

there are other reasons for his loss of
reappointment. He tries to practice
preventive medicine rather than
devoting most of his energy to research,
which is more profitable to the school.
He also works with the People's
Medical Clinic in Redwood City and
was very instrumental in initiating a
successful minority admission program
at the Med School having recruited
several Chicano students.
Pr. Wilson said that Aguilar was not
the only assistant professor who did
not get a reappointment. Funding
problems, research projects that do not
pan out, faculty productivity, or
changing departmental needs count
heavily in the reappointment of
faculty, Wilson commented. The charge
of racial bias was unjustified, he added.
He said the Provost's office has
investigated this case, and no
irregularities were discovered in the
decision-making process.
MECHA announced that there will
be a rally at noon today in front of the
Med school to discuss the Aguilar case.
