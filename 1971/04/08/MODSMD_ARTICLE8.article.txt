# welcome to the fold
## Good King And I: Freedom Notes 
### 
Barry wood

The other day I stumbled into
the local jail and was immediately
confronted by a prisoner dressed
in sacks. He came on with a bit of
a twitch under one eye and a
twinkle in the other saying
"Welcome to the Fold, Brother,
Welcome to the Fold."
I asked him what the Fold was
and he said that nearly the whole
world was folding up but, "Never
mind," he said, "The King will
straighten things out. The Good
King will straighten it all out."
I told him I thought that was
nice and who was the Good King
anyway. With that his eye
twitched and the other eye
twinkled and he said, "You mean
you haven't heard? The Good
King is the one who will save us
from this jail."
I told the old prisoner that I
didn't need to be saved from this
jail, I only had to walk out the
way I came in. But the prisoner
rolled back his head in a giant
laugh and shouted "That's what
they all say. I just stumbled in, I
can leave anytime. But you can't,
only the Good King can save us."
I told him that maybe only the
Good King could save him but
that I intended to leave

immediately and that I did not
belong in the jail like him. But he
laughed his ghastly laugh again
and said with a twinkle, "If you
don't belong here why did you
just stumble in?" I told him that
it was an accident, and that it
didn't matter anyway.
No Accidents
"Oh, yes it does matter. There
are no accidents here. You
wouldn't have stumbled in if you
didn't belong here. I didn't belong
here either, but one day I too
stumbled in, and now I belong
here."
"But haven't you ever thought
of just up and walking out?" I
asked, to which heanswered, "Oh
yes, I have, many times, but it is
essential to see that only the
Good King can let us out."
Not much of this was making
sense to me, so I asked him what
he thought would happen to me if
I just up and left. "Well," he said,
"the Good King will have a
terrible hold on your soul and
you'll come back." I asked him if
there was any way to get out
without feeling so bad that you
would want to come back, and he
said there wasn't. "Mind you," he
said, "you are free to try anytime.

The Good King allows us all the
freedom to come and go. But if
you go you'll be desperately
unhappy."
Sincere Twitch and Twinkle
I began to think about all this
seriously and noticed how sincere
the prisoner looked with his
twitch and his twinkle and his
sacky clothes, so I decided to
push things a little more. "If we
belong in this jail, then why isn't
everybody else in here too?"
"Oh they are," he said,
everybody is in jail, even the ones
out there, but they don't know it,
or they choose to ignore it. In
here are those who know it." His
eye twinkled.
Rather disconcerted by this
reply, I began to question him
about the Good King who would
let us out. "The King, ah yes, the
Good King. The Good King rules
over all this land and gives us so
much freedom that we can come
and go as we please. He is truly a
Great and Good King. He owns
this jail and everything else.
"But then it is the King who
has locked up all these poor
witched like yourself, and that is
why it is only the King who can
set you all free."
"Oh no," he said, "the King is a
Perfectly Good King and would
never keep people in jail. He only
lets them out."
The old prisoner's eyes
twinkled again. "They all stumble
in," he said, "just like you did.

And then only the Good King can
set them free."
All The People Belong Here
"Well it seems like a funny
system to have a King who is
Perfectly good and lets people
out of jail who keep stumbling in.
Why does he own this jail—or
better still, why doesn't he tear it
down?"
"That's easy, he owns the jail
because all the people belong
here, but don't know it. You see,
the Good King knows that people
are basically jailbirds, so he has
benevolently provided the jail.
Moreover, he runs things so well
in this jail that anyone who is
stuck outside is miserably
unhappy and soon wants to come
in. Isn't he a Wonderful King?"
I got up and told the old
prisoner that I thought I had to be
going now. "Yes, you do that," he
said, "Our Good King has given us
all the freedom to come or go, as
we wish. But you mark my
words—you will soon see that the
whole world is a jail, and you'll be
back."
1 left the old prisoner there
with one eye twitching and the
other twinkling, and I left the
only way that made any sense. I
deliberately stumbled out like- I
stumbled in—and so accidently
lost my way to freedom.
