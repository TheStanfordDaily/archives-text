# U.s. policy source of crimes
## Packard Before Calley

Three months have passed since Henry Cabot
Lodge attempted to speak at Stanford. Today
another man, equally responsible for the War in
Southeast Asia, will come to Palo Alto to speak.
David Packard, who currently manages the
Pentagon, has been one of the chief architects of the
Peninsula military electronics complex—as Stanford
Board Chairman, Hewlett-Packard Board Chairman,
SRI Executive Committee Member, and director of
several other local and national corporations.
Several anti-war groups have called for the arrest
of Packard as a war criminal. We have chosen this
tactic because many people were confused by the
issues raised by the Lodge demonstration. We feel
that our community must make a clear statement
that our area's most notorious war criminal will not
be allowed to continue what he is doing in our
names.
The term "war crimes" is particularly appropriate
at this time. Lieutenant Calley was convicted for
murdering Vietnamese civilians. He is guilty, but we
must remember that justice means preventing future
crime, not avenging the past. To prevent the further
systematic destruction of the population,
environment, and culture of Indochina, we must
look to the source of Calley's crime.
Women And Children Fight
In his defense, Calley testified that women and
children, far from being innocent civilians in
Vietnam, were some of the Viet Cong's best
fighters. Other veterans of the war, as well as the
National Liberation Front itself, have claimed the
same. This is no accident. The NLF is fighting a
People's War, in which the bulk of the population
participates. America's only strategy is to attempt
to destroy the people.
The "proper" term for this is urbanization.
Through the saturation bombing of the Indochinese
countryside, the U.S. hopes to destroy the culture,
if not eliminate the people, in areas governed by the
Provisional Revolutionary Government. Those
people who survive are relocated into concentration
camps or urban slums as their land is defoliated.
Not only does this make it more difficult for
guerillas to operate in the countryside, but it
provides a surplus (cheap) labor force for American
or Japanese assembly plants, which are expected to
flock to Indochina should the U.S. succeed in
establishing some measure of stability.

The policy of urbanization and destruction began
many years ago, with strategic hamlets and search
and destroy missions. The U.S. found that the war,
in this form, was too costly. It cost too much
money. It cost too many American lives. Taxpayers
were complaining. Gl's were refusing to serve as
cannon fodder. And the Vietnamese "friendlies"
turned out to be unfriendly or ineffective.
Increased Terror
In came Nixon, with his rhetoric of winding
down the war—pulling out ground combat troops.
Nixon's low-profile policy meant replacing U.S.
manpower with firepower and airpower. New
weapons systems needed development if the war
was to be won. Today those weapons systems are in
U9e in Southeast Asia. They are not "winning" the
war, but they increase the terror under which the
Vietnamese must live—or die.
Nixon appointed a Congressman, Mel Laird, to
head the Department of Defense. But Laird had no
experience as an administrator. Laird had never
supervised the development and production of large
weapons systems. Packard, through his many
associations in business, had. Packard, as Deputy
Defense Secretary, would oversee the acquisition of
the latest in war machinery produced by the defense
industry which he helped build.
Though Packard has received more publicity for
his role in pushing the "Safeguard" ABM, several
less-known weapons systems have evolved in the
Pentagon to carry out Nixon's policies in Asia. The
generic term for many of these is the electronic
battlefield. Sensing devices—to detect living things,
moving things, etc.—are hooked into computer
banks which evaluate the signals and direct air
bombardment or artillery fire onto the target. True,
this equipment cannot distinguish between friend and
foe, guerilla and civilian, but in a People's War there
is no way to make that distinction.
U.S. war policy, as formulated by Johnson,
Lodge, Nixon and Packard, operates on the
assumption that the people of rural Vietnam, Laos
(where they must live in caves), and Cambodia are
the enemy. This is why Calley's murders occurred.
This is why such murders occur daily. This is why
rulers are war criminals. Unless we work to stop
their crimes, we too must share the guilt.
