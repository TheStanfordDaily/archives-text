# Hospital Sit-in Follows BUF Rally
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN, ED KOHN KIM McCALL 
About 45 persons were preparing to bed down on the second floor of Stanford
Hospital early this morning as a non-violent sit-in called to protest the firing of a
black hospital worker and five other employee grievances continued.
The group decided to remain overnight in the hospital corridor after an
hour-long meeting with Dr. Thomas Gonda, director of the hospital, resolved only
five of the protestor's six demands.
According to persons present at the late-night bargaining session, Dr. Gonda
refused to reinstate Sam Bridges, a black custodian at the hospital who was
recently fired on a variety of charges.
Gonda has scheduled another meeting with the group at 9 :30 a.m. today.
The sit-in began with a misunderstanding between the Black United Front
(BUF), a group representing Bridges, and Gonda.
About 80 members of the BUF and supporters of Bridges, claiming that they
had a 1 p.m. appointment with Gonda, marched to his office following a noon
rally at the steps of the Medical School.
Sit Down and Wait
When Gonda did not appear the group decided to sit down in the corridor
outside his office and wait for him. Gonda's whereabouts were unknown during
most of the day. He told those present at the bargaining session that he did not
realize he had a 1 p.m. appointment with the group.
The late night meeting with Aguilar was set up by John L. Wilson, executive
director of the medical care program, after he had met for an hour earlier with the
BUF leaders.
The purpose of the meeting, according to a BUF spokesman, was to hear a
personal response to the six demands regarding hospital policies toward minority

workers which the BUF presented to Gonda on Tuesday. The meeting was closed
to members of the press.
When the group showed up at Gonda's office at 1 :20 p.m., hospital deputy
director Frank Vitale passed out a paper which Gonda had prepared earlier with
written responses to the six demands. Said Vitale, "The reason he (Gonda) is not
here is that he has made a response and I don't think he understood that he was to
be here."
At press time, the group had not been declared an illegal assembly nor had it
officially been asked to leave the corridor by University officers.
Early in the afternoon, however, Vitale had asked the group to leave, saying
they were disrupting hospital operations.
Concern For Patients
According to hospital associate director Ken Dunkle, "They've been very
concerned about patients, but any situation of this type is just very unnatural for
a hospital. While they've been fairly quiet it's been disruptive .. . it's just got to be
(disruptive)."
Throughout the day the corridor was left open to hospital staff and patients
and the group remained quiet after hearing requests not to disturb the hundred
patients nearby.
The sit-in followed a rally called by MECHA and BUF to protest the Bridges'
firing and Medical School's failure to grant tenure to Dr. Jose Aguilar, a chicano.
Aguilar told the rally: "Somehow all my life I've been hearing somebody tell
me I'm half-assed good. After hearing that for so long, I'm almost inclined to
believe it. All of a sudden now there's good reason for me not to believe what
other people tell me—that I'm incompetent, etc.—because I know that somebody
out there loves me."
The chicano supporters of Dr. Aguilar at first moved into the hospital with the
BUF, but left when the sit-in began.
Six Demands
The protestor's six demands included: workers' rights to criticize
administration policies;to orguiize to have grievance rights from date of hiring; and
to have peers present at all grievance procedures. The hospital was also asked to
adopt an Affirmative Action Program to hire and train minorities and to reinstate
Bridges with back pay.
In his response which took the form of an open letter to the Stanford
community, Gonda stated:
"All employees have the right to criticize administration policies ... Employees
are free to decide if they wish to join unions. . . Our practice has been to make
grievance procedures available to employees regardless of length of service . . .
"Our practice has been to allow (for the presence of peers) as it is expressly set
forth in later steps of the grievance procedure .. . Mr. Bridges has not chosen to
bring his case before the Grievance Committee .. . Stanford University has an
Affirmative Action Program, and is in the process of completing its
documentation."
Committee Review
An important aspect of the Bridges firing involves a review of the case by the
Black Advisory Committee (BAC), a group of eight black hospital workers whose
job it is to advise Gonda.
BAC sent out a memorandum (see page two) to hospital employees yesterday
saying in part, "We, the members of the Black Advisory Committee, upon reading
the charges made by Mr. Sam Bridges, did, in fact, conduct a thorough
investigation regarding his dismissal ... It was our conclusion that Mr. Bridges was
terminated because he was not doing the job he was hired to do, and therefore
putting an added burden on his co-workers.
BAC met with leaders of BUF for several hours during the afternoon. The result
of this meeting was a one sentence statement by James Cheatham, a member of
BAC. "It has come to our attention that all the facts in the Sam Bridges case have
not been presented."
Later Cheatham told the Daily that the statement was not meant to deny the
committee's earlier memorandum. Willy Newberry, chairman of the Black
Student's Union, a member of the BUF, however, said that Cheatham's statement
"effectively invalidates" the previous memorandum, adding "it now carries little
or no weight." .
BAC has scheduled an 8 a.m. meeting this morning with the BUF to continue
discussions.

The protestor's six demands included: workers' rights to criticize
administration policies;to orguiize to have grievance rights from date of hiring; and
to have peers present at all grievance procedures. The hospital was also asked to
adopt an Affirmative Action Program to hire and train minorities and to reinstate
Bridges with back pay.
In his response which took the form of an open letter to the Stanford
community, Gonda stated:
"All employees have the right to criticize administration policies ... Employees
are free to decide if they wish to join unions. . . Our practice has been to make
grievance procedures available to employees regardless of length of service . . .
"Our practice has been to allow (for the presence of peers) as it is expressly set
forth in later steps of the grievance procedure .. . Mr. Bridges has not chosen to
bring his case before the Grievance Committee .. . Stanford University has an
Affirmative Action Program, and is in the process of completing its
documentation."
Committee Review
An important aspect of the Bridges firing involves a review of the case by the
Black Advisory Committee (BAC), a group of eight black hospital workers whose
job it is to advise Gonda.
BAC sent out a memorandum (see page two) to hospital employees yesterday
saying in part, "We, the members of the Black Advisory Committee, upon reading
the charges made by Mr. Sam Bridges, did, in fact, conduct a thorough
investigation regarding his dismissal ... It was our conclusion that Mr. Bridges was
terminated because he was not doing the job he was hired to do, and therefore
putting an added burden on his co-workers.
BAC met with leaders of BUF for several hours during the afternoon. The result
of this meeting was a one sentence statement by James Cheatham, a member of
BAC. "It has come to our attention that all the facts in the Sam Bridges case have
not been presented."
Later Cheatham told the Daily that the statement was not meant to deny the
committee's earlier memorandum. Willy Newberry, chairman of the Black
Student's Union, a member of the BUF, however, said that Cheatham's statement
"effectively invalidates" the previous memorandum, adding "it now carries little
or no weight." .
BAC has scheduled an 8 a.m. meeting this morning with the BUF to continue
discussions.

FRUITLESS CONFRONTATION-Frank Vital e, Deputy Director of the
Stanford Hospital, and Willie Newberry of the BSU glare at each other as Sam
Bridges, recently fired hospital janitor, looks on. Vital e wanted to discuss the
minority demands, but Newberry would wait until Thomas Gonda, Hospital
Director, showed up for his alleged appointment 10 hours late.
About 45 persons were preparing to bed down on the second floor of Stanford
Hospital early this morning as a non-violent sit-in called to protest the firing of a
black hospital worker and five other employee grievances continued.
The group decided to remain overnight in the hospital corridor after an
hour-long meeting with Dr. Thomas Gonda, director of the hospital, resolved only
five of the protestor's six demands.
According to persons present at the late-night bargaining session, Dr. Gonda
refused to reinstate Sam Bridges, a black custodian at the hospital who was
recently fired on a variety of charges.
Gonda has scheduled another meeting with the group at 9 :30 a.m. today.
The sit-in began with a misunderstanding between the Black United Front
(BUF), a group representing Bridges, and Gonda.
About 80 members of the BUF and supporters of Bridges, claiming that they
had a 1 p.m. appointment with Gonda, marched to his office following a noon
rally at the steps of the Medical School.
Sit Down and Wait
When Gonda did not appear the group decided to sit down in the corridor
outside his office and wait for him. Gonda's whereabouts were unknown during
most of the day. He told those present at the bargaining session that he did not
realize he had a 1 p.m. appointment with the group.
The late night meeting with Aguilar was set up by John L. Wilson, executive
director of the medical care program, after he had met for an hour earlier with the
BUF leaders.
The purpose of the meeting, according to a BUF spokesman, was to hear a
personal response to the six demands regarding hospital policies toward minority

workers which the BUF presented to Gonda on Tuesday. The meeting was closed
to members of the press.
When the group showed up at Gonda's office at 1 :20 p.m., hospital deputy
director Frank Vitale passed out a paper which Gonda had prepared earlier with
written responses to the six demands. Said Vitale, "The reason he (Gonda) is not
here is that he has made a response and I don't think he understood that he was to
be here."
At press time, the group had not been declared an illegal assembly nor had it
officially been asked to leave the corridor by University officers.
Early in the afternoon, however, Vitale had asked the group to leave, saying
they were disrupting hospital operations.
Concern For Patients
According to hospital associate director Ken Dunkle, "They've been very
concerned about patients, but any situation of this type is just very unnatural for
a hospital. While they've been fairly quiet it's been disruptive .. . it's just got to be
(disruptive)."
Throughout the day the corridor was left open to hospital staff and patients
and the group remained quiet after hearing requests not to disturb the hundred
patients nearby.
The sit-in followed a rally called by MECHA and BUF to protest the Bridges'
firing and Medical School's failure to grant tenure to Dr. Jose Aguilar, a chicano.
Aguilar told the rally: "Somehow all my life I've been hearing somebody tell
me I'm half-assed good. After hearing that for so long, I'm almost inclined to
believe it. All of a sudden now there's good reason for me not to believe what
other people tell me—that I'm incompetent, etc.—because I know that somebody
out there loves me."
The chicano supporters of Dr. Aguilar at first moved into the hospital with the
BUF, but left when the sit-in began.
Six Demands
The protestor's six demands included: workers' rights to criticize
administration policies;to orguiize to have grievance rights from date of hiring; and

rally at the steps of the Medical School.
Sit Down and Wait
When Gonda did not appear the group decided to sit down in the corridor
outside his office and wait for him. Gonda's whereabouts were unknown during
most of the day. He told those present at the bargaining session that he did not
realize he had a 1 p.m. appointment with the group.
The late night meeting with Aguilar was set up by John L. Wilson, executive
director of the medical care program, after he had met for an hour earlier with the
BUF leaders.
The purpose of the meeting, according to a BUF spokesman, was to hear a
personal response to the six demands regarding hospital policies toward minority

workers which the BUF presented to Gonda on Tuesday. The meeting was closed
to members of the press.
When the group showed up at Gonda's office at 1 :20 p.m., hospital deputy
director Frank Vitale passed out a paper which Gonda had prepared earlier with
written responses to the six demands. Said Vitale, "The reason he (Gonda) is not
here is that he has made a response and I don't think he understood that he was to
be here."
At press time, the group had not been declared an illegal assembly nor had it
officially been asked to leave the corridor by University officers.
Early in the afternoon, however, Vitale had asked the group to leave, saying
they were disrupting hospital operations.
Concern For Patients
According to hospital associate director Ken Dunkle, "They've been very
concerned about patients, but any situation of this type is just very unnatural for
a hospital. While they've been fairly quiet it's been disruptive .. . it's just got to be
(disruptive)."
Throughout the day the corridor was left open to hospital staff and patients
and the group remained quiet after hearing requests not to disturb the hundred
patients nearby.
The sit-in followed a rally called by MECHA and BUF to protest the Bridges'
firing and Medical School's failure to grant tenure to Dr. Jose Aguilar, a chicano.
Aguilar told the rally: "Somehow all my life I've been hearing somebody tell
me I'm half-assed good. After hearing that for so long, I'm almost inclined to
believe it. All of a sudden now there's good reason for me not to believe what
other people tell me—that I'm incompetent, etc.—because I know that somebody
out there loves me."
The chicano supporters of Dr. Aguilar at first moved into the hospital with the
BUF, but left when the sit-in began.
Six Demands
The protestor's six demands included: workers' rights to criticize
administration policies;to orguiize to have grievance rights from date of hiring; and
to have peers present at all grievance procedures. The hospital was also asked to
adopt an Affirmative Action Program to hire and train minorities and to reinstate
Bridges with back pay.
In his response which took the form of an open letter to the Stanford
community, Gonda stated:
"All employees have the right to criticize administration policies ... Employees
are free to decide if they wish to join unions. . . Our practice has been to make
grievance procedures available to employees regardless of length of service . . .
"Our practice has been to allow (for the presence of peers) as it is expressly set
forth in later steps of the grievance procedure .. . Mr. Bridges has not chosen to
bring his case before the Grievance Committee .. . Stanford University has an
Affirmative Action Program, and is in the process of completing its
documentation."
Committee Review
An important aspect of the Bridges firing involves a review of the case by the
Black Advisory Committee (BAC), a group of eight black hospital workers whose
job it is to advise Gonda.
BAC sent out a memorandum (see page two) to hospital employees yesterday
saying in part, "We, the members of the Black Advisory Committee, upon reading
the charges made by Mr. Sam Bridges, did, in fact, conduct a thorough
investigation regarding his dismissal ... It was our conclusion that Mr. Bridges was
terminated because he was not doing the job he was hired to do, and therefore
putting an added burden on his co-workers.
BAC met with leaders of BUF for several hours during the afternoon. The result
of this meeting was a one sentence statement by James Cheatham, a member of
BAC. "It has come to our attention that all the facts in the Sam Bridges case have
not been presented."
Later Cheatham told the Daily that the statement was not meant to deny the
committee's earlier memorandum. Willy Newberry, chairman of the Black
Student's Union, a member of the BUF, however, said that Cheatham's statement
"effectively invalidates" the previous memorandum, adding "it now carries little
or no weight." .
BAC has scheduled an 8 a.m. meeting this morning with the BUF to continue
discussions.

Stanford Hospital, and Willie Newberry of the BSU glare at each other as Sam
Bridges, recently fired hospital janitor, looks on. Vital e wanted to discuss the
minority demands, but Newberry would wait until Thomas Gonda, Hospital
Director, showed up for his alleged appointment 10 hours late.
About 45 persons were preparing to bed down on the second floor of Stanford
Hospital early this morning as a non-violent sit-in called to protest the firing of a
black hospital worker and five other employee grievances continued.
The group decided to remain overnight in the hospital corridor after an
hour-long meeting with Dr. Thomas Gonda, director of the hospital, resolved only
five of the protestor's six demands.
According to persons present at the late-night bargaining session, Dr. Gonda
refused to reinstate Sam Bridges, a black custodian at the hospital who was
recently fired on a variety of charges.
Gonda has scheduled another meeting with the group at 9 :30 a.m. today.
The sit-in began with a misunderstanding between the Black United Front
(BUF), a group representing Bridges, and Gonda.
About 80 members of the BUF and supporters of Bridges, claiming that they
had a 1 p.m. appointment with Gonda, marched to his office following a noon
rally at the steps of the Medical School.
