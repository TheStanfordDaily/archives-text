# Frog King, Refuse On Tap

### TODD McCARTHY 
Roberto Rossellini made "The
Rise of Louis XIV" for French
television in 1965 but his film has
just now arrived in Palo Alto,
where it opens tonight at the Paris
Theatre. Though not a
blockbuster, the film has been
surprisingly successful in its
theatrical bookings throughout
the country in that few projects
could at first seem less promising
commercially and that a new
Rossellini film hasn't appeared in
America in over a decade.
Fortunately, this renewed interest
in the father of neo-realism is
more than warranted.
What superficially distinguishes
"Louis XIV" from most other
historical dramas is its scope and
size. Traditionally Hollywood has
always seen fit to appropriate
millions of dollars to its period
pieces and to pictorially justify
the lavish expenditures through
senseless spectacle. The focal
points of these dramas-cum-epics
have been the imposing

confrontations of masses rather
than the inner workings of
important individuals. Indeed,
perhaps the greatest merit of
Rossellini's work is that it moves
as close to the individuals as it
can, catching the power plays at
their source rather than showing
their ultimate effect.
As Rossellini sees his subjects,
the king has virtually no private
life at all, as even rudimentary
human functions like sleeping,
eating and dressing have their own
elaborate accompanying rituals.
No less than two dozen subjects
are present when Louis awakens
in the morning and the trappings
of an extravagant feast are
consumed by the king alone under
the irritated but helpless eyes of
the full court. Beyond being
amusing in themselves, these and
other sequences are
psychologically telling in regard to
the monarch's gradual grasp of
power. From demanding
attendance at trivial ceremonies, it
was only a logical step for the

king to construct the sprawling
palace at Versailles, which not
only served as an extraordinary
symbol of opulence to the rest of
the world but effectively
contained potentially dangerous
subjects under the king's own
roof, away from their own
domains.
Straight History
What further distinguishes the
film Is that Rossellini looks at
history straight, neither trying to
make the story seem relevant to
modern times nor taking a
condescending stance toward
either his subject or his audience
(such as suggesting that we've
come a long way or that we
should learn by history's
example). In "A Man For All
Seasons" and"The Lion in
Winter" (both of which, perhaps
significantly, were originally
written for the stage), history was
viewed respectively as a moral
lesson and a contemporary
comedy, each with the mandatory
servings of aristocratic splendor
and servile squalor.
Just as Rossellini's work cannot
be faulted for either a lack or
over-abundance of visual detail, it
must be praised for its dry and
continual sense of humor. Much
of the credit for this must go to
Jean-Marie Patte, who plays
Louis. Patte at first appears
uniquely undistinguished both
physically and vocally but, in a
way not totally dissimilar to
Woody Allen, manages to gain
maximum dramatic and comic
mileage from his inherent
limitations. It's a remarkable
performance.
Rossellini has recently been
teaching film at Rice University
and an interesting footnote to his
career as an historical film-maker
is that just last week, he was
tentatively selected to make the
film commemorating America's
bi-centennial. — This aroused

considerable outrage in some
quarters and though the choice
initially struck me as somewhat
curious culturally, the evidence of
"Louis XIV" at least insures that
the result will be aesthetically
worthy, even if it isn't as
mindlessly patriotic as some might
have it.

Paul Morrissey's "Trash,"
currently at the Menlo, is neither
as entertaining or pure in form as
the same director's "Flesh," but
proves an interesting exercise in
camp and pop sociology. "Rolling
Stone" cover boy Joe Dallesandro
was emminently more watchable
as the hustler in last year's effort
than he is here as an eternally
limp junkie. Most of the acting
laurels have gone to Holly
Wood lawn (insiders have
speculated that Holly was not
nominated for an Oscar simply
because it wasn't clear whether
the appropriate category would be
Best Supporting Actor or
Actress), but my favorite
discovery was Jane Forth as an
eyebrow-less creature still freaky
enough for the Warholian realm
but affluent enough to have
gotten married and moved out of
the Village.
The link between "Trash" and
many domestic dramas of the
thirties lies in the characters'
common concern for raising
money enough to settle down to a
normal life. However, the specific
preoccupations of "Trash" diverge
decisively and perversely from
those of the thirties, as an uptight
welfare man is substituted for the
bread line and the income is
diverted towards heroin purchases
rather than to planning for a
family. And, of course, instead of
asking for a kiss, as Carole
Lombard might have asked Fred
Mac Murray, Holly ends the film
by querying, "Joe, can I blow
you?" Lubitsch it ain't.


FOXY LADY—Anne Heywood plays the ASSU Council of Presidents in her most revealing role to date,
in "The Fox," showing tonight at 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 at Cubberley. Harvey Hukari and Shirley
Temple Black will be tap-dancing on stage between shows.
