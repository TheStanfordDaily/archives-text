# Another Glance At Nostalgia
## 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
While the topic of America's
nostalgia has been given generous
attention by the national press,
observers reflect more on the
campy, affectionate atmosphere
that permeates this recycling of
non-existant rememberances; the
emphasis, it seems, more rightly
belongs on the pejorative
consequence of serving up a
breath of stale air to the American
public.
Nostalgists seem to be gaining
in strength. In last month's
Antoinette (Tony) Perry
presentations for New York
musicals, the 1 927 musical "No,
No Nanette" with graying but
lovely Ruby Keeler got a number
of nominations plus a winner or
two. The play makes no pretenses
to being contemporary, but rather
plays as a looking glass of how it
all once was. The musical is camp
for some. But not all.
The Easy Escape
There are many Americans,
who trying to escape the front
pages or the six o'clock news, turn
to these merchants of yesteryear
in an effort to touch out to a
reality that they thought was once
theirs. In the effort to make true
the maxim "progress is our most
important product" (R. Reagan,
1959 ) we have forgotten to make

clear our objective correlative:
progress for whom? Not only have
we been wrecking havoc on our
environment in the frenzy for
"progress" but we seem to have
left bits and pieces of our society
without any base from which to
tune into a compatible reality. So
it is that many people are not
tuning in to nostalgia with a gee
whiz, look how naive we all were,
rather, these forgotten people
stare into these cobweb
institutions hoping that from
them, they can sort meaning out
of a society in which they feel
they are mere trespassers.
Hidden Emptiness
This emptiness, both the source
as well as the result of nostalgia,
seems to mask itself in the
ostensibly "funny" institution of
camp entertainment. For
example, motion picture
companies like MGM or
Twentieth Century Fox make a
small but impressive fortune
selling various props from their
1930's & 1 940's extravaganzas.
Culminating the cinematic
souveniring was a $10,000
purchase of Scarlet O'Hara's
petticoat gown. Eccentria? Of
course, but such eccentricity
covers up other psychological
factors. Further, these public
auctions were not closed to the

antique elite, but were attended
by thousands of people.
The implication is not that,
from the collection of McGuire
Sisters albums or the regeneration
of period pieces from the theater
all America is catering to some
vague, usually nonexistant
conception of show it all was, but
that for some people, feeling
alientation from the beautiful
people, the Hard Hats, or other
erratic factions of the
technocracy, nostalgia offers a
way to get away from it all, to
comfortably slip into a pseudo
time when things were slower,
more enjoyable, perhaps more
meaningful.
We know that progress,
unchecked can be our worst
enemy. But homage to stagnacy,
reverance of nostalgia can likewise
function as a source of feebleness.
