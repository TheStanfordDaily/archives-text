# New Faces Album Shows Promise
## 
### JOHN BROHOLM 
Faces, Long Player
(Warner Bros. 1892)
Rod Stewart is the hoarse
genius whose singing for the Jeff
Beck Group drew critical applause
and album-cover hype such as
"vocals extraordinaire." Toward
the end of that sojourn, Stewart
cut an album without Beck which
was an artistic, if not commercial,
success, encouraging Stewart to
strike out on his own, away from
the egomaniacal guitar virtuoso
Beck.
Since then, in several albums,
Stewart has proven to be a
virtuoso of sorts himself. His
talents are his voice and the
capacity to hold together Faces, a
group of competent but by no
means brilliant musicians, knitting
together their individual efforts
into some of the best
country-rock around today.
The group is sometimes Faces,
and sometimes Rod Stewart with
backing musicians. Their fourth
album together, "Long Player," is
a sometimes driving, sometimes
lilting, and occasionally very
messed up exposition of their
talents.
Hard Rockers
The opening cuts on both
sides, "Bad'n'Ruin" and "Had Me
a Real Good Time," are hard
rockers of the first order, with
solid rhythm from bassist Ronnie
Lane and drummer Kenny Jones.
Lan McLagan's electric organ and
piano set up a tight and
sympathetic foundation for
Ronnie Woods well thought out
guitar breaks.
Stewart's arrangement in
"Good Time" utilizes one of his
favorite tricks—stopping the song
and doing the last verse with a
completely different arrangement,
an effective stunt when done well.
The vocals are Stewart's own
brand of gravelly, almost wispy
singing, providing the rallying
point for the others to work from.
Although most of the songs on
"Long Player" were written by
Stewart with various members of
Faces, the best cut is a Paul
McCartney effort, "Maybe I'm
Amazed." Stewart has always
fared excellently with other
people's material, notably Keith
Richards and Mick Jagger's
"Street Fighting Man" and Elton
John's "Country Comforts." Paul
gets comparable treatment, with a
new twist.
Lively Concert
The recording is from a live
concert, and it shows some
important things about Faces.
When they play, they are
together, and when they're
together, they're usually drunk,
the drunker the better.
"Maybe I'm Amazed" staggers
and sways around happily in a
fairly close approximation of
McCartney's own arrangement,
ending twice, and leaving Faces
quite proud of themselves. ("Just
about warming up and gettin' into
it right about here," Stewart

giddily informs the audience.)
Pass the wine bottle.
Stewart has said he plans to
find another group of backing
musicians to do his solo albums
with, concentrating on the slower
numbers, while he does the
rock'n'roll and hard blues with
Faces, but he seems not to have
made the break yet.
Mellow Blues
"Long Player" includes a
couple of fine slow bluesy cuts
along with the punchier rock. Ron
Lane's "Tell Everyone" is a
mellow blues number with
Stewart's hoarse singing out front,
and Wood stealing occasional
guitar licks from Eric Clapton.
"Sweet Lady Mary" is another
in a long line of Stewart's laments
for old loves. Wood turns it into
something special by weaving
languid steel guitar into
McLagan's organ backing, and
although the instrumental
wanders around for a long time, it
never really gets lost.
The major flaws in the album
occur when Stewart steps back
and lets Wood fool around with
the same riff on the bottleneck
guitar on three different songs.
Wood is a good guitarist, but no
wizard, and "Richmond" and "On
the Beach" are hurt by his
excesses, although he atones for
his sins by closing out the album
sweetly with "Jerusalem."
"Long Player" is one in a line
of steadily improving albums from
five good friends and good
musicians. They're already among
the finest, but I'm sure the best is
yet to come. The next time Faces
pay a visit to one of Bill Graham's
playgrounds, go see them. And
don't forget the wine bottle.

When they play, they are
together, and when they're
together, they're usually drunk,
the drunker the better.
"Maybe I'm Amazed" staggers
and sways around happily in a
fairly close approximation of
McCartney's own arrangement,
ending twice, and leaving Faces
quite proud of themselves. ("Just
about warming up and gettin' into
it right about here," Stewart

giddily informs the audience.)
Pass the wine bottle.
Stewart has said he plans to
find another group of backing
musicians to do his solo albums
with, concentrating on the slower
numbers, while he does the
rock'n'roll and hard blues with
Faces, but he seems not to have
made the break yet.
Mellow Blues
"Long Player" includes a
couple of fine slow bluesy cuts
along with the punchier rock. Ron
Lane's "Tell Everyone" is a
mellow blues number with
Stewart's hoarse singing out front,
and Wood stealing occasional
guitar licks from Eric Clapton.
"Sweet Lady Mary" is another
in a long line of Stewart's laments
for old loves. Wood turns it into
something special by weaving
languid steel guitar into
McLagan's organ backing, and
although the instrumental
wanders around for a long time, it
never really gets lost.
The major flaws in the album
occur when Stewart steps back
and lets Wood fool around with
the same riff on the bottleneck
guitar on three different songs.
Wood is a good guitarist, but no
wizard, and "Richmond" and "On
the Beach" are hurt by his
excesses, although he atones for
his sins by closing out the album
sweetly with "Jerusalem."
"Long Player" is one in a line
of steadily improving albums from
five good friends and good
musicians. They're already among
the finest, but I'm sure the best is
yet to come. The next time Faces
pay a visit to one of Bill Graham's
playgrounds, go see them. And
don't forget the wine bottle.
Faces, Long Player
(Warner Bros. 1892)
Rod Stewart is the hoarse
genius whose singing for the Jeff
Beck Group drew critical applause
and album-cover hype such as
"vocals extraordinaire." Toward
the end of that sojourn, Stewart
cut an album without Beck which
was an artistic, if not commercial,
success, encouraging Stewart to
strike out on his own, away from
the egomaniacal guitar virtuoso
Beck.
Since then, in several albums,
Stewart has proven to be a
virtuoso of sorts himself. His
talents are his voice and the
capacity to hold together Faces, a
group of competent but by no
means brilliant musicians, knitting
together their individual efforts
into some of the best
country-rock around today.
The group is sometimes Faces,
and sometimes Rod Stewart with
backing musicians. Their fourth
album together, "Long Player," is
a sometimes driving, sometimes
lilting, and occasionally very
messed up exposition of their
talents.
Hard Rockers
The opening cuts on both
sides, "Bad'n'Ruin" and "Had Me
a Real Good Time," are hard
rockers of the first order, with
solid rhythm from bassist Ronnie
Lane and drummer Kenny Jones.
Lan McLagan's electric organ and
piano set up a tight and
sympathetic foundation for
Ronnie Woods well thought out
guitar breaks.
Stewart's arrangement in
"Good Time" utilizes one of his
favorite tricks—stopping the song
and doing the last verse with a
completely different arrangement,
an effective stunt when done well.
The vocals are Stewart's own
brand of gravelly, almost wispy
singing, providing the rallying
point for the others to work from.
Although most of the songs on
"Long Player" were written by
Stewart with various members of
Faces, the best cut is a Paul
McCartney effort, "Maybe I'm
Amazed." Stewart has always
fared excellently with other
people's material, notably Keith
Richards and Mick Jagger's
"Street Fighting Man" and Elton
John's "Country Comforts." Paul
gets comparable treatment, with a
new twist.
Lively Concert
The recording is from a live
concert, and it shows some
important things about Faces.
When they play, they are
together, and when they're
together, they're usually drunk,
the drunker the better.
"Maybe I'm Amazed" staggers
