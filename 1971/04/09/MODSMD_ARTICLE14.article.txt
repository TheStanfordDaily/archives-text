# ACT's 'President' Unpolished
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The American Conservatory
Theater opened its final
production of the season last
week with the world premiere of a
new musical, "The Selling of the
President."
This is ACT's only new entry
this year, and it's really not
surprising that it is not as polished
or as tight as the other shows you
may have seen, because "Selling
of the President" is not a finished
product.
It is, in effect, a pre-Broadway
try-out, and so is certain to be
rough around the edges, and
perhaps a little loose around the
middle. Most of the shows that
find their way into the ACT
repertoire are plays that have been
tested before hundreds of
audiences and improved where
necessary. These shows have
satisfied the producers, directors,
writers, and audiences that they
are as good as they are ever likely
to be.
This is the process that "The
Selling of the President" will be
going through in the next few
months, before it sees the
Broadway stage, and Clive Barnes
of The New York Times decides
whether it should live or die.
From what I have seen (and I
hasten to add that I have had
almost no experience with
pre-Broadway shows), "The
Selling of the President" has a
pretty good chance of being at
least a moderate success.
It is a political satire based on
Joe McGinniss' book of the same
title, and chronicles the television
sales campaign that is responsible
for the election of the president in
1976. With the public attitude
towards politics becoming more
and more cynical, a show that
presents the American public as

being the victims of politicians is
bound to have popular appeal.
The music is generally pleasant,
if not inspred, with a nice mixture
of current styles, and an
occasional Richard Rodgers-type
melody for those over forty who
like to remember. The lyrics are
often clever, and in some
instances, incisive and telling.
The dialogue is virtually
non-existent, as are character
development and plot. This is the
biggest problem the show must
solve. It is billed as "A Musical
Vaudeville," which is either the
reason or the excuse for the
hangloose, disconnected feeling
that pervades it.
It is a play only in the freest
sense of the word; it is more
nearly a series of vignettes, with
song. Some of the vignettes are
funnier than others, some of the
songs are better than others. In
the next few months Director
Ellis Rabb, Writer Stuart Hample,
and Composer-Lyricists Bob
James and Jack O'Brien will be
working to pull it together where
it is unbearably loose, make the
dull parts funny, and substitute
good songs for the bad ones. Until
then, it will be a half-finished
product, pleasant to see and
occasionally quite entertaining.
Ellis Rabb's direction seemed

rather hectic, which is
understandable considering he had
to coordinate 19 actors, 23
musical numbers, eight musicians,
and a score of film sequences by
American Zoetrope projected on
three screens.
Because there is no character
development, it is hard to single
out any performers as being
particularly good or bad. Peter
Donat plays George Mason, a
thoroughly underwhelming
candidate in the Nixon mode,
with typical Nixonian gestures,
speech patterns, idealogy, wife,
and dog. Michael Learned is his
cynical campaign manager,
assisted by Josef Sommer, Scott
Thomas and Joseph Bird. William
Paterson plays the Reverend
Norman Billy Emerson, the
candidate's spiritual front-man,
and Martin Berman is Marty
"Smiles" Faranghetti, a Soupy
Sales-style ambassador to the
teen-age vote bloc.
Award for most consistently
dazzling performance goes to Ann
Weldon, as Canibus Sativa, who
just belts or coos one song after
another with style and class.
Award for most inspired single
comedy bit goes to G. Wood as
Captain Terror, a kiddie-show
sadist who garners votes for the
candidate by threatening to turn

his young viewers into frogs if
they don't tell Mommy and
Daddy to vote the correct line.
And award for the most "out"
joke in a San Francisco opening

goes to the man who named the
candidate's wife Gracie Mason,
which will be hilarious in New
York, but nowhere else. (Stiff
upper lip, Mr. Lindsay!)


FOR SALE OR RENT—One president, at the ACT, which is currently
showing "The Selling of the President." These two lovable fellows arc
known as Hekle and Jekyll, and one of them is an evangelist and one
is Soupy Sales. Guess who?

his young viewers into frogs if
they don't tell Mommy and
Daddy to vote the correct line.

joke in a San Francisco opening

goes to the man who named the
candidate's wife Gracie Mason,

FOR SALE OR RENT—One president, at the ACT, which is currently
showing "The Selling of the President." These two lovable fellows arc
known as Hekle and Jekyll, and one of them is an evangelist and one
is Soupy Sales. Guess who?
The American Conservatory
Theater opened its final
production of the season last
week with the world premiere of a
new musical, "The Selling of the
President."
This is ACT's only new entry
this year, and it's really not
surprising that it is not as polished
or as tight as the other shows you
may have seen, because "Selling
of the President" is not a finished
product.
It is, in effect, a pre-Broadway
try-out, and so is certain to be
rough around the edges, and
perhaps a little loose around the
middle. Most of the shows that
find their way into the ACT
repertoire are plays that have been
tested before hundreds of
audiences and improved where
necessary. These shows have
satisfied the producers, directors,
writers, and audiences that they
are as good as they are ever likely
to be.
This is the process that "The
Selling of the President" will be
going through in the next few
months, before it sees the
Broadway stage, and Clive Barnes
of The New York Times decides
whether it should live or die.
From what I have seen (and I
hasten to add that I have had
almost no experience with
pre-Broadway shows), "The
Selling of the President" has a
pretty good chance of being at
least a moderate success.
It is a political satire based on
Joe McGinniss' book of the same
title, and chronicles the television
sales campaign that is responsible
for the election of the president in
1976. With the public attitude
towards politics becoming more
and more cynical, a show that
presents the American public as

being the victims of politicians is
bound to have popular appeal.
The music is generally pleasant,
if not inspred, with a nice mixture
of current styles, and an
occasional Richard Rodgers-type
melody for those over forty who
like to remember. The lyrics are
often clever, and in some
instances, incisive and telling.
The dialogue is virtually
non-existent, as are character
development and plot. This is the
biggest problem the show must
solve. It is billed as "A Musical
Vaudeville," which is either the
reason or the excuse for the
hangloose, disconnected feeling
that pervades it.
It is a play only in the freest
sense of the word; it is more
nearly a series of vignettes, with
song. Some of the vignettes are
funnier than others, some of the
songs are better than others. In
the next few months Director
Ellis Rabb, Writer Stuart Hample,
and Composer-Lyricists Bob
James and Jack O'Brien will be
working to pull it together where
it is unbearably loose, make the
dull parts funny, and substitute
good songs for the bad ones. Until
then, it will be a half-finished
product, pleasant to see and
occasionally quite entertaining.
Ellis Rabb's direction seemed

rather hectic, which is
understandable considering he had
to coordinate 19 actors, 23
musical numbers, eight musicians,
and a score of film sequences by
American Zoetrope projected on
three screens.
Because there is no character
development, it is hard to single
out any performers as being
particularly good or bad. Peter
Donat plays George Mason, a
thoroughly underwhelming
candidate in the Nixon mode,
with typical Nixonian gestures,
speech patterns, idealogy, wife,
and dog. Michael Learned is his
cynical campaign manager,
assisted by Josef Sommer, Scott
Thomas and Joseph Bird. William
Paterson plays the Reverend
Norman Billy Emerson, the
candidate's spiritual front-man,
and Martin Berman is Marty
"Smiles" Faranghetti, a Soupy
Sales-style ambassador to the
teen-age vote bloc.
Award for most consistently
dazzling performance goes to Ann
Weldon, as Canibus Sativa, who
just belts or coos one song after
another with style and class.
Award for most inspired single
comedy bit goes to G. Wood as
Captain Terror, a kiddie-show
sadist who garners votes for the
candidate by threatening to turn

his young viewers into frogs if
they don't tell Mommy and
Daddy to vote the correct line.
And award for the most "out"
