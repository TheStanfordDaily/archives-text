# Tresidder Boycott Spreads
## 
### BOB BACON 
The boycott of Tresidder
Memorial Union grew briefly
Wednesday to include the Faculty
Club, when a group of about
fifteen Venceremos members and
supporters briefly occupied the
lobby of the club during the noon
hour after placing a picket line at
the rear gate. They left peacefully
after ten minutes.
Meanwhile, the picket line and
accompanying Alternate Food
Service continued at Tresidder.
The boycotters claimed that they
have hurt the Union seriously,
while Union Director Forrest
Tregea was uncertain as to its
effects. The boycott seeks the
re-hiring of twelve employees laid
off at Tresidder last month.
The incident at the club began
shortly after 12:30, when the
demonstrators abandoned their
picket line and entered the lobby
of the building. They were met by

Tregea, who also serves as club
manager. He told them they were
on private property and twice
asked them to leave. He also asked
several demonstrators for
identification. They refused both
requests.
Quiet Confrontation
Tregea then told the group that
if they did not leave, he would
"have to report it." Shortly
thereafter two Stanford police
officers arrived, but they did not
take part in the discussion
between Tregea and the
demonstrators.
The doors to the club dining
room were closed and members
inside did not see the
confrontation.
After ten minutes, the group
left the building and returned to
Tresidder at the suggestion of
their leaders. The police officers
then stationed themselves outside
the club entrance.
Boycott Continues
Meanwhile, at the Union, Joe
Hardegree of the United Campus
Ministry, a leader of the boycott,
claimed that the effort had hurt
Tresidder's business "very
seriously." Director Tregea,
however, was uncertain as to the
boycott's effects; he noted that
the Union's business has been
about 20% below 1969-70 since

the beginning of the school
year. Each side in the
controversy claimed harassment
by the other. Hardegree said that
TMU officials had made life
difficult for his group, while
Tregea noted that many of his
employees were "upset and
concerned" by what they
perceived to be threats from the
boy cotters.
Attempt to Block Deliveries
Tuesday the pickets again
sought to block delivery of food
to the Union; one driver
summoned a police officer before
attempting to unload. Hardegree
told the Daily that this tactic was
less successful now than it had
been last week.
Santa Clara County health
inspectors have visited the
Alternate Food Service twice.
According to Tregea, the
inspectors warned the boycotters
that they were violating the law
by operating a food service
without a permit. Th? boycotters,
however, claimed that they made
adjustments in their procedure to
statisfy the authorities.
Hardegree said that, the
boycott has become a "waiting
game;" his organization will
continue the picketing "for as
long as necessary" to reinstate the
twelve laid-off workers.
