# Stanford Glides Past San Diego State, 9-3
## 
### TOM QUINN 
Phil Kelber led a rejuvenated
Stanford hitting attack with three
hits and three RBl's to clobber
visiting San Diego State, 9-3, at
Sunken Diamond on Thursday.
The junior third baseman
celebrated his return to the lineup
with two singles and a double in
four trips to propel Stanford to its
24 th victory of the year.
Freshman left-hander Bob Di
Pietro went all the way for
Stanford on the mound and
recorded his second victory
against no defeats. Di Pietro
allowed only six hits while
striking out five.
Shortstop A 1 O'Brien aided the
Indian cause with his first home
run of the year, a solo blast in the
second inning. Sophomore Rod
Boone also kept his hitting steak
alive with a single in the sixth.
On Wednesday, the Indians
registered their 23 rd victory of
the season behind the talented
arm of Bob Marshall. When the
Stanford offensive attack

sputtered, Marshall took charge
and whipped Chapman College,
1-0.
Marshall had a no-hitter for
seven and two-thirds innings and
eventually wound up allowing
only three meaningless hits en
route to his third win to the
season against no defeats. The
Stanford attack offered its sole
output in the fourth inning on the
Rod Boone's single, a passed ball,
and a sacrifice fly by Mark
Lucich.
Dan Shaw will get the starting
nod for the Indians against
California at home tomorrow to
open the PAC- season. Shaw has
been one of the workhorses on
the mound for the Cards this year,
hurling his way to seven victories
in ten decisions and posting an
outstanding 1.35 ERA.
Coach Ray Young is wary of
the Bears' team batting average of
.273 and its potential. Though Cal
hasn't quite as impressive as the
Indians' 24-10-1 slate, the Bears
top the .500 mark.


TOP SENIOR—Stan Pasarell, whose addition to the team helped the
Tribe return from SoCal with a big win over USC, will compete for
the Indians tomorrow against Cal at Berkeley. Stanford skunked
Seattle on Wednesday, 9-0.
