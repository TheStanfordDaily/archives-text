# McHenry, Hocker Make Run-Off
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Results of the student election last
night indicate that the slate of Chris
Hocker and Robin Friedman and the
McHenry-Fields-Kimball-Diamond will
oppose each other in run-off elections next
week.
The run-off elections will be held
Wednesday and Thursday, April 14 and
15.
Returns late last night showed
McHenry-Fields receiving 965 votes;
Hocker-Friedman 718; Winslow-Swent
505; Whitesides-Bardet 479;
Plow-Baker 170; Single 34.
Hocker, one of the candidates in the
run-off, expressed surprise at his slate's
success. Friedman, his running-mate,
released this statement:
"Chris and I believe that the low

voter turnout was a fair indicator of the
antipathy of the Stanford student
toward student government.
Henry Sayre, campaign manager for
the McHenry ticket, released the
following statement on behalf of the
four members of the McHenry slate:
"We are disappointed that so many
students appear to have voted for $0 in
an effort either to remove themselves
from any responsibility to the
community or to eradicate the long
fought for and recently gained power
of groups like the Black Students
Union.
A moderate showing of about 3200
students gave 705 votes to $0, and 474
to $3. The final choice between the
two will be made in next week's
elections.

Of possibly great significance for the
Stanford community was a proposal to
prohibit recruiting by the military,
which seems to have a slim majority.
The same held true for a proposal
which would deny the use of Stanford
lands to any corporation "directly
producing" war materiel, as laid down
by a committee of Stanford faculty,
staff, and students.
Two amendments to the ASSU
constitution, both requiring a
two-thirds majority were on the ballot.
One measure to reapportion seats in the
student Senate so that students would
be elected directly by their living areas
was defeated.
The voluntary banking amendment
seems to have received its two-thirds
majority. It would allow student
organizations not receiving funds from
the ASSU to deposit their funds in
outside accounts.
A controversial bill which would
have laid down exact allocations for
certain student organizations in the
Senate's budget next year passed
1516-1134.
To no one's surprise, the proposal
which would give the Stanford Band
two dollars from each student next and
won handily by a two-to-one margin.
Returns on a student assessment of
four dollars per academic year for the
Daily passed by a much more narrow
margin. The fee represents an increase
of one dollar over last year.
Two peace proposals, one a treaty
between the people of the United

States and Vietnam, and the other a
referendum on withdrawing all
American troops from Southeast Asia
by the end of this year, both obtained
easy majorities.
The Committee of Fifteen was asked
to examine legislation providing greater
student power in Stanford judicial
processes by a significant number of
those voting.
The elections next week will give the
student body the opportunity to make
a final choice on the ASSU presidential
slate and fee assessments. At the same
time three new student members for
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) will be picked.

Two amendments to the ASSU
constitution, both requiring a
two-thirds majority were on the ballot.
One measure to reapportion seats in the
student Senate so that students would
be elected directly by their living areas
was defeated.
The voluntary banking amendment
seems to have received its two-thirds
majority. It would allow student
organizations not receiving funds from
the ASSU to deposit their funds in
outside accounts.
A controversial bill which would
have laid down exact allocations for
certain student organizations in the
Senate's budget next year passed
1516-1134.
To no one's surprise, the proposal
which would give the Stanford Band
two dollars from each student next and
won handily by a two-to-one margin.
Returns on a student assessment of
four dollars per academic year for the
Daily passed by a much more narrow
margin. The fee represents an increase
of one dollar over last year.
Two peace proposals, one a treaty
between the people of the United

States and Vietnam, and the other a
referendum on withdrawing all
American troops from Southeast Asia
by the end of this year, both obtained
easy majorities.
The Committee of Fifteen was asked
to examine legislation providing greater
student power in Stanford judicial
processes by a significant number of
those voting.
The elections next week will give the
student body the opportunity to make
a final choice on the ASSU presidential
slate and fee assessments. At the same
time three new student members for
the Student Conduct Legislative
Council (SCLC) will be picked.
Results of the student election last
night indicate that the slate of Chris
Hocker and Robin Friedman and the
McHenry-Fields-Kimball-Diamond will
oppose each other in run-off elections next
week.
The run-off elections will be held
Wednesday and Thursday, April 14 and
15.
Returns late last night showed
McHenry-Fields receiving 965 votes;
Hocker-Friedman 718; Winslow-Swent
505; Whitesides-Bardet 479;
Plow-Baker 170; Single 34.
Hocker, one of the candidates in the
run-off, expressed surprise at his slate's
success. Friedman, his running-mate,
released this statement:
"Chris and I believe that the low

voter turnout was a fair indicator of the
antipathy of the Stanford student
toward student government.
Henry Sayre, campaign manager for
the McHenry ticket, released the
following statement on behalf of the
four members of the McHenry slate:
"We are disappointed that so many
students appear to have voted for $0 in
an effort either to remove themselves
from any responsibility to the
community or to eradicate the long
fought for and recently gained power
of groups like the Black Students
Union.
A moderate showing of about 3200
students gave 705 votes to $0, and 474
to $3. The final choice between the
two will be made in next week's
elections.

Of possibly great significance for the
Stanford community was a proposal to
prohibit recruiting by the military,
which seems to have a slim majority.
The same held true for a proposal
which would deny the use of Stanford
lands to any corporation "directly
producing" war materiel, as laid down
by a committee of Stanford faculty,
staff, and students.
