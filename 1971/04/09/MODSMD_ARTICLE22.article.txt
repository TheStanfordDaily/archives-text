Following is the text of an address to the
Academic Council, April 2, 1971, by William F.
Miller, Stanford vice president and provost:
Now is the time lor us to take stock of where
we stand and where we shall go with our aca
demic programs. A number of us have been
engaged in national, regional, and topical studies
of academic needs and academic directions. We
must now look more closely and sharply at what
these studies mean to Stanford. We move from
problems of developing a plan for higher educa
tion, in general, to developing a plan for Stan
ford that will carry us through the next decade.
To be sure, we cannot, nor should we, ignore the
forces at work on higher education nationwide.
But, we must turn to our problems, set our
goals, and develop our implementation of these
goals.
Most institutions of higher education have
been going through an identity crisis in the past
few years, and we are no exception. 1 think we
have suffered less in this regard than many, but
ii is time to find ourselves and choose our
course. In my discussions with faculty, and 1
have extensive discussions in the past few weeks,
1 sense a reaffirmation and a return of interest in
academic goals.
Of the many forces at work on institutions of
higher education, there are some to which Stan
ford should respond, and there are sortie to
which we should not. We have our own history,
we have our own setting, and, no doubt, we shall
find opportunities that will be unique to us.
In speaking of the many forces at work, we
are all acutely aware of the great financial pres
sures on every institution of higher education in
this country. We are aware of public opinion,
both as to how we conduct ourselves and for
what purposes we conduct ourselves.
There are significant changes in the life style
of students, both before and after their gradua
tion. There are new diverse career opportunities
open to graduates that effect their choices of
universities and their paths through these institu
tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the
benefit of experience outside of the University.
This phenomenon generates a degree of isola
tion of the faculty from the world around them
and will have an impact on the type of academic
programs that arc possible for a faculty of that
composition. There are increasing pressures for
us to undertake teaching, research, and service
programs only remotely related to our tradi
tional academic goals.
To which of these forces should we respond,
and which may we reasonably ignore?
Even though large private universities, such as
Stanford, are heavily dependent upon public
funds, ve still have some options left as a private
institution. We should exercise these options to
maximize our contribution to higher education,
consistent with goals and ambitions of our
faculty and students.
It is perfectly clear to me that no one person
is going to shape the course of the academic
programs of Stanford University. Any set of

ideas will be altered by critique and refined by
discourse before moving to implementation.
However, 1 should like to share some thoughts
which are foremost in my mind and to introduce
some ideas which I believe need close considera
tion, as well as to indicate some of the mechan
isms by which your ideas as well as mine will be
properly examined and the means by which they
may be realized.
First and foremost, 1 believe that "intellectual
growth" is our raison d'etre. Our societal respon
sibility is to the generation of new knowledge,
articulation of new perceptions, and the devel
opment of new capabilities in people—scholar
ship and teaching. Ours must be a commitment
to the future. We are uniquely prepared to play
this role. There are many immediate concerns
which we cannot fail to heed, but to abandon
our commitment to future generations would
impact us even in our own lifetimes and clearly
within the lifetimes of our current student body.
We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.
Secondly, it is essential, and fortunately still
possible, for us to put a high emphasis on the
quality of education. As I indicated earlier,
choices for a given institution should be made in
the context of its history as well as its vision of
future opportunities. Stanford has developed it
self to a capability for providing a very high
quality of education; to abandon that goal now
would be to abandon a carefully developed
resources at a time when it will be desperately
needed and perhaps rarely available. To be sure,
it is important that we find the means to bring
this high quality education to large numbers of
people who can benefit from the opportunities
of such an education and for whom these oppor
tunities have not been readily available in the
past. 1 speak now of women, timethnic minori
ties, and the economically deprived.
From these general considerations 1 shall turn
to more specific ones that may affect our under
graduate and graduate programs. First, I see two
trends that may impact our undergraduate cur
ricula. 1 believe that we may anticipate an in
creasing movement in post-graduate education
toward attendance in the professional schools,
that is the schools of law, business, medicine and
education. I believe also that we may anticipate
a trend of delaying post-graduate education
acquiring a few years of work experience before
returning lo formal education. Included in this
trend toward the professions will be not only
students from general study curricula, but also
students from engineering and the sciences,
proceeding lo graduate studies in medicine, law
and business.
Both of these trends suggest to me a need for
change in the character of our undergraduate
education. By far the most important qualities
are those intellectual capabilities which lead to
precision of llioughl and expression and lo the
ability to abstract and conceptualize. We need to
reexamine our basic courses to make certain that
they sharpen these intellectual techniques.
In addition lo Ibis, however, I believe these
trends of switching goals and delaying graduate
education sneak to the need for some courses

that prepare the baccalaureate graduate for
employment upon graduation. Thus, the under
graduate curriculum should have available to it
some general problem-solving courses as well as
courses to provide the students with talent that
could be valuable immediately upon graduation.
Not only would such a curriculum permit the
baccalaureate graduate to experience work activ
ities before going to graduate school, but it
would also have a significant psychological
impact on students who will go immediately to
graduate school.
A student need not feel trapped in the cur
riculum. feeling that his only choice is to
"grind" right on through the graduate school.
Having that option may be quite important to
many students, whether or not they exercise it.
Another curriculum change that should be
considered to meet this particular need is the
so-called "three plus two" plan. This is a five
year curriculum with three years of generalized
undergraduate study and two years of special
ized study that leads to a master's degree. Such a
plan would require more serious attention to the
master's degree than has heretofore been given it
by some of our schools and departments.
Let me turn briefly to our graduate programs,
in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.
In the lew remaining minutes, let me speak on
how Stanford I diversity might respond to the
desire and need for change in its academic pro
grams. It is perhaps worth pointing out that in
the past academic institutions have changed on a
premise of growth. It is lar easier to make
changes iu ;i growth situation, and while we may
experience some slow growth, we will certainly
not experience the rapid growth of tin- last

twenty years. We shall have to seek our changi
by turnover of faculty and more careful plan
ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU
underway to see what are the implications of
longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.
1 should like to point out that we have two
budgetary instruments for innovation and
change. We have recommended in the 1971-72
year budget two funds; one called the University
Progress Fund, and the other called the Research
Development Fund, each in the amount of
$200,000. These are intended to pro\idc I lie
budgetary instruments for initiation of new
teaching and new research programs. When \ on
consider that these amounts must cover much of
the innovative needs of the University, they aic
small amounts, indeed. Nonetheless, the\ do
provide us an opportunity. As soon as the Hoard
of Trustees has made final acceptance of de
budget, which should occur at the April
meeting, 1 shall publish the guidelines for utiliza
tion of these two funds.
Most of our schools are currently engaged in a
degree of intersehool planning, and there ire
programs across the schools which are also in (In
planning stages. In order to bring together tin <
plans and look at them in tin' context of the
entire University, I plan to hold a retreat with
the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com
ment. 1 sense on the part of the faculty an caj'.ei
ncss to return to and put new lite into Mir
academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!
leaders and faculty that there is an indication ot
return to study on the part of both und< i
graduates and graduates. Even if this inelinali' n
is only slight, we must capture the spirit ot 11,I 1, !
movement. If we fail, we will not ha\e been in •
to ourselves or to our students.
Thank you for the opportunity to li.t\«
opened this conversation. I will look loiuai*' to

in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.
In the lew remaining minutes, let me speak on
how Stanford I diversity might respond to the
desire and need for change in its academic pro
grams. It is perhaps worth pointing out that in
the past academic institutions have changed on a
premise of growth. It is lar easier to make
changes iu ;i growth situation, and while we may
experience some slow growth, we will certainly
not experience the rapid growth of tin- last

twenty years. We shall have to seek our changi
by turnover of faculty and more careful plan
ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU
underway to see what are the implications of
longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.
1 should like to point out that we have two
budgetary instruments for innovation and
change. We have recommended in the 1971-72
year budget two funds; one called the University
Progress Fund, and the other called the Research
Development Fund, each in the amount of
$200,000. These are intended to pro\idc I lie
budgetary instruments for initiation of new
teaching and new research programs. When \ on
consider that these amounts must cover much of
the innovative needs of the University, they aic
small amounts, indeed. Nonetheless, the\ do
provide us an opportunity. As soon as the Hoard
of Trustees has made final acceptance of de
budget, which should occur at the April
meeting, 1 shall publish the guidelines for utiliza
tion of these two funds.
Most of our schools are currently engaged in a
degree of intersehool planning, and there ire
programs across the schools which are also in (In
planning stages. In order to bring together tin <
plans and look at them in tin' context of the
entire University, I plan to hold a retreat with
the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com
ment. 1 sense on the part of the faculty an caj'.ei
ncss to return to and put new lite into Mir
academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!

graduates and graduates. Even if this inelinali' n

Following is the text of an address to the
Academic Council, April 2, 1971, by William F.
Miller, Stanford vice president and provost:
Now is the time lor us to take stock of where
we stand and where we shall go with our aca
demic programs. A number of us have been
engaged in national, regional, and topical studies
of academic needs and academic directions. We
must now look more closely and sharply at what
these studies mean to Stanford. We move from
problems of developing a plan for higher educa
tion, in general, to developing a plan for Stan
ford that will carry us through the next decade.
To be sure, we cannot, nor should we, ignore the
forces at work on higher education nationwide.
But, we must turn to our problems, set our
goals, and develop our implementation of these
goals.
Most institutions of higher education have
been going through an identity crisis in the past
few years, and we are no exception. 1 think we
have suffered less in this regard than many, but
ii is time to find ourselves and choose our
course. In my discussions with faculty, and 1
have extensive discussions in the past few weeks,
1 sense a reaffirmation and a return of interest in
academic goals.
Of the many forces at work on institutions of
higher education, there are some to which Stan
ford should respond, and there are sortie to
which we should not. We have our own history,
we have our own setting, and, no doubt, we shall
find opportunities that will be unique to us.
In speaking of the many forces at work, we
are all acutely aware of the great financial pres
sures on every institution of higher education in
this country. We are aware of public opinion,
both as to how we conduct ourselves and for
what purposes we conduct ourselves.
There are significant changes in the life style
of students, both before and after their gradua
tion. There are new diverse career opportunities
open to graduates that effect their choices of
universities and their paths through these institu
tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the
benefit of experience outside of the University.
This phenomenon generates a degree of isola
tion of the faculty from the world around them
and will have an impact on the type of academic
programs that arc possible for a faculty of that
composition. There are increasing pressures for
us to undertake teaching, research, and service
programs only remotely related to our tradi
tional academic goals.
To which of these forces should we respond,
and which may we reasonably ignore?
Even though large private universities, such as
Stanford, are heavily dependent upon public
funds, ve still have some options left as a private
institution. We should exercise these options to
maximize our contribution to higher education,
consistent with goals and ambitions of our
faculty and students.
It is perfectly clear to me that no one person
is going to shape the course of the academic
programs of Stanford University. Any set of

ideas will be altered by critique and refined by
discourse before moving to implementation.
However, 1 should like to share some thoughts
which are foremost in my mind and to introduce
some ideas which I believe need close considera
tion, as well as to indicate some of the mechan
isms by which your ideas as well as mine will be
properly examined and the means by which they
may be realized.
First and foremost, 1 believe that "intellectual
growth" is our raison d'etre. Our societal respon
sibility is to the generation of new knowledge,
articulation of new perceptions, and the devel
opment of new capabilities in people—scholar
ship and teaching. Ours must be a commitment
to the future. We are uniquely prepared to play
this role. There are many immediate concerns
which we cannot fail to heed, but to abandon
our commitment to future generations would
impact us even in our own lifetimes and clearly
within the lifetimes of our current student body.
We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.
Secondly, it is essential, and fortunately still
possible, for us to put a high emphasis on the
quality of education. As I indicated earlier,
choices for a given institution should be made in
the context of its history as well as its vision of
future opportunities. Stanford has developed it
self to a capability for providing a very high
quality of education; to abandon that goal now
would be to abandon a carefully developed
resources at a time when it will be desperately
needed and perhaps rarely available. To be sure,
it is important that we find the means to bring
this high quality education to large numbers of
people who can benefit from the opportunities
of such an education and for whom these oppor
tunities have not been readily available in the
past. 1 speak now of women, timethnic minori
ties, and the economically deprived.
From these general considerations 1 shall turn
to more specific ones that may affect our under
graduate and graduate programs. First, I see two
trends that may impact our undergraduate cur
ricula. 1 believe that we may anticipate an in
creasing movement in post-graduate education
toward attendance in the professional schools,
that is the schools of law, business, medicine and
education. I believe also that we may anticipate
a trend of delaying post-graduate education
acquiring a few years of work experience before
returning lo formal education. Included in this
trend toward the professions will be not only
students from general study curricula, but also
students from engineering and the sciences,
proceeding lo graduate studies in medicine, law
and business.
Both of these trends suggest to me a need for
change in the character of our undergraduate
education. By far the most important qualities
are those intellectual capabilities which lead to
precision of llioughl and expression and lo the
ability to abstract and conceptualize. We need to
reexamine our basic courses to make certain that
they sharpen these intellectual techniques.
In addition lo Ibis, however, I believe these
trends of switching goals and delaying graduate
education sneak to the need for some courses

that prepare the baccalaureate graduate for
employment upon graduation. Thus, the under
graduate curriculum should have available to it
some general problem-solving courses as well as
courses to provide the students with talent that
could be valuable immediately upon graduation.
Not only would such a curriculum permit the
baccalaureate graduate to experience work activ
ities before going to graduate school, but it
would also have a significant psychological
impact on students who will go immediately to
graduate school.
A student need not feel trapped in the cur
riculum. feeling that his only choice is to
"grind" right on through the graduate school.
Having that option may be quite important to
many students, whether or not they exercise it.
Another curriculum change that should be
considered to meet this particular need is the
so-called "three plus two" plan. This is a five
year curriculum with three years of generalized
undergraduate study and two years of special
ized study that leads to a master's degree. Such a
plan would require more serious attention to the
master's degree than has heretofore been given it
by some of our schools and departments.
Let me turn briefly to our graduate programs,
in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.

tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the
benefit of experience outside of the University.
This phenomenon generates a degree of isola
tion of the faculty from the world around them
and will have an impact on the type of academic
programs that arc possible for a faculty of that
composition. There are increasing pressures for
us to undertake teaching, research, and service
programs only remotely related to our tradi
tional academic goals.
To which of these forces should we respond,
and which may we reasonably ignore?
Even though large private universities, such as
Stanford, are heavily dependent upon public
funds, ve still have some options left as a private
institution. We should exercise these options to
maximize our contribution to higher education,
consistent with goals and ambitions of our
faculty and students.
It is perfectly clear to me that no one person
is going to shape the course of the academic
programs of Stanford University. Any set of

ideas will be altered by critique and refined by
discourse before moving to implementation.
However, 1 should like to share some thoughts
which are foremost in my mind and to introduce
some ideas which I believe need close considera
tion, as well as to indicate some of the mechan
isms by which your ideas as well as mine will be
properly examined and the means by which they
may be realized.
First and foremost, 1 believe that "intellectual
growth" is our raison d'etre. Our societal respon
sibility is to the generation of new knowledge,
articulation of new perceptions, and the devel
opment of new capabilities in people—scholar
ship and teaching. Ours must be a commitment
to the future. We are uniquely prepared to play
this role. There are many immediate concerns
which we cannot fail to heed, but to abandon
our commitment to future generations would
impact us even in our own lifetimes and clearly
within the lifetimes of our current student body.
We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.
Secondly, it is essential, and fortunately still
possible, for us to put a high emphasis on the
quality of education. As I indicated earlier,
choices for a given institution should be made in
the context of its history as well as its vision of
future opportunities. Stanford has developed it
self to a capability for providing a very high
quality of education; to abandon that goal now
would be to abandon a carefully developed
resources at a time when it will be desperately
needed and perhaps rarely available. To be sure,
it is important that we find the means to bring
this high quality education to large numbers of
people who can benefit from the opportunities
of such an education and for whom these oppor
tunities have not been readily available in the
past. 1 speak now of women, timethnic minori
ties, and the economically deprived.
From these general considerations 1 shall turn
to more specific ones that may affect our under
graduate and graduate programs. First, I see two
trends that may impact our undergraduate cur
ricula. 1 believe that we may anticipate an in
creasing movement in post-graduate education
toward attendance in the professional schools,
that is the schools of law, business, medicine and
education. I believe also that we may anticipate
a trend of delaying post-graduate education
acquiring a few years of work experience before
returning lo formal education. Included in this
trend toward the professions will be not only
students from general study curricula, but also
students from engineering and the sciences,
proceeding lo graduate studies in medicine, law
and business.
Both of these trends suggest to me a need for
change in the character of our undergraduate
education. By far the most important qualities
are those intellectual capabilities which lead to
precision of llioughl and expression and lo the
ability to abstract and conceptualize. We need to
reexamine our basic courses to make certain that
they sharpen these intellectual techniques.
In addition lo Ibis, however, I believe these
trends of switching goals and delaying graduate
education sneak to the need for some courses

that prepare the baccalaureate graduate for
employment upon graduation. Thus, the under
graduate curriculum should have available to it
some general problem-solving courses as well as
courses to provide the students with talent that
could be valuable immediately upon graduation.
Not only would such a curriculum permit the
baccalaureate graduate to experience work activ
ities before going to graduate school, but it
would also have a significant psychological
impact on students who will go immediately to
graduate school.
A student need not feel trapped in the cur
riculum. feeling that his only choice is to
"grind" right on through the graduate school.
Having that option may be quite important to
many students, whether or not they exercise it.
Another curriculum change that should be
considered to meet this particular need is the
so-called "three plus two" plan. This is a five
year curriculum with three years of generalized
undergraduate study and two years of special
ized study that leads to a master's degree. Such a
plan would require more serious attention to the
master's degree than has heretofore been given it
by some of our schools and departments.
Let me turn briefly to our graduate programs,
in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.
In the lew remaining minutes, let me speak on
how Stanford I diversity might respond to the
desire and need for change in its academic pro
grams. It is perhaps worth pointing out that in
the past academic institutions have changed on a
premise of growth. It is lar easier to make
changes iu ;i growth situation, and while we may
experience some slow growth, we will certainly
not experience the rapid growth of tin- last

twenty years. We shall have to seek our changi
by turnover of faculty and more careful plan
ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU
underway to see what are the implications of
longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.
1 should like to point out that we have two
budgetary instruments for innovation and
change. We have recommended in the 1971-72
year budget two funds; one called the University
Progress Fund, and the other called the Research
Development Fund, each in the amount of
$200,000. These are intended to pro\idc I lie
budgetary instruments for initiation of new
teaching and new research programs. When \ on
consider that these amounts must cover much of
the innovative needs of the University, they aic
small amounts, indeed. Nonetheless, the\ do
provide us an opportunity. As soon as the Hoard
of Trustees has made final acceptance of de
budget, which should occur at the April
meeting, 1 shall publish the guidelines for utiliza
tion of these two funds.
Most of our schools are currently engaged in a
degree of intersehool planning, and there ire
programs across the schools which are also in (In
planning stages. In order to bring together tin <
plans and look at them in tin' context of the
entire University, I plan to hold a retreat with
the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com
ment. 1 sense on the part of the faculty an caj'.ei
ncss to return to and put new lite into Mir
academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!
leaders and faculty that there is an indication ot
return to study on the part of both und< i
graduates and graduates. Even if this inelinali' n
is only slight, we must capture the spirit ot 11,I 1, !
movement. If we fail, we will not ha\e been in •
to ourselves or to our students.

Following is the text of an address to the
Academic Council, April 2, 1971, by William F.
Miller, Stanford vice president and provost:
Now is the time lor us to take stock of where
we stand and where we shall go with our aca
demic programs. A number of us have been
engaged in national, regional, and topical studies
of academic needs and academic directions. We
must now look more closely and sharply at what
these studies mean to Stanford. We move from
problems of developing a plan for higher educa
tion, in general, to developing a plan for Stan
ford that will carry us through the next decade.
To be sure, we cannot, nor should we, ignore the
forces at work on higher education nationwide.
But, we must turn to our problems, set our
goals, and develop our implementation of these
goals.
Most institutions of higher education have
been going through an identity crisis in the past
few years, and we are no exception. 1 think we
have suffered less in this regard than many, but
ii is time to find ourselves and choose our
course. In my discussions with faculty, and 1
have extensive discussions in the past few weeks,
1 sense a reaffirmation and a return of interest in
academic goals.
Of the many forces at work on institutions of
higher education, there are some to which Stan
ford should respond, and there are sortie to
which we should not. We have our own history,
we have our own setting, and, no doubt, we shall
find opportunities that will be unique to us.
In speaking of the many forces at work, we
are all acutely aware of the great financial pres
sures on every institution of higher education in
this country. We are aware of public opinion,
both as to how we conduct ourselves and for
what purposes we conduct ourselves.
There are significant changes in the life style
of students, both before and after their gradua
tion. There are new diverse career opportunities
open to graduates that effect their choices of
universities and their paths through these institu
tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the

ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU
underway to see what are the implications of
longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.
1 should like to point out that we have two
budgetary instruments for innovation and
change. We have recommended in the 1971-72
year budget two funds; one called the University
Progress Fund, and the other called the Research
Development Fund, each in the amount of
$200,000. These are intended to pro\idc I lie
budgetary instruments for initiation of new
teaching and new research programs. When \ on
consider that these amounts must cover much of
the innovative needs of the University, they aic
small amounts, indeed. Nonetheless, the\ do
provide us an opportunity. As soon as the Hoard
of Trustees has made final acceptance of de
budget, which should occur at the April
meeting, 1 shall publish the guidelines for utiliza
tion of these two funds.
Most of our schools are currently engaged in a
degree of intersehool planning, and there ire
programs across the schools which are also in (In
planning stages. In order to bring together tin <
plans and look at them in tin' context of the
entire University, I plan to hold a retreat with
the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com

academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!

Following is the text of an address to the
Academic Council, April 2, 1971, by William F.
Miller, Stanford vice president and provost:
Now is the time lor us to take stock of where
we stand and where we shall go with our aca
demic programs. A number of us have been
engaged in national, regional, and topical studies
of academic needs and academic directions. We
must now look more closely and sharply at what
these studies mean to Stanford. We move from
problems of developing a plan for higher educa
tion, in general, to developing a plan for Stan
ford that will carry us through the next decade.
To be sure, we cannot, nor should we, ignore the
forces at work on higher education nationwide.
But, we must turn to our problems, set our
goals, and develop our implementation of these
goals.
Most institutions of higher education have
been going through an identity crisis in the past
few years, and we are no exception. 1 think we
have suffered less in this regard than many, but
ii is time to find ourselves and choose our
course. In my discussions with faculty, and 1
have extensive discussions in the past few weeks,
1 sense a reaffirmation and a return of interest in
academic goals.
Of the many forces at work on institutions of
higher education, there are some to which Stan
ford should respond, and there are sortie to
which we should not. We have our own history,
we have our own setting, and, no doubt, we shall
find opportunities that will be unique to us.
In speaking of the many forces at work, we
are all acutely aware of the great financial pres
sures on every institution of higher education in
this country. We are aware of public opinion,
both as to how we conduct ourselves and for
what purposes we conduct ourselves.
There are significant changes in the life style
of students, both before and after their gradua
tion. There are new diverse career opportunities
open to graduates that effect their choices of
universities and their paths through these institu
tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the
benefit of experience outside of the University.
This phenomenon generates a degree of isola
tion of the faculty from the world around them
and will have an impact on the type of academic
programs that arc possible for a faculty of that
composition. There are increasing pressures for
us to undertake teaching, research, and service
programs only remotely related to our tradi
tional academic goals.
To which of these forces should we respond,
and which may we reasonably ignore?
Even though large private universities, such as
Stanford, are heavily dependent upon public
funds, ve still have some options left as a private
institution. We should exercise these options to
maximize our contribution to higher education,
consistent with goals and ambitions of our
faculty and students.
It is perfectly clear to me that no one person
is going to shape the course of the academic
programs of Stanford University. Any set of

ideas will be altered by critique and refined by
discourse before moving to implementation.
However, 1 should like to share some thoughts
which are foremost in my mind and to introduce
some ideas which I believe need close considera
tion, as well as to indicate some of the mechan
isms by which your ideas as well as mine will be
properly examined and the means by which they
may be realized.
First and foremost, 1 believe that "intellectual
growth" is our raison d'etre. Our societal respon
sibility is to the generation of new knowledge,
articulation of new perceptions, and the devel
opment of new capabilities in people—scholar
ship and teaching. Ours must be a commitment
to the future. We are uniquely prepared to play
this role. There are many immediate concerns
which we cannot fail to heed, but to abandon
our commitment to future generations would
impact us even in our own lifetimes and clearly
within the lifetimes of our current student body.
We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.
Secondly, it is essential, and fortunately still
possible, for us to put a high emphasis on the
quality of education. As I indicated earlier,
choices for a given institution should be made in
the context of its history as well as its vision of
future opportunities. Stanford has developed it
self to a capability for providing a very high
quality of education; to abandon that goal now
would be to abandon a carefully developed
resources at a time when it will be desperately
needed and perhaps rarely available. To be sure,
it is important that we find the means to bring
this high quality education to large numbers of
people who can benefit from the opportunities
of such an education and for whom these oppor
tunities have not been readily available in the
past. 1 speak now of women, timethnic minori
ties, and the economically deprived.
From these general considerations 1 shall turn
to more specific ones that may affect our under
graduate and graduate programs. First, I see two
trends that may impact our undergraduate cur
ricula. 1 believe that we may anticipate an in
creasing movement in post-graduate education
toward attendance in the professional schools,
that is the schools of law, business, medicine and
education. I believe also that we may anticipate
a trend of delaying post-graduate education
acquiring a few years of work experience before
returning lo formal education. Included in this
trend toward the professions will be not only
students from general study curricula, but also
students from engineering and the sciences,
proceeding lo graduate studies in medicine, law
and business.
Both of these trends suggest to me a need for
change in the character of our undergraduate
education. By far the most important qualities
are those intellectual capabilities which lead to
precision of llioughl and expression and lo the
ability to abstract and conceptualize. We need to
reexamine our basic courses to make certain that
they sharpen these intellectual techniques.
In addition lo Ibis, however, I believe these
trends of switching goals and delaying graduate
education sneak to the need for some courses

that prepare the baccalaureate graduate for
employment upon graduation. Thus, the under
graduate curriculum should have available to it
some general problem-solving courses as well as
courses to provide the students with talent that
could be valuable immediately upon graduation.
Not only would such a curriculum permit the
baccalaureate graduate to experience work activ
ities before going to graduate school, but it
would also have a significant psychological
impact on students who will go immediately to
graduate school.
A student need not feel trapped in the cur
riculum. feeling that his only choice is to
"grind" right on through the graduate school.
Having that option may be quite important to
many students, whether or not they exercise it.
Another curriculum change that should be
considered to meet this particular need is the
so-called "three plus two" plan. This is a five
year curriculum with three years of generalized
undergraduate study and two years of special
ized study that leads to a master's degree. Such a
plan would require more serious attention to the
master's degree than has heretofore been given it
by some of our schools and departments.
Let me turn briefly to our graduate programs,
in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.
In the lew remaining minutes, let me speak on
how Stanford I diversity might respond to the
desire and need for change in its academic pro
grams. It is perhaps worth pointing out that in
the past academic institutions have changed on a
premise of growth. It is lar easier to make
changes iu ;i growth situation, and while we may
experience some slow growth, we will certainly
not experience the rapid growth of tin- last

twenty years. We shall have to seek our changi
by turnover of faculty and more careful plan
ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU

longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.

budgetary instruments for innovation and

We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.
Secondly, it is essential, and fortunately still
possible, for us to put a high emphasis on the
quality of education. As I indicated earlier,
choices for a given institution should be made in
the context of its history as well as its vision of
future opportunities. Stanford has developed it
self to a capability for providing a very high
quality of education; to abandon that goal now
would be to abandon a carefully developed
resources at a time when it will be desperately
needed and perhaps rarely available. To be sure,
it is important that we find the means to bring
this high quality education to large numbers of
people who can benefit from the opportunities
of such an education and for whom these oppor
tunities have not been readily available in the
past. 1 speak now of women, timethnic minori
ties, and the economically deprived.
From these general considerations 1 shall turn
to more specific ones that may affect our under
graduate and graduate programs. First, I see two
trends that may impact our undergraduate cur
ricula. 1 believe that we may anticipate an in
creasing movement in post-graduate education
toward attendance in the professional schools,
that is the schools of law, business, medicine and
education. I believe also that we may anticipate
a trend of delaying post-graduate education
acquiring a few years of work experience before
returning lo formal education. Included in this
trend toward the professions will be not only
students from general study curricula, but also
students from engineering and the sciences,
proceeding lo graduate studies in medicine, law
and business.
Both of these trends suggest to me a need for
change in the character of our undergraduate
education. By far the most important qualities
are those intellectual capabilities which lead to
precision of llioughl and expression and lo the
ability to abstract and conceptualize. We need to
reexamine our basic courses to make certain that
they sharpen these intellectual techniques.
In addition lo Ibis, however, I believe these
trends of switching goals and delaying graduate
education sneak to the need for some courses

that prepare the baccalaureate graduate for
employment upon graduation. Thus, the under
graduate curriculum should have available to it
some general problem-solving courses as well as
courses to provide the students with talent that
could be valuable immediately upon graduation.
Not only would such a curriculum permit the
baccalaureate graduate to experience work activ
ities before going to graduate school, but it
would also have a significant psychological
impact on students who will go immediately to
graduate school.
A student need not feel trapped in the cur
riculum. feeling that his only choice is to
"grind" right on through the graduate school.
Having that option may be quite important to
many students, whether or not they exercise it.
Another curriculum change that should be
considered to meet this particular need is the
so-called "three plus two" plan. This is a five
year curriculum with three years of generalized
undergraduate study and two years of special
ized study that leads to a master's degree. Such a
plan would require more serious attention to the
master's degree than has heretofore been given it
by some of our schools and departments.
Let me turn briefly to our graduate programs,
in particular our Ph.D. programs. There are quite
a number of reports which indicate that the
nation will have available fewer job opportuni
ties requiring the Ph.D., both in the immediate
and the long-term future. Most of the studies are
about the immediate future for which one does
not need a study at all to be able to make such
predictions. Whereas there may be a reduced
demand for the Ph.D. graduate, suggesting
decreased enrollment in a number of areas, I do
not anticipate a need for drastic reductions in
our Ph.D. programs.
There will always be a thirst for new know
ledge as well as practical needs for sophisticated
technology and concepts. No doubt we will be
slowed down somewhat, but I believe that Stan
ford will always make significant contributions
through the excellence of our Ph. D.-level pro
grams.
There is one change, however, that we may
anticipate in the Ph.D. program—that is, a trend
toward more applications. We shall see the doc
toral programs broadened to include more stu
dents who intend to utilize their doctoral-level
preparation for practice and application rather
than for advancing a discipline.
I do not sec this as replacing the classical
Ph.D. program, but student and faculty interests
will surely somewhat lead more in this direction.
These programs make no less demand for rigor
or quality.
The change is more concerned with the sub
ject matter of inquiry rather than style. 1 shall
look forward with great eagerness to the results
of the study of graduate education which is
being lead by Professor Merrill Carlsmith.
In the lew remaining minutes, let me speak on
how Stanford I diversity might respond to the
desire and need for change in its academic pro
grams. It is perhaps worth pointing out that in
the past academic institutions have changed on a
premise of growth. It is lar easier to make
changes iu ;i growth situation, and while we may
experience some slow growth, we will certainly
not experience the rapid growth of tin- last

twenty years. We shall have to seek our changi
by turnover of faculty and more careful plan
ning. Because of this slower growth phen
omenon, as well as a current interest in an
integrating-type curricula, 1 expect that inter
departmental and intersehool planning will !><•
more important. We already have a very large,
number of intersehool and interdepartmental
programs.
The departments and disciplines will continue
as a great strength of the University. Uut we can
expect a greater emphasis in associating the
strength of various disciplines with those of
others in order to compose interdepartmental
and intersehool programs both in research and it:
teaching. This type of organizing and planning
will require great care and may require lon«
planning periods and longer searches for faeu!t \
than has been the case in the past. This in
careful and longer period of planning ma\ •
turn call for longer budget cycles. 1 have a stinU
underway to see what are the implications of
longer periods of budget planning than the «in
rent year-by-year cycles.
1 should like to point out that we have two
budgetary instruments for innovation and
change. We have recommended in the 1971-72
year budget two funds; one called the University
Progress Fund, and the other called the Research
Development Fund, each in the amount of
$200,000. These are intended to pro\idc I lie
budgetary instruments for initiation of new
teaching and new research programs. When \ on
consider that these amounts must cover much of
the innovative needs of the University, they aic
small amounts, indeed. Nonetheless, the\ do
provide us an opportunity. As soon as the Hoard
of Trustees has made final acceptance of de
budget, which should occur at the April
meeting, 1 shall publish the guidelines for utiliza
tion of these two funds.
Most of our schools are currently engaged in a
degree of intersehool planning, and there ire
programs across the schools which are also in (In
planning stages. In order to bring together tin <
plans and look at them in tin' context of the
entire University, I plan to hold a retreat with
the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com
ment. 1 sense on the part of the faculty an caj'.ei
ncss to return to and put new lite into Mir
academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!
leaders and faculty that there is an indication ot
return to study on the part of both und< i
graduates and graduates. Even if this inelinali' n
is only slight, we must capture the spirit ot 11,I 1, !
movement. If we fail, we will not ha\e been in •

Following is the text of an address to the
Academic Council, April 2, 1971, by William F.
Miller, Stanford vice president and provost:
Now is the time lor us to take stock of where
we stand and where we shall go with our aca
demic programs. A number of us have been
engaged in national, regional, and topical studies
of academic needs and academic directions. We
must now look more closely and sharply at what
these studies mean to Stanford. We move from
problems of developing a plan for higher educa
tion, in general, to developing a plan for Stan
ford that will carry us through the next decade.
To be sure, we cannot, nor should we, ignore the
forces at work on higher education nationwide.
But, we must turn to our problems, set our
goals, and develop our implementation of these
goals.
Most institutions of higher education have
been going through an identity crisis in the past
few years, and we are no exception. 1 think we
have suffered less in this regard than many, but
ii is time to find ourselves and choose our
course. In my discussions with faculty, and 1
have extensive discussions in the past few weeks,
1 sense a reaffirmation and a return of interest in
academic goals.
Of the many forces at work on institutions of
higher education, there are some to which Stan
ford should respond, and there are sortie to
which we should not. We have our own history,
we have our own setting, and, no doubt, we shall
find opportunities that will be unique to us.
In speaking of the many forces at work, we
are all acutely aware of the great financial pres
sures on every institution of higher education in
this country. We are aware of public opinion,
both as to how we conduct ourselves and for
what purposes we conduct ourselves.
There are significant changes in the life style
of students, both before and after their gradua
tion. There are new diverse career opportunities
open to graduates that effect their choices of
universities and their paths through these institu
tions on the way to these careers.
There will be great pressures for universities
to graduate large numbers of students; and as
usual the pressures for quality will be slight and
shall have to come from within. There is an in
creasingly larger percentage of our faculty who
have settled into academic careers without the
benefit of experience outside of the University.
This phenomenon generates a degree of isola
tion of the faculty from the world around them
and will have an impact on the type of academic
programs that arc possible for a faculty of that
composition. There are increasing pressures for
us to undertake teaching, research, and service
programs only remotely related to our tradi
tional academic goals.
To which of these forces should we respond,
and which may we reasonably ignore?
Even though large private universities, such as
Stanford, are heavily dependent upon public
funds, ve still have some options left as a private
institution. We should exercise these options to
maximize our contribution to higher education,
consistent with goals and ambitions of our
faculty and students.
It is perfectly clear to me that no one person
is going to shape the course of the academic
programs of Stanford University. Any set of

ideas will be altered by critique and refined by
discourse before moving to implementation.
However, 1 should like to share some thoughts
which are foremost in my mind and to introduce
some ideas which I believe need close considera
tion, as well as to indicate some of the mechan
isms by which your ideas as well as mine will be
properly examined and the means by which they
may be realized.
First and foremost, 1 believe that "intellectual
growth" is our raison d'etre. Our societal respon
sibility is to the generation of new knowledge,
articulation of new perceptions, and the devel
opment of new capabilities in people—scholar
ship and teaching. Ours must be a commitment
to the future. We are uniquely prepared to play
this role. There are many immediate concerns
which we cannot fail to heed, but to abandon
our commitment to future generations would
impact us even in our own lifetimes and clearly
within the lifetimes of our current student body.
We may make many changes in both content
and style for our contributions to "intellectual
growth." However, we must always keep our eye
on the main goal and measure any changes
against our overall objective.

the deans of the schools in the early part of the
summer. We shall discuss their plans as well .i
fundamental issues of tin' kind mentioned
above. I have also drafted a call to the faculty to
send directly to me suggestions about the dire*
tion of the academic programs at Stanford. I
want your suggestions on general goals and way
of implementing these goals at Stanford. I shall
give a great deal of attention to such papers, and
will place them before the deans for their con
sideration prior to our retreat.
I should like to close with the following com
ment. 1 sense on the part of the faculty an caj'.ei
ncss to return to and put new lite into Mir
academic programs. I also read in the national
press, and I have heard directly from our slud-'ii!
leaders and faculty that there is an indication ot
return to study on the part of both und< i
graduates and graduates. Even if this inelinali' n
is only slight, we must capture the spirit ot 11,I 1, !
movement. If we fail, we will not ha\e been in •
to ourselves or to our students.
Thank you for the opportunity to li.t\«
opened this conversation. I will look loiuai*' to
your responses.
