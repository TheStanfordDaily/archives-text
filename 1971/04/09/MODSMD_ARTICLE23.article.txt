Viet War Tolls
SAIGON — American battlefield deaths
climbed sharply to 88 last week in the
Indochina war, the highest weekly toll
in the last nine months, the U.S.
Command announced yesterday.
In other developments:
A terrorist bombing wrecked a
downtown Saigon bar crowded with
U.S. soldiers yesterday night, killing
two persons, one an American soldier
and the other a Vietnamese woman.
Twelve American servicemen were
among 16 wounded. Earlier reports had
said 4 0 were wounded.
It was the first such attack directed
against Americans in Saigon since Last
December.
U.S. planes hammared North
Vietnamese forces besieging a South
Vietnamese artillery base in the central
highlands.
Of the 88 Americans killed last week
33 died in the North Vietnamese attack
March 28 on Fire Base Mary Ann 50
miles south of Da Nang.
Tabulations showed that American
battlefield deaths in the first three
months of the year were about 8 0
percent less than in the same period last
year, and 80 percent less than in the
first quarter of 1969.
Withdrawal Plans
WASHINGTON - Two top Senate
leaders, Republican High Scott and
Democrat Robert C. Byrd said
yesterday they believe President Nixon
plans to remove all U.S. troops from
Indochina by the end of his term in
January 1973 provided North Vietnam
frees U.S. war prisoners.
Scott, the Senate GOP Leader, and
Byrd, the Democratic whip, said in
separate news conferences they drew
this interpretation from Nixon's
comments in briefing congressional
leaders before Wednesday night's

announcement of further U.S. troop
withdrawals.
"He did not state a definite date,"
Byrd said, "but I had the very definite
impression from what was said that the
President has a date in mind," asked if
the date was before the end of Nixon's
term, the West Virginia Democrat
replied.
"I think that is substantially correct
as I understood the President."
Scott said the date is flexible
depending on what happens with the
prisoners.
Asked specifically about Scott's
report, White House press secretary
Ronald L. Ziegler said, "I think it
would be incorrect at this time to say
that the President has a specific date
that he feels this plan would be
completed by."
By "plan," Ziegler referred to
Nixon's repeated statements that he has
a plan for end ! ng American
involvement in the war.
Both Scott and Byrd said the date
could come before the presidential
election in November of 1972.
Nixon Criticized
WASHINGTON — Ten congressmen
yesterday called President Nixon's
intervention in the Lt. William Calley
case "extremely improvident."
"Capt. Aubrey Daniel's statement
that he is appalled to see so many
political leaders of the nation who have
failed to see the moral issue in the
Calley case is justified and is to be
applauded," the ten said in a statement.
The ten signing the joint statment
are Reps. Phillip Burton, D-Calif.; John
Conyers, D-Mich.; Bob Eckhardt,
D-Tex.; Don Edwards, D-Calif.; Don
Fraser, D-Minn.; Henry Helstoski,
D-N.J.; Robert Kastenmeier, D-Wis.;
Edward Koch, D-N.Y.; Abner Mikva,
D-lU.; and William F. Ryan, D-N.Y.
