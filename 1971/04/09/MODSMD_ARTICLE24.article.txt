# China Week Panel
## 
### TOM FLEMING 
China Week activities continued
yesterday afternoon featuring a panel
discussion concerning U.S. military,
political and economic involvement in
Taiwan. The session was led by Steve
Thomas and Molly Coye of the
Concerned Asian Students, who based
their information on extensive research
and personal experiences in Taiwan,
(The Republic of China). A discussion
session the night before centered on the
role of women in the Third World
Liberation Movement, and
Asian-American problems.
Yesterday's discussion soon became
an intensive question and answer group
among the small number present.
Interest centered on Taiwan as an
island under martial law since 1949 and
strongly aided by the U.S. In this time,
it was said, Taiwan was made a political
and economic showcase for the U.S.
serving the purposes of military
"containment" of mainland China and

also exploitation by American
corporate enterprises. Also brought out
was the United States' approximately
$50 million annual investment (average
figure since 1965 ) in the 600,000 man
Taiwan army (almost 5 percent of the
population).
At Wednesday's session Carmen
Chow of the Chinese liberation
organization, I Wor Kuen, explained
the evolution of the revolutionary
movement among the Chinese and her
role in that movement "There is a
misconception that the Chinese people
are middle-class, conservative,
bought-off, and apathetic," stated
Chow. "There is a high degree of
consciousness among them, however.
They want a realistic strategy for
victory, not rhetoric," she said.
Further activities under the auspices
of China Week include a film and talk
in Cubberly on Monday at 7 :30 p.m.
by Ann Tompkins, a teacher in Peking
from 1965-69.
