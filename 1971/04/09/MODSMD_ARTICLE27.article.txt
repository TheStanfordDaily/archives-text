Campus Gun Law
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council's (SCLC) final ratification of
legislation prohibiting the possession
and use of dangerous weapons on the
Stanford Campus is anticipated at the
next SCLC meeting on April 15.
Chris Hocker, one of five students on
the 11 member student-faculty council,
attributed the delay of the proposal's
third and formal approval at last
Monday's meeting to incidental
rewording needs and foresees no serious
opposition to the measure's passage.
The proposed legislation would
encompass all Stanford University lands
and facilities, owned or leased and
located in the United States or abroad.
Except for authorized academic
purposes, it prohibits any Stanford
student from possessing firearms,
explosives, brass knuckles or any
weapon or instrument such as a
blackjack, slingshot, billy, sandclub or
sandbag.
Resident Stanford students who wish
to store weapons will have to comply
with the state and federal regulations
and leave all arms with the Stanford
Police Department.
Removal of all weapons from storage
would be subject to regulations
established by the Stanford Police
Department or Director of the foreign
campus. Weapons would be stored
within six hours after a students arrival
on campus and must be off campus
within one hour after removal from
storage.
If the legislation receives a minimum
of seven affirmative votes it becomes
effective 10 days after its mandatory
publication in the Daily.
The SCLC would not have the power
to determine sentencing of violators.
The following legislation on social
regulations has been given second
passage by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC). According

to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968 (article 1.D.1 .e.), this
legislation will become effective 10
days after its publication.
All university regulations heretofore
cognizable by the Stanford Judicial Council
governing sign-out procedures, visiting hours,
and dress on the Stanford home campus are
abolished.
Limitations:
(1) Notwithstanding the above, residence
in individual units will be limited to these
students who have contracted for them.
(2) Individual residence units may, by
majority vote of all members taken by secret
ballot, establish limits on visiting hours and
other social regulations for their residences.
Violation of such regulations is an offense
cognizable by the Stanford Judicial Council,
provided that the regulations have first been
submitted to and approved by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council.
(3) This legislation does not alter the scope
of the Fundamental Standard
SST Loss Cited
An aerospace industry spokesman said
here yesterday he fears a "dangerously
simplistic" emotional reaction to
technological advance is behind the
defeat of the supersonic transport
project.
Dr. Karl G. Harr Jr., president of the
Aerospace Industries Association of
America, said in a talk at the Graduate
School of Business that the anti-SST
effort was a symptom of a broader
anti-science, anti-technology mood.
"I have never heard seriously
advanced agruments as grossly over
simplified and irrational as some of
those by the opponents of the SST,"
said Harr, who lobbied for the project
in Washington.
"I am seriously concerned that we
are really attacking the rational pursuit
of knowledge itself," he said. "When
we lose our willingness to push forward
and experiment on the frontiers of
knowledge, we also will have lost faith
in our ability to manage the
implications of our discoveries."

students who have contracted for them.
(2) Individual residence units may, by
majority vote of all members taken by secret
ballot, establish limits on visiting hours and
other social regulations for their residences.
Violation of such regulations is an offense
cognizable by the Stanford Judicial Council,

submitted to and approved by the Student
Conduct Legislative Council.

SST Loss Cited
An aerospace industry spokesman said
here yesterday he fears a "dangerously
simplistic" emotional reaction to
technological advance is behind the
defeat of the supersonic transport
project.
Dr. Karl G. Harr Jr., president of the
Aerospace Industries Association of
America, said in a talk at the Graduate
School of Business that the anti-SST
effort was a symptom of a broader
anti-science, anti-technology mood.
"I have never heard seriously
advanced agruments as grossly over
simplified and irrational as some of
those by the opponents of the SST,"
said Harr, who lobbied for the project
in Washington.
"I am seriously concerned that we
are really attacking the rational pursuit
of knowledge itself," he said. "When
we lose our willingness to push forward
and experiment on the frontiers of
knowledge, we also will have lost faith
in our ability to manage the
implications of our discoveries."
Campus Gun Law
The Student Conduct Legislative
Council's (SCLC) final ratification of
legislation prohibiting the possession
and use of dangerous weapons on the
Stanford Campus is anticipated at the
next SCLC meeting on April 15.
Chris Hocker, one of five students on
the 11 member student-faculty council,
attributed the delay of the proposal's
third and formal approval at last
Monday's meeting to incidental
rewording needs and foresees no serious
opposition to the measure's passage.
The proposed legislation would
encompass all Stanford University lands
and facilities, owned or leased and
located in the United States or abroad.
Except for authorized academic
purposes, it prohibits any Stanford
student from possessing firearms,
explosives, brass knuckles or any
weapon or instrument such as a
blackjack, slingshot, billy, sandclub or
sandbag.
Resident Stanford students who wish
to store weapons will have to comply
with the state and federal regulations
and leave all arms with the Stanford
Police Department.
Removal of all weapons from storage
would be subject to regulations
established by the Stanford Police
Department or Director of the foreign
campus. Weapons would be stored
within six hours after a students arrival
on campus and must be off campus
within one hour after removal from
storage.
If the legislation receives a minimum
of seven affirmative votes it becomes
effective 10 days after its mandatory
publication in the Daily.
The SCLC would not have the power
to determine sentencing of violators.
The following legislation on social
regulations has been given second
passage by the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC). According

to the Legislative and Judicial Charter
of 1968 (article 1.D.1 .e.), this
legislation will become effective 10
days after its publication.
All university regulations heretofore
cognizable by the Stanford Judicial Council
governing sign-out procedures, visiting hours,
and dress on the Stanford home campus are
abolished.
Limitations:
(1) Notwithstanding the above, residence
in individual units will be limited to these
students who have contracted for them.
(2) Individual residence units may, by
majority vote of all members taken by secret
ballot, establish limits on visiting hours and
other social regulations for their residences.
Violation of such regulations is an offense
cognizable by the Stanford Judicial Council,
provided that the regulations have first been

Conduct Legislative Council.
