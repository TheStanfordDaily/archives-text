# Six Arrests At Packard Speech
## 
### FRED MANN 
At least six persons were arrested
outside the Hilton Hotel in San
Francisco last night, protesting the
appearance of former Stanford trustee
and current Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard.
A crowd of around 150
demonstrators, most of them from
Stanford and the Palo Alto area massed
on Mason St., across from the hotel
while Packard delivered a speech to the
Western Electronics Manufacturers
Association (WEMA) inside, under

strict security. The speech had been
originally scheduled for Rickey's Hyatt
House in Palo Alto, but was chan«*M to
the San Francisco site by WEMA
officials claiming Rickey's was too
small for the expected turnout.
Local anti-war groups had publicized
their intent to place Packard under
people's arrest for alledged war crimes.
But last night, Packard and the
protesters never saw each other.
While more than 600 representatives
of western electronics firms (including
Lockheed, SRI, and Hewlett-Packard)
listened to the high-ranking official call

for increased amounts of research and
development by companies in this area,
protesters outside chanted slogans, held
a mock communion on the sidewalk,
and—after having been declared an illegal
assembly—ran from pursuing police.
Witnesses told of numerous
motorcycle police chasing
demonstrators up sidewalks of steep
city hills in an effort to tire and catch
the protesters. No injuries were
reported.
Security around the Hilton was
massive, with plainclothes federal
officers manning every entrance.
Packard made reference to the
demonstration outside in his address
entitled "The Department of Defense
in a Time of Peace." He said he was
sorry to see the WEMA get "chased out
of Palo Alto," and later added that
around the world there has been "no
reduction in subversion, terrorism, and
violence—just look at Palo Alto."
According to KZSU reporter Pete
Williams, Packard went on to say that
he had left "peaceful Palo Alto" over
two years ago, and his return was "a
little disappointing."
He called the anti-war protesters
outside, "the Pete McClosky campaign
committee," and told listeners that
people like Jane Fonda and David
Harris (both recent speakers here) are
"your greatest enemies."
Most of his speech was devoted to
supporting the Nixon doctrine in
regards to the Middle East. "The
United States must have arms ready at
all times" in that part of the world, he
said. The only time he drew applause
during the course of his address was
when he stated he considered the North
Vietnamese to be the aggressors in
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
Packard himself barred all electronic
media from the Imperial room where he
delivered his speech, and he devoted
part of his presentation to an attack on
CBS-TV. Earlier in the day, a Senate
committee suspoened the network to
submit all film, tapes, and notes
concerning the recently aired controversial
special "The Selling of the Pentagon,"
to the federal government.

and current Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard.
A crowd of around 150
demonstrators, most of them from
Stanford and the Palo Alto area massed
on Mason St., across from the hotel
while Packard delivered a speech to the
Western Electronics Manufacturers
Association (WEMA) inside, under

strict security. The speech had been
originally scheduled for Rickey's Hyatt
House in Palo Alto, but was chan«*M to
the San Francisco site by WEMA
officials claiming Rickey's was too
small for the expected turnout.
Local anti-war groups had publicized
their intent to place Packard under
people's arrest for alledged war crimes.
But last night, Packard and the
protesters never saw each other.
While more than 600 representatives
of western electronics firms (including
Lockheed, SRI, and Hewlett-Packard)
listened to the high-ranking official call

for increased amounts of research and
development by companies in this area,
protesters outside chanted slogans, held
a mock communion on the sidewalk,
and—after having been declared an illegal
assembly—ran from pursuing police.
Witnesses told of numerous
motorcycle police chasing
demonstrators up sidewalks of steep
city hills in an effort to tire and catch
the protesters. No injuries were
reported.
Security around the Hilton was
massive, with plainclothes federal
officers manning every entrance.
Packard made reference to the
demonstration outside in his address
entitled "The Department of Defense
in a Time of Peace." He said he was
sorry to see the WEMA get "chased out
of Palo Alto," and later added that
around the world there has been "no
reduction in subversion, terrorism, and
violence—just look at Palo Alto."
According to KZSU reporter Pete
Williams, Packard went on to say that
he had left "peaceful Palo Alto" over
two years ago, and his return was "a
little disappointing."
He called the anti-war protesters
outside, "the Pete McClosky campaign
committee," and told listeners that
people like Jane Fonda and David
Harris (both recent speakers here) are
"your greatest enemies."
Most of his speech was devoted to
supporting the Nixon doctrine in
regards to the Middle East. "The
United States must have arms ready at
all times" in that part of the world, he
said. The only time he drew applause
during the course of his address was
when he stated he considered the North
Vietnamese to be the aggressors in
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia.
Packard himself barred all electronic
media from the Imperial room where he
delivered his speech, and he devoted
part of his presentation to an attack on
CBS-TV. Earlier in the day, a Senate
committee suspoened the network to
submit all film, tapes, and notes
concerning the recently aired controversial
special "The Selling of the Pentagon,"
to the federal government.
At least six persons were arrested
outside the Hilton Hotel in San
Francisco last night, protesting the
appearance of former Stanford trustee
and current Deputy Secretary of
Defense David Packard.
