# Fire Damages UCSC
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
A fast moving fire swept through the
administration building of the
University of California at Santa Cruz
early yesterday morning, gutting two
thirds of the building, and doing an
estimated $250,000 to $3 00,000 in
damage.
Firemen at the scene suspected
arson.
"The building was engulfed so fast
we feel it had to be set," commented
Fire Capt. David Alsip. Campus Fire
Marshall Frank Borges later claimed
however, that investigators would have
to examine the burnt out portions of
the building in order to determine the
exact cause of the blaze, seen as far
away as Monterey, some twenty miles
across the bay.
The fire was reported at 1:48 a.m.
by a James Easter, a campus policeman.
Fire Capt. Edward Smith, one of the
first on the scene, said that when he
arrived, "Flames 30 to 4 0 feet high
were rolling out of the balcony over the
rooftop at least half the length of the
building."
Firemen said the blaze apparently
started on the second floor near the
office of Chancellor Dean Mcllenry,
which was completely destroyed.
Alsip commented that the flames
"shot right up the middle of the

building" until "more than half the
roof caved in."
Borges commented that the worst
damage was on the second floor of the
two-story concrete building, while
there was extensive smoke and water
damage on the ground floor.
It took some fifty firemen two hours
to control the blaze which Fire Chief
Ted McEwen called the largest loss
from fire in Santa Cruz history. No
injuries were reported.
Many records in the $750,000
structure were destroyed, but Borges
said that the most important records
had been sealed in fire resistant files or
duplicated elsewhere.
Employees in the building were given
the day off and temporary offices were
set up which, one spokesman said,
might cause a slight delay in the
admissions process.
Although the FBI was initially asked
to investigate the case, Special Agent
Richard Gebhardt later said in San
Francisco that the FBI had not entered
the case.
Santa Cruz, with an enrollment of
3,2 00 and some 75 miles south of San
Francisco is a cluster of five colleges
with a sixth set to open in September
and a seventh in 1 972.
There has been a notable lack at
Santa Cruz of the violence that has
occured on other college campuses.
