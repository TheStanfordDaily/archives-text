# Land Use
## Policy Hurts Housing 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
News Analysis
Several months have passed since the
Livingston/Blayney land use policy
plan was presented to the Board of
Trustees. A lot of discussion has gone
on in the Palo Alto/Menlo Park
community about the possible
implications of the report, yet safe
within the walls of Stanford, little has
been said or done. In a public meeting
held last week in Dinkelspiel
participation was so sparse (less than
100 people) that many of those present
felt that they had come on the wrong
night.
The Livingston report, which can be
found at all local libraries, is a nicely
bound, well illustrated plan which
would promote the addition of a new
industrial park on Sand Hill road across
from SLAC. If you will go out and look
at this unspoiled rolling-hill area and
then try to picture how it will look
with bulldozers pushing away the land,
and monsterish buildings and roads
filling up the green fields, you might
become somewhat dismayed at the
prospect of "progress."
If a lovely new industrial park
doesn't bother you, then perhaps you
should consider the fact that such an
industrial development will require a
new freeway, euphemistically entitled
the Willow Expressway. This
engineering wonder will zoom through
the foothills ( 8 lanes and 1 00,000 cars
per day) and plans to extend through
Menlo Park (carefully skirting their
industrial Park) and then it crashs
through 220 units of low-cost housing
in East Menlo Park.
According to Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development Romney, the
national housing shortage for families
of low or moderate income is estimated
at more than 2 million units. In Santa
Clara County, a recent study indicates
that 34,000 renter households earning
less than $5 700 per year must compete
for only 1 4 ,000 units available at prices
they can reasonably afford (24 percent
of monthly income).
The Moulton Committee Report
released in 1969 devoted some
attention to Stanford's share in causing
this housing crisis. "The University," it
declared, "has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing
both because of the housing needs of
its student, faculty and staff, and
because its land development
programs . . . have significantly
increased demand for local housing."
The report estimated the current
unsatisfied demand for low-income
units alone (i.e., exclusive of
moderate-income units) in the Palo
Alto-Stanford area at about 4 000 and
judged that about 70 percent of this
shortage was directly attributable to

university operations or the
development of Stanford lands.
Since that time, Stanford has done
very little to relieve the housing
pressure. Manzanita Park and Escondito
IV have housed an additional 800
students, yet it must be noted that this
provides only limited relief due to the
fact that several students normally
occopy one off-campus unit.
Furthermore, the development of the
Dillingham project and Coyote Hill will
more than likely wipe out these gains.
Livingston's "flexable" policy/plan
provides for a housing minimum of 98 4
units with a maximum of 2,660. A
more realistic estimate of what will
actually happen would be somewhere
slightly above the minimum. Even the
maximum figure is inadequate when
you consider the 4 ,000 unit need.
Another question is the advisability
of placing an industrial park across
from SLAC. According to Prof. D.M.
Mason, Chairman of the Land and
Building Development Committee, the
Sand Hill property "might be better
used for expansion of SLAC" and
therefore should be placed in
"academic reserve." "You can't predict
the future of SLAC" or its future need
for expansion.
Even so, the Livingston report gives
this land parcel high priority for
industrial park use. In fact the entire
report pushes land development which
will give high priority to high income
producing development (industrial).

Livingston catches himself in a circle
when he states that his highest
consideration was for the academic
"eminence" of the university. He then
links academic eminence with finances
and the result seems to be a report that
calls for high profits and industrial
development.
Hopefully the trustees will reverse
this priority. The report is flexable
enough so that development could be
kept at a minimum and the University's
tax burden could be reduced through
the use of the Williamson Act, which
would preserve land is open space at
the lowest possible tax rate.
Hopefully the Stanford Community
will become involved for the decision
on land use will directly affect them. If
action is delayed until the bulldozers
arrive, as happened last Spring when a
parking lot was placed next to the Delt
House. The community will be forced
to witness the destruction of the
foothills, and the additional pollution
of a new freeway.
An industrial park does not have to
be placed on Stanford lands. It would
probably do the most good in the Black
community east of Bayshore, where it
could serve as a new and convenient
source of jobs and would most
certainly provide a needed boost in the
tax base.
The next public meeting will be held
April 19, at 7:30 p.m. in the Forum
Room of the Meyer Library.

CIVILIZATION HOâ€”These rolling hills and trees along Sand Mill Road may soon
be leveled by the axe of progress if the proposed industrial park is approved by
the trustees.
