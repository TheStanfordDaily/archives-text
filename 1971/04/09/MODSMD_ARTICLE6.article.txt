# Events of the Week
## Revolution Popularization 
### 
David Harris came to Church
this past weekend. Put down
Stanford, Bruce Franklin,
Vietnam, and a few other odds
and ends as I understand it. Also,
made the cover of last week's
Rolling Stone, coming down on,
as he phrased it, the "Space
Cadets," that is, the current
Youth Culture bag-hustle trip
behind organic foods. "All the
Good Vibes in the world ain't
gonna help you when the Man
comes down."
Bruce Franklin now has visiting
hours at Stanford, between 1-5
p.m. every weekday, ostensibly to
collect evidence for his upcoming
"trial"—the most important of his
life, if only because his job is at
stake and the radical right has
made him their very own
whipping boy. With over 1000
"John Doe" subpoenas out, is it
any wonder that the radicals,
Right and Left, have grown silent
of late?
Doug McHenry made the news,
that is, the Stanford Daily, being
the focal point of one Dan
Bernstein so-called "news
analysis." Accused of reverse
racism, of patronism (strange to
hear a black in America accused
of Patronage when we have been
recipients of the same for so
long!). Doug McHenry, not too
coincidentally, running for

student body president of the
Farm.
The Black Student Union at
Stanford marching on this
University's Hospital behind the
firing of a black worker. That
same place where so many Nobel
Laureates draw their
semi-monthly checks, fat ones at
that. No one disputing their right
to earn a living, concerned rather
over a young, outspoken black
man's right to earn a living. Not so
campus-oriented as Black Studies,
but pregnant with more
possibilities of growth.
Lt. William Calley is convicted
of murdering 127 peasants in the
course of following out "o ders"
and all of a sudden America
wishes there hadn't been a
Nuremberg precedent. A
Newsweek poll reveals 4 out of 5
"Americans" opposed to the
conviction. Paul Harvey reports of
a retired colonel in Texas who
offered to serve time with Calley,
saying that he, while in Vietnam,
planted explosives on a waterpipe
that resulted in the deaths by
drowning of some 1200
Vietnamese peasants and this he,
the colonel, did in the course of
fighting a "war."
War has no morals, we are told.
All are subject to death, civilian
and soldier, bystander and the

involved, the innocent and the
guilty. They all go the same way,
they all face the same possibilities.
Charles Manson and his Hippie
Band of Gypsies is finally
convicted of Murder One, and we
are told that it will be three-four
years before they get the chair. In
the meantime, Sirhan Sirhan
languishes on Death Row,
forgotten, James Earl Ray lies in
prison somewhere, forgotten.
ZODIAC is still on the loose,
writing letters nowadays to the
Los Angeles Times rather than our
own San Francisco Chronicle.
Some of us, for sure, breathe
strange sighs of relief.
The news comes through that
drug addiction is rising- not in the
ghetto, where it has already risen
and become a Presence—but in the
white community. Lot of people
unaware of how this galls the
ghetto-dweller, like the fact that
there are some 100,000 registered
drug addicts with half of them
living in Harlem alone. Or the
newspaper • headlines about
six-year-olds dead from overdoses
in that community, surely not a
registered hype! All this good
marijuana floating through the
campus much less the community
simply obfuscating any concern
with those kind of happenings.
And white America wonders if
the Peace Corps is still relevant!
Was checking out the Grammy
Awards. Saw where Simon &
Garfunkel got over with their
"Bridge Over Troubled Water."
Aretha Franklin sang it like they
never knew it could be sung, but
that didn't matter. Saw where The
Carpenters, out of Long Beach
State College, got the Grammy for
"Best Group" and you didn't even
hear The Jackson s's name
mentioned. People around here
and other places still thinking you
got to be high or on drugs or
something not to appreciate
what's going on.
Went to see "Love Story." All
about the "Generational Gap."
Lots of my friends from the West
Side of the Freeway (the other
side of the tracks) telling me
beforehand that it could be good

Johnie Scott

for a couple of tears, that it was,
in fact, a real tear-jerker. Saw it
last Sunday, at a matinee, at the
Varsity, in fact, with about nine
other people (in the whole
place!).
Saw a couple of old ladies
sniffle. Was surprised myself at
the amount of profanity
(obscenity?) in the flick. Wasn't
really taken in by the
emotionalism of the whole thing.
Made a mental note to myself that
Harvard wasn't like that, and that
it hadn't changed THAT MUCH
since I was there myself, going
through them changes. Made its
point, however—that America will
dish out the coin for a good solid
middle-class cinema no matter the
subject so long as you mix in a
appropriate amount of corn and
bring the audience "closer" to
reliving their own childhood love.
Maybe the most positive things
to happen in the past week or so
has been my meeting Nathan
Malbrue, an ex-con fresh out of
San Quentin with a novel five
years in the writing who reads in
those pages like a modern-day
Richard Wright and finding out
that WEST SOUNDS down in
"Whiskey Gulch" is a good set no
matter if you got money or not.
Nathan concerned with how to
get his work published without
being ripped off—by the left-wing
Press as well as the Establishment
(I said, "Welcome to the Club,
Nate!"). Joe & Eddie over at
WEST SOUNDS doing the thing
they know best how to do—give
you, the customer, a fair shake
and a good deal, not being too
bohemian, not playing too much
of a straight line. Aware all the
time that politics determines one's
success, one's lifespan.
The only question now is just
how "for real" the Stanford Daily
and other campus papers will be
in presenting a forum. They can
vamp any time, out of petulance,
really. Somebody reads it, though.
Got a news clipping over spring
break from a Columbia grad, Class
of '21, who read my article on
David and Bruce in the Fresno
Bee. In "Campus Viewpoint."
