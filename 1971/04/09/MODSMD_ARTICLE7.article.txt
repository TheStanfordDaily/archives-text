To: Hospital Employees
From: The Black Advisory Committee, Stanford
Hospital
Subject: OUR STAND ON THE SAM BRIDGES
CASE
We, the Members of the Black Advisory
Committee, upon reading the charges made by Mr.
Sam Bridges, did, in fact, conduct a thorough
investivation regarding his dismissal. The
investigation disclosed the following facts.
1) On several occasions his co-workers
complained that Mr. Bridges was not doing his
work and that they had to carry his workload as
well as their own.
2) On two particular occasions he verbally
abused—l) a co-worker because he was questioned
about some work he had not done, and 2) a
Security Guard because he was told that he had to
put money in a parking meter.

3) He was found asleep on one occasion in the
"Brown Bag" room while he was supposed to be
working.
4) He was counselled about his work
performance on at least three different occasions
due to complaints by his co-workers.
5) He was observed on campus several times
while he was supposed to be working.
The Black Advisory Committee can present
evidence to substantiate these facts. It was our
conclusion that Mr. Bridges was terminated
because he was not doing the job he was hired to
do, and therefore putting an added burden on his
co-workers.
Had Mr. Bridges, after being told about the
grievance procedure, chosen to take his case before
the grievance committee, this Committee would
have insured him fair and impartial treatment.
