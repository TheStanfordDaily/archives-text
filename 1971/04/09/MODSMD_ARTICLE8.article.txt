# Pegged Bureaucracy
## High Noon With The Food Service 
### 
Since my art history class
usually runs until 12:20 p.m., and
American literature starts at 1:15,
I foresaw distinct problems in
getting to lunch. The dorm food
services close at 12:30 and reopen
at 1:00. It seemed a choice of
either dashing from art to Stern
(logistically, if not
gastronomically, the soundest
selection) or waiting for late
lunch, at which time I'd stuff
myself obscenely for ten minutes,
wiping my hands (and probably
face and elbows) as I panted into
lit, caked mashed potatoes and
droplets of Mazola oil still clinging
to my clothes. Neither plan
seemed aesthetically pleasing, nor
especially intriguing to my
stomach, which resists dorm food
even under optimum conditions.
I resolved to pose my dilemma
to the University Food Service.
I bicycled furiously past
Hoover Tower, Encina, and

Trailers, Campus Drive, the police
and fire station, and Escondido
Village. Oh, onward weary
traveller! I pushed further and
further West, recapturing the
spirit of manifest destiny. At last
my straining eyes gleaned a glass
and stucco structure on the
horizon.
Rhythm of Keys
As I entered, four women with
busy typewriters glanced up, and
then down again. The rhythm of
keys striking paper never faltered.
Many moments later a pert little
lady acknowledged me with:
"May I help you?"
"Yes, I was thinking of getting
a meal plan without lunches."
"Without lunches?"
"Yes." (There was a brief
pause.)
"Are you living in a University
residence hall?"

"I'm over in Lagunita."
"Then you can't get a meal
plan without lunches."
"I can't?"
"No." (a second pause)
"Why not?"
"If you live in a University
residence, you have to buy
lunches."
"But I won't be able to eat
them; I have classes at noon."
"You have a class conflict?"
"Yes." (again a pause)
"There are no refunds for less
than five consecutive days."
"Fine, I have noon classes five
days per week."
"Then you wouldn't want any
lunches during the week?"
"No, no lunches." (A long
pause at this point; obviously the
situation qualified as a serious
one.)
Best Bet Bagged
"Let me see your schedule; all
class conflicts are verified with the
Registrar. . . But where's your
conflict?"
"I have an 11:00 to 12:20, and
then a 1:15."
"Then you have 10 minutes for
lunch. Or your best bet might be
to get a bagged lunch from your
dorm."
"The best bet for soggy
sandwiches and wilter carrots."
"Well, I'm sorry, but you will
have to pay for lunches."
"There's no way out?"
"No."
The matter was closed and I
had no recourse. Like some small
wriggling insect impaled on a pin,
I'd been pegged through the
abdomen by a giant bureaucracy.
Leaving, my stomach churned not
in anticipation of the 10 weeks of
sumptuous lunches I'd just
purchased, but in fierce
indignation.

DAILY staffer.)
