# Lyman,Women Correspond Over Campus Recruiting
## 
### 
Dear President Lyman,
On February 26, members of
our group demonstrated in front
of the Placement Center to
protest the presence of Food
Machinery Corporation recruiters
on the campus. It was a symbolic
act only, since we did not attempt
to prevent interviews from being
held.
Having tried to make a point by
demonstrating, we continue our
effort by making a direct appeal
to you. We ask you to prohibit all
interviews on campus by military
recruiters and companies which
are involved in the production of
weapons. We realize that such a
ban would have to be carefully
formulated, since many
companies manufacture items that
can be used equally well by
civilian and military consumers.
Such items do not include
armored vehicles, flamethrowers,
and grenades which explode into
hundreds of flesh-tearing darts.
There are at least three
arguments against such a ban:
1. Freedom of speech. The
campus should be a place where
anyone can express his point of
view, however unpopular that
view happens to be.
Our response is that
recruitment is not speech. It is the
first, and perhaps most important,
step in the process of production.
Without high calibre employees,
such as Stanford can provide, a
company cannot function
efficiently. Neither can the armed
services.
2. Freedom of choice. Students
should be able to choose courses
of action for themselves, among
legal alternatives, even if some of
those alternatives are repugnant to
certain members of the
community.
Our response is that Stanford
cannot insulate itself from certain
moral imperatives. Employers
who discriminate on the basis of
race are not permitted to
interview here. Even if such
discrimination were legal we
believe it would not be permitted
at Stanford. Our athletic teams
cannot play against Brigham
Young University, nor can
members of the community watch
contests between the two schools,
even though they might wish to.
Producing anti-personnel bombs
in support of our present foreign

policy is as immoral as practicing
racial discrimination, and legal
only in the narrowest sense.
3. While the Vietnam war is
wrong, providing for the defense
of the United States is necessary;
therefore producing weapons and
maintaining an army are not, in
themselves, evil. To demand that
Stanford ban recruitment by war
manufacturers and the military is
to ask the University to publicly
favor unilateral disarmament.
Our response is that while the
undersigned are not all pacifists,
we are appalled at the
uncontrolled growth of the
military establishment in this
country. Since World War II the
U.S. has spent more than one
trillion dollars on the military
budget and Secretary Laird
proposes to increase it once again.
You have spoken eloquently
against the war in Indochina and
we are sure you share the
profound helplessness we feel in
the face of an administration that
feels bound neither by the
Constitution, the laws of
Congress, nor the will of 73
percent of the American people.
At this moment our
government is steadily laying
waste a once beautiful portion of
the earth and destroying its
people, with an inferno of
firepower. If we are ever to
become free of the irrational
forces responsible for this tragedy
we must do what we can,
wherever we can, to reduce the
power, the prestige, and the
influence of the military
establishment.
At Stanford we can make the
job of supplying the war machine
more difficult by slowing down
military recruitment and the
production of weapons. If the
armed services and war
manufacturers were forced to
hold their interviews off campus,
the news would spread and other
Un iversities mi gh t fo 11 o w
Stanford's example. The message
here would be clear — to students,
to the government, and to the
community — that agencies of war
are no longer welcome on the
campus. In view of the
continuing, daily, slaughter in
Indochina an end to Stanford's
association with the war would
not be a political act but a moral
one. All we ask is that the

University say "no" to what is
anti-human and to shut its doors
to those whose buaness is killing.

LYMAN RESPONSE
The question of which
organizations should be allowed
to use the facilities of the
Placement Center is not a new one
to Stanford. It last arose as a
major issue in 1967-68 involving
primarily CIA recruiting. During
that period I made several
statements describing my views on
the subject.
One in particular, on December
3, 1969, seems to me still to the
point: "... it is University policy
to allow all employers equal
access to campus job recruiting
facilities. Such facilities exist as a
service to students; needless to say
no student need avail himself of
this service unless he wishes, and
any student is free both to choose
what placement interviewers he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his views as to the
policies and actions of any
employer using Stanford's
facilities."
I continue to view the activities
of the Placement Center in this
way. Given the existence of this
service — and that is not at issue —
I can see no acceptable or
workable standards for judging
which corporation or government
agency is honorable enough to
allow our students to have access
to it nor do I think it would be
proper for the University to apply
such standards. The University
policy which denies access to

concerns which discriminate on
the basis of race or sex is not to
the point here. It does not rest on
any judgment by the University of
the value, wisdom or morality of a
company's activities; instead, it
rests on the premise that to use
the University's facilities a
company must be genuinely open
to all Stanford students. Thus, the
University has not established
itself as a law enforcement agency
or as arbiter of the moral worth of
others; it is insisting that its
students, for whom the service is
provided, be treated fairly,
regardless of race or sex.
Two facts about the operation
of the Placement Center underline
this point. First, we do not invite
employers; we make space
available if a company wishes to
interview Stanford students and if
students wish to be interviewed. If
no students sign up, the company
is advised not to send its recruiter.
Second, unlike some university
placement services we will not
pre-screen students who want
interviews. A company must agree
to see any student who wants to
be seen. Thus, the system is
entirely open and voluntary on
both sides.
The feelings which prompted
your petition and the brief
demonstration at the Placement
Center on February 26 are visible
all around us. Indeed, it seems
that each day's newspapers bring
fresh evidence of the extent and
depth of feeling against the war
and of the readiness of many
people to act against it in ways

that they would not previously
have considered proper. In these
circumstances it is even more
important to keep in mind the
conditions that will be required to
rebuild our people's spirit when
this dreadful was is over. One of
them, to openness, to tolerance,
to those practices and habits of
mind that make critical inquiry
possible. To accede to the request
of the Stanford Community
Women for Peace would be to
move in the wrong direction.
I commend the care and
thought which produced the
petition, and I especially
appreciate its tone of reasonable
discourse. I regret that I cannot
accept its conclusions.

LYMAN RESPONSE
The question of which
organizations should be allowed
to use the facilities of the
Placement Center is not a new one
to Stanford. It last arose as a
major issue in 1967-68 involving
primarily CIA recruiting. During
that period I made several
statements describing my views on
the subject.
One in particular, on December
3, 1969, seems to me still to the
point: "... it is University policy
to allow all employers equal
access to campus job recruiting
facilities. Such facilities exist as a
service to students; needless to say
no student need avail himself of
this service unless he wishes, and
any student is free both to choose
what placement interviewers he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his views as to the
policies and actions of any
employer using Stanford's
facilities."
I continue to view the activities
of the Placement Center in this
way. Given the existence of this
service — and that is not at issue —
I can see no acceptable or
workable standards for judging
which corporation or government
agency is honorable enough to
allow our students to have access
to it nor do I think it would be
proper for the University to apply
such standards. The University
policy which denies access to

concerns which discriminate on
the basis of race or sex is not to
the point here. It does not rest on
any judgment by the University of
the value, wisdom or morality of a
company's activities; instead, it
rests on the premise that to use
the University's facilities a
company must be genuinely open
to all Stanford students. Thus, the
University has not established
itself as a law enforcement agency
or as arbiter of the moral worth of
others; it is insisting that its
students, for whom the service is
provided, be treated fairly,
regardless of race or sex.
Two facts about the operation
of the Placement Center underline
this point. First, we do not invite
employers; we make space
available if a company wishes to
interview Stanford students and if
students wish to be interviewed. If
no students sign up, the company
is advised not to send its recruiter.
Second, unlike some university
placement services we will not
pre-screen students who want
interviews. A company must agree
to see any student who wants to
be seen. Thus, the system is
entirely open and voluntary on
both sides.
The feelings which prompted
your petition and the brief
demonstration at the Placement
Center on February 26 are visible
all around us. Indeed, it seems
that each day's newspapers bring
fresh evidence of the extent and
depth of feeling against the war
and of the readiness of many
people to act against it in ways

that they would not previously
have considered proper. In these
circumstances it is even more
important to keep in mind the
conditions that will be required to
rebuild our people's spirit when
this dreadful was is over. One of
them, to openness, to tolerance,
to those practices and habits of
mind that make critical inquiry
possible. To accede to the request
of the Stanford Community
Women for Peace would be to
move in the wrong direction.
I commend the care and
thought which produced the
petition, and I especially
appreciate its tone of reasonable
discourse. I regret that I cannot
accept its conclusions.

VIGIL AUNTIE- Stanford police keep watch on American
matronhood picketing FMC one month ago. Women For Peace
maintained a silent vigil at the Placement Center against military
recruiting Wednesday and yesterday.
Dear President Lyman,
On February 26, members of
our group demonstrated in front
of the Placement Center to
protest the presence of Food
Machinery Corporation recruiters
on the campus. It was a symbolic
act only, since we did not attempt
to prevent interviews from being
held.
Having tried to make a point by
demonstrating, we continue our
effort by making a direct appeal
to you. We ask you to prohibit all
interviews on campus by military
recruiters and companies which
are involved in the production of
weapons. We realize that such a
ban would have to be carefully
formulated, since many
companies manufacture items that
can be used equally well by
civilian and military consumers.
Such items do not include
armored vehicles, flamethrowers,
and grenades which explode into
hundreds of flesh-tearing darts.
There are at least three
arguments against such a ban:
1. Freedom of speech. The
campus should be a place where
anyone can express his point of
view, however unpopular that
view happens to be.
Our response is that
recruitment is not speech. It is the
first, and perhaps most important,
step in the process of production.
Without high calibre employees,
such as Stanford can provide, a
company cannot function
efficiently. Neither can the armed
services.
2. Freedom of choice. Students
should be able to choose courses
of action for themselves, among
legal alternatives, even if some of
those alternatives are repugnant to
certain members of the
community.
Our response is that Stanford
cannot insulate itself from certain
moral imperatives. Employers
who discriminate on the basis of
race are not permitted to
interview here. Even if such
discrimination were legal we
believe it would not be permitted
at Stanford. Our athletic teams
cannot play against Brigham
Young University, nor can
members of the community watch
contests between the two schools,
even though they might wish to.
Producing anti-personnel bombs
in support of our present foreign

policy is as immoral as practicing
racial discrimination, and legal
only in the narrowest sense.
3. While the Vietnam war is
wrong, providing for the defense
of the United States is necessary;
therefore producing weapons and
maintaining an army are not, in
themselves, evil. To demand that
Stanford ban recruitment by war
manufacturers and the military is
to ask the University to publicly
favor unilateral disarmament.
Our response is that while the
undersigned are not all pacifists,
we are appalled at the
uncontrolled growth of the
military establishment in this
country. Since World War II the
U.S. has spent more than one
trillion dollars on the military
budget and Secretary Laird
proposes to increase it once again.
You have spoken eloquently
against the war in Indochina and
we are sure you share the
profound helplessness we feel in
the face of an administration that
feels bound neither by the
Constitution, the laws of
Congress, nor the will of 73
percent of the American people.
At this moment our
government is steadily laying
waste a once beautiful portion of
the earth and destroying its
people, with an inferno of
firepower. If we are ever to
become free of the irrational
forces responsible for this tragedy
we must do what we can,
wherever we can, to reduce the
power, the prestige, and the
influence of the military
establishment.
At Stanford we can make the
job of supplying the war machine
more difficult by slowing down
military recruitment and the
production of weapons. If the
armed services and war
manufacturers were forced to
hold their interviews off campus,
the news would spread and other

way. Given the existence of this
service — and that is not at issue —
I can see no acceptable or
workable standards for judging
which corporation or government
agency is honorable enough to
allow our students to have access
to it nor do I think it would be
proper for the University to apply
such standards. The University
policy which denies access to

concerns which discriminate on
the basis of race or sex is not to
the point here. It does not rest on
any judgment by the University of
the value, wisdom or morality of a
company's activities; instead, it
rests on the premise that to use
the University's facilities a
company must be genuinely open
to all Stanford students. Thus, the
University has not established
itself as a law enforcement agency
or as arbiter of the moral worth of
others; it is insisting that its
students, for whom the service is
provided, be treated fairly,
regardless of race or sex.
Two facts about the operation
of the Placement Center underline
this point. First, we do not invite
employers; we make space
available if a company wishes to
interview Stanford students and if
students wish to be interviewed. If
no students sign up, the company
is advised not to send its recruiter.
Second, unlike some university
placement services we will not
pre-screen students who want
interviews. A company must agree
to see any student who wants to
be seen. Thus, the system is
entirely open and voluntary on
both sides.
The feelings which prompted
your petition and the brief
demonstration at the Placement
Center on February 26 are visible
all around us. Indeed, it seems
that each day's newspapers bring
fresh evidence of the extent and
depth of feeling against the war
and of the readiness of many
people to act against it in ways

that they would not previously
have considered proper. In these
circumstances it is even more
important to keep in mind the
conditions that will be required to
rebuild our people's spirit when
this dreadful was is over. One of
them, to openness, to tolerance,
to those practices and habits of
mind that make critical inquiry
possible. To accede to the request
of the Stanford Community
Women for Peace would be to
move in the wrong direction.
I commend the care and
thought which produced the
petition, and I especially
appreciate its tone of reasonable
discourse. I regret that I cannot
accept its conclusions.

VIGIL AUNTIE- Stanford police keep watch on American
matronhood picketing FMC one month ago. Women For Peace
maintained a silent vigil at the Placement Center against military
recruiting Wednesday and yesterday.
Dear President Lyman,
On February 26, members of
our group demonstrated in front
of the Placement Center to
protest the presence of Food
Machinery Corporation recruiters
on the campus. It was a symbolic
act only, since we did not attempt
to prevent interviews from being
held.
Having tried to make a point by
demonstrating, we continue our
effort by making a direct appeal
to you. We ask you to prohibit all
interviews on campus by military
recruiters and companies which
are involved in the production of
weapons. We realize that such a
ban would have to be carefully
formulated, since many
companies manufacture items that
can be used equally well by
civilian and military consumers.
Such items do not include
armored vehicles, flamethrowers,
and grenades which explode into
hundreds of flesh-tearing darts.
There are at least three
arguments against such a ban:
1. Freedom of speech. The
campus should be a place where
anyone can express his point of
view, however unpopular that
view happens to be.
Our response is that
recruitment is not speech. It is the
first, and perhaps most important,
step in the process of production.
Without high calibre employees,
such as Stanford can provide, a
company cannot function
efficiently. Neither can the armed
services.
2. Freedom of choice. Students
should be able to choose courses
of action for themselves, among
legal alternatives, even if some of
those alternatives are repugnant to
certain members of the
community.
Our response is that Stanford
cannot insulate itself from certain
moral imperatives. Employers
who discriminate on the basis of
race are not permitted to
interview here. Even if such
discrimination were legal we
believe it would not be permitted
at Stanford. Our athletic teams
cannot play against Brigham
Young University, nor can
members of the community watch
contests between the two schools,
even though they might wish to.
Producing anti-personnel bombs
in support of our present foreign

policy is as immoral as practicing
racial discrimination, and legal
only in the narrowest sense.
3. While the Vietnam war is
wrong, providing for the defense
of the United States is necessary;
therefore producing weapons and
maintaining an army are not, in
themselves, evil. To demand that
Stanford ban recruitment by war
manufacturers and the military is
to ask the University to publicly
favor unilateral disarmament.
Our response is that while the
undersigned are not all pacifists,
we are appalled at the
uncontrolled growth of the
military establishment in this
country. Since World War II the
U.S. has spent more than one
trillion dollars on the military
budget and Secretary Laird
proposes to increase it once again.
You have spoken eloquently
against the war in Indochina and
we are sure you share the
profound helplessness we feel in
the face of an administration that
feels bound neither by the
Constitution, the laws of
Congress, nor the will of 73
percent of the American people.
At this moment our
government is steadily laying
waste a once beautiful portion of
the earth and destroying its
people, with an inferno of
firepower. If we are ever to
become free of the irrational
forces responsible for this tragedy
we must do what we can,
wherever we can, to reduce the
power, the prestige, and the
influence of the military
establishment.
At Stanford we can make the
job of supplying the war machine
more difficult by slowing down
military recruitment and the
production of weapons. If the
armed services and war
manufacturers were forced to
hold their interviews off campus,
the news would spread and other
Un iversities mi gh t fo 11 o w
Stanford's example. The message
here would be clear — to students,
to the government, and to the
community — that agencies of war
are no longer welcome on the
campus. In view of the
continuing, daily, slaughter in
Indochina an end to Stanford's
association with the war would
not be a political act but a moral
one. All we ask is that the

University say "no" to what is
anti-human and to shut its doors
to those whose buaness is killing.

LYMAN RESPONSE
The question of which
organizations should be allowed
to use the facilities of the
Placement Center is not a new one
to Stanford. It last arose as a
major issue in 1967-68 involving
primarily CIA recruiting. During
that period I made several
statements describing my views on
the subject.
One in particular, on December
3, 1969, seems to me still to the
point: "... it is University policy
to allow all employers equal
access to campus job recruiting
facilities. Such facilities exist as a
service to students; needless to say
no student need avail himself of
this service unless he wishes, and
any student is free both to choose
what placement interviewers he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his views as to the
policies and actions of any
employer using Stanford's
facilities."
I continue to view the activities
of the Placement Center in this
way. Given the existence of this
service — and that is not at issue —

There are at least three
arguments against such a ban:
1. Freedom of speech. The
campus should be a place where
anyone can express his point of
view, however unpopular that
view happens to be.
Our response is that
recruitment is not speech. It is the
first, and perhaps most important,
step in the process of production.
Without high calibre employees,
such as Stanford can provide, a
company cannot function
efficiently. Neither can the armed
services.
2. Freedom of choice. Students
should be able to choose courses
of action for themselves, among
legal alternatives, even if some of
those alternatives are repugnant to
certain members of the
community.
Our response is that Stanford
cannot insulate itself from certain
moral imperatives. Employers
who discriminate on the basis of
race are not permitted to
interview here. Even if such
discrimination were legal we
believe it would not be permitted
at Stanford. Our athletic teams
cannot play against Brigham
Young University, nor can
members of the community watch
contests between the two schools,
even though they might wish to.
Producing anti-personnel bombs
in support of our present foreign

policy is as immoral as practicing
racial discrimination, and legal
only in the narrowest sense.
3. While the Vietnam war is
wrong, providing for the defense
of the United States is necessary;
therefore producing weapons and
maintaining an army are not, in
themselves, evil. To demand that
Stanford ban recruitment by war
manufacturers and the military is
to ask the University to publicly
favor unilateral disarmament.
Our response is that while the
undersigned are not all pacifists,
we are appalled at the
uncontrolled growth of the
military establishment in this
country. Since World War II the
U.S. has spent more than one
trillion dollars on the military
budget and Secretary Laird
proposes to increase it once again.
You have spoken eloquently
against the war in Indochina and
we are sure you share the
profound helplessness we feel in
the face of an administration that
feels bound neither by the
Constitution, the laws of
Congress, nor the will of 73
percent of the American people.
At this moment our
government is steadily laying
waste a once beautiful portion of
the earth and destroying its
people, with an inferno of
firepower. If we are ever to
become free of the irrational
forces responsible for this tragedy
we must do what we can,
wherever we can, to reduce the
power, the prestige, and the
influence of the military
establishment.
At Stanford we can make the
job of supplying the war machine
more difficult by slowing down
military recruitment and the
production of weapons. If the
armed services and war
manufacturers were forced to
hold their interviews off campus,
the news would spread and other
Un iversities mi gh t fo 11 o w
Stanford's example. The message
here would be clear — to students,
to the government, and to the
community — that agencies of war
are no longer welcome on the
campus. In view of the
continuing, daily, slaughter in
Indochina an end to Stanford's
association with the war would
not be a political act but a moral
one. All we ask is that the

University say "no" to what is
anti-human and to shut its doors
to those whose buaness is killing.

LYMAN RESPONSE
The question of which
organizations should be allowed
to use the facilities of the
Placement Center is not a new one
to Stanford. It last arose as a
major issue in 1967-68 involving
primarily CIA recruiting. During
that period I made several
statements describing my views on
the subject.
One in particular, on December
3, 1969, seems to me still to the
point: "... it is University policy
to allow all employers equal
access to campus job recruiting
facilities. Such facilities exist as a
service to students; needless to say
no student need avail himself of
this service unless he wishes, and
any student is free both to choose
what placement interviewers he
wishes to see and to express
publicly his views as to the
policies and actions of any
employer using Stanford's
facilities."
I continue to view the activities
of the Placement Center in this
way. Given the existence of this
service — and that is not at issue —
I can see no acceptable or
workable standards for judging
which corporation or government
agency is honorable enough to
allow our students to have access
to it nor do I think it would be
proper for the University to apply
such standards. The University
policy which denies access to

concerns which discriminate on
the basis of race or sex is not to
the point here. It does not rest on
any judgment by the University of
the value, wisdom or morality of a
company's activities; instead, it
rests on the premise that to use
the University's facilities a
company must be genuinely open
to all Stanford students. Thus, the
University has not established
itself as a law enforcement agency
or as arbiter of the moral worth of
others; it is insisting that its
students, for whom the service is
provided, be treated fairly,
regardless of race or sex.
Two facts about the operation
of the Placement Center underline
this point. First, we do not invite
employers; we make space
available if a company wishes to
interview Stanford students and if
students wish to be interviewed. If
no students sign up, the company
is advised not to send its recruiter.
Second, unlike some university
placement services we will not
pre-screen students who want
interviews. A company must agree
to see any student who wants to
be seen. Thus, the system is
entirely open and voluntary on
both sides.
The feelings which prompted
your petition and the brief
demonstration at the Placement
Center on February 26 are visible
all around us. Indeed, it seems
that each day's newspapers bring
fresh evidence of the extent and
depth of feeling against the war
and of the readiness of many
people to act against it in ways

that they would not previously
have considered proper. In these
circumstances it is even more
important to keep in mind the
conditions that will be required to
rebuild our people's spirit when
this dreadful was is over. One of
them, to openness, to tolerance,
to those practices and habits of
mind that make critical inquiry
possible. To accede to the request
of the Stanford Community
Women for Peace would be to
move in the wrong direction.
I commend the care and
thought which produced the
petition, and I especially
appreciate its tone of reasonable
discourse. I regret that I cannot
accept its conclusions.

VIGIL AUNTIE- Stanford police keep watch on American
matronhood picketing FMC one month ago. Women For Peace
maintained a silent vigil at the Placement Center against military
recruiting Wednesday and yesterday.
Dear President Lyman,
On February 26, members of
our group demonstrated in front
of the Placement Center to
protest the presence of Food
Machinery Corporation recruiters
on the campus. It was a symbolic
act only, since we did not attempt
to prevent interviews from being
held.
Having tried to make a point by
demonstrating, we continue our
effort by making a direct appeal
to you. We ask you to prohibit all
interviews on campus by military
recruiters and companies which
are involved in the production of
weapons. We realize that such a
ban would have to be carefully
formulated, since many
companies manufacture items that
can be used equally well by
civilian and military consumers.
Such items do not include
armored vehicles, flamethrowers,
and grenades which explode into
hundreds of flesh-tearing darts.
There are at least three
arguments against such a ban:
1. Freedom of speech. The
campus should be a place where
anyone can express his point of
view, however unpopular that
view happens to be.
Our response is that
recruitment is not speech. It is the
first, and perhaps most important,
