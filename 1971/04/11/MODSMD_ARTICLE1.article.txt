Twenty-three persons, including the chairman of the
Black Students' Union (BSU) and a candidate for the
Palo Alto City Council, were arrested on a variety of
charges that include assault with a deadly weapon,
conspiracy, assault on a police officer, all felonies;

police officer, failure to disperse and refusal to leave a
public building after being ordered to do so
(misdemeanors).
About two do/en demonstrators, not all of whom
were arrested, and 13 police officers were reported
injured. Most of the demonstrators suffered head and
hand injuries after being clubbed by the police, while
most of the police and sheriff's deputies were injured by
ll\ ing glass, ashtrays, staplers, telephone books, table
legs and other 'missies.
I he administrative offices where the demonstrators
barricaded themselves were in shambles. Broken electric
typewriters were strewn across floors; broken glass and
water was under foot everywhere; furniture was
damaged beyond recognition. Deputy hospital director
I rank Vitale estimated damage at about $100,000.
A larms Set
Campus police reported 11 false fire alarms, five
bomb threats including two at the hospital and two
trash fires following the arrests. Three fire bombs were
thrown at a PG&E substation near the Women's Gym
early Saturday morning, but no damage was reported.
Palo Alto Police Chief James Zurcher said that 65
Palo Alto police were deployed. They were
supplemented by 110 sheriff's deputies under a mutual
aid agreement.
All of the adults arrested were released on bail or
bond late Saturday night. The three minors arrested will
remain in custody until Monday.
The adults will be arraigned at 10 a.m., April 21 at
the North County Courthouse.
The near-riot by far the most violent situation on
campus since last spring crrupted over the firing of a
black hospital custodian, Sam Bridges. [Sec
accompanying story.] The demonstrators barricaded
themselves in the offices of hospital director Dr. Thomas
(ionda in an attempt to obtain Bridges' reinstatement.
The Black United Front (BliF), a coalition that
includes the BSU, began the tense sit-in Thursday
afternoon after an apparent misunderstanding with
Goi.da about the form his response to its
demands including the immediate reinstatement of
Bridges was to take, (ionda later agreed to comply with
all BUI demands except the reinstatement of Bridges.
Barricades Established
However, the BUF-administration negotiations broke
down and shortly before 5 p.m. Friday, 60 of the
demonstrators decided to remain in Gonda's office.
Hearing that at least one busload of police was on the
way. they began to build barricades at both ends of the
corridor I lie demonstrators used desks, chairs, filing

cabinets, tabic tops and other picecs of furniture to
effectively barricade both sets of reinforced plate glass
doors.
At about 5:45 p.m., police units moved in, blocking
off exits at both ends of the corridor. Vi,a 1 c demanded
that the group immediately vacate the premises, saying
that it was interfering with the orderly functioning of
the hospital. Assistant Palo Alto Police Chief Anderson
repeated the order to leave the premises, and gave the
group five minutes to do so without facing arrest.
At 5:59 p.m., Anderson called in to BSU chairman
Willie Newberry: "Then you're not going to leave?"
The reply shouted back at Anderson was a loud
"Right on!"
Battering Ram
Police then produced a six-foot battering ram, which
they apparently obtained from the hospital's
maintenance plant, and unsuccessfully began to attack
one of the reinforced glass doors.
After several efforts, one pane of glass was smashed.
Police attempted to spray a Mace-like substance at the
demonstrators, but the protestors used a fire hose to
repel I both the charging police and their irritant. One
policeman was hit by a flying stapler, and he collapsed in
a pool of water.
The effects of the blown-back irritant then were felt
by police, reporters, faculty observers and onlookers,
and the situation remained static for about 10 minutes
The crowd, which was being held back by a double line
of riot-equipped policemen, continued to shout
encouragement to those sitting in and obscenities at the
police.
Onlookers Declared Illegal
"II takes a lot ol nerve to hold those clubs against
unarmed people," one woman yelled
"Power to the people," the crowd chanted
Ihe onlookeis and most of the press were then
declared an unlawful assembly by Anderson, and the
officers began to push tlieni back in earnest They

stopped after the crowd had been moved back some 30
yards and contained behind a pair of locked glass doors.
A hospital employee among the demonstrators produced
a key, and unlocked the doors. An angry sergeant
relocked them amidst a barrage of angry curses.
Police then repeatedly assaulted the barricaded doors,
but were repelled three times by the use of the tire hose
and assorted missies, including telephones.
In desperation, police loosened one door with what
appeared to be a crowbar and a pair of bolt-cutters, and,
at 6:30 p.m., using a rope, succeeded in pulling the
twisted door out of the way.
'Let's Get 'Em'
As the door was pulled back with a rope, a police
officer hollered "l et's get 'em," and the police eagerly
vaulted over the barricade. At the same time,
demonstrators opened a door at the other end of the
corridor, where only ten policemen were stationed.
Ihe officers were temporalily overwhelmed by the
escaping protestors, and several policemen were beaten
to the ground by demonstrators armed with clubs. One
officer suffered an apparent broken shoulder as a result
of a beating.
Other demonstrators left the offices through the
windows several of which were smashed and shimmied
to the ground on another fire hose. No one who escaped
by this method was arrested.
At least one who was injured during the melee was
later arrested as she was obtaining medical assistance at
the Palo Al o Clinic.
One photographer on the scene estimated that it took
police no more than 30 seconds to secure the entire
occupied corridor. Several ol the demonstrators were

a key, and unlocked the doors. An angry sergeant
relocked them amidst a barrage of angry curses.
Police then repeatedly assaulted the barricaded doors,
but were repelled three times by the use of the tire hose
and assorted missies, including telephones.
In desperation, police loosened one door with what
appeared to be a crowbar and a pair of bolt-cutters, and,
at 6:30 p.m., using a rope, succeeded in pulling the
twisted door out of the way.
'Let's Get 'Em'
As the door was pulled back with a rope, a police
officer hollered "l et's get 'em," and the police eagerly
vaulted over the barricade. At the same time,
demonstrators opened a door at the other end of the
corridor, where only ten policemen were stationed.
Ihe officers were temporalily overwhelmed by the
escaping protestors, and several policemen were beaten
to the ground by demonstrators armed with clubs. One
officer suffered an apparent broken shoulder as a result
of a beating.
Other demonstrators left the offices through the

to the ground on another fire hose. No one who escaped
by this method was arrested.
At least one who was injured during the melee was

maintenance plant, and unsuccessfully began to attack
one of the reinforced glass doors.
After several efforts, one pane of glass was smashed.
Police attempted to spray a Mace-like substance at the
demonstrators, but the protestors used a fire hose to
repel I both the charging police and their irritant. One
policeman was hit by a flying stapler, and he collapsed in
a pool of water.
The effects of the blown-back irritant then were felt
by police, reporters, faculty observers and onlookers,

off exits at both ends of the corridor. Vi,a 1 c demanded
that the group immediately vacate the premises, saying
that it was interfering with the orderly functioning of
the hospital. Assistant Palo Alto Police Chief Anderson
repeated the order to leave the premises, and gave the
group five minutes to do so without facing arrest.
At 5:59 p.m., Anderson called in to BSU chairman
Willie Newberry: "Then you're not going to leave?"
The reply shouted back at Anderson was a loud
"Right on!"
Battering Ram
Police then produced a six-foot battering ram, which
they apparently obtained from the hospital's
maintenance plant, and unsuccessfully began to attack
one of the reinforced glass doors.
After several efforts, one pane of glass was smashed.
Police attempted to spray a Mace-like substance at the
demonstrators, but the protestors used a fire hose to
repel I both the charging police and their irritant. One
policeman was hit by a flying stapler, and he collapsed in
a pool of water.
The effects of the blown-back irritant then were felt
by police, reporters, faculty observers and onlookers,
and the situation remained static for about 10 minutes
The crowd, which was being held back by a double line
of riot-equipped policemen, continued to shout
encouragement to those sitting in and obscenities at the
police.
Onlookers Declared Illegal
"II takes a lot ol nerve to hold those clubs against
unarmed people," one woman yelled
"Power to the people," the crowd chanted
Ihe onlookeis and most of the press were then
declared an unlawful assembly by Anderson, and the
officers began to push tlieni back in earnest They

stopped after the crowd had been moved back some 30
yards and contained behind a pair of locked glass doors.
A hospital employee among the demonstrators produced
a key, and unlocked the doors. An angry sergeant
relocked them amidst a barrage of angry curses.
Police then repeatedly assaulted the barricaded doors,
but were repelled three times by the use of the tire hose
and assorted missies, including telephones.
In desperation, police loosened one door with what
appeared to be a crowbar and a pair of bolt-cutters, and,
at 6:30 p.m., using a rope, succeeded in pulling the
twisted door out of the way.
'Let's Get 'Em'
As the door was pulled back with a rope, a police
officer hollered "l et's get 'em," and the police eagerly
vaulted over the barricade. At the same time,
demonstrators opened a door at the other end of the
corridor, where only ten policemen were stationed.
Ihe officers were temporalily overwhelmed by the
escaping protestors, and several policemen were beaten
to the ground by demonstrators armed with clubs. One
officer suffered an apparent broken shoulder as a result
of a beating.
Other demonstrators left the offices through the
windows several of which were smashed and shimmied
to the ground on another fire hose. No one who escaped
by this method was arrested.
At least one who was injured during the melee was
later arrested as she was obtaining medical assistance at
the Palo Al o Clinic.
One photographer on the scene estimated that it took
police no more than 30 seconds to secure the entire
occupied corridor. Several ol the demonstrators were
