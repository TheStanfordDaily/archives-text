Wo, the members of the Black Advisory Committee,
are appalled at the violence perpetuated by these police
on a non-violent assembly. We are also appalled at the
idea that the Acting President of the University would
find it necessary to order police into a patient area,
especially after the hospital Director stated that there
would be no police action upon the occupants of the
administrative suite.
We are holding a closed meeting for black employees
at 9:30 a.m. Monday morning in room MlO4 in the
Medical School, then adjourn and go to a mass rally at
10:30 a.m. Monday morning at the Medical School lawn
off Campus Drive.
lilack Advisory (Committer
The Alianza Latina supports 100 percent the final
finding of the Black Advisory Committee. i'hat. is, that
Sam Bridges was unjustly terminated and that he be
reinstated with pay retroactive to day of discharge.
However this issue has now been transcenoed by the
vicious and totally unwarrented police action on a
peaceful assembly of employees and friends.
This assault on black, brown, and white individuals
has tragically pinpointed Stanford University's attitude
toward minority employees. Provost Miller's decision to
use University tactics (refusing to negotiate and resorting
to police violence) on employees is a striking (no pun
intended) example of his arrogance.
This violation of the workers' basic right to
peacefully protest an unjust administrative act should be
the concern of all workers.
There will be a meeting of all Latin employees
Monday morning at 9:30 a ra in room MlO6.
