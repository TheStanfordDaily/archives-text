# Reason Lost In Pace Of Events
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER DAN BERNSTEIN News Analysis 
A sit-in, which, ironically, was not originally planned
as a sit-in, developed Friday into one of the bloodier
riots in Stanford history.
Throughout the 30-hour occupation of
Administrative Offices at the Medical Center, and the
intensive negotiating sessions that accompanied it, a few
facts stand out.
—There was a crucial period early Friday afternoon
which a combination of skillful negotiating and good
timing might have resulted in a peaceful conclusion to
the occupation.
—Once this chance had been forfeited by a
combination of hasty decisions and intransigence on
both sides, the only alternative remaining was a bloody
confrontation.
The occupation began almost by accident, as some 50
people left a noon rally for fired worker Sam Bridges
and for Jose Aguilar, a professor who had not been
granted tenure, and went to what they understood was a
scheduled 1:00 p.m. meeting with Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Associate Dean of the Medical Center.
Finding Gonda absent, the group decided to sit down
in the foyer of his offices and wait for his return. Hours
later, when Medical Center officials finally contacted
Gonda, the demonstrators were still waiting before his
offices. Gonda then met with members of the Black
United Front -(BUF), which was leading the group, and
told them at that time that Bridges would not be rehired
immediately.
The demonstrators then decided to stay until Bridges
was rehired.
Groups represented in the continuing negotiations
were the BUF, the Black Advisory Committee (BAC),
and the hospital administration. At issue were the seven
BUF demands, which dealt with the rights of employees
to criticize the hospital administration, to form unions,
to have grievance rights and to have peers present at
those grievance procedures. Other demands were for the
BAC and the Alanzia Latina, a Chicano workers' rights
group, to have the right to investigate claims of violation
of the above rights, and that fired janitor Bridges be
rehired.
Five of these demands were readily agreed upon, as
the administration declared that these rights already
existed. This left the demand for the rehiring of Bridges
as the one point of contention.
A key factor in Friday morning's discussions was the
reversal by the BAC of the previous stand they had
taken supporting Bridges' firing.

During these negotiations, many members of the BAC
said that they would resign their jobs if Bridges were not
rehired.
Upon the completion of the negotiations,
misunderstandings started to develop on all sides.
Administration officials left the session with the
understanding that the occupation would not stop until
Bridges was rehired. Apparently basing his decision on
that assumption, and after consultation with Gonda,
Wilson, Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig, and
others, Acting President William Miller sent a statement
to the sit-in, saying that "there will be no conclusion on
the composition of dates for the grievance procedure
while the occupation of the hospital continues."
What Miller and other Administration officials were
unaware of was the developing willingness of the BUF to
leave the- occupation if the grievance procedures for
Bridges were started immediately.
In fact, the BUF, in a meeting with
the BAC and some black hospital workers, after the last
session with administration officials, had agreed to leave
if the grievance procedures for Bridges were started
immediately, compromising on their demand for
immediate rehiring.
Events, however, were going Loo fast to be reversed,
or even slowed by now. * Immediately after
the BUF-BAC caucus had agreed on this point, according
to Cheatam, the message came from Miller, which, in
effect, slapped the demonstrators in the face right after
they had made a concession. And, at the same time as
Miller's statement arrived, word came from surveillance
forces for the demonstrators that police were massing,
and preparing to come to the hospital and stop the
occupation.
Once the demonstrators had ascertained this, there
was no backing down. Although they had agreed with
the BAC to change their stand on Bridges' rehiring, they
had had no time to make a statement to this effect and
to leave with their goals apparently achieved. To leave
without making a statement, after hearing of the massing
of police, would amount to backing down under
fire—something they would not do. Instead, they erected
barricades to defend themselves, and asked all who did
not want to remain inside to leave.
At the same time, having called the police, and having
no knowledge of the turn of events in the negotiations,
Administration officials could not recall the police. The
stage for the confrontation was set, and the outcome
inevitable.
Administration officials defend the timing of the
police action stating that they wanted to proceed while
it was still light, after the adjacent clinics had been
closed, and before visiting hours began, so that corridor
traffic would be at a minimum.
Between the confusion of demands, negotiations,
pressures and counter-pressures, at least one crucial
element of compromise was lost in the shuffle. The BUF
was willing to compromise, but the Administration did
not know it when it took its irrevocable step and called
police.

or even slowed by now. * Immediately after
the BUF-BAC caucus had agreed on this point, according
to Cheatam, the message came from Miller, which, in
effect, slapped the demonstrators in the face right after
they had made a concession. And, at the same time as
Miller's statement arrived, word came from surveillance
forces for the demonstrators that police were massing,
and preparing to come to the hospital and stop the
occupation.
Once the demonstrators had ascertained this, there
was no backing down. Although they had agreed with
the BAC to change their stand on Bridges' rehiring, they
had had no time to make a statement to this effect and
to leave with their goals apparently achieved. To leave
without making a statement, after hearing of the massing
of police, would amount to backing down under
fire—something they would not do. Instead, they erected
barricades to defend themselves, and asked all who did
not want to remain inside to leave.
At the same time, having called the police, and having
no knowledge of the turn of events in the negotiations,
Administration officials could not recall the police. The
stage for the confrontation was set, and the outcome
inevitable.
Administration officials defend the timing of the
police action stating that they wanted to proceed while
it was still light, after the adjacent clinics had been
closed, and before visiting hours began, so that corridor
traffic would be at a minimum.
Between the confusion of demands, negotiations,
pressures and counter-pressures, at least one crucial
element of compromise was lost in the shuffle. The BUF
was willing to compromise, but the Administration did
not know it when it took its irrevocable step and called
police.
A sit-in, which, ironically, was not originally planned
as a sit-in, developed Friday into one of the bloodier
riots in Stanford history.
Throughout the 30-hour occupation of
Administrative Offices at the Medical Center, and the
intensive negotiating sessions that accompanied it, a few
facts stand out.
—There was a crucial period early Friday afternoon
which a combination of skillful negotiating and good
timing might have resulted in a peaceful conclusion to
the occupation.
—Once this chance had been forfeited by a
combination of hasty decisions and intransigence on
both sides, the only alternative remaining was a bloody
confrontation.
The occupation began almost by accident, as some 50
people left a noon rally for fired worker Sam Bridges
and for Jose Aguilar, a professor who had not been
granted tenure, and went to what they understood was a
scheduled 1:00 p.m. meeting with Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Associate Dean of the Medical Center.
Finding Gonda absent, the group decided to sit down
in the foyer of his offices and wait for his return. Hours
later, when Medical Center officials finally contacted
Gonda, the demonstrators were still waiting before his
offices. Gonda then met with members of the Black
United Front -(BUF), which was leading the group, and
told them at that time that Bridges would not be rehired
immediately.
The demonstrators then decided to stay until Bridges
was rehired.
Groups represented in the continuing negotiations
were the BUF, the Black Advisory Committee (BAC),
and the hospital administration. At issue were the seven
BUF demands, which dealt with the rights of employees
to criticize the hospital administration, to form unions,
to have grievance rights and to have peers present at
those grievance procedures. Other demands were for the
BAC and the Alanzia Latina, a Chicano workers' rights
group, to have the right to investigate claims of violation
of the above rights, and that fired janitor Bridges be
rehired.
Five of these demands were readily agreed upon, as
the administration declared that these rights already
existed. This left the demand for the rehiring of Bridges
as the one point of contention.
A key factor in Friday morning's discussions was the
reversal by the BAC of the previous stand they had
taken supporting Bridges' firing.

During these negotiations, many members of the BAC
said that they would resign their jobs if Bridges were not
rehired.
Upon the completion of the negotiations,
misunderstandings started to develop on all sides.
Administration officials left the session with the
understanding that the occupation would not stop until
Bridges was rehired. Apparently basing his decision on
that assumption, and after consultation with Gonda,
Wilson, Associate Provost Robert Rosenzweig, and
others, Acting President William Miller sent a statement
to the sit-in, saying that "there will be no conclusion on
the composition of dates for the grievance procedure
while the occupation of the hospital continues."
What Miller and other Administration officials were
unaware of was the developing willingness of the BUF to
leave the- occupation if the grievance procedures for
Bridges were started immediately.
In fact, the BUF, in a meeting with
the BAC and some black hospital workers, after the last
session with administration officials, had agreed to leave
if the grievance procedures for Bridges were started
immediately, compromising on their demand for
immediate rehiring.
