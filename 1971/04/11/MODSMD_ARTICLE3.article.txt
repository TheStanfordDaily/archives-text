# Brown Arrested
## 
### FRED MANN 
Professor Robert McAfee Brown, his son Peter, and
Associate Dean of Students Bill Leland were arrested
along with 14 others Friday for blocking the entrance to
Berkeley's main draft board offices.
All 17 were charged with blocking a public walkway,
a misdemeanor, and were released immediately. A
hearing has been set for April 19.
It was the fourth time the elder Brown, a professor of
religion, had blocked draft board doorways in the last
six weeks, but it was his first arrest. On three previous
occasions, he and other clergy, faculty, and
students including his son and Leland closed the
entrance to the San Mateo draft center for the entire
working day. Each time, the board refused to file a
complaint, and San Mateo police ignored the protestors.
This time however the location was different, and the
demonstrators predominantly students. Police action
was swift. After blocking the entrance for only half an
hour, the group was arrested and marched to the police
station, only a block away.
"I choose to preach my Good Friday sermon not in a
church, but on a pavement, not with words but with a
deed," said the 56-year old minister. "I am proud to be
here."
