Closing and occupying an area of a hospital is not an
acceptable way to pursue a grievance or make a point.
When that tactic is used, as it was for more than 30

involved to leave voluntarily, 1 was prepared to refrain
from asking for police assistance. However, disruption of
hospital functions could not be allowed to continue for
long, and when it became clear this afternoon that
further discussion would not be productive, I asked the
Palo Alto Police for assistance.
1 regret, as much as anyone, that this disturbance had
to be tolerated even for as long as it was. I hope it will
be recognized, however, that what was at issue here was
not simply expensive research equipment or valuable
records, but sick people. Our first obligation was to
protect their interests and each decision to act or not to
act was taken with that in mind.
Before the sit-in began, the community was informed
that the Hospital agreed with five of the six demands
made on it. On one, the rehiring of Sam Bridges, the
answer on Thursday morning was that grievance
procedures are available to him if he wishes to use them.
That answer still stands. If Mr. Bridges wants to file a
grievance, he can be assured of a full and fair airing of
the facts of . •
