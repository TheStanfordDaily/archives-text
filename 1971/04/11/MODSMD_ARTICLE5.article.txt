# McHenry Ticket Takes Plurality

### RALPH KOSTANT 
The slate of McHenry-Fields-Kimball-Diamond
garnered some 36 percent of the presidential vote on its
way to earning a berth in the ASSU run-off election.
According to final election figures released by ASSU
Elections Commissioner Louis Humphrey,
McHenry-Fields received 1 153 votes. The
conservative-libertarian slate of Chris Hocker and Robin
Friedman grabbed the other spot in the run-off election,
which will be held Wednesday and Thursday, April 15
and 16.
Hocker and Friedman received 732 votes, or
percent of the total. They ran on a platform w'
included the abolishment of ASSU.
Next week's run-off ballot will carry one other test of
student interest in retaining student government. Voters
will choose between SO and $3 per quarter in ASSU
program fees.
Budget Initiative Passes
The controversial budget initiative, which sets the
1971-72 appropriations for student organizations, passed
surprisingly easily, 1779-1265. However, some
opponents of the initiative have stated that the measure
effectively amends the ASSU constitution, and therefore
requires a 2/3 majority.
ASSU President Robert Grant yesterday called this
argument "spurious." He explained, "The constitution
states that the student body may pass any legislation
which the Senate can pass, and by a simple majority."
Grant admitted that the power of final interpretation
of the constitution rests with the Senate, but said, "They
would be loolish to act against the will of the student
body."
In any event, the question of constitutionality would
be rendered academic by passage of the $0 fee proposal.
Recruiting Closely Contested
The most closely contested referenda were two
recruiting proposals, one prohibiting military recruiting
on University lands, and the other prohibiting recruiting
by corporations "directly producing" war materials, as
judged by a committee of faculty, staff and students.
Both passed by narrow margins.
The recruiting proposals carry no binding force on
the Board of Trustees other than that of public opinion.
Nevertheless, passage of the two measures indicates that
student attitudes on campus recruiting have changed
drastically in recent years. Only two years ago, a
question almost exactly opposite to the 1971 referenda
passed by just short of a six to one margin. It read,
"Should all employers not illegal in the eyes of the civil
courts be allowed equal access to recruiting facilities?"
Anti-war Sentiment
Proposals for an end to the Indochina War received
strong support from the student electorate. One simply
calling for total withdrawal of American troops by the
end of 1971 passed 2612-583. The Joint Treaty of Peace
met with more opposition, yet still passed by a margin
of over I 300 voles.
Proponents of the so-called People's Peace Treaty
hold that its passage represents more than a statement
against the war. They note that the final clause reads.
"By ratifying the agreement, we pledge to take whatever
actions arc appropriate to implement the terms of this
joint Treaty and to insure its acceptance by the
government of the United States."
The Joint Treaty was drafted by representatives of
the National Student Association, the National
Liberation Front and both North and South Vietnamese
student groups.
Judicial Revision Urged
The Student Rights Proposal passed easily, despite
almost no pre-election publicity. Only a
recommendation, it urged revisions of the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of I9(>N, specifically regarding the
make-up of the SJC and Student Conduct Legislative
Council I hesc bodies arc currently composed of both
faculty and students, even though their jurisdiction
extends only to the student body. Students do not now
possess any similar power of review of faculty conduct.
