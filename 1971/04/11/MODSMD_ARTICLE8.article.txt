# Bridges' Case
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Sam Bridges' firing and the subsequent negotiations
concerning his case have been shrouded by
misunderstanding. Bridges was first hired as a janitor for
the hospital February 22. During his first month on the
job, several complaints were made to his supervisor to
the effect that Bridges was not doing his job.
Because the hospital was concerned about Bridges'
feeling discriminated against, he was asked to attend a
meeting with his supervisor, the hospital minority
relations counselor Shirlee Parish, and the Assistant
Chief of Engineering Warren Thorpe. At that meeting,
Bridges told Parish that he had not asked for her help
and did not need it.
More Complaints
Alter that meeting, Bridges had additional complaints
made against him which included "having words" with
another employee and a security guard. The security
guard told his sergeant who calledThorpe to report the
incident. Thorpe is alleged to have told the sergeant that
he didn't need to worry because Bridges would soon be
fired.
One week later, on March 16, Thorpe gave Bridges
two weeks notice that he would be fired. Thorpe also
told Bridges that grievence procedures were available,
but later told the BAC that he was unclear what
the procedures were and whether they applied to him
since he was in his first six months of employment.
The next step Bridges took was to ask the help of the
Black Students Union, the Black Worker's Caucus and
The Black Liberation Front, a revolutionary group based
in Redwood City. These groups formed the Black United
Front (BUF) and began circulating a leaflet charging that
Bridges had been discriminated against.
When he heard of this leaflet, Cheatham, a member of
the Black Advisory Committee (BAC) initiated an investi
gation into the case. As a result of an initial hearing with
Parish, Thorpe and Bridges supervisor the BAC issued a
statement that stated in part:
"Mr. Bridges was terminated because he was not
doing the job he was hired to do, and therefore putting
an added burden on his co-workers."
BUF Rally
Last Tuesday, the BUF held a rally in Bridges behalf
at which time they presented a list of six demands
including the reinstatement of Bridges to Dr. Thomas
Gonda, Director of the hospital. At that time, the BUF
was led to believe that Gonda would personally give
them a response 48 hours later, Thursday at 1 p.m.
Wednesday, Gonda responded with a list of written
responses to the six demands. He basically agreed to five
of the six demands.
The BUF scheduled a press conference Thursday
morning along with MECHA and Alianza Latina, a
Chicano hospital workers group, to discuss Bridges' case
and that of Dr. Jose Aguilar, a Chicano doctor denied
tenure to the medical school faculty.
After that press conference, the two groups held a
rally and shortly after 1 p.m. marched into the hospital
to hear Gonda's reply to the demands.
When the group which numbered close to 100 got to
Gonda's office, they were met by deputy director Frank
Vitale who passed out Gonda's written response and told
the group that he did not know where Gonda was. Vitale
said he did not think Gonda knew he was expected to
appear in person.
The BUF decided to sit down in the corridor outside
Gonda's office and wait for him.
Facts Left Unmentioned
The BUF met with the BAC that afternoon at which
time Bridges argued that it could not have reviewed the
case since he had never appeared before it. The BAC
announced that "All the facts.. . have not been
presented." A hearing was scheduled for 8 a.m. Friday
morning.
At the Friday morning meeting, several new facts
were presented to the BAC. Among these were:
1. Bridges claimed he was not adequately informed of
his job duties. His supervisor said that he had not
informed Bridges of his duties, but had introduced him
to the foreman. The foreman said he had introduced
Bridges to a fellow worker whom he assumed had
described Bridges duties to him. Bridges was never given
a job description form.
2. The employee who had had the run in with Bridges
described it as "not that serious."
3. One worker who was supposed to have seen
Bridges asleep during his working hours said he had not
actually seen Bridges asleep, but had heard of it.
On the basis of the testimony at this meeting, the
BAC reversed its earlier decision and recommended that
Bridges be immediately rehired.
The BAC immediately thereafter met with Gonda (o
inform him of its recommendations. Gonda decided that

Bridges would have to go through the formal grievance
procedures and he could not rehire Bridges immediately
on his own authority.
As negotiations continued the BUF asked that the
first three of four steps in the grievance procedures be
bypassed, and that they go directly to step four, the
review by Gonda himself.
At this point Gonda ruled that he could not handle
this procedure himself and that some other impartial
person be appointed. The BUF agreed upon Hank
Oregan, and Gonda went to get approval of this
procedure from John L. Wilson, dean of the medical
center, and William Miller, acting President of the
University.
End In Sight
After Gonda left, the BUF met with black hospital
workers and decided to end the sit-in as soon as the
grievance procedures were started according to the plan.
Soon after, however, the BUF received a statement
from Miller saying that:
"1 have Gonda's recommendations under
consideration. However, we agree there will be no
conclusion on the composition or dates for the
Grievance Procedure while the occupation of the
Hospital continues."
Soon after this statement arrived the BUF heard
reports that police were massing. They then barricaded
the doors to the corridor and there were no further
negotiations.


BARRICADE Bookcase, tables, chairs, cabinets were all part of the demonstrators' efforts to hinder the police at
the south end of the occupied area.
