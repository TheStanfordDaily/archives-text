# Police Search 'Daily' For Evidence
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
In an apparently unprecedented
action, four Palo Alto and two
Stanford policemen, using a search
warrant to gain entry, thoroughly
searched the offices of the Daily
yesterday seeking evidence that might
lead to new prosecutions for last
Friday's violent hospital sit-in.
The officers left empty-handed after
spending nearly an hour searching the
entire office including photo files,
desks, personal correspondence, and
several garbage cans.
According to the search warrant
signed by Municipal Court Judge J.
Barton Phelps the police were "to make
immediate search of the premises" for
negatives, film, and any pictures taken
at the hospital showing the sit-in and
following events.
It has been the Daily's policy to
destroy any incriminating evidence so
that it can not be used in criminal or
civil prosecutions. As to the
whereabouts of Daily f'.lm taken during
the sit-in, editor Felicity Barringer
made no comment, pending legal
advice.
The Daily's immediate reaction to

the search was to seek legal advice to
prevent further such occurences.
According to Barringer, "Until it
becomes obvious that the threat of
such a search as today's no longer
exists, we will continue to fight by all
legal means at our disposal any
possibility of our files being used for
evidence in the civil or criminal courts.
"It is extremely difficult for any
news organization to perform its
function in a democratic society if it is
working under the constant threat of
governmental subpoena or a
government-sanctioned search of its
confidential files — be they
photographic files, reporter's notes, or
any of the many documents collected
while reporting the news."
President Richard Lyman said the
University had no advance notice of the
search of the Daily offices.
Legal Investigation
"Whatever the legal situation may
be—and I don't know about that and
am having any possible constitutional
questions investigated—as an act of
policy I consider it deplorable and
threatening to the full freedom of the
press," Lyman said.

Photo editor Lee Greathouse said,
"This year Daily photographers have
been threatened, Maced, and chased
while trying to do their jobs. But
nothing has so seriously affected our
ability to capture the news as this
intimidation by search warrant. Daily
negatives will never be used in court
against political activists."
The search of a newspaper office by
police is apparently without precedent.
Although supoenas of reporters notes
and other evidence have been used
increasingly in recent years no legal or
journalistic authorities contacted by
the Daily had ever heard of this type of
action before.
Asked if they had ever been
searched, the San Jose Mercury

responded, "they wouldn't dare."
According to a San Francisco Chronicle
spokesman, "the search is shocking."
Abe Mellinkoff, Chronicle city editor,
said his newspaper would editorialize
on the incident in tomorrow's paper.
Alexander Bodi, publisher of the Palo
Alto Times said, "I've never heard of
anything like this before."
Under the watchful eyes of reporters
and hurriedly-called lawyers, the
policemen searched painstakingly
through the Daily and "Quad" filing
cabinets and desks in the darkroom,
and through the desks of most regular
Daily staffers, including Barringer's.
They seemed particularly interested in
photographs of other disruptions and in
records and correspondence carried on
by the paper.

the search was to seek legal advice to
prevent further such occurences.
According to Barringer, "Until it
becomes obvious that the threat of
such a search as today's no longer
exists, we will continue to fight by all
legal means at our disposal any
possibility of our files being used for
evidence in the civil or criminal courts.
"It is extremely difficult for any
news organization to perform its
function in a democratic society if it is
working under the constant threat of
governmental subpoena or a
government-sanctioned search of its
confidential files — be they
photographic files, reporter's notes, or
any of the many documents collected
while reporting the news."
President Richard Lyman said the
University had no advance notice of the
search of the Daily offices.
Legal Investigation
"Whatever the legal situation may
be—and I don't know about that and
am having any possible constitutional
questions investigated—as an act of
policy I consider it deplorable and
threatening to the full freedom of the
press," Lyman said.

Photo editor Lee Greathouse said,
"This year Daily photographers have
been threatened, Maced, and chased
while trying to do their jobs. But
nothing has so seriously affected our
ability to capture the news as this
intimidation by search warrant. Daily
negatives will never be used in court
against political activists."
The search of a newspaper office by
police is apparently without precedent.
Although supoenas of reporters notes
and other evidence have been used
increasingly in recent years no legal or
journalistic authorities contacted by
the Daily had ever heard of this type of
action before.
Asked if they had ever been
searched, the San Jose Mercury

responded, "they wouldn't dare."
According to a San Francisco Chronicle
spokesman, "the search is shocking."
Abe Mellinkoff, Chronicle city editor,
said his newspaper would editorialize
on the incident in tomorrow's paper.
Alexander Bodi, publisher of the Palo
Alto Times said, "I've never heard of
anything like this before."
Under the watchful eyes of reporters
and hurriedly-called lawyers, the
policemen searched painstakingly
through the Daily and "Quad" filing
cabinets and desks in the darkroom,
and through the desks of most regular
Daily staffers, including Barringer's.
They seemed particularly interested in
photographs of other disruptions and in
records and correspondence carried on
by the paper.

search for evidence. After rumaging through both the Quad and DAILY files and
finding nothing to satisfy him, he took off in the direction of the Copenhagen
Theater on El Camino.
In an apparently unprecedented
action, four Palo Alto and two
Stanford policemen, using a search
warrant to gain entry, thoroughly
searched the offices of the Daily
yesterday seeking evidence that might
lead to new prosecutions for last
Friday's violent hospital sit-in.
The officers left empty-handed after
spending nearly an hour searching the
entire office including photo files,
desks, personal correspondence, and
several garbage cans.
According to the search warrant
signed by Municipal Court Judge J.
Barton Phelps the police were "to make
immediate search of the premises" for
negatives, film, and any pictures taken
at the hospital showing the sit-in and
following events.
It has been the Daily's policy to
destroy any incriminating evidence so
that it can not be used in criminal or
civil prosecutions. As to the
whereabouts of Daily f'.lm taken during
the sit-in, editor Felicity Barringer
made no comment, pending legal
advice.
The Daily's immediate reaction to

the search was to seek legal advice to
