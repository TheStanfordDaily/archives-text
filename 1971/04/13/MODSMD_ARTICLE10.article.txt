# Crew Wins Regatta
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The Stanford crew opened its
intercollegiate racing season last
Saturday by winning the Conn
Findlay Cup for the eleventh
straight year, in a four-school
regatta with USC, Oregon State,
and Santa Ciara.
In the afternoon finals, the
varsity eight-oared shell pulled
ahead from an even start with
USC to finish with a one length
lead. Their time was 6:45.5 to
USC's 6:50.4.
With a stiff breeze blowing,
Stanford's time was slower than a
course record of 6:26.2 which
they set in their morning heat
against Santa Clara.
The freshman eight took on
Santa Clara for the finals, and by
holding a steady stroke
throughout the race, they
overcame a one second
disadvantage at the 500-meter
mark and won the race by a
length, with a time of 6:41.0 to
Santa Clara's 6:45.8.
Frosh Coach Eric Sigward
commented that his boat "stayed
confident and held on," despite
being down at the start.
In the morning heat, the Junior
Varsity's 21 second victory over
USC made Stanford the only
school to put a boat in each of its
finals. Later the JV boat failed to
keep pace with Oregon, and lost
by three lengths. Oregon's time
was 6:32.2; Stanford's was
6:55.1.
The second freshman boat
nearly upset the Cal lightweight
crew. They lost a one-length lead
halfway through the race when
their coxswain steered the boat
off course by mistake. Stanford
lost by half a second.
The races were the first to be

held at the new 2000 meter
Redwood Shores Lagoon course
near Belmont. This artificial body
of water, filled by pumps from
the bay, is free from tidal currents
and has ample room for
spectators.
The land around the lagoon is
being extensively developed, and
soon much of the course will be
lined with waterfront homes. This
affords a marked contrast to the
former course which was
dominated by a giant salt pile at
one end and several factories
along one side. The spectators
were forced to watch from a dock
beyond the end of the course.
The disadvantage is that the
new course is only wide enough to
race two boats at a time, while the
old one could manage four at
once.
Kent Mitchell, chairman of the
Regatta Committee, says the
course is probably the best in the
Bay Area. He hopes rowing's
popularity as a spectator sport
will increase as a result.
Next weekend the squad will
travel to Eugene to face the
University of Oregon and the
University of Washington. A week
later, they go south to race
UCLA, another tough opponent.
