Ford Speaks
House Republican leader Gerald
Ford (R.Mich.) told a class here
yesterday that he foresees "a zero
draft" in "18 to 24 months."
Said Ford, "If the necessary
contingencies are there—and I believe
they will be—we will have an
all-volunteer army in two years." These
contingencies are a continued "decline
in our manpower commitment" in
Vietnam, and the expected effects of
recent Army pay raises.
Speaking before Professor Robert A.
Horn's American Government class, the
House Minority Leader detailed recent
reforms of the House's much-maligned
seniority system and answered
students' questions.
Among other things, Ford expressed
his support of President Nixon's
welfare reform program, asserted that
J. Edgar Hoover can be removed from
office "any time the Congress wants to
remove him," predicted that "America
will build an SST in the future," and
advised students seeking "responses"
from government to "get Charlie (Rep.
Charles Gubser) to sit down with you
and find out what you think."
Win Fellowships
Three Stanford students are among
70 chosen nationally for Rockefeller

trial year fellowships for theological
studies, the Fund for Theological
Education at Princeton, N.J., has
announced.
Covering all institutional charges,
plus additional funds for miscellaneous
expenses, the fellowships were awarded
Mary C. Carter, a graduate special
student from Rt. 3, Sterling, Col.;
Douglas W. Otto, senior psychology
major from 40 79 Larwin, Cypress, Cal.;
and Marguerite L. Shuster, a 1968
graduate from Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
The fellowships are awarded to those
who would not otherwise attend a
seminary but agree to seriously
consider the possibility of becoming
ordained ministers.
Vandals Attack
The San Francisco headquarters of
the Student Mobilization Committee
(SMC) fell victim to an attack by
vandals Sunday night, but a SMC
spokesman said the march scheduled
for April 24 will not be called off.
SMC workers arrived at their
headquarters at 755 Market St.
yesterday morning, and discovered it
had been completely hosed-down. Files
containing the names of SMC members
as well as the names of financial
supporters of the organization were
stolen. '
