## Blacks Issue Eight New Demands 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
The Black Advisory Committee, representing black
workers, Medical students, and doctors presented late
yesterday a list of eight non-negotiable demands to
Dr. John Wilson, acting dean of the' University School
of Medicine.
The demands, expected to be resolved by 9:00
a.m. Wednesday, are as follows:
—1. "All charges related to all persons who were
arrested in connection with the non-violent
demonstration held at Stanford University Hospital,
April 9, 1971 be dropped. Notwithstanding all legal
fees incurred during this demonstration shall be paid
in full by Stanford.
—2. "Any persons who received any form of injury
because of their direct or indirect involvement in the
demonstration should have all medical expenses paid
in full by Stanford.
—3. "Sam Bridges shall be reinstated and
reimbursed retroactively from date of termination.
—4,5. "Dr. John L. Wilson, active dean of the
Medical School, and Mr. Warren Thorpe, assistant
Chief Engineer, should resign.
—6. "There will be created a separation of the
Stanford University and the Hospital with the latter
having its own autonomy.
—7. "The Black Advisory Committee cannot
function in an advisory capacity without having the
power to represent the total Medical Center which
includes both the Stanford Hospital and the Stanford
School of Medicine.
—8. "The decision-making apparatus must exist
only with horizontal authority. This restructuring is
imperative."
These will be discussed with the Alianza Latina
demands and white Hospital faculty and worker
representatives today.
Statements of support for blacks and chicanos
came from medical students and the AdHoc
Coalition, composed of medical students, medical

school faculty and staff, black, latin, and white
workers.
35 medical students voted to "support the
grievances of the black and chicano employees and
students and condemn the police tactics used last
Friday."
The Coalition stated that it "condemns the calling
of police to settle a peaceful protest of legitimate
grievances" and "supports in every way the struggle
of black and latin workers against racism at Stanford
Medical Center."
Mrs. Nadine Ellis and Mrs. Lovie Lewis, BAC
members, and Mr. Tony Rodriguez of Alianza Latina
emphasized today that agreement with Black United
FVrnt leaders had been reached to end Friday's sit-in
by 6 p.m., but the administration did not consult
BAC before calling the police.
According to Mrs. Ellis, BAC chairman Jim
Cheatham had talked with BUF leaders and it was
agreed that "if word came that Bridges was going
through a grievance procedure, and Henry Organ
(associate general secretary) was the mediator, the
protestors would leave at 6 p.m."
Disruptive
At the Medical School faculty meeting, Dean
Wilson defended his decision to have the police called
in by Acting President William Miller. "I consider the
occupation to be disruptive of hospital
functions... I think it is irresponsible to wait until
there are examples of patient harm to take action."
"Instead of becoming more easy to resolve, they
(sit-ins) become more difficult to resolve .. .
"The sit-in was a threat of force and created an
atmosphere in which sound interpretation and
judgement were exceptionally difficult or impossible.
It seemed unwise to accept an imposed settlement
when there was ready access to another more
effective process such as the grievance procedure (for
Mr. Bridges.)"
However, section 204 of the personnel manual

states "The employee may resign or be terminated for
any reason whatsoever and at any time at the sole
discretion of the employee or hospital without
recourse during the probationary period" which
Bridges was on.
At a rally of 350 people, mostly Hospital workers,
on the Medical Center lawn in the early morning,
black and chicano speakers blasted the
Administration's calling in of police last Friday.
Student Bob King argued, "The time to unite is
now. Get Sam (Bridges) rehired. Get rights for blacks
and browns in the hospital."
Tony Rodriguez, spokesman for the Alianza
Latina, disputed the press accounts of Friday's
action. "Headlines didn't say "17 injuries" but rather
said "$lOO,OOO damage."
Professor St. Clair Drake, director of the African
and Afro-American Program, resipied from the
Committee of Fifteen in protest over the police
action.
In a letter read by Mrs. Shirlee Parish, member'of
the Black Advisory Council, Drake wrote that he was
"not taking a stand" on the Sam Bridges case, but felt
that until the police were summoned "this was a
peaceful sit-in in the Martin Luther King, SNCC
tradition." Because of the University's attitude, "I
can't continue as a member of the Committee of
Fifteen."
Caucuses
Blacks and Chicanos left the rally to hold closed
caucuses to formulate demands. The white hospital
workers and faculty remaining chose representatives
for the black and chicano meeting today to formulate
a united group of demands. Speakers to those
remaining denounced the condition in the emergency
room where a lack of a Spanish speaking person
interferes with medical care.
There will be an information rally on the Medical
School lawn today at 9 a.m. Also, one at White Plaza
with members of the Black Liberation Front at noon.
