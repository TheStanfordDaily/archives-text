# Voters Face Divergent Choices
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
When students vote in the ASSU
elections next Wednesday and
Thursday, they will be faced with two
very different choices. The ticket of
Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman have
campaigned on a platform of
dismantling the ASSU, and ending its
influence on student organizations.
They support a program fee of $0.
TTie presidential slate of Doug
McHenry, Diane Fields, Larry
Diamond, and Ann Kimball want "to
open the ASSU" as an organization
supporting student ideas. They are very
worried that the program fee of $3 will
not pass.
Chris Hocker and Robin Friedman
have both been involved with the Free
Campus Movement (FCM) and Hocker
edits the Arena. He is a sophomore who
describes himself as a "libertarian." He
is an elected member of the SCLC.
Friedman is a junior, was president of
Twain house in Stern Hall and a regular
contributor to the Arena.
Fighting Over Money
"The reason student politics is a
sandbox it is," says Hocker in support
of abolishing student fees, "is that
students are more interested in fighting
over money," "If an organization is
truly legitimate, it will get its own
money," he adds, pointing to the
Arena, which is not supported by the
ASSU.
Adds Friedman, "According to the
research I've done, the Student Senate
'vp*.. formed for educational reform. It
has never formed a standing committee
on academic affairs."
Ijarry Diamond, a sophomore, and
Chairman last year of the Moratorium
Committee, says, "This is an unusually

important election. It has come to rest
on whether the ASSU should continue
to exist." A fee of $0 will "emasculate
or destroy a lot of important campus
organizations," he explains.
Investment In Services
The fee is "not just giving money
away," according to sophomore Doug
McHenry, a member of the BSU and an
intern at Stanford in Washington last
summer. "We view it as an investment
in student services."
Diane Fields, a student senator and
member of the BSU, thinks the $3 fee
is not "too much when you have
organizations that students really
want," such as KZSU, the day care
center, and minority student
organizations.
Hal Mickelson, a member of the
present ASSU council of presidents,
sees two principle myths surrounding
the issue of student fees.
Triple Current Rate
First, a program fee of $3 dollars per
quarter for next year is triple the
present rate of $1 per quarter not the
same. Of the $3 students now pay
above their tuition this year, the extra
two dollars are split between the Daily
and the ASSU Special Events Board.
Second, a fee of zero dollars would
not cut off money entirely from the
ASSU. The council of presidents and
student offices in Tresidder receive
about $90,000 each year directly from
student tuition, and this money is also
used for running the ASSU Senate.
None is used for student programs.
In reference to the choice students
have between a fee of $0 and $3, Bob
Grant takes the position that "It makes
much more sense to pay $3 and keep
the organizations we have."

Both slates of candidates agree that
the president of the ASSU should not
assume that he can personally speak for
the student body. They both criticize
student leaders who assume their role is
to take students by the hand, and show
them what they should be concerned
about.
Larry Diamond thinks the ASSU can
try to open up university decision
processes to students and the people
who work at Stanford. He says, "This
election has come to rest on whether
the ASSU should continue to exist."
Student Participation
"We don't want the ASSU to take
credit for everything," says Doug
McHenry. It is very important that
students participate in the ASSU and
furnish their ideas for it. He adds,
"What's at issue in this election is
whether or not there is support for a
strong student union."
In supporting and advocating
changes in the interest of the student
body, such as lobbying in Washington
for greater federal aid to student
tuition, Diamond feels the ASSU
cannot sensibly try to escape politics.
In fact he says,"The ASSU should be
intensely political."
Apolitical
Chris Hocker thinks it is possible to
run a fairminded ASSU which is
relatively apolitical. "I am opposed to
an activist presidency in the sense of
taking stands on political and social
issues."
"I don't see where politics is any
province of the ASSU except that it
can bo examined fairly through ASSU
offices."


MED-CENTER RALLYâ€”Minority workers expressed deep concern at a rally
held yesterday on the med-center police and administration action during the
sit-in Friday. An informational rally has been scheduled today at 9 a.m. on the
med-school lawn, and a noon rally has been scheduled for white plaza.
Strictly speaking, by advocating a $0
fee, Robin Friedman does not think
this amounts to complete abandonment
of ASSU concern over student
activities. "We don't intend to let
needed services die," she says,
indicating that she will help such
organizations as KZSU to survive.
As an example of the McHenry Field
slate's idea of its kind of leadership,
Diane Fields says, "We're going to
support the general quest for
self-determination among minority
students."
One goal of Ann Kimball, fourth
member of the McHenry-Fields ticket,
a junior, and a member of the
Committee of Fifteen, is improvement
of the status of women on campus. She
suggests changing the ratio in
undergraduate admissions to one where
equal numbers of men and women are
admitted as well as encouraging more
women to go graduate school.
Both groups of candidates have been
accused of being under the control of
special interest groups. McHenry and
Fields are members of the BSU, and
Hocker and Friedman have been
attached to the FCM.
Robin Friedman explains that after a
break with the Young Americans for
Freedom, the FCM was "founded on
libertarian principles" to discuss how
power can be returned to the individual
person.

It became what she calls, "a
glorified photographers club" in recent
times, with too much concern over
identifying individuals at campus
demonstrations and disturbances. She
continued to attend meetings because
she felt that it did not have to continue
that way. She felt she should "force it
to support things for individual
freedom such as abolition of the draft."
When asked to comment on the
recent sit-in at the Medical School,
Hocker called the sit-in "needless."
"They knew if they sat there they
would be thrown out. . . they
welcomed it (the entry by the police.)"
Ann Kimball takes a different view
of the sit-in, which began as a wait on
the part of a number of people for a
scheduled meeting with Dr. Thomas
Gonda. "They had every right to wait
and every right to extend the wait," she
says.
All the candidates will appear
tonight at 7:30 p.m. on KZSU in an
hour-long taped debate. Opening and
closing statements will be made by
both groups.
Included in this week's elections is a
contest for three seats on the student
conduct legislative council.
The candidates and their identifying
numbers on the ballot are: 1. Rocky
Barber; 2. Herb Borock; 3. Yale
Braunstein; 4. Michael Fancher; 5.
James O'Fallon; 6. Irene Pardee; 7.
Ernesto Rael;B. Rexford Stark; 9. Buzz
Thompson; 10. Raymond White.
