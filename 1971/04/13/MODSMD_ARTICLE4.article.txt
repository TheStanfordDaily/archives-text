# 'Sexist-Racist' Policies Challenged In Lawsuit
## 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
President Lyman, Provost Miller, the
deans of undergraduate and graduate
admissions, Fred Hargadon and Lincoln
Moses, and the Board of Trustees have
been named as defendants in a lawsuit
which challenges alleged sixistracist
university policies. A preliminary
hearing has been set for 3:30 p.m.
today at the North County Courthouse,
270 Grant Street in Palo Alto.
According to Dr. Nancy Jewell
Cross, a Stanford alumna , and a
co-plaintiff in the suit, "the Court is
being asked to issue a temporary
restraining order and an order to show
cause, a preliminary injunction, and
permanent injunction against
immediately threatened sex-race
privileged admissions and financial aid
distribution."
Cited Founding Grant
Dr. Cross and her co-plaintiff, Linda
Crouse, a systems programmer at the
medical center cited the founding grant
of Stanford University which says"The
Trustees shall have the power and it

shall be their duty ... to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes. (On May
11 , 1933 the Trustees passed a
resolution limiting the total women
enrollment to 40%).
"The quoted terms of their (the
Stanford') authority exist," reads the
complaint which was filed last week in
superior court, "but Stanford
defendants have refused and refuse to
conduct their offices at Stanford
University consistently therewith."
"The lengthy document which
invites the State of California and the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare to intervene as co-plaintiffs,
asserts the "public and state character"
of the University and calls upon the
Court to enjoin the institution from
pursuing policies which are allegedly
sexist and racist if its current
tax-exempt status and $50 million in
annual federal funding are to continue.
Undergraduate Admissions
Dr. Cross, who was a graduate
student here in chemistry, sharply
criticized the undergraduate admissions
policy which allegedly establishes
quotas before applications are received.
In the text of the complaint, Dr. Cross
asserted, "Without collating
qualifications of applicants
competitively, defendant dean of
admissions (Hargadon) announced in
December 19 70 to the press
that. . . the freshman class at Stanford
University for Fall 1971 would consist
of 500 women, 900 men, 75 blacks, 71
Mexican-Americans, and 21 American
Indians, the same as it was the year
before!" Hargadon could not be
reached for comment
She also cited the $5 million
Katherine McCormick trust which was
established for the benefit of women in
medicine. According to Dr. Cross, the
medical school makes little effort "to
make the fund known generally to
women and practically available to
persons within the donor's concern."
Instead, she charged, the university is
using the funds in other areas.
However, Iris Brest, a University
attorney in the General Secretary's
office who has been assigned to the
case, said, "the McCormick money goes
to the medical school with no
restrictions. There is a preference to use
it towards women in medicine."
Notice of Acceptance
Dr. Cross' charges of sexist and racist
admissions policies and financial aid
distributions comes during the very
week that high school seniors are
notified of their acceptance to the
University's freshman class. Despite the
legal action taken by Dr. Cross the
undergraduate admissions office
reported that notices of acceptance
were mailed yesterday.
In addition to asking for the
withdrawal or tax-supported
exemptions, contracts and grants from
the State and federal government, Dr.
Cross and Crouse are each seeking
$10,000 in damages.

distributions comes during the very
week that high school seniors are
notified of their acceptance to the
University's freshman class. Despite the
legal action taken by Dr. Cross the
undergraduate admissions office
reported that notices of acceptance
were mailed yesterday.
In addition to asking for the
withdrawal or tax-supported
exemptions, contracts and grants from
the State and federal government, Dr.
Cross and Crouse are each seeking
$10,000 in damages.
President Lyman, Provost Miller, the
deans of undergraduate and graduate
admissions, Fred Hargadon and Lincoln
Moses, and the Board of Trustees have
been named as defendants in a lawsuit
which challenges alleged sixistracist
university policies. A preliminary
hearing has been set for 3:30 p.m.
today at the North County Courthouse,
270 Grant Street in Palo Alto.
According to Dr. Nancy Jewell
Cross, a Stanford alumna , and a
co-plaintiff in the suit, "the Court is
being asked to issue a temporary
restraining order and an order to show
cause, a preliminary injunction, and
permanent injunction against
immediately threatened sex-race
privileged admissions and financial aid
distribution."
Cited Founding Grant
Dr. Cross and her co-plaintiff, Linda
Crouse, a systems programmer at the
medical center cited the founding grant
of Stanford University which says"The
Trustees shall have the power and it

shall be their duty ... to afford equal
facilities and give equal advantages in
the University to both sexes. (On May
11 , 1933 the Trustees passed a
resolution limiting the total women
enrollment to 40%).
"The quoted terms of their (the
Stanford') authority exist," reads the
complaint which was filed last week in
superior court, "but Stanford
defendants have refused and refuse to
conduct their offices at Stanford
University consistently therewith."
"The lengthy document which
invites the State of California and the
Department of Health, Education and
Welfare to intervene as co-plaintiffs,
asserts the "public and state character"
of the University and calls upon the
Court to enjoin the institution from
pursuing policies which are allegedly
sexist and racist if its current
tax-exempt status and $50 million in
annual federal funding are to continue.
Undergraduate Admissions
Dr. Cross, who was a graduate
student here in chemistry, sharply
criticized the undergraduate admissions
policy which allegedly establishes
quotas before applications are received.
In the text of the complaint, Dr. Cross
asserted, "Without collating
qualifications of applicants
competitively, defendant dean of
admissions (Hargadon) announced in
December 19 70 to the press
that. . . the freshman class at Stanford
University for Fall 1971 would consist
of 500 women, 900 men, 75 blacks, 71
Mexican-Americans, and 21 American
Indians, the same as it was the year
before!" Hargadon could not be
reached for comment
She also cited the $5 million
Katherine McCormick trust which was
established for the benefit of women in
medicine. According to Dr. Cross, the
medical school makes little effort "to
make the fund known generally to
women and practically available to
persons within the donor's concern."
Instead, she charged, the university is
using the funds in other areas.
However, Iris Brest, a University
attorney in the General Secretary's
office who has been assigned to the
case, said, "the McCormick money goes
to the medical school with no
restrictions. There is a preference to use
it towards women in medicine."
