Yesterday's search of the Daily office for
photographic evidence relating to last Friday's
violent sit-in was one more in a growing list of
examples of the intimidation and harrasment being
inflicted on the news media by governmental
agencies. It is the function of the press to inform
as many people as possible of decisions and events
affecting their lives. The facts imparted by the
press give these people a chance to affect these
decisions and events, by arming them with
knowledge. If this function is impaired in any way,
the ability of these people to control their own
lives is jeapordi/.ed. In light of this, it is extremely
difficult, if not impossible for any news
organization to perform its function in a
democratic society if it is constantly under the
threat of a governmental subpoena or a
government-sanctioned search of its premises.
A search such as yesterday's is particularly
devastating to a newspaper's ability to keep its
own confidential files. Although no evidence
relating to Friday's demonstration was found
yesterday, all photographic and editorial files were
examined. Since this search was made, the
possibility that subpoenas might be issued at a
later date for material officers saw during this
fishing expedition does not seem remote.

Monday morning quarterbacking, of a football
game or a campus disruption, has little meaning in
terms of the actual events being examined. Its
usefulness is largely limited to suggesting
guidelines for action in possible future occurences.
In this light, we offer our reactions to the events
of last Friday.
We cannot help but think that the decision to
call the police to the scene of the sit-in was
disastrous. When the police were called,
negotiations were proceeding satisfactorily,
although the administration was unaware of the
fact. While the administration has defended its
actions on the grounds that patients were being
disturbed, it is evident that not all doctors with
patients concerned were consulted. Furthermore,
the demonstrators were neither clearly nor
specifically informed how their presence
endangered patient welfare. Finally, the nature of
the demonstrators made a violent response to
police presence very likely, though not inevitable.
The case of the fired custodian, Sam Bridges, is
almost as complex as the sit-in his firing
precipitated. We are studying the charges made
against him and will discuss the validity of those
charges in a later editorial.
, Thus, the administration decision to wash its

It has been the Daily's standing policy to
destroy all potentially incriminating unpublished
photographic material. That policy, while
regrettable, is a necessity. It hampers our ability to
keep files which may be of future informational
use. However, more important even than keeping
these files is the necessity for a news organization
to keep itself from becoming a filing service for
evidence to be used in civil or criminal courts.
Until such a time as it becomes evident that the
threat of actions such as yesterday's no longer
exists, we will stand by this policy.
We also intend to examine all possible legal
roads that may lead to the prevention of acts such
as yesterday's search. In a truly free society, the
news media and the government must remain as
far separated from each other as possible. The use
of searches, subpoenas, and all other forms of
governmental harrassment obviously have a
chilling effect on the freedom of the media to
exercise the rights guaranteed them by the First
Amendment. If the government of this country,
both on the national and local level, continues to
employ intimidating tactics, it must be challenged
at every step of the way. This is the only possible
answer to actions such as yesterday's, if we are to
have a truly free press.

hands of the sit-in and give final authority in the
matter to the police was both unwise and
unwarranted. The events of Friday clearly
demonstrate that the circle from which that
decision emerged is too small and too closed. More
input about the status of the negotiations, the
welfare of the patients, or the nature of the
demonstrators could have forestalled the tragedy.
We are less certain in our analysis of the actions
and tactics of the demonstrators. Our editorial
board is evenly divided as to the question of their
resistance. Half of the board feels that the building
of a barricade and the subsequent fighting with the
police was unwarranted, that a nonviolent reaction
to the police presence was in order. The other half
understands the demonstrators' actions, holding
that their response to the arrival of the police was
inevitable.
Most of us agree that the destruction of the
offices was unwarranted. The damaging of
furniture and the scattering of files has no rational
defense in our minds.
If we are to learn anything from the events of last
Friday, it is that decisions to use police force may
have unexpected consequences. Both Provost
Miller and President Lyman had best anticipate
them in the future.
