Most Abhor War
Editor, THE DAILY:
In his remarks in San Francisco
last Thursday evening, David
Packard implied that it is only a
few "radicals" who are upset with
what he is doing as Deputy
Secretary of Defense. We must
make clear to Mr. Packard that
abhorrance of the war in
southeast Asia, and criticism of
those who keep it going, is not
limited to "radicals," or David
Harris, or "Pete McCloskey's
campaign committee," but is
shared by the great majority of
the American people, including
the great majority of the Stanford
community. His comments make
doubly important that the letter
we are sending him, urging his
resignation as Deputy Secretary of
Defense, be signed by as many
people as possible. (A full text of
the letter was published in last
Wednesday's Daily.) We therefore
announce that there will be copies
of the letter available for signing
at the following places today from
11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.:
Engineering corner, the inner
Quad, White Plaza (also on
Wednesday and Thursday),
entrance to the Faculty Club, the
Medical School courtyard.
Please take time during your
lunch hour to find the table
nearest you and add your name.

No Experience
Editor, THE DAILY:
We would like to call the
attention of the Stanford
community to a class being
offered this week at the College of

San Mateo. The subject of the
class is Legal Abortion and it is
presented by a four-member
panel: a gynecologist, a
psychiatrist, a lawyer from the
San Mateo District Attorney's
staff and a priest. An interesting
feature of the panel is that all the
members are male.
The composition of the panel
epitomizes two of the outstanding
problems faced by women. First,
women are not adequately
represented in the professional
fields. Second, not only are
women's actions controlled by the
male power structure, but the
very nature of women is defined
by men, in this case, how they
should feel and what they should
do about an unwanted pregnancy.
Because of the small percentage
of women in the professions from
which the panel members were
drawn, it would have been
difficult to assemble a more
balanced group. Of 53
gynecologists listed in the Palo
Alto directory, 2 are women. Of
93 psychiatrists, 9 are women.
There are no women lawyers on
the staff of the District Attorney's
office in San Mateo. There are, of
course, no female Roman Catholic
priests.
The spectacle of an all-male
panel deliberating on an issue of
which they can have no direct
experience seems to us ridiculous.
We suggest that any readers who
share our impression attend this
class in order to make their
opinions known. The class meets
on Wednesday evening, April 14,
from 7 to 1 0 p.m. in the Gallery

Room at the College of San Mateo
at 1 7 00 West Hillsdale Boulevard,
and is open to the public.
It is time for women to start
speaking up for themselves.

Let's Find Out
Editor, THE DAILY:
Out of the predictably boring
articles on the ASSU elections
yesterday, two things seem clear.
First, the reaction of some of the
most politically adept student
Senators to the imminent passage
of the $0 program fee is a strong
argument in its behalf. For the
past two years, the Senate has
been a giant playpen for those
students who have been to
Washington once too often and
now have the "real picture" of
politics.
And yet, because many
students still participate in
student government, either
directly or by voting, the Senate
maintains some semblance of
legitimacy. If the $0 program fee
is passed for next year, the Senate
can still meet and play the same
games that they have these past
two years.
On the other hand, if you see
some Senators getting upset about
offering student voters the $0
alternative, ask yourself if that
might not be the very best reason
to divest the Senate of the
legitimacy that it has clearly
demonstrated it does not deserve.
Secondly, the annual dumping
of hundreds of platitudes by the
Residential candidates should
make students wonder why we
must suffer through all this tripe
every year. The Stanford Liberal
probably views it all as another

aspect of his psychologically
necessary self-flagellation.
Admittedly, it feels good when
it's over.
However, it is time that
students realize that there is no
effective substitute for individual
action and voluntary association.
Think of the huge impact that
student government has had on
your life this year. Imagine the
chaos that would result if it didn't
exist. Could you go on living
without it? Why don't we try it
and find out? If all that comes out
of it is not having to read more
boring election articles next year.
It will have been worth it.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The Stanford Chapter of the
National Lawyers Guild condems
the unprovoked and vicious attack
perpetrated upon peaceful
demonstrators protesting the
racist firing of Sam Bridges by
Stanford. The police riot was
completely unnecessary in view of
the fact that serious negotiations
were under way and approaching
a conclusion. The only way to
interpret the calling of police is
that the university administration,
in particular, Miller, Rosensweig,
and Schwartz, feared a successful
resolution in favor of Mr. Bridges.
As we see it, this instance
demonstrates the unwillingness of
the university to give a black
worker a fair hearing and to allow
employees to organize in their
own interest. Given the fact that
Stanford is the dominant
institution in this area, employees
must be allowed to appeal for
support to the broader
community - which includes
students, workers, area residents,
and faculty. This particularly
repressive action indicates the
university's fear of Third World
peoples joining together for
political power.
The multiple felony and
misdemeanor charges against the
demonstrators is another example
of the political repression carried
out by the university, the police,
and the court system. All charges
against the demonstrators must be
dropped immediately.
