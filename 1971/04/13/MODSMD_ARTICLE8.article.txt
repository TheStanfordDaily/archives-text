### 
Stanford served and volleyed its
way to a 7-2 conference victory
over Cal Saturday. Leading the
once-beaten Indians was
sophomore sensation Roscoe
Tanner who accounted for two
important Stanford points.
Tanner led off the dual meet by
downing Bob Alloo 7-6, 6-2.
Frosh Alex Mayer ripped JC
transfer Steve Stefanki 6-0, 6-2.
Rick Fisher and Paul Sidone
outlasted their opponents in
three-set victories to help the
sweep through Cal's top five
singles. Stan Pasarell clinched the

match with a win at fourth
singles.
In doubles, Tanner and Mayer
rallied to whip Stefanki and Mike
Mullan 4-6, 6-1, 6-2. Fisher and
Pasarell lost at second doubles,
while Coach Gould teamed senior
MacClaflin with Gery Groslimond
at third doubles for the Indians'
seventh winning combination of
the day.
The Tribe continues its home
season Tuesday with a match
against Redlands, UCLA on
Friday, USC on Saturday, and a
exhibition with LaJolla High
School Monday.
