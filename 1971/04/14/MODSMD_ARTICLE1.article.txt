# MECHA Asks Tenure For Aguilar
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
MECHA, the Chicano student organization,
presented a petition to the President's office
yesterday, demanding the immediate rehiring and
promotion of Dr. Jose Aguilar to a tenured position
in the Medical School. The demands followed a noon
rally which began the "Semana Cultural."
A group of 150 students marched from the rally in
White Plaza to the inner quad where Gary Cavazos,
Jose Santos, and Raul Alvarez delivered the petition
to Wayne Price, assistant to the provost. President
Lyman, to whom the petition was addressed, was
meeting in San Francisco with the Board of Trustees.
Tenure Denied
Dr. Aguilar, the only Chicano member of the
medical school faculty, has been denied tenure and
refused reappointment to the faculty, due to alleged
incompetence. This is the only ground on which such
a refusal can be made. MECHA, the National Chicano
Health Organization, the Alianza Latina, the Stanford
Medical Student Association, and the Black United
Front charge that he is being dismissed for racial and
political reasons. Faculty at the medical school deny
the allegations, contending that failings in Aguilar's
research, and poor relations with patients, faculty,
and staff, and students were the basis for their
r1 'cisions.

The noon rally, attended by 200 people was
dedicated to Dr. Aguilar. It was the first of four
noon rallies scheduled for the Semana Cultural
(Culture Week), which is an initiation of an ongoing
effort to bring Chicano culture to the university.
Chicano Theatre
Yesterday's rally featured the Teatro De La Gente,
a San Jose theatre group, who performed despite the
rain. Their skits portrayed the overthrow of the white
power structure and Chicano youths being destroyed
by materialism.
Today's rally in White Plaza will feature a rock
band. In addition, the Teatro De Las Calaveras will
perform in Mem Chu at 7:30 p.m. The Teatro
Popular will visit White Plaza on Thursday, while Los
Mascarones will be on stage in Mem Chu.
Issue Statement
In a statement issued last night, 10 Chicano
administrators, faculty members, and staff personnel,
announced their support of Dr. Aguilar, calling for a
re-examination of the decision. They said:
We the undersigned Chicano Administrators, Staff
and Eaculty, deplore the arbitrary decision of the
Medical School not to give tenure to Dr. Jose Aguilar.
We object, in particular, to the manner in which the
entire case has been handled.
We have been told that there have been no

"irregularities" in the various reviews that have been
made beginning with the initial decision and ending
with the Provost's review. We contend that there have
been irregularities. (1) Dr. Aguilar was not given
documented reasons for his dismissal after having
requested them. (2) At an open meeting on April 5,
members of the Dept. of Surgery (four deans and one
department chairman) who partook in the original
decision admitted that they did not feel competent to
judge Dr. Aguilar's work; they, therefore, voted on
the basis of the chairman of the neurosurgery
division's opinion in this matter. (3) Obstacles in the
way of Dr. Aguilar's fulfillment of his obligations for
tenure have not been taken into account.
The University's attitudes and actions in this case
have not been in keeping with its commitment to the
Chicano community on campus and to a strong
Affirmative Action program. We are not asking that
Dr. Aguilar be kept on because he is a Chicano; we
believe that all faculty should be judged on their
competence and performance. The implications of
not rehiring Dr. Aguilar go beyond his individual case
and affect the entire Chicano community.

MECHA, the Chicano student organization,
presented a petition to the President's office
yesterday, demanding the immediate rehiring and
promotion of Dr. Jose Aguilar to a tenured position
in the Medical School. The demands followed a noon
rally which began the "Semana Cultural."
A group of 150 students marched from the rally in
White Plaza to the inner quad where Gary Cavazos,
Jose Santos, and Raul Alvarez delivered the petition
to Wayne Price, assistant to the provost. President
Lyman, to whom the petition was addressed, was
meeting in San Francisco with the Board of Trustees.
Tenure Denied
Dr. Aguilar, the only Chicano member of the
medical school faculty, has been denied tenure and
refused reappointment to the faculty, due to alleged
incompetence. This is the only ground on which such
a refusal can be made. MECHA, the National Chicano
Health Organization, the Alianza Latina, the Stanford
Medical Student Association, and the Black United
Front charge that he is being dismissed for racial and
political reasons. Faculty at the medical school deny
the allegations, contending that failings in Aguilar's
research, and poor relations with patients, faculty,
and staff, and students were the basis for their
r1 'cisions.

The noon rally, attended by 200 people was
dedicated to Dr. Aguilar. It was the first of four
noon rallies scheduled for the Semana Cultural
(Culture Week), which is an initiation of an ongoing
effort to bring Chicano culture to the university.
Chicano Theatre
Yesterday's rally featured the Teatro De La Gente,
a San Jose theatre group, who performed despite the
rain. Their skits portrayed the overthrow of the white
power structure and Chicano youths being destroyed
by materialism.
Today's rally in White Plaza will feature a rock
band. In addition, the Teatro De Las Calaveras will
perform in Mem Chu at 7:30 p.m. The Teatro
Popular will visit White Plaza on Thursday, while Los
Mascarones will be on stage in Mem Chu.
Issue Statement
In a statement issued last night, 10 Chicano
administrators, faculty members, and staff personnel,
announced their support of Dr. Aguilar, calling for a
re-examination of the decision. They said:
We the undersigned Chicano Administrators, Staff
and Eaculty, deplore the arbitrary decision of the
Medical School not to give tenure to Dr. Jose Aguilar.
We object, in particular, to the manner in which the
entire case has been handled.
We have been told that there have been no

"irregularities" in the various reviews that have been
made beginning with the initial decision and ending
with the Provost's review. We contend that there have
been irregularities. (1) Dr. Aguilar was not given
documented reasons for his dismissal after having
requested them. (2) At an open meeting on April 5,
members of the Dept. of Surgery (four deans and one
department chairman) who partook in the original
decision admitted that they did not feel competent to
judge Dr. Aguilar's work; they, therefore, voted on
the basis of the chairman of the neurosurgery
division's opinion in this matter. (3) Obstacles in the
way of Dr. Aguilar's fulfillment of his obligations for
tenure have not been taken into account.
The University's attitudes and actions in this case
have not been in keeping with its commitment to the
Chicano community on campus and to a strong
Affirmative Action program. We are not asking that
Dr. Aguilar be kept on because he is a Chicano; we
believe that all faculty should be judged on their
competence and performance. The implications of
not rehiring Dr. Aguilar go beyond his individual case
and affect the entire Chicano community.
This statement was signed by Carlos Jackson,
Lorenzo A. Esquibel, Ray Caldera, Maria Baeza,
Maria Gutierrez, Jose I. Santos, Gil Chavez, Renato
Rosaldo, Arturo Islas, Lilia Garfinkle.
