# inadequate at any price
## Profit Drive Maims National Health Insurance 
### 
The current crisis in health care
delivery has become one of the
central domestic issues of the
year. Nixon, the A.M.A.,
hospitals, labor unions, and other
groups are all coming forth with a
variety of proposals for National
Health Insurance in attempts to
deal with the health care crisis.
There are many forces pushing
for some form of National Health
Insurance in the very near future.
On the one hand, the public, the
people who need health care, are
led by the mass media to expect
medical miracles, but cannot
obtain even ordinary care in an
adequate fashion. On the other
hand, labor, management,
hospitals, Blue Cross, the
hospital-supply companies, and
local and state governments are
each faced with diverse problems
which arise from the breakdown
of the old systems of health care
financing. In the words of the
Health Policy Advisory
Commiee's book, The American
Health Empire: Power, Profits,
and Politics (Vintage, 1971, p.
177):
The hospitals find themselves
near collapse as costs skyrocket
and financing fails to keep up.
This threatens not only the
institutions themselves, but also
the mulii-billion-dollar drug and
hospital supply companies which
depend on the hospitals as a retail
outlet for their products. At the
same time that the hospitals weep
because of inadequate funds, the
providers of funds groan under
the weight of the hospitals. Bind
Cross is forced to raise its rates
and face its enraged subscribers.
The trade unions find themselves
allocating an ever-increasing
portion of wage hikes merely to
maintain their present level of
health benefits. Employee health
plans cut an ever bigger bite out
of corporate profits. Even the
government feels the pinch as
Medicare and Medicaid costs
knock the budget for a loop.
Two Health Crises
All of the proposed forms of
National Health Insurance now
being paraded before the public,
despite their real differences, are
simply attempts to put the
financing of medical care on a
sounder basis. They all ignore the
most fundamental fact about the
current health crisis—which is that
there are not one, but two crises.
One crisis is a result of the
breakdown of the old systems of

financing. But the second, the
crisis felt by the users of health
care services, is the failure of the
present system to deliver adequate
health care at any price.
Poorer people, Third World
people especially, are becoming
increasingly aware that the
medical care they receive does
nothing to deal with the social,
economic, or environmental causes
of their illnesses. They are
experimented upon and used as
teaching material. The hospitals
and doctors they rely on are
totally unaccountable to the
people they serve, and are not
responsive to their needs. Middle
class people, too, know about the
long delays in overcrowded
waiting rooms, the high costs, and
the contradiction between
"medical moonshots" such as
heart transplants, and the
problems of finding a good doctor
for ordinary problems such as
asth ma.
Three Major Plans
What are the different
proposals for National Health
Insurance? There are three major
plans. One is the A.M.A.'s
"Medicredit." This is a national
system of incentives to encourage
individuals voluntarily to purchase
private insurance. The incentive
comes as an income tax credit.
Poor people would be able to buy
private health insurance at
government expense. Thus, under
this plan, the present system of
free-for-service medicine and
private insurance carriers would
be maintained. No attempt is
made to improve the nature and
quality of health care delivery,
only the financing of it.
The second plan is Nixon's
"National Health Insurance
Partnership." This plan involves

the mandatory purchase of
insurance through
employer-employee contributions.
There would be partially
subsidized private health
insurance for poor families with
children. Exempted from the
mandatory employer contribution
would be "state and local
governments, the self-employed,
and organizations or persons
employing domestics or seasonal,
part-time workers." (SF
Chronicle, 2/20/71).
In addition, the individual
consumer of health care would
still have to pay up to 25% of his
bill, which in the event of a major
illness would be devastating to
most people. Nixon has included
the concept of "Health
Maintainence Organizations" in
his proposal —but these
organizations would essentially be
pre-paid group practices, along the
lines of Kaiser, and would not
represent something new.
The third major proposal for
National Health Insurance is
Edward Kennedy's "Health
Security Program." This plan,
which has the backing of labor,
would provide compulsory health
insurance for everyone regardless
of age, with the government
acting as the insurer, as it does in
the case of Social Security. Unlike
both Medicredit and the Nixon
proposal, this proposal would
provide comprehensive
benefits—including unlimited
hospitalization and complete
outpatient coverage. Longterm
nursing home care, drugs, and
adult dental services would not be
covered, however, at least
initially. Money for this plan
would come from general federal
tax revenues (40% and
employer-employee contributions

in the form of payroll taxes(6o%).
Kennedy's proposal does
attempt a reorganization of the
health care delivery system, in
that it would establish economic
incentives for doctors who
practice in remote, doctor-poor
areas. There would also be a
setting of budgeting priorities on a
regional basis, institution of cost
controls, possibly the
establishment of a resources
development fund to stimulate
more rapid changes, and the
establishment of advisory- boards
on both a national and regional
level.
No Fundamental Solutions
Even the Kennedy plan,
however, does not fundamentally
face the crisis of the nature and
quality of health care delivery. All
three proposals will, at least in
part, reinforce the fee-for-service
system, thereby helping to
preserve this fragmentary, costly,
and inefficient form of delivering
health care. All the proposals will
leave the system dependent on
unaccountable, profit-oriented,
private health insurance
companies. Even the Kennedy
plan, in which the government is

the insurer, will probably use Blue
Cross or commercial insurance
companies to administer the plan.
None of the plans proposes an
adequate and equitable
mechanism for controlling costs.
Even Kennedy's plan, which
includes cost controls and
economic incentives, does not
propose any direct control over
the immensely profitable business
of the "medical-industrial
complex," through —for
example—nationalization of the
drug industry. All the plans
involve fiat-rate employer-em
ployee payroll taxes—thus they
take a bigger proportional bite out
of the wages of low-paid workers
than of high-paid workers.
Finally, none of the plans provide
for meaningful con
sumer-community participation in
program planning or in budgeting.
It is clear that National Health
Insurance, in one form or another,
will help a few people get badly
needed health care. But it is also
clear that no form of National
Health Insurance is going to
resolve the fundamental crisis of
health care delivery, as distinct
from the crisis of health care

financing.
The basic problems of
i nsti tu tional inaccessibility,
doctor-patient relationships,
control by doctors of priorities of
allocating funds, unaccountability
of hospitals to the communities'
medical needs, lack of emphasis
on preventive medicine, will not
be solved by any form of National
Health Insurance. This is because
the fundamental issue is one of
power, of who controls the health
care delivery system.
A truly progressive national
health plan—based on community
controlled health centers, massive
increases in health manpower
especially from Third World
groups and women, the complete
elimination of profit-making
corporations from the health care

system, and a financing
mechanism in which the rich pay
their share—such a plan will be
possible only when power over
the system is taken out of the
hands of those who now have it,
and given to the public, the
people who need the benefits of
the health care system.
In turn, this power of control
will belong to the people only
when there have been
fundamental social and economic
changes in the structure and
nature of our society. It is clear
that National Health Insurance,
which has a great deal to do with
shoring up profits, has very little
to do with bringing about any of
these necessary changes.
