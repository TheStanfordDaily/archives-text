# Excellent Unknowns Back Up Winter
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Most rock shows feature one or
maybe two top groups with
usually undistinguished
preliminary groups. But every
once in a while all the groups in a
show turn out to be good, even
the relatively unknown ones.
n Such was the case this past
weekend at Fillmore West. The
news that Dream and J. Geils
would be playing this weekend
4idn't really make me want to
hurry over and buy some tickets.
But since the albino guitar
master Johnny Winter was
headlining with his new group,
•U>hnny Winter And, I decided to
spend another Saturday night at
Bill Graham's palace. Johnny
Winter And put on an expectedly
fine show, but the unexpected

talent and polish that the other
two groups displayed turned out
to be the highlight of the show.
Original Approach
Dreams is a New York group
structured in the Chicago and
Blood, Sweat and Tears vein, with
three brass pieces, two guitars, an
organ and drums.
But their material is
refreshingly original. Their horns
all sound clear and sharp and their
trumpet player did a fantastic solo
in which he worked with the
sound system to develop some
strange new tones.
Their lead singer has a clear and
extremely articulate voice,
something often lacking in a lot or
rock, and he is well-equipped to
handle both rock and blues. They
have a fine drummer and an

insane tambourinist who probably
uses more energy to shake his
tambourine than any other
member of the group uses with his
instrument.
Greasy And Funky
The second group, J. Geils, was
probably even more impressive.
They are a hard-driving,
down-home style group who get
into some truly funky material.
They have a fine lead singer,
Peter Wolf, who dresses in
all-black clothes, wears sunglasses,
and who jerks and moves
somewhat in a modified Joe
Cocker style.
But some people would say
their act is led by an amazing
harmonica player called "Magic-
Dick." Dick wears a black suede
tuxedo and plays a harmonica

comparable to John Mayall. As
Wolf said, "Magic Dick is greasy!"
Throat Problems
After preliminary groups like
these, Winter would have had to
put on an utterly fantastic show
to really overshadow the pleasant
surprise they provided. Winter had
some trouble with his voice due to
some throat problems incurred
during a long list of engagements,
but he still put on a fine show.
With three guitars putting out
at near full power, Winter's group
almost blows you out of the
auditorium. Standing over 150
feet away you could still feel the
floor vibrate with every note.
Wearing jeans, a "Cocaine"
tee-shirt and a black farmer's hat,
which he soon removes to fully
expose his long, straight, white
hair, Winter is quite a captivating
figure. And his outstanding guitar
technique is quite evident from
the first number he plays.
He plays some incredible hard
rock quitar and then gets right
into some really good Texas blues.
He switches guitars midway
through the act and he is
constantly moving up and down,
and back and forth across the
stage, rocking away.
His new back-up group is
composed of three members of
the old McCoys group, whose
major claim to fame was the
immortal classic, "Hang on
Sloopy."
Derringer plays the lead guitar
and sings in an outstanding rock
and roll medley which includes
"Great Balls of Fire," "Long Tall
Sally" and "Whole Lotta Shakin'
Goin' On." His ability on guitar is
quickly established by his
performance of these 1950's

classics.
As with any group which has
just recorded a new album,
Johnny Winter And plays a
number of cuts off that album,
for obvious reasons.
Outstanding Album
Among the songs on this
outstanding album recorded live
at Fillmore East (Columbia
C 30475) which they performed
Saturday, were the
aforementioned medley, "Jumpin'
Jack Flash," "Good Morning
Little School Girl" and probably
Winter's most well known song,
the old Chuck Berry hit, "Johnny
B. Goode."
Even the light show by Optic
Illusion, was better than usual.
They used a number of beautiful
slides of people and places to
offset the monotony of the usual
oozing, amoeba-type color
patterns, and their between-act
movies and cartoons were
priceless.
All in all, it was one of the
finest Fillmore shows in recent
memory.
