# Rosenfield To Stage 'Woyzeck'
## 
### 
The Drama Department will
present an 11-performance run of
George Buchner's "Woyzeck"
starting tonight and running
continuously through April 24,
except for Sunday, April 18.
The production will be staged
in a new 300-seat flexible arena
that has been constructed on the
stage of Memorial Auditorium.
Using the giant Mem Aud stage
as a theater entire unto itself has
been a goal of several theater

groups in the last few years.
Director Stephen Rosenfield, a
second year M.F.A. student,
managed to cut through the many
barriers that had stopped others,
not the least of which being lack
of funds and a score of fire
ordinances.
Acceptable bleachers were
found to be available at a cost low
enough to permit scene designer
Robert Darling to creat an
artistically satisfying set.

The arena theater will bring the
spectators close to the action, and
is small enough to remove the
need for reserved seating.
The continuous run (excepting
Sunday) gives students a total of
six performances available at $1.
The opening night and weekend
evening rate for students is $2.
Regular prices have been reduced
to $2.25 week nights and matinee,
and $2.75 on opening night and
weekends.
