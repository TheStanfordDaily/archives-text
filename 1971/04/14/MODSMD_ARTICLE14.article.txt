Along with almost every other Western institution that one can
think of, the Catholic Church is in one of the most difficult periods in its
200 year history. The Church is divided into two internal factions
which are battling for its soul.
One group wishes to continue the century-old practice of remaining
aloof from society, demanding that the world come to it. The other
group wants to change the fundament al direction of the Church and
bring it into an immediate relationship with its society.
This faction sees the Church as the greatest potential instrument of
social change available in the modern world. In America the
unchallanged leaders of this faction are two brothers, both of them
priests—Philip and Daniel Berrigan.
These two books deal with the public and private lives of this
remarkable pair. They both give ample evidence of the personal
powers of the two men who have led the battle to change the
American Catholic Church from an "Irish ghetto" into a revolutionary
institution.
They are very personal volumes. They deal with particular people
and not with the age. Yet the age is so well reflected in the lives and
thoughts of these men that such distinctions soon become
unimportant.
The journey through the lives of the Berrigans reads much like the
development of the mentality of the American Left over the past
decade.
Philip Berrigan, the first Catholic priest in the history of the United
States to serve time as a political prisoner, is shown here involved with

civil rights movements in the early sixties. We see why and how he
moves to his first conscious act of lawbreaking when he pours blood
over Baltimore draft records in 1967.
Even the meetings and conversations preceding the famous
Catsonville Nine raid in May, 1968 are given in detail.
And, when the judge says at the end of the trial that "the issues
affected him profoundly as a man but could not be raised before him
in his legal robes," we ask along with Berrigan what kind of a society
demands this division between humanity and law.
Yet these are not solely books about large issues. They deal with
living, breathing men, and their strength stems from this source. The
sections which come off the best in both books are the tiny personal
scenes.
Daniel Berrigan's description of a picnic with the other members of
the Catsonville Nine after their arrest is a prime example of this.
As the picnic ends with a small informal Mass, composed of
readings from Castro, Neruda, and Torres, followed by Eucharist,
Berrigan reveals more about the group and their beliefs than the
weightier philosophical sections are ever able to. It comes as no
surprise that Daniel Berrigan is a well known poet.
Yet his book does contain one major disappointment — an essay
written by Father Berrigan on civil disobedience. What promises to be
the book's highpoint turns out to be a confused, discursive exercise in
abstraction.
It is unfortunate that a man who so self-consciously regards himself
as a symbolic victim of corrupt society could not present a clearer
definition of his ideals.
Despite their faults, the books leave one with a strong sense of the
sincere idealism which both Philip and Daniel Berrigan possess.
When Daniel Berrigan tells a student that perhaps jail is "where all
Christians should be today," one is tempted to agree.

scenes.
Daniel Berrigan's description of a picnic with the other members of
the Catsonville Nine after their arrest is a prime example of this.
As the picnic ends with a small informal Mass, composed of
readings from Castro, Neruda, and Torres, followed by Eucharist,
Berrigan reveals more about the group and their beliefs than the
weightier philosophical sections are ever able to. It comes as no
surprise that Daniel Berrigan is a well known poet.
Yet his book does contain one major disappointment — an essay
written by Father Berrigan on civil disobedience. What promises to be
the book's highpoint turns out to be a confused, discursive exercise in
abstraction.
It is unfortunate that a man who so self-consciously regards himself
as a symbolic victim of corrupt society could not present a clearer
definition of his ideals.
Despite their faults, the books leave one with a strong sense of the
sincere idealism which both Philip and Daniel Berrigan possess.
When Daniel Berrigan tells a student that perhaps jail is "where all
Christians should be today," one is tempted to agree.

Along with almost every other Western institution that one can
think of, the Catholic Church is in one of the most difficult periods in its
200 year history. The Church is divided into two internal factions
which are battling for its soul.
One group wishes to continue the century-old practice of remaining
aloof from society, demanding that the world come to it. The other
group wants to change the fundament al direction of the Church and
bring it into an immediate relationship with its society.
This faction sees the Church as the greatest potential instrument of
social change available in the modern world. In America the
unchallanged leaders of this faction are two brothers, both of them
priests—Philip and Daniel Berrigan.
These two books deal with the public and private lives of this
remarkable pair. They both give ample evidence of the personal
powers of the two men who have led the battle to change the
American Catholic Church from an "Irish ghetto" into a revolutionary
institution.
They are very personal volumes. They deal with particular people
and not with the age. Yet the age is so well reflected in the lives and
thoughts of these men that such distinctions soon become
unimportant.
The journey through the lives of the Berrigans reads much like the
development of the mentality of the American Left over the past
decade.
Philip Berrigan, the first Catholic priest in the history of the United
States to serve time as a political prisoner, is shown here involved with

civil rights movements in the early sixties. We see why and how he
moves to his first conscious act of lawbreaking when he pours blood
over Baltimore draft records in 1967.
Even the meetings and conversations preceding the famous
Catsonville Nine raid in May, 1968 are given in detail.
And, when the judge says at the end of the trial that "the issues
affected him profoundly as a man but could not be raised before him
in his legal robes," we ask along with Berrigan what kind of a society
demands this division between humanity and law.
Yet these are not solely books about large issues. They deal with
living, breathing men, and their strength stems from this source. The
sections which come off the best in both books are the tiny personal
scenes.
