# Statement Opposing Institutional Political Views
## 
### 
We, the undersigned members ot the Academic Council,
oppose the taking of institutional positions by the University
or any official body thereof on matters not related directly
to the proper functioning of the University.
1
As we explain below, we believe that political expression by
the University is improper and harmful as a matter of policy.
Initially, however, we note that such expression by the
Academic Senate and Council and by academic departments
is not authorized by the rules of the University. The Articles
of Organization of the Faculty (June, 1967) limit the
Academic Council's authority to "the internal administration
of the University" (Ch. IV, Sec. 2(d)), and limit
departmental authority to the "direction of the work of
instruction in the department and .. . the internal
administration of the department (Ch. VIII, Sec. 2).
Nothing in the Articles of Organization colorably authorizes
either the Council or departments to express official views
about matters not directly connected with the University's
internal administration. Nor, of course, does the Senate
Charter give wider authority to that body.
II
Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political
positions. Simply put: it is no part of the proper business of
a University to express institutional views on most public
issues. Controversies over the formulation of institutional
expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the
expression of an institutional view is bound to be complex.
On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have
expertise greater than that of ordinary citizens. The processes
through which institutional statements on political matters
are considered and enacted are usually incompatible with the
University's commitment to rational inquiry and discourse.
And the rhetoric of the resulting statement inevitably
oversimplifies the issues involved-in precisely the manner
that honest scholarship is committed not to oversimplify.
More dangerously, the University's commitment to
particular political positions tends to create an institutional

orthodoxy which makes "heretics' of those who disagree,
and which is inconsistent with the University's fundamental
commitment to the continual critical search for truth in all
areas. Politicization is a force not easily contained: what
begins in the Academic Senate is bound ultimately to
manifest itself in the classroom, and in appointments and

Every university has been the object of attempts, both
internal and external, to impose orthodoxies in particular
matters. These pressures often have been from the right. But
orthodoxy is no less pernicious because its content is
"liberal." For the particular position that a university takes is
not nearly so self-destructive as the fact that it takes a

Chicago Law School has put it:
"The essence of the academy is disinterestedness. Its
justification is disinterestedness. An institution
cannot be both a political force and an institution
dedicated to the search for knowledge and its
dissemination. As a university makes a political
commitment, it destroys its claim to academic
freedom. And without academic freedom, the search
for and dissemination of knowledge becomes more
shadow than substance. If research begins with a
commitment to an answer, it should not be
surprising that the expected answer is forthcoming."
Similarly, Professor Kenneth Keniston of Yale University has
written:
"The main task of the university is to maintain a
climate in which, among other things, the critical
spirit can flourish. If the individual universities as
organizations were to align themselves officially with
specifically political positions, their ability to defend
the critical function would be undermined. Acting as
a lobby or pressure group for some particular
judgment or proposal, a university in effect closes its
doors to those whose critical sense leads them to
disagree."
In the long run, the University would cease to attract those
who disagreed with its official politics, thus discouraging the
open exchange of conflicting ideas that makes a university
deserve its name. But even in the short run, politicization of

the University through the institutional expression of views
will adversely affect the quality of the institution's life.
Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.
11l
Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.
IV
We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to
consider the questions raised in this document. It is
important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of
institutional views may be demanded. Global crises present
inauspicious occasions tor the thoughtful consideration of
matters of this sort.

Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.

Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.

We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to

important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of

We, the undersigned members ot the Academic Council,
oppose the taking of institutional positions by the University
or any official body thereof on matters not related directly
to the proper functioning of the University.
1
As we explain below, we believe that political expression by
the University is improper and harmful as a matter of policy.
Initially, however, we note that such expression by the
Academic Senate and Council and by academic departments
is not authorized by the rules of the University. The Articles
of Organization of the Faculty (June, 1967) limit the
Academic Council's authority to "the internal administration
of the University" (Ch. IV, Sec. 2(d)), and limit
departmental authority to the "direction of the work of
instruction in the department and .. . the internal
administration of the department (Ch. VIII, Sec. 2).
Nothing in the Articles of Organization colorably authorizes
either the Council or departments to express official views
about matters not directly connected with the University's
internal administration. Nor, of course, does the Senate
Charter give wider authority to that body.
II
Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political
positions. Simply put: it is no part of the proper business of
a University to express institutional views on most public
issues. Controversies over the formulation of institutional
expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the
expression of an institutional view is bound to be complex.
On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have
expertise greater than that of ordinary citizens. The processes
through which institutional statements on political matters
are considered and enacted are usually incompatible with the
University's commitment to rational inquiry and discourse.
And the rhetoric of the resulting statement inevitably
oversimplifies the issues involved-in precisely the manner
that honest scholarship is committed not to oversimplify.
More dangerously, the University's commitment to
particular political positions tends to create an institutional

orthodoxy which makes "heretics' of those who disagree,
and which is inconsistent with the University's fundamental
commitment to the continual critical search for truth in all
areas. Politicization is a force not easily contained: what
begins in the Academic Senate is bound ultimately to
manifest itself in the classroom, and in appointments and
promotions.
Every university has been the object of attempts, both
internal and external, to impose orthodoxies in particular
matters. These pressures often have been from the right. But
orthodoxy is no less pernicious because its content is
"liberal." For the particular position that a university takes is
not nearly so self-destructive as the fact that it takes a
position. As Professor Philip B. Kurland of the University of
Chicago Law School has put it:
"The essence of the academy is disinterestedness. Its
justification is disinterestedness. An institution
cannot be both a political force and an institution
dedicated to the search for knowledge and its
dissemination. As a university makes a political
commitment, it destroys its claim to academic
freedom. And without academic freedom, the search
for and dissemination of knowledge becomes more
shadow than substance. If research begins with a
commitment to an answer, it should not be
surprising that the expected answer is forthcoming."
Similarly, Professor Kenneth Keniston of Yale University has
written:
"The main task of the university is to maintain a
climate in which, among other things, the critical
spirit can flourish. If the individual universities as
organizations were to align themselves officially with
specifically political positions, their ability to defend
the critical function would be undermined. Acting as
a lobby or pressure group for some particular
judgment or proposal, a university in effect closes its
doors to those whose critical sense leads them to
disagree."
In the long run, the University would cease to attract those
who disagreed with its official politics, thus discouraging the
open exchange of conflicting ideas that makes a university
deserve its name. But even in the short run, politicization of

Academic Council's authority to "the internal administration

either the Council or departments to express official views

Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political

a University to express institutional views on most public
issues. Controversies over the formulation of institutional
expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the
expression of an institutional view is bound to be complex.
On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have
expertise greater than that of ordinary citizens. The processes
through which institutional statements on political matters
are considered and enacted are usually incompatible with the
University's commitment to rational inquiry and discourse.
And the rhetoric of the resulting statement inevitably
oversimplifies the issues involved-in precisely the manner
that honest scholarship is committed not to oversimplify.

particular political positions tends to create an institutional

the University through the institutional expression of views
will adversely affect the quality of the institution's life.
Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.
11l
Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.
IV
We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to
consider the questions raised in this document. It is
important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of
institutional views may be demanded. Global crises present
inauspicious occasions tor the thoughtful consideration of
matters of this sort.

Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.

Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.

We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to
consider the questions raised in this document. It is
important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of
institutional views may be demanded. Global crises present

We, the undersigned members ot the Academic Council,
oppose the taking of institutional positions by the University
or any official body thereof on matters not related directly
to the proper functioning of the University.
1
As we explain below, we believe that political expression by
the University is improper and harmful as a matter of policy.
Initially, however, we note that such expression by the
Academic Senate and Council and by academic departments
is not authorized by the rules of the University. The Articles
of Organization of the Faculty (June, 1967) limit the
Academic Council's authority to "the internal administration
of the University" (Ch. IV, Sec. 2(d)), and limit
departmental authority to the "direction of the work of
instruction in the department and .. . the internal
administration of the department (Ch. VIII, Sec. 2).
Nothing in the Articles of Organization colorably authorizes
either the Council or departments to express official views
about matters not directly connected with the University's
internal administration. Nor, of course, does the Senate
Charter give wider authority to that body.
II
Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political
positions. Simply put: it is no part of the proper business of
a University to express institutional views on most public
issues. Controversies over the formulation of institutional
expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the
expression of an institutional view is bound to be complex.
On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have
expertise greater than that of ordinary citizens. The processes
through which institutional statements on political matters
are considered and enacted are usually incompatible with the
University's commitment to rational inquiry and discourse.
And the rhetoric of the resulting statement inevitably
oversimplifies the issues involved-in precisely the manner
that honest scholarship is committed not to oversimplify.
More dangerously, the University's commitment to
particular political positions tends to create an institutional

orthodoxy which makes "heretics' of those who disagree,
and which is inconsistent with the University's fundamental
commitment to the continual critical search for truth in all
areas. Politicization is a force not easily contained: what
begins in the Academic Senate is bound ultimately to
manifest itself in the classroom, and in appointments and
promotions.
Every university has been the object of attempts, both
internal and external, to impose orthodoxies in particular
matters. These pressures often have been from the right. But
orthodoxy is no less pernicious because its content is
"liberal." For the particular position that a university takes is
not nearly so self-destructive as the fact that it takes a
position. As Professor Philip B. Kurland of the University of
Chicago Law School has put it:
"The essence of the academy is disinterestedness. Its
justification is disinterestedness. An institution
cannot be both a political force and an institution
dedicated to the search for knowledge and its
dissemination. As a university makes a political
commitment, it destroys its claim to academic
freedom. And without academic freedom, the search
for and dissemination of knowledge becomes more
shadow than substance. If research begins with a
commitment to an answer, it should not be
surprising that the expected answer is forthcoming."
Similarly, Professor Kenneth Keniston of Yale University has
written:
"The main task of the university is to maintain a
climate in which, among other things, the critical
spirit can flourish. If the individual universities as
organizations were to align themselves officially with
specifically political positions, their ability to defend
the critical function would be undermined. Acting as
a lobby or pressure group for some particular
judgment or proposal, a university in effect closes its
doors to those whose critical sense leads them to
disagree."
In the long run, the University would cease to attract those
who disagreed with its official politics, thus discouraging the
open exchange of conflicting ideas that makes a university
deserve its name. But even in the short run, politicization of

Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political

a University to express institutional views on most public

expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the

On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have

Every university has been the object of attempts, both

the University through the institutional expression of views
will adversely affect the quality of the institution's life.
Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.
11l
Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.
IV
We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to
consider the questions raised in this document. It is
important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of
institutional views may be demanded. Global crises present
inauspicious occasions tor the thoughtful consideration of
matters of this sort.

We, the undersigned members ot the Academic Council,
oppose the taking of institutional positions by the University
or any official body thereof on matters not related directly
to the proper functioning of the University.
1
As we explain below, we believe that political expression by
the University is improper and harmful as a matter of policy.
Initially, however, we note that such expression by the
Academic Senate and Council and by academic departments
is not authorized by the rules of the University. The Articles
of Organization of the Faculty (June, 1967) limit the
Academic Council's authority to "the internal administration
of the University" (Ch. IV, Sec. 2(d)), and limit
departmental authority to the "direction of the work of
instruction in the department and .. . the internal
administration of the department (Ch. VIII, Sec. 2).
Nothing in the Articles of Organization colorably authorizes
either the Council or departments to express official views
about matters not directly connected with the University's
internal administration. Nor, of course, does the Senate
Charter give wider authority to that body.
II
Independent of the question of legal authority, there exist
compelling reasons against the University's taking political
positions. Simply put: it is no part of the proper business of
a University to express institutional views on most public
issues. Controversies over the formulation of institutional
expressions, and the existence of the statements themselves,
detract seriously from the University's performance of its
core functions of disinterested scholarship and learning.
Any issue of sufficient concern to create a demand for the
expression of an institutional view is bound to be complex.
On many issues, only a small number of the faculty will have
expertise greater than that of ordinary citizens. The processes
through which institutional statements on political matters
are considered and enacted are usually incompatible with the
University's commitment to rational inquiry and discourse.
And the rhetoric of the resulting statement inevitably
oversimplifies the issues involved-in precisely the manner
that honest scholarship is committed not to oversimplify.

the University through the institutional expression of views
will adversely affect the quality of the institution's life.
Honest and intense argument about political issues is
essential to the intellectual vitality of the University. But
when the prize for winning an argument is power—even the
meager power of speaking "for" the University-honesty
tends to become compromised and argument becomes a
divisive force.
The Stanford faculty choose representatives to the
Academic Senate for their vision and capabilities in dealing
with internal University matters. If the passing of political
resolutions become a proper function of the Senate, it
becomes proper to consider the views of candidates—and of
prospective faculty members—on the kinds of external
political issues likely to come before the Senate. This would
seriously distort, and undermine, the University's internal
system of governance.
11l
Nothing we have said is intended to diminish the rights of
members of the University, acting individually or through
private groups and organizations, to participate actively in
public political affairs, so long as such participation is not
inconsistent with their academic obligations. (See "Freedom
and Responsibility," Nov. 5. 1970, Statement of the AAUP
Council.)
Nor do the arguments advanced above or the language of
the Articles of Organization of the Faculty forbid the taking
of institutional positions under all circumstances. They
require, however, that such positions be taken only in
response to policies (for example, legislation requiring
teachers or students to attest to beliefs, or requiring or
prohibiting particular kinds of courses or research) that have
a significant and direct impact on the University s
performance of its academic functions.
IV
We urge all members of the Academic Senate and Council to
consider the questions raised in this document. It is
important that they be discussed and resolved in advance of
any particular situation in which the expression of
institutional views may be demanded. Global crises present
inauspicious occasions tor the thoughtful consideration of
matters of this sort.
