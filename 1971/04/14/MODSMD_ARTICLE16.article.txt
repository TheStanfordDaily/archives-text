# ASSU Candidates Debate Issues
## 
### 
The two ASSU presidential slates, meeting last
night at KZSU for a last-minute debate prior to the
final balloting today and tomorrow strongly disagreed
on a full range of issues from political activism to
ASSU funding.
"We have nothing against participation in politics,"
stated Chris Hocker, "but ASSU President stands for
a particular point of view and to use ASSU money to
support that point of view is shafting someone. There
is a large minority not represented."
Both Hocker and Robin Friedman, candidates for
ASSU president and vice-president, expressed their
support of political activism outside the ASSU.
Friedman mentioned SCIP in particular as an outlet
for individual involvement. "The means are there (for
involvement) independent of the ASSU."
Larry Diamond, of the McHenry-Fields-Kim
ball-Diamond ticket, stated that students have
expressed their political opinion repeatedly during
ASSU elections in overwhelming numbers. He cited as
examples the removal of ROTC, the support for an
end to US involvement in Southeast Asia, and the
vote to end military recruitment on campus. The
McHenry ticket feels the student body is concerned
about political issues, and they intend to bring them
out in the open for discussion.
Hocker replied by criticizing the use of the word
"overwhelming," recalling that 2/3 of the student

body hadn't bothered to vote. "People don't care,"
he said. "There is tremendous apathy."
Diamond summed up the problem of apathy as a
"question of leadership." Election turnouts are small
because there is no leadership, people don't know
about the issues. The goal of the McHenry ticket is to
educate people on the issues.
Hocker feels people cannot be educated to be
activists. "You have no right to educate
anybody ... They can educate themselves."
As an example of how political activism in the
ASSU office can lead to misuse of funds, Hocker
cited the promise in the campaign leaflet of the
McHenry ticket to support the National Peace March
on April 24th with ASSU funds.
Peace Fund
Diamond replied that the promised funds would
come from a special ASSU Peace Fund which has
been set up for that specific purpose.
When questioned about his feelings towards the
National Peace March, Hocker answered, "I have no
plans to go to San Francisco on April 24th . . . The
ASSU cannot get the US out of Vietnam, nor can it
clean up pollution ..."
Confronted with the issue of $0 and the dilemma
of student services surviving without ASSU funds,
Hocker replied, "It's a test of a group's legitimacy,
ability to gather support. If they can't get it, they
don't deserve it."
Both sides were asked whether they represented
specific interest groups.
"If we represented solely the FCM, we would have
gotten 25 votes," replied Hocker.
"Diane and I are both members of the BSU,"
answered Doug McHenry, "but then it's not just
Diane and I. We all work as equals. We have black,
white, and women on our ticket."

been set up for that specific purpose.
When questioned about his feelings towards the
National Peace March, Hocker answered, "I have no
plans to go to San Francisco on April 24th . . . The
ASSU cannot get the US out of Vietnam, nor can it
clean up pollution ..."
Confronted with the issue of $0 and the dilemma
of student services surviving without ASSU funds,
Hocker replied, "It's a test of a group's legitimacy,
ability to gather support. If they can't get it, they
don't deserve it."
Both sides were asked whether they represented
specific interest groups.
"If we represented solely the FCM, we would have
gotten 25 votes," replied Hocker.
"Diane and I are both members of the BSU,"
answered Doug McHenry, "but then it's not just
Diane and I. We all work as equals. We have black,
white, and women on our ticket."
The two ASSU presidential slates, meeting last
night at KZSU for a last-minute debate prior to the
final balloting today and tomorrow strongly disagreed
on a full range of issues from political activism to
ASSU funding.
"We have nothing against participation in politics,"
stated Chris Hocker, "but ASSU President stands for
a particular point of view and to use ASSU money to
support that point of view is shafting someone. There
is a large minority not represented."
Both Hocker and Robin Friedman, candidates for
ASSU president and vice-president, expressed their
support of political activism outside the ASSU.
Friedman mentioned SCIP in particular as an outlet
for individual involvement. "The means are there (for
involvement) independent of the ASSU."
Larry Diamond, of the McHenry-Fields-Kim
ball-Diamond ticket, stated that students have
expressed their political opinion repeatedly during
ASSU elections in overwhelming numbers. He cited as
examples the removal of ROTC, the support for an
end to US involvement in Southeast Asia, and the
vote to end military recruitment on campus. The
McHenry ticket feels the student body is concerned
about political issues, and they intend to bring them
out in the open for discussion.
Hocker replied by criticizing the use of the word
"overwhelming," recalling that 2/3 of the student

body hadn't bothered to vote. "People don't care,"
he said. "There is tremendous apathy."
Diamond summed up the problem of apathy as a
"question of leadership." Election turnouts are small
because there is no leadership, people don't know
about the issues. The goal of the McHenry ticket is to
educate people on the issues.
Hocker feels people cannot be educated to be
activists. "You have no right to educate
anybody ... They can educate themselves."
As an example of how political activism in the
ASSU office can lead to misuse of funds, Hocker
cited the promise in the campaign leaflet of the
McHenry ticket to support the National Peace March
on April 24th with ASSU funds.
Peace Fund
Diamond replied that the promised funds would
come from a special ASSU Peace Fund which has
been set up for that specific purpose.
