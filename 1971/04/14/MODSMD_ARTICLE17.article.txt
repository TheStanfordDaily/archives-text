Packard Honored
WASHINGTON, D.C.—Three Stanford University
engineering professors and four engineering
alumni—including Deputy Defense Secretary David
Packard—have been elected to the National Academy of
Engineering, it was announced here Tuesday, April 13.
Profs. Rold Eliassen, John G. Linvill, and Hubert Heffner
were the faculty members honored. Membership in the
engineering academy is considered the highest professional
distinction that can be conferred upon an American
engineer.
Besides Packard, other Stanford alumni elected were Dr.
Roy Walter Gould, assistant director of the AEC's Research
Division; Dr. Thomas Lyle Martin Jr., dean of the Institute
of Technology at Southern Methodist University; and Dr.
Ronald Smelt, vice president and chief scientist of
Lockheed Aircraft Corp., Burbank.
Suit ("on lin lies
Dr. Nancy Cross and co-plaintiff Linda Grouse won the
right to a hearing on granting a preliminary injunction
pending a trial regarding their complaint of sex
discrimination at Stanford.
In a private hearing Tuesday afternoon, Judge Richard
W. Rhodes, presiding judge of the North Santa Clara
County Superior Court arranged for a visiting
out-of-county judge to hear the case Thursday morning at
9:30 a.m. in Department 1 at the County Courthouse.
Representing the named Stanford defendants were
attorney Iris Brest of the General Office staff and David
Heilbron of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enerson, a San
Francisco law firm. As noted in Dr. Cross's complaint, two
members of Heilbron's firm, Brown and Doyle, are Board
of Trustee members.

Dr. Cross hoped for a "prompt resolution in the interest
of the University." Her initial motion for a temporary
restraining order against Stanford was dismissed by Judge
Rhodes. Because Dr. Cross was unable to arrange an earlier
hearing, the University sent out all acceptances to high
school students as planned.
Dr. Cross is basing her case for the granting of the
preliminary injunction on the obligation to impress trusts
arising from the Stanford and McCormick Trusts.
Tonight Dr. Cross and Linda Crouse will voice their
views on "The Case of Sex-Race Equality in Admissions
and Employment at Stanford" at 7:30 p.m. on KZSU.
Hospital-TlVlir Link
Last weekend's battle at the Stanford Hospital was
linked to the continuing boycott of Tresidder Union by
noon-hour speakers on the Union patio Monday.
Representatives of Venceremos, the United Stanford
Employees, and the Black Student Union told lunch time
customers that students, workers, and members of minority
groups must organize and take action against the
"imperialism" of the university administration.
Geraldine Foote of Venceremos stressed the necessity of
"action of any level — including groups of two or three at
night." She said that the university administration was
"running scared;" and that the days ahead were crucial to
the success or failure of the radical movement.
A representative of the Black Student Union detailed the
events of the hospital sit-in which culminated in a battle
with police on Friday night. She claimed that black
demonstrators at the hospital were treated far more harshly
by police officers than were whites arrested in February's
disorders on the campus. "The police tried to kill us," she
said.
