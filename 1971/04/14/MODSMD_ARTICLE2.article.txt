# National Attention On 'Daily' Raid
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
The police raid of Daily offices Monday raised
widespread reaction yesterday including coverage in
many major newspapers and the nationwide CBS
evening news. Said Walter Cronkite, "With our bill of
rights, guaranteeing freedom of the press, this (the
search of the Daily sounds like a question for some
remote totalitarian state." Assistant District Attorney
Craig Brown revealed that the search was caused in
part by the belief of his office that the Daily policy
about incriminating evidence was designed to
"protect criminals."
Brown also said that if his office had felt the Daily
policy to be comparable to that of other newspapers
the search would not have happened.
Editor Felicity Barringer responded, "Mr. Brown
could not have looked very closely to our stated
editorial policy which is indeed very similar to that of
the Palo Alto Times. We will print any picture we feel
is newsworthy regardless of the possibility of its being
incrimination."
Comparable Policy
The Daily policy of destroying incriminating film
not published compares with that of the Palo Alto
Times which destroys all film not published.
The reasoning behind the two policies is similar.
According to Barringer, "Since there are no legal
safeguards to protect the press against such raids, we

have adopted this policy to best insure our ability to
cover the news. "If any person making news feels he
can be later incriminated by the presence of a Daily
photographer, our ability to cover events relating to
him is severely hampered."
Bodi explained the Times policy as follows:
"In both prosecution and defense there has been a
growing tendency to use both pictures and notes to
try and defend their case... In the case of
photographers it not only hampers their ability to
report, but puts them in danger. If pictures are not
used by the paper, but by the prosecution to get
convictions, the next time the photographer appears
at one of these events, he is sure to get clobbered."
Items of Value
Palo Alto police Chief James Zurcher told the
Daily the action was based on information that
perhaps the Daily was in possession of certain items
which may be of some evidenciary value to the
district attorney's office for criminal prosecution. In
addition, he said, "We are using the system as it was
intended to be used ... We certainly wouldn't want
to scare you."
President Richard Lyman complained yesterday
that he had not been advised in advance of the action,
and that if he had been he would have advised against
it.
Zurcher contended that the Stanford police had

been informed well in advance, but Stanford Chief
Thomas Bell denied this. According to Bell, he was
notified in advance that the Palo Alto police were in
the process of getting a search warrant and was asked
to provide a key to the office. He was not told,
however, of the actual operation until officers were
already in the process of searching the newspaper's
offices.
Bell also said that the Stanford police would not
take part in any search of this kind. The Stanford
police officers involved in covering the action were
not told in advance what the duty entailed, and did
not participate in the search itself.
Because Stanford lands are unincorporated, Santa
Clara County Sheriffs would normally be informed of
the action withholding their jurisdiction. In this case,
however, according the Sheriff James Geary, "We had
nothing to do with it, and knew nothing about
it... I do not know why we were not
contacted ... we like to think it was an oversight."
After obtaming preliminary legal advice the Daily
is considering two kinds of protection from further
such actions. One, injunctive relief is a process that
theDaily could use to ask the courts to enjoin police
from searching its offices. The other, declaratory
relief, is less powerful in that it declares that the
action violates First Amendment guarantees of
freedom of the press, but does not directly prevent a
similar occurance.

THE BIG TIME—DAILY editor-in-chief Felicity Barringer was beseiged all day
yesterday by reporters and camera crews, all interested in investigating the police
search of the DAILY offices Monday afternoon. Filmed reports of the incident hit
the evening news programs in San Francisco and Sacramento as well as going out
nationally over Walter Cronkite's CBS program. It is the first known police search
of a newspaper office for evidence.
The police raid of Daily offices Monday raised
widespread reaction yesterday including coverage in
many major newspapers and the nationwide CBS
evening news. Said Walter Cronkite, "With our bill of
rights, guaranteeing freedom of the press, this (the
search of the Daily sounds like a question for some
remote totalitarian state." Assistant District Attorney
Craig Brown revealed that the search was caused in
part by the belief of his office that the Daily policy
about incriminating evidence was designed to
"protect criminals."
Brown also said that if his office had felt the Daily
policy to be comparable to that of other newspapers
the search would not have happened.
Editor Felicity Barringer responded, "Mr. Brown
could not have looked very closely to our stated
editorial policy which is indeed very similar to that of
the Palo Alto Times. We will print any picture we feel
is newsworthy regardless of the possibility of its being
incrimination."
Comparable Policy
The Daily policy of destroying incriminating film
not published compares with that of the Palo Alto
Times which destroys all film not published.
The reasoning behind the two policies is similar.
According to Barringer, "Since there are no legal
safeguards to protect the press against such raids, we

have adopted this policy to best insure our ability to
cover the news. "If any person making news feels he
can be later incriminated by the presence of a Daily
photographer, our ability to cover events relating to
him is severely hampered."
Bodi explained the Times policy as follows:
"In both prosecution and defense there has been a
growing tendency to use both pictures and notes to
try and defend their case... In the case of
photographers it not only hampers their ability to
report, but puts them in danger. If pictures are not
used by the paper, but by the prosecution to get
convictions, the next time the photographer appears
at one of these events, he is sure to get clobbered."
Items of Value
Palo Alto police Chief James Zurcher told the
Daily the action was based on information that
perhaps the Daily was in possession of certain items
which may be of some evidenciary value to the
district attorney's office for criminal prosecution. In
addition, he said, "We are using the system as it was
intended to be used ... We certainly wouldn't want
to scare you."
President Richard Lyman complained yesterday
that he had not been advised in advance of the action,
and that if he had been he would have advised against
it.
Zurcher contended that the Stanford police had

been informed well in advance, but Stanford Chief
Thomas Bell denied this. According to Bell, he was
notified in advance that the Palo Alto police were in
the process of getting a search warrant and was asked
to provide a key to the office. He was not told,
however, of the actual operation until officers were
already in the process of searching the newspaper's
offices.
Bell also said that the Stanford police would not
take part in any search of this kind. The Stanford
police officers involved in covering the action were
not told in advance what the duty entailed, and did
not participate in the search itself.
Because Stanford lands are unincorporated, Santa
Clara County Sheriffs would normally be informed of
the action withholding their jurisdiction. In this case,
however, according the Sheriff James Geary, "We had
nothing to do with it, and knew nothing about
it... I do not know why we were not
contacted ... we like to think it was an oversight."
After obtaming preliminary legal advice the Daily
is considering two kinds of protection from further
such actions. One, injunctive relief is a process that
theDaily could use to ask the courts to enjoin police
from searching its offices. The other, declaratory
relief, is less powerful in that it declares that the
action violates First Amendment guarantees of
freedom of the press, but does not directly prevent a
similar occurance.
