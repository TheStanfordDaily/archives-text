# TMU Theft, Beating
## 
### JON DEDMON FRED MANN 
Attacks on at least three members of
the Free Campus Movement (FCM)
followed an eat-in at Tresidder Union
yesterday at which some 30 blacks
carrying trays loaded with food, walked
out of the cafeteria without paying.
The attacks came after the blacks
had noticed six FCMers, watching them
from the second deck of TMU as they
ate below. One of the six, Steven
Guerra, was taking pictures of the
group.
Members of the black group then
pursued the six around the Union's top
deck, past the ASSU office, and into
the Tresidder parking lot where one
person was caught, tackled and kicked.
The group then chased three of the
FCM members, among them the
organization's chairman Ray White and
Guerra to a lawn at the corner of
Salvatierra and Campus Drive. There
White and Guerra were knocked to the
ground and Guerra kicked. His camera
was taken and his film exposed.
Switch Directions
Now numbering near 20, the group
turned and headed toward the Post
Office. FCMer Ed Jagels, returning
from calling the police, was spotted and
chased across the street where he too

was knocked down and kicked a
number of times by two or three
members of the group.
The eat-in group then proceeded to
Engineering Corner where MECHA was
holding a rally for the rehiring of Dr.
Jose Aguilar, the Chicano neurosurgeon
recently not reappointed by the Med
School.
Members of the FCM group included
White, Jagels, Guerra, and Robert
FitzSimmons.
'They Shot First'
Jagels claimed last night that two of
those eating the stolen food first
spotted the FCM group on the terrace
above, and took pictures of them.
Guerra then took their pictures in
return, he said. He further placed the
damage to Guerra's camera taken
during the Tight, at $100. He could not
identify any of the assailants.
The eat-in had begun at 12:50 p.m.
Tresidder Director Forrest Tregea
estimated the value of the food taken
to be near $100.
The meal lasted 10 minutes. At that
time several members of the group took
their trays with plates, glasses and
silverware, and deposited them in
nearby trash receptacles.
It was at this point that
photographers were spotted and the
chase began.
