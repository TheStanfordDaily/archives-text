## New Demands Issued 
### D. LAWRENCE SPECTOR 
A composite set of demands,
formulated by black Medical Center
workers, students, doctors and the
Alianza Latina representing all Latin
workers, will be presented to President
Lyman early this morning. No date for
compliance with them has been
released.
The eight non-negotiable demands,
presented on Monday by the Black
Advisory Committee to Dr. John
Wilson, acting dean of the Medical
Center, were planned to be resolved by
the Medical Center administration at
9:00 a.m. today.
The BAC and Alianza Latina were in
continuous session yesterday in order
to formulate a united group of
demands. Dr. Wilson and Dr. Gonda
met with faculty and administrators -
including Provost Miller to determine
the response to the eight demands.
Queries as to what was resolved met
with "no comment."
The Medical School Faculty Senate,
after two days of discussion, passed a
resolution yesterday in which it
"expresses deep concern when
circumstances exist wherein grievances
of Hospital and Medical School workers
are not peaceably resolved. It is tragic

when an unresolved conflict results in
violent confrontation and we deplore
the fact that recent events escalated
beyond control of the internal Stanford
community and resulted in the use of
police force."
A teach-in for blacks, sponsored by
the BAC, is scheduled for 9:00 a.m. on
the Medical School lawn. A noon rally
at the same place is also on tap as
blacks and latins in the Medical School
have asked the white community to get
itself together and support an end to
racism.
