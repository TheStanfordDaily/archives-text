# Police Station Firebombed
## 
### 
Two unknown men threw three
molotov cocktails at the Stanford
police department offices on
Campus Drive early this morning,
causing a small fire which was
quickly extinguished.
One of the firebombs was thrown
through the back window of a police
car, and another struck a wall on the
north side of the station. The
location of the third could not be
immediately determined.
There were no injuries reported.
Two Stanford police officers,
patrolmen Welch and Screws, were
leaving the front door of the offices
at the time the last firebomb was
thrown, and have stated that they
could probably identify the two
suspects they observed.
