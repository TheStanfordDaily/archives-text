# Aguilar Resolution Ratified By Senate
## 
### DEAD JONMAN 
The student senate voted last night
to transfer all money out of the ASSU
reserve fund, and called for the rehiring
of Dr. Antonio Aguilar and Sam
Bridges, focal points of recent Medical
School controversies. They also
condemned the police tactics used last
Friday to break up the sit-in at the Med
Center stemming from the Bridges case.
During the brief 45-minute meeting,
the Senate passed a bill transfering
$5,000 from the ASSU Underwriting
Reserve fund to the ASSU bail fund,
until requested back by the reserve
fund.
It also passed a bill sponsored by
former ASSU speaker Yale Braunstein
which transfer the remaining money in
the reserve fund to the ASSU
Contingency fund.
However, following the meeting,
Council of Presidents member Pat C.
Shea vetoed both bills so that a
majority of all senators, 21 is now
required to override Shea's veto.
The transfering of funds from the
Underwriting Reserve fund by the
Senate in the two bills raises some
interesting legal questions following last
week's election in which a measure was
passed stating that "No monies shall be
disbursed or transfered from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve without the
approval of a majority of the members
in the Association voting in a general
election."
Senate Parliamentarian Herbie
Borock maintains however, that since
those elections have not yet been
validated by the Senate, the election,
and hence the measure, is not official.
Shea, however, said that
Vice-president Bob C.rant met last night
with Election Commissioner Louis
Humphreys and that they certified the
election so that according to ASSU
by-laws, the election results were
official.
'Senate Unrepresentative'
Shea, in his veto of the bills said that
"These bills again provide conclusive
proof that the ASSU Senate refuses to
represent the student body and would
even steal student funds to satiate the
needs of the power blocs that control
the Senate."
Hal Mickelson, another council

member, called the transfers of money
a "rip-off" and said in a statement,
"Last week, students voted by a clear
majority for an initiative measure
protecting ASSU finances from the
student Senate. At the Senate's meeting
tonight, it became clear that the Senate
will disregard or subvert that student
vote."
The Senate also passed a resolution
asking the University to seek an
injunction in federal court against
further police searches of the Stanford
Daily.
