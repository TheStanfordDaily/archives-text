# Trustees Accept Austerity Budget, Establish Investment Guidelines
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Adoption of an austerity budget for
1971-72 and a resolution on investment
responsibility, establishing general
guidelines for considering possible
social, economic and political
implications of University monies, were
adopted by the Board of Trustees at
their meeting Tuesday.
Saving of $1,264,000 will be realized
by the second phase of the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP), designed
to slow the rate of increase in
expenditures and bring them in line
with expected income. Highlighting the
budget will be a seven percent increase
in basic room and board rates, a change
to $1295 from $1210, effective this
fall. The rate hike accompanies a
tuition increase to $2610 from $2400,
also effective next fall. Both are subject
to future increases on an annual basis.
Selected cutting resulted in savings in
instruction and departmental research
of $680,000; libraries, $72,000;
student aid, $130,000 (to be offset by
part-time jobs and expected increase in
scholarship support); student services,
$130,000, and administrative and
service departments, $252,000.
Two major budget increases were
established first, a University Progress
Fund and a Research Development
Fund of $200,000 each, as "seen"
money for new directions in teaching;
next, $320,000 will be added to

police and fire protection, including
added manpower and a new emergency
communications system.
The Trustees also ruled that
"independent consideration and
weight" will be given University
investments where "the undesirable
social, economic, and political acts of
the company involved are direct and
substantial," where "substantial
consensus" exists in the University
community on those acts, and where
"the economic costs to the University
of taking action are commensurate with
the probable effects of that action."
Although "achieving the maximum
return consistent with the appropriate
degree of risk" will remain dominant in

investment as well as voting stock
proxies, the Trustee Committee on
Investments will "give particular
attention to issues which fall . . . within
the guidelines." The Committee
emphasized that in most cases, the
University is a "small" stockholder
with very little direct leverage on the
companies' behavior.
The ad hoc trustee committee was
composed of scholars, attorneys,
businessmen, and young Stanford
graduates. Among members were
business economist Prof. G.L. Bach;
Denis Hayes, national coordinator of
Ecology Action; and William Hewlett,
chief executive officer of
Hewlett-Packard Co.
