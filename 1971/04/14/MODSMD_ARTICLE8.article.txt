The Sam Bridges case has, over the past three weeks,
jumped from obscurity into the limelight. In that time, the
events stemming from it have tended to overshadow the
original issue of his dismissal. Following a violent sit-in,
other disturbances, and rallies, it is time to return to that
original issue, and consider what should be done.
We feel that Mr. Bridges should be reinstated
immediately. He should also be given back pay, pending the
outcome of a grievance hearing. That hearing should be held
on the highest level in the hospital, bypassing intermediate
stages of the grievances procedures.
Such a hearing has become essential. A great deal of new
information about the case has come to light in recent days,
information that brings the original dismissal into serious
question. The words he allegedly exchanged with a hospital
guard now appear to have been minor. The question of his
loafing on the job remains unsettled. A complaint by a
fellow worker now appears to have been based on hearsay.
Thus, the reasons originally given for Sam Bridges' dismissal
are now open to serious doubt.
The argument has been made that a past decision should
not be countermanded under duress. The answer to this
point, however, is that the decision on Bridges was evidently
based on false assumptions on the part of his immediate
superiors, and on misleading and unverified facts. It would
be grossly unfair to make someone suffer the consequences
of such a decision until proof of its validity is shown.
Grievance procedures were evidently explained poorly, if at

ail, to Bridges. Other circumstances indicate that he may
have been discriminated against for having political
discussions with other workers. In light of all these factors,
the burden of proof should not rest with him to exonerate
himself of the charges, but with the hospital administration
to prove them. Until they do, Bridges' should not have to
suffer for the original, apparently faulty decision.
If Bridges is indeed reinstated, and if grievance
procedures are requested by him or any other worker in the
future, these procedures and all those party to them must
not be intimidated. The fact that one hospital administrator
and his family spent a night this weekend in a local motel as
death threats had been phoned to their house is enough
indication that su c h intimidation has existed. If
it is repeated in this or other proceedings, the whole
structure for arbitration, which now embodies rights
demanded in the sit-in, will be jeapordized.
It is also imperative to remember that the health and
perhaps the lives of sick people-the people for whose service
the hospital exists - could be jeapordized by such action as a
strike. This consideration is no doubt present in the minds
of both parties in this dispute, it must remain so. It would
only worsen the situation for the workers to strike over a
refusal to comply with an unfair demand, or for the hospital
administration to refuse to accede to a valid one - such as
the rehiring of Bridges - and the health of sick people might
be endangered. We urge all those involved in this
confrontation to continue to remember the patient - the
most vulnerable pawn of this dispute.
