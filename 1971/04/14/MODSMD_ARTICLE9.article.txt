police action
Editor, THE DAILY:
The University News Service
quotes Pres. Lyman an the
aftermath of the violence at the
hospital as follows: that people
who come in from the outside
and dod not have to remain when
the drama is over "inevitably are
less responsible" than people who
are part of the campus
community. This does not mean
that "people who are part of the
University are any better," just
that they are more familiar with
its ways and its environment.
Among the outside groups to
which this applies is the outside
police.
If Pres. Lyman suffers less from
that sadly telescoped perspective
that he perceives in protesters,
shouldn't he look for a long-run
alternative to the continual use of
that irresponsible outside group?
Shouldn't he begin now to create
for this University an indigenous
police force capable of dealing
with sit-in and riot situations, and
of doing so with a sense of
responsibility?

Quite possibly, no police action
was necessary in the hospital
situation. But assuming that in
some small number of future
situations major police action will
be necessary, shouldn't there be
available trained "people who are
part of the University" to do the
job humanely?

wise counsel
Editor, THE DAILY:
The 13 April Daily reports that
Prof. St. Clair Drake has registered
his disapproval of police action at
the Hospital last week by
resigning from the Committee of
Fifteen before the end of his two
year term in August. It is
unfortunate that so significant a
gesture should be aimed at the
committee of faculty, student,
and administration representatives
charged with proposing
amendments to the Legislative
and Judicial Charter by which
Stanford seeks to minimize use of
outside authorities as curbs on
disruption.

In these difficult times, the
wise counsel that Professor Drake
might have given will be sorely
missed by the Committee, as it
has been at all nine of this year's
meeting, and 10 of the 17
meetings called last year.
F.W. Crawford, Chairman
Committee of Fifteen
