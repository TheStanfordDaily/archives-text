# 11 New Demands Issued
## 
### D.L. SPECTOR 
Mr. James Cheatham, on behalf of
the Stanford Employees Coalition,
presented a list of 11 demands to
Provost William Miller yesterday
afternoon.
Miller, visable nervous, accepted the
demands at the conclusion of a noon
rally on the Medical School lawn,
watched over by police on the Medical
School roof. Cheatham announced a
9:00 a.m. Monday deadline for
resolvance of the demands.
Miller read the demands over the
microphone after being requested to do
so by the crowd. He said he hoped to
"start discussions with the Black and
Latin committees" and then left with
Associate Provost Rosenzwieg.
The Stanford Employees Coalition,
composed of black, brown, and white
workers, medical students, faculty and
staff, released the demands after a two
and a half hour caucus yesterday
morning. These are a united list which
supersedes the eight non-negotiable
demands issued Monday by the BAC
which had a deadline of 9:00 a.m.
yesterday.
The composite demands are as
follows:
1. All charges related to all persons
who were arrested in connection with
the demonstration held at Stanford
University Hospital April 9, 1971 be
dropped. Notwithstanding, all legal fees
incurred during this demonstration
shall be paid in full by Stanford
University.
2. Any persons who received any
form of injury because of their direct
involvement in the demonstration
should have medical expenses paid in
full by Stanford University.
3. Sam Bridges shall be reinstated
and reimbursed retroactively from date
of termination.
4.a. Dr. John L. Wilson resign as
Acting Dean; b. Frank Vitale, Deputy
Director of the Hospital, be relieved of
all Medical Center duties; c. Warren
Thorpe, Assistant Chief of Engineering,
be relieved of all Medical Center duties;
d. Black and Latin Committee must
approve those persons hired as
replacements in a, b, and c as well as
the new vacant Chief Engineer position.
5. Dr. Jose Aguilar be granted
tenure.
6. The Black and Latin Committee
be empowered to investigate and
evaluate policies, practices and
procedures of all departments in the
Medical Center. The first priorities of

the committee shall be the
development and implementation of
the Affirmative Action Program and
evaluation of the Personnel
Department.
7. That four voting places be filled
by Black and Latin delegates added to
the Administrative Council of the
Hospital.
8. Any employee who has to take a
leave for an acceptable and legitimate
reason, should have the right to do so.
Starting with the first day of leave, he
should be granted leave time up to six
months. The job should be left open
for the employee when leave is
terminated. This agreement shall be
reduced succinctly to writing.
9. Housekeeping assistants should be

at liberty to use any restroom
designated for Stanford Hospital
Employees.
10. Stanford's employee's medical
coverage should also include coverage
for the employee's spouse.
11. Each job should be clearly
classified, as well as, described. Further,
each job salary should be stated in
writing.
At the rally attended by 450 people,
Paul Williams, the sole minority student
in the Medical School class of '73,
explained the "reason I came here is to
take care of the people the
administration whipped last
Friday . . . Sam is a symbol of what is
going on here in the housekeeping
department, but he didn't go quietly'.'
