# Walk For Mankind Starts Saturday
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
A Walk For Mankind with a
projected goal of raising $15 ,00 0
for the Project Concern
Reconstructive Surgery Program
at Stanford is scheduled for
Saturday April 17. The money
received from the Palo Alto
community v\alk will be used for
expenses incurred treating 5 0
seriously deformed children from
Mexico and Latin America at
Stanford next year.
Although Stanford plastic
surgeons waive the usual
professional fee and operate
without charge, hospitalization
and intensive care costs have
accounted for the $300 average
expenditure on each of the 4 8
patients brought to Stanford in
the past. Most of the patients have
been children disfigured and
handicapped by cleft lips and
palates or hands without the
normal, five-finger separations,
but burn scars and other
deformaties are also treated.
Project Concern, a
no n- political, international
medical relief organization, is
sponsoring the walk.
Sponsors
Those students and Stanford
community members wishing to
participate in the walk may obtain
sponsor sheets and instructions
from the Project Concern table in
White Plaza or at Columbae
House. Prior to beginning the
walk between 7 a.m. and noon at
Maples Pavilion, each walker will
contact sponsors, people pledging
a specific amount of money to the
walker for every mile traversed.
After completing all or a
portion of the 18 mile route, each
walker collects the agreed-upon
amount from sponsors and

deposits the funds with local walk
personnel.
Comfortable Shoes
It is suggested that anyone
planning to make the walk wear
comfortable shoes. Five to six
hours may be necessary to
complete the course at a leisurely
pace. Official cars will be available
to return those who drop out
before the end.
Ten days ago Dr. Donald Laub,
Chief of Plastic Surgery at
Stanford Medical School, and a
team of associates performed 1 4
corrective operations in Baja
California. When it is possible to
remedy congenital defects of
needy persons while they live at
home, the cost of medical care is
reduced to between $ 4 0 and $ 10 0
for each operation. However,
while in Mexico, the surgeons
found that an additional four
children will have to be brought
to Stanford in the future because
of necessary extensive
rehabilitation.
Foster Parents Needed
Foster parents (preferably
Spanish speaking) are being
sought to care for children who
will be brought to Stanford next
year. The young patients are
assimilated into local family life
prior to their operations to allow
for a period of adjustment and

remain near Stanford for some
post-operative treatment.
Mr. Gary Miller, Regional
Director of Project Concern,
pointed out that these operations
would cost between $3,000 and
$5,000 without the donated
services and equipment and
cooperation of doctors from
many parts oT the world.
'Freaks' Ostracized
Mr. Miller said the Mexican
people have expressed particular
gratitude for corrective surgery's
radical and immediate benefits to
the child or adult stigmatized bv a

birth defect or other
disfigurement. He cited the lasting
effect of transforming an
ostracized "freak" who was
compelled to wear a bag over his
head in public into a handsome
child capable of living a normal,
social life.
Project Concern staffs and
supplies clinics in Appalachia,
Vietnam, Mexico and Hong Kong
and operates mobile medical and
dental clinics in New Mexico to
aid Navajo Indians. When funding
becomes available, there are plans
to open a drug therapy-counciling
center in California.
