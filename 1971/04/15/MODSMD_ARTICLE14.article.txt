Muskie Blast» FBI
WASHINGTCN—Sen. Edmund S. Muskie broadened
Congressional criticism of the FBI yesterday by accusing it
of massive spying of 40 to 60 of last April's Earth Day
anti-pollution observances.
"If anti-pollution rallies are a subject of intelligence
concern," the Maine Democrate said in the Senate speech,
"is anything immune?"
He said "there is no justification for any part of the
federal intelligence community surreptitiously observing
and reporting on legitimate political events which do not
effect our national security or which do not involve a
potential crime."
Muskie said neither Nixon nor Attorney Gen. John N.
Mitchell "will do anything to change this situation" adding
that "the President, in the face of reports of investigations
that should outrage the nation, remains silent."
