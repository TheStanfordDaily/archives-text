# Burbank Protests
## Coed, Minority Dorms Increase 
### FRANK MILLER 
Coed living groups and minority program houses will be
increased for undergraduates next year, according to a
Dean of Students Office housing report released today.
A guide to the residence draw for 1971-72 that will be
available in all dormitories tomorrow lists two residences
that are currently single sex as scheduled to become coed
next year—Burbank and Faisan (Florence Moore).
At the same time, the minority housing program will be
expanded to include a house in Wilbur with a concentration
of up to 40 percent Asian-Americans and two houses in
Florence Moore with a concentration of up to 50 percent
American Indians in each.
The black minority housing program currently located in
Soto and Junipero in Wilbur, will be moved to Roble Hall,
currently the Chicano theme house. Roble will have a
concentration of up to 30 percent blacks.
Chicanos who request next year to live in concentration
houses will live in Muir and Burbank (Stern) coed houses, a
concentration of up to 50 percent Chicanos.
Junipero Asian-American
Junipero House will be a coed house with an
Asian-American theme and Loro and Mirlo will be the
American Indian houses.
For the first time six currently independent living
groups, ZAP, ATO, Lambda Nu, Columbae, Jordan Coop,
and the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity will be included in the
draw. (An article in tomorrow's paper will explain these
changes.)
The decision to make Burbank a Chicano theme house
has drawn criticism from a group of current residents of the
all male dorm.
Some residents claim that the decision to make Burbank
a theme house was done "without consultation with any

members of Burbank," according to House President Roger
Hill.
"We would like to give coed living a try without any
theme," he continued. The group fears that if the house has
a theme next year, "the identity of Burbank would be
destroyed—its diversity and lack of any populated force."
Larry Horton, assistant dean of students in charge of the
undergraduate housing configuration, defends the choice of
Burbank for the Chicano program. He explains that since
the University is committed to minority housing, there is
"no other place where we could logically place two
houses. . . which would not create more problems" than
making one of them Burbank.
He explains that by "all evidence" Burbank is one of the
weakest dorms at Stanford. In last year's draw, only 22
students chose Burbank as their first or second choice when
Burbank had 65 spaces available. He added that there are
currently about 15 vacancies in the dormitory.
The Burbank group feels that the main reason Burbank
has been an unpopular place to live in the past is because it
has been all male. Now, however, residents claim to have 50
signatures of people who would commit themselves to
Burbank as their first choice in the housing draw for next
year provided the house is coed without any theme.
The Burbank group is negotiating with the Dean of
Student's office now although Horton is doubtful the
decision will be changed.
Horton feels that since the program of the dormitory is
being changed next year by making it coed, it is logical to
make any other change at the same time. He claims he had
knowledge of the arguments against making Burbank a
Chicano theme house and says that he had talked to staff
about Burbank and possibilities about next year before any
decision was made. "It was not a pleasant choice, but the
wisest choice for the University and all the students," he
said.

the University is committed to minority housing, there is
"no other place where we could logically place two
houses. . . which would not create more problems" than
making one of them Burbank.
He explains that by "all evidence" Burbank is one of the
weakest dorms at Stanford. In last year's draw, only 22
students chose Burbank as their first or second choice when
Burbank had 65 spaces available. He added that there are
currently about 15 vacancies in the dormitory.
The Burbank group feels that the main reason Burbank
has been an unpopular place to live in the past is because it
has been all male. Now, however, residents claim to have 50
signatures of people who would commit themselves to
Burbank as their first choice in the housing draw for next
year provided the house is coed without any theme.
The Burbank group is negotiating with the Dean of
Student's office now although Horton is doubtful the
decision will be changed.
Horton feels that since the program of the dormitory is
being changed next year by making it coed, it is logical to
make any other change at the same time. He claims he had
knowledge of the arguments against making Burbank a
Chicano theme house and says that he had talked to staff
about Burbank and possibilities about next year before any
decision was made. "It was not a pleasant choice, but the
wisest choice for the University and all the students," he
said.
Coed living groups and minority program houses will be
increased for undergraduates next year, according to a
Dean of Students Office housing report released today.
A guide to the residence draw for 1971-72 that will be
available in all dormitories tomorrow lists two residences
that are currently single sex as scheduled to become coed
next year—Burbank and Faisan (Florence Moore).
At the same time, the minority housing program will be
expanded to include a house in Wilbur with a concentration
of up to 40 percent Asian-Americans and two houses in
Florence Moore with a concentration of up to 50 percent
American Indians in each.
The black minority housing program currently located in
Soto and Junipero in Wilbur, will be moved to Roble Hall,
currently the Chicano theme house. Roble will have a
concentration of up to 30 percent blacks.
Chicanos who request next year to live in concentration
houses will live in Muir and Burbank (Stern) coed houses, a
concentration of up to 50 percent Chicanos.
Junipero Asian-American
Junipero House will be a coed house with an
Asian-American theme and Loro and Mirlo will be the
American Indian houses.
For the first time six currently independent living
groups, ZAP, ATO, Lambda Nu, Columbae, Jordan Coop,
and the Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity will be included in the
draw. (An article in tomorrow's paper will explain these
changes.)
The decision to make Burbank a Chicano theme house
has drawn criticism from a group of current residents of the
all male dorm.
Some residents claim that the decision to make Burbank
a theme house was done "without consultation with any

members of Burbank," according to House President Roger
Hill.
"We would like to give coed living a try without any
theme," he continued. The group fears that if the house has
a theme next year, "the identity of Burbank would be
destroyed—its diversity and lack of any populated force."
Larry Horton, assistant dean of students in charge of the
undergraduate housing configuration, defends the choice of
Burbank for the Chicano program. He explains that since
the University is committed to minority housing, there is
"no other place where we could logically place two
houses. . . which would not create more problems" than
