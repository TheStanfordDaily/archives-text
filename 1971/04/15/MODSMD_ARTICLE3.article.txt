# New Selection Policy
## Sponsors Denounce Plan 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Dormitory sponsors have recently
denounced a new dorm staffing plan as
"bureaucratic and hierarchical." They
claim the administration has
"dismantled one source of student
innovation and influence" by taking
away the sponsors' power to pick their
successors.
The Dean of Student's Office, which
is implementing the new procedures,
defends the changes as guaranteeing a
fair selection of the staff and
promoting a "team approach" to dorm
operation. More than 10 sponsors,
upperclass undergraduates who live in
dorms to advise other students, have
opposed dorm reorganization plans
drawn up by the Ad Hoc Committee on
Residential Education. The ten say
they represent virtually all 49
sponsoring the issue.
For several years, sponsors have had
actual control in picking their
successors, even though the Dean of
Students has had official responsibility.
There had been conflicts in the past,
as last year's charges that too many
sponsors were radicals. Then followed
countercharges that the Dean of
Students had vetoed several of the
sponsors' choices because of their
reputations as activists.
This year, the Dean's office has
asserted its control over the entire
sposelection process. Associate Dean of
Students Dan Williams said the Dean's
office took control to form more
unified residential staffs and to
eliminate the dangers of "clubishness"
in "self-perpetuating staff groups."
The sponsors objected in an open
letter that dorms "are the homes of
students, clearly an area in which
(students) should have responsibility."

They said tighter administrative
control will limit "the individuality and
the freedom with which they have
operated" in the past.
Specifics of the new selection
process also angered the sponsors.
Sponsor applicants are to be screened
by committees consisting of a faculty
member, an administrator, a student
member of the residential staff, and
another student. The sponsors have
demanded an additional student staff
member on the screening committees.
Last year, head sponsors assigned to
dorms those applicants judged qualified
by the screening committees. This year,
faculty residents will pick sponsors for
their dorms from a pool of the
qualified.
Williams said selection of sponsors
by the faculty residents they must
work under makes the sponsors more
"accountable" to their superiors and
coordinates the house staff as a single
"team."
But the sponsors said faculty
residents know only a small group of
students and are more likely than
sponsors to show favoritism.
A report they wrote argued "The
consequences of the new selection
system for the applicant who is
unknown to faculty residents or whose
politics are perceived as threatening are
clear."
Beyond selection procedures,
sponsors criticized the new definition
of a sponsor's role once he is chosen.

Next year, sponsors will be called
"house associates" and will be paid
about $900, more than the traditional
free room. Higher-ranked resident
associates will become "senior house
associates" with a cut in pay. And
faculty residents will be called "house
fellows."
The sponsors said the new
"hierarchy of titles" will substitute for
"mutual cooperation." The salary for
sponsoring will change it from "a
creative work of student sefvice" into a
bureaucratic job," they added.
Williams said sponsoring "always has
been a job. It seems to me being a little
more systematic in your definitions
doesn't make everyone a lackey of the
administration."
The salary will simply allow more
students to afford sponsoring in the
face of rising college expenses,
according to Williams.
Hal Mickelson of the ASSU Council
of Presidents said sponsors are only
trying to hold on to their "power of
self-perpetuation," to which others
have "long objected."
Associate Dean Williams emphasized
his approval of this year's sponsors. He
said the changes were simply part of a
basic dorm reorganization. The goal is
to create a unified "residential staff
responsible to one office," he said.
But Rinconada sponsor Dave Iverson
insisted the question is whether
"students will control the places where
students live."
