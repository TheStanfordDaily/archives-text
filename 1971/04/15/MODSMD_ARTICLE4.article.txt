# Three Firebombs Hit Police Headquarters
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Two unidentifiable arsonists
attacked the Stanford Police Station
early yesterday morning at 1:45 a.m.
The two assailants hurled three
molotov cocktails at the compound,
causing one minor fire in front of the
bike rack on the west side of the
station and a broken back window in a
Stanford patrol car.
The other firebomb struck the north
side of the station but failed to ignite.
Officers Leonard Screws and
Raymond Welch reported that the
attackers "had a lot of goddamn nerve"
and predicted that next time the police
reaction would "be different."
Patrolmen Welch and Screws
reportedly left the building just as the
two assailants began running toward
the station from the parking lot with
"bottles in their hands."
Patrolman Yells
The patrolmen yelled at the
attackers at least three times but they
kept coming. Officer Screws claimed

that one of the bombs was thrown at
Welch and himself. Immediately after
the three firebombs were hurled, Welch
returned to the station and called the
fire department which extinguished the
eight to ten foot flames around the
bike rack.
Meanwhile, Screws chased one of the
assailants across the corner of Campus
and Serra into the Manzanita Trailer
Park where he lost the suspect.
The arsonists were described as male
Caucasians, one of them around 5' 10".
Informed but unofficial police
sources said that an arrest is unlikely
due to the sketchiness of Welch's and
Screws' details of attackers.
Other Incidents
In other incidents, $200 worth of
windows were trashed at the Food
Service Building, and a Stanford
patrolman's personal car had its tires
slashed while it was parked in the
police lot.
Spray-painting also continued with a
"death to pigs" warning sprayed on
another patrol car.
