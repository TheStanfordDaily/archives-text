# Prison Recovers From Strike
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK News Analysis 
Prison life at McNeil Island Federal
Penitentiary in Seattle, where a ten-day
strike involving 90% of the inmates last
month brought normal operation to a
standstill, is nearly the same now as
before the strike for all but 74 of the
prisoners.
These 74 are being held in
"segregation," in dungeon quarters,
incommunicado, for their leadership in
the strike.
Some interest in the strike was
generated at Stanford at the end of
winter quarter when crusading author
Jessica Mitford, who is currently
investigating the civil rights of
prisoners, came to campus and spoke
about prison reform.
She took special note of the McNeil
Island situation and arranged to have a
petition circulated on campus urging an
investigation into the handling of the
strike by prison authorities and fair
treatment for strike leaders.
Sign Petition
A few hundred students and about
30 faculty members signed the petition,
copies of which were sent to

Congressman Don Edwards and to the
Director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons in Washington at the beginning
of April.
So far the effort seems to have been
fruitless. The warden at McNeil Island,
Jacob J. Parker, will not acknowledge
whether he has received any directive
from the Brueau of Prisons. And he has
refused to consider the strike demands
or deal with strike leaders in person.
All this is despite Parker's admission
that some of the demands "need to be
looked at" and despite the
overwhelming solidarity of the
prisoners behind the peaceful protest.
According to a number of sources
close to prisoners, more than 90% of
the 1200 inmates remained in their
cells and refused to report for work
during the 10-day period, beginning
February 22.
This meant a nearly total shutdown
of all prison operations, such as
cooking, cleaning, and maintenance,
since most such jobs are handled by the
prisoners themselves.
At the height of the strike prison
officials said that only 50 percent to 60
percent of the inmates struck.

At the beginning of the strike,
prisoners issued thirteen fairly mild
demands, which they chose to call
"proposals," including uniform mail
and visitation privileges, the hiring of a
full-time psychiatrist, and improved
educational and vocational programs in
the prison.
Refusal To Talk
Warden Parker refused to deal with
the demands or consult with the leaders
of the strike. He instead has met with
the prison Men's Advisory Council,
which does not claim to represent the
strike leaders, and has placed the men
he considers instigators "in
segregation."
"Segregation" consists of isolation
from the main body of the prison in a
cold concrete cell, frequently with as
many as three men in a one-man room.
There is sometimes one mattress per
cell, more often none, and maybe a few
blankets. (The inmates in the "hole," as
segregation is called, are "lucky to have
even those things," according to one
prisoner.)
There is no heat and no air
circulation. Conditions are described as
filthy —garbage and lice

even-where—and inspections, which are
supposed to be held once a week by a
medical authority are non-existent.
Inmates are taken out once a week to
bathe in cold water; and there is no
medical care to speak of.
Despite these conditions, many
prisoners in segregation refused to go
back to work even after the strike
ended on March 5, with most prisoners
responding to work calls. According to
the warden, inmates are let out of
segregation as soon as they agree to go
off strike.
But it is known that several inmates
who had little to do with planning the
strike have been put in the "hole" on
strike-related charges. Ono such
prisoner, Lanier A. Ramer, participated
minimally in the strike when it first
started. Like most of the more than
900 striking inmates, he refused to
respond to work call, but had not been
involved in organizing the work
stoppage originally.
