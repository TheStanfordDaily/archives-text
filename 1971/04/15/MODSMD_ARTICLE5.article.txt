# Prison Recovers From Strike
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK News Analysis 
Prison life at McNeil Island Federal
Penitentiary in Seattle, where a ten-day
strike involving 90% of the inmates last
month brought normal operation to a
standstill, is nearly the same now as
before the strike for all but 74 of the
prisoners.
These 74 are being held in
"segregation," in dungeon quarters,
incommunicado, for their leadership in
the strike.
Some interest in the strike was
generated at Stanford at the end of
winter quarter when crusading author
Jessica Mitford, who is currently
investigating the civil rights of
prisoners, came to campus and spoke
about prison reform.
She took special note of the McNeil
Island situation and arranged to have a
petition circulated on campus urging an
investigation into the handling of the
strike by prison authorities and fair
treatment for strike leaders.
Sign Petition
A few hundred students and about
30 faculty members signed the petition,
copies of which were sent to

Congressman Don Edwards and to the
Director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons in Washington at the beginning
of April.
So far the effort seems to have been
fruitless. The warden at McNeil Island,
Jacob J. Parker, will not acknowledge
whether he has received any directive
from the Brueau of Prisons. And he has
refused to consider the strike demands
or deal with strike leaders in person.
All this is despite Parker's admission
that some of the demands "need to be
looked at" and despite the
overwhelming solidarity of the
prisoners behind the peaceful protest.
According to a number of sources
close to prisoners, more than 90% of
the 1200 inmates remained in their
cells and refused to report for work
during the 10-day period, beginning
February 22.
This meant a nearly total shutdown
of all prison operations, such as
cooking, cleaning, and maintenance,
since most such jobs are handled by the
prisoners themselves.
At the height of the strike prison
officials said that only 50 percent to 60
percent of the inmates struck.

At the beginning of the strike,
prisoners issued thirteen fairly mild
demands, which they chose to call
"proposals," including uniform mail
and visitation privileges, the hiring of a
full-time psychiatrist, and improved
educational and vocational programs in
the prison.
Refusal To Talk
Warden Parker refused to deal with
the demands or consult with the leaders
of the strike. He instead has met with
the prison Men's Advisory Council,
which does not claim to represent the
strike leaders, and has placed the men
he considers instigators "in
segregation."
"Segregation" consists of isolation
from the main body of the prison in a
cold concrete cell, frequently with as
many as three men in a one-man room.
There is sometimes one mattress per
cell, more often none, and maybe a few
blankets. (The inmates in the "hole," as
segregation is called, are "lucky to have
even those things," according to one
prisoner.)
There is no heat and no air
circulation. Conditions are described as
filthy —garbage and lice

even-where—and inspections, which are
supposed to be held once a week by a
medical authority are non-existent.
Inmates are taken out once a week to
bathe in cold water; and there is no
medical care to speak of.
Despite these conditions, many
prisoners in segregation refused to go
back to work even after the strike
ended on March 5, with most prisoners
responding to work calls. According to
the warden, inmates are let out of
segregation as soon as they agree to go
off strike.
But it is known that several inmates
who had little to do with planning the
strike have been put in the "hole" on
strike-related charges. Ono such
prisoner, Lanier A. Ramer, participated
minimally in the strike when it first
started. Like most of the more than
900 striking inmates, he refused to
respond to work call, but had not been
involved in organizing the work
stoppage originally.

support of the strike, he was put in the
"hole." When she continued her protest
activities, she got a phone call from a
prison official warning her to "keep her
mouth shut or her husband would
never get parole."
Warden Parker has admitted that the
strike went very peaceably. "There has
been a lot of shouting but other than
that there have been no problems," he
commented. He said that there had
been no property damage.
He also admitted that a number of
leaders were put in segregation, and
that several prisoners had been
transferred out of McNeil. But official
statements after the strike continued to
maintain that no disciplinary action
was taken.
Precise information from inside the
prison is hard to get. Parker has allowed
no outside contact with prisoners since
the strike started; and before the strike
it was difficult even for attorneys or
close relatives to talk to inmates.
According to federal law, lawyers are
to be allowed access to their clients in
prison; and news reporters, although
they may be denied the right to

interview specific persons, are allowed
"random interviews."
A lawsuit was filed two days after
the strike ended, which would allow
freer access to prisoners. The suit,
backed by the ACLU, contends that
the public is being injured in an "illegal
way" by prison administrative
practices. It maintains that the
prisoners' wives, friends, and attorneys
are being denied their reasonable rig! ts
to visit the prisoners, and that i'.io
public's right to know what is going on
inside the federal institution is being
abridged. A court ruling is expected by
May 3.
Prison authorities link the strike to a
stabbing incident in the prison last
November, in which a known psychotic
who was allowed to roam about freely
in the prison fatally wounded another
inmate. It is speculated that prison
guards somehow arranged the incident.
A second lawsuit against prison
officials is pending, a suit which grew
out of the stabbing. The prison
administration is charged with allowing
dangerous psychotics to mix freely
with the other inmates, with refusing to
hire a full-time psychiatrist for the
prison (which inmates say is a violation

of federal law), and refusing to convene
a hearing on sanitary conditions.
The suit asks that prison officials be
stopped from enforcing what the
prisoner-plantiffs call unconstitutional
regulations, and asserts that officials
use "deliberate and systematic policies
of overt racism, favoritism, invidious
grouping, and conspiracy to secrecy."

prisoners themselves.
At the height of the strike prison
officials said that only 50 percent to 60
percent of the inmates struck.

At the beginning of the strike,
prisoners issued thirteen fairly mild
demands, which they chose to call
"proposals," including uniform mail
and visitation privileges, the hiring of a
full-time psychiatrist, and improved
educational and vocational programs in
the prison.
Refusal To Talk
Warden Parker refused to deal with
the demands or consult with the leaders
of the strike. He instead has met with
the prison Men's Advisory Council,
which does not claim to represent the
strike leaders, and has placed the men
he considers instigators "in
segregation."
"Segregation" consists of isolation
from the main body of the prison in a
cold concrete cell, frequently with as
many as three men in a one-man room.
There is sometimes one mattress per
cell, more often none, and maybe a few
blankets. (The inmates in the "hole," as
segregation is called, are "lucky to have
even those things," according to one
prisoner.)
There is no heat and no air
circulation. Conditions are described as
filthy —garbage and lice

even-where—and inspections, which are
supposed to be held once a week by a
medical authority are non-existent.
Inmates are taken out once a week to
bathe in cold water; and there is no
medical care to speak of.
Despite these conditions, many
prisoners in segregation refused to go
back to work even after the strike
ended on March 5, with most prisoners
responding to work calls. According to
the warden, inmates are let out of
segregation as soon as they agree to go
off strike.
But it is known that several inmates
who had little to do with planning the
strike have been put in the "hole" on
strike-related charges. Ono such
prisoner, Lanier A. Ramer, participated
minimally in the strike when it first
started. Like most of the more than
900 striking inmates, he refused to
respond to work call, but had not been
involved in organizing the work
stoppage originally.

support of the strike, he was put in the
"hole." When she continued her protest
activities, she got a phone call from a
prison official warning her to "keep her
mouth shut or her husband would
never get parole."
Warden Parker has admitted that the
strike went very peaceably. "There has
been a lot of shouting but other than
that there have been no problems," he
commented. He said that there had
been no property damage.
He also admitted that a number of
leaders were put in segregation, and
that several prisoners had been
transferred out of McNeil. But official
statements after the strike continued to
maintain that no disciplinary action
was taken.
Precise information from inside the
prison is hard to get. Parker has allowed
no outside contact with prisoners since
the strike started; and before the strike
it was difficult even for attorneys or
close relatives to talk to inmates.
According to federal law, lawyers are
to be allowed access to their clients in
prison; and news reporters, although
they may be denied the right to

interview specific persons, are allowed
"random interviews."
A lawsuit was filed two days after
the strike ended, which would allow
freer access to prisoners. The suit,
backed by the ACLU, contends that
the public is being injured in an "illegal
way" by prison administrative
practices. It maintains that the
prisoners' wives, friends, and attorneys
are being denied their reasonable rig! ts
to visit the prisoners, and that i'.io
public's right to know what is going on
inside the federal institution is being
abridged. A court ruling is expected by
May 3.
Prison authorities link the strike to a
stabbing incident in the prison last
November, in which a known psychotic
who was allowed to roam about freely
in the prison fatally wounded another
inmate. It is speculated that prison
guards somehow arranged the incident.
A second lawsuit against prison
officials is pending, a suit which grew
out of the stabbing. The prison
administration is charged with allowing
dangerous psychotics to mix freely
with the other inmates, with refusing to
hire a full-time psychiatrist for the
prison (which inmates say is a violation

of federal law), and refusing to convene
a hearing on sanitary conditions.
The suit asks that prison officials be
stopped from enforcing what the
prisoner-plantiffs call unconstitutional
regulations, and asserts that officials
use "deliberate and systematic policies
of overt racism, favoritism, invidious
grouping, and conspiracy to secrecy."

Augsburger, 44, holds a law degree
from Case Western Reserve University
and has held executive positions in
several business firms in Ohio and New

The office which he will assume is a

Prison life at McNeil Island Federal
Penitentiary in Seattle, where a ten-day
strike involving 90% of the inmates last
month brought normal operation to a
standstill, is nearly the same now as
before the strike for all but 74 of the
prisoners.
These 74 are being held in
"segregation," in dungeon quarters,
incommunicado, for their leadership in
the strike.
Some interest in the strike was
generated at Stanford at the end of
winter quarter when crusading author
Jessica Mitford, who is currently
investigating the civil rights of
prisoners, came to campus and spoke
about prison reform.
She took special note of the McNeil
Island situation and arranged to have a
petition circulated on campus urging an
investigation into the handling of the
strike by prison authorities and fair
treatment for strike leaders.
Sign Petition
A few hundred students and about
30 faculty members signed the petition,
copies of which were sent to

Congressman Don Edwards and to the
Director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons in Washington at the beginning
of April.
So far the effort seems to have been
fruitless. The warden at McNeil Island,
Jacob J. Parker, will not acknowledge
whether he has received any directive
from the Brueau of Prisons. And he has
refused to consider the strike demands
or deal with strike leaders in person.
All this is despite Parker's admission
that some of the demands "need to be
looked at" and despite the
overwhelming solidarity of the
prisoners behind the peaceful protest.
According to a number of sources
close to prisoners, more than 90% of
the 1200 inmates remained in their
cells and refused to report for work
during the 10-day period, beginning
February 22.
This meant a nearly total shutdown
of all prison operations, such as
cooking, cleaning, and maintenance,

support of the strike, he was put in the

activities, she got a phone call from a
prison official warning her to "keep her
mouth shut or her husband would
never get parole."
Warden Parker has admitted that the
strike went very peaceably. "There has
been a lot of shouting but other than
that there have been no problems," he
commented. He said that there had
been no property damage.
He also admitted that a number of
leaders were put in segregation, and
that several prisoners had been
transferred out of McNeil. But official
statements after the strike continued to
maintain that no disciplinary action
was taken.
Precise information from inside the
prison is hard to get. Parker has allowed
no outside contact with prisoners since
the strike started; and before the strike
it was difficult even for attorneys or
close relatives to talk to inmates.
According to federal law, lawyers are
to be allowed access to their clients in
prison; and news reporters, although
they may be denied the right to

interview specific persons, are allowed
"random interviews."
A lawsuit was filed two days after
the strike ended, which would allow
freer access to prisoners. The suit,
backed by the ACLU, contends that
the public is being injured in an "illegal
way" by prison administrative
practices. It maintains that the
prisoners' wives, friends, and attorneys
are being denied their reasonable rig! ts

inside the federal institution is being
abridged. A court ruling is expected by

Prison authorities link the strike to a
stabbing incident in the prison last
November, in which a known psychotic
who was allowed to roam about freely
in the prison fatally wounded another
inmate. It is speculated that prison
guards somehow arranged the incident.
A second lawsuit against prison
officials is pending, a suit which grew
out of the stabbing. The prison
administration is charged with allowing
dangerous psychotics to mix freely
with the other inmates, with refusing to
hire a full-time psychiatrist for the
prison (which inmates say is a violation

of federal law), and refusing to convene
a hearing on sanitary conditions.
The suit asks that prison officials be
stopped from enforcing what the
prisoner-plantiffs call unconstitutional
regulations, and asserts that officials
use "deliberate and systematic policies
of overt racism, favoritism, invidious
grouping, and conspiracy to secrecy."
VP Selected
Robert R. Augsburger, an Ohio
investment banker, has been named
Stanford Vice President for Business
and Finance. He will take office July 1.
Augsburger, 44, holds a law degree
from Case Western Reserve University
and has held executive positions in
several business firms in Ohio and New
York.
The office which he will assume is a
new position, combining the duties of
the Vice President for Business Affairs,
currently vacant, and the Vice
President for Finance, currently held
by Kenneth M. Cuthbertson.
Cuthbertson assumes the new post of
Vice President for Development on
July 1.
Prison life at McNeil Island Federal
Penitentiary in Seattle, where a ten-day
strike involving 90% of the inmates last
month brought normal operation to a
standstill, is nearly the same now as
before the strike for all but 74 of the
prisoners.
These 74 are being held in
"segregation," in dungeon quarters,
incommunicado, for their leadership in
the strike.
Some interest in the strike was
generated at Stanford at the end of
winter quarter when crusading author
Jessica Mitford, who is currently
investigating the civil rights of
prisoners, came to campus and spoke
about prison reform.
She took special note of the McNeil
Island situation and arranged to have a
petition circulated on campus urging an
investigation into the handling of the
strike by prison authorities and fair
treatment for strike leaders.
Sign Petition
A few hundred students and about
30 faculty members signed the petition,
copies of which were sent to

Congressman Don Edwards and to the
Director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons in Washington at the beginning
of April.
So far the effort seems to have been
fruitless. The warden at McNeil Island,
Jacob J. Parker, will not acknowledge
whether he has received any directive
from the Brueau of Prisons. And he has
refused to consider the strike demands
or deal with strike leaders in person.
All this is despite Parker's admission
that some of the demands "need to be
looked at" and despite the
overwhelming solidarity of the
prisoners behind the peaceful protest.
According to a number of sources
close to prisoners, more than 90% of
the 1200 inmates remained in their
cells and refused to report for work
during the 10-day period, beginning
February 22.
This meant a nearly total shutdown
of all prison operations, such as
cooking, cleaning, and maintenance,
since most such jobs are handled by the
prisoners themselves.
At the height of the strike prison
officials said that only 50 percent to 60
percent of the inmates struck.

At the beginning of the strike,
prisoners issued thirteen fairly mild
demands, which they chose to call
"proposals," including uniform mail
and visitation privileges, the hiring of a
full-time psychiatrist, and improved
educational and vocational programs in
the prison.
Refusal To Talk
Warden Parker refused to deal with
the demands or consult with the leaders
of the strike. He instead has met with
the prison Men's Advisory Council,
which does not claim to represent the
strike leaders, and has placed the men
he considers instigators "in
segregation."
"Segregation" consists of isolation
from the main body of the prison in a
cold concrete cell, frequently with as
many as three men in a one-man room.
There is sometimes one mattress per
cell, more often none, and maybe a few
blankets. (The inmates in the "hole," as
segregation is called, are "lucky to have
even those things," according to one
prisoner.)
There is no heat and no air
circulation. Conditions are described as
filthy —garbage and lice

even-where—and inspections, which are
supposed to be held once a week by a
medical authority are non-existent.
Inmates are taken out once a week to
bathe in cold water; and there is no
medical care to speak of.
Despite these conditions, many
prisoners in segregation refused to go
back to work even after the strike
ended on March 5, with most prisoners
responding to work calls. According to
the warden, inmates are let out of
segregation as soon as they agree to go
off strike.
But it is known that several inmates
who had little to do with planning the
strike have been put in the "hole" on
strike-related charges. Ono such

A lawsuit was filed two days after
the strike ended, which would allow
freer access to prisoners. The suit,
backed by the ACLU, contends that
the public is being injured in an "illegal
way" by prison administrative
practices. It maintains that the
prisoners' wives, friends, and attorneys
are being denied their reasonable rig! ts
to visit the prisoners, and that i'.io
public's right to know what is going on
inside the federal institution is being
abridged. A court ruling is expected by
May 3.
Prison authorities link the strike to a
stabbing incident in the prison last
November, in which a known psychotic
who was allowed to roam about freely
in the prison fatally wounded another
inmate. It is speculated that prison
guards somehow arranged the incident.
A second lawsuit against prison
officials is pending, a suit which grew
out of the stabbing. The prison
administration is charged with allowing
dangerous psychotics to mix freely
with the other inmates, with refusing to
hire a full-time psychiatrist for the
prison (which inmates say is a violation

of federal law), and refusing to convene
a hearing on sanitary conditions.
The suit asks that prison officials be
stopped from enforcing what the
prisoner-plantiffs call unconstitutional
regulations, and asserts that officials
use "deliberate and systematic policies
of overt racism, favoritism, invidious
grouping, and conspiracy to secrecy."
