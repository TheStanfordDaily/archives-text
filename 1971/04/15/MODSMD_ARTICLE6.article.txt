# Dear Police Chief Zurcher:
## 
### 
(The following are letters sent
to James Zurcher, the Palo Alto
police chief. —Ed.)
The search of the Daily offices
by members of the Palo Alto
Police Department last Monday
afternoon clearly represents one
of the most despicable and
dangerous actions ever initiated
by your office. Your failure to
notify and to consult with
members of the University
Administration — clearly not an
oversight — sets an ominous
precedent.
If the Daily which has a policy
concerning incriminiating
evidence much like most other
newspapers in this nation, can be
searched in the manner of last
Monday's visit, then we fear for
the other publications in your
jurisdiction when you have a
whim to investigate their files.

If this blatant act is not in
violation of the letter of the
Constitution —and it is not clear
that it is not — then most
certainly it is in violation of its
spirit. Perhaps it should be
required of those who would
defend freedom and liberty that
they take a course in what they
mean.

I intended to write to you
today praising Lt. Phil Ray, Sgt.
Tony Poso and other Palo Alto
policemen for their superb
cooperation with the press during
the tense Stanford Hospital
incident last Friday. If it weren't
for Phil and Tony and others like
them it would have been

impossible for the news media to
do a creditable job of reporting
that tragic episode.
However, I cannot write to you
and in all good conscience contain
my simultaneous rage and
disappointment over a search of
the offices of The Daily carried
out today by your men.
I can see no difference from a
Constitutional point of view
between the Daily and any
commercial newspaper. Thus, in
my mind, your obtaining of a
warrant and the subsequent search
of Daily offices was a barefaced
violation of First Amendment
guarantees of freedom of the
press.
Even federal agencies have seen
the light in cases like this and
refrained from subpoening
reporters' notes and similar
materials, much less walking in
unannounced and thumbing
through every file in sight.
I would certainly be reluctant
to search diligently for all
available facts in a story if I
thought some of them I turned up
might prompt my friendly
neighborhood policeman to walk

in tomorrow and ransack my
office to find my notebook or
some photographic film. And if I
would be intimidated by that fear,
how could you and all of my
other readers expect to be fully
informed on the events of the
day?
The carrying out of such an act
in the offices of a university
newspaper has even greater
consequences, though. The
particular problem here is that
Stanford is trying to train budding
young writers, which the
newspaper profession needs
desperately. Your actions can do
nothing but turn these young
people into some other line of
work that is less prone to police
interference.
The Daily has exercised its clear
right to refuse to turn over to
police or prosecutors any film or
interview notes; those materials
are the property of the newspaper
and its reporter or photographer.
You must respect this right if
there is to be any real freedom of
the press.
