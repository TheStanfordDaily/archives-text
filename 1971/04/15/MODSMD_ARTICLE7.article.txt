## Student Voice Lost 
### 
sponsors

It is the right and the
responsibility of students to
conduct with dignity and fairness
the affairs of the university in
which their interest predominates.
Living groups, while of interest to
other parts of the community, are
the homes of students, clearly an
area in which they should have
responsibility.
Despite increased student
membership on policy-making
committees, students still have no
effective voice in the official
decision-making process in the
University. While faculty and
administrative staff welcome
student opinion, committees are
set up so that student input is
possible but student influence is
negligible.
A committee like the
Presidential Ad Hoc Committee
on Residences, composed of 11
members (three students and eight
faculty and administrators), gives
only the appearance of student
involvement in the real politics of
the University. By having three
students on the committee,
administrators believe and expect
students to believe that they have
taken part in reaching a

consensus. But no consensus was
reached in areas of important
d isagreement because the
committee split along lines of
interest.
Free Of Domination
The staffing of residences,
particularly sponsor selection,
previously has been relatively free
of domination by administrative
offices. The sponsor system was
student initiated and has been
effectively student-operated,
becoming a meaningful influence
on residential education for many
freshmen. Sponsors have been an
educational force because of their
individuality and the freedom
with which they have operated.
However, we are sensitive to
the charge that the residence staff
perpetuates itself in terms of some
political ideology that can best be
described as a formless activism.
One need only look at the
diversity of political persuasions
and life styles within any one
residence to dispell this myth.
What sponsor selection
committees (formerly two
sponsors, one freshman and one
faculty or administrator) have

successfully perpetuated has been
an attitude of motivating concern
for residence life.
Selection procedures presently
proposed by students would
further increase the influence of
other viewpoints in the selection
and placement process by using
screening committees of two
student staff, one other student,
one faculty member and one
administrator. A student majority
would be maintained.
This was, in fact, the screening
procedure proposed by the
Presidential Committee's study
group, which was changed by the
final presidential committee. The
committee also analyzed,
rationalized, bureuacratized and
defined the residence, eminently
the domain of students. The
committee reached a "consensus"
decision that the student
residence staff is part of an
administrative chain of command
which must be made upwardly
"accountable" to the Faculty
Resident who is in turn
accountable to administrative
offices (the Dean of Students
Office, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies office, and
the Business office).
Students Should Choose
The best way to choose
students for residence staff
positions who will be responsible
to other students is not to turn
over the selection procedure to
other groups interested primarily
in responsibility to administrative
demands. No one could be more
in touch with the diverse facets of
dorm life than those students who
live in the midst of the diversity.
No one could be more responsive
to the changing needs and
attitudes of students than other
students. And yet we are being
told that for the best interests of
the students and the residence
staff, the selection control will
rest mainly in the hands of faculty
residents.
Furthermore, one questions
the sincerity of pledges by the
administrative offices to consult
closely with students. The Dean
of Students office began new
selection procedures for residence
staff and "forgot" even to tell the
present residence staff that they
had begun to act on the
recommendations of the yet
unpublished president's report.
The same type of concern allowed
the administrators to refer a
sponsor-written staffing proposal
to a non-existent subcommittee.
When the proposal was curiously
not acted upon, it was "no one's
fault."
The recommendations of the
president's committee now being
implemented by the Dean of
Students office curtail the voice
of those who know the role of
sponsor or R.A. best: s udents
who live in the residences and
those who have experienced the
challenges and limitations of that
role. It substitutes student input
for student responsibility. It
weakens the participation of
students in the residences. Pay
raises and "merit" awards do not
motivate commitment to
residential education. What does
motivate us is a feeling of
responsibility born of a
fundamental right to conduct
those processes which directly
affect us. That right will also
motivate us to defend that
responsibility.

It is the right and the
responsibility of students to
conduct with dignity and fairness
the affairs of the university in
which their interest predominates.
Living groups, while of interest to
other parts of the community, are
the homes of students, clearly an
area in which they should have
responsibility.
Despite increased student
membership on policy-making
committees, students still have no
effective voice in the official
decision-making process in the
University. While faculty and
administrative staff welcome
student opinion, committees are
set up so that student input is
possible but student influence is
negligible.
A committee like the
Presidential Ad Hoc Committee
on Residences, composed of 11
members (three students and eight
faculty and administrators), gives
only the appearance of student
involvement in the real politics of
the University. By having three
students on the committee,
administrators believe and expect
students to believe that they have
taken part in reaching a

consensus. But no consensus was
reached in areas of important
d isagreement because the
committee split along lines of
interest.
Free Of Domination
The staffing of residences,
particularly sponsor selection,
previously has been relatively free
of domination by administrative
offices. The sponsor system was
student initiated and has been
effectively student-operated,
becoming a meaningful influence
on residential education for many
freshmen. Sponsors have been an
educational force because of their
individuality and the freedom
with which they have operated.
However, we are sensitive to
the charge that the residence staff
perpetuates itself in terms of some
political ideology that can best be
described as a formless activism.
One need only look at the
diversity of political persuasions
and life styles within any one
residence to dispell this myth.
What sponsor selection
committees (formerly two
sponsors, one freshman and one
faculty or administrator) have

successfully perpetuated has been
an attitude of motivating concern
for residence life.
Selection procedures presently
proposed by students would
further increase the influence of
other viewpoints in the selection
and placement process by using
screening committees of two
student staff, one other student,
one faculty member and one
administrator. A student majority
would be maintained.
This was, in fact, the screening
procedure proposed by the
Presidential Committee's study
group, which was changed by the
final presidential committee. The
committee also analyzed,
rationalized, bureuacratized and
defined the residence, eminently
the domain of students. The
committee reached a "consensus"
decision that the student
residence staff is part of an
administrative chain of command
which must be made upwardly
"accountable" to the Faculty
Resident who is in turn
accountable to administrative
offices (the Dean of Students
Office, the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies office, and
the Business office).
Students Should Choose
The best way to choose
students for residence staff
positions who will be responsible
to other students is not to turn
over the selection procedure to
other groups interested primarily
in responsibility to administrative
demands. No one could be more
in touch with the diverse facets of
dorm life than those students who
live in the midst of the diversity.
No one could be more responsive
to the changing needs and
attitudes of students than other
students. And yet we are being
told that for the best interests of
the students and the residence
staff, the selection control will
rest mainly in the hands of faculty
residents.
Furthermore, one questions
the sincerity of pledges by the
administrative offices to consult
closely with students. The Dean
of Students office began new
selection procedures for residence
staff and "forgot" even to tell the
present residence staff that they
had begun to act on the
recommendations of the yet
unpublished president's report.
The same type of concern allowed
the administrators to refer a
sponsor-written staffing proposal
to a non-existent subcommittee.
