bill legal
Editor, THE DAILY:
Section 1.03 of the By Laws of
the Associated Students of
Stanford University reads:
"Certification of election shall be
defined as the approval by the
Senate of a resolution certifying
the results of an election."
Since the Senate has not
certified the election of April 7-8,
1971, the results of that election
are not official. Specifically, the
proposed By-Law stating that,
"No monies shall be disbursed or
transfered (sic) from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve without the
approval of a majority of the
members in the Association voting
in a general election," is not part
of the ASSU By-Laws.
The bill passed by the Senate
Tuesday night, which loans
money from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve to the Bail
Fund and which transfers money
from the Underwriting Reserve to
the Senate Contingency Reserve,
is legal.

drake response
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to F.W. Crawford's
sarcastic bit of innuendo, in the
letter, "Wise Counsel," did it ever
occur to that "wise" professor
that my absence this year from
the Committee of 15 meetings
may have reflected reluctance to
waste my time on details of
revising legalistic documents when
basic policy issues and ethnical
questions remained unsettled? I
think I was just as active as some
of the other members last year.
We had difficulty getting a
quorum every now and then.
The intent of my resignation
was not to attack the Committee
which has a legitimate function.
(For those who can function on
it, all power to them.) However,
Crawford chose to interpret it as
an attack and thus has forced me
to say what might have been best
left unsaid.

depressing articles
Editor, THE DAILY:
Among the many depressing
articles in today's Daily were two
that were particularly infuriating.
First, the attempt by the ASSU
Senate to bypass results of the
election by cleaning out the
Underwriting Reserve funds at the
last moment. This is the first
factual evidence I have seen to
back up accusations of power
politics and financial
mis-management in the Senate.
Second was the article about
the larceny at TMU and the
ensuing beating of several FCMers.
The course of protest in this
country has evolved from its
non-violent origins, when
protesters breaking the law were
willing to accept the
consequences, to its present state
where protesters not only demand
absolute immunity from the law
but claim the right to physically
attack the property and person of
any who attempt to oppose them
with completely legal means.
It seems to me that it is time
for the University community to
totally repudiate this behavior. If
necessary, the FCMers should be
given police protection when they
chose to exercise their legal rights,
and protesters should be forced to
accept the legal consequences of
their illegal actions.

Tuesday night, which loans
money from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve to the Bail
Fund and which transfers money
from the Underwriting Reserve to
the Senate Contingency Reserve,
is legal.

drake response
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to F.W. Crawford's
sarcastic bit of innuendo, in the
letter, "Wise Counsel," did it ever
occur to that "wise" professor
that my absence this year from
the Committee of 15 meetings
may have reflected reluctance to
waste my time on details of
revising legalistic documents when
basic policy issues and ethnical
questions remained unsettled? I
think I was just as active as some
of the other members last year.
We had difficulty getting a
quorum every now and then.
The intent of my resignation
was not to attack the Committee
which has a legitimate function.
(For those who can function on
it, all power to them.) However,
Crawford chose to interpret it as
an attack and thus has forced me
to say what might have been best
left unsaid.

depressing articles
Editor, THE DAILY:
Among the many depressing
articles in today's Daily were two
that were particularly infuriating.
First, the attempt by the ASSU
Senate to bypass results of the
election by cleaning out the
Underwriting Reserve funds at the
last moment. This is the first
factual evidence I have seen to
back up accusations of power
politics and financial
mis-management in the Senate.
Second was the article about
the larceny at TMU and the
ensuing beating of several FCMers.
The course of protest in this
country has evolved from its
non-violent origins, when
protesters breaking the law were
willing to accept the
consequences, to its present state
where protesters not only demand
absolute immunity from the law
but claim the right to physically
attack the property and person of
any who attempt to oppose them
with completely legal means.
It seems to me that it is time
for the University community to
totally repudiate this behavior. If
necessary, the FCMers should be
given police protection when they
chose to exercise their legal rights,
and protesters should be forced to
accept the legal consequences of
their illegal actions.

bill legal
Editor, THE DAILY:
Section 1.03 of the By Laws of
the Associated Students of
Stanford University reads:
"Certification of election shall be
defined as the approval by the
Senate of a resolution certifying
the results of an election."
Since the Senate has not
certified the election of April 7-8,
1971, the results of that election
are not official. Specifically, the
proposed By-Law stating that,
"No monies shall be disbursed or
transfered (sic) from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve without the
approval of a majority of the
members in the Association voting
in a general election," is not part
of the ASSU By-Laws.
The bill passed by the Senate
Tuesday night, which loans
money from the ASSU
Underwriting Reserve to the Bail
Fund and which transfers money
from the Underwriting Reserve to
the Senate Contingency Reserve,
is legal.
