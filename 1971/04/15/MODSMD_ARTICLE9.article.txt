## Electoral Democracy Lives 
### 
Ron wyden

Frequently I feel like Alice
must have in Wonderland. Or
maybe Rip Van Winkle. Along
with the rest of the liberals, I am
still saying "The system can be
made to work, we are going to get
reform this year." 1 talk just like
the liberals of five years ago, and
still believe change can come
through electoral democracy.
Sometimes I have to pinch myself
to make sure I'm real.
Last week's municipal elections
in Berkeley, however, prove that
reports of the death of electoral
democracy are premature. There
liberals, and liberals masquerading
as radicals transferred their dissent
into successful, democratic action.
They proved that parliamentary
procedure or violence are not our
only political options. They won
because they were better
organized than their opponents,
and because they registered
10,000 new voters.
What if this kind of organizing,
registering, and canvassing was
done with the 18.5 million newly
eligible voters for the next federal
elections? 11.5 million voters
between eighteen and twenty-one,
and 7.1 million persons, ages 21

and 22, will have the opportunity
to vote for the first time. If they
vote en masse they will decide the
election.
Voter Analysis Studies,
however, indicate that they will
do no such thing. They have
found that young people tend to
register and vote in lower
proportion than do older people,
and that most young voters tend
to vote in much the same way as
their parents.
The campuses seem to be the
place to begin proving these
analyses wrong. The way to do
this is to start now—by getting
students deputized as registrars,
and by devising means to get
young people registered
The premise behind the plan to
organize eighteen to twenty-two
year old voters is that the new
voters, when registered and given
all the facts and issues, will make
intelligent decisions about the
future of this country, and will
reject President Nixon for a
candidate truly of this country,
and will reject President Nixon for
a candidate truly committed to
scrapping the Thieu-Ky
government and attending to our

pressing domestic problems.
To build a movement of newly
eligible young voters with the
political muscle to dump
President Nixon will require more
of a "committment" than most of
us made in 1968 for peace. If
we commit ourselves to the idea
that through the newly eligible
young voters we can move the
center of the political spectrum
slightly to the left, rather than
indulging our fantasies as to what
we should do if it doesn't work,
Richard Nixon will be able to
start his memoirs in January of
1973.

and 22, will have the opportunity
to vote for the first time. If they
vote en masse they will decide the
election.
Voter Analysis Studies,
however, indicate that they will
do no such thing. They have
found that young people tend to
register and vote in lower
proportion than do older people,
and that most young voters tend
to vote in much the same way as
their parents.
The campuses seem to be the
place to begin proving these
analyses wrong. The way to do
this is to start now—by getting
students deputized as registrars,
and by devising means to get
young people registered
The premise behind the plan to
organize eighteen to twenty-two
year old voters is that the new
voters, when registered and given
all the facts and issues, will make
intelligent decisions about the
future of this country, and will
reject President Nixon for a
candidate truly of this country,
and will reject President Nixon for
a candidate truly committed to
scrapping the Thieu-Ky
government and attending to our

pressing domestic problems.
To build a movement of newly
eligible young voters with the
political muscle to dump
President Nixon will require more
of a "committment" than most of
us made in 1968 for peace. If
we commit ourselves to the idea
that through the newly eligible
young voters we can move the
center of the political spectrum
slightly to the left, rather than
indulging our fantasies as to what
we should do if it doesn't work,
Richard Nixon will be able to
start his memoirs in January of
1973.

Frequently I feel like Alice
must have in Wonderland. Or
maybe Rip Van Winkle. Along
with the rest of the liberals, I am
still saying "The system can be
made to work, we are going to get
reform this year." 1 talk just like
the liberals of five years ago, and
still believe change can come
through electoral democracy.
Sometimes I have to pinch myself
to make sure I'm real.
Last week's municipal elections
in Berkeley, however, prove that
reports of the death of electoral
democracy are premature. There
liberals, and liberals masquerading
as radicals transferred their dissent
into successful, democratic action.
They proved that parliamentary
procedure or violence are not our
only political options. They won
because they were better
organized than their opponents,
and because they registered
10,000 new voters.
What if this kind of organizing,
registering, and canvassing was
done with the 18.5 million newly
eligible voters for the next federal
elections? 11.5 million voters
between eighteen and twenty-one,
and 7.1 million persons, ages 21

and 22, will have the opportunity
to vote for the first time. If they
vote en masse they will decide the
election.
