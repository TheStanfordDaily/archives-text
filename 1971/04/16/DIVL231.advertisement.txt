| Today In The 4 Daily 9
8 Twenty-eight years ago today, the Daily ran an ad entitled S
8 "Do You Dig It?" picturing a young collegiate and a co-ed. The X
8 copy read: "Don't stuff me off, Queen. I'm with lettuce. How K
8 about putt in' the show on the road and hittin' the hangout to S
8 snaffle a Pepsi-Cola." |
b We of the Daily take a firm and equivocal stand against x
0 stuffing and in favor of snaffling, wherever and whenever, and X
0 we wish the winsome couple of 1943 the best of luck with their x
lettuce. x
In the same memorable issue, the staff congratulated Janet x
McClanahan on becoming the first woman student body x
president. She was efficient, but not officious, they said. She X
j J was an ideal person to represent Stanford University. Well. X
If you would like to stuff a student body president, the x
editorial office (x4632) wilt have nothing to do with it. The 8
business office is filled with snafflers, however. Call 327-4150. 8
