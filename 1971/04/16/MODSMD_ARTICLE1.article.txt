# Tresidder Endures Boycott

News Analysis
The boycott of Tresidder Memorial
Union being staged by several workers'
organizations does not appear to be
headed toward success in obtaining the
rehiring of twelve laid-off workers,
although it is keeping some customers
away from the TMU food service.
Nevertheless, its supporters are not
about to give up.
The month-old boycott was
instigated when the twelve were laid off
their jobs in a service cutback. The
boycott goal is to reduce Tresidder's
business to the extent that the TMU
management will feel compelled to
rehire them to relieve economic
pressure.
The boycott is apparently not
significantly hurting Tresidder's
financial situation, however. The Union
has suffered a decline in business
through the entire school year and
short-term figures cannot be computed
with sufficient accuracy to pinpoint the
effects of the boycott, according to
TMU officials.
TMU Director Forrest Tregea seems
content to "wait out" the boycott. He

does not contemplate either restoring
the service cutbacks or reducing
services further in the near future.
Several Groups Involved
The major groups sponsoring the
boycott are the United Stanford
Employees, the Black United Front,
and Venceremos. A number of
unaffiliated individuals also take part.
The boycott lacks organization, but
seems to make up for it with dedication
and enthusiasm.
The main thrust of the boycotters'
activity has been an "Alternate Food
Service" on the Tresidder patio during
weekday lunch hours. Supporters of
the boycott can purchase various
homemade and pre-packaged foods.
Proceeds from this capitalist venture go
into a fund for the laid-off workers.
The boycotters prepare the food at the
nearby United Campus Ministry
Clubhouse.
The "Alternate Food Service"
appears to be doing a fairly brisk
business. According to Joe Hardegree
of the Campus Ministry, an active
boycotter, there has been a significant
increase in sales this week. He
attributes this to persons showing

support for Black and Chicano protests
at the Medical Center.
In addition to the food sales, pickets
are stationed at the doors to the
Tresidder cafeteria to confront
customers not honoring the boycott.
The picketing has been peaceful;
however, abusive remarks are
occasionally exchanged by pickets and
customers.
Picket lines have also been placed at
the Tresidder unloading dock, in an
unsuccessful attempt to block delivery
of food to TMU. On at least one
occasion there was a scuffle there
between pickets and Tresidder officials;
some truck drivers have unloaded under
police guard.
Tuesday's impromptu "eat-in" by
black students, although unplanned,
was interpreted by boycotters as a
gesture of support for their cause. The
boycott participants emphasize the
unity of their campaign with those of
minority groups at the Medical Center
and elsewhere. Their picket signs
reduce the world to a dichotomy:
workers and third-world people on the
one hand, the imperialistic Stanford

administration on the other. "Which
side are you on?" they ask.
One attempt has been made to
expand the boycott beyond Tresidder.
A picket line was placed at the Faculty
Club on March 31, but club members
appeared undeterred. The boycotters,
apparently conceding failure, have not
returned.
In the meantime, the Alternate
Food Service lives as a parasite on
Tresidder Union. The boycotters have
used TMU's tables, and, according to
Tregea, leave their waste paper for
Tresidder custodians to remove.
No Legal Action Taken
Union and University officials have
not attempted to take legal action
against the Alternate Food Service,
although it is operating in competition
with the Tresidder cafeteria while
located on university property. Health
inspectors visited the boycotters, at the
request of unknown persons, hut they
have no direct enforcement powers
and neither they nor the university
administration have filed a complaint
with the District Attorney. These facts

neither does he contemplate rehiring the "terminated" employees.
indicate the less-than-serious attitude
taken by authorities in the face of the
boycott.
The Alternate Food Service seems to
have found no foolproof way to cope
with the übiquitous Tresidder dogs or
the birds which perch in an overhead
tree. Presumably the health officials
looked a bit askanie as the boycotters
shooed away these animals, who seem
to make no distinction between
"establishment" TMU food and the
boycotters' fare.
Both sides in the dispute have
complained of moderate harassment,
but neither seems overly fazed. With
the exception of the one scuffle at the
unloading dock two weeks ago, there
have been no violent or near-violent
situations.

Tresidder employees have continued
on their jobs as usual, although some
have complained of threats from the
pickets and some fear that the boycott
will hurt business to the degree that
more layoffs will be made. Teamsters
Union deliverymen, although at first
somewhat stymied by the picket line at
the delivery dock, have taken to
crossing the line. The neat "workers v.
employers" dichotomy of the
boycotters is not holding true in
practice.
Each side seems confident that it has
the upper hand. Tregea appears assured
that Tresidder's business will continue
at near-normal levels through the
boycott, and is waiting for the protest
to run its course. Boycott leaders,
citing some of the labor-management
disputes of the early years of this

century, view the boycott as their one
weapon against layoffs, and vow to
continue until the twelve employees are
rehired. They are convinced that they
are making a dent in Tresidder's
revenues.
The Tresidder authorities, whom the
boycott sought to ruin economically,
are reacting with a combination of
tolerance and amusement. This fact,
above all others, indicates the boycott's
lack of success.
But in the meantime, the "waiting
game" continues, a miniature social
drama in which insurgents are taking on
the "establishment" at its own
economic game. Two weeks'
observation of the boycott activity
compels the conclusion that the
"establishment" will win this round,
but its foes are not about to give up.
