# Tresidder Endures Boycott

News Analysis
The boycott of Tresidder Memorial
Union being staged by several workers'
organizations does not appear to be
headed toward success in obtaining the
rehiring of twelve laid-off workers,
although it is keeping some customers
away from the TMU food service.
Nevertheless, its supporters are not
about to give up.
The month-old boycott was
instigated when the twelve were laid off
their jobs in a service cutback. The
boycott goal is to reduce Tresidder's
business to the extent that the TMU
management will feel compelled to
rehire them to relieve economic
pressure.
The boycott is apparently not
significantly hurting Tresidder's
financial situation, however. The Union
has suffered a decline in business
through the entire school year and
short-term figures cannot be computed
with sufficient accuracy to pinpoint the
effects of the boycott, according to
TMU officials.
TMU Director Forrest Tregea seems
content to "wait out" the boycott. He

does not contemplate either restoring
the service cutbacks or reducing
services further in the near future.
Several Groups Involved
The major groups sponsoring the
boycott are the United Stanford
Employees, the Black United Front,
and Venceremos. A number of
unaffiliated individuals also take part.
The boycott lacks organization, but
seems to make up for it with dedication
and enthusiasm.
The main thrust of the boycotters'
activity has been an "Alternate Food
Service" on the Tresidder patio during
weekday lunch hours. Supporters of
the boycott can purchase various
homemade and pre-packaged foods.
Proceeds from this capitalist venture go
into a fund for the laid-off workers.
The boycotters prepare the food at the
nearby United Campus Ministry
Clubhouse.
The "Alternate Food Service"
appears to be doing a fairly brisk
business. According to Joe Hardegree
of the Campus Ministry, an active
boycotter, there has been a significant
increase in sales this week. He
attributes this to persons showing

support for Black and Chicano protests
at the Medical Center.
In addition to the food sales, pickets
are stationed at the doors to the
Tresidder cafeteria to confront
customers not honoring the boycott.
The picketing has been peaceful;
however, abusive remarks are
occasionally exchanged by pickets and
customers.
Picket lines have also been placed at
the Tresidder unloading dock, in an
unsuccessful attempt to block delivery
of food to TMU. On at least one
occasion there was a scuffle there
between pickets and Tresidder officials;
some truck drivers have unloaded under
police guard.
Tuesday's impromptu "eat-in" by
black students, although unplanned,
was interpreted by boycotters as a
gesture of support for their cause. The
boycott participants emphasize the
unity of their campaign with those of
minority groups at the Medical Center
and elsewhere. Their picket signs
reduce the world to a dichotomy:
workers and third-world people on the
one hand, the imperialistic Stanford

administration on the other. "Which
side are you on?" they ask.
One attempt has been made to
expand the boycott beyond Tresidder.
A picket line was placed at the Faculty
Club on March 31, but club members
appeared undeterred. The boycotters,
apparently conceding failure, have not
returned.
In the meantime, the Alternate
Food Service lives as a parasite on
Tresidder Union. The boycotters have
used TMU's tables, and, according to
Tregea, leave their waste paper for
Tresidder custodians to remove.
No Legal Action Taken
Union and University officials have
not attempted to take legal action
against the Alternate Food Service,
although it is operating in competition
with the Tresidder cafeteria while
located on university property. Health
inspectors visited the boycotters, at the
request of unknown persons, hut they
have no direct enforcement powers
and neither they nor the university
administration have filed a complaint
with the District Attorney. These facts

STANDING FlRM—Forrest Tregea, Tresidder director, is "waiting out" the
boycott in support of laid-off workers. He sees no further reduction in services,
neither does he contemplate rehiring the "terminated" employees.
