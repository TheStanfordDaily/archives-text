# Tenure Affords Job Security

### DAVE GLOSSBRENNER 
Tenure is a word often heard
and rarely understood around a
college campus. Just what it is and
how one attains it is often a
mystery.
The process of getting tenure,"
says Vice-Provost Brooks, "is
about the same as that of
appointment." According to him
about 72% of the Stanford faculty
has tenure. This includes
professors, associate professors,
assistant professors, and
instructors, for it is possible for a
faculty member to receive tenure
while serving at any one of these
levels.
There are two ways by which a
faculty member receives tenure. If
his original appointment or any
appointment there after carries no
time limit he is considered to have
tenure. Also, any appointment
that extends the time of service
with the University beyond seven
years carries tenure with it.
When each department makes
its yearly recommendations for
appointment or promotion, it
notes those that would confer

tenure. These recommendations
are submitted to the Provost who
then sends them to the Advisory
Board. After reviewing the
proposals the Board sends its
recommendations to the President
who presents them to the Board
of Trustees. The Trustees have the
final say in all appointments and
is the body that actually confers
tenure.
In the case that the President
and Advisory Board disagree the
President must submit his
objections to the Advisory Board
which will then review the matter.
If the Board and President still
cannot agree the decision is left
up to the Trustees.
According to the policy
statement a suspension with pay
of a faculty member is not a
violation of the terms of tenure.
Such a suspension, however, is
only justified during the
proceedings of dismissal when
immediate harm to the faculty
member or others is threatened by
his continuance in his regular
duties.
The process of dismissal or
"penalization by discriminatory

reduction of salary" begins with
confidential notification of the
faculty member of the charges
against him. A hearing before the
Advisory Board then follows. The
results of the hearing are
submitted to the President. If the
final decision of the President and
Advisory Board is for dismissal
the Board of Trustees must
concur.
* While "security of
appointment" is the right not to
be "dismissed, involuntarily
retired early, or subjected to
discriminatory reduction of
salary," there are circumstances in

which the University may bring
such action. These circumstances
are "substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and
manifest neglect of duty, or
personal conduct impairing the
individual's performance of his
appropriate functions within the
University community."
Actions of dismissal or early
retirement may be taken by the
President only after consulting the
Advisory Board and in cases of
the faculty member's "serious or
protracted disability" or of the
University's "extraordinary
financial emergency."

If the Board and President still
cannot agree the decision is left
up to the Trustees.
According to the policy
statement a suspension with pay
of a faculty member is not a
violation of the terms of tenure.
Such a suspension, however, is
only justified during the
proceedings of dismissal when
immediate harm to the faculty
member or others is threatened by
his continuance in his regular
duties.
The process of dismissal or
"penalization by discriminatory

reduction of salary" begins with
confidential notification of the
faculty member of the charges
against him. A hearing before the
Advisory Board then follows. The
results of the hearing are
submitted to the President. If the
final decision of the President and
Advisory Board is for dismissal
the Board of Trustees must
concur.
* While "security of
appointment" is the right not to
be "dismissed, involuntarily
retired early, or subjected to
discriminatory reduction of
salary," there are circumstances in

which the University may bring
such action. These circumstances
are "substantial and manifest
incompetence, substantial and
manifest neglect of duty, or
personal conduct impairing the
individual's performance of his
appropriate functions within the
University community."
Actions of dismissal or early
retirement may be taken by the
President only after consulting the
Advisory Board and in cases of
the faculty member's "serious or
protracted disability" or of the
University's "extraordinary
financial emergency."
Tenure is a word often heard
and rarely understood around a
college campus. Just what it is and
how one attains it is often a
mystery.
The process of getting tenure,"
says Vice-Provost Brooks, "is
about the same as that of
appointment." According to him
about 72% of the Stanford faculty
has tenure. This includes
professors, associate professors,
assistant professors, and
instructors, for it is possible for a
faculty member to receive tenure
while serving at any one of these
levels.
There are two ways by which a
faculty member receives tenure. If
his original appointment or any
appointment there after carries no
time limit he is considered to have
tenure. Also, any appointment
that extends the time of service
with the University beyond seven
years carries tenure with it.
When each department makes
its yearly recommendations for
appointment or promotion, it
notes those that would confer

tenure. These recommendations
are submitted to the Provost who
then sends them to the Advisory
Board. After reviewing the
proposals the Board sends its
recommendations to the President
who presents them to the Board
of Trustees. The Trustees have the
final say in all appointments and
is the body that actually confers
tenure.
In the case that the President
and Advisory Board disagree the
President must submit his
objections to the Advisory Board
which will then review the matter.
