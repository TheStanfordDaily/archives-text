# Faye Dunaway: 'Promising'
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I have somehow managed to see
four films starring Faye Dunaway
in the last eight days and this is
perhaps as good a time as any to
examine Faye's career to date as
well as to consider the current
dearth of young Hollywood
actresses who possess any genuine
sexuality and a modicum of
talent.
With the glaring exception of
Raquel Welch, all contemporary
starlets I know of deny aspiring to
the throne of Sex Goddess. There
are surely those observers who
contend that the worship of
glamourized faces and bodies is a
sexist, chauvinist and decadent
(not to mention old-fashioned)
paractice.
However, to deny the appeal
performers can have for us is to
deny an intrinsic appeal of the
movies, and in movies, even more
than in life, there's more to looks
than meets the eye.
Despite the standardization of
taste and the frightful
personalities of many studio
heads, one of the merits of the
late Hollywood star system was
that films were often tailored for
the performers themselves.
Doubtless, many actors in
Hollywood at the time were never
able or allowed to find their
proper niche, but if ever the ends
justified the means, the studio
system was it, for it was there that
legends were made. And we're
dreadfully short on legends these
days.
Today, the good young
actresses face not only the eternal
nemesis of competition but a lack
of roles which are worthy of their

creative, as opposed to physical,
attributes.
Too many actresses just now
are stuck with the description
"promising," a word which must
sound particularly terrifying to
talents such as Tuesday Weld and
Stella Stevens who, though still
young, have been around for
years.
Too many actresses have had
just one role in which they could
truly shine. Indeed, one good role
is usually enough to convince
their detractors that they are
more than just another pretty
face, but it is also enough to
prompt even their admirerers to
complain of the absence of
repeated brilliance.
Up until now, Jane Fonda has
had her "They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?," Mia Farrow her
"Rosemary's Baby," Stella
Stevens her "The Silencers,"
Katherine Ross her "The
Graduate" and Tuesday Weld her
"Pretty Poison" and though they
keep working, we'll be lucky to
see them that good again.
Perhaps the most luscious and
promising of them all, Jacqueline
Bisset, has had wide exposure in
"Bullitt" and "Airport," but
those films can hardly be
considered personal triumphs for
her.
Which brings us back to Faye
Dunaway. Her first film, "The
Happening," was, I think,
deservedly neglected. Before
either this or her second fiasco,
Otto Preminger's "Hurry
Sundown," was released, Faye
was cast in "Bonnie and Clyde"
(as Fate would have it, Jane
Fonda and Tuesday Weld were

previously offered the part of
Bonnie, but both declined).
Seen today, "Bonnie and
Clyde" already looks like a
certified classic out of the past,
and the editing seems to play
particularly in Faye's favor.
Skipping over "The
Extraordinary Seaman," "A Place
for Lovers" and"The Thomas
Crown Affair" (which was really
her only swinging sixties-jet set
film), we find "The
Arrangement." An intriguing but
agonizingly personal testament,
director Elia Kazan drew the best
from Faye just as he had from
Natalie Wood in "Splendor in the
Grass."
'Downfall Child'
Faye is also excellent in her
newest film, "Puzzle of a
Downfall Child," though again the
acclaim hasn't been unanimous
enough to truly say she's broken
the sophomore jinx.
Her character here as a high
fashion model is even more elusive
than in "The Arrangement," and
all indications are that it is a fairly
biographical study of Faye by her
longtime companion and
photographer Jerry Schatzberg.
Part of what is exceptional
about Faye Dunaway, especially
in "Puzzle," is that she is capable
of bringing inner pressures and
neurosis to their physical
realization on her face without
emoting or over-acting.
Faye can never help but look
stunning (she may have the
greatest cheekbones since
Dietrich, to whom she is
compared in "Puzzle"), but she
also excels in a prematurely
wasted look, with nerves shot,
nails chewed to the finger and too
many drinks and pills downed.
As she retreats in the film's
final shot with her hair drawn
back in a tight bun, one could half
expect a turned head to reveal the
face of a (50 year-old woman.
In any event, "Puzzle of a
Downfall Child" is one of the
most probing and "promising"
directorial debuts I've seen
recently and is worth tracking
down.

considered personal triumphs for
her.
Which brings us back to Faye
Dunaway. Her first film, "The
Happening," was, I think,
deservedly neglected. Before
either this or her second fiasco,
Otto Preminger's "Hurry
Sundown," was released, Faye
was cast in "Bonnie and Clyde"
(as Fate would have it, Jane
Fonda and Tuesday Weld were

previously offered the part of
Bonnie, but both declined).
Seen today, "Bonnie and
Clyde" already looks like a
certified classic out of the past,
and the editing seems to play
particularly in Faye's favor.
Skipping over "The
Extraordinary Seaman," "A Place
for Lovers" and"The Thomas
Crown Affair" (which was really
her only swinging sixties-jet set
film), we find "The
Arrangement." An intriguing but
agonizingly personal testament,
director Elia Kazan drew the best
from Faye just as he had from
Natalie Wood in "Splendor in the
Grass."
'Downfall Child'
Faye is also excellent in her
newest film, "Puzzle of a
Downfall Child," though again the
acclaim hasn't been unanimous
enough to truly say she's broken
the sophomore jinx.
Her character here as a high
fashion model is even more elusive
than in "The Arrangement," and
all indications are that it is a fairly
biographical study of Faye by her
longtime companion and
photographer Jerry Schatzberg.
Part of what is exceptional
about Faye Dunaway, especially
in "Puzzle," is that she is capable
of bringing inner pressures and
neurosis to their physical
realization on her face without
emoting or over-acting.
Faye can never help but look
stunning (she may have the
greatest cheekbones since
Dietrich, to whom she is
compared in "Puzzle"), but she
also excels in a prematurely
wasted look, with nerves shot,
nails chewed to the finger and too
many drinks and pills downed.
As she retreats in the film's
final shot with her hair drawn
back in a tight bun, one could half
expect a turned head to reveal the
face of a (50 year-old woman.
In any event, "Puzzle of a
Downfall Child" is one of the
most probing and "promising"
directorial debuts I've seen
recently and is worth tracking
down.


Faye Dunaway
I have somehow managed to see
four films starring Faye Dunaway
in the last eight days and this is
perhaps as good a time as any to
examine Faye's career to date as
well as to consider the current
dearth of young Hollywood
actresses who possess any genuine
sexuality and a modicum of
talent.
With the glaring exception of
Raquel Welch, all contemporary
starlets I know of deny aspiring to
the throne of Sex Goddess. There
are surely those observers who
contend that the worship of
glamourized faces and bodies is a
sexist, chauvinist and decadent
(not to mention old-fashioned)
paractice.
However, to deny the appeal
performers can have for us is to
deny an intrinsic appeal of the
movies, and in movies, even more
than in life, there's more to looks
than meets the eye.
Despite the standardization of
taste and the frightful
personalities of many studio
heads, one of the merits of the
late Hollywood star system was
that films were often tailored for
the performers themselves.
Doubtless, many actors in
Hollywood at the time were never
able or allowed to find their
proper niche, but if ever the ends
justified the means, the studio
system was it, for it was there that
legends were made. And we're
dreadfully short on legends these
days.
Today, the good young
actresses face not only the eternal
nemesis of competition but a lack
of roles which are worthy of their

creative, as opposed to physical,
attributes.
Too many actresses just now
are stuck with the description
"promising," a word which must
sound particularly terrifying to
talents such as Tuesday Weld and
Stella Stevens who, though still
young, have been around for
years.
Too many actresses have had
just one role in which they could
truly shine. Indeed, one good role
is usually enough to convince
their detractors that they are
more than just another pretty
face, but it is also enough to
prompt even their admirerers to
complain of the absence of
repeated brilliance.
Up until now, Jane Fonda has
had her "They Shoot Horses,
Don't They?," Mia Farrow her
"Rosemary's Baby," Stella
Stevens her "The Silencers,"
Katherine Ross her "The
Graduate" and Tuesday Weld her
"Pretty Poison" and though they
keep working, we'll be lucky to
see them that good again.
Perhaps the most luscious and
promising of them all, Jacqueline
Bisset, has had wide exposure in
"Bullitt" and "Airport," but
those films can hardly be
considered personal triumphs for
her.
