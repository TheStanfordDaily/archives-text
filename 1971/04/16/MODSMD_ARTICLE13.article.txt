# Ear-Boggling Boz Album
## 
### PROGRESS HORNSBY (Boz Scaggs, MOMENTS, Colombia C30454) 
Record reviewing is often like
trying to buy a good used car — it
may look good on the outside but
you can be sure it's rotten to the
core.
I'm happy to announce that
Boz Scaggs new album
"Moments" has a Chrysler Hemi
under the hood and a back seat
full of six-packs of good cheer; it's
got a chewy nougat center and a
delightful chocolate crust — its
tasty!
(Those highly impressionable
should read no further, for I will
play on your weakness, bend your
fevered brain with visions of the
powers and principalities of the
air, and persuade you to buy the
album so I can listen to it when I
drop by.)

The qualities that make this
music superior aren't really
quantifiable or even transferable.
The record reviewer facing this
insurmountable obstacle reaches
into his bag of tricks and produces
pages of sources and influences,
names of songs and sidemen,
witty generalizations and
penetrating insights that really
make only entertaining reading.
"Moments" is a masterpiece of
balance in all respects, and
reminds me of Van Morrison's
"Moondance" and the Dave
Mason "Alone Together" album.
Mason is generally smoother;
Scaggs shares "warm funky
spontaneity" with Morrison.
What sets all three apart from
the general pablum is that on each
record, different tracks show
different influences and attempt
different things; each track is
successful on its own, yet all
combine perfectly and naturally
to make a well balanced record.
All create and maintain an
illusion, aided by meticulous
attention to production and
arrangement details. The result, as
is all too seldom the case with
"carefully done" records, is a
feeling of inevitability and
simplicity without
overproduction.

It's that old balance again,
which makes music you don't get
tired of listening to. No special
effects come to mind, the horns
don't drown out everything, good
melodies are supported by a
strong rhythm section, the voices
are blended well, the music can be
played, played live, etc., etc.
This could go on endlessly, but
the important thing is that if Boz
'n the Band didn't like what they
were doing, they wouldn't take
the time to be careful craftsmen.
They are happy in their work, and
it makes you feel good to listen to
someone who likes himself and his
work.
HOCK ON
The performance by Chicago
and Madura (a three-man group
influenced by modern jazz) at
Maples Pavilion at 8 p.m. tonight
is sold out. However, if you're a
ticketless Chicago freak, you can
catch the group at the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium
tomorrow night (Bill Craham
thanks you), or at the University
of the Pacific on Sunday.
Fillmore West features Van
Morrison, the Isley Brothers, and
Fanny, a four-girl blues/rock band
which "Rolling Stone" has
described as a group you can
really get behind.
If you've often wondered how

it feels to be on the receiving end
of the Vulcan Mind Meld, don't
miss Grand Funk Railroad at
Winterland on Sunday night. Also
on the bill is Bloodrock, whose
song "D.0.A." explores the
metaphysical question of whether
there is rock after death.
