# Actors Succeed In Superb 'Woyzeck'
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Stanford Drama
Department redeemed a dreary
theatrical season Wednesday night
with a splendid production of
Georg Buchner's "Woyzeck."
The potent combination of
playwright Georg Buchner, a
gifted young man who tragically
died of typhus at the age of 23,
and director Stephen Rosenfield
who is also obviously gifted, has
given the Drama Department its
first real theatrical success in more
than a year.
To call "Woyzeck" a classic
would perhaps be resorting to
hyperbole, but it is certainly a
compelling piece of theater.
Buchner, a medical student
who wrote plays in his spare time,
got the idea for "Woyzeck" from
a paper he read in the Journal of
State Pharmaceutics, in which a
certain Dr. Clarus reported the
results of his examination of a

psychotic soldier who had
brutally murdered his mistress.
The soldier claimed that he was
visited by visions and voices, that
he heard the sounds of violins and
basses coming from the walls, and
that a voice spoke the words "on
and on" and "stab Mrs. Woost to
death."
Morbid And Sordid
It was a gruesome story, and
from it Buchner fashioned a play
that is hauntingly morbid, a
sordid, paranoiac nightmare that
gives the viewer the
uncomfortable feeling that he is
looking into the mind of a
madman.
Director Stephen Rosenfeld's
staging is as bizarre as Buchner's
play. The audience has moved
onto the stage of Memorial
Auditorium, where it sits on
rented football bleachers that
surround the acting area.

The proximity of the spectators
to the actors, the eerie effect of
being on stage, with ropes and
lights suspended from the grid 50
feet overhead moves you into the
play, so that the sordid atmosphere
envelopes you, and holds you.
Peter Silbert has the very
difficult part of Woyzeck, the
lunatic. It is difficult simply
because it is so easy to rave
without convincing us that the
madman is a human being with a
history and a personality.
Silbert handles this problem
effortlessly, giving us a man
trapped in a grotesque world of
his own creation, only a bit more
grotesque than the real world in
which he lives.
Bridget Ross plays Marie,

Woyzeck's mistress, with strength
and emotion, a thoroughly
convincint and entirely admirable
performance.
Ginger Drake, as a
Grandmother who tells nihilistic
nursery stories to children, Roger
Hardy as a brutal drum major,
Terry Hinz as a rather stupid
philosopher of a captain, and Bob
Bates as an ammoral, pre-Nazi
doctor, are all excellent.
It is a very short play (less than
80 minutes), it is not expensive
($2 top for students), and it is the
first Drama Department
production in a long time that I
can recommend with equal fervor
to my friends as well as to my
enemies. It is a fine show, and I
urge you to see it.


SOLD OUTâ€”Chicago will bring their own brand of horny rock to Maples Pavilion tonight at 8:00 pm but
unless you ve already purchased a ticket you'll be unable to hear them blow their horns. If you are one of
the fortunate 8,000 the producers of the show request that you walk in order to ease traffic problems.
They also request that you leave bottles or cans at home in order to prevent even more traffic problems and
also to save the pavilion's floor for future basketball (mis)fortunes. Gates will open at 6 :30 p.rn.
