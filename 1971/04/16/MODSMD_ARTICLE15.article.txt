### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
In a game of the two league
leaders, the Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club defeated the Stanford
Lacrosse team 6-4 last Saturday at
Stanford.
The visitors broke the ice with
two goals from mid field in the
first quarter.
The Card laxmen bounced back
as Stuart Childs and Butch
Hazelett tallied in the second
quarter. It looked as though
Stanford might take the lead
when Palo Alto netminder Bill
Riffle was visibly shaken.
However, the older and more
experienced Palo Alto stickmen
regained their poise and fought
back. Bruce Lloyd and Sam
Stadler combined to put the
visitors ahead 3-2 at halftime.
In the third quarter both teams
went scoreless. Despite several

Man-advantages and good ball
control the Indians were unable to
make the goals.
In the fourth and final frame
Stanford scored first. However,
Palo Alto came right back as the
Lloy d-Stadler combination
clicked again to put the visitors
ahead to stay. Dick Haberkon
tallied what proved to be the
winning goal to put the visitors
ahead by two goals.
Stanford still did not give up.
On a well-taken broken clear,
Tom Suen moved the Cards to
within a goal. But Haberkon's
second goal put the game out cf
reach for Stanford as they lost,
6-4.
Coach Bill Eakland hopes to
revamp his defense in preparation
for this weekend's encounters
against Claremont on Saturday
and Santa Barbara on Sunday.
