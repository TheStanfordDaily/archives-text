weekend as UCLA defeated the
Indians in dual meet competition
in Los Angeles, 108-37.
The powerful Bruins shut out
Stanford in the shot put, 100 yard
dash, 440 yard run, and both
relays. UCLA also rolled up its
amazing point total by taking first
and second places in the triple
jump, high jump, 880 yard run,
and the long jump.
Two top Indian performers,
Randy White and Rick Tipton,
provided the only bright moments
for Stanford as they took first
places in the 440 yard
intermediate hurdles and the high
hurdles.
Randy White faced Wayne
Collett, America's fastest
quartermiler in 1970, in the 440
yard hurdles and set a new
Stanford record of 51.2 to take
first. Collett spurted off to an
early lead but White caught him at
the 220 yard mark and pulled
away as Collett faded to a 52.9
finishing time.

Mark Haight finished third
behind Collett with the time of
53.6 to add to Stanford's point
total.
Rick Tipton proved last
Saturday that he has fully
recovered from the leg injuries he
incurred last year by equalling his
lifetime best performance in the
120 yard high hurdles with a 13.9
Tom Long also turned in his
best time in the high hurdles to tie
for second behind Tipton with
McNeil of the Bruins as both
runners were clocked in 14.5.
Casey Carrigan placed second in
the pole vault, clearing the bar at
16-6. Arvid Kretz and Bernie
Lahde ran well in the two mile to
take second and third, and Don
Kardong and Duncan Mac Donald
finished 2-3 in the mile run.
