# Spring Drills Begin
## 
### 
Stanford's football team will
begin spring practice at 9:30 a.m.
tomorrow morning. Over 130
candidates are expected to vie for
positions on next fall's defending
Rose Bowl champion team.
21 lettermen are gone from last
year's team including Heisman
Trophy winner Jim Plunkett, but
Coach John Ralston will still have
a total of 34 lettermen to work
with this year. The 34
letterwinners will be joined by 8
junior college transfers.
Maturally the biggest question
mark is the quarterback position
left vacant by the departure of
Plunkett. The leading candidate
will be Don Bunce, who played
behind Plunkett in both the '68
and '69 campaigns.

Bunce, who was redshirted
during the 1970 season, is an
excellent option quarterback, who
runs almost as well as he passes.
Ralston says, "Bunce has a unique
ability to sprint out and look for
daylight, and he can drive a
defense crazy with his great
versatility."
Leading sophomore candidates
will include running back John
Winesberry (who might be moved
to flanker), linebacker Gordon
Riegel, defensive back Max
Goldstein, flanker Rufus Shaw,
quarterback Mike Gilyard, and
giant offensive tackle, Ruben
Monmouth (6-3, 260).
Spring practice will culminate
with the annual Red and White
scrimmage in Stanford Stadium
on May 15th at 2:00 p.m.
