# Indians Nip UOP, 1-0, Set for Big Weekend
## 
### ROB MARKS 
Five pitchers combined efforts
to shut out the University of
Pacific, 1-0, in a game played
Tuesday on the Sunken Diamond.
The Indians, now 26-10 on the
year, scored the only run of the
game in the third inning when
pinch hitter Dick Borchers
reached first on an error and
scored on two more errors. Dan
Shaw, who started and went three
innings, got credit for the victory,
his eighth against three losses.
The baseballers travel south for
a Friday game with UCLA and a
Saturday double header with USC
in their first big weekend of
league action. "We're looking
forward to this trip," said Coach
Ray Young. "I think this team
showed how good it is in the
Riverside Tournament, and we're
ready to play anybody."
Coach Young has good reason
for his optimism. The team is
batting over .270, its highest mark
in several years. Sophomore
outfielder Rod Boone is the
leading hitter with a .409 average
and 32 RBl's, while freshmen
Mark Lucich (.364) and A 1

O'Brien (.292) have also
contributed greatly to the attack.
The pitching, supposedly the
weakest part of the team, has
been consistently good. The staff
has already thrown 10 shutouts
this year, and the earned run
averages of Bob Kammayer, Dan
Shaw, and Tom Schoen, the three
starters this weekend, are 2.33,
1.35, 0.95, respectively. This is
very important for the team's
success in Los Angeles, for the
stadiums are smaller than
Stanford's and the pitchers must
keep the ball down to be
successful.
Finally, the defense, has been
improving over the last few weeks
and has become a steadying
influence to such a young team.
This, in turn, has helped the
pitching considerably.
Physically, the team will be in
great shape for these three key
games. Only catcher Bob Reece,
with a pulled hamstring muscle, is
ailing, and Coach Young expects
him to see some action over the
weekend. All in all, it could be a
very big weekend for the Indians
title chances, both the Pac-8 and
NCAA.


DEFENDING CHAMP-Jeff Borowiak, defending NCAA champion,
will play Stanford freshman Alex Mayer today in second singles. I he
Uclans whipped the Indians in their first meeting this year, 8-1. Ihe
undefeated Bruins are the top team in the country coming into this
match.
