# McHenry, Zero $$$ Win
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The presidential slate of
Mcllenry-Fields won a narrow victory
over the opposing ticket of
Hocker-Friedman last night, by a
majority of 2061 to 1881. A small
crowd was present in the Cedro dining
hall where the results were being
tabulated when the success of the $0
student fee assessment was announced,
2203 votes to 1835 over the $3 fee.
The passage of a $0 fee may not last
for long. Bob Grant announced he
would begin circulating petitions
tomorrow for a special election on a
student fee of $1 per quarter next year.
The money would be apportioned
according to the budget proposition
passed a week ago.
Adjourn The Senate
A second measure on the ballot
would adjourn the ASSU Senate for the
remainder of the quarter. This has been
prompted chiefly by a recent vote of
the Senate to transfer all money out of
the ASSU reserve fund.
A by-law passed in last week's
election stipulates that no funds may
be taken out of this fund except by a
vote of the student body.

Sponsors of the bill had intended to
supply the ASSU Senate with funds
which it could appropriate during next
year, in order to prepare for the
possibility of the $0 fee being passed.
They claimed that results of the
student election had not been officially
certified. However, the bill has been
vetoed by Pat Shea.
Chris Hocker, who had surprised
himself by even reaching the run-off
election, was not discouraged. "I think
for anyone of my political persuasion
to pull with 180 votes of winning is
very satisfying," he said. The success of
the $0 assessment was an indication to
him that "no one really needed the
ASSU."
Speculation
A considerable amount of
speculation was offered to explain the
defeat of the $3 fee, which had been
heavily endorsed by the winning
McHenry-Fields ticket.
Doug McHenry commented that
"people were getting back at the
Senate" for attempting to tum over to
themselves the money in the reserve
fund.
Campaign manager for the winning

ticket, Henry Sayre, said the drive for
$0 was "probably the best campaign
I've ever seen run at this school." He
added that people would have been
more interested in voting for $1 or $2
dollars.
Members of the new Council of
Presidents have in common a wide
political experience, in and out of
Stanford. McHenry, a sophomore, and
a two-year veteran of the ASSU Senate,
took part in Stanford-in-Washington
last summer, where he worked on
obtaining the vote for citizens of the
District of Columbia. He is also a
member of the Trustee Committee on
Land Development.
Diane Fields, a junior, who was a
pompon dolly, is a member of the
ASSU Senate. Ann Kimball, also a
junior, has also been a member of the
senate and is presently on the
Committee of Fifteen.
The slate's fourth member, Larry-
Diamond, a sophomore, was the
precinct manager for Stu McLean's
unsuccessful congressional race last fall,
and is presently a member of the
Committee on Undergraduate
Admissions.
The results of the balloting for three
places on the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) will not be
ready for several days, pending their
compilation by computer.
