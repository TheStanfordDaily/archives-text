Road To Peking
WASHINGTON — The latest U.S. move toward improving
relations with Peking came Wednesday when Nixon
announced the United States will speed up admittance visas
for Chinese who want to come here from the mainland. He
also lifted a number of restraints on trade and currency
exchange with Communist China.
Mainland China may be interested in developing trade
and gaining access to American technology. But no
responsible official here is willing to do more at the
moment than admit the possibility.
Nixon said prophetically in his "state of the world
message" last February: "The past four years have been a
period of internal turmoil and upheaval in mainland China.
A calmer mood now seems to be developing."
ARVN Track NV
SAIGON — South Vietnamese troops under a U.S. air
umbrella launched a drive in the central highlands
yesterday against North Vietnamese forces who have been
on the attack there for 15 days.

In a push through the jungle-covered mountains, the
South Vietnamese were trying to track down and destroy a
regiment of North Vietnamese regulars on the southern
sector of the highland front.
They were backed up by an array of U.S.
fighter-bombers, fast-firing helicopter gunships, and
long-range artillery.
Lettuce Suit Fails
SAN FRANCISCO — A federal judge has dismissed a
$240 million law suit brought by the United Farm Workers
Organizing Committee (UFWOC) against growers and
shippers of solid head lettuce.
U.S. District Court Judge Alfonso J. Zirpoli ruled
Wednesday the farm workers' triple-damages suit was
invalid because they did not establish that growers and
shippers directly conspired to reduce their job
opportunities.
A counterclaim for $30 million in triple damages filed
by Bud Antle, Inc., against UFWOC and Inter Harvest, Inc.,
is still pending. That suit accuses the defendants of
attempting to monopolize the lettuce business in Southern
California's Imperial Valley.
