18 from 1:30 to 5 :0 0 p.m. on the Manzanita central lawn.
All proceeds beyond cost for materials and labor for the
sale of salables will go to the Nairobi College Library
Committee, which is co-sponsoring the fair along with
Columbae House.
Music by Steve Jubb's band and a volleyball tournament
will highlight the afternoon. "The Three Cuckolds," a
Commedia dell'Arte play, will be performed at 3 :00 .
Students are welcome to sell candles, art, wrapped

baked goods, crafts, etc. Donations will be asked for food
and drinks.
Nairobi College attempts to offer a relevant education to
people of color who might otherwise be unable to afford to
attend college.
No Layoffs?
"It now appears possible to avoid lay-off actions at this
time," Physical Plant Director Elbridge Bacon, Jr. has told
employees here.
In February, Bacon estimated that as many as 16
workers might lose their jobs, but a combination of
transfers, terminations and a seasonal increase in work now
has changed this outlook.
"If the seasonal work demand continues, there is a good
prospect that sufficient work will be available to avoid
lay-off actions," Bacon said.
"The longer-range prospects are for a lessened work
schedule in the department, but by taking advantage of
continuing turnover, it should be possible to achieve the
proper work force level," he said.
