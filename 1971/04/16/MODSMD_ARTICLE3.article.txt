# Discrimination Case Postponed Until May
## 
### 
The Cross vs. Stanford preliminary
injunction hearing regarding Stanford's
alleged sex discrimination was
postponed today when San .Jose
Superior Court Judge Homer
Thompson granted a continuance of
the case to May 7 at 9 a.m.
The continuance was gr nted shortly
after San Jose Superior Court Judge
Edward L. Brady stepped out of the
case. Dr. Cross asked for Judge Brady's
recusation earlier yesterday morning
because of his affiliation with "all
white, male organizations:" The Rotary
Club, The Benevolent and Protective
Order of El s, The Independent Order
of Oddfellows, Veterans of Foreign
Wars, American Legion and the
Commonwealth Club.
She also asked for his recusation on
the grounds that Judge Brady is a
graduate of Stanford's law school, a
"sexist institution."
Although Judge Brady didn't
express agreement with Dr. Cross'
allegations he said he would take
several days to reply. "Recognizing the
great degree of immediacy involved in

this mailer and the interest of Stanford
students, I accept the disqualification."
The case then moved to Judge
Thompson's court. The continuance
was granted after Dr. Cross stated that
she was unable to procure
cross-examination witnesses on such a
short notice. Among the witnesses she
intends to question is Stanford's
Provost W. Miller.
Although Stanford may have already
sent acceptance noitces to next year's
freshman class, Dr. Cross believes the
alleged "discriminatory patterns" in
admissions can still be stopped. The
class is projected to be 4 0 percent
female and 6 0 percent male.
"The University is obliged to respect
the law," Cross pointed out. "They
Knew about this case on Saturday, so if
they sent out acceptance notices on
Monday it's their fault."
One of the goals the plaintiffs hope
to achieve is equal admission for all
qualified individuals. "We aren't
looking for a 50 -50 ratio," explained
Linda Crouse. "We're looking for no
ratio limitations at all."
