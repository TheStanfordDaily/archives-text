# Sit-ins Outlawed As Incorrect Political Action
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
University sit-ins are "not an
acceptable form of political action
within the University" and "will be
brought to an end as soon as
possible ..." President Richard Lyman
told the Faculty Senate yesterday.
In outlining official policy regarding
sit-ins "on which there has been
persistent unclarity" Lyman declared
that "when a sit-in occurs, it will be
brought to an end as soon as possible,
using the best judgment as to methods
and timing that can be brought to bear
on the circumstances of the particular
case."
Lyman indicated that a formal
statement was necessary because of
confusion over University policy after
last Friday's sit-in in the Stanford
Hospital's administrative offices.
"It is not in anyone's interest to have
people engage in an activity under a
false set of expectations about the
results to which that activity may
lead," Lyman said.
He emphasized that "the application
of any policy of this kind will be
tempered by the circumstances in
which it must be applied." But, he
continued, "this policy is a necessary
part of the conception of the
University as a place of reason, not
force."
Noting that this policy "is quite
similar to policies in existence at some
other major universities," Lyman
explained that this premise has "guided
University policy since the Encina Hall
sit-in of 1969 ..."
Lyman briefly explained the threats
to records that "could not be
tolerated" in the Encina sit-in and the
two spring 1970 sit-ins.
Maintaining that the calling of police
to end the Medical Center sit-in "was
wholly consistent" with this policy, he
said that the timing was "inevitably
shaped by the circumstances of the
particular east . In spite of assertions to
the contrary since the event, it was
only when it became clear that the sole
remaining issueâ€”the immediate
reinstatement of Sam Bridges-could

not be resolved and that the sit-in was
to continue that they decided to call
the police," Lyman said.
He emphasized that as "a very large
majority of students, faculty, and staff
at Stanford recognize . . . every sit-in is
intended as an act of coercion, based
on either force or the threat of force."
In answer to faculty questions
Lyman said that SJC proceedings may
be brought against the "very few"
students involved in the Medical Center
sit-in.
He noted that the demonstration was
started "largely by outsiders, including
a fair number of white radicals not
connected with the University." He

said that it would bo "tragedy piled on
tragedy" for the University to falter
now in its commitments to "deal with
the results of a long history of
discrimination against ethnic
minorities."
Acknowledging that "progress
toward racial harmony has been dealt a
series of blows in recent weeks," he
said an "earnest, sustained" effort is
now in progress to resolve differences
at the hospital, but "there's a very great
distance we still have to travel," both as
a University and a society.
Lyman emphasized during the three
hour meeting that Provost William
Miller had been "extremely reluctant to

ask for police assistance precisely
because it was a hospital that was being
occupied."
Acting Dean John L. Wilson of the
Medical School explained to the faculty
group that by Thursday midnight of
the sit-in he told the group that "I
considered their presence there
prejudicial to the care of patients and I
advised them urgently to go."
While "there wasn't any clear failure
to patients" during the sit-in, "the
threat was very definitely perceived by
patients and their relatives" and "there
was a very definite reduction in the
capacity of the institution to respond
to the needs of patients," Dr. Wilson
said.
