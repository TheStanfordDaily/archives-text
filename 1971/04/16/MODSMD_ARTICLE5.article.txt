# Receives Enthusiastic Support
## Semana Affirms La Raza Unida 
### KIM McCALL 
With searing theater, hopeful song and enthusiastic
shouts of "Viva la Raza," events of the MECHA-sponsored
Semana Cultural entered their next to last day yesterday.
The action started with guerilla theater presented bv
Teatro Popular from Cal State Long Beach. Alternating
dramatic scenes with music written by group members,
they addressed themes including racism in the American
judicial system, manipulation of Chicanos by political
parties, exploitation in the armed forces, and the need lor
Chicant) unity.
Voicing a personal appeal, one performer sang his own
words, "Let's join as one, work together with our heads
held toward the sun. We'll take a stand so we can survive.
He was followed by a powerful tragicomedy on the draft
and the army, emphasizing the humiliation and
exploitation suffered by Chicanos at the hands ot the
military. Two happy-go-lucky Chicanos are forced to fight
in Vietnam. As they go to make peace with the Viet Cong.
Uncle Sam comes up behind him, yells, "I want you, and
shoots one of them. The other soldier goes to sleep, and
when he wakes up he turns to tell his Iriend about his
strange dream and finds him dead.
The themes of strength through unity and revolution
were stressed throughout the activities which focus on the
plight of La Raza and what it means to be a Chicano in
America. One was continually impressed by the enthusiasm
and unity shared by the actors and the audience.

Attending and responding enthusiastically to the Teatro
were 300 Chicano high school students. Afterwards they
met in Cubberly to listen to Dr. Jose Aguilar and Jose
Razo, Chairman of MECHA. Later they broke into
seminars and after discussion took tours of the campus.
Said one student, "It was good. You never see so many
Chicano students together in the high schools."
Later last night a crowd at Mem Chu was entertained
and instructed by the Teatro de la Calavera, one part of a
theater group which originated in the grape fields of
Delano. It addressed the problems of the Chicano in
education, the business world, the military, and on the
farm.
Salvador Lopez, a MECHA mqmber who organized the
Semana Cultural or cultural week, said that there were
several reasons for the activities. The primary purpose is to
"educate the Chicano that he has a culture to be proud of,"
Lopez said.
According to Lopez, it should also educate the
University to a sense of the Chicano culture and
community and inform Chicanos outside Stanford about
the resources available to and the problems confronting
Chicanos here.
Today at noon the Semana will feature a Marimba band
from Roosevelt High in Fresno at White Plaza, and the
week's festivities will finish with a performance of the Balet
Folklorico de Estudiantil de Lincoln High School at 7 :30 at
Mem Chu followed by a Chicano dance from 10 to 1 at the
Women's Clubhouse.
