I would like the Stanford Community to be
aware of what I consider to be a serious threat to
the well-being of the community.
It has become the standard procedure during
periods of campus unrest for those who desire to
disrupt campus procedure to pull the fire alarm
boxes. Let me assure you that neither Dick Nixon,
Pres. Lyman or the Trustees of Stanford are
disrupted by this. What does occur is the protection
of life and property at Stanford is put in jeopardy.
J An example of this occured last night, April 12.
A serious car accident occured on Interstate 280
,\vhich required immediate first aid and rescue
operations. Stanford Fire Dept. responded to the
scene and was involved in a desperate attempt to
Jsave the lives of trapped people. Several times the
•operation was disrupted by a series of false alarms
ipulled on campus.
J This is merely one example of the type of
■situation in which other peoples' lives can be put in
jeopardy by the unthinking actions of others. I hope
|we can become more aware as a community in
dealing with each others' lives. Peace.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In the years I have been involved in budget
making, I have never seen a budget allocation made
with any regard for the real needs of the
organization or the number of students that
organization services.
In the 1970-71 budget deliberations, I was faced
with the possible passage of a budget that would
have allocated 60% of all fees to only three
organizations and the remaining funds to a very few
other groups. There is no need to mention which
groups would have devoured such enormous
portions. The only reason this budget did not pass
was the presence of 16 senate votes which were
mustered together to bargain for a fairer budget.
Remember though, it was only a bargain.
This year we don't have those votes. I don't see
any hope for more moderate votes next year either.
The Senate has this year, (like every year) shown
itself to be unscrupulous, unpopular, and unethical.
Although people now speak in soft tones about
responsible budgeting and serving students, that
song will soon be forgotten, as will you, in the
budget-making process.
