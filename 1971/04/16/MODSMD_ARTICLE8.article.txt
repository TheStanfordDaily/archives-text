# Political Crises Expected
## Foreign Rush for S.E. Asian Oil 
### 
Dispatch News Service

Singapore — Behind the buffer
of the Indochina War, American,
Japanese and international oil
companies are moving
determinedly into Southeast Asia
with hopes of exploiting what
may prove to be the world's
largest offshore oil reserves.
Indonesian offshore oil
exploration, so far involving 25
concession contracts with foreign
oil enterprises, has yielded several
strikes. Independent Indonesia
American Petroleum Company, a
subsidiary of the San
Francisco-based Natmas
corporation, is now beginning to
produce Indonesia's first offshore
oil from coastal waters southeast
of Sumatra.
Other Southeast Asian
countries have negotiated with
foreign oil firms for much of their
continental shelves. Malaysia has
let much of its shelf to American,
Japanese; and French companies.
Cambodia, which let a large part
of its shelf to the French combine
Elf Union just before the
overthrow of Sihanouk, will see
off-shore drilling within the year
according to a company

spokesman. Burma has begun
offshore oil exploration with West
German involvement in the form
of an aid agreement for offshore
development. Negotiations with
Japanese oil concerns are reported
underway but moving slowly.
Thai Shelf Let
In Thailand, the government
has tentatively let the entire Thai
continental shelf area in the Gulf
of Siam. In addition, two
concessions have been let in the
Northeast, in sensitive areas
adjoining the Laos border, and
another let in the area
surrounding Bangkok.
Finalization of contracts and
drilling waits on the Thai
legislature's passage of oil laws,
expected this year.
Saigon's legislature passed
South Vietnam's first petroleum
exploitation and exploration
legislation in late November.
According to oilmen in Singapore,
40 international oil concerns will
soon bid on 18 concessions
totalling 90,000 square miles.
Singapore, with its pivotal
position on the Middle East-Japan
sea route and central location
relative to Southeast Asian oil
fields and markets, appears slated
to be regional capital for the oil
industry's Southeast Asian
empire. By U.S. Embassy
reckoning 33 American firms
involved in petroleum exploration
are now in Singapore, having
invested $12.1 million as of
mid-January.
Why The Rush 1
According to geologists
involved in oil exploration out of
Singapore, the potential of
Southeast Asia's oil reserves has
been anticipated at least since the
early 1950'5, although serious
activity did not start here until
1966. The question thus arises:
why the sudden rush? According
to the U.S. Assistant Secretary for

Economic Affairs, Philip H.
Tresize, "we have a short-range
fuel and energy problem .. . "
Even with development of
Alaskan reserves, current U.S.
production of 10 billion barrels a
day could not expand to meet
demand in 1980. Thus, more oil is
likely to be imported.
The major market for
Southeast Asian oil, however,
appears to be Japan, 90% of
whose oil imports now come from
the Mid East and whose
petroleum needs are expected to
rise over 300% in the next 15
years.
Political Crises
Prospects for large profits from
the development and exploitation
of Southeast Asian oil are good.
For this very reason political
crises can be expected as the firms
of many nations scramble for oil
concessions.
As drilling is about to begin in
Cambodia, for example,
continental shelf boundary

disputes exist with Thailand and
Vietnam. Further south, the
continental shell boundary between
Thailand and Malaysia is not
officially settled. And, between
the Phillippines and Malaysia
there is a long-standing feud over
who should own Sarawak and the
Palapan Island. Only Malaysia and
Indonesia have settled all their
continental shelf boundary
problems.
In Vietnam there is the very
real problem of how oil
development will influence the
war and just how many lives will
be lost keeping the country at
least safe enough for offshore oil
concession. The Provisional
Revolutionary Government of the
NLF announced Feb. 23 it would
not recognize oil agreements made
by Saigon. The search for offshore
oil is indeed one of the biggest
things happening to Southeast
Asia today. But it augurs
problems for the future as greai or
greater than any in the history of
the region.

expected this year.
Saigon's legislature passed
South Vietnam's first petroleum
exploitation and exploration
legislation in late November.
According to oilmen in Singapore,
40 international oil concerns will
soon bid on 18 concessions
totalling 90,000 square miles.
Singapore, with its pivotal
position on the Middle East-Japan
sea route and central location
relative to Southeast Asian oil
fields and markets, appears slated
to be regional capital for the oil
industry's Southeast Asian
empire. By U.S. Embassy
reckoning 33 American firms
involved in petroleum exploration
are now in Singapore, having
invested $12.1 million as of
mid-January.
Why The Rush 1
According to geologists
involved in oil exploration out of
Singapore, the potential of
Southeast Asia's oil reserves has
been anticipated at least since the
early 1950'5, although serious
activity did not start here until
1966. The question thus arises:
why the sudden rush? According
to the U.S. Assistant Secretary for

Economic Affairs, Philip H.
Tresize, "we have a short-range
fuel and energy problem .. . "
Even with development of
Alaskan reserves, current U.S.
production of 10 billion barrels a
day could not expand to meet
demand in 1980. Thus, more oil is
likely to be imported.
The major market for
Southeast Asian oil, however,
appears to be Japan, 90% of
whose oil imports now come from
the Mid East and whose
petroleum needs are expected to
rise over 300% in the next 15
years.
Political Crises
Prospects for large profits from
the development and exploitation
of Southeast Asian oil are good.
For this very reason political
crises can be expected as the firms
of many nations scramble for oil
concessions.
As drilling is about to begin in
Cambodia, for example,
continental shelf boundary

disputes exist with Thailand and
Vietnam. Further south, the
continental shell boundary between
Thailand and Malaysia is not
officially settled. And, between
the Phillippines and Malaysia
there is a long-standing feud over
who should own Sarawak and the
Palapan Island. Only Malaysia and
Indonesia have settled all their
continental shelf boundary
problems.
In Vietnam there is the very
real problem of how oil
development will influence the
war and just how many lives will
be lost keeping the country at
least safe enough for offshore oil
concession. The Provisional
Revolutionary Government of the
NLF announced Feb. 23 it would
not recognize oil agreements made
by Saigon. The search for offshore
oil is indeed one of the biggest
things happening to Southeast
Asia today. But it augurs
problems for the future as greai or
greater than any in the history of
the region.

Singapore — Behind the buffer
of the Indochina War, American,
Japanese and international oil
companies are moving
determinedly into Southeast Asia
with hopes of exploiting what
may prove to be the world's
largest offshore oil reserves.
Indonesian offshore oil
exploration, so far involving 25
concession contracts with foreign
oil enterprises, has yielded several
strikes. Independent Indonesia
American Petroleum Company, a
subsidiary of the San
Francisco-based Natmas
corporation, is now beginning to
produce Indonesia's first offshore
oil from coastal waters southeast
of Sumatra.
Other Southeast Asian
countries have negotiated with
foreign oil firms for much of their
continental shelves. Malaysia has
let much of its shelf to American,
Japanese; and French companies.
Cambodia, which let a large part
of its shelf to the French combine
Elf Union just before the
overthrow of Sihanouk, will see
off-shore drilling within the year
according to a company

spokesman. Burma has begun
offshore oil exploration with West
German involvement in the form
of an aid agreement for offshore
development. Negotiations with
Japanese oil concerns are reported
underway but moving slowly.
Thai Shelf Let
In Thailand, the government
has tentatively let the entire Thai
continental shelf area in the Gulf
of Siam. In addition, two
concessions have been let in the
Northeast, in sensitive areas
adjoining the Laos border, and
another let in the area
surrounding Bangkok.
Finalization of contracts and
drilling waits on the Thai
legislature's passage of oil laws,
expected this year.
