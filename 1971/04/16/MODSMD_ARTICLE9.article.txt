# Independent Units Join University Housing System
## 
### CARLA KALLAN 
Next fall, one fraternity, Phi
Sigma Kappa, and five currently
independent living groups, ZAP,
ATO, Lambda Nu, Columbae, and
Jordan Co-op, will become part of
the University housing system,
according to Larry Horton,
assistant dean of students for
housing.
In the past, the independent
houses involved have leased their
facilities from the university on a
yearly basis. Nonetheless, the
university has maintained as much
legal authority over these
residences as it holds over the
dormatories. "The real truth of
the matter," explained Horton,
"is that all the houses on campus
exist with an extraordinary degree
of autonomy."
The proposed changes will not
violate the independent statures
of the houses, Horton feels. "Our
system is sophisticated enough
that it really does meet special
needs," Horton said.
Frat Seeks Flexibility
The fraternity joined the
housing draw system, according to
Horton, to allow more flexibility
for its members and potential
members. "It is one of the
strongest" fraternities, he claims,
and has found that the best
indication of potential members is
an expression that they wish to
join the house.
Therefore, in order to be
considered for the house someone
must sign a letter indicating
interest in Phi Sigma Kappa.
Agreements have been
negotiated with each group so
that they can participate in the
general draw while still preserving

specific requirements for
admittance. These requirements
(such as visiting the house twice as
a display of sincere interest) must
be mutually agreed upon by the
house and the Dean of Students
Office. Besides setting objective
standards, the five living groups
will continue to select their own
house managers and control the
kitchen.
Year Contract Required
The greatest change will be that
students entering ZAP, ATO, or
any of the other houses, will be
obligated to sign a one-year
contract with the housing office,
as dorm residents do now. This
will discourage "frivolous
moving" that may leave the
university paying excess rent, and
prevent facilities from becoming
"transient billets."
Horton believes the system will
give each student a greater
opportunity to attain the housing
of his choice. Within the
university system, the student can
transfer to other facilities through
mutual contractual relationships.
"Free flow throughout the
residence system is a tremendous
advantage," Horton noted. "It
could have prevented the
difficulties ATO and ZAP had in
filling vacancies this spring."
Opposition
For all its advantages, the
proposed innovations initially met
with fierce opposition. Jordan,
ATO, and Lambda Nu members
feared that housing alternatives
were being pared down. They also
felt that continuity within the
houses would be disrupted if
current residents drew poor

numbers in the university draw
and were forced out.
Horton interprets this response
as a distrust of anything proposed
by the university administration, a
sort of "constructive paranoia."
"I know that there is no design to
crush the independence of living
groups," he said. "I am keenly
aware that all the good things that
happen at residences happen with
the students themselves, not on
the third floor of the Old Union.
There is no such thing as an
administrative ego that wants to
somehow do something bad to
students."
He called student attitudes
"wholly unjust" and based more
on hearsay than on personal
experience. "It is clearly in the
best interest of the university to
maintain successful living groups,"
he emphasized. "And as long as it
devotes resources to the $8
million housing operation, it must
have a voice in it."
