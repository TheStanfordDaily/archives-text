# Old Time Religion Comes Back
## 
### JIM DEERINGER DOYLE McMANUS News Feature 
"... I figured there must be more to life than this.
And then I noticed many people around me who
seemed to be peaceful, loving, and sensitive. And 1
found that these people called themselves Christians."
They call themselves Christians. Some call
themselves 'Street Christians'; some, 'Jesus People,'
the 'Jesus Movement.' They have been widely labeled
'Jesus Freaks.' "Christ is alive," they affirm, and they
have sought—and found—a personal relationship with
Him.
Their presence here is manifest in various ways,
but it is unquestionably growing. They work through
no less than five organizations—Campus Crusade for
Christ, Christian World Liberation Front, Young Life
Campaign, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Fellowship of Christian Athletes-each with a
somewhat different approach, but all with great
common ground.
Almost 300 of them gather every Sunday morning
at Geology corner for "Seminar 70," a
service-cum-study meeting. Nearly one-third are
non-students. The noisy throng encompasses a wide
range of people: athletes, ex-drugheads, freshmen,
radicals, street people, long-time 'Christians,' and,
according to minister David Roper, "even some
Catholics." It appears to be as much a social event
among friends as a religious service. There are several
Orientals, a few Chicanos, no blacks.
The 'Family'
The 'family' is welcomed by a young campus
ministry intern; a few prayers are said, a guitarist

leads a religious folk-song or two, and then the floor
is turned over to anyone in the audience who has a
'Christian' experience to share.
A student stands up almost immediately. He is a
freshman, a 'new Christian'; lank blond hair falls to
his shoulders. He begins to speak gravely but
animatedly of his experience: while walking through
the Economics department, he dropped his new
glasses. Upon retrieving them, he discovered that an
infintesimal screw had fallen out onto the floor.
Despite the aid of two passing students and a
professor, who crawled about for some time seeking
the elusive screw, it remained lost.
The audience listens more attentively now as the
story approaches its climax. Frustrated, despairing, he
called on God for help; a bit of light on the floor
caught his eye; his screw was found.
Experience
Some in the audience nod; many smile knowingly.
A Christian experience. A visiting minister calls it
"heartening" to find such faith in a new Christian.
The young intern rejoins with an account of how God
helped him find his contact lens when he thought he
had dropped it down the drain. Praise the Lord.
Seminars fill the remainder of the hour, and the
'family' parts with a short prayer. Many go on to
attend another hour-long service at the Peninsula
Bible Church in Menlo Park.
They gather, too, at Tresidder on certain
weeknights under the auspices of Campus Crusade for
Christ. Here at "College Life" the format is much the
same, but there are only thirty people attending—but
"Usually we have about a hundred," one girl assures
me.
A speaker attempts to prove the divinity of Christ.

"Jesus will tell you now .. . You can know for
sure—after praying to Jesus."
And again come the testimonies. "I was lost . . . 1
was confused . . . then 1 accepted Christ into my
life." One girl chooses to sing:
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
Growth
Perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the Jesus
movement today is its growth. Soon after Seminar 70
moved on campus last year, attendance jumped from
under 175 to a figure approaching 300. Says one
intern, a former Stanford student: "Whatever we're
doing, it works."
A good part of what they're doing is
proselytizing—in the streets, in the dorms, on White
Plaza, and through meetings like Seminar 70 and
College Life. They are contacting every freshman on
campus to present their message. Members are urged
to apply for sponsor positions, particularly in
freshman dorms. Almost any sunny afternoon two or
three of them can be found sitting at the tables
outside Tresidder. "Christ said, 'Go into all the world
and rap with people," one told us.
David Roper feels that the Christian movement has
become popular on campus recently for several
reasons. According to Roper, the existentialism that
reigns on campus has caused despair, a "spiritual
hunger." There is a great desire for 'community,'
owing partly to the impersonality of student life here
and partly to the breakdown of the traditional family
structure. "People are looking for acceptance," says


THE IMAGE—The Jesus look has suffered through occasional and relative fads
over the millenia, but the message remains the same. Current patois has tabbed
loyalists as "Jesus Freaks." While the freaks may reflect the image, it seems to be
contagious these days.
Bill Tankersley, an intern with the campus ministry.
Many find in this 'Christian family' the warmth and
immediate acceptance they seek.
Roper explains the Jesus movement also as a
reaction to the lifeless institutionalized religion of the
1950'5. "There were a lot of nominal Christians in the
50's; they weren't vocal. Most people were still
enamored with science and technology. But now
we're seeing a return to humanism."
Many drug addicts have found the Jesus people's
appeal irresistible. The movement's literature is
replete with accounts of hopeless addicts finding
salvation in Jesus.
Jesus people tend to be defensive about the
prohibitions of the conventional morality that is an
integral part of their religion. They declare that their
"love for Jesus" negates any desire to sin; they
condemn the relativity of moral codes that shift with
the times, and advocate a return to the, absolute
mores that they find in Christ's teachings.
Explicitly political statements rarely issue from
their mouths. Their desire to avoid the power
relationships of politics is well expressed in their
position on the Indochina war: that harmony is to be
achieved on earth when enough of the world's people
accept Christ into their lives.
"The heart of man is the cause of war," says Jerry
Wyatt, a Campus Crusade intern. "You change
enough people, you change society."
Religious-political activism, such as that seen in the
case of the Berrigan brothers, is frowned upon.
"They're using religion as a cop-out, as an excuse,"
Wyatt adds.
Considerable tension has developed between the
Jesus Movement and some of the more liberal
elements of the Stanford religious community,
notably Dean B. David Napier. The disagreement
concerns several fundamental issues.

In a sermon last year, Napier charged that groups
such as Seminar 70 display a "mania for simplicity"
that induces them "to ignore the complexities and
some of the contradictions of the Gospel."
Dave Roper provides probably the most eloquent
statement of the "back to Christ" position. "The
basic facts of the Gospel are simple," says Roper.
"The refusal of people to bend their wills hangs them
up. What seems too simple is the authority out there.
There is a reluctance to accept this authority."
Criticism
Probably the most significant criticism of the Jesus
people is that they often seek a personal relationship
with Christ to the detriment of their brothers and
sisters on the earth. Says Napier, "Their varied
performances address, in effect, the same subject—the
salvation of the individual. Heal me. Accept me just
as I am. Help me be successful, integrated,
victorious. . . not my brother, not my sister; not my
neighbor. . . not justice and love, not black and
white, oppressed and oppressor, slave and free,
starving and stuffed—nothing but me, Lord, and
thee . . . just me and thee!"
Roper dismisses political or social action programs
as "robbed of spontaneity. The commitment must be
personal," he states. Roper maintains that a change in
orientation from the self outward (through Christ)
must precede any personal commitment.
"The last 50 years have seen a radical division
between the liberals and conservatives in the Christian
Church," he continues. "The liberals have
de-emphasized regeneration, redemption, and the
relationship with Christ" in favor of social action. "It
has to be both—and," he concluded. "It's not good
works, but the commitment to Christ that is essential.
One lives the rest of his life in the light of that
decision as Christ works out his lordship in a bigger
and bigger area of your life."

Some people are put off by the apparent
exclusiveness of membership in the "Christian"
family. There are several known cases of genuine love
relationships that have been broken up by the
"Christian" involved because the other would not
accept Christ in the same terms.
States one freshman who says he has asked Christ
into his life, "I sometimes get the impression that
they're doing the opposite of what they preach. They
seem to have an attitude of 'I'm better than you are
because I've received God."
Napier shares this criticism and stresses the
universality of the Christ event. "No man passes the
judgment of damnation on any of his brothers and
sisters anywhere, nor does he withhold himself from
companionship within the great human family,"
states Napier.
Despite the apparent radical and favorable
transformation of many Jesus people through their
relationships with Christ, Napier contends that they
are ignoring many of the realities of our present
human condition. He concludes, "I wonder just how
long the delusion can last."
Whether a delusion or not, the Jesus Movement
appears to be a product of relativism, of uncertainty,
of troubled times. It provides for many a viable
answer to the problem of living in a chaotic
world—regeneration through the person of Jesus
Christ.
Praise the Lord.

Perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the Jesus
movement today is its growth. Soon after Seminar 70
moved on campus last year, attendance jumped from
under 175 to a figure approaching 300. Says one
intern, a former Stanford student: "Whatever we're
doing, it works."
A good part of what they're doing is
proselytizing—in the streets, in the dorms, on White
Plaza, and through meetings like Seminar 70 and
College Life. They are contacting every freshman on
campus to present their message. Members are urged
to apply for sponsor positions, particularly in
freshman dorms. Almost any sunny afternoon two or
three of them can be found sitting at the tables
outside Tresidder. "Christ said, 'Go into all the world
and rap with people," one told us.
David Roper feels that the Christian movement has
become popular on campus recently for several
reasons. According to Roper, the existentialism that
reigns on campus has caused despair, a "spiritual
hunger." There is a great desire for 'community,'
owing partly to the impersonality of student life here
and partly to the breakdown of the traditional family
structure. "People are looking for acceptance," says


THE IMAGE—The Jesus look has suffered through occasional and relative fads
over the millenia, but the message remains the same. Current patois has tabbed
loyalists as "Jesus Freaks." While the freaks may reflect the image, it seems to be
contagious these days.
Bill Tankersley, an intern with the campus ministry.
Many find in this 'Christian family' the warmth and
immediate acceptance they seek.
Roper explains the Jesus movement also as a
reaction to the lifeless institutionalized religion of the
1950'5. "There were a lot of nominal Christians in the
50's; they weren't vocal. Most people were still
enamored with science and technology. But now
we're seeing a return to humanism."
Many drug addicts have found the Jesus people's
appeal irresistible. The movement's literature is
replete with accounts of hopeless addicts finding
salvation in Jesus.
Jesus people tend to be defensive about the
prohibitions of the conventional morality that is an
integral part of their religion. They declare that their
"love for Jesus" negates any desire to sin; they
condemn the relativity of moral codes that shift with
the times, and advocate a return to the, absolute
mores that they find in Christ's teachings.
Explicitly political statements rarely issue from
their mouths. Their desire to avoid the power
relationships of politics is well expressed in their
position on the Indochina war: that harmony is to be
achieved on earth when enough of the world's people
accept Christ into their lives.
"The heart of man is the cause of war," says Jerry
Wyatt, a Campus Crusade intern. "You change
enough people, you change society."
Religious-political activism, such as that seen in the
case of the Berrigan brothers, is frowned upon.
"They're using religion as a cop-out, as an excuse,"
Wyatt adds.
Considerable tension has developed between the
Jesus Movement and some of the more liberal
elements of the Stanford religious community,
notably Dean B. David Napier. The disagreement
concerns several fundamental issues.

In a sermon last year, Napier charged that groups
such as Seminar 70 display a "mania for simplicity"
that induces them "to ignore the complexities and
some of the contradictions of the Gospel."
Dave Roper provides probably the most eloquent
statement of the "back to Christ" position. "The
basic facts of the Gospel are simple," says Roper.
"The refusal of people to bend their wills hangs them
up. What seems too simple is the authority out there.
There is a reluctance to accept this authority."
Criticism
Probably the most significant criticism of the Jesus
people is that they often seek a personal relationship
with Christ to the detriment of their brothers and
sisters on the earth. Says Napier, "Their varied
performances address, in effect, the same subject—the
salvation of the individual. Heal me. Accept me just
as I am. Help me be successful, integrated,
victorious. . . not my brother, not my sister; not my
neighbor. . . not justice and love, not black and
white, oppressed and oppressor, slave and free,
starving and stuffed—nothing but me, Lord, and
thee . . . just me and thee!"
Roper dismisses political or social action programs
as "robbed of spontaneity. The commitment must be
personal," he states. Roper maintains that a change in
orientation from the self outward (through Christ)
must precede any personal commitment.
"The last 50 years have seen a radical division
between the liberals and conservatives in the Christian
Church," he continues. "The liberals have
de-emphasized regeneration, redemption, and the
relationship with Christ" in favor of social action. "It
has to be both—and," he concluded. "It's not good
works, but the commitment to Christ that is essential.
One lives the rest of his life in the light of that
decision as Christ works out his lordship in a bigger
and bigger area of your life."

Some people are put off by the apparent
exclusiveness of membership in the "Christian"
family. There are several known cases of genuine love
relationships that have been broken up by the
"Christian" involved because the other would not
accept Christ in the same terms.
States one freshman who says he has asked Christ
into his life, "I sometimes get the impression that
they're doing the opposite of what they preach. They
seem to have an attitude of 'I'm better than you are
because I've received God."
Napier shares this criticism and stresses the
universality of the Christ event. "No man passes the
judgment of damnation on any of his brothers and
sisters anywhere, nor does he withhold himself from
companionship within the great human family,"
states Napier.
Despite the apparent radical and favorable
transformation of many Jesus people through their
relationships with Christ, Napier contends that they
are ignoring many of the realities of our present
human condition. He concludes, "I wonder just how
long the delusion can last."
Whether a delusion or not, the Jesus Movement
appears to be a product of relativism, of uncertainty,
of troubled times. It provides for many a viable
answer to the problem of living in a chaotic
world—regeneration through the person of Jesus
Christ.
Praise the Lord.
"... I figured there must be more to life than this.
And then I noticed many people around me who
seemed to be peaceful, loving, and sensitive. And 1
found that these people called themselves Christians."
They call themselves Christians. Some call
themselves 'Street Christians'; some, 'Jesus People,'
the 'Jesus Movement.' They have been widely labeled
'Jesus Freaks.' "Christ is alive," they affirm, and they
have sought—and found—a personal relationship with
Him.
Their presence here is manifest in various ways,
but it is unquestionably growing. They work through
no less than five organizations—Campus Crusade for
Christ, Christian World Liberation Front, Young Life
Campaign, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Fellowship of Christian Athletes-each with a
somewhat different approach, but all with great
common ground.
Almost 300 of them gather every Sunday morning
at Geology corner for "Seminar 70," a
service-cum-study meeting. Nearly one-third are
non-students. The noisy throng encompasses a wide
range of people: athletes, ex-drugheads, freshmen,
radicals, street people, long-time 'Christians,' and,
according to minister David Roper, "even some
Catholics." It appears to be as much a social event
among friends as a religious service. There are several
Orientals, a few Chicanos, no blacks.
The 'Family'
The 'family' is welcomed by a young campus
ministry intern; a few prayers are said, a guitarist

leads a religious folk-song or two, and then the floor
is turned over to anyone in the audience who has a
'Christian' experience to share.
A student stands up almost immediately. He is a
freshman, a 'new Christian'; lank blond hair falls to
his shoulders. He begins to speak gravely but
animatedly of his experience: while walking through
the Economics department, he dropped his new
glasses. Upon retrieving them, he discovered that an
infintesimal screw had fallen out onto the floor.
Despite the aid of two passing students and a
professor, who crawled about for some time seeking
the elusive screw, it remained lost.
The audience listens more attentively now as the
story approaches its climax. Frustrated, despairing, he
called on God for help; a bit of light on the floor
caught his eye; his screw was found.
Experience
Some in the audience nod; many smile knowingly.
A Christian experience. A visiting minister calls it
"heartening" to find such faith in a new Christian.
The young intern rejoins with an account of how God
helped him find his contact lens when he thought he
had dropped it down the drain. Praise the Lord.
Seminars fill the remainder of the hour, and the
'family' parts with a short prayer. Many go on to
attend another hour-long service at the Peninsula
Bible Church in Menlo Park.
They gather, too, at Tresidder on certain
weeknights under the auspices of Campus Crusade for
Christ. Here at "College Life" the format is much the
same, but there are only thirty people attending—but
"Usually we have about a hundred," one girl assures
me.
A speaker attempts to prove the divinity of Christ.

"Jesus will tell you now .. . You can know for
sure—after praying to Jesus."
And again come the testimonies. "I was lost . . . 1
was confused . . . then 1 accepted Christ into my
life." One girl chooses to sing:
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.

up. What seems too simple is the authority out there.
There is a reluctance to accept this authority."
Criticism
Probably the most significant criticism of the Jesus
people is that they often seek a personal relationship
with Christ to the detriment of their brothers and
sisters on the earth. Says Napier, "Their varied
performances address, in effect, the same subject—the
salvation of the individual. Heal me. Accept me just
as I am. Help me be successful, integrated,
victorious. . . not my brother, not my sister; not my
neighbor. . . not justice and love, not black and
white, oppressed and oppressor, slave and free,
starving and stuffed—nothing but me, Lord, and
thee . . . just me and thee!"
Roper dismisses political or social action programs
as "robbed of spontaneity. The commitment must be
personal," he states. Roper maintains that a change in
orientation from the self outward (through Christ)
must precede any personal commitment.
"The last 50 years have seen a radical division
between the liberals and conservatives in the Christian
Church," he continues. "The liberals have
de-emphasized regeneration, redemption, and the
relationship with Christ" in favor of social action. "It
has to be both—and," he concluded. "It's not good
works, but the commitment to Christ that is essential.
One lives the rest of his life in the light of that
decision as Christ works out his lordship in a bigger
and bigger area of your life."

Some people are put off by the apparent
exclusiveness of membership in the "Christian"
family. There are several known cases of genuine love
relationships that have been broken up by the
"Christian" involved because the other would not
accept Christ in the same terms.
States one freshman who says he has asked Christ
into his life, "I sometimes get the impression that
they're doing the opposite of what they preach. They
seem to have an attitude of 'I'm better than you are
because I've received God."
Napier shares this criticism and stresses the
universality of the Christ event. "No man passes the
judgment of damnation on any of his brothers and
sisters anywhere, nor does he withhold himself from
companionship within the great human family,"
states Napier.
Despite the apparent radical and favorable
transformation of many Jesus people through their
relationships with Christ, Napier contends that they
are ignoring many of the realities of our present
human condition. He concludes, "I wonder just how
long the delusion can last."
Whether a delusion or not, the Jesus Movement
appears to be a product of relativism, of uncertainty,
of troubled times. It provides for many a viable
answer to the problem of living in a chaotic
world—regeneration through the person of Jesus
Christ.
Praise the Lord.
"... I figured there must be more to life than this.
And then I noticed many people around me who
seemed to be peaceful, loving, and sensitive. And 1
found that these people called themselves Christians."
They call themselves Christians. Some call
themselves 'Street Christians'; some, 'Jesus People,'
the 'Jesus Movement.' They have been widely labeled
'Jesus Freaks.' "Christ is alive," they affirm, and they
have sought—and found—a personal relationship with
Him.
Their presence here is manifest in various ways,
but it is unquestionably growing. They work through
no less than five organizations—Campus Crusade for
Christ, Christian World Liberation Front, Young Life
Campaign, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Fellowship of Christian Athletes-each with a
somewhat different approach, but all with great
common ground.
Almost 300 of them gather every Sunday morning
at Geology corner for "Seminar 70," a
service-cum-study meeting. Nearly one-third are
non-students. The noisy throng encompasses a wide
range of people: athletes, ex-drugheads, freshmen,
radicals, street people, long-time 'Christians,' and,
according to minister David Roper, "even some
Catholics." It appears to be as much a social event
among friends as a religious service. There are several
Orientals, a few Chicanos, no blacks.
The 'Family'
The 'family' is welcomed by a young campus
ministry intern; a few prayers are said, a guitarist

leads a religious folk-song or two, and then the floor
is turned over to anyone in the audience who has a
'Christian' experience to share.
A student stands up almost immediately. He is a
freshman, a 'new Christian'; lank blond hair falls to
his shoulders. He begins to speak gravely but
animatedly of his experience: while walking through
the Economics department, he dropped his new
glasses. Upon retrieving them, he discovered that an
infintesimal screw had fallen out onto the floor.
Despite the aid of two passing students and a
professor, who crawled about for some time seeking
the elusive screw, it remained lost.
The audience listens more attentively now as the
story approaches its climax. Frustrated, despairing, he
called on God for help; a bit of light on the floor
caught his eye; his screw was found.
Experience
Some in the audience nod; many smile knowingly.
A Christian experience. A visiting minister calls it
"heartening" to find such faith in a new Christian.
The young intern rejoins with an account of how God
helped him find his contact lens when he thought he
had dropped it down the drain. Praise the Lord.
Seminars fill the remainder of the hour, and the
'family' parts with a short prayer. Many go on to
attend another hour-long service at the Peninsula
Bible Church in Menlo Park.
They gather, too, at Tresidder on certain
weeknights under the auspices of Campus Crusade for
Christ. Here at "College Life" the format is much the
same, but there are only thirty people attending—but
"Usually we have about a hundred," one girl assures
me.
A speaker attempts to prove the divinity of Christ.

"Jesus will tell you now .. . You can know for
sure—after praying to Jesus."
And again come the testimonies. "I was lost . . . 1
was confused . . . then 1 accepted Christ into my
life." One girl chooses to sing:
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
Growth
Perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the Jesus
movement today is its growth. Soon after Seminar 70
moved on campus last year, attendance jumped from
under 175 to a figure approaching 300. Says one
intern, a former Stanford student: "Whatever we're
doing, it works."
A good part of what they're doing is
proselytizing—in the streets, in the dorms, on White
Plaza, and through meetings like Seminar 70 and
College Life. They are contacting every freshman on
campus to present their message. Members are urged
to apply for sponsor positions, particularly in
freshman dorms. Almost any sunny afternoon two or
three of them can be found sitting at the tables
outside Tresidder. "Christ said, 'Go into all the world
and rap with people," one told us.
David Roper feels that the Christian movement has
become popular on campus recently for several
reasons. According to Roper, the existentialism that
reigns on campus has caused despair, a "spiritual
hunger." There is a great desire for 'community,'
owing partly to the impersonality of student life here
and partly to the breakdown of the traditional family
structure. "People are looking for acceptance," says


THE IMAGE—The Jesus look has suffered through occasional and relative fads
over the millenia, but the message remains the same. Current patois has tabbed
loyalists as "Jesus Freaks." While the freaks may reflect the image, it seems to be
contagious these days.
Bill Tankersley, an intern with the campus ministry.
Many find in this 'Christian family' the warmth and
immediate acceptance they seek.
Roper explains the Jesus movement also as a
reaction to the lifeless institutionalized religion of the
1950'5. "There were a lot of nominal Christians in the
50's; they weren't vocal. Most people were still
enamored with science and technology. But now
we're seeing a return to humanism."
Many drug addicts have found the Jesus people's
appeal irresistible. The movement's literature is
replete with accounts of hopeless addicts finding
salvation in Jesus.
Jesus people tend to be defensive about the
prohibitions of the conventional morality that is an
integral part of their religion. They declare that their
"love for Jesus" negates any desire to sin; they
condemn the relativity of moral codes that shift with
the times, and advocate a return to the, absolute
mores that they find in Christ's teachings.
Explicitly political statements rarely issue from
their mouths. Their desire to avoid the power
relationships of politics is well expressed in their
position on the Indochina war: that harmony is to be
achieved on earth when enough of the world's people
accept Christ into their lives.
"The heart of man is the cause of war," says Jerry
Wyatt, a Campus Crusade intern. "You change
enough people, you change society."
Religious-political activism, such as that seen in the
case of the Berrigan brothers, is frowned upon.
"They're using religion as a cop-out, as an excuse,"
Wyatt adds.
Considerable tension has developed between the
Jesus Movement and some of the more liberal
elements of the Stanford religious community,
notably Dean B. David Napier. The disagreement
concerns several fundamental issues.

In a sermon last year, Napier charged that groups
such as Seminar 70 display a "mania for simplicity"
that induces them "to ignore the complexities and
some of the contradictions of the Gospel."
Dave Roper provides probably the most eloquent
statement of the "back to Christ" position. "The
basic facts of the Gospel are simple," says Roper.
"The refusal of people to bend their wills hangs them
up. What seems too simple is the authority out there.
There is a reluctance to accept this authority."

Almost 300 of them gather every Sunday morning
at Geology corner for "Seminar 70," a
service-cum-study meeting. Nearly one-third are
non-students. The noisy throng encompasses a wide
range of people: athletes, ex-drugheads, freshmen,
radicals, street people, long-time 'Christians,' and,
according to minister David Roper, "even some
Catholics." It appears to be as much a social event
among friends as a religious service. There are several
Orientals, a few Chicanos, no blacks.
The 'Family'
The 'family' is welcomed by a young campus
ministry intern; a few prayers are said, a guitarist

leads a religious folk-song or two, and then the floor
is turned over to anyone in the audience who has a
'Christian' experience to share.
A student stands up almost immediately. He is a
freshman, a 'new Christian'; lank blond hair falls to
his shoulders. He begins to speak gravely but
animatedly of his experience: while walking through
the Economics department, he dropped his new
glasses. Upon retrieving them, he discovered that an
infintesimal screw had fallen out onto the floor.
Despite the aid of two passing students and a
professor, who crawled about for some time seeking
the elusive screw, it remained lost.
The audience listens more attentively now as the
story approaches its climax. Frustrated, despairing, he
called on God for help; a bit of light on the floor
caught his eye; his screw was found.
Experience
Some in the audience nod; many smile knowingly.
A Christian experience. A visiting minister calls it
"heartening" to find such faith in a new Christian.
The young intern rejoins with an account of how God
helped him find his contact lens when he thought he
had dropped it down the drain. Praise the Lord.
Seminars fill the remainder of the hour, and the
'family' parts with a short prayer. Many go on to
attend another hour-long service at the Peninsula
Bible Church in Menlo Park.
They gather, too, at Tresidder on certain
weeknights under the auspices of Campus Crusade for
Christ. Here at "College Life" the format is much the
same, but there are only thirty people attending—but
"Usually we have about a hundred," one girl assures
me.
A speaker attempts to prove the divinity of Christ.

"Jesus will tell you now .. . You can know for
sure—after praying to Jesus."
And again come the testimonies. "I was lost . . . 1
was confused . . . then 1 accepted Christ into my
life." One girl chooses to sing:
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
Growth
Perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the Jesus
movement today is its growth. Soon after Seminar 70
moved on campus last year, attendance jumped from
under 175 to a figure approaching 300. Says one
intern, a former Stanford student: "Whatever we're
doing, it works."
A good part of what they're doing is
proselytizing—in the streets, in the dorms, on White
Plaza, and through meetings like Seminar 70 and
College Life. They are contacting every freshman on
campus to present their message. Members are urged
to apply for sponsor positions, particularly in
freshman dorms. Almost any sunny afternoon two or
three of them can be found sitting at the tables
outside Tresidder. "Christ said, 'Go into all the world
and rap with people," one told us.
David Roper feels that the Christian movement has
become popular on campus recently for several
reasons. According to Roper, the existentialism that
reigns on campus has caused despair, a "spiritual
hunger." There is a great desire for 'community,'
owing partly to the impersonality of student life here
and partly to the breakdown of the traditional family
structure. "People are looking for acceptance," says


THE IMAGE—The Jesus look has suffered through occasional and relative fads
over the millenia, but the message remains the same. Current patois has tabbed
loyalists as "Jesus Freaks." While the freaks may reflect the image, it seems to be
contagious these days.
Bill Tankersley, an intern with the campus ministry.
Many find in this 'Christian family' the warmth and
immediate acceptance they seek.
Roper explains the Jesus movement also as a
reaction to the lifeless institutionalized religion of the
1950'5. "There were a lot of nominal Christians in the
50's; they weren't vocal. Most people were still
enamored with science and technology. But now
we're seeing a return to humanism."
Many drug addicts have found the Jesus people's
appeal irresistible. The movement's literature is
replete with accounts of hopeless addicts finding
salvation in Jesus.
Jesus people tend to be defensive about the
prohibitions of the conventional morality that is an
integral part of their religion. They declare that their
"love for Jesus" negates any desire to sin; they
condemn the relativity of moral codes that shift with
the times, and advocate a return to the, absolute
mores that they find in Christ's teachings.
Explicitly political statements rarely issue from
their mouths. Their desire to avoid the power
relationships of politics is well expressed in their
position on the Indochina war: that harmony is to be
achieved on earth when enough of the world's people
accept Christ into their lives.
"The heart of man is the cause of war," says Jerry
Wyatt, a Campus Crusade intern. "You change
enough people, you change society."
Religious-political activism, such as that seen in the
case of the Berrigan brothers, is frowned upon.
"They're using religion as a cop-out, as an excuse,"
Wyatt adds.
Considerable tension has developed between the
Jesus Movement and some of the more liberal
elements of the Stanford religious community,
notably Dean B. David Napier. The disagreement
concerns several fundamental issues.

In a sermon last year, Napier charged that groups
such as Seminar 70 display a "mania for simplicity"
that induces them "to ignore the complexities and
some of the contradictions of the Gospel."
Dave Roper provides probably the most eloquent
statement of the "back to Christ" position. "The
basic facts of the Gospel are simple," says Roper.
"The refusal of people to bend their wills hangs them
up. What seems too simple is the authority out there.
There is a reluctance to accept this authority."
Criticism
Probably the most significant criticism of the Jesus
people is that they often seek a personal relationship
with Christ to the detriment of their brothers and
sisters on the earth. Says Napier, "Their varied
performances address, in effect, the same subject—the
salvation of the individual. Heal me. Accept me just
as I am. Help me be successful, integrated,
victorious. . . not my brother, not my sister; not my
neighbor. . . not justice and love, not black and
white, oppressed and oppressor, slave and free,
starving and stuffed—nothing but me, Lord, and
thee . . . just me and thee!"
Roper dismisses political or social action programs
as "robbed of spontaneity. The commitment must be
personal," he states. Roper maintains that a change in
orientation from the self outward (through Christ)
must precede any personal commitment.
"The last 50 years have seen a radical division
between the liberals and conservatives in the Christian
Church," he continues. "The liberals have
de-emphasized regeneration, redemption, and the
relationship with Christ" in favor of social action. "It
has to be both—and," he concluded. "It's not good
works, but the commitment to Christ that is essential.
One lives the rest of his life in the light of that
decision as Christ works out his lordship in a bigger
and bigger area of your life."

Some people are put off by the apparent
exclusiveness of membership in the "Christian"
family. There are several known cases of genuine love
relationships that have been broken up by the
"Christian" involved because the other would not
accept Christ in the same terms.
States one freshman who says he has asked Christ
into his life, "I sometimes get the impression that
they're doing the opposite of what they preach. They
seem to have an attitude of 'I'm better than you are
because I've received God."
Napier shares this criticism and stresses the
universality of the Christ event. "No man passes the
judgment of damnation on any of his brothers and
sisters anywhere, nor does he withhold himself from
companionship within the great human family,"
states Napier.
Despite the apparent radical and favorable
transformation of many Jesus people through their
relationships with Christ, Napier contends that they
are ignoring many of the realities of our present
human condition. He concludes, "I wonder just how
long the delusion can last."
Whether a delusion or not, the Jesus Movement
appears to be a product of relativism, of uncertainty,
of troubled times. It provides for many a viable
answer to the problem of living in a chaotic
world—regeneration through the person of Jesus
Christ.
Praise the Lord.
"... I figured there must be more to life than this.
And then I noticed many people around me who
seemed to be peaceful, loving, and sensitive. And 1
found that these people called themselves Christians."
They call themselves Christians. Some call
themselves 'Street Christians'; some, 'Jesus People,'
the 'Jesus Movement.' They have been widely labeled
'Jesus Freaks.' "Christ is alive," they affirm, and they
have sought—and found—a personal relationship with
Him.
Their presence here is manifest in various ways,
but it is unquestionably growing. They work through
no less than five organizations—Campus Crusade for
Christ, Christian World Liberation Front, Young Life
Campaign, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Fellowship of Christian Athletes-each with a
somewhat different approach, but all with great
common ground.
