# Old Time Religion Comes Back

### JIM DEERINGER DOYLE McMANUS News Feature 
"... I figured there must be more to life than this.
And then I noticed many people around me who
seemed to be peaceful, loving, and sensitive. And 1
found that these people called themselves Christians."
They call themselves Christians. Some call
themselves 'Street Christians'; some, 'Jesus People,'
the 'Jesus Movement.' They have been widely labeled
'Jesus Freaks.' "Christ is alive," they affirm, and they
have sought—and found—a personal relationship with
Him.
Their presence here is manifest in various ways,
but it is unquestionably growing. They work through
no less than five organizations—Campus Crusade for
Christ, Christian World Liberation Front, Young Life
Campaign, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship,
Fellowship of Christian Athletes-each with a
somewhat different approach, but all with great
common ground.
Almost 300 of them gather every Sunday morning
at Geology corner for "Seminar 70," a
service-cum-study meeting. Nearly one-third are
non-students. The noisy throng encompasses a wide
range of people: athletes, ex-drugheads, freshmen,
radicals, street people, long-time 'Christians,' and,
according to minister David Roper, "even some
Catholics." It appears to be as much a social event
among friends as a religious service. There are several
Orientals, a few Chicanos, no blacks.
The 'Family'
The 'family' is welcomed by a young campus
ministry intern; a few prayers are said, a guitarist

leads a religious folk-song or two, and then the floor
is turned over to anyone in the audience who has a
'Christian' experience to share.
A student stands up almost immediately. He is a
freshman, a 'new Christian'; lank blond hair falls to
his shoulders. He begins to speak gravely but
animatedly of his experience: while walking through
the Economics department, he dropped his new
glasses. Upon retrieving them, he discovered that an
infintesimal screw had fallen out onto the floor.
Despite the aid of two passing students and a
professor, who crawled about for some time seeking
the elusive screw, it remained lost.
The audience listens more attentively now as the
story approaches its climax. Frustrated, despairing, he
called on God for help; a bit of light on the floor
caught his eye; his screw was found.
Experience
Some in the audience nod; many smile knowingly.
A Christian experience. A visiting minister calls it
"heartening" to find such faith in a new Christian.
The young intern rejoins with an account of how God
helped him find his contact lens when he thought he
had dropped it down the drain. Praise the Lord.
Seminars fill the remainder of the hour, and the
'family' parts with a short prayer. Many go on to
attend another hour-long service at the Peninsula
Bible Church in Menlo Park.
They gather, too, at Tresidder on certain
weeknights under the auspices of Campus Crusade for
Christ. Here at "College Life" the format is much the
same, but there are only thirty people attending—but
"Usually we have about a hundred," one girl assures
me.
A speaker attempts to prove the divinity of Christ.

"Jesus will tell you now .. . You can know for
sure—after praying to Jesus."
And again come the testimonies. "I was lost . . . 1
was confused . . . then 1 accepted Christ into my
life." One girl chooses to sing:
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see.
Growth
Perhaps the most dynamic aspect of the Jesus
movement today is its growth. Soon after Seminar 70
moved on campus last year, attendance jumped from
under 175 to a figure approaching 300. Says one
intern, a former Stanford student: "Whatever we're
doing, it works."
A good part of what they're doing is
proselytizing—in the streets, in the dorms, on White
Plaza, and through meetings like Seminar 70 and
College Life. They are contacting every freshman on
campus to present their message. Members are urged
to apply for sponsor positions, particularly in
freshman dorms. Almost any sunny afternoon two or
three of them can be found sitting at the tables
outside Tresidder. "Christ said, 'Go into all the world
and rap with people," one told us.
David Roper feels that the Christian movement has
become popular on campus recently for several
reasons. According to Roper, the existentialism that
reigns on campus has caused despair, a "spiritual
hunger." There is a great desire for 'community,'
owing partly to the impersonality of student life here
and partly to the breakdown of the traditional family
structure. "People are looking for acceptance," says


THE IMAGE—The Jesus look has suffered through occasional and relative fads
over the millenia, but the message remains the same. Current patois has tabbed
loyalists as "Jesus Freaks." While the freaks may reflect the image, it seems to be
contagious these days.
