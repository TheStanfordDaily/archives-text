## What's IT All About? 
### 
barry wood

With the coming of spring I look around and
note that it is not so rainy or dull. More often it is
sunny and bright. The question is: What is IT?
There always has to be an "it" for it to be sunny,
and IT seems there must be an IT implied in
everything we say. I conclude that since everything
implies IT, IT is absolutely central.
Christians call IT God; Moslems call IT Allah;
the ancient Chinese called IT Tao; I cal IT IT.
What of it? Everything is OF IT, for every-thing is
IT thing-ing. Thus, to "do your thing" is to do IT,
but you can never understand IT because IT is
standing-under you. That is, you don't really do
IT—IT does you. The only mistake, then, is to try
to over-do IT.
Once upon a time, way back at the beginning
before there was even time, there was only IT. Of
course, IT was very lonely and very helpless,
because IT was both everything and nothing.
There was really no way to tell IT from pure
emptiness. IT was a very frustrating business.
So IT decided IT had to liven things up with a
game. Of course, the game meant that someone
had to be IT. And it turned out that IT had to be
IT, since there was no one else to be IT. So IT was
IT—but IT had also to hide IT-Self, since there was
no one else to hide. So IT went and hid, and IT
went out to seek IT-Self hiding from IT-Self. The
end result of this very far-out game was that IT
ceased to be IT, and went into hiding as everything
else.
Innermost Truth
The innermost truth according to the Hindus is
that Brahman (God) hides himself as Atman (the
Self) of every man. This means that the innermost
Self is God, or YOU are IT. Since IT is hiding from
IT-self, IT turns out to be YOU, only you
probably don't know IT. Indeed, you probably go
about looking for IT, not knowing that IT is doing
the looking. Weird.
Does itmatter? Of course—lT "matters" all over
the place, which is to say IT "trees" and "birds"
and "peoples." Every mountain and ocean is IT
"rocking" and "rolling." IT is all a big dance, a
cosmic frug—which is what any good game of
hide-and-seek really is. A continual rhythm of
hide/seek, lost/found, now-you-see-IT-now you
don't. Here IT is, "itting" IT all over the place.
And if you don't believe IT, you don't believe
anything, for everything is IT.
What's IT all about. IT is all about, which is to
say IT is up to anything and everything. This is
where IT'S at—live IT up, get with IT. You are
where IT'S at, and that doesn't have to be

anyplace special, since where you're at is where
IT'S at.
Does IT make a difference? Df course. IT makes
all the differences. That's IT'S game—always being
different from the last time. So, IT does the
people-game differently every time, since
(remember!) IT is trying to hide from IT-self.
Hiding from IT is largely a matter of finding a new
hiding place. Thus every time IT "peoples" a
brand new hiding-place-baby is born. (IT is very
clever at hiding.)
Can you avoid IT? Hardly, for YOU are IT-can
you avoid the Avoider? In the same way, you can
never fully know IT, because IT always does the
knowing. Like a mirror trying to reflect IT-self,
you ge\ in a knot if you try.
But what is the point of 117 Precisely. IT has no
point or, rather, IT is all points. There is no point
and no place where IT isn't. You can never out-do
IT because IT does everything. You can never do
IT over, for IT will do you over. That is to say,
after you die, and after "I" die, IT will do what IT
has always done. IT will hide IT-self and"I" It-self
again. And thus "I" will be undone and done
again—by IT.
Christian Boob
Now I predict that there will be some boob out
there who will not get IT. Predictably, he will be a
tough-minded Christian type who doesn't know
that he is IT and thinks instead that he is a
"sinner." The sinner, of course, is one of the best
hiding places IT ever devised. He keeps on looking
for IT and talking about IT, and fails to see that he
is IT looking and talking.
Everyone is of course free to do IT his own
way, even if that means being completely
irrelevant. Some will go searching for IT, and
that's what gurus are for. But too much searching
is calculated to miss IT, and every good guru
knows this. Every time a new student appears the
good guru laughs to himself and thinks, "Here IT
comes again." That's why he has that funny look
in his eye. But then if you go looking for IT, not
knowing that you are IT doing the looking, you
deserved to be laughed at. That's why laughter is
always where IT'S at.
When IT comes right down to IT, IT is the
Joker in the deck. But since everything is IT, the
whole deck is a joke. So now you know why all
the angels in Dante's heaven are laughing fit to kill.
They're laughing at you because you don't know
IT. *

you avoid the Avoider? In the same way, you can
never fully know IT, because IT always does the
knowing. Like a mirror trying to reflect IT-self,
you ge\ in a knot if you try.
But what is the point of 117 Precisely. IT has no
point or, rather, IT is all points. There is no point
and no place where IT isn't. You can never out-do
IT because IT does everything. You can never do
IT over, for IT will do you over. That is to say,
after you die, and after "I" die, IT will do what IT
has always done. IT will hide IT-self and"I" It-self
again. And thus "I" will be undone and done
again—by IT.
Christian Boob
Now I predict that there will be some boob out
there who will not get IT. Predictably, he will be a
tough-minded Christian type who doesn't know
that he is IT and thinks instead that he is a
"sinner." The sinner, of course, is one of the best
hiding places IT ever devised. He keeps on looking
for IT and talking about IT, and fails to see that he
is IT looking and talking.
Everyone is of course free to do IT his own
way, even if that means being completely
irrelevant. Some will go searching for IT, and
that's what gurus are for. But too much searching
is calculated to miss IT, and every good guru
knows this. Every time a new student appears the
good guru laughs to himself and thinks, "Here IT
comes again." That's why he has that funny look
in his eye. But then if you go looking for IT, not
knowing that you are IT doing the looking, you
deserved to be laughed at. That's why laughter is
always where IT'S at.
When IT comes right down to IT, IT is the
Joker in the deck. But since everything is IT, the
whole deck is a joke. So now you know why all
the angels in Dante's heaven are laughing fit to kill.
They're laughing at you because you don't know
IT. *

With the coming of spring I look around and
note that it is not so rainy or dull. More often it is
sunny and bright. The question is: What is IT?
There always has to be an "it" for it to be sunny,
and IT seems there must be an IT implied in
everything we say. I conclude that since everything
implies IT, IT is absolutely central.
Christians call IT God; Moslems call IT Allah;
the ancient Chinese called IT Tao; I cal IT IT.
What of it? Everything is OF IT, for every-thing is
IT thing-ing. Thus, to "do your thing" is to do IT,
but you can never understand IT because IT is
standing-under you. That is, you don't really do
IT—IT does you. The only mistake, then, is to try
to over-do IT.
Once upon a time, way back at the beginning
before there was even time, there was only IT. Of
course, IT was very lonely and very helpless,
because IT was both everything and nothing.
There was really no way to tell IT from pure
emptiness. IT was a very frustrating business.
So IT decided IT had to liven things up with a
game. Of course, the game meant that someone
had to be IT. And it turned out that IT had to be
IT, since there was no one else to be IT. So IT was
IT—but IT had also to hide IT-Self, since there was
no one else to hide. So IT went and hid, and IT
went out to seek IT-Self hiding from IT-Self. The
end result of this very far-out game was that IT
ceased to be IT, and went into hiding as everything
else.
Innermost Truth
The innermost truth according to the Hindus is
that Brahman (God) hides himself as Atman (the
Self) of every man. This means that the innermost
Self is God, or YOU are IT. Since IT is hiding from
IT-self, IT turns out to be YOU, only you
probably don't know IT. Indeed, you probably go
about looking for IT, not knowing that IT is doing
the looking. Weird.
Does itmatter? Of course—lT "matters" all over
the place, which is to say IT "trees" and "birds"
and "peoples." Every mountain and ocean is IT
"rocking" and "rolling." IT is all a big dance, a
cosmic frug—which is what any good game of
hide-and-seek really is. A continual rhythm of
hide/seek, lost/found, now-you-see-IT-now you
don't. Here IT is, "itting" IT all over the place.
And if you don't believe IT, you don't believe
anything, for everything is IT.
What's IT all about. IT is all about, which is to
say IT is up to anything and everything. This is
where IT'S at—live IT up, get with IT. You are
where IT'S at, and that doesn't have to be

anyplace special, since where you're at is where
IT'S at.
Does IT make a difference? Df course. IT makes
all the differences. That's IT'S game—always being
different from the last time. So, IT does the
people-game differently every time, since
(remember!) IT is trying to hide from IT-self.
Hiding from IT is largely a matter of finding a new
hiding place. Thus every time IT "peoples" a
brand new hiding-place-baby is born. (IT is very
clever at hiding.)
Can you avoid IT? Hardly, for YOU are IT-can
you avoid the Avoider? In the same way, you can
never fully know IT, because IT always does the

IT—but IT had also to hide IT-Self, since there was
no one else to hide. So IT went and hid, and IT
went out to seek IT-Self hiding from IT-Self. The
end result of this very far-out game was that IT
ceased to be IT, and went into hiding as everything
else.
Innermost Truth
The innermost truth according to the Hindus is
that Brahman (God) hides himself as Atman (the
Self) of every man. This means that the innermost
Self is God, or YOU are IT. Since IT is hiding from
IT-self, IT turns out to be YOU, only you
probably don't know IT. Indeed, you probably go
about looking for IT, not knowing that IT is doing
the looking. Weird.
Does itmatter? Of course—lT "matters" all over
the place, which is to say IT "trees" and "birds"
and "peoples." Every mountain and ocean is IT
"rocking" and "rolling." IT is all a big dance, a
cosmic frug—which is what any good game of
hide-and-seek really is. A continual rhythm of
hide/seek, lost/found, now-you-see-IT-now you
don't. Here IT is, "itting" IT all over the place.
And if you don't believe IT, you don't believe
anything, for everything is IT.
What's IT all about. IT is all about, which is to
say IT is up to anything and everything. This is
where IT'S at—live IT up, get with IT. You are
where IT'S at, and that doesn't have to be

anyplace special, since where you're at is where
IT'S at.
Does IT make a difference? Df course. IT makes
all the differences. That's IT'S game—always being
different from the last time. So, IT does the
people-game differently every time, since
(remember!) IT is trying to hide from IT-self.
Hiding from IT is largely a matter of finding a new
hiding place. Thus every time IT "peoples" a
brand new hiding-place-baby is born. (IT is very
clever at hiding.)
Can you avoid IT? Hardly, for YOU are IT-can
you avoid the Avoider? In the same way, you can
never fully know IT, because IT always does the
knowing. Like a mirror trying to reflect IT-self,
you ge\ in a knot if you try.
But what is the point of 117 Precisely. IT has no
point or, rather, IT is all points. There is no point
and no place where IT isn't. You can never out-do
IT because IT does everything. You can never do
IT over, for IT will do you over. That is to say,
after you die, and after "I" die, IT will do what IT
has always done. IT will hide IT-self and"I" It-self
again. And thus "I" will be undone and done
again—by IT.
Christian Boob
Now I predict that there will be some boob out
there who will not get IT. Predictably, he will be a
tough-minded Christian type who doesn't know
that he is IT and thinks instead that he is a
"sinner." The sinner, of course, is one of the best
hiding places IT ever devised. He keeps on looking
for IT and talking about IT, and fails to see that he
is IT looking and talking.
Everyone is of course free to do IT his own
way, even if that means being completely
irrelevant. Some will go searching for IT, and
that's what gurus are for. But too much searching
is calculated to miss IT, and every good guru
knows this. Every time a new student appears the
good guru laughs to himself and thinks, "Here IT
comes again." That's why he has that funny look
in his eye. But then if you go looking for IT, not
knowing that you are IT doing the looking, you
deserved to be laughed at. That's why laughter is
always where IT'S at.
When IT comes right down to IT, IT is the
Joker in the deck. But since everything is IT, the
whole deck is a joke. So now you know why all
the angels in Dante's heaven are laughing fit to kill.
They're laughing at you because you don't know
IT. *

With the coming of spring I look around and
note that it is not so rainy or dull. More often it is
sunny and bright. The question is: What is IT?
There always has to be an "it" for it to be sunny,
and IT seems there must be an IT implied in
everything we say. I conclude that since everything
implies IT, IT is absolutely central.
Christians call IT God; Moslems call IT Allah;
the ancient Chinese called IT Tao; I cal IT IT.
What of it? Everything is OF IT, for every-thing is
IT thing-ing. Thus, to "do your thing" is to do IT,
but you can never understand IT because IT is
standing-under you. That is, you don't really do
IT—IT does you. The only mistake, then, is to try
to over-do IT.
Once upon a time, way back at the beginning
before there was even time, there was only IT. Of
course, IT was very lonely and very helpless,
because IT was both everything and nothing.
There was really no way to tell IT from pure
emptiness. IT was a very frustrating business.
So IT decided IT had to liven things up with a
game. Of course, the game meant that someone
had to be IT. And it turned out that IT had to be
IT, since there was no one else to be IT. So IT was
IT—but IT had also to hide IT-Self, since there was
no one else to hide. So IT went and hid, and IT
went out to seek IT-Self hiding from IT-Self. The
end result of this very far-out game was that IT
ceased to be IT, and went into hiding as everything
else.
