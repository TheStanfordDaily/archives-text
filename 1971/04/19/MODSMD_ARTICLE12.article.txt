# Films This Week
## Welle, Truffaut On Campus 
### TODD McCARTHY 
I've hesitated somewhat to resume my old
Films of the Week column since so many
improvised, Ad Hoc film societies have sprung up
recently that it's hard to tell in advance what's
playing. Expecting my list this week to be
incomplete, I'd like to proceed anyway and ask
anyone showing a film on campus to contact me at
the Daily about a week in advance for its inclusion
in my column.
Aside from Buster Keaton and the Marx
Brothers in their prime, "Bringing Up Baby" is
close to the funniest film I've ever seen. Cary
Grant and Katharine Hepburn are at their best and
this film begins to explain what the canonization
of Howard Hawks is all about. Also shewing in
Mem Clive beginning at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday is
one of William Wyler's best, "Jezebel," which
brought Bette Davis her second Oscar. A classic
double bill.
Being shown on Thursday in Cubberley by the
International Association is Pier Poalo Pasolini's
"The Hawks and the Sparrows." Pasolini, who
made this amusingly absurd fable in 1965, also
directed "The Gospel According to St. Matthew"
and "Teorema."
"Shadow of a Doubt" functions well enough on
the mystery level but is much more interesting for
Hitchcock's extraordinary view of Americana (it
was filmed in Santa Rosa in 1943) and how a small
disturbance can seriously disrupt its complacency.
I think it's one of Hitch's best, and it shows on
Thursday at 7:30 p.m. and 9:30 p.m. in Bishop.
Born Yesterday
Judy Holliday beat out formidable competition
in Bette Davis and Gloria Swanson to win the
1951 Best Actress Oscar. Today, "Born
Yesterday" is still delightful and Judy looks as
fresh (if anachronistic) as ever. At Tresidder on
Friday.

"The Bride Wore Black" is Francois Truffaut's
most extensive and explicit hommage to
Hitchcock and while it's not one of my favorite
Truffauts, it remains a solid film, beautifully
photographed and well acted, particularly by the
men. Jeanne Moreau stars and the music is by
Hitchcock's favorite composer, Bernard Herrmann.
In Cubberley on Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and 10:00
p.m.
I've seen "Citizen Kane" six times over the past
three years and each time, it seems more
extraordinary. The film has become progressively
more humorous, and the initial awe of Welles'
camera work has made way for a great respect for
the director's mastery of the principles of staging
and storytelling. I don't think the film could ever
be exhausted by too many viewings.
Raising Kane
Pauline Kael's two-part article in the New
Yorker, "Raising Kane," seems to have caused
quite a bit of talk, almost all of it ecstatic. While
the piece is obviously impeccable historically and
journalistically, I have some reservations. Actually,
it needs an introduction. What is not clear to the
average reader is that Pauline's work is a lengthy
introduction to the forthcoming published
screenplay of "Citizen Kane." As an introduction
to the screenplay, the piece is very fine. As an
analysis of Welles and an independent aesthetic
analysis of the film (as it appears in the context of
New Yorker, I find it deficient and deceptive.
However, I am especially grateful for the
information on Herman Mankietwicz and the
tentative attempt to differentiate between Hearst
and Hearst/Kane. The film is being shown on
Saturday at 7:30 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. in Bishop.
"The Ballad of Cable Hogue" was one of the
best films of last year, so it's no surprise that it
was neglected by both its distributor and the
critics. Sam Peckinpah's best film to date is this
Sunday's Flick.
