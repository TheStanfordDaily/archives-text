## 
### 
The directors of the American
Society of Newspaper Editors
meeting in Washington on Friday
denounced the police raid of the
Daily offices a week ago.
The Associated Press Managing
Editors Association also voiced
strong opposition to the search
warrant invasion, calling it "an
attack on the freedom of the
press."
The ASNE statement called the
6:00 p.m. search by four Palo
Alto policemen, accompanied by
two Stanford officers, an
"intolerable harassment." They
went on to term the raid "a threat
to the peoples' First Amendment
rights" of freedom of the press.
The police, acting on a warrant
issued by a municipal judge,
searched through desks, files, and
the Daily darkroom looking for
pictures and negatives of last
week's violent confrontation at
the Stanford Hospital.
"I am most grateful for the
support of the ASNE and
everyone else in our fight against
police harassment," said Daily
editor Felicity Barringer.
