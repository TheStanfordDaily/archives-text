# Trackmen Edged

### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Gusty Winds, small
disappointments in just enough
events, and an inopportune law
exam, told the story Saturday as
Stanford's track squad was edged
by Oregon State.
OSU, while not considered a
track power in the Pacific-8
Conference, mustered just enough
strength in their poorest events to
surprise the Indians in a meet
Stanford was fairly confident of
winning. The Beavers recorded an
85 1/3 to 68 2/3 triumph. The
Indians are now 3-3 for the
season.
Chuck Francis, the Indian's
leading sprinter, was unable to
postpone a law exam; teammates
Ken Curl (competing for the first
time this year), Rufus Shaw, and
Rick Tipton lost to a relative
unknown, OSU's Robert Medlock,
in both the 100 and 220.
Medlock, Shaw, and Curl were
all timed in 21.7 in the 220. Curl
lost a close decision at the tape in
the 100.
Tipton, who has a 13.8 hurdles
race to his credit already this year,
was hampered by a heavy wind
sweeping up the main
straightaway. Bumped in mid-race
and forced off stride, he finished
third in 15.3.
"Our 440-Relay team just
never figured to win," OSU coach
Eerny Wagner was quoted in the
Chronicle. "Medlock is the only
pure sprinter on the squad. From
the looks of them you wouldn't
expect to beat anybody, but they
already have knocked off San

Jose, Washington State, and now
Stanford."
The Beavers won in 41.9, the
Indians closing fast in 42.0.
The heavy and gusty winds
held down most times, although
Stanford's premier miler, Duncan
Mac Donald, won with a find
4:08.2. Mac Donald had been ill
with the flu and Saturday's race
was his first really competitive
effort in some weeks.
Don Kardong was upset in the
3-mile, losing to Keith Munson's
meet record of 13.43.0. Arvid
Kretz was second in that race.
National High School
Champion pole vaulter Casey
Carrigan easily won his speciality
in 16'-5 1/4. Not greatly affected
by the gusts, Carrigan moved the
bar up to 17' 1" and barely
missed on his third attempt.
Some encouragement was
provided by Randy White and
Tom Long, who finished 1,2 in
the 440-hurdles (White winning in
a meet record of 52.6); Tom
Anderson, who won the long
jump with a 24-5 1/4 effort; and
the mile-relay squad of Jim
Kauffman, Tom Long, Larry
Roberts, and Pete Fairchild.
Allen Meredith, the Stanford
co-captain, put together a fine
50'-0" triple jump, but was bested
by Robert Reader's fine meet
record of 51' 11 1/2". Meredith
has a lifetime best of 52'-3".
Stanford failed to score in the
steeplechase, shotput, and took
only a third in the javelin.
The Indians face USC next
week at Stanford stadium.
