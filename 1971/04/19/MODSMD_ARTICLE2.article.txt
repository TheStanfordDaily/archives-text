# Hospital Strike Possible
## 
### LOUISE LIBBY 
Stanford hospital workers are
planning a slowdown strike if their
demands are not met by hospital
officials by 9:00 a.m. today.
The planned strike and the events
leading up to it were covered in a
informal informational meeting, held
by the Black Liberation Front in the
Serra Lounge. The current demands,
eleven in all, stem from the firing of
Sam Bridges, a black custodian, and the
denial of tenure to Dr. Jose Aquilar,
Chicano neurosurgeon.
Two spokesmen of the BLF, a

revolutionary group based in Redwood
City and East Palo Alto, conducted the
meeting, which was attended by about
20 people.
The BLF members described the
proposed strike as affecting primarily
black and brown workers in
maintenance jobs, although efforts are
being made to include the white
workers in the protest. They considered
the hospital administration unlikely to
accept the eleven demands made on the
workers' behalf, and felt that in that
case, preparations for the strike would
be carried out.

A rally at 9:00 a.m. on the Med
Center lawn will reveal the hospital's
decision on the demands. This was the
deadline set by the Black United Front,
a coalition group consisting of the BLF,
the Black Workers Caucus, and the
BSU. The BUF presented the demands
in concert with the Chicano
organization, the Alianza Latina.
The two BLF members told the
meeting that a press release which
appeared in Saturday's Chronicle is
false. The report stated that Bridges
had agreed to submit his case to a
grievance procedure, but according to
the BLF, Bridges a member of the
BUF, wishes to settle the issue through
that organization. A leaflet distributed
at the meeting stressed the need to
fight racism at large, and individual
discrimination.
The spokesmen also remarked that
while efforts were presently
concentrated on the Med Center
struggle, the issues would eventually be
tied in with the Tresidder boycott and
other worker protests.


HOSPITAL PRINCIPALS—Fired janitor Sam Bridges (upper left) and neurosurgeon Jose Aguilar, refused reappointment
recently, are the two men in whose behalf protesters have made the Stanford Hospital the center of action this quarter.
