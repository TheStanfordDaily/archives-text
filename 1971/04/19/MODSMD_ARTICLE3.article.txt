# Health Center Offers Abortion Counselling
## 
### CARLA KALLAN 
From a surgical standpoint, abortions are relatively simple operations. The two
most widely used techniques, the dilation and curettage (D&C) and the vacuum
aspiration method, require a mere ten minutes to complete. Nonetheless, the cost
for each runs from $450 to $500, and the pregnant girl must go to considerable
trouble before the operation is finally approved.
Both Cowell Student Health Center and Planned Parenthood in Palo Alto
advise coeds seeking abortions. These organizations serve as information centers,
and have no connection with medical or psychiatric arrangements.
Most Stanford undergraduates go to Cowell, where they are assured several
counselling sessions, both alone and with the father. According to Mrs. Charlotte
Siegel, a social worker at the health center, a counsellor will "try to offer
knowledge and himself as a supportive figure during the abortion."
Planned Parenthood
At Planned Parenthood, a girl receives only one interview, where she is given
the names of obstetricians and psychiatrists to consult. Mrs. Virginia Ziegler,
volunteer coordinator of counselling services, encourages girls to make a
"reasonable" decision, rather than automatically "conforming to the social
pressure for abortion."
According to a recent interpretation of California State Law, however, girls
under 21 need parental permission for a therapeutic abortion, unless they are
"emancipated" minors.
The pregnant girl is responsible for arrangements with the hospital and
obstetrician. If she seeks abortion on the grounds that the continuance of
pregnancy would impair her mental health, she must also secure a psychiatrist's
release. At least 95 percent of the girls seeking abortions at Stanford Hospital use
this reason.

A psychiatrist's fee ranges from $35 to $50. There is wide diversity in the
criteria used to determine what is "detrimental" to mental health. Doctors who
feel unable to recommend a girl for abortion often refer her to another
psychiatrist.
Both the psychiatrist and the obstetrician send reports to the hospital's
Therapeutic Abortion Board, a commission composed of five members, including
at least two obstetric physicians. The great majority of abortions in the Bay Area
are approved. Out of 1,241 applications received last year by Stanford Hospital,
only three were denied.
Once the abortion is approved, the girl must arrange for payment. The doctor
charges about $200, the anesthesiologist $50, and the hospital $150. This does
not include the psychiatrist's fees. Stanford Hospital demands $100 in cash,
although the balance may be paid by check.
"Rip-Off"
Mrs. Ziegler termed this "ridiculously expensive, but it seems to be what traffic
will bear." Miss Campbell feels abortions are a "rip-off," in New York the whole
procedure costs $100," she said.
The Stanford Hospital performed over 1500 abortions last year. Over 95
percent of these were California residents, the majority from the immediate area.
Only 2% of Stanford's undergraduate population sought abortions.
Dr. Warren Miller, a researcher in abortion motivation and psychiatric
consultant at the hospital, labelled the whole arrangement at Stanford Hospital
"unfortunate." "The program is based on a demand for service," he explained.
"As is true of America in general, the physical consequences are emphasized over
the psychological. They are easier to measure."
Outpatient
The hospital does not offer consultation of any kind, and girls are treated on
an outpatient basis. They are run through the facilities of the emergency room
and the recovery room without really being admitted to the hospital. One staff
member remarked, "if they had 40 cases of any other kind, you know damn well
Stanford would have a separate ward."
Dr. Miller feels that abortion laws will be liberalized as sexual values change
and population problems continue. "Many people hold a psychological view that
pregnant women should 'pay the consequences,' " he said. "But that's a hell of a
way to make people pay. A third party, the child, suffers." "The complications of
not getting an abortion often seem to be greater than getting one," he said.
