# Health Center Offers Abortion Counselling

### CARLA KALLAN 
From a surgical standpoint, abortions are relatively simple operations. The two
most widely used techniques, the dilation and curettage (D&C) and the vacuum
aspiration method, require a mere ten minutes to complete. Nonetheless, the cost
for each runs from $450 to $500, and the pregnant girl must go to considerable
trouble before the operation is finally approved.
Both Cowell Student Health Center and Planned Parenthood in Palo Alto
advise coeds seeking abortions. These organizations serve as information centers,
and have no connection with medical or psychiatric arrangements.
Most Stanford undergraduates go to Cowell, where they are assured several
counselling sessions, both alone and with the father. According to Mrs. Charlotte
Siegel, a social worker at the health center, a counsellor will "try to offer
knowledge and himself as a supportive figure during the abortion."
Planned Parenthood
At Planned Parenthood, a girl receives only one interview, where she is given
the names of obstetricians and psychiatrists to consult. Mrs. Virginia Ziegler,
volunteer coordinator of counselling services, encourages girls to make a
"reasonable" decision, rather than automatically "conforming to the social
pressure for abortion."
According to a recent interpretation of California State Law, however, girls
under 21 need parental permission for a therapeutic abortion, unless they are
"emancipated" minors.
The pregnant girl is responsible for arrangements with the hospital and
obstetrician. If she seeks abortion on the grounds that the continuance of
pregnancy would impair her mental health, she must also secure a psychiatrist's
release. At least 95 percent of the girls seeking abortions at Stanford Hospital use
this reason.
