# Progress Gets Busy Signal
## Growth Hurts Telephone Service 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
Although the Budget Adjustment
Program is reducing unnecessary
expenditures and expansion, the
University continues to grow. And that
growth has impaired the efficiency of
the phone systems serving the Stanford
community.
A fast busy signal or no dial tone
occasionally frustrates users of the 491
exchange, while some callers off
Stanford extensions must wait for
service on a critically overloaded
system.
Most students fetl the 491 system
used in dormitory residences is a vast
improvement over the switchboard
network in use until last fall. Under
that system, all calls would be answered
at switchboards located in various parts
of the campus. The operators would
page the room of the recipient of the
call, who would scream
acknowledgement at the paging speaker
and charge down the hall to one of the
dorm phones. Students could have
private phones installed at their own
expense, but few did. Though the
system cost students nothing, it was
inconvenient—except for the operators
who could use the paging system to
listen in on the action in selected
rooms.
In January 1970, the University
decided to tear out the switchboards
and asked that the phone company
provide individual service to student
rooms on campus. The phone company
couldn't handle 2,000 more lines
through the Palo Alto office, so they
installed at Stanford some spare
equipment they had on hand.
"It was an expedient to meet
service," explained Joe Payne, Pacific
Telephone Accounts Manager for
Stanford. "The equipment was put in
on a temporary basis."
Centrix Installed
The service available to students in

university residences is called
Centrex—a system in which the last
four digits of a number are treated
almost as extensions. Centrex is
convenient—callers within the system
can reach any phone in the system by
dialing the last four digits, while
outside callers can reach any phone in
the system by dialing all seven digits.
Students pay the regular home phone
rate for a system with some extra
advantages. Unfortunately, some
drawbacks of Centrex have led critics
to call it "second rate phone service."
What's wrong with the system? The
worst problems arise in making contact
with the outside world. During busy
hours or times of crisis, outsiders
dialing in and students dialing 9 to call
out are both rewarded with fast busy
signals, indicating that all the trunk
lines connecting the 491 campus
exchange with the Palo Alto office are
busy.
When questioned, Joe Payne stated
that the phone company "has arranged
to install twenty more trunks" to
handle outside calls. Anyone having
trouble phoning out of the system
should complain to the phone
company, as this problem is fairly
easily solved.
A problem that can't be solved is the
occasional inability of callers to get a
dial tone when they pick up the
receiver. Payne blames the problem of
some students' habit of leaving
receivers off the hook. When this
happens, a branched path through the
maze of telephone connectors is tied up
waiting for the caller to finish dialing.
"It holds the equipment up," Payne
explained. "Under certain
circumstances twenty kids may put out
30 to 40 percent of the
system . . . Then we get
complaints—but the users cause it.
When they leave receivers off the hook,
they're only hurting themselves."

Critics place more of the blame on
the phone company, pointing out that
the dial-tone problems are products of
the outdated equipment used at the
491 exchange. "Some things had to be
ruled out because of expediency,"
Payne admitted. One such feature is the
signal that is received when an ordinary
phone is left off the hook. "They
system wasn't designed for a signal,"
Payne explained.
Phone Company's Rebuttal
The phone company counters these
arguments by urging users to be
satisfied with the service they have. "It
was not economically feasible to
extend regular service to Stanford,"
Payne said, "and we didn't have the
equipment downtown. The alternative
was to have students wait a few years
for service, or use this Centrex system."
But no matter what type of grqwth
problems the phone company has,
Payne stated that regular phone service
wiii be available for Stanford students
by fall 1973. A source who wished to
remain anonymous remarked, "The
phone company will probably
renegotiate with the university and
keep 491 as long as possible." The
reaction from a number of her sources
was "don't hold your breath."
But while problems with the 491
exchange are either correctable or easy
to ignore, more serious problems
develop in Stanford's 321-2300 phone
system. Here the consequences of not
preparing for growth are the fault of
the university, and not the phone
company.
The 2500 or so university extensions
are handled through an eleven-position
switchboard located in a building near
the Old Union. The volume of calls
handled is phenomenal. "Our annual
phone bill for the 321 number is about
a million dollars every year," stated
Olev Killingsworth, Physical Plant

Communications Supervisor. "To
handle the load we do, we should have
fourteen operators on the
switchboard."
321 Problem?
What is the problem with the 321
system? Again, this system is not
prepared to handle growth. Already,
outgoing calls have been given lower
priority than incoming calls, so that
people phoning out may have to wait
for operator assistance. Regular trunks
to the outside (9) and tie lines to San
Jose, San Francisco, Berkeley, San
Carlos, and Hayward frequently
become tied up during peak hours. "As
the university phone network gets
larger, our problems get worse,"
Killingsworth explained.
The ideal solution, according to
Killingsworth, would be to install an
Electronic Switching Centrex system
for the whole university. This system,
he explained, "would put everyone
together." All phones in the
university—in student rooms and
faculty or staff offices—could reach
each other by dialing the last 4 or 5
digits of the number, as in the 491
Centrex system. People calling in would
reach phones directly, without having
to go through a switchboard.
"We've got one of the best-run
university switchboard systems now,
but it's going to go downhill from now
on," Killingsworth stated. "Centrex is
the correct way, the economical way."
Killingsworth estimated that the system
would cost about $800,000 to install,
and would not be ready for another
three years even if ordered
immediately. The plans have been
mai'e, and the final decision rests with
President Lyman's office.
Meanwhile, as more extensions are
installed, the buiden on operators
becomes greater and the quality of
service declines.

preparing for growth are the fault of
the university, and not the phone
company.
The 2500 or so university extensions
are handled through an eleven-position
switchboard located in a building near
the Old Union. The volume of calls
handled is phenomenal. "Our annual
phone bill for the 321 number is about
a million dollars every year," stated
Olev Killingsworth, Physical Plant

Communications Supervisor. "To
handle the load we do, we should have
fourteen operators on the
switchboard."
321 Problem?
What is the problem with the 321
system? Again, this system is not
prepared to handle growth. Already,
outgoing calls have been given lower
priority than incoming calls, so that
people phoning out may have to wait
for operator assistance. Regular trunks
to the outside (9) and tie lines to San
Jose, San Francisco, Berkeley, San
Carlos, and Hayward frequently
become tied up during peak hours. "As
the university phone network gets
larger, our problems get worse,"
Killingsworth explained.
The ideal solution, according to
Killingsworth, would be to install an
Electronic Switching Centrex system
for the whole university. This system,
he explained, "would put everyone
together." All phones in the
university—in student rooms and
faculty or staff offices—could reach
each other by dialing the last 4 or 5
digits of the number, as in the 491
Centrex system. People calling in would
reach phones directly, without having
to go through a switchboard.
"We've got one of the best-run
university switchboard systems now,
but it's going to go downhill from now
on," Killingsworth stated. "Centrex is
the correct way, the economical way."
Killingsworth estimated that the system
would cost about $800,000 to install,
and would not be ready for another
three years even if ordered
immediately. The plans have been
mai'e, and the final decision rests with
President Lyman's office.
Meanwhile, as more extensions are
installed, the buiden on operators
becomes greater and the quality of
service declines.
Although the Budget Adjustment
Program is reducing unnecessary
expenditures and expansion, the
University continues to grow. And that
growth has impaired the efficiency of
the phone systems serving the Stanford
community.
A fast busy signal or no dial tone
occasionally frustrates users of the 491
exchange, while some callers off
Stanford extensions must wait for
service on a critically overloaded
system.
Most students fetl the 491 system
used in dormitory residences is a vast
improvement over the switchboard
network in use until last fall. Under
that system, all calls would be answered
at switchboards located in various parts
of the campus. The operators would
page the room of the recipient of the
call, who would scream
acknowledgement at the paging speaker
and charge down the hall to one of the
dorm phones. Students could have
private phones installed at their own
expense, but few did. Though the
system cost students nothing, it was
inconvenient—except for the operators
who could use the paging system to
listen in on the action in selected
rooms.
In January 1970, the University
decided to tear out the switchboards
and asked that the phone company
provide individual service to student
rooms on campus. The phone company
couldn't handle 2,000 more lines
through the Palo Alto office, so they
installed at Stanford some spare
equipment they had on hand.
"It was an expedient to meet
service," explained Joe Payne, Pacific
Telephone Accounts Manager for
Stanford. "The equipment was put in
on a temporary basis."
Centrix Installed
The service available to students in

university residences is called
Centrex—a system in which the last
four digits of a number are treated
almost as extensions. Centrex is
convenient—callers within the system
can reach any phone in the system by
dialing the last four digits, while
outside callers can reach any phone in
the system by dialing all seven digits.
Students pay the regular home phone
rate for a system with some extra
advantages. Unfortunately, some
drawbacks of Centrex have led critics
to call it "second rate phone service."
What's wrong with the system? The
worst problems arise in making contact
with the outside world. During busy
hours or times of crisis, outsiders
dialing in and students dialing 9 to call
out are both rewarded with fast busy
signals, indicating that all the trunk
lines connecting the 491 campus
exchange with the Palo Alto office are
busy.
When questioned, Joe Payne stated
that the phone company "has arranged
to install twenty more trunks" to
handle outside calls. Anyone having
trouble phoning out of the system
should complain to the phone
company, as this problem is fairly
easily solved.
A problem that can't be solved is the
occasional inability of callers to get a
dial tone when they pick up the
receiver. Payne blames the problem of
some students' habit of leaving
receivers off the hook. When this
happens, a branched path through the
maze of telephone connectors is tied up
waiting for the caller to finish dialing.
"It holds the equipment up," Payne
explained. "Under certain
circumstances twenty kids may put out
30 to 40 percent of the
system . . . Then we get
complaints—but the users cause it.
When they leave receivers off the hook,
they're only hurting themselves."

Critics place more of the blame on
the phone company, pointing out that
the dial-tone problems are products of
the outdated equipment used at the
491 exchange. "Some things had to be
ruled out because of expediency,"
Payne admitted. One such feature is the
signal that is received when an ordinary
phone is left off the hook. "They
system wasn't designed for a signal,"
Payne explained.
Phone Company's Rebuttal
The phone company counters these
arguments by urging users to be
satisfied with the service they have. "It
was not economically feasible to
extend regular service to Stanford,"
Payne said, "and we didn't have the
equipment downtown. The alternative
was to have students wait a few years
for service, or use this Centrex system."
But no matter what type of grqwth
problems the phone company has,
Payne stated that regular phone service
wiii be available for Stanford students
by fall 1973. A source who wished to
remain anonymous remarked, "The
phone company will probably
renegotiate with the university and
keep 491 as long as possible." The
reaction from a number of her sources
was "don't hold your breath."
But while problems with the 491
exchange are either correctable or easy
to ignore, more serious problems
develop in Stanford's 321-2300 phone
system. Here the consequences of not
preparing for growth are the fault of
the university, and not the phone

handle outside calls. Anyone having
trouble phoning out of the system
should complain to the phone
company, as this problem is fairly
easily solved.
A problem that can't be solved is the
occasional inability of callers to get a
dial tone when they pick up the
receiver. Payne blames the problem of
some students' habit of leaving
receivers off the hook. When this
happens, a branched path through the
maze of telephone connectors is tied up
waiting for the caller to finish dialing.
"It holds the equipment up," Payne
explained. "Under certain
circumstances twenty kids may put out
30 to 40 percent of the
system . . . Then we get
complaints—but the users cause it.
When they leave receivers off the hook,
they're only hurting themselves."

Critics place more of the blame on
the phone company, pointing out that
the dial-tone problems are products of
the outdated equipment used at the
491 exchange. "Some things had to be
ruled out because of expediency,"
Payne admitted. One such feature is the
signal that is received when an ordinary
phone is left off the hook. "They
system wasn't designed for a signal,"
Payne explained.
Phone Company's Rebuttal
The phone company counters these
arguments by urging users to be
satisfied with the service they have. "It
was not economically feasible to
extend regular service to Stanford,"
Payne said, "and we didn't have the
equipment downtown. The alternative
was to have students wait a few years
for service, or use this Centrex system."
But no matter what type of grqwth
problems the phone company has,
Payne stated that regular phone service
wiii be available for Stanford students
by fall 1973. A source who wished to
remain anonymous remarked, "The
phone company will probably
renegotiate with the university and
keep 491 as long as possible." The
reaction from a number of her sources
was "don't hold your breath."
But while problems with the 491
exchange are either correctable or easy
to ignore, more serious problems
develop in Stanford's 321-2300 phone
system. Here the consequences of not
preparing for growth are the fault of
the university, and not the phone
company.
The 2500 or so university extensions
are handled through an eleven-position
switchboard located in a building near
the Old Union. The volume of calls
handled is phenomenal. "Our annual
phone bill for the 321 number is about
a million dollars every year," stated
Olev Killingsworth, Physical Plant

Communications Supervisor. "To
handle the load we do, we should have
fourteen operators on the
switchboard."
321 Problem?
What is the problem with the 321
system? Again, this system is not
prepared to handle growth. Already,
outgoing calls have been given lower
priority than incoming calls, so that
people phoning out may have to wait
for operator assistance. Regular trunks
to the outside (9) and tie lines to San
Jose, San Francisco, Berkeley, San
Carlos, and Hayward frequently
become tied up during peak hours. "As
the university phone network gets
larger, our problems get worse,"
Killingsworth explained.
The ideal solution, according to
Killingsworth, would be to install an
Electronic Switching Centrex system
for the whole university. This system,
he explained, "would put everyone
together." All phones in the
university—in student rooms and
faculty or staff offices—could reach
each other by dialing the last 4 or 5
digits of the number, as in the 491
Centrex system. People calling in would
reach phones directly, without having
to go through a switchboard.
"We've got one of the best-run
university switchboard systems now,
but it's going to go downhill from now
on," Killingsworth stated. "Centrex is
the correct way, the economical way."
Killingsworth estimated that the system
would cost about $800,000 to install,
and would not be ready for another
three years even if ordered
immediately. The plans have been
mai'e, and the final decision rests with
President Lyman's office.
Meanwhile, as more extensions are
installed, the buiden on operators
becomes greater and the quality of
service declines.
Although the Budget Adjustment
Program is reducing unnecessary
expenditures and expansion, the
University continues to grow. And that
growth has impaired the efficiency of
the phone systems serving the Stanford
community.
A fast busy signal or no dial tone
occasionally frustrates users of the 491
exchange, while some callers off
Stanford extensions must wait for
service on a critically overloaded
system.
Most students fetl the 491 system
used in dormitory residences is a vast
improvement over the switchboard
network in use until last fall. Under
that system, all calls would be answered
at switchboards located in various parts
of the campus. The operators would
page the room of the recipient of the
call, who would scream
acknowledgement at the paging speaker
and charge down the hall to one of the
dorm phones. Students could have
private phones installed at their own
expense, but few did. Though the
system cost students nothing, it was
inconvenient—except for the operators
who could use the paging system to
listen in on the action in selected
rooms.
In January 1970, the University
decided to tear out the switchboards
and asked that the phone company
provide individual service to student
rooms on campus. The phone company
couldn't handle 2,000 more lines
through the Palo Alto office, so they
installed at Stanford some spare
equipment they had on hand.
"It was an expedient to meet
service," explained Joe Payne, Pacific
Telephone Accounts Manager for
Stanford. "The equipment was put in
on a temporary basis."
Centrix Installed
The service available to students in

university residences is called
Centrex—a system in which the last
four digits of a number are treated
almost as extensions. Centrex is
convenient—callers within the system
can reach any phone in the system by
dialing the last four digits, while
outside callers can reach any phone in
the system by dialing all seven digits.
Students pay the regular home phone
rate for a system with some extra
advantages. Unfortunately, some
drawbacks of Centrex have led critics
to call it "second rate phone service."
What's wrong with the system? The
worst problems arise in making contact
with the outside world. During busy
hours or times of crisis, outsiders
dialing in and students dialing 9 to call
out are both rewarded with fast busy
signals, indicating that all the trunk
lines connecting the 491 campus
exchange with the Palo Alto office are
busy.
