By issuing last Thursday a statement of
University policy on disruptions, President
Richard Lyman has finally given a blanket
answer to the question "Why did you bust
this sit-in?", a question asked at many times
after police have cleared a campus building.
It is dubious, however, if there is any real
wisdom in making a statement of policy
based on generalized assumptions about
both the nature of the University and the
nature of a sit-in.
The policy, Lyman states, "derives from
the very idea of the University and the way
in which it must conduct its affairs." He
asks us to accept the policy as "a necessary
part of the conception of the University as
a place of reason, not force." In effect, this
asks us to think of the University as an
institution apart from the grimy,
unpleasant realities of the world. Yet how
is this institution, which is a major
Midpcninsula employer, a major
land-holder and land-developer, and a
major investor, different from any of
America's other institutions in its impact
on people's lives?
"Coercive" is the word Lyman uses to
describe sit-ins in his policy statement. He
is absolutely right; sit-ins are by nature
coercive. They were originally designed to

coerce institutions which could not be
moved by the "constructive roads" lie
speaks of. And, when they originated and
were used as a tactic of the Freedom Riders
in the South, they were usually peaceful,
until police came. Sit-ins are not necessarily
a uniformly good tactic, nor are they
always peaceful- they have evolved a great
deal since the late 50's and early 60's. But
they are also not necessarily violent, and
there are times when the peaceful coercion
of a sit-in can be effective in making an
unresponsive institution—the University
like any other-respond when the
"constructive roads" have failed. The new
policy statement totally disregards this
potential.
It is also crucial to recognize what
alternatives you are bringing to the fore
when you rule the tactic of a • sit-in
unacceptable. Many people may accept this
ruling and turn back to try again the
"constructive roads" of change. Others,
too, may decide that the sit-in is
ineffectual—since it does not bring enough
force to bear on the University. When the
administration seems to be blind to the
difference between violence and
non-violence, it seems far less likely that
those opposing administration policies will
make a distinction between the two.
