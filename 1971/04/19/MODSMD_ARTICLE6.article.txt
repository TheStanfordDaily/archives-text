# 'institutional orthodoxy' exists
## Myth Of The Neutral University 
### 
Hubert marshall

In a recent issue of the Daily a number of faculty members
indicated their opposition to "the taking of institutional positions by
the University ... on matters not related directly to the proper
functioning of the University." "Political expression by the
University," they hold, "is improper and harmful as a matter of
policy." In particular, it appears, they object to recent Academic
Senate resolutions that are critical of this country's military
involvement in Indochina.
I share to some degree these faculty members' concern over the
passage of political resolutions by the Senate, but I am troubled by
their repeated assertions that a university ought to be, or, indeed, can
be neutral or disinterested, or that it can avoid any political
expression whatever. Was Stanford University neutral during the
decades that it devoted its resources and lent the sanction of its
academic credit to ROTC;
ROTC Not Neutral
During those long years the University put its stamp of approval on
training young men to kill foreigners on behalf of American foreign
policy. This may appear "disinterested" to Americans whose
perceptions are warped by the nationalism that infects most of us, but
it will scarcely appear neutral to the people of Indochina who are
daily bombed into oblivion by the graduates of Stanford ROTC.
The signers of the Daily statement are concerned that the taking of
institutional positions will adversely affect academic freedom, and
specifically that it will "create an institutional orthodoxy which ... is
inconsistent with the University's fundamental commitment to
continual critical search for truth." But this, of course, is nonsense.
Has Stanford's strong institutional commitment to ROTC (including
the unremitting support of its recent Presidents) had a chilling effect
on the campus anti-war movement?To pose the question is to answer
it.
BYU Severance
Stanford's commitment to the American military establishment is
by no means its only political commitment. Two years ago Stanford
severed athletic relations with Brigham Young University because of

that institution's relationship with the Mormon Church, whose
policies were held by Stanford officials to be racist. A more political
act could hardly be imagined. Moreover, the announcement of the
new policy was given national publicity by the media precisely
because it was an act by the University and not a mere resolution by
the Academic Senate. Yet has this political act by the University
created an "institutional orthodoxy" which has prevented Professor
Shockley from continuing his speaking research from a point of view
that many members of the community consider to be racist?
Wherever one looks, the University reveals the lack of
"disinterestedness." For years our admissions policy gave preference
to the white, upper-middle classes who are adept at passing
standardized tests constructed by white, upper-middle class
psychologists. As a consequence we stood with Princeton in having
one of the most uniform (and uniformly uninteresting) student bodies
among the major universities. Was this neutralityTToday we have an
admissions policy that admits minority students on the basis of
criteria that differ from those applied to whites. Is this policy in any
sense non-political?
Hayden Ignored
When Tom Hayden comes to this campus he is ignored by
University officials (other than the police). But when Ambassador
Lodge comes he is treated as an honored guest. Is it disinterested to
treat a revolutionary one way and a war criminal another?And do
these actions by University officials not convey a message as clearly as
would a resolution by the Academic Senate?
The signers of the Daily statement express their fear that we may
create an institutional orthodoxy. What they fail to sense is that we
already have one. The instructional staffs in nearly half the
educational institutions in the world are predominantly Marxist. The
Stanford faculty, to the best of my knowledge, contains only two
professing Marxists. The fact that the Stanford faculty do not have to
sign a loyalty oath or pledge allegiance every morning to capitalism,
does not make it less true that on this campus an orthodoxy
inevitably exists.
A convincing case can be made for the restrained and infrequent
passage of "political" resolutions by the Academic Senate. But that
case cannot be sustained by references to "disinterestedness" and the
dangers of creating an "institutional orthodoxy." Most important
institutions quite faithfully serve the prevailing centers of power in
the larger society, and Stanford is no exception. The neutrality of the
University is a myth. The sooner we admit it, the sooner we can
proceed to a productive discussion of what positions the University
ought to take, and when.
