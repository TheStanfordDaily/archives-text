saving face
Editor, THE DAILY:
The real reason there was
violence at the Med Center is that
the need to "save face" to not
appear to be backing down in the
face of force—was valued too
highly by both sides.
Had the Administration simply
appointed an officer to preside
over grievance procedures
immediately, instead of tying this
action to the vacation of the
offices, the demonstrators
probably would have left that
evening and business could have
continued in the offices next day
without resort to violence.
Instead, police were called the
offices were wrecked, people were
hurt, tensions have been raised,
and issues obfuscated.
Had the demonstrators left the
offices when warned to do so by
the police—violence still could
have been avoided. The

demonstrators refused to leave,
however, because to do so would
have been to show weakness.
A preoccupation with "saving
face" exacerbates any conflict
when it appears in either party to
the conflict. It is disastrous when
it appears in both parties.
Because the legitimacy of the
University's power position is
generally well recognized, I hope
that in future conflicts (and in the
resolution of the current one), the
Administration will not allow
itself to value face saving above
problem solving.

duress
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the matter of the destructive
riot in the Stanford Hospital on
Friday evening, April 9,1 see with
a growing sense of frustration that
the well-known methods of
agit-prop are having their effects. I
was present during the melee as a
neutral observer for the faculty.
Without going into the merits of
fhe case that brought about the
sit-in, it is a fact well known to at
least 50 onlookers and official
observers that the institution and
the police called upon the
sitters-in to leave peacefully and
without charge or arrest, and that
the prying-loose came about when
this request was defied.
I know also from conversation
with professionals stationed on or
visiting the adjoining ward-wings
that patients were very much
disturbed through the 30 hours of
tension generated by 70 or 80
irresponsible squatters, ranging
from young high schoolers up,
crowding the contiguous area.
Further, despite the air of
innocence with which it is claimed
that negotiations were on the
verge of being concluded when
the police arrived, in fact the
demonstrators refused to budge
unless their demand was met in
their way, i.e., by a "hearing" on
the case at issue carried out
immediately and in their presence.
In face of these facts, there
comes the usual clamor about the
heartlessness of administrators
who took steps to deal with an
impossible stalemate in a
(hospital) setting where this
situation could not be permitted
to continue. To turn for a
moment to personal comment — I
know very few people in any walk
of life who have the sensitivity,
patience and fair-mindedness of
Dean Wilson and Dr. Gonda,
Director of the Hospital, and
these qualities have been and
continue to be paramount in their
efforts to deal with the

"non-negotiable" emotionality
generated during the past week.
It is almost unfortunate that
these major facts become lost in
the concluding paragraphs of
public reports of events
submerged by the raucous and
sometimes violent voices and acts
of the demonstrators and their
supporters. I know of no one in
the Medical School or the
University who doesn't want to
see justice done in the case at
issue, but arriving at conclusions
under duress is something to
which some of us would refuse to

Editor, THE DAILY:
To understand the significance
of all the events around the
Stanford Hospital recently, one
has to examine what the essence
of the stakes are over the firings
of Sam Bridges and Dr. Aguilar.
Stanford Hospital is owned by the
Board of Trustees and retained by
them for the same reason that
they hold Hewlitt-Packard,
Dillingham and FMC - to make
money. Poor people find it
difficult to receive care there as
hospital rooms cost from $75 to
$200 a day. Poor Black people
like Sam Bridges are only
supposed to work there. The fact
that the U.S. has one of the
highest infant and maternal
mortality rates and its people one
of the lowest life expectancies of
all the industrial societies is worth
reflecting on.
The facilities of the Hospital
are geared to serve the well-to-do
— few poor people receive heart
transplants and many aren't even
admitted to the Hospital through
the emergency room because they
can't pay. Moreover, there are
limits apparently to how far a
doctor can go in using his energies
in other directions - as caring for
the needs of his community. The
institutionalization of racism at
Stanford is essential to the
continuation of Stanford Hospital
as an imperialistic, profit-making
organization.
President Lyman claims having
police break up a peaceful sit-in
was only in the interests of the
patients. Even if this were true it
would already reveal his racism as
the Hospital in no way serves the
needs of all the people, and
Lyman is only concerned with the
constituency that keeps him in
power.
Secondly, of course, police
were called not for the patients'
sake but because the prospect of

Black and Brown people
organizing for political power was
too dangerous, both to the
profit-making of Stanford and td
the perpetuation of myth that
Stanford Hospital was some sort
of benevolent and philanthopic
institution.
In the past the student
anti-war, anti-imperialist struggle
has been directed at the
war-making facilities of the
campus and the war-profiteering
of the Trustees. Today there
exists a Black and Brown student,
workers' and community struggle
against a racist and imperialistic,
institution within the University
which doesn't profit from the war
or contribute to it directly, but
exploits people right in our own
country.
The system of imperialism
affects every facet of U.S.
domestic and foreign relations. It
exploits people abroad in a
manner similar to its methods at
home. Racism is one of its
supporting pillars. You cannot
smash one without smashing the
other.

violence at the Med Center is that
the need to "save face" to not
appear to be backing down in the
face of force—was valued too
highly by both sides.
Had the Administration simply
appointed an officer to preside
over grievance procedures
immediately, instead of tying this
action to the vacation of the
offices, the demonstrators
probably would have left that
evening and business could have
continued in the offices next day
without resort to violence.
Instead, police were called the
offices were wrecked, people were
hurt, tensions have been raised,
and issues obfuscated.
Had the demonstrators left the
offices when warned to do so by
the police—violence still could
have been avoided. The

demonstrators refused to leave,
however, because to do so would
have been to show weakness.
A preoccupation with "saving
face" exacerbates any conflict
when it appears in either party to
the conflict. It is disastrous when
it appears in both parties.
Because the legitimacy of the
University's power position is
generally well recognized, I hope
that in future conflicts (and in the

duress
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the matter of the destructive
riot in the Stanford Hospital on
Friday evening, April 9,1 see with
a growing sense of frustration that
the well-known methods of
agit-prop are having their effects. I
was present during the melee as a
neutral observer for the faculty.
Without going into the merits of
fhe case that brought about the
sit-in, it is a fact well known to at
least 50 onlookers and official
observers that the institution and
the police called upon the
sitters-in to leave peacefully and
without charge or arrest, and that
the prying-loose came about when
this request was defied.
I know also from conversation
with professionals stationed on or
visiting the adjoining ward-wings
that patients were very much
disturbed through the 30 hours of
tension generated by 70 or 80
irresponsible squatters, ranging
from young high schoolers up,
crowding the contiguous area.
Further, despite the air of
innocence with which it is claimed
that negotiations were on the
verge of being concluded when
the police arrived, in fact the
demonstrators refused to budge
unless their demand was met in
their way, i.e., by a "hearing" on
the case at issue carried out
immediately and in their presence.
In face of these facts, there
comes the usual clamor about the
heartlessness of administrators
who took steps to deal with an
impossible stalemate in a
(hospital) setting where this
situation could not be permitted
to continue. To turn for a
moment to personal comment — I
know very few people in any walk
of life who have the sensitivity,
patience and fair-mindedness of
Dean Wilson and Dr. Gonda,
Director of the Hospital, and
these qualities have been and
continue to be paramount in their
efforts to deal with the

"non-negotiable" emotionality
generated during the past week.
It is almost unfortunate that
these major facts become lost in
the concluding paragraphs of
public reports of events
submerged by the raucous and
sometimes violent voices and acts
of the demonstrators and their
supporters. I know of no one in
the Medical School or the

Editor, THE DAILY:
To understand the significance
of all the events around the
Stanford Hospital recently, one
has to examine what the essence
of the stakes are over the firings
of Sam Bridges and Dr. Aguilar.
Stanford Hospital is owned by the
Board of Trustees and retained by
them for the same reason that
they hold Hewlitt-Packard,
Dillingham and FMC - to make
money. Poor people find it
difficult to receive care there as
hospital rooms cost from $75 to
$200 a day. Poor Black people
like Sam Bridges are only
supposed to work there. The fact
that the U.S. has one of the
highest infant and maternal
mortality rates and its people one
of the lowest life expectancies of
all the industrial societies is worth
reflecting on.
The facilities of the Hospital
are geared to serve the well-to-do
— few poor people receive heart
transplants and many aren't even
admitted to the Hospital through
the emergency room because they
can't pay. Moreover, there are
limits apparently to how far a
doctor can go in using his energies
in other directions - as caring for
the needs of his community. The
institutionalization of racism at
Stanford is essential to the
continuation of Stanford Hospital
as an imperialistic, profit-making
organization.
President Lyman claims having
police break up a peaceful sit-in
was only in the interests of the
patients. Even if this were true it
would already reveal his racism as
the Hospital in no way serves the
needs of all the people, and
Lyman is only concerned with the
constituency that keeps him in
power.
Secondly, of course, police
were called not for the patients'
sake but because the prospect of

Black and Brown people
organizing for political power was
too dangerous, both to the
profit-making of Stanford and td
the perpetuation of myth that
Stanford Hospital was some sort
of benevolent and philanthopic
institution.
In the past the student
anti-war, anti-imperialist struggle
has been directed at the
war-making facilities of the
campus and the war-profiteering
of the Trustees. Today there
exists a Black and Brown student,
workers' and community struggle
against a racist and imperialistic,
institution within the University
which doesn't profit from the war
or contribute to it directly, but
exploits people right in our own
country.
The system of imperialism
affects every facet of U.S.
domestic and foreign relations. It
exploits people abroad in a
manner similar to its methods at
home. Racism is one of its
supporting pillars. You cannot
smash one without smashing the

appear to be backing down in the
face of force—was valued too
highly by both sides.
Had the Administration simply
appointed an officer to preside
over grievance procedures
immediately, instead of tying this
action to the vacation of the
offices, the demonstrators
probably would have left that
evening and business could have
continued in the offices next day
without resort to violence.
Instead, police were called the
offices were wrecked, people were
hurt, tensions have been raised,
and issues obfuscated.
Had the demonstrators left the
offices when warned to do so by
the police—violence still could
have been avoided. The

demonstrators refused to leave,
however, because to do so would
have been to show weakness.
A preoccupation with "saving
face" exacerbates any conflict
when it appears in either party to
the conflict. It is disastrous when
it appears in both parties.
Because the legitimacy of the
University's power position is
generally well recognized, I hope
that in future conflicts (and in the
resolution of the current one), the
Administration will not allow
itself to value face saving above
problem solving.

duress
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the matter of the destructive
riot in the Stanford Hospital on
Friday evening, April 9,1 see with
a growing sense of frustration that
the well-known methods of
agit-prop are having their effects. I
was present during the melee as a
neutral observer for the faculty.
Without going into the merits of
fhe case that brought about the
sit-in, it is a fact well known to at
least 50 onlookers and official
observers that the institution and
the police called upon the
sitters-in to leave peacefully and
without charge or arrest, and that
the prying-loose came about when
this request was defied.
I know also from conversation
with professionals stationed on or
visiting the adjoining ward-wings
that patients were very much
disturbed through the 30 hours of
tension generated by 70 or 80
irresponsible squatters, ranging
from young high schoolers up,
crowding the contiguous area.
Further, despite the air of
innocence with which it is claimed
that negotiations were on the
verge of being concluded when
the police arrived, in fact the
demonstrators refused to budge
unless their demand was met in
their way, i.e., by a "hearing" on
the case at issue carried out
immediately and in their presence.
In face of these facts, there
comes the usual clamor about the
heartlessness of administrators
who took steps to deal with an
impossible stalemate in a
(hospital) setting where this
situation could not be permitted
to continue. To turn for a
moment to personal comment — I
know very few people in any walk
of life who have the sensitivity,
patience and fair-mindedness of
Dean Wilson and Dr. Gonda,
Director of the Hospital, and
these qualities have been and
continue to be paramount in their
efforts to deal with the

"non-negotiable" emotionality
generated during the past week.
It is almost unfortunate that
these major facts become lost in
the concluding paragraphs of
public reports of events
submerged by the raucous and
sometimes violent voices and acts
of the demonstrators and their
supporters. I know of no one in
the Medical School or the
University who doesn't want to
see justice done in the case at
issue, but arriving at conclusions
under duress is something to
which some of us would refuse to
accede.

Editor, THE DAILY:
To understand the significance
of all the events around the
Stanford Hospital recently, one
has to examine what the essence
of the stakes are over the firings
of Sam Bridges and Dr. Aguilar.
Stanford Hospital is owned by the
Board of Trustees and retained by
them for the same reason that
they hold Hewlitt-Packard,
Dillingham and FMC - to make
money. Poor people find it
difficult to receive care there as
hospital rooms cost from $75 to
$200 a day. Poor Black people
like Sam Bridges are only
supposed to work there. The fact
that the U.S. has one of the
highest infant and maternal
mortality rates and its people one
of the lowest life expectancies of
all the industrial societies is worth
reflecting on.
The facilities of the Hospital
are geared to serve the well-to-do
— few poor people receive heart
transplants and many aren't even
admitted to the Hospital through
the emergency room because they
can't pay. Moreover, there are
limits apparently to how far a
doctor can go in using his energies
in other directions - as caring for
the needs of his community. The
institutionalization of racism at
Stanford is essential to the
continuation of Stanford Hospital
as an imperialistic, profit-making
organization.
President Lyman claims having
police break up a peaceful sit-in
was only in the interests of the
patients. Even if this were true it
would already reveal his racism as
the Hospital in no way serves the
needs of all the people, and
Lyman is only concerned with the
constituency that keeps him in
power.
Secondly, of course, police
were called not for the patients'
sake but because the prospect of

Black and Brown people
organizing for political power was
too dangerous, both to the
profit-making of Stanford and td
the perpetuation of myth that
Stanford Hospital was some sort
of benevolent and philanthopic
institution.
In the past the student
anti-war, anti-imperialist struggle
has been directed at the
war-making facilities of the
campus and the war-profiteering
of the Trustees. Today there
exists a Black and Brown student,
workers' and community struggle
against a racist and imperialistic,
institution within the University
which doesn't profit from the war
or contribute to it directly, but
exploits people right in our own
country.
The system of imperialism
affects every facet of U.S.
domestic and foreign relations. It
exploits people abroad in a
manner similar to its methods at
home. Racism is one of its
supporting pillars. You cannot
smash one without smashing the
other.
