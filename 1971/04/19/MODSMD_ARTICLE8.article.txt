FIRE BASE O'DAILY, April 18
— Another crucial,
stomach-churning week in the
continuing saga of Stanford
University starring Dick Lyman
and a cast of thousands seems to
be upon us. For, this week:
—the crisis down at the
Hospital seemingly will come to a
head at 9:00 a.m. today, the
deadline set by several coalition
groups for a favorable University
response to some 11 demands
related to the hiring and the rights
of minority workers;
—the 20 adults, including some
six Stanford students, will be
arraigned at 10 a.m. Tuesday for
their alleged roles in the Hospital
sit-in two weekends ago;
—warrant fever, a mysterious
disease that infects the campus
from time to time, but especially
during the spring term, may
reappear following the "cure" of
what lawmen might term a
"massive infection" at the
hospital;
—pressure will continue to
build, and the rhetoric become
livelier, in anticipation of the
planned anti-war demonstrations
in San Francisco and Washington,
D.C. and the 17-day "spring
offensive" to again focus
attention on this country's role in
Indochina;
—the elusive affidavit that
forms the basis for last week's
unprecedented search of the Daily
offices must become a matter of
public record;
—and, historically speaking,
this week marks the anniversary
of the first of the 1970 Old Union
sit-ins, during which 23 persons
were arrested and after which
several hundred persons roamed
the campus trashing sheriff's
deputies and scores of windows.
Reruns
To many, all of this sounds like
a rerun of that favorite old
television flick, "Where Were You
When The Shit Hit The Fan?" To
others, it represents a strong
potential—if not an immediate

threat—of bodily harm; to others,
the "politics of confrontation"
represents the opportunity for
political gain—or loss; and to still
others, it provides a good excuse
to head for the beach or the
Fillmore.
What may come of the week?
—A workers' strike or other
action, starting at the Hospital
and perhaps spreading to other
points on the campus, is one
possibility. Unlike May of last
year, this one wouldn't be a
student strike, and would
probably be much harder for the
administration to deal with. Last
year, President Pitzer cooled the
campus somewhat by making
Friday Saturday, but it's
questionable whether this tactic
will work with the various
employee coalitions.
—Guerilla warfare (also known
as People's War). There were two
firebombings last week, one at the
police station and the other at the
PG&E substation across from the
Women's Gym. Bomb scares have
become commonplace—but not
routine—at many locations on
campus.
—A few more students may
suddenly find themselves subject
to the tender mercies of the Palo
Alto Police Department for their
alleged roles in the hospital
"infection."
—Another sit-in or other type
of massive civil disobedience.
Despite President Lyman's
statements to the faculty Senate
Thursday, sit-ins, "mobile
militant" or otherwise, are always
an interesting possibility.
Organizing?
—Intense dorm organizing
and/or mass meetings such as the
type that preceeded last year's
various Moritoriums is highly
likely. After all, who can resist
those wonderful lunchtime rallies
underneath a broiling sun?
—The Daily could be raided
again by officers of the peace
seeking to identify people through
its photographic files or other
records. (Big Brother may not be
watching you, but he sure as hell
isn't ignoring us . . .)

—Nothing, simply nothing. It
could be a normal school week,
with most students fulfilling
Provost Miller's ferverent prayer
that students on the whole have
decided to get back to studying.
Well, it's getting on toward
dark. As one sage here in the Nam
frequently remarks, "The night
time is the right time."
"INCOMING!" I hear, and I
dive for my air-conditioned
bunker.
So it goes. Another Stanford
spring.
