# This Land Is Your Land?

### CRAIG NORDLUND 
With the Livingston and Blayney land use
"Policy/Plan" as primary targets, representatives from
18 local community action groups struck out at the
lack of public voice and power to prevent the
"overdevelopment" of industry on Midpeninsula
lands.
The group also cited was Stanford's obligation to
provide more low and moderate income housing and
the "Policy/Plan's" seeming evasion of this
responsibility.
In an open meeting held last night in the Meyer
Library Forum room, the president's committee on
land and building development, chaired by Professor
D. M. Mason, tried to respond to the questions and
problems posed by these various interest groups.
Each group presented a position paper to the
committee and the discussion which ensued centered
basically on the conflict between financial gain for
the University and the overdevelopment and traffic
congestion which would result from the construction
of a new industrial park on the Sand Hill Road-SLAC
site.
Vocal Opposition
The most vocal opposition came from Peter Sly
and Ida Morris, co-chairmen of the "Citizens Against

the Willow Expressway." In their words, the
"Policy/Plan" is a "blueprint for the destruction of
our precious foothills." Their position paper called
for "no further industrial development in the
foothills," and continued with a suggestion that all
"future industrial development in the midpeninsula
should be located in the Black community east of
Bayshore, where jobs and tax base are needed most."
This request was echoed by Marvin Washington,
spokesman for the "East Palo Alto Welfare Rights
Organization." Washington stated that the proposed
industrial park would necessitate the construction of
the Willow Expressway which would force people out
of the East Palo Alto community and would also
encourage long distance commuting which would
only add to the traffic problem.
He cited the need for jobs and low cost housing in
the Black community and stated that their needs
would be better served if industry were to develop on
the 100 acres available in the east Bayshore
community where workers could walk to their jobs.
This also brought up the question of development
of a rapid transit system. According to Peter Sly, such
a system, if developed would most likely follow the
route of the Bayshore Freeway or the Union Pacific
tracks. Thus, he recommended that any future
industrial development be olaced within easy access

to public transportation which would exclude
development on Stanford's foothill lands.
Effective Decisions
Considerable time was spent on the issue of
whether or not these hearings could possibly affect
the decision of the trustees. All the group spokesmen
felt that the trustees should attend these open
meetings to discuss the sentiments of the surrounding
communities. It was largely felt that any decision
made by Stanford on land development would have a
great effect on its neighbors and that the trustees
should not be allowed to make their decision in
ignorance of its ramifications.
A spokesman for "Community House," felt that
Stanford should commit itself to building 2000 low
and middle-income housing units. "The change
toward racial and social justice in this country," he
said, "costs money and although it is a hard
fact. . . Stanford must not try to worm out of its
responsibility."
Most groups agreed that regional planning rather
than small area planning was the answer to many of
the problems. The meeting was adjourned due to the
late hour before everyone had had a chance to air
their views. Another meeting will be scheduled for
next Monday night with the time and place to be
announced later this week.
