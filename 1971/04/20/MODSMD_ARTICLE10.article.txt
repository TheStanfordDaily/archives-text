# 'Chicago' Rocks Huge Crowd

### CAPTAIN HORNSBY 
Question: What makes a drum
solo good?
Answer: 8,000 people wanting
to hear a drum solo.
Sometimes I wish Ginger Bak
er had never thought of "Toad."
One of these times was last
Friday night at Maples Pavilion,
when the drummer for Madura, a
three-man, one-song group travel
ing with Chicago, launched into
the ritual.
The other two members of
Madura are an organist, who
played the organ bass pedals most
of the time, but switched to bass
guitar for one number, and a lead
guitarist.
Evidently all three musicians^

have listened to quite a bit of
jazz, and they seemed most at
home while playing some form of
upbeat, urban blues.
The organist had a number of
Jimmy Smith riffs in his
repertoire. The guitarist never
seemed to grow tired of
grunt-humming in unison with his
guitar, a la Winters, Hendrix,
Stills.
Their use of dynamics was
limited to two modes: (a) from
loud with a beat to lounder with
no beat, and (b) from bedlam to a
sustained guitar note.
At the present time, Madura is
not on the verge of becoming a
super-group. It's not so much that
tntftieians are without

skill, as that they are without
taste and imagination.
By the way, Chicago
performed, too. And performed
quite well, getting decidedly
better as they went along.
The first four or five songs
were badly marred by sound
problems. Acoustically, Maples
Pavilion is a nice building for
basketball.
Unfortunately, it's terrible for
bass guitars, and not much better
for trumpet, saxophone, and
trombone. Eventually, whoever
was manning the sound panel
succeeded in clearing up the
jumble of four voices and three
horns.
Chicago played a long and
varied 15-song set, drawing on
material from all three of their
double-LP albums. The audience
seemed to be most
enthusiastically familiar with
songs from their first album such
as "Beginnings" and "Does
Anybody Really Know What
Time It Is," but the entire
selection was well received.
One of Chicago's strongest
points is their ability to play in
many rock styles.
They can drive hard, as in '25
or 6 to 4" and "I'm a Man;" they
can be very soft as in organist
Robert Lamm's impressionistic
piano introduction to "What
Time It Is;" they use jazz
rudiments effectively in some
fairly sophisticated horn charts,
as in "Sing a Mean Tune Kid" and
"Make Me Smile;" and they can
be rhythmically overpowering
when the horn section switches to

claves, maraccas, tambourine and
cowbell.
Guitarist Terry Kath has a
remarkable ability to combine
rhythm and lead guitar playing;
his picking hand is a blur
throughout every song. Drummer
Daniel Seraphine has the blessed
good sense to know when to play
quietly and simply.
As I mentioned, Chicago got
better as they went along,
finishing up with an encore
combination of "I'm a Man" and
"I Just Want to be Free." The
horn section was at its best in this
last song, including a fine sax sole
by Walter Parazuider.
The encore was solid, powerful
rock and the mysticism of the
jazz-rock label notwithstanding,
Chicago is basically a fine rock
band.
