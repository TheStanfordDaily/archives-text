Vietnam Drug Addiction
SAIGON — Two U.S. congressman said yesterday 10 to 15
percent of American troops in Vietnam-30,000-40,000
men-use high-grade heroin and addiction is of epidemic
proportions.
They are Rep. Morgan Murphy, D-111., and Rep. Robert
H. Steel, R-Conn., sent out by the House Foreign Affairs
Committee to look into the drug problem around the
world.
They have visited Turkey, chief supplier of opium for
the illicit U.S. market, Iran, and Laos and Thailand, the
latter two a major source of heroin supplies in Vietnam.
Murphy and Steel blamed corrupt Vietnamese officials
and said the South Vietnamese government has done little
about the problem.
They quoted the heroin use figures given them by the
U.S. Command and added that 60 to 90 U.S. soldiers died
from overdoses last year.
Soviets Launch New Complex
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union has orbited the first phase
of what informed sources said would be a complex space
spectacular involving several cosmonauts and at least two
more spacecraft.
Details were kept secret, as usual in the Soviet space
program, but the semiofficial sources said the mission

would be part of the long-range Soviet aim of building an
orbiting space station.
Yesterday's launching initiated a new type of unmanned
craft, the Salute, possibly the first of a series. It was
described officially only as an "orbital scientific station."
The shape of its orbit, however, put it in a path to receive
more craft for joint maneuvers.
Boy Found Crucified
SAN FRANCISCO — The nude body of an 18-month-old
boy was found yesterday tied to a wooden cross in a
basement used by neighborhood boys for a "clubhouse,"
police reported.
The body of Noah S. Alba, who disappeared last
Wednesday while on an outing with his mother at a park
two blocks away, was hidden beneath bed sheets, Police Lt.
Charles Ellis said.
Two brothers, aged 7 and 10, are being held after
admitting taking the youngster to the basement and
"playing with him," Ellis said.
There were marks on the body indicating the youngster
might have been kicked, Ellis said, but pinpointing the
cause of death will await an autopsy. However, he said
investigators believe the child died the day he disappeared.
Noah and his 3-year-old sister, Symanie, went to Alta
Plaza park at Clay and Steiner streets with his mother,
Melanie Alba, 21.
