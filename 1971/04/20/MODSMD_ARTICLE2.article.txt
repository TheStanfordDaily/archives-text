# Gonda Answers Minority Demands
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN WARD HEADSTROM 
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, director of
the Stanford University Hospital,
formally responded for the University
yesterday morning to a list of eleven
demands presented to the University
last Wednesday by the Stanford
Employees Coalition.
Reading from a prepared statement
before a crowd of nearly 300, mostly
Medical Center employees, Gonda
made few concessions and generally
reiterated earlier University statements.
Speaking to the demand that
dismissed black hospital employee Sam
Bridges be reinstated and reimbursed
retroactively, Gonda stated, "Mr.
Bridges has responded to the Hospital
proposal to conduct an accelerated
grievance procedure, which is expected
to begin later this week."
Gonda made formal the
announcement that Henry Organ of the
General Secretary's Office would serve

as the hearing officer in the final stages
of a simplified grievance procedure.
Responding to the demand that Dr.
Jose Aguilar be granted tenure, Gonda
re-stated the University and Hospital
position of some weeks.
No Recommendation
"The Department of Surgery, which
has responsibility and professional
capability in this matter, has carefully
reviewed Dr. Aguilar's faculty status on
several occasions and has concluded
that it cannot recommend Dr. Aguilar's
re-appointment or promotion to the
full-time faculty ..." Gonda said.
The first of the eleven demands
presented last Wednesday to Provost
William F. Miller on the lawn in front
of the Med Center asked that charges
related to all persons who were arrested
in connection with the April 9 Medical
Center sit-in and eventual police bust
be dropped.
Gonda noted simply that the charges

were issued by the District Attorney of
Santa Clara County. "The University is
not a party to those cases," Gonda
noted.
Clear Opportunity
"It must be recalled," he stated,
"that those who were arrested were
given a clear opportunity to leave the
corridor before the arrests were made.
When they failed to do so, the matter
passed out of our hands and it is now
entirely in the authority of the District
Attorney."
Provost Miller spoke briefly at the
9:00 rally. He emphasized that Dr.
Gonda "has the responsibility for the
Hospital and he has the authority and
responsibility to deal with those
problems that rest within the
Hospital."
Miller did respond to the fourth
demand—that John L. Wilson resign as
acting Dean of the Medical School.
"Both the President and I strongly

re-affirm our confidence in Dr. Wilson
as Acting Dean and Executive Officer
of the Medical Center," Miller noted.
Toilet Privledges
Gonda, in responding to other
demands, stated that Stanford would
not assume any liability for medical
expenses and injuries to demonstrators
in the April 9 demonstration, and that
in the future rest rooms for employees
would not be classified by jobs and
only by 'male' and 'female' designation.
Gonda agreed, in response to the
seventh demand, that four voting places
on the Administrative Council of the
Hospital be filled by Black and Latin
delegates. "I am of the opinion,"
Gonda stated, "that the advisory input
of a broadly representative group of
employees would be in the best
interests of the Hospital."
He also noted that the Hospital will
accelerate completion and
implementation of a new centralized
job classification system, the substance
of the eleventh demand.
Internal Disunity
There was no immediate response to
Gonda's prepared statement in response
to the eleven demands. At the rally,
James Cheatham of the Black Advisory
Council said he was 'disappointed' in
the University's responses. There
seemed to be some internal disunity
among the hospital workers as to future
action.
Both the Black Advisory Council
and the Alianza Latina held meetings
yesterday afternoon. At both meetings
there was talk of possible job actions
within the Medical Center, but no
formal statement was prepared. The
Alianza Latina will hold a meeting for
Latin workers this morning at 10:00.
The Black Liberation Front (BLF)
announced Sunday in Serra House
lounge that workers might engage in a
slowdown strike if their demands were
not met by the University.

Latin workers this morning at 10:00.
The Black Liberation Front (BLF)
announced Sunday in Serra House
lounge that workers might engage in a
slowdown strike if their demands were
not met by the University.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, director of
the Stanford University Hospital,
formally responded for the University
yesterday morning to a list of eleven
demands presented to the University
last Wednesday by the Stanford
Employees Coalition.
Reading from a prepared statement
before a crowd of nearly 300, mostly
Medical Center employees, Gonda
made few concessions and generally
reiterated earlier University statements.
Speaking to the demand that
dismissed black hospital employee Sam
Bridges be reinstated and reimbursed
retroactively, Gonda stated, "Mr.
Bridges has responded to the Hospital
proposal to conduct an accelerated
grievance procedure, which is expected
to begin later this week."
Gonda made formal the
announcement that Henry Organ of the
General Secretary's Office would serve

as the hearing officer in the final stages
of a simplified grievance procedure.
Responding to the demand that Dr.
Jose Aguilar be granted tenure, Gonda
re-stated the University and Hospital
position of some weeks.
No Recommendation
"The Department of Surgery, which
has responsibility and professional
capability in this matter, has carefully
reviewed Dr. Aguilar's faculty status on
several occasions and has concluded
that it cannot recommend Dr. Aguilar's
re-appointment or promotion to the
full-time faculty ..." Gonda said.
The first of the eleven demands
presented last Wednesday to Provost
William F. Miller on the lawn in front
of the Med Center asked that charges
related to all persons who were arrested
in connection with the April 9 Medical
Center sit-in and eventual police bust
be dropped.
Gonda noted simply that the charges

were issued by the District Attorney of
Santa Clara County. "The University is
not a party to those cases," Gonda
noted.
Clear Opportunity
"It must be recalled," he stated,
"that those who were arrested were
given a clear opportunity to leave the
corridor before the arrests were made.
When they failed to do so, the matter
passed out of our hands and it is now
entirely in the authority of the District
Attorney."
Provost Miller spoke briefly at the
9:00 rally. He emphasized that Dr.
Gonda "has the responsibility for the
Hospital and he has the authority and
responsibility to deal with those
problems that rest within the
Hospital."
Miller did respond to the fourth
demand—that John L. Wilson resign as
acting Dean of the Medical School.
"Both the President and I strongly

re-affirm our confidence in Dr. Wilson
as Acting Dean and Executive Officer
of the Medical Center," Miller noted.
Toilet Privledges
Gonda, in responding to other
demands, stated that Stanford would
not assume any liability for medical
expenses and injuries to demonstrators
in the April 9 demonstration, and that
in the future rest rooms for employees
would not be classified by jobs and
only by 'male' and 'female' designation.
Gonda agreed, in response to the
seventh demand, that four voting places
on the Administrative Council of the
Hospital be filled by Black and Latin
delegates. "I am of the opinion,"
Gonda stated, "that the advisory input
of a broadly representative group of
employees would be in the best
interests of the Hospital."
He also noted that the Hospital will
accelerate completion and
implementation of a new centralized
job classification system, the substance
of the eleventh demand.
Internal Disunity
There was no immediate response to
Gonda's prepared statement in response
to the eleven demands. At the rally,
James Cheatham of the Black Advisory
Council said he was 'disappointed' in
the University's responses. There
seemed to be some internal disunity
among the hospital workers as to future
action.
Both the Black Advisory Council
and the Alianza Latina held meetings
yesterday afternoon. At both meetings
there was talk of possible job actions
within the Medical Center, but no
formal statement was prepared. The
Alianza Latina will hold a meeting for
Latin workers this morning at 10:00.
