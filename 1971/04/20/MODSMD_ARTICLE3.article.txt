# Observers Say Police Restrained
## 
### BOB DRAZOVICH 
Faculty members who served as
observers of police action to terminate
the sit-in at the Stanford University
Hospital, on Friday evening April 9,
1971, have reported that the police
action they observed in no way
involved excessive use of force.
In a report to the Academic Council,
the ten medical school faculty members
related the incidents which they
observed from approximately 5:30
p.m. until all demonstrators were
dispersed. The observers were issued
green arm bands for identification and
were allowed to witness the
proceedings at close range.
The faculty observers were assigned
to both ends of the administration area
that had been blockaded by the
demonstrators and witnessed the police
action in breaking into the area and
arresting on dispersing to protestors.
Rough Tactics
Dr. James B. D. Mark, Professor of
Surgery and Associate Dean of the
School of Medicine also noted that he
"observed police firmness, but no
unnecessarily rough tactics."
This restraint, he said, was exercised
in the face of verbal abuse from the
demonstrators. Dr. Kenneth L. Vosti,
Associate Professor of Medicine, noted
that the demonstrators "became
verbally abusive and threatening to the
officers."

The observers, as stated by Dr.
Lawrence G. Crowley, Professor of
Surgery, also reported that "The police
were very cooperative in allowing us to
take care of the wounded."
The group of protestors, asking that
Sam Bridges be reinstated on the
hospital staff, had occupied the
administration offices all Thursday
night and Friday morning. The
demonstrators had allowed doctors,
nurses, and patients access to the area.
Decision Made
Faculty members who were to serve
as observers were called to a meeting
with Provost William Miller at the
Medical Center. There they were
informed "that there was going to be a
police eviction of the demonstrators
starting at 6:00 p.m."
Dr. Crowley pointed out that the
faculty observers "were not called in
for any suggestions and that the
decision to use police force . . . had
already been made."
The observers duties were, as Dr.
Robert T. Schimke, professor of
Pharmacology and Biology states, "for
the purpose of determining if any
unusual • or wrongful acts were
performed by any police officers,
demonstrators, et cetera."
At approximately 6:00 p.m., the
occupants of the blockaded area were
asked to disperse, first by the building

"owner" and then by the police. They
were given five minutes to do this.
Dr. Schimke records that "the
response from the other side of the
doors was to the effect that the police
should leave, because otherwise there
was going to be a mess inside, and a lot
of people were going to be hurt."
Missiles Thrown
Dr. Elliot C. Levinthal, Senior
Scientist in the Department of Genetics
and Associate Dean of Research noted
that "Missiles were thrown at the
police" from inside the barricade.
At about 6:30 p.m., the police
broke through the barricade and the
occupants attempted to escape by
opening the other end of the area. This
part, the east side, was also surrounded
by police.
No faculty observers were inside the
blocked area to observe the fighting,
but Dr. Crowley did describe the events
at the east end of the area when "The
demonstrators opened the door and
met the police.
Weapons
"They charged at the police with the
first line of demonstrators carrying
clubs of various sorts. The clubs were
the legs of tables and chairs and each
one I saw bore either a large screw or a
sharp metal flange. They flailed away at
the police with these clubs. I looked at
one of the weapons later and it was

clearly a device capable of producing
serious injury."
The police were unable to detain
many of the chargers, but did capture
about fifteen. Dr. Robert Mason,
Associate professor of Surgery, noted
that "There were approximately 6 or 8
people lying on the floor."
Several Injured
Dr. Crowley noted that "many of
those who were captured sustained
blows to the head and face." One girl
appeared to be more seriously injured
and upon Dr. Mason's request, was
allowed to be removed to the
emergency room.
Several police were also injured in
the confrontation. Dr. Mason
enumerated their injuries as "a broken
finger ... a left forearm contusion, and
a left shoulder injury."
Dr. Crowley noted the actions
interfered with the normal treatment of
patients. Going to check on the injured
girl in the emergency room, Dr.
Crowley found "The scene was chaotic
with two inches of water on the floor.
There were several very sick people (in
the room), including the victims of an
automobile accident."
