# Two Campus Fires
## Vandals Trash Union Store 
### 
Vandalism at the Tresidder Drug
Store and two apparently accidental
fires at the Nitery and Roble shattered
the calm of an otherwise peaceful
campus last night.
The fire on the second floor of the
Nitery next to the Old Union, was
extinguished by a custodian in the
building before fire trucks arrived. It
apparently began within the building,
as observers stated that no object had
been thrown inside. The custodian
turned in the fire alarm at 11:20.
Shortly afterward, a motorcycle fire
was reported next to the storage
lockers behind Koble Hall.
Karlier in the evening, five men
wearing ski masks or caps pulled down
over their faces, aided by a sixth acting

as a lookout, vandalized the Tresidder
drugstore shortly before closing time,
knocking over two counters and several
shelves of merchandise.
No immediate estimate of damage
was available, but the Tresidder night
supervisor indicated that the store
would not open on time this morning
to permit employees to clean up the
mess.
Much of the store resembled a
disaster area after what one eyewitness
described as the "cyclone action" of
the vandals. Smashed bottles of
peanuts, sunglass lenses and bags of
potato chips littered the floor near the
cash register. The left rear area of the
store, where two large counters were
partially overturned, was in a similar

state of disarray.
Stanford police later described the
vandals as six husky black males, but
could offer no further information.
Eyewitnesses said that the five
entered the store in two groups at
approximately 9:55, five minutes
before closing time. They spent a few
moments at the magazine rack at the
rear of the store, and then began their
"four second" sweep to the front of
the store.
The group then charged out of the
store and ran in the direction of
Bowman Alumni House.
Store employees said that they were
occupied in the storage areas of the
shop and did not pay any particular
attention to the five.
