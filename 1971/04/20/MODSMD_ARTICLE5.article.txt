# Brown Gets Five Days For Berkeley Protest
## 
### FRED MANN 
Professor Robert McAfee Brown, his
son Peter, and Associate Dean of
Students William Leland were among
17 people sentenced to five days in jail
yesterday for their parts in a Good
Friday anti-war demonstration in front
of the Berkeley selective service offices.
The protesters, predominantly from
the Berkeley area, all were offered
penalty alternatives of $50 fines or five
days in Santa Rita Prison. All chose the
later. The group was found guilty of
"blocking a public walkway" for their
nonviolent stand in front of the draft
board entrance.
On three earlier occasions, the elder
Brown led groups of clergy, faculty,
and students to the San Mateo draft
center for similar protests. Each time
no complaint was filed, and the local
police ignored the demonstrators.
The April 9th action in Berkeley
however was led predominantly by
students, and police action was swift.
After blocking the doorway for only
half an hour, the 17 were arrested,
charged with the misdemeanor, and
marched down the block to the police
station.
Similar Sentence
The sentences, more or less a
foregone conclusion, were the same
other draft board protesters had
received in similar blockades at offices

in San Francisco, Oakland, and San
Jose.
Peter Brown, (Class of '70), Lqjand,
and two others will begin serving their
sentences on Thursday. The 13 others
including Prof. Brown (Humanities
Special Programs) will enter jail April
30.
"I have no regrets about what I have
done," said Peter Brown last night.
Popular Statement
His father drew applause from
spectators in the courtroom with a
statement he read at the outset of the
proceedings. It said in part:
"... as long as men go through the
doors of draft boards, the manpower
for waging the war (in Southeast Asia)
or similar wars is assured. On Good
Friday/Passover we choose to engage in
a symbolic act of stopping that flow of
human lives heading towards
destruction.
"What we have said for years with
our words, we choose to say this time
with our bodies as well. We tried to say
that as long as we stand here, no man
will be enrolled here to kill or be killed,
no work will be done here to widen the
war, no one will receive orders here
that will make him a potential war
criminal, no action will emanate from
here that will lead to the dropping of
napalm on children, the shooting of
women, or the destruction of villages."
