# Marine Recruiting Raises Big Stink
## 
### 
Seven demonstrators staged a brief
sit-in at the Placement Center yesterday
afternoon in protest of the presence of
a Marine recruiter on campus.
When ordered to leave by Ralph
Keller, director of the Placement
Center, and Officer Charles F. Ford,
campus police, three of the students
left and four remained. The four who
remained included Jim O'Fallon, law
student, Charles Field, and Fred Foyce.
Although warned by Keller that they
were in violation of the University

policy on disruptions, the four
remained from 1 to 2:45 p.m. to
"engage in a dialogue" with the Marine
recruiter.
Earlier in the day, another person
dumped a bottle of foul smelling liquid
on the carpet of the Placement Center.
Apparently the act was also in protest
of the presence of the Marine recruiter.
On April 7, two persons entered the
Placement Center and dumped a bottle
of similar liquid over an Army
recruiter.
