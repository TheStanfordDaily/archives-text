"To: Members of the University
Community
"From: R.W. Lie-man
"Provost William F. Miller,
Associate Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig, and Special Assistant
to the President John J. Schwartz

have been suspended with pay
pending an investigation of
charges that they incited the Palo
Alto police to riot at the Stanford
Medical Center on Friday, April
16. If the charges are
substantiated, 1 shall ask that
these persons be relieved of their
offices and that their services to
the University be terminated.
They may, if they choose, request
a hearing before the University
Advisory Committee, or may
determine a resolution of their

cases in private consultation with
me.
"No social organism as
complex as a modern university
can tolerate administrative
willfulness, incompetence, or
stupidity. No university can
remain open when close-minded
administrators, separated from
principle and reality by a wall of
bureaucratic procedure, act
deliberately to endanger the lives
of members of the community, be
they patients in a hospital or
participants in a labor dispute.
"The University, through its
legal counsel, will be seeking a
Temporary Restraining Order and
Injunction against Messrs. Miller,
Rosenzweig, and Schwartz and
any who may in the future be
determined to have abetted them
in the actions mentioned above.
Affidavits confirming their
behavior on Friday, April 16 are
now being solicited and may be
delivered to the President's office.
"In the meantime, I would
counsel students to stay in their

dormitories, doctors in their
offices, workers on their jobs, and
others in their places. Any
connections made between the
cases of Sam Bridges, Jose
Aguilar, and Bruce Franklin
would only exacerbate the tense
situation on this campus and
should be discouraged by all who
are committed to rational
discourse and procedure in the
Academy."
(Fortunately or unfortunately,
the events described in this
humorous letter are not true.
