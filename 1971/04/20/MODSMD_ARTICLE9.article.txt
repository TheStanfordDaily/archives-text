There are many reasons why a tragic sense of
life does not come easy to Americans, and why a
tragic sense of life is needed if we are not to
destroy ourselves. Until recently it was so easy not
to believe evil of ourselves. Even when we saw the
photographs used as evidence in the Calley trial, it
was easy to be detached from them. They could
not have connection to us.
To begin with, we were a new nation, born on a
new continent, a people eager to forget past
human history.
"I know America," President Nixon is fond of
saying. "And the heart of American is good." For
three and a half centuries we have had to believe
this about ourselves. That belief has been a
necessary pillar in our sense of worth and meaning.
We had to believe that America would be hope.
America would be beautiful. America would be
"new." What would be newest about it would be
the absence of tragedy, the advent of hope.
Optimism became the one necessary foundation of
the republic. Things must always be lookig up.
Ideological Blinders
We see now, after 35 0 years, that such
ideological blinders prevented our ancestors—and
ourselves—from recognizing the true history of our
nation and its true relation to the rest of the
world. Even when our children despair of us, it is
not from despair. It is from too much hope. So
powerful is the American illusion that our children
are absorbed by it, and are full of rage not because
their parents preached illusion, but because their
parents failed to live up to it.
The new world became hopelessly enmeshed in
slavery and its deep psychic corruptions, which
would entangle human relations as tragically as
ever they had been in the "old world." In
aggrandizement, greed, chicanery and
exploitations, the men of the new world showed
daily that the new history was all too like the old.
Enormous advantages of a fresh beginning in a
wealthy and beautiful land were all too quickly
squandered.
The atom bomb was dropped on cities crowded
with men of the yellow race. Tortures,
assassination, murder, and an unparalleled
schorching of the land came to characterize, to an
extent not yet explored, American tactics in a war
full of dilemmas in Vietnam.
The artificality of an economy based on
advertising causes many men and women of

sensitivity muted anguish in their daily work—was
it this that in their youth they had in mind as
"fulfillment." Public duty and private escape
divide the lives of many.
A Tragic Sense
Had Americans a tragic sense, none of this
would be surprising. What is more typical of the
human story than such a denouncement? Had we a
tragic sense, we could perhaps admit military and
political defeats, admit that "the heart of
America" is not particularly good but ambivalent,
admit that our public and private lives are shot
through with falsehood and betrayal.
Nothing is more common and ordinary than
that. It is, rather, the pretense of innate goodness
that so bitterly divides Americans. Since each must
think of himself or herself as good, it becomes
necessary to project evil on others.
Thus middle Americans blame "agitators" and
"communists," radicals blame "pigs" and
"fascists," black militants blame "honkies" and
"imperialists," women's lib blames "men," liberals
blame "ideologists."
Plague In Ourselves
The tragic sense of life suggests that the plague
is not in others but ourselves. It suggests that all
things human, given enough time, go badly. And it
does not find such suggestions reason for shock, or
crippling feelings of guilt, or dismay, or escape
from action. On the contrary, the tragic sense of
life differs from pathos precisely because it views
humans as agents and actors, not as victims.
The tragic sense of life is a calm acceptance of
despair, a firm determination to act well and
unflinchingly, and forgiveness in advance for
others as well as for oneself. No one escapes the
burden of being fully human- even when each well
knows himself to be incompletely human.
Tragedy arises precisely because we are called
upon to act today with a wisdom, courage,
honesty and compassion which we do not as yet
possess. Had our people and our leaders a tragic
sense of life, America would be less self-flagellant«
more at peace with herself, and far less pretentious
among others. Expecting less, we might quietly do
more. Less righteous, we might be more honest
with ourselves and with each other.
