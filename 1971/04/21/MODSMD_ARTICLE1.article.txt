# Aguilar's Case Loaded With Divergent Assumptions
## 
### KIM McCALL News Analysis 
Sharp differences of opinion and divergent
lines of reasoning are finally emerging in the
dispute over denial of tenure to Chicano
neurosurgeon Jose Aguilar.
The issue is becoming much larger than the
release of one man from the Medical School
and is beginning to call into question all the
criteria used to judge professors and the basic
methods of excercising control over thier
careers.
The decision not to rehire (and thus grant
tenure to) Aguilar was made by an eight-man
committee of senior faculty of the Med
School's Department of Surgery.
The main grounds which have been given
for the tenure denial are "lack of clinical
judgement," poor relations with hospital staff,
lack of sufficient quality research, and the
charge that he was not fulfilling his duties as a
faculty surgeon by not serving a sufficient
number of students and patients. Other
grounds include a lack of funding and
changing departmental needs.
In contrast to these types of charges, a
release from the "Chicano Press at Stanford"
says, "Dr. Aguilar's past professional record
and his devotion to the health and welfare of
all people have proved him to be a competent
and useful member in the field of medicine."

"Chicanismo," the official publication of
MECHA, charges that Dr. Hanberry, chief of
neurosurgery, intentionally channeled patients
and students away from Dr. Aguilar. In regard
to the charge of his lack of clinical judgement,
it is argued that, were this charge true, it
would surely have been discovered before he
was appointed to a second term as Assistant
Professor.
As a result, Dr. Aguilar's supporters see his
effective dismissal as much more racially and
politically motivated. But the Med School
says that such charges are completely
unfounded, as several professors are denied
tenure each year by the same process as Dr.
Aguilar. Acting Dean of the Med School John
L. Wilson said the Provost's office has
investigated the case and discovered no
irregularities in the decision-making process.
Progressive Doctor
But there are several other reasons why
Aguilar might have been denied tenure.
According to Gary Cavazos, editor of
"Chicanismo," he is a champion of progressive
change and is involved in preventive medicine,
which is much less lucrative than curative
medicine. He has spent a lot of time recruiting
minority students, working at People's
Medical Center in Redwood City, and
counseling students; and he has questioned

the burgeoning "health industry," Cavazos
said.
He believes that Dr. Hanberry channeled
patients away from Aguilar to "lay the
groundwork" for the denial of tenure.
Speaking of the need to retain Dr. Aguilar,
first year med student Bertha Gonzalez called
him the link of humanity between Stanford
and many students. She said that we need to
keep men here who deal with students to help
develop their characters rather than training
them to work in labs and win Nobel Prizes.
She aiso said, "He's been our friend and
counselor, because he's the only one who will
listen."
Personal Example
Dr. Aguilar is seen by the Chicano
community as a personal example to show the
way to success and inspire hope for
meaningful achievement.
According to Cavazos, Dr. Aguilar has led
the way to more liberal admission of minority
med students all over the West Coast. He said,
"There are only 10 or 12 Chicano doctors in
the U.S., and Aguilar is the only person who
seems to be doing anything about it."
Emphasizing Dr. Aguilar's human value,
Anglo med student Roy Hankins said that the
selection of med students places primary value
on excellence in study and as a result most are
not very concerned with people. "We need a

model of a whole man like Dr. Aguilar who is
concerned with people and is the right man
for our age," he said.
But Dr. Aguilar has requested that he be
evaluated solely on his merits as a
neurosurgeon. Regarding this, Dr. Hanberry
recently stated. "1 do not believe that Dr.
Aguilar is a technically incompetent
neurosurgeon. I think he is a competent one, a
skillful one."
Value Conflict
At this point it becomes obvious that the
entire conflict is one of values rather than of
facts. Dr. Aguilar's supporters and the Med
School are emphasizing two completely
different sets of considerations.
Traditionally, in academics, it has been the
right of a department to decide to whom it
wishes to give tenure and to set up its own
criteria for awarding it.
Apparently the Med School believes an
abundant production of research is the
primary goal toward which a professor should
strive, while the students and the ot-ier
backers of Dr. Aguilar, although asserting his
research competence, consider his teaching
efforts, his social involvement, and his human
contact to be much more important.
Six months ago a petition was circulated in
the Med School in an effort to create a

nontenurable faculty position in which
professors who were especially desirable
because of their teaching ability or other
contributions other than research could serve
for an unlimited length of time. Apparently
no action has been taken.
Structure Questioned
Also called into question is the structure
which makes the decisions. Most of the
committee members who decided Aguilar's
fate have no way of judging his work.
Louis Nogales, Assistant to the President
for Mexican American Affairs, described the
structure as tight and autocratic. The charge
of lack of clinical judgement was arrived at
almost solely upon the opinion of Dr.
Hanbery, Aguilar's immediate superior. It is
questionable whether this much power over a
man's career should be centered in one other
man. Nogales says that a better review process
would initially involve more than one
individual to insure a consideration of a
faculty members various activities from
different perspectives.
So, it v ill bt nearly impossible to reverse
the decision, because to do so now would be
to admit either the fallibility of the system or
the falseness of the assumptions underlying it.
Once a professor has passed that system
and those assumptions, they work in his favor
and it is hard for him to question them.

Personal Example
Dr. Aguilar is seen by the Chicano
community as a personal example to show the
way to success and inspire hope for
meaningful achievement.
According to Cavazos, Dr. Aguilar has led
the way to more liberal admission of minority
med students all over the West Coast. He said,
"There are only 10 or 12 Chicano doctors in
the U.S., and Aguilar is the only person who
seems to be doing anything about it."
Emphasizing Dr. Aguilar's human value,
Anglo med student Roy Hankins said that the
selection of med students places primary value
on excellence in study and as a result most are
not very concerned with people. "We need a

model of a whole man like Dr. Aguilar who is
concerned with people and is the right man
for our age," he said.
But Dr. Aguilar has requested that he be
evaluated solely on his merits as a
neurosurgeon. Regarding this, Dr. Hanberry
recently stated. "1 do not believe that Dr.
Aguilar is a technically incompetent
neurosurgeon. I think he is a competent one, a
skillful one."
Value Conflict
At this point it becomes obvious that the
entire conflict is one of values rather than of
facts. Dr. Aguilar's supporters and the Med
School are emphasizing two completely
different sets of considerations.
Traditionally, in academics, it has been the
right of a department to decide to whom it
wishes to give tenure and to set up its own
criteria for awarding it.
Apparently the Med School believes an
abundant production of research is the
primary goal toward which a professor should
strive, while the students and the ot-ier
backers of Dr. Aguilar, although asserting his
research competence, consider his teaching
efforts, his social involvement, and his human
contact to be much more important.
Six months ago a petition was circulated in
the Med School in an effort to create a

nontenurable faculty position in which
professors who were especially desirable
because of their teaching ability or other
contributions other than research could serve
for an unlimited length of time. Apparently
no action has been taken.
Structure Questioned
Also called into question is the structure
which makes the decisions. Most of the
committee members who decided Aguilar's
fate have no way of judging his work.
Louis Nogales, Assistant to the President
for Mexican American Affairs, described the
structure as tight and autocratic. The charge
of lack of clinical judgement was arrived at
almost solely upon the opinion of Dr.
Hanbery, Aguilar's immediate superior. It is
questionable whether this much power over a
man's career should be centered in one other
man. Nogales says that a better review process
would initially involve more than one
individual to insure a consideration of a
faculty members various activities from
different perspectives.
So, it v ill bt nearly impossible to reverse
the decision, because to do so now would be
to admit either the fallibility of the system or
the falseness of the assumptions underlying it.
Once a professor has passed that system
and those assumptions, they work in his favor
and it is hard for him to question them.
Sharp differences of opinion and divergent
lines of reasoning are finally emerging in the
dispute over denial of tenure to Chicano
neurosurgeon Jose Aguilar.
The issue is becoming much larger than the
release of one man from the Medical School
and is beginning to call into question all the
criteria used to judge professors and the basic
methods of excercising control over thier
careers.
The decision not to rehire (and thus grant
tenure to) Aguilar was made by an eight-man
committee of senior faculty of the Med
School's Department of Surgery.
The main grounds which have been given
for the tenure denial are "lack of clinical
judgement," poor relations with hospital staff,
lack of sufficient quality research, and the
charge that he was not fulfilling his duties as a
faculty surgeon by not serving a sufficient
number of students and patients. Other
grounds include a lack of funding and
changing departmental needs.
In contrast to these types of charges, a
release from the "Chicano Press at Stanford"
says, "Dr. Aguilar's past professional record
and his devotion to the health and welfare of
all people have proved him to be a competent
and useful member in the field of medicine."

"Chicanismo," the official publication of
MECHA, charges that Dr. Hanberry, chief of
neurosurgery, intentionally channeled patients
and students away from Dr. Aguilar. In regard
to the charge of his lack of clinical judgement,
it is argued that, were this charge true, it
would surely have been discovered before he
was appointed to a second term as Assistant
Professor.
As a result, Dr. Aguilar's supporters see his
effective dismissal as much more racially and
politically motivated. But the Med School
says that such charges are completely
unfounded, as several professors are denied
tenure each year by the same process as Dr.
Aguilar. Acting Dean of the Med School John
L. Wilson said the Provost's office has
investigated the case and discovered no
irregularities in the decision-making process.
Progressive Doctor
But there are several other reasons why
Aguilar might have been denied tenure.
According to Gary Cavazos, editor of
"Chicanismo," he is a champion of progressive
change and is involved in preventive medicine,
which is much less lucrative than curative
medicine. He has spent a lot of time recruiting
minority students, working at People's
Medical Center in Redwood City, and
counseling students; and he has questioned

the burgeoning "health industry," Cavazos
said.
He believes that Dr. Hanberry channeled
patients away from Aguilar to "lay the
groundwork" for the denial of tenure.
Speaking of the need to retain Dr. Aguilar,
first year med student Bertha Gonzalez called
him the link of humanity between Stanford
and many students. She said that we need to
keep men here who deal with students to help
develop their characters rather than training
them to work in labs and win Nobel Prizes.
She aiso said, "He's been our friend and
counselor, because he's the only one who will

man. Nogales says that a better review process
would initially involve more than one
individual to insure a consideration of a
faculty members various activities from
different perspectives.
So, it v ill bt nearly impossible to reverse
the decision, because to do so now would be
to admit either the fallibility of the system or
the falseness of the assumptions underlying it.
Once a professor has passed that system
and those assumptions, they work in his favor
and it is hard for him to question them.
Sharp differences of opinion and divergent
lines of reasoning are finally emerging in the
dispute over denial of tenure to Chicano
neurosurgeon Jose Aguilar.
The issue is becoming much larger than the
release of one man from the Medical School
and is beginning to call into question all the
criteria used to judge professors and the basic
methods of excercising control over thier
careers.
The decision not to rehire (and thus grant
tenure to) Aguilar was made by an eight-man
committee of senior faculty of the Med
School's Department of Surgery.
The main grounds which have been given
for the tenure denial are "lack of clinical
judgement," poor relations with hospital staff,
lack of sufficient quality research, and the
charge that he was not fulfilling his duties as a
faculty surgeon by not serving a sufficient
number of students and patients. Other
grounds include a lack of funding and
changing departmental needs.
In contrast to these types of charges, a
release from the "Chicano Press at Stanford"
says, "Dr. Aguilar's past professional record
and his devotion to the health and welfare of
all people have proved him to be a competent
and useful member in the field of medicine."

"Chicanismo," the official publication of
MECHA, charges that Dr. Hanberry, chief of
neurosurgery, intentionally channeled patients
and students away from Dr. Aguilar. In regard
to the charge of his lack of clinical judgement,
it is argued that, were this charge true, it
would surely have been discovered before he
was appointed to a second term as Assistant
Professor.
As a result, Dr. Aguilar's supporters see his
effective dismissal as much more racially and
politically motivated. But the Med School
says that such charges are completely
unfounded, as several professors are denied
tenure each year by the same process as Dr.
Aguilar. Acting Dean of the Med School John
L. Wilson said the Provost's office has
investigated the case and discovered no
irregularities in the decision-making process.
Progressive Doctor
But there are several other reasons why
Aguilar might have been denied tenure.
According to Gary Cavazos, editor of
"Chicanismo," he is a champion of progressive
change and is involved in preventive medicine,
which is much less lucrative than curative
medicine. He has spent a lot of time recruiting
minority students, working at People's
Medical Center in Redwood City, and
counseling students; and he has questioned

the burgeoning "health industry," Cavazos
said.
He believes that Dr. Hanberry channeled
patients away from Aguilar to "lay the
groundwork" for the denial of tenure.
Speaking of the need to retain Dr. Aguilar,
first year med student Bertha Gonzalez called
him the link of humanity between Stanford
and many students. She said that we need to
keep men here who deal with students to help
develop their characters rather than training
them to work in labs and win Nobel Prizes.
She aiso said, "He's been our friend and
counselor, because he's the only one who will
listen."
Personal Example
Dr. Aguilar is seen by the Chicano
community as a personal example to show the
way to success and inspire hope for
meaningful achievement.
According to Cavazos, Dr. Aguilar has led
the way to more liberal admission of minority
med students all over the West Coast. He said,
"There are only 10 or 12 Chicano doctors in
the U.S., and Aguilar is the only person who
seems to be doing anything about it."
Emphasizing Dr. Aguilar's human value,
Anglo med student Roy Hankins said that the
selection of med students places primary value
on excellence in study and as a result most are
not very concerned with people. "We need a

model of a whole man like Dr. Aguilar who is
concerned with people and is the right man
for our age," he said.
But Dr. Aguilar has requested that he be
evaluated solely on his merits as a
neurosurgeon. Regarding this, Dr. Hanberry
recently stated. "1 do not believe that Dr.
Aguilar is a technically incompetent
neurosurgeon. I think he is a competent one, a
skillful one."
Value Conflict
At this point it becomes obvious that the
entire conflict is one of values rather than of
facts. Dr. Aguilar's supporters and the Med
School are emphasizing two completely
different sets of considerations.
Traditionally, in academics, it has been the
right of a department to decide to whom it
wishes to give tenure and to set up its own
criteria for awarding it.
Apparently the Med School believes an
abundant production of research is the
primary goal toward which a professor should
strive, while the students and the ot-ier
backers of Dr. Aguilar, although asserting his
research competence, consider his teaching
efforts, his social involvement, and his human
contact to be much more important.
Six months ago a petition was circulated in
the Med School in an effort to create a

nontenurable faculty position in which
professors who were especially desirable
because of their teaching ability or other
contributions other than research could serve
for an unlimited length of time. Apparently
no action has been taken.
Structure Questioned
Also called into question is the structure
which makes the decisions. Most of the
committee members who decided Aguilar's
fate have no way of judging his work.
Louis Nogales, Assistant to the President
for Mexican American Affairs, described the
structure as tight and autocratic. The charge
of lack of clinical judgement was arrived at
almost solely upon the opinion of Dr.
Hanbery, Aguilar's immediate superior. It is
questionable whether this much power over a
man's career should be centered in one other
man. Nogales says that a better review process
would initially involve more than one
individual to insure a consideration of a
faculty members various activities from
different perspectives.
So, it v ill bt nearly impossible to reverse
the decision, because to do so now would be
to admit either the fallibility of the system or
the falseness of the assumptions underlying it.
