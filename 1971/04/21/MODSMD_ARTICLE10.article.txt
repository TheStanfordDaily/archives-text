# Geophysicist Honored

Dr. Allan V. Cox, professor of
geophysics, was awarded the 1971
Vetleson Prize - often described as
the Nobel Prize of the earth
sciences - at a banquet in New
York last Saturday.
He shared half the prize with
Dr. Richard R. Doell, chief of the
theoretical physics branch of the
U.S. Geological Survey center in
Menlo Park, for their work in
paleomagnetism. The other half
went to Dr. S. Keith Runcron of
the School of Physics of the
University of Newcastle.

The presentation was made by
Nobel laureate Dr. Polykarp
Kusch, Columbia University
provost and vice president for
academic affairs.
Cox and Runcorn have
received numerous honors for
their investigations of reversals in
the earth's magnetic field.
Evidence of such changes has been
found in the "magnetic grain" of
lava-formed rocks which polarized
as they cooled, lending credence
to the theory of "continental
drift."
