# Tennis Beats La Jolla, 8-1
## 
### HALL DAILY 
The high school team in the country came to town
last weekend and learned a few lessons from their
collegiate elders as the Stanford Indians overwhelmed
La Jolla High School, 8-1. The lone loss of the day
for the Tribe came surprisingly at first doubles.
Rick Fisher, who had already suffered through a
three-set win at third singles, teamed with Roscoe
Tanner in a losing effort against La Jolla's premier
pair, Paul Ramirez and Chico Hagey. Hagey and
Ramirez triumphed 6-4, 6-4.

In singles, Tanner defeated Ramirez, 6-1, t>-2,
while Alex Mayer dropped Hagey, 6-3, 6-2. Fisher
had trouble with La Jolla's Steve Mott at third singles
before disposing of him, 4-6, 6-1, 6-2.
In other singles play, Paul Sidone, Gery
Groslimond, and Rick Evans all won with relative
ease over their junior opposition. Juggling the doubles
line-up, Coach Dick Gould teamed Sidone and
Groslimond at the second spot and placed Evans and
MacClaflin at third. Both teams won in extra-game
second-set matches.
