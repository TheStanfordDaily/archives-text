# Laxmen Whip Claremont, Demolish Santa Barbara
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford lacrosse team
returned from a weekend trip to
the Southland with two decisive
victories over Claremont on
Saturday and UC Sa√üta Barbara
on Sunday. The two victories

exemplified Northern California's
increasing dominance in lacrosse.
Claremont was previously the
only undefeated college team in
the Los Angeles area.
In their first game on Saturday,
the Stanford team scored twice in

the first quarter and three times in
the second quarter to take a
commanding 5-0 lead at halftime.
The play of the defense outshined
the offense. The much improved
defensive corps employed a
man-down defense which
effectively shut off Claremont's
umbrella man-up offense.
In the third quarter, the Indian
squad eased the pressure and was
held scoreless. The hosts
reorganized their attack and
tallied three times to put
themselves back into the game.
The Indian attack became fiat as
the players were making bad feeds
and dropping passes. The attack
was further hampered by
numerous slashing and
high-sticking penalties. The
man-advantages gained by
Claremont because of the Card
infractions helped the hosts'
comeback.
However, Stanford fought back
with a strong fourth quarter led
by Chip Love man's goal and
assist, helping the Indians triumph
8-4.
In the third quarter the Cards
exploded for six goals breaking
out of the rut they had run into in
previous games of not scoring in
the third quarter. They continued
their offensive barrage in the
fourth quarter tallying five more
times.
Today, the team plays a
much-improved UC Berkeley, at
Stanford. Game time is 3 p.m.
The two teams will be vying
for the Abercrombie-Fitch Broken
Stick Award which Stanford has
won over the past years.
