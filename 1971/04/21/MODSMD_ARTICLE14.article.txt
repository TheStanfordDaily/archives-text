### CARLA KALLAN 
The charred remains of Black
Panther Fred Bennett were discovered
near a "bomb factory" last January in
the Santa Cruz Mountains, state agents
reported yesterday.
A felony warrant has been issued for
James Edward Johnson, 27, a former
Stanford chemical engineering student,
charging illegal possession of explosives.
Dave Foster of the Bureau of
Criminal Identification identified the
victim, whose body was burned and
bones broken and scattered, from a
wedding ring and two keys found when
searchers sifted through the bone
fragments.

Investigators discovered 149 sticks
of dynamite, nitroglycerin, fuses,
timing devices and dynamite caps in
and around one of two cabins which
was located some 65 yards from where
the remains were found.
The dynamite cache in the Santa
Cruz mountains was found on land
owned by Stuart A. Mcßae of Los
Alton and Robert E. Stege, Jr. of East
Palo Alto. Mcßae is a Stanford alumnus
who was active in anti-war activities at
the university.
Johnson is being sought throughout
the United States and Canada on a
charge of unlawful flight to avoid
prosecution. He disappeared while
awaiting trial on five felony charges in
Santa Clara County, one for assault and

battery on a police officer. He is
wanted for misdemeanors in San
Francisco and San Mateo.
Johnson was arrested in connection
with a Palo Alto riot in November,
1968, and was among those charged
with disrupting a Board of Trustees
meeting in February, 1969. He was
arrested May 13, 1970, with Leonard
M. Siegel, on charges of possession of
explosive components and conspiracy.
The raid on the explosives was
staged after a former Stanford student
provided information on which a
warrant was attained, and drew detailed
maps of the location. Authorities are
also searching for James Carr, 27, a
teaching assistant at UC Santa Cruz.
