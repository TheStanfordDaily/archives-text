Veterans Demonstrate In D. C.
WASHINGTON — Nearly 1,000 fatigue-clad Vietnam
veterans demonstrated inside and outside the halls of
Congress Tuesday in opposition to the war in Southeast
Asia.
After staging a guerrilla theater in which they simulated
search-and-destroy tactics near the Old Senate Office
Building and on the Capitol steps, the group chanted for 10
minutes: "Bring our brothers home, now."
They chanted with clenched fists or plastic toy rifles
held high over their heads.
Several hundred of them jammed into a Senate hearing
room and cheered when Sen. George McGovern, D-S.D.,
and others called for an immediate end to the war.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee had begun
examination of a series of proposals aimed at hastening
troop withdrawal from Southeast Asia.
They gave a standing ovation to McGovern's testimony
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.
McGovem, the only declared presidential candidate for
1972, was cheered when he arrived and when he concluded
his testimony in which he accused all American forces in
Indochina of war crimes.
Cambodian Crisis
SAIGON — Cambodia wrestled with a government crisis
Tuesday while its forces battled to hold the nation's only
highway to the sea and U.S. 852 bombers hammered
enemy troops threatening another important highway to
the north.
Cambodia's political crisis developed with the
resignation of Premier Lon Nol and his Cabinet. Lon Nol,
who had served also as minister of defense in his

government of National Salvation, suffered a stroke in
February, leaving him partially paralyzed.
He has headed the Cambodian government since March
18, 1970, when Prince Norodom Sihanouk was removed
from office.
On the battle front, the results of fighting for the
control on Highway 4, Phnom Penh's sole link to a
deepwater port, still were not known, more than a day
after enemy forces launched an attack against a weary
Cambodian garrison at Pich Nil Pass.
U.S. 852 bombers, flying more than 50 missions
throughout Indochina in the past two days, attacked
enemy positions north of Highway 7 that runs across part
of Cambodia north of Phnom Penh from the South
Vietnamese border.
Fraggings Increase
WASHINGTON — Fragging incidents among U.S. troops in
Vietnam doubled in 1970 over the previous year, the
Pentagon disclosed Tuesday.
The Pentagon released figures on the number of fragging
incidents after Senate Democratic Leader Mike Mansfield
told the Senate about the murder of a young West Point
graduate in his sleep by an enlisted man who tossed a
grenade into an officer's billet.
Fragging is a term describing incidents involving the
hurling of a fragmentation grenade by one American
serviceman against a fellow GI.
The Pentagon confirmed Mansfield's report of 209
fragging incidents in Vietnam last year and said this
compared with 96 in 1969. There are no records for
previous years.
According to the Pentagon, 34 men were killed last year
in fraggings and 39 in 1969.
