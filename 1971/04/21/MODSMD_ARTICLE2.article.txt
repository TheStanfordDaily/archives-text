## Letter Claims Credit For Attack 
### 
A group calling itself "Volunteers of
America" has claimed credit for
firebombing a Stanford Police
Department car parked behind the
police station and for slashing the tires
on a police officer's private car last
week.
"We, the Volunteers of America,
claim the honor of having both fire
bombed the Stanford pig cars (sic)
Wednesday morning, April 14, and the
tire slashing and car painting Tuesday
(sic) morning, April 13," the
three-paragraph letter read.
"We carried out our act in
revolutionary solidarity with our
courageous brothers and sisters who were
brutally attacked by the swine in the
Stanford Hospital last Friday, April 9.
We wish to emphasize here that we
support everything the people there did
and all their subsequent demands.
"We were not about to take the way
the swine attacked and stomped on
them without striking back in some
way. Since we do believe the revolution
will come only through mass action of
the people, we waited until the pigs
struck again (this time at the (Stanford)
Daily office) before we attacked on our
own; the first night was the immediate
reaction, the second the planned
counter attack ..
A Xerox copy of the typewritten
letter, postmarked in Palo Alto Friday
afternoon, was received in the Daily
offices late yesterday. The unstamped,

typewritten enveloped appeared to be
typed on the same machine as the
letter.
Threat To Policemen
The letter also contained a new
threat—but not a time element — on
the lives of policemen:
"These first times were only
warnings of the storm to come — we
only struck at empty cars; the next
time we will deal directly with the
scum that drive them," the letter said.
"We pledge ourselves, in 100%
solidarity with all the revolutionary
peoples of Amerika (sic) and the world,
to the war against the empire,
especially its armed lackeys.
"SIEZE THE TIME. ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE," the letter
concluded.

"Volunteers of America" appears to
be a new group operating on campus.
The letter, which apparently was also
sent to other papers, radio stations and
Venceremos, a Redwood City
revolutionary organization, was the
first communication from the group to
be received by the Daily.
Officers Leonard Screws and
Raymond Welch, who were leaving the
police station at the time of the attack,
claimed that at least one of the
firebombs was thrown at them. Screws
followed one of the two attackers into
Manzanita Park, where he lost track of
the man. The officers described both
assailants as 5'10" white males.
Slashing and Painting
The other references in the letter

were to the slashing of tires on a
patrolman's private car and the painting
of a slogan on a patrol car.
Fire department officials have
disclosed that both small fires on
campus last night were the work of
arsonists.
There were apparently three
separate fires in the Nitery. In one
instance, an inflammable curtain was
doused with a flamable liquid and set
ablaze.
The motorcycle fire behind Roble,
reported within minutes of the Nitery
fire, was also apparently set. The
motorcycle belonged to Larry Horton,
Assistant Dean of Students in charge of
University undergraduate housing.
There have been no arrests in
connection with either incident.

Wednesday morning, April 14, and the
tire slashing and car painting Tuesday
(sic) morning, April 13," the
three-paragraph letter read.
"We carried out our act in
revolutionary solidarity with our
courageous brothers and sisters who were
brutally attacked by the swine in the
Stanford Hospital last Friday, April 9.
We wish to emphasize here that we
support everything the people there did
and all their subsequent demands.
"We were not about to take the way
the swine attacked and stomped on
them without striking back in some
way. Since we do believe the revolution
will come only through mass action of
the people, we waited until the pigs
struck again (this time at the (Stanford)
Daily office) before we attacked on our
own; the first night was the immediate
reaction, the second the planned
counter attack ..
A Xerox copy of the typewritten
letter, postmarked in Palo Alto Friday
afternoon, was received in the Daily
offices late yesterday. The unstamped,

typewritten enveloped appeared to be
typed on the same machine as the
letter.
Threat To Policemen
The letter also contained a new
threat—but not a time element — on
the lives of policemen:
"These first times were only
warnings of the storm to come — we
only struck at empty cars; the next
time we will deal directly with the
scum that drive them," the letter said.
"We pledge ourselves, in 100%
solidarity with all the revolutionary
peoples of Amerika (sic) and the world,
to the war against the empire,
especially its armed lackeys.
"SIEZE THE TIME. ALL POWER
TO THE PEOPLE," the letter
concluded.

"Volunteers of America" appears to
be a new group operating on campus.
The letter, which apparently was also
sent to other papers, radio stations and
Venceremos, a Redwood City
revolutionary organization, was the
first communication from the group to
be received by the Daily.
Officers Leonard Screws and
Raymond Welch, who were leaving the
police station at the time of the attack,
claimed that at least one of the
firebombs was thrown at them. Screws
followed one of the two attackers into
Manzanita Park, where he lost track of
the man. The officers described both
assailants as 5'10" white males.
Slashing and Painting
The other references in the letter

were to the slashing of tires on a
patrolman's private car and the painting
of a slogan on a patrol car.
Fire department officials have
disclosed that both small fires on
campus last night were the work of
arsonists.
There were apparently three
separate fires in the Nitery. In one
instance, an inflammable curtain was
doused with a flamable liquid and set
ablaze.
The motorcycle fire behind Roble,
reported within minutes of the Nitery
fire, was also apparently set. The
motorcycle belonged to Larry Horton,
Assistant Dean of Students in charge of
University undergraduate housing.
There have been no arrests in
connection with either incident.
