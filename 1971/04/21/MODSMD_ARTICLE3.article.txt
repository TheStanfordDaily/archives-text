# Peer Support, Competence Factors In Medical Center Tenure Policy
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL News Analysis 
The recent turmoil concerning the denial of tenure to
neurosurgeon Dr. Jose Aguilar has accentuated the
ignorance of most of the student body concerning the
medical school promotion and tenure system. Although
tenure policies are uniform throughout all university
departments, the distinctive professionalism of the medical
school makes examination of such policies helpful in
understanding Aguilar's case.
According to Dr. Roy Cohn, the head of the surgery
department medical school excellence is determined by
faculty quality. The goals of the School of Medicine and its
sub-divisions are "high quality of its faculty in the fields of
teaching, research, clinical care, and the delivery of health
care systems."
Dr. Cohn outlines the progression of a medical career,
the various positions held by a Stanford doctor and how
decisions are made concerning his advancement in
yesterday's (April 20) edition of the Medical School
student newsletter, "THE GOOSE." After entering medical
school the student usually knows which branch of medicine
he would like to pursue. He orients his internship-residency
program of from three to eight years toward that goal. If
his talents are academic he is likely to be encouraged to
teach in his specialty area while continuing to develop his
expertise.
Most schools start a doctor as an assistant professor for
three years with the possibility of a three year renewal.
During this "trial" period of developing clinical talents and
continuing research the doctor is closely watched by his
peers, his departmental chairman, his division chairman,
and other professors. Evaluation is made on the basis of
clinical skill, publications, research, honor societies, and
speaking engagements.
During this period a doctor may be hired by other
schools who hear of his work, or be advanced prematurely
by his own school. At the end of six years his contract may
expire if he has not built up sufficient peer reputation or if

his work and publications are not considered good. He may
also not be tenured if his direction does not coincide with
his department's goals, no matter how excellent his work.
However, during the six year "trial," the doctor is given
constant feedback from his evaluators.
At this point in a doctor's career the step from assistant
to associate professor may be given with or without tenure,
a five year appointment or an appointment until a project
or grant terminates. In the School of Medicine another
appointment, Clinical Assistant Professor or Clinical
Associate Professor, can be made with all privileges of a
regular appointment except tenure. Physicians in private
practice are given a similar, though unsalaried,
appointment, Assistant Clinical Professor.
If termination of a doctor's appointment is considered
by his division chief, he recommends termination to the
Department Chairman who consults a committee of
department professors. If there is disagreement the
individual is likely to be granted a second three year term.
By the end of the second term the department chairman
may repeat this process and notify the doctor at least a
year before his final appointment date so he may make
other arrangements.
Competence is established by ad hoc committees
generally constituted by the dean from departments related
to the work of the doctor in question. According to Dr.
Cohn's article, "these men are all recognized experts in
their particular fields and are well able to judge the quality
of the work of the particular physician from different
points of view."
It seems that any further review of the tenure issue
concerning Dr. Aguilar will hinge on two points,
professional competance and ability to work with peers. If
charges of professional compatibility will enter the
limelight bringing with it the question of whether faculty in
any department in the university can deny professors
tenure for personal reasons. If professional incompetance is
proven, the matter will be rapidly closed, as rapidly as it
was the first time around.

the various positions held by a Stanford doctor and how
decisions are made concerning his advancement in
yesterday's (April 20) edition of the Medical School
student newsletter, "THE GOOSE." After entering medical
school the student usually knows which branch of medicine
he would like to pursue. He orients his internship-residency
program of from three to eight years toward that goal. If
his talents are academic he is likely to be encouraged to
teach in his specialty area while continuing to develop his
expertise.
Most schools start a doctor as an assistant professor for
three years with the possibility of a three year renewal.
During this "trial" period of developing clinical talents and
continuing research the doctor is closely watched by his
peers, his departmental chairman, his division chairman,
and other professors. Evaluation is made on the basis of
clinical skill, publications, research, honor societies, and
speaking engagements.
During this period a doctor may be hired by other
schools who hear of his work, or be advanced prematurely
by his own school. At the end of six years his contract may
expire if he has not built up sufficient peer reputation or if

his work and publications are not considered good. He may
also not be tenured if his direction does not coincide with
his department's goals, no matter how excellent his work.
However, during the six year "trial," the doctor is given
constant feedback from his evaluators.
At this point in a doctor's career the step from assistant
to associate professor may be given with or without tenure,
a five year appointment or an appointment until a project
or grant terminates. In the School of Medicine another
appointment, Clinical Assistant Professor or Clinical
Associate Professor, can be made with all privileges of a
regular appointment except tenure. Physicians in private
practice are given a similar, though unsalaried,
appointment, Assistant Clinical Professor.
If termination of a doctor's appointment is considered
by his division chief, he recommends termination to the
Department Chairman who consults a committee of
department professors. If there is disagreement the
individual is likely to be granted a second three year term.
By the end of the second term the department chairman
may repeat this process and notify the doctor at least a
year before his final appointment date so he may make
other arrangements.
Competence is established by ad hoc committees
generally constituted by the dean from departments related
to the work of the doctor in question. According to Dr.
Cohn's article, "these men are all recognized experts in
their particular fields and are well able to judge the quality
of the work of the particular physician from different
points of view."
It seems that any further review of the tenure issue
concerning Dr. Aguilar will hinge on two points,
professional competance and ability to work with peers. If
charges of professional compatibility will enter the
limelight bringing with it the question of whether faculty in
any department in the university can deny professors
tenure for personal reasons. If professional incompetance is
proven, the matter will be rapidly closed, as rapidly as it
was the first time around.
The recent turmoil concerning the denial of tenure to
neurosurgeon Dr. Jose Aguilar has accentuated the
ignorance of most of the student body concerning the
medical school promotion and tenure system. Although
tenure policies are uniform throughout all university
departments, the distinctive professionalism of the medical
school makes examination of such policies helpful in
understanding Aguilar's case.
According to Dr. Roy Cohn, the head of the surgery
department medical school excellence is determined by
faculty quality. The goals of the School of Medicine and its
sub-divisions are "high quality of its faculty in the fields of
teaching, research, clinical care, and the delivery of health
care systems."
