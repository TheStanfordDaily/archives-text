# Court Upholds Busing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) — In a sweeping
smash at segregated schools, the
Supreme Court approved unanimously
Tuesday massive busing and limited
racial balancing as proper ways of
assuring black children an integrated
education.
Speaking through Chief Justice
Warren E. Burger, the court said school
officials must use all available tools,
including gerrymandered districts and
sometimes even free transportation, "to
correct, by a balancing of individual
and collective interests, of the
condition that offends the
Constitution."
If the school boards do not act,
Burger said, federal judges should
exercise their powers "to fashion a
remedy that will assure a unitary school

system." Broadly, the Tuesday ruling
ran counter to announced Nixon
administration positions in opposition
to massive busing and in support of the
neighborhood school concept.
Dismissing arguments against busing,
the court said transportation has been
an integral and normal part of the
public education system for years, with
18 million, or 39 percent, of the
nation's public school children
transported by bus in 1969-1970.
"Desegregation plans cannot be
limited to the walk-in school," Burger
said in a ruling that approved an
extensive bus plan and the use of racial
ratios as a guideline in
Charlotte-Mecklenburg County, North
Carolina.
Similarly, he said, federal judges

erred when they did not order school
officials on Mobile County, Alabama,
to consider using buses and to adopt
new attendance zones to bring Negro
children from the predominantly black
eastern sector of the metropolitan area
to schools in the mostly white western
zone.
Undercutting the
neighborhood-school concept, and by
implication striking at the Nixon
administration which endorsed it,
Burger said neighborhood school
zoning is unconstitutional if it does not
accomplish desegregation.
"All things being equal, with no
history of discrimination, it might well
be desirable to assign pupils to schools
nearest their homes," he said.
