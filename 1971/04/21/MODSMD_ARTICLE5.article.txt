# Earth Week Program Urges Action
## 
### TERRIE McDONALD 
Professor Paul Ehrlich will head a
roster of six speakers highlighting
Stanford's participation in the April
18-23 National Earth Week at a
noon-hour program in White Plaza
tomorrow. The presentations are in
conjunction with campus and
community ecology efforts.
"The emphasis this year is on action
in contrast to the 'educational'
orientation of last year's Earth Week,"
noted Stacey Fitzsimmons, Executive
Secretary of the volunteer Conservation
Group and co-founder of the recently
formed Stanford Community for
Responsible Environmental Policies
(SCREP). The conservation
organizations are stressing the recycling
of glass, cans and newspapers with the
reminder that these are continuing
projects.
Local actions related to this week's
particular ecological concerns have
included Conservation Croups urging
tnistees to vote 'no' on the proposed
Livingston and Blayney land use
Policy/Plan and SCREP's negotiation
with the Canteen Company to have
bimetal cans replaced with returnable
glass bottles. SCREP, "an organization
looking at Stanford as a consumer," has
found Canteen willing to cooperate.
Tonight at 7:30 in Tresidder 270

there will be a meeting to discuss the
nature of next year's Ecology House
which will be located in the vacated
DEKE residence. People living in the 50
member co-ed house will operate their
own kitchen and moniter house wastes,
electricity and sewage to better
understand individual and collective
contributions to environmental
destruction and how it might be

minimized.
Friday, April 23, consumer crusader
Ralph Nader will speak at Foothill
College.
Conservation Group offices, located
on the second floor of Tresidder
Memorial Union, are equipped with a
library of information on matters
concerning area ecology and pertinent
book lists.
