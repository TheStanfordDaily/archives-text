# no trust in administration
## Faculty 'Observation' At The Sit-In 
### 
Michael p. goodman, m.d.

I am compelled to reply to some misconceptions portrayed in a
statement made by the so-called faculty observers to the
Administrative office sit-in and the violent aftermath of April 9. I was
present in the area immediately adjacent to the administrative offices
during the entire police action. After the Police and Sheriff's Deputies
"Cleared out" the offices, 1 accompanied a girl, who had been beaten
about the head and neck, down to the emergency room and
performed an initial evaluation and administered emergency care.
1 was then asked by the Surgical Resident in charge of the
Emergency Room whether there were any other injured civilians.
(One other girl who had been beaten had also been sent down.) I
replied to him "probably so" and was sent up to the area by him with
the directive to find out if anyone else was injured and, if so, to bring

them down to the E.R. for medical attention. Unfortunately, despite
that I had on a surgical scrub suit, white coat with name tag, and
showed a hospital I.D. card, I was not allowed to pass beyond, and
was treated roughly by the cordon of Sheriff's Deputies.
I then spoke to Hospital Administrative Assistants and other police
personnel, advising them clearly that I was officially sent up by the
E.R., but was informed that all injured people were being taken care
of by "faculty observers." These people were bandaged and removed
in wagons to North County Jail.
However, I later learned that indeed these people did require
further medical attention, and later had to be taken to Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center for surgical suturing of wounds, mostly scalp
and facial lacerations. In fact, when a physician was finally allowed to
visit the demonstrators in jail at 2:00 a.m., many had still not received
medical attention.
These are unfortunate, but additional evidence for lack of trust and
faith in the administration and many members of the medical
hierarchy by other members of the Stanford University Hospital.
Why were no minority people, no members of the Secretarial,
Janitorial—why no members of the Junior House staff, allowed the
"privileged few" professors for a "green armband" designating an
observer, only to be tacitly refused. This of course is the same thing as
a grievance procedure with only "management" present.
It must be noted that the one person who, by early straight and
honest dialogue could possibly have prevented the necessity for a
sit-in in the first place, "dropped out" when the going got hot. (I refer
to Hospital Administrator Dr. Gonda.) But then, perhaps he is just a
symbol of established Medical Center thinking and Hospital attitude.
Finally 1 must echo the brilliant note made by Paul Williams, a
black medical student. Despite the egotistic impression of a great
number of physicians, a hospital is jointly and equally run by dietary,
nursing, janitorial, secretarial, engineering, aide, research, and medical
(including Resident) staff, and is run for the non-well and potentially
non-well patient. It is only when the administrators and physicians
realize this and are able to meet with their "partners" as equals can
the whole medical Center function in harmony.

E.R., but was informed that all injured people were being taken care
of by "faculty observers." These people were bandaged and removed
in wagons to North County Jail.
However, I later learned that indeed these people did require
further medical attention, and later had to be taken to Santa Clara
Valley Medical Center for surgical suturing of wounds, mostly scalp
and facial lacerations. In fact, when a physician was finally allowed to
visit the demonstrators in jail at 2:00 a.m., many had still not received
medical attention.
These are unfortunate, but additional evidence for lack of trust and
faith in the administration and many members of the medical
hierarchy by other members of the Stanford University Hospital.
Why were no minority people, no members of the Secretarial,
Janitorial—why no members of the Junior House staff, allowed the
"privileged few" professors for a "green armband" designating an
observer, only to be tacitly refused. This of course is the same thing as
a grievance procedure with only "management" present.
It must be noted that the one person who, by early straight and
honest dialogue could possibly have prevented the necessity for a
sit-in in the first place, "dropped out" when the going got hot. (I refer
to Hospital Administrator Dr. Gonda.) But then, perhaps he is just a
symbol of established Medical Center thinking and Hospital attitude.
Finally 1 must echo the brilliant note made by Paul Williams, a
black medical student. Despite the egotistic impression of a great
number of physicians, a hospital is jointly and equally run by dietary,
nursing, janitorial, secretarial, engineering, aide, research, and medical
(including Resident) staff, and is run for the non-well and potentially
non-well patient. It is only when the administrators and physicians
realize this and are able to meet with their "partners" as equals can
the whole medical Center function in harmony.

I am compelled to reply to some misconceptions portrayed in a
statement made by the so-called faculty observers to the
Administrative office sit-in and the violent aftermath of April 9. I was
present in the area immediately adjacent to the administrative offices
during the entire police action. After the Police and Sheriff's Deputies
"Cleared out" the offices, 1 accompanied a girl, who had been beaten
about the head and neck, down to the emergency room and
performed an initial evaluation and administered emergency care.
1 was then asked by the Surgical Resident in charge of the
Emergency Room whether there were any other injured civilians.
(One other girl who had been beaten had also been sent down.) I
replied to him "probably so" and was sent up to the area by him with
the directive to find out if anyone else was injured and, if so, to bring

them down to the E.R. for medical attention. Unfortunately, despite
that I had on a surgical scrub suit, white coat with name tag, and
showed a hospital I.D. card, I was not allowed to pass beyond, and
was treated roughly by the cordon of Sheriff's Deputies.
I then spoke to Hospital Administrative Assistants and other police
personnel, advising them clearly that I was officially sent up by the
E.R., but was informed that all injured people were being taken care
of by "faculty observers." These people were bandaged and removed
in wagons to North County Jail.
However, I later learned that indeed these people did require
