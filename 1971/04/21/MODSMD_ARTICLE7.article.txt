seminar 70
Editor, THE DAILY:
May I correct the Daily
readers' possible misunderstanding
of Monday's article on religion. I
am not aware of tension between
Seminar 70 and the Chapel
Program. My own relationship
with the Rev. David Roper has
always been cordial and, I think,
mutually supportive in all
personal respects. Conservative,
evangelical students (who may or
may not be members of Seminar
70) have expressed dissatisfaction
with my ministry at Stanford and
with University Public Worship,
but I have never taken this as
representing Seminar 70 or
Peninsula Bible Church.
A couple of quotes in the
article were from sermons that I
have preached this academic year,
but if anyone inferred, as one
might, that those statements were
aimed specifically at Seminar 70,
then the article was misleading. I
have never made that group a
target of any public utterance.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The following resolution has
been passed by a majority of the
members of Serra House, Stern
Hall:
We condemn the police raid of
April 9, 1971, on the non-violent
sit-in at the Medical Center
Administration office. We
recommend the censure of those
administration officials
responsible for the calling of the
police.
We also condemn the raid on
the offices of the Daily as a clear
violation of constitutional
freedoms.
We call for amnesty for all
demonstrators involved in the
sit-in and that the University drop
all charges it now holds against
them. We feel that Stanford
University should assume all
financial responsibility for any

medical care needed as a result of
injuries received in the sit-in.
We support the Black United
Front, the Black Advisory
Committee, the Black Liberation
Front, MECHA, Alianza Latina,
AASA, and the BSU in their
struggle to establish a more
equitable working arrangement
between Stanford Management
and employees, in particular those
employees who are members of
minority groups.
We urge, with the Black
Advisory Committee, the rehiring
of Sam Bridges with retroactive
reimbursement from the date of
termination. We also urge the
rehiring of Dr. Aguilar with
tenure.
We strongly urge the
administration of Stanford
University to meet present
grievances of the university
community head on and to make
positive and constructive efforts
toward the resolution of these
grievances.
Serra House is loaning $200 to
Legal Defense towards the bail of
those who were arrested Friday,
April 9. We ask all other living
groups to do the same.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The case of the Medical School
versus Mr. Bridges, and its ensuing
unpleasantness, has been discussed
at great length in the Daily, with
much emphasis on police brutality
and administrative incompetence.
Ostensibly a major objective of
the leaders and participants in the
sit-in was to "eradicate racism at
Stanford." At least, this objective
was professed and I, for one, find
it very commendable. However, I
would like to argue that the
tactics employed could hardly
have been better disigned to
accomplish the reverse of this
objective, and in fact considerable
damage in this regard has been
done.
Speaking as a sometime
employer of workers in a smallish
operation within the University, I
will put the case very bluntly lest

my point be missed. I will not
now be easily persuaded to hire
minority applicants whose
qualifications are marginal if I run
the risk of mob action resulting
from my judgement that the
applicant is unable to perform as
required by his or her job. I think
I can honestly say that prior to
the events of last week I was
(naively as it turns out) prepared
to do so. The University has
officially committed itself to a
policy of job preference for
minority applicants, steps to
implement this policy have been
taken, and persons such as myself
have sought to cooperate.
The sad exploitation of Mr.
Bridges' case makes it almost
impossible for me to give more
than lip service to this University
policy; it is not difficult in a large
and diverse organization to find
paths around policies of this type.
1 am not involved in hiring enough
people to make much difference,
but 1 have reason to believe that
the feelings I express are
widespread. If this is true, the
cause of "racism at Stanford" has
been dealt a severe blow, not by
the administration or the police,
but by the very leaders of the
protest.
I feel I must add the following.
The people who led and
encouraged last weeks'
demonstration are not stupid;
although I am not so sure I can
say the same for some of their
followers. Surely "racism at
Stanford" is not the central issue
here. In my opinion the use of
these circumstances for other
purposes is a most contemptible
type of exploitation of people.
