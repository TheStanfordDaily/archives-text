## Success Of The Tresidder Boycott 
### 
joe hardegree

Those of us who have been
working on the boycott of
Tresidder take exception to Bob
Bacon's "news analysis" printed
in last Friday's Daily. We think his
article shows considerable
ignorance about what is really
going on and it gives a very untrue
picture of the situation.
It is Mr. Bacon's opinion that
the boycott has not been a
success. He bases this not on any
particular economic statistics,
since the Tresidder management
doesn't seem to want to give any
out, but rather on the "tolerant
and amused" attitude exhibited
by that management.
Instead of gullibly swallowing
the statements of Tresidder
management, perhaps Mr. Bacon
should actually look into
Tresidder during the ordinarily
very busy noon hour and see how
relatively few people there are
eating there. Or, he might take
notice of the fact that hundreds
are using the alternate food
service each day. Or, he might
notice the two large
advertisements that Tresidder has
run in his very own Daily telling
us what a great place Tresidder is.
Or, he might notice that the price
of hamburgers has come down.
It is true that neither Tresidder
nor the university has rehired all
12 of the laid-off workers. In that
sense, the boycott "voctory" is
not complete. But there have been
many successes, and very
substantial ones, already.
First of all, contrary to its
usual practice, the Personnel
department has been making a
fairly serious effort to stay in
contact with the 12 laid-off
workers from Tresidder and rehire
them in other University
positions. That, of course, has
been the University's stated policy
for some time. Unfortunately, it is
a policy that is seldom carried
out. In most cases workers who
are laid-off get frustrated after
two or three trips to the Personnel
office and give up on the idea of
getting another job at Stanford.
And few are ever called when new
jobs open up.
Secondly, a brief story in the
very same Daily where it was
proclaimed that we were
"unsuccessful" told us that the
Physical Plant is not going to have
to lay-off the 16-20 workers it
had announced after all. The

Physical Plant director said that
the situation had changed. How
right he is. The change was that
the Tresidder boycott has shown
that workers are not going to take
lay-offs lying down. The Physical
Plant turn-around on lay-offs was
a victory for the boycott.
Thirdly, the boycott has
educated a great many people,
workers and non-workers, on
campus and off, about the issue of
lay-offs and decision-making in
general as it affects workers. The
point has been driven home again
and again: why do the most
vulnerable people in our society,
the most lowly-paid and otherwise
oppressed, have to bear, the major
burden of economic difficulty?
How can faculty members get a 5
percent raise while workers are
laid-off, into a job market that
condemns many of them to
perpetual unemployment?
Fourthly, the boycott has been
a good organizing move for the
groups which have been out front
putting it together and carrying it
on. Workers all over campus have
been made aware that USE
(United Stanford Employees), the
Black Caucus, and Venceremos
Workers, along with other
supporting groups, are serious,
hard-working, and progressive. As
the day comes closer when
Stanford workers will have to
decide which organizations they
want to be a part of and have
represent them as a union, USE in
particular will be remembered for
having taken a strong stand when
their vital interests were at stake.
Beyond the question of
"success," however, some of

Bacon's other comments deserve a
response.
For example, he tells us that
the boycott tries to "reduce the
world to a dichotomy: workers
and third-world people on the one
hand, the imperialistic Stanford
administration on the other."
Right on! I would contend that
this is not a simplistic "reduction"
but, to the contrary, is
an extension of simple issues into a
broader and more comprehensive
framework. We think that the
Tresidder lay-offs are not just a
simple matter of twelve workers
losing their jobs but rather that
they point to deeper and more
significant issues that people are
going to have to begin dealing
with. It is the other side that
wants to make this a simple issue,
with a simplicity that is naive and
distorted.
We are pushing it toward a
larger framework not for the
purpose of confusion but for the
purpose of greater clarity. The
real issue is not merely that
Stanford made a bad decision.
Where did they get the right to
make that decision in the first

place? There are some
fundamental problems of our
whole society that are represented
in the issue of layoffs. And it is
only in solving those problems
that we make any long-term
progress in resolving the issues at
stake. Our sings are not attempts
to reduce human understanding
but to broaden it.
Bacon suggests that the
Alternate Food Service "lives as a
parasite on Tresidder Union." Just
who do the land and buildings
belong to anyway? Do they
belong to the Indians who lived
here before it was ripped off by
the invading white settlers? Or do
they belong to the Chinese who
gave their very lives doing the
work that built the Stanford
fortune? Maybe it belongs to the
people who worked at Tresidder
for years and then were laid-off
with no unemployment insurance
because Stanford didn't see fit to
provide it.
The "profits" for the Alternate
Food Service go to help out some
of the people that Stanford chose
not to help. Already over $400
has been distributed with that

much again in the process of being
given out. This money has gone to
pay house rent, medical bills, etc.,
for people whose labor helped
build and sustain Tresidder and
those people aren't claiming that
we are a parasite.
Fortunately, the workers'
movement does not depend upon
Daily news analyses. The boycott
is successful and it will continue
until all Tresidder workers are
rehired. Union activity will
continue at Stanford until all
workers are represented in a
maximum way, leading to worker
decision-making power over all
matters which affect them.

Boycott Tresidder!

Those of us who have been
working on the boycott of
Tresidder take exception to Bob
Bacon's "news analysis" printed
in last Friday's Daily. We think his
article shows considerable
ignorance about what is really
going on and it gives a very untrue
picture of the situation.
It is Mr. Bacon's opinion that
the boycott has not been a
success. He bases this not on any
particular economic statistics,
since the Tresidder management
doesn't seem to want to give any
out, but rather on the "tolerant
and amused" attitude exhibited
by that management.
Instead of gullibly swallowing
the statements of Tresidder
management, perhaps Mr. Bacon
should actually look into
Tresidder during the ordinarily
very busy noon hour and see how
relatively few people there are
eating there. Or, he might take
notice of the fact that hundreds
are using the alternate food
service each day. Or, he might
notice the two large
advertisements that Tresidder has
run in his very own Daily telling
us what a great place Tresidder is.
Or, he might notice that the price
of hamburgers has come down.
It is true that neither Tresidder
nor the university has rehired all
12 of the laid-off workers. In that
sense, the boycott "voctory" is
not complete. But there have been
many successes, and very
substantial ones, already.
First of all, contrary to its
usual practice, the Personnel
department has been making a
fairly serious effort to stay in
contact with the 12 laid-off
workers from Tresidder and rehire
them in other University
positions. That, of course, has
been the University's stated policy
for some time. Unfortunately, it is
a policy that is seldom carried
out. In most cases workers who
are laid-off get frustrated after
two or three trips to the Personnel
office and give up on the idea of
getting another job at Stanford.
And few are ever called when new
jobs open up.
Secondly, a brief story in the
very same Daily where it was
proclaimed that we were
"unsuccessful" told us that the
Physical Plant is not going to have
to lay-off the 16-20 workers it
had announced after all. The

Physical Plant director said that
the situation had changed. How
right he is. The change was that
the Tresidder boycott has shown
that workers are not going to take
lay-offs lying down. The Physical
Plant turn-around on lay-offs was
a victory for the boycott.
Thirdly, the boycott has
educated a great many people,
workers and non-workers, on
campus and off, about the issue of
lay-offs and decision-making in
general as it affects workers. The
point has been driven home again
and again: why do the most
vulnerable people in our society,
the most lowly-paid and otherwise
oppressed, have to bear, the major
burden of economic difficulty?
How can faculty members get a 5
percent raise while workers are
laid-off, into a job market that
condemns many of them to
perpetual unemployment?
Fourthly, the boycott has been
a good organizing move for the
groups which have been out front
putting it together and carrying it
on. Workers all over campus have
been made aware that USE
(United Stanford Employees), the
Black Caucus, and Venceremos
Workers, along with other
supporting groups, are serious,
hard-working, and progressive. As
the day comes closer when
Stanford workers will have to
decide which organizations they
want to be a part of and have
represent them as a union, USE in
particular will be remembered for
having taken a strong stand when
their vital interests were at stake.
Beyond the question of
"success," however, some of

Bacon's other comments deserve a
response.
For example, he tells us that
the boycott tries to "reduce the
world to a dichotomy: workers
and third-world people on the one
hand, the imperialistic Stanford
administration on the other."
Right on! I would contend that
this is not a simplistic "reduction"
but, to the contrary, is
an extension of simple issues into a
broader and more comprehensive
framework. We think that the
Tresidder lay-offs are not just a
simple matter of twelve workers
losing their jobs but rather that
they point to deeper and more
significant issues that people are
going to have to begin dealing
with. It is the other side that
wants to make this a simple issue,
with a simplicity that is naive and
distorted.
We are pushing it toward a
larger framework not for the
purpose of confusion but for the
purpose of greater clarity. The
real issue is not merely that
Stanford made a bad decision.
Where did they get the right to
make that decision in the first

place? There are some
fundamental problems of our
whole society that are represented
in the issue of layoffs. And it is
only in solving those problems
that we make any long-term
progress in resolving the issues at
stake. Our sings are not attempts
to reduce human understanding
but to broaden it.
Bacon suggests that the
Alternate Food Service "lives as a
parasite on Tresidder Union." Just
who do the land and buildings
belong to anyway? Do they
belong to the Indians who lived
here before it was ripped off by
the invading white settlers? Or do
they belong to the Chinese who
gave their very lives doing the
work that built the Stanford
fortune? Maybe it belongs to the
people who worked at Tresidder
for years and then were laid-off
with no unemployment insurance
because Stanford didn't see fit to
provide it.
The "profits" for the Alternate
Food Service go to help out some
of the people that Stanford chose
not to help. Already over $400
has been distributed with that

much again in the process of being
given out. This money has gone to
pay house rent, medical bills, etc.,
for people whose labor helped
build and sustain Tresidder and
those people aren't claiming that
we are a parasite.
Fortunately, the workers'
movement does not depend upon
Daily news analyses. The boycott

until all Tresidder workers are

belong to the Indians who lived
here before it was ripped off by
the invading white settlers? Or do
they belong to the Chinese who
gave their very lives doing the
work that built the Stanford
fortune? Maybe it belongs to the
people who worked at Tresidder
for years and then were laid-off
with no unemployment insurance
because Stanford didn't see fit to
provide it.
The "profits" for the Alternate
Food Service go to help out some
of the people that Stanford chose
not to help. Already over $400
has been distributed with that

much again in the process of being
given out. This money has gone to
pay house rent, medical bills, etc.,
for people whose labor helped
build and sustain Tresidder and
those people aren't claiming that
we are a parasite.
Fortunately, the workers'
movement does not depend upon
Daily news analyses. The boycott
is successful and it will continue
until all Tresidder workers are
rehired. Union activity will
continue at Stanford until all
workers are represented in a
maximum way, leading to worker
decision-making power over all
matters which affect them.
Boycott Tresidder!

Those of us who have been
working on the boycott of
Tresidder take exception to Bob
Bacon's "news analysis" printed
in last Friday's Daily. We think his
article shows considerable
ignorance about what is really
going on and it gives a very untrue
picture of the situation.
It is Mr. Bacon's opinion that
the boycott has not been a
success. He bases this not on any
particular economic statistics,
since the Tresidder management
doesn't seem to want to give any
out, but rather on the "tolerant
and amused" attitude exhibited
by that management.
Instead of gullibly swallowing
the statements of Tresidder
management, perhaps Mr. Bacon
should actually look into
Tresidder during the ordinarily
very busy noon hour and see how
relatively few people there are
eating there. Or, he might take
notice of the fact that hundreds
are using the alternate food
service each day. Or, he might
notice the two large
advertisements that Tresidder has
run in his very own Daily telling
us what a great place Tresidder is.
Or, he might notice that the price
of hamburgers has come down.
It is true that neither Tresidder
nor the university has rehired all
12 of the laid-off workers. In that
sense, the boycott "voctory" is
not complete. But there have been
many successes, and very
substantial ones, already.
First of all, contrary to its
usual practice, the Personnel
department has been making a
fairly serious effort to stay in
contact with the 12 laid-off
workers from Tresidder and rehire
them in other University
positions. That, of course, has
been the University's stated policy
for some time. Unfortunately, it is
a policy that is seldom carried
out. In most cases workers who
are laid-off get frustrated after
two or three trips to the Personnel
office and give up on the idea of
getting another job at Stanford.
And few are ever called when new
jobs open up.
Secondly, a brief story in the
very same Daily where it was
proclaimed that we were
"unsuccessful" told us that the
Physical Plant is not going to have
to lay-off the 16-20 workers it
had announced after all. The

Physical Plant director said that
the situation had changed. How
right he is. The change was that
the Tresidder boycott has shown
that workers are not going to take
lay-offs lying down. The Physical
Plant turn-around on lay-offs was
a victory for the boycott.
Thirdly, the boycott has
educated a great many people,
workers and non-workers, on
campus and off, about the issue of
lay-offs and decision-making in
general as it affects workers. The
point has been driven home again
and again: why do the most
vulnerable people in our society,
the most lowly-paid and otherwise
oppressed, have to bear, the major
burden of economic difficulty?
How can faculty members get a 5
percent raise while workers are
laid-off, into a job market that
condemns many of them to
perpetual unemployment?
Fourthly, the boycott has been
a good organizing move for the
groups which have been out front
putting it together and carrying it
on. Workers all over campus have
been made aware that USE
(United Stanford Employees), the
Black Caucus, and Venceremos
Workers, along with other
supporting groups, are serious,
hard-working, and progressive. As
the day comes closer when
Stanford workers will have to
decide which organizations they
want to be a part of and have
represent them as a union, USE in
particular will be remembered for
having taken a strong stand when
their vital interests were at stake.
Beyond the question of
"success," however, some of

Bacon's other comments deserve a
response.
For example, he tells us that
the boycott tries to "reduce the
world to a dichotomy: workers
and third-world people on the one
hand, the imperialistic Stanford
administration on the other."
Right on! I would contend that
this is not a simplistic "reduction"
but, to the contrary, is
an extension of simple issues into a
broader and more comprehensive
framework. We think that the
Tresidder lay-offs are not just a
simple matter of twelve workers
losing their jobs but rather that
they point to deeper and more
significant issues that people are
going to have to begin dealing
with. It is the other side that
wants to make this a simple issue,
with a simplicity that is naive and
distorted.
We are pushing it toward a
larger framework not for the
purpose of confusion but for the
purpose of greater clarity. The
real issue is not merely that
Stanford made a bad decision.
Where did they get the right to
make that decision in the first

place? There are some
fundamental problems of our
whole society that are represented
in the issue of layoffs. And it is
only in solving those problems
that we make any long-term
progress in resolving the issues at
stake. Our sings are not attempts
to reduce human understanding
but to broaden it.
Bacon suggests that the
Alternate Food Service "lives as a
parasite on Tresidder Union." Just
who do the land and buildings
belong to anyway? Do they
belong to the Indians who lived
here before it was ripped off by
the invading white settlers? Or do
they belong to the Chinese who
gave their very lives doing the
work that built the Stanford
fortune? Maybe it belongs to the
people who worked at Tresidder
for years and then were laid-off
with no unemployment insurance
because Stanford didn't see fit to
provide it.
