The Palo Alto City Council
refused on Monday to question
police handling of the Good
Friday sit-in at Stanford Hospital,
or their subsequent search for
evidence at the Stanford Daily
offices.
Instead, individual councilmen
praised officers for their
"professionalism." City Manager
George Morgan stated that he
made "no apologies for the action
of the police department. In fact,
I highly commend them."
The council tabled a motion by
Kirke Comstock asking for a staff
report on the unsuccessful search
of the Daily office and for
justification of that search on
constitutional grounds. While
attributing a major share of the
responsibility for the Good Friday
violence to the demonstrators,
Comstock condemned the search
of the Daily, fearing it to be part

of a "campaign against the press."
Other councilmen disagreed
with his views. Ed Arnold read
into the minutes of the meeting a
column by Palo Alto Times editor
Alexander Bodi distinguishing
their photo policy from that of
the Daily "it is far too easy to
home in on the easy issue,
freedom of the press, and lose
sight of the larger issue of violence
at Stanford Hospital."
Councilwoman Frances Dias
accused Comstock of "selectivity"
in his request for account of the
search. "Either you support the
police in maintaining law and
order in this city or you don't."
City Manager Morgan, in an
emotional speech, said the
warrant had been obtained to find
evidence against "felons who
chose to make part of their
mission at the hospital the
injuring or maiming of a police
officer."
