Today In The 'Daily'
Today marks a true watershed in television history. On this {
i day in 1952, viewers across the land were able to tune into the i

y 9 a.m. California time, the show was a bomb. <
. Still, the producers were not deterred, and within thirteen *
► years, they had a long-term series- the Vietnamese war- on a i
► prime-time slot. <
If you have complaints about a bomb you've seen on the i
y tube, direct it to the editorial desk at ext. 4632. i
► If you wish to improve your Neilsen, advertise yourself <
