# Hastorf Relishes Academic Post
## 
### BOB BACON 
Coordinating the varied interests of
some thirty heterogeneous departments
is the challenge facing Albert H.
Hastorf, dean of Stanford's School of
Humanities and Sciences.
The friendly, outgoing social
psychologist combines enthusiasm,
dedication, and a sta f f of skilled
associates to ease the often-difficult
task of handling faculty appointments
and budgetary matters for the school.
His primary concern is with
maintaining "the scholarly life in the
full meaning of that word." To
implement this concern, he works to
maintain strong, cohesive departments
and at the same time, an atmosphere
conducive to innovation and change.
But these generalities do not suffice
in specific situations, and Hastorf must
make difficult decisions on granting
tenure and reappointment to faculty
members, on the appointment of new
faculty and department chairmen, and
on assignment of the always-limited
funds among the departments. Hastorf

sees his role in these matters as a
negotiator between relatively
autonomous departments. "We
represent them, negotiate with them,
argue with them, but we don't sit here
and pronounce decisions," he says. "We
ask them 'What do you want to do that
for?' rather than telling them 'You
can't do that," he explains.
Definition of Quality
Hastorf emphasizes that
appointments and promotions of
faculty members are made on the basis
of a broad definition of quality
including both "scholarly creativity and
teaching effectiveness"; not, as some
critics insist, by "stupidly weighing
reprints." In authorizing new
appointments, Hastorf works to create
a balance within the departments as to
rank, age, and academic specialty. New
blood is a necessity in encouraging
departments to try new academic
ventures, he points out.
Principal responsibility for academic
appointments rests with the
department concerned, but Hastor"

must approve all searches for new
faculty - members, as well as all
appointments and promotions within
the school.
The encouragement of innovations,
in both teaching and research, is an
important part of Hastorf's view of his
role. He cites interdepartmental special
programs such as the new linguistics
venture and the interdisciplinary Ph.D.
plan, as well as some still on the
drawing boards and not yet made
public, as achievements in this area.
Hastorf also has the
often-unpleasant duty of wielding the
financial hatchet for the H&S
departments. He cites as the
outstanding achievement of his first
year as dean, that the reductions of the
first year of the Budget Adjustment
Program (BAP) were accomplished
"without undue tearing asunder of
programs." He views his duties in BAP
as different in degree, but not in kind,
from the regular role of the dean in
budgeting. When more money was
available, departmental requests still
exceeded available funds, and the dean
had to make priority judgments in
much the same way as in BAP.
The dean has high praise for the
three Associate Deans, who share the
duties of overseeing the departmental
activities. Gordon Wright, a historian,
assists Hastorf with the social science
departments; Peter Foulkes, a specialist
in German literature, has primary
responsibility in the humanities; and
physicist Dirk Walecka works with the
natural science faculty.

Each of them spends half time on
his H&S duties and the other half as a
regular member of his department.
They play an important part in the
making of decisions in the Dean's
office; they gather regularly with
Hastorf "to share experiences" and
make plans.
Still Teaching
"We try not to see this office as
bureaucratic," Hastorf says. "We see
ourselves as functioning faculty
members." To that end, he teaches one
course a year, and looks forward to
returning to the full-time faculty after
four or five years as dean. "There
would be an absence of sensitivity if
anyone made this a lifetime job,"
according to the dean.
Hastorf served as chairman of the
Psychology department before
assuming the deanship in April 1970.
His academic specialty is "person
perception." A native New Yorker,
Hastorf holds advanced degrees from
Princeton and was chairman of the
Psychology department at Dartmouth
before coming to Stanford in 1961.
Hastorf finds his crucial post "very
rewarding and a job worth doing. When
I leave this job, I will do so with a sense
of equanimity if 1 feel the quality of
the faculty is higher than before I
became dean. I am here because of my
concern that this institution live out
the scholarly life in the best way
possible." To Albert Hastorf, that is
what being Dean of Humanities and
Sciences is all about.

Each of them spends half time on
his H&S duties and the other half as a
regular member of his department.
They play an important part in the
making of decisions in the Dean's
office; they gather regularly with
Hastorf "to share experiences" and
make plans.
Still Teaching
"We try not to see this office as
bureaucratic," Hastorf says. "We see
ourselves as functioning faculty
members." To that end, he teaches one
course a year, and looks forward to
returning to the full-time faculty after
four or five years as dean. "There
would be an absence of sensitivity if
anyone made this a lifetime job,"
according to the dean.
Hastorf served as chairman of the
Psychology department before
assuming the deanship in April 1970.
His academic specialty is "person
perception." A native New Yorker,
Hastorf holds advanced degrees from
Princeton and was chairman of the
Psychology department at Dartmouth
before coming to Stanford in 1961.
Hastorf finds his crucial post "very
rewarding and a job worth doing. When
I leave this job, I will do so with a sense
of equanimity if 1 feel the quality of
the faculty is higher than before I
became dean. I am here because of my
concern that this institution live out
the scholarly life in the best way
possible." To Albert Hastorf, that is
what being Dean of Humanities and
Sciences is all about.

BUSY ADMINISTRATOR—AIbert Hastorf, Dean of Humanities and Sciences,
strikes a typical pose in his office. He claims to enjoy the "early retirement"
offered by the administrative post. Between coffee breaks, however, he makes
important decisions about academic priorities.
Coordinating the varied interests of
some thirty heterogeneous departments
is the challenge facing Albert H.
Hastorf, dean of Stanford's School of
Humanities and Sciences.
The friendly, outgoing social
psychologist combines enthusiasm,
dedication, and a sta f f of skilled
associates to ease the often-difficult
task of handling faculty appointments
and budgetary matters for the school.
His primary concern is with
maintaining "the scholarly life in the
full meaning of that word." To
implement this concern, he works to
maintain strong, cohesive departments
and at the same time, an atmosphere
conducive to innovation and change.
But these generalities do not suffice
in specific situations, and Hastorf must
make difficult decisions on granting
tenure and reappointment to faculty
members, on the appointment of new
faculty and department chairmen, and
on assignment of the always-limited
funds among the departments. Hastorf

sees his role in these matters as a
negotiator between relatively
autonomous departments. "We
represent them, negotiate with them,
argue with them, but we don't sit here
and pronounce decisions," he says. "We
ask them 'What do you want to do that
for?' rather than telling them 'You
can't do that," he explains.
Definition of Quality
Hastorf emphasizes that
appointments and promotions of
faculty members are made on the basis
of a broad definition of quality
including both "scholarly creativity and
teaching effectiveness"; not, as some
critics insist, by "stupidly weighing
reprints." In authorizing new
appointments, Hastorf works to create
a balance within the departments as to
rank, age, and academic specialty. New
blood is a necessity in encouraging
departments to try new academic
ventures, he points out.
Principal responsibility for academic
appointments rests with the
department concerned, but Hastor"

must approve all searches for new
faculty - members, as well as all
appointments and promotions within
the school.
The encouragement of innovations,
in both teaching and research, is an
important part of Hastorf's view of his
role. He cites interdepartmental special
programs such as the new linguistics
venture and the interdisciplinary Ph.D.
plan, as well as some still on the
drawing boards and not yet made
public, as achievements in this area.
Hastorf also has the
often-unpleasant duty of wielding the
financial hatchet for the H&S
departments. He cites as the
outstanding achievement of his first
year as dean, that the reductions of the
first year of the Budget Adjustment
Program (BAP) were accomplished
"without undue tearing asunder of
programs." He views his duties in BAP
as different in degree, but not in kind,
from the regular role of the dean in
budgeting. When more money was
available, departmental requests still
exceeded available funds, and the dean
had to make priority judgments in
much the same way as in BAP.
The dean has high praise for the
three Associate Deans, who share the
duties of overseeing the departmental
activities. Gordon Wright, a historian,
assists Hastorf with the social science
departments; Peter Foulkes, a specialist
in German literature, has primary
responsibility in the humanities; and
physicist Dirk Walecka works with the
natural science faculty.
