Walkers Raise Funds
Over 700 members of the Stanford-Palo Alto
community participated in last Saturday's Walk for
Mankind and earned $18,000 to $20,000 for the Project
Concern Reconstructive Plastic Surgery Program at
Stanford.
Manning Wins New Post
Bayless Manning, Dean of the Law School, has been
elected President of the Council on Foreign Relations,
announced David Rockefeller, Chairman of the Board, in
New York Tuesday. Mr. Manning will succeed Grayson
Kirk, former President of Columbia University on the
council, which according to Mr. Rockefeller "is looking
forward to an increasingly active and expanded role under
the leadership of its new President."
Veteran Protests War
Clinton Lynch, a World War II Marine Corps veteran
opposed to the Vietnam war and to Stanford's admissions
policies, walked about the campus yesterday afternoon
dressed in battle fatigues, with a camoflage mask over his
head, a noose over his shoulder (for "war criminal" Nixon),
a large silver cross on a chain around his neck, and several
medals pinned to the seat of his pants, including a Purple
Heart, a Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and a
Presidential Unit Citation.
Lynch said that he had applied for admission to
Stanford, but that the University refused to accept his

application without a certified copy of his Honorable
Discharge from the Marine Corps. Lynch spent "four years,
three weeks and one day in a Marine Corps slave camp" in
the South Pacific during the Second World War, and says he
would prefer to have his discharge changed to
"dishonorable" than to submit the Honorable Discharge, of
which he is ashamed.
Lynch says he has written two letters to the Admissions
Office, two to the Daily, and one to English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin, asking for a hearing, but has received no
reply.
