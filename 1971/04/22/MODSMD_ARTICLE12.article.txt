Yesterday's Daily incorrectly stated that a medical
school assistant professor could be promoted to
associate professor without tenure. It also explained
as fact the posts of Clinical Assistant Professor or
Clinical Associate Professor, which would be a regular
appointment with all privileges except tenure. The
clinical professor appointments are under
consideration and have not been approved. The
proposal for these positions was considered at one
recent Faculty Senate meeting and referred back to
the Steering Committee of that body for referral to
the proper committee.
Currently, the title associate professor
automatically carries tenure. Also, any professor who
holds the rank of assistant professor for over six
is automatically granted tenure.
