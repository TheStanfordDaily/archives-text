Vets Defy Order
WASHINGTON — A group of Vietnam veterans voted
Wednesday night to violate a Supreme Court order and
continue their campout on the Mall as part of an anti-war
protest.
Three hours after the Justice Department deadline for
clearing the Mall had passed, authorities had made no
attempt to move the battle-dressed protesters.
Spokesmen for the group said the veterans, if faced with
arrest, would submit peaceably and "march off as prisoners
of war."
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger upheld Tuesday a
lower-court injunction against camping or demonstrating
on the Mall, the grassy area between the Capitol and the
Lincoln Memorial. The Supreme Court upheld Burger's
ruling Wednesday.
Abortion Law Upheld
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court approved
Wednesday prosecution of physicians who perform
abortions, but said pregnancies can be ended legally for
mental-health reasons.
The 5-2 ruling upheld the 1901 abortion law for the
District of Columbia against claims that its wording is so
vague doctors do not know which operations are
permissible and which are not.
But by authorizing abortions to protect the expectant
mother's mental health and by putting the burden on

prosecutors to prove an operation is illegal, the justices gave
physicians considerable leeway.
Not settled yet is whether women have an inherent
private right to obtain an abortion simply because they
desire to end their pregnancy. This issue is pending before
the court in abortion cases from a half-dozen states.
The District of Columbia law, written by Congress for
the capital prohibits abortions except when "necessary for
protection of the mother's life or health." And it stipulates
they must be performed by a licensed physician.
Court Limits C0 9 s
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court said Wednesday,
that men who claim they became conscientious objectors
after receiving their draft notices are not entitled to re
consideration by their draft boards.
However, the 6-3 decision said they cannot be sent into
combat until military authorities make a judgment on their
claims.
