# Negotiators Ready
## Hospital Meeting Set 
### 
Stanford Medical Center officials
will enter into negotiations today with
Black and Latin Hospital employees on
the subject of the composition of
negotiating teams in future discussions
and "as many other agenda items as
possible."
The scheduled meeting between
Black and Latin Hospital workers and
Stanford University Hospital officials
to further clarify and discuss the
Hospital's Monday morning response to
the eleven minority demands was
postponed yesterday morning when the
administration and employees could
not reach an agreement on the
participants in the discussions.
Apparently some of the minority
spokesmen insisted on the presence of
individuals other than Hospital
workers.
Dr. Thomas A. Gonda, Director of
the Stanford University Hospital, stated

yesterday "We have asked for an
opportunity to clarify the composition
of the groups that will take part in the
discussions."
Acting Dean Dr. John L. Wilson of
the School of Medicine said: "We have
proposed that talks take place between
administration and employees,
accompanied by their legal advisors,
and we hope to be able at the earliest
possible time to cam- on the
discussions which began Tuesday in
which many questions were clarified."
Stanford University Hospital
functions were reported normal
Wednesday morning after an expected
"sick-in" to press worker demands
failed to materialize in any substantial
way.
A Hospital spokesman said that
there was no evidence Wednesday of an
attempted slowdown by the workers or
any great incidence of sick-calls.
The emphasis seems to be on the
closed meetings between administrators
and the Black and Latin workers
coalition, who in at least one of their
eleven demands, asked for a greater
share in the Hospital's decision-making
process.
Tuesday morning about 30 Black
and Chicano pickets— mostly
Venceremos supporters--ringed l.h<
Hospital in an informational Sin
connected with the eleven demands.
There were no reported incidents
Tuesday and the pickets left before
10:00 a.m. A noon rally did not
materialize.
An undetermined number of
hospital employees called in 'sick'
Tuesday and didn't show up for work
in an attempted work slowdown that
did not gather momentum Wednesday.
A Hospital news service release
noted that "the University has agreed
in principle to more than half of the
items—six of eleven demands that deal
with minority programs."
The University has, however,
rejected the demands for granting
amnesty to arrested demonstrators in
the April 9 Hospital occupation,
resignations of the Medical School's
acting dean, the firing of two hospital
administrators, and the granting of
tenure to Chicano neurosurgeon Dr.
Jose Aguilar.

The emphasis seems to be on the
closed meetings between administrators
and the Black and Latin workers
coalition, who in at least one of their
eleven demands, asked for a greater
share in the Hospital's decision-making
process.
Tuesday morning about 30 Black
and Chicano pickets— mostly
Venceremos supporters--ringed l.h<
Hospital in an informational Sin
connected with the eleven demands.
There were no reported incidents
Tuesday and the pickets left before
10:00 a.m. A noon rally did not
materialize.
An undetermined number of
hospital employees called in 'sick'
Tuesday and didn't show up for work
in an attempted work slowdown that
did not gather momentum Wednesday.
A Hospital news service release
noted that "the University has agreed
in principle to more than half of the
items—six of eleven demands that deal
with minority programs."
The University has, however,
rejected the demands for granting
amnesty to arrested demonstrators in
the April 9 Hospital occupation,
resignations of the Medical School's
acting dean, the firing of two hospital
administrators, and the granting of
tenure to Chicano neurosurgeon Dr.
Jose Aguilar.
