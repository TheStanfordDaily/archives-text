# Vandals Hit Politicos
## 
### CHARLES FIELD, Jr 
The pattern of Stanford vandalism
in recent months has shifted to include
attacks on specific individuals as well as
general campus damage. Vandalism has
recently struck at outgoing ASSU
Presidents and other politically
involved figures on campus.
Former President Rob Grant, who
sustained three slashed tires and ripped
upholstery damage to his car last
Sunday night, commented, "I can't
dismiss the idea that it's politics."
Council member Pat C. Shea believes
his car, rolled into another last quarter
causing $200 damage, was "singled
out" in a politically motivated attack.
He noted that it had been earlier hit by
eggs, its tires deflated, and the antenna
bent. Hal Michelson, untouched by
vandalism since early winter quarter,
says damage to associate ('.rant's car
seems "unquestionably" political.
Michelson's radiator hose was cut. The
fourth President, Adam Levin, could
not be reached for comment.
Law School Student Association
President-elect, Ed Hayes, whose car
was destroyed by arson in the Roble
parking lot April 16th, said: "There's
some reason to believe political
motivations are involved." Hayes, part
of the Med School 22's legal defense,
noted that two defendants and another
person connected with legal defense
have recently received threatening
phone calls.
Roble Director Larry Horton, whose
motorcycle was incinerated in the
oble lot Monday night, refused to

speculate, saying: "We live in a
troubled society. It's unwise for people
to jump to conclusions."
Roble has been beset this year by a
complex of tensions. Firemen have
been summoned there on 21 occasions,
two bomb threats have been received
this quarter, and over $1,000 dollars
damage in vandalism has accumulated
since September. Roble residents
contacted by the Daily refused any
speculation on the Horton incident,
saying they did not wish to exacerbate
latent dormitory tensions.
Captain Wulschlager of the campus
police declined any statement about
recent campus damage, referring the
Daily to police reports filed with the
University News Service. Jeff Littleboy
of the News Service said recent reports
did not indicate a steady escalation of
vandalism. Rather, he said, vandalism
tends to fluctuate around a given
campus controversy.
A partial list of recent incidents
includes: slashed upholstery, punctured
tires, and top and window damage to
cars; broken windows in both
University buildings and private homes;
and sporadic outbursts of paint
defacement in the central campus.
Recent damage estimates to
University property totaling in excess
of $25,000 break down to: $15,000 to
libraries, $5,000 to Tresidder Union,
and $5,000 to windows, especially in
the Hoover annex. The figure does not
include damage to wall paintings
totalling in the low thousands, or petty
vandalism.

recently struck at outgoing ASSU
Presidents and other politically
involved figures on campus.
Former President Rob Grant, who
sustained three slashed tires and ripped
upholstery damage to his car last
Sunday night, commented, "I can't
dismiss the idea that it's politics."
Council member Pat C. Shea believes
his car, rolled into another last quarter
causing $200 damage, was "singled
out" in a politically motivated attack.
He noted that it had been earlier hit by
eggs, its tires deflated, and the antenna
bent. Hal Michelson, untouched by
vandalism since early winter quarter,
says damage to associate ('.rant's car
seems "unquestionably" political.
Michelson's radiator hose was cut. The
fourth President, Adam Levin, could
not be reached for comment.
Law School Student Association
President-elect, Ed Hayes, whose car
was destroyed by arson in the Roble
parking lot April 16th, said: "There's
some reason to believe political
motivations are involved." Hayes, part
of the Med School 22's legal defense,
noted that two defendants and another
person connected with legal defense
have recently received threatening
phone calls.
Roble Director Larry Horton, whose
motorcycle was incinerated in the
oble lot Monday night, refused to

speculate, saying: "We live in a
troubled society. It's unwise for people
to jump to conclusions."
Roble has been beset this year by a
complex of tensions. Firemen have
been summoned there on 21 occasions,
two bomb threats have been received
this quarter, and over $1,000 dollars
damage in vandalism has accumulated
since September. Roble residents
contacted by the Daily refused any
speculation on the Horton incident,
saying they did not wish to exacerbate
latent dormitory tensions.
Captain Wulschlager of the campus
police declined any statement about
recent campus damage, referring the
Daily to police reports filed with the
University News Service. Jeff Littleboy
of the News Service said recent reports
did not indicate a steady escalation of
vandalism. Rather, he said, vandalism
tends to fluctuate around a given
campus controversy.
A partial list of recent incidents
includes: slashed upholstery, punctured
tires, and top and window damage to
cars; broken windows in both
University buildings and private homes;
and sporadic outbursts of paint
defacement in the central campus.
Recent damage estimates to
University property totaling in excess
of $25,000 break down to: $15,000 to
libraries, $5,000 to Tresidder Union,
and $5,000 to windows, especially in
the Hoover annex. The figure does not
include damage to wall paintings
totalling in the low thousands, or petty
vandalism.

The pattern of Stanford vandalism
in recent months has shifted to include
attacks on specific individuals as well as
general campus damage. Vandalism has
recently struck at outgoing ASSU
Presidents and other politically
involved figures on campus.
