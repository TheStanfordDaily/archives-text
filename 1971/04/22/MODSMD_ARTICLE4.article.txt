jammed the halls of the North County Courthouse this
morning for the hearings. Judge J. Barton Phelps arrived
thirty minutes late due to "procedural problems" and made
two major concessions to defense attorneys Norton Tooby,
Ron Romaines, and Jack Weinberger, members of a Palo
Alto law commune. The defendants, split into three groups
of six persons each, were allowed a later date to enter pleas.
In addition, bail conditions which had barred them from
entering Stanford were allowed to elapse without renewal.
Each of the defendants was handed a legal complaint
after stating his name of record. There were no incidents
during the half-hour of formalities. A total of nine
misdemenors were filed by the Palo Alto district attorney
against each defendant.
Felony Charges
The six defendants who remain charged with felonious
assault upon police officers are Anthony C. Chatmon, a
staff member from Redwood City; John Alan Kay, of Palo
Alto; Irwin H. Lavenberg, of Redwood City; Willie L.
Newberry, chairman of the Stanford Black Students Union;

Steve Henry, of Redwood City; and Jean B. Dolly, a Palo
Altan active in the Midpeninsula Free University.

Philip Samuel Lind, Stanford junior; Edward P. Mangones,
Redwood City; Barbara L. Mooney, Palo Alto; Devera Eve
Satisky, Los Altos, California.
The 9 misdemeanor violations of the California Penal
Code charged willful and unlawful acts which were
committed at the Medical Center. These charges include the
following: interfering, obstructing injuring lawful business
and trespassing; refusing to leave upon being requested to
by a peace officer and owner; remaining present and
participating at the place of a riot, rout, and unlawful
assembly; resisting, delaying and obstructing a public
officer in the discharge of the duties of his office; malicious
disturbing the peace and quiet of the neighborhood of the
Hospital and Medical Center; and maliciously injuring and
destroying personal property not their (the defendants')
own.
According to attorney Romaines, "Due to the serious
nature of the charges, the 'Med Center 22' intend to
proceed with a vigorous defense. We intend to keep the
demand of amnesty as our major strategy." Plea hearings
have been scheduled May 5, 6, and 7 at the same time and
location.
Felony charges against 12 of the 18 adults arrested at
the Medical Center sit-in were dropped yesterday at their
arrignment in Superior Court.
All 18 still face a myriad of charges ranging from
disturbing the peace by tumultuous and offensive conduct
to assaulting police officers in the performance of their
duties.
