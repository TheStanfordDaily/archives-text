# East Pakistan Suffers Brutal War
## 
### BILL CLASTER 
News Analysis
Officially, the conflict now occuring between Kast
and West Pakistan is called a civil war. However, it is
very difficult not to think of it as simply a war
between two separate and very different countries.
Kast Pakistan's 78 million short, dark-skinned
inhabitants refer to themselves as Bengalis, while West
Pakistan's 58 million people, taller and
lighter-skinned, call themselves Punjabis. The two
Pakistan sections pre separetcd by 1000 miles of
Indian territory, and while the Easterners seem to be
people belonging to the Southeast Asian world, the
Westerners identify with the Islamic peoples who
inhabit the land that goes all the way to Turkey.
Although the actual fighting has been going on for
three weeks, the war had been brewing for some time.
Four months ago, Pakastinian President Yahya Khan
called for the election of a constituent assembly in
order to put an end to twelve years of martial law.
Trying to be as fair as possible, Khan gave a majority
of the seats to the heavily populated Kastern sector of
the country. To almost everyone's surprise, Sheik
Mujibur Rahman's Awami League won 167 of the
area's 169 seats • and a clear majority in the
combined nation's 313 seat assembly. Mujib, a
political leader in Kast Pakistan, campaigned on a
platform of autonomy for the Kast, and was
determined to get it.

Yahya, however, thought differently and refused
Mujib's demands for autonomy and removal of all
troops from the Kast. Mujib's response was a call for
an end to martial law. Within a week the Bengalis had
invaded East Pakistan and had captured Mujih.
Due to censorship and general disorganization,
news about the fighting has come out of Kast
Pakistan very slowly. Yet despite numerous West
Pakistani press reports which claim that "conditions
in East Pakistan are returning to normal," this is not
the case. Rather what seems to be occuring is a
combination of the lied Chinese purge of 1966 and
daily My Lai-type massacres.
The 80,000 Punjabis who now occupy Kast
Pakistan have, according to various reports, killed
anywhere from 20,000 to 300,000 Bengalis. The West
Pakistani troops have been especially vicious
regarding the Kast's intellectual leaders. They have
killed students, professors, doctors and engineers in
an attempt to purge the Bengalis of po enlial
leadership.
One American refugee witnessed five professors al
Dacca University lined up against a wall and sho'. I'he
New York Times points out that, "There are usitall;.
two sides to every story . . . But it is difficult lo
imagine some justification for the army's action
This type of mass murder characterizes the Punjabi
bid lo extend its control as far as possible before the
monsoon rains start in a few weeks. Having met little
resistance, from the virtually defenseless Bengalis, the

Westerners have managed to gain control over the
major Kast Pakistani cities.
Yet, control of the entire country seems to be out
of the question. The 78 million Easterners are
crowded into 55,000 square miles, and sheer
manpower alone may he enough to hold off the
80,000 Punjabis. Moreover, because West Pakistan
must send supplies and troops 1000 miles to get i<>
the East, it will be difficult to step up the pace.
India, which is clearly pro Bengali, has restrain! !
itself from extending military aid to the Ka>'
Pakistanis.
The prospects for a quick end to this brutal "eivi
war" are dim. The Bengalis haven't shown any signs ot
giving in, and are, in fact, building a "liberation
army" which has already mounted surprising
resistance. The Bengalis, nevertheless, do not have the
necessary weapons to win the war by themselves, and
unless India is willing to risk a war with China, will
not get them.
The Punjabis are hindered by the distance between
Kast and West Pakistan, and will shortly lose their
advantage with the coming of the monsoon season.
Thus, a long drawn out war is a very real
possibility, as it is not likely that either the Bengalis
will surrender or that the Punjabis will be completely
victorious. Whether this possibility occurs or not,
Kast Pakistan has already been hit by its second
disaster in six months. The question only remains,
how long will this tidal wave last?

Kast Pakistan has already been hit by its second
disaster in six months. The question only remains,
how long will this tidal wave last?

News Analysis
Officially, the conflict now occuring between Kast
and West Pakistan is called a civil war. However, it is
very difficult not to think of it as simply a war
between two separate and very different countries.
Kast Pakistan's 78 million short, dark-skinned
inhabitants refer to themselves as Bengalis, while West
Pakistan's 58 million people, taller and
lighter-skinned, call themselves Punjabis. The two
Pakistan sections pre separetcd by 1000 miles of
Indian territory, and while the Easterners seem to be
people belonging to the Southeast Asian world, the
Westerners identify with the Islamic peoples who
inhabit the land that goes all the way to Turkey.
Although the actual fighting has been going on for
three weeks, the war had been brewing for some time.
Four months ago, Pakastinian President Yahya Khan
called for the election of a constituent assembly in
order to put an end to twelve years of martial law.
Trying to be as fair as possible, Khan gave a majority
of the seats to the heavily populated Kastern sector of
the country. To almost everyone's surprise, Sheik
Mujibur Rahman's Awami League won 167 of the
area's 169 seats • and a clear majority in the
combined nation's 313 seat assembly. Mujib, a
political leader in Kast Pakistan, campaigned on a
platform of autonomy for the Kast, and was
determined to get it.

Yahya, however, thought differently and refused
Mujib's demands for autonomy and removal of all
troops from the Kast. Mujib's response was a call for
an end to martial law. Within a week the Bengalis had
invaded East Pakistan and had captured Mujih.
Due to censorship and general disorganization,
news about the fighting has come out of Kast
Pakistan very slowly. Yet despite numerous West
Pakistani press reports which claim that "conditions
in East Pakistan are returning to normal," this is not
the case. Rather what seems to be occuring is a
combination of the lied Chinese purge of 1966 and
daily My Lai-type massacres.
The 80,000 Punjabis who now occupy Kast
Pakistan have, according to various reports, killed
anywhere from 20,000 to 300,000 Bengalis. The West
Pakistani troops have been especially vicious
regarding the Kast's intellectual leaders. They have
killed students, professors, doctors and engineers in
an attempt to purge the Bengalis of po enlial
leadership.
One American refugee witnessed five professors al
Dacca University lined up against a wall and sho'. I'he
New York Times points out that, "There are usitall;.
two sides to every story . . . But it is difficult lo
imagine some justification for the army's action
This type of mass murder characterizes the Punjabi
bid lo extend its control as far as possible before the
monsoon rains start in a few weeks. Having met little
resistance, from the virtually defenseless Bengalis, the

Westerners have managed to gain control over the
major Kast Pakistani cities.
Yet, control of the entire country seems to be out
of the question. The 78 million Easterners are
crowded into 55,000 square miles, and sheer
manpower alone may he enough to hold off the
80,000 Punjabis. Moreover, because West Pakistan
must send supplies and troops 1000 miles to get i<>
the East, it will be difficult to step up the pace.
India, which is clearly pro Bengali, has restrain! !
itself from extending military aid to the Ka>'
Pakistanis.
The prospects for a quick end to this brutal "eivi
war" are dim. The Bengalis haven't shown any signs ot
giving in, and are, in fact, building a "liberation
army" which has already mounted surprising
resistance. The Bengalis, nevertheless, do not have the
necessary weapons to win the war by themselves, and
unless India is willing to risk a war with China, will
not get them.
The Punjabis are hindered by the distance between
Kast and West Pakistan, and will shortly lose their
advantage with the coming of the monsoon season.
Thus, a long drawn out war is a very real
possibility, as it is not likely that either the Bengalis
will surrender or that the Punjabis will be completely
victorious. Whether this possibility occurs or not,
Kast Pakistan has already been hit by its second
disaster in six months. The question only remains,
how long will this tidal wave last?
