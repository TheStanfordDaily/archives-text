# women and the war
## March On San Francisco 
### 
The war on Southeast Asia has
been going on for years. Every
day the newspapers carry stories
of our soldiers fighting in
Southeast Asia. The effect of this
war on the soldiers has been made
clear. They are maimed and killed.
The effect on Wall Street is
equally clear. The ups and downs
of the stock market are recorded
with much efficiency in the press.
And the effects of the war on the
Third World Peoples within the
U.S. are now becoming clear.
There is one section of the
population from which little has
been heard on this issue.
First, women have been used in
one primary justification for
United States' involvement in
South Vietnam; that is,
underlying all the talk about
'halting the spread of
communism,' 'defending freedom
and democracy' and 'protecting
our way of life,' there is a basic
assumption, sometimes stated but
more often left unsaid. This is the
assumption that innocent civilians
in Southeast Asia, and in the
United States itself, are under
the immediate threat of attack if
communism is not stopped, and
therefore "helpless" women and
children must be protected from
this overwhelming threat to their
security.
Army Exploitation
The fallacious nature of this
assertion becomes obvious when
the treatment of Asian women by
American soldiers is revealed. The
'helpless' women of Southeast
Asia are not only not protected
by the troops, but are subjected
to every kind of degradation and
exploitation by the same soldiers
that are supposed to be there to
maintain their safety from the
'enemy.'
Asian women are the object of
continual joking by drill
instructors, for example, and are
consistently portrayed as dolls,
toys, or playthings. An Asian
American brother describes how
"the instructor would talk about
how Asian women's vaginas
weren't like white women's, but
rather they were slanted, like their
eyes." This sort of
dehumanization fits in well with
the entire racist attitude of the
American military which must
convince the men who are doing
its dirty work that "people with
slanted eyes" are less than human
and that the death of a "gook" is
of no consequence.
Asian women do not suffer

alone from the presence of U.S.
troops in their countries.
American women too feel the
brunt of the war in an increasing
number of ways. The most
apparent effect of the war on
American women is in the
economic sphere. The war-caused
recession has resulted in countless
numbers of women being laid off
from jobs that, in the first place,
paid less than a man would have
made in the same occupation.
Economic Troubles
The concurrent manifestation
of the inflation, higher prices, has
proven disastrous to women who
are heads of families and are the
sole providers for their children.
Food prices have risen at
unprecedented rates, as have the
prices of all necessities. Taxes
have risen proportionate to the
need of the government for
billions of dollars each year to
finance the war effort. Working
women, already overburdened
financially and underpaid, cannot
pay lawyers to find tax loopholes
to avoid paying large percentages
of their taxes, as corporations do.
They pay.
It is in the interest of women
in this country to demand that
the billions of dollars worth of
resources being used to massacre
people in Vietnam, Laos and
Cambodia be used to meet our
needs as women for equality in
job opportunities and pay,
24-hour child care centers, open
admissions in education, and
adequate health care.
Distorted Priorities
A nation enmeshed and
engulfed in a war as senseless and
brutal as the war in Southeast
Asia has its priorities distorted
and twisted. This cannot help but
effect the lives of every American,
including women, whether we
choose it to be so or not. Women,
for instance, are told the lie that
we cannot obtain abortions
because to have an abortion is to
"murder" a potential human
being. While it expresses this
incorrect and misdirected
concern, the government is
responsible for the daily slaughter
of thousands of Southeast Asian
people, including pregnant
women.
A society whose orientation is
toward war and death, whose
every aspect is suffused with the
neccesity of meeting the needs of
the warmakers for gain and profit
is not a society that can meet

women united for april 24

human needs. And women
particularly suffer from this
because we have been denied for
so long the realization of our
potential as human beings. Our
needs can only be considered
seriously when our national
resources, both human and
material, are no longer being
squandered in Southeast Asia.
Join the March
Seventy-eight percent of all
women oppose the war. In our
separate work places and in our
homes we are silent statistics, and
yet we are 53 percent of the
population. By marching together
in a women's contingent on April
24th, we will make our opposition
visible and strong. Join us.
(The Women United for April
24 is a group of Bay Area women
who have organized a women's
contingent in Saturday's march.)
