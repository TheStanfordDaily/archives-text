## We Are All Guilty 
### 
There has been much talk in
recent weeks of the relative guilt
or innocence of Lt. William
Galley. Some question whether it
is correct and fair to prosecute
him without also prosecuting the
highest ranks in the military and
civilian commands, who have
planned, ordered and are
ultimately responsible for
American crimes of war in
Indochina.
But if our government is guilty
of war crimes, the burden of guilt
ultimately settles on all of us as
well. Just as a government is
responsible for the conduct of its
armies in the field and its air force
above, so is a people responsible
for the policies and actions of its
government.
Consider the following
principles from the Nuremberg
Tribunal of 1948:
Principle VI: The following are
punishable as crimes under
international law:
A. Crimes Against
Peace—Planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression or a war in violation of
international treaties, agreements,
or assurances.
B. War Crimes—Violations of
the laws or customs of war which
include, but are not limited to,
murder, ill-treatment or
deportation of civilian population

of or in occupied territory;
murder or ill-treatment of
prisoners of war or persons on the
seas; killing of hostages, plunder
of public or private property,
wanton destruction of cities,
towns or villages, or devastation
not justified by military necessity.
C. Crimes Against Humanity:
Murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation and
other inhuman acts, done against
any civilian population, or
persecutions on political, racial or
religious grounds, when such acts
are done in execution of or in
connection with any crime against
peace or any war crime.
Our army and air force have
committed inhuman acts,
numerous in their documentation,
against civilian populations, acts
that only the most entrenched
insanity would judge justifiable or
in any way necessary. They are
guilty of war crimes, and crimes
against humanity.
Our nation is guilty of these
crimes under the Nuremberg
principles which we agreed to.
And consider another of these
principles, principle VII:
"Complicity in the commission
of a crime against humanity is a
crime under international law."
For those that doubt the guilt
or complicity of Stanford
University, consider these facts.

Stanford owns more than $33
million in stocks and bonds in the
following corporations:
Atlantic-Itichfield, American
Telephone and Telegraph, Bell
and Howell, Caterpillar Tractor,
Food Machinery Corporation,
Ford Motor Company, General
Electric, General Motors, General
Telephone and Electronics,
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Gulf
Oil, Hewlett-Packard,
International Telephone and
Telegraph, Kaiser Aluminum and
Chemical, Sperry Rand, Standard
Oil of California, Standard Oil of
New Jersey, Texaco, Union
Carbide and Westinghouse
Electric.
These are corporations that are
providing the fuel, the weapons,
the bombs, the guidance and
control systems, and the vehicles
with which the American military
machine is murdering civilian
populations in Southeast Asia.
General Electric, for example,
makes components for
an ti-personnel fragmentation
weapons. Sperry-Rand assembles
those weapons. Together, these 20
corporations hold more than $4'/2
billion in Department of Defense
contracts.
Corporations that feed and arm
a criminal war machine are
themselves criminal, and
individuals and institutions which
invest money in these
corporations are deeply
implicated in this criminality.
As far as possible, Stanford
should vote its stock proxies in
favor of ending DOD contracting
by these corporations and
directing their research and
productive capacities toward
attacking urgent domestic
problems.
Failing this, however, there is
only one alternative consistent
with the ethics of international
law and human decency—and that
is for Stanford to divest itself of
its holdings in these war
corporations and re-invest them in
corporations which are
researching and producing to
better human life rather than
destroy it.

There has been much talk in
recent weeks of the relative guilt
or innocence of Lt. William
Galley. Some question whether it
is correct and fair to prosecute
him without also prosecuting the
highest ranks in the military and
civilian commands, who have
planned, ordered and are
ultimately responsible for
American crimes of war in
Indochina.
But if our government is guilty
of war crimes, the burden of guilt
ultimately settles on all of us as
well. Just as a government is
responsible for the conduct of its
armies in the field and its air force
above, so is a people responsible
for the policies and actions of its
government.
Consider the following
principles from the Nuremberg
Tribunal of 1948:
Principle VI: The following are
punishable as crimes under
international law:
A. Crimes Against
Peace—Planning, preparation,
initiation or waging of a war of
aggression or a war in violation of
international treaties, agreements,
or assurances.
B. War Crimes—Violations of
the laws or customs of war which
include, but are not limited to,
murder, ill-treatment or
deportation of civilian population

of or in occupied territory;
murder or ill-treatment of
prisoners of war or persons on the
seas; killing of hostages, plunder
of public or private property,
wanton destruction of cities,
towns or villages, or devastation
not justified by military necessity.
C. Crimes Against Humanity:
Murder, extermination,
enslavement, deportation and
other inhuman acts, done against
any civilian population, or
persecutions on political, racial or
religious grounds, when such acts
are done in execution of or in
connection with any crime against
peace or any war crime.
Our army and air force have
committed inhuman acts,
numerous in their documentation,
against civilian populations, acts
that only the most entrenched
insanity would judge justifiable or
in any way necessary. They are
guilty of war crimes, and crimes
against humanity.
Our nation is guilty of these
crimes under the Nuremberg
principles which we agreed to.
And consider another of these
principles, principle VII:
"Complicity in the commission
of a crime against humanity is a
crime under international law."
For those that doubt the guilt
or complicity of Stanford
University, consider these facts.

Stanford owns more than $33
million in stocks and bonds in the
following corporations:
Atlantic-Itichfield, American
Telephone and Telegraph, Bell
and Howell, Caterpillar Tractor,
Food Machinery Corporation,
Ford Motor Company, General
Electric, General Motors, General
Telephone and Electronics,
Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Gulf
Oil, Hewlett-Packard,
International Telephone and
Telegraph, Kaiser Aluminum and
Chemical, Sperry Rand, Standard
Oil of California, Standard Oil of
New Jersey, Texaco, Union
Carbide and Westinghouse
Electric.
These are corporations that are
providing the fuel, the weapons,
the bombs, the guidance and
control systems, and the vehicles
with which the American military
machine is murdering civilian
populations in Southeast Asia.
General Electric, for example,
makes components for
an ti-personnel fragmentation
weapons. Sperry-Rand assembles
those weapons. Together, these 20
corporations hold more than $4'/2
billion in Department of Defense
contracts.
Corporations that feed and arm
a criminal war machine are
themselves criminal, and
individuals and institutions which
invest money in these
corporations are deeply
implicated in this criminality.
As far as possible, Stanford
should vote its stock proxies in
favor of ending DOD contracting
by these corporations and
directing their research and
productive capacities toward
attacking urgent domestic
problems.
Failing this, however, there is
only one alternative consistent
with the ethics of international
law and human decency—and that
is for Stanford to divest itself of
its holdings in these war
corporations and re-invest them in
corporations which are
researching and producing to
better human life rather than
destroy it.
