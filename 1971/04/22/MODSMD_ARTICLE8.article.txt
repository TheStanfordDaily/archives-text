# New Hiking Path Opened In Foothills
## 
### LINDA MUTSCHLER 
The University's "closed
fence" policy in the foothills may
at last be broken thanks to the
efforts of Jim Absher, a senior in
human biology. Absher has
managed to talk university
officials into opening a hiking
path and trail over the previously
fenced off land behind campus.
The path will be open on an
experimental basis for the rest of
the quarter and if university fears
of vandalism and fire are quelled,
this path and a more extensive
system of trails will be opened to
the Stanford community on a
permanent basis.
"We don't want a park,"
Absher emphasizes. "We can't go
public. No drinking fountains or
sanitary facilities. The whole
purpose is minimal
development—a place where you
can just cross the fence, eat your
lunch, and maybe walk a little."
First Trail Opening
The first approved trail begins
at Foothill Expressway and
Stanford Avenue, looping several
miles through the hills to end at
May field Avenue and Foothill.
Work on the path began last
weekend; Absher is calling for
students willing to brave poison
oak and blisters again this
Saturday. Volunteers are asked to

bring gloves and tools to the
ASSU office in Tresidder Union at
9 a.m. He hopes the trail will be
ready for use Sunday.
Now open only to cows and
research workers, the area
concerned includes 1700
essentially undeveloped acres
south of the main campus:
everything south of Junipero
Serra Boulevard and east of
Alpine Road. Most of the land is
on "academic reserve" and is
leased for agricultural uses, mainly
as grazing areas. But nearly 1100
"alienable" acres are not
protected against sale by the
Stanfords' original grant, and the
Livingston "Policy/Plan" calls for
some residential development.
Instead, Jim Absher would like to
see it kept as open land.
Nice Campus Places
Absher first noticed the area
while compiling a book of "nice
places around campus" for a
Human Biology workshop
requirement. He noted the
off-limits hilly areas and started
asking questions; reasons for
fencing off the land ranged from
fire hazards to vandalism in
research centers to. simply
protecting the cattle.
A quarter of "planning
optimistically" and overcoming
these problems followed. Absher
met with Boyd Smith of the
Planning Office and Ken
Cuthbertson, Vice-President of
Finance. Finally a proposal was
produced for an area including
Felt Lake, the Ridge, Matadero
and Los Trancos Creeks,
Frenchman's Tower, and the area
between the two Page Mill Roads.
The trail system will incorporate
dirt roads and cow paths already
leading into the area.
With the opening of the land
come difficulties in regulating its
use. Only a limited number of
passes will be available for
members of the Stanford
community and their guests.

These will be available after
Thursday afternoon in the real
estate office, Encina 105, Ext.
2229.
Rules for Use
The land will be open only
during daylight hours, and a
complete set of rules including
those prohibiting smoking,
littering and pets, have been
drawn up. "We've got no money
behind this proposal," explains
Absher. "We had to talk people
into making entrance signs and
gates for us. So we have to depend
on people to stay away from
research plants and cattle, and not
to litter.
"Boyd Smith and I will walk
that trail in June, and if things are
working well, someone else will
take over when I graduate, and
the entire trail plan should be
finished next year. If not, it'll be
back to hopping the fences
without authorization."
Vandalism has been a major
problem at research facilities
housing expensive equipment near
Stanford. Absher feels that the
greater numbers of hikers in the
area during the day may actually
help cut down on damage. Due to

lack of funding, policing of the
park by groups such as the
Conservation Club is uncertain.
Parking should be no problem
at all. "We want to discourage the
use of cars," says Absher.
"Therefore there aren't any
parking facilities. It's an easy walk
from the Quad."
Stanford community members
who use the new trail will fill out
a questionnaire in June. The
results will be combined with
other study materials and
presented to the Land and
Building Development Committee
to determine the future of
Absher's project. If expanded
fully, the trails would wind from
Foothill Expressway around Felt
Lake, crossing the open land in
between several times—"a good
day's hike," says Absher.

estate office, Encina 105, Ext.
2229.
Rules for Use
The land will be open only
during daylight hours, and a
complete set of rules including
those prohibiting smoking,
littering and pets, have been
drawn up. "We've got no money
behind this proposal," explains
Absher. "We had to talk people
into making entrance signs and
gates for us. So we have to depend
on people to stay away from
research plants and cattle, and not
to litter.
"Boyd Smith and I will walk
that trail in June, and if things are
working well, someone else will
take over when I graduate, and
the entire trail plan should be
finished next year. If not, it'll be
back to hopping the fences
without authorization."
Vandalism has been a major
problem at research facilities
housing expensive equipment near
Stanford. Absher feels that the
greater numbers of hikers in the
area during the day may actually
help cut down on damage. Due to

lack of funding, policing of the
park by groups such as the
Conservation Club is uncertain.
Parking should be no problem
at all. "We want to discourage the
use of cars," says Absher.
"Therefore there aren't any
parking facilities. It's an easy walk
from the Quad."
Stanford community members
who use the new trail will fill out
a questionnaire in June. The
results will be combined with
other study materials and
presented to the Land and
Building Development Committee
to determine the future of
Absher's project. If expanded
fully, the trails would wind from
Foothill Expressway around Felt
Lake, crossing the open land in
between several times—"a good
day's hike," says Absher.

OPEN COUNTRY—Formerly closed ranchland in back of Lake Lag
will be opened shortly as an experimental hiking trail is being dug into
the grounds.
The University's "closed
fence" policy in the foothills may
at last be broken thanks to the
efforts of Jim Absher, a senior in
human biology. Absher has
managed to talk university
officials into opening a hiking
path and trail over the previously
fenced off land behind campus.
The path will be open on an
experimental basis for the rest of
the quarter and if university fears
of vandalism and fire are quelled,
this path and a more extensive
system of trails will be opened to
the Stanford community on a
permanent basis.
"We don't want a park,"
Absher emphasizes. "We can't go
public. No drinking fountains or
sanitary facilities. The whole
purpose is minimal
development—a place where you
can just cross the fence, eat your
lunch, and maybe walk a little."
First Trail Opening
The first approved trail begins
at Foothill Expressway and
Stanford Avenue, looping several
miles through the hills to end at
May field Avenue and Foothill.
Work on the path began last
weekend; Absher is calling for
students willing to brave poison
oak and blisters again this
Saturday. Volunteers are asked to

bring gloves and tools to the
ASSU office in Tresidder Union at
9 a.m. He hopes the trail will be
ready for use Sunday.
Now open only to cows and
research workers, the area
concerned includes 1700
essentially undeveloped acres
south of the main campus:
everything south of Junipero
Serra Boulevard and east of
Alpine Road. Most of the land is
on "academic reserve" and is
leased for agricultural uses, mainly
as grazing areas. But nearly 1100
"alienable" acres are not
protected against sale by the
Stanfords' original grant, and the
Livingston "Policy/Plan" calls for
some residential development.
Instead, Jim Absher would like to
see it kept as open land.
Nice Campus Places
Absher first noticed the area
while compiling a book of "nice
places around campus" for a
Human Biology workshop
requirement. He noted the
off-limits hilly areas and started
asking questions; reasons for
fencing off the land ranged from
fire hazards to vandalism in
research centers to. simply
protecting the cattle.
A quarter of "planning
optimistically" and overcoming
these problems followed. Absher
met with Boyd Smith of the
Planning Office and Ken
Cuthbertson, Vice-President of
Finance. Finally a proposal was
produced for an area including
Felt Lake, the Ridge, Matadero
and Los Trancos Creeks,
Frenchman's Tower, and the area
between the two Page Mill Roads.
The trail system will incorporate
dirt roads and cow paths already
leading into the area.
With the opening of the land
come difficulties in regulating its
use. Only a limited number of
passes will be available for
members of the Stanford
community and their guests.

These will be available after
Thursday afternoon in the real
estate office, Encina 105, Ext.
