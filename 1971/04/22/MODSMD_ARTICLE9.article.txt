# Sponsors Win Concession
## 
### 
Sponsors have won what one
sponsor called "a very partial
concession"â€”an additional
student member on committees to
pick their successors.
Procedures to pick next year's
dorm staffs have been attacked as
"bureaucratic and hierarchical"
by a majority of the dorm
sponsors. Until this year, the Dean
of Students Office had given
actual control of new sponsors to
the incumbents.
Two student staff members,
rather than one, will now be
placed on the five-man
committees screening
applications. Another student, an
administrator, and a faculty
member will complete the
interviewing teams.
The change means a student
majority on the screening
committees. But administrators
tempered this new rule with a
requirement for a four-member
consensus to approve an
applicant.
One administrator reported
that President Lyman personally
insisted on the four-man
consensus as a curb on student
power. But Acting Dean of
Students Bob Freelen said he and
other administrators had devised
the rule "to encourage the
committees to work together to
pick candidates they can all agree
upon."
One sponsor charged early
interview sessions with applicants
have been characterized by the
"bureaucratic shit" the sponsors
warned against. She said the
changes still limit sponsors to
"input" rather than real power in
selecting next year's staff.
