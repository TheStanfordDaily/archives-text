SERVICE
At Short Swing, service is the most important thing in
tennis —customer service, that is.
Take racquet restringing. Our stringers, Niven and
John, can take that old, dead, ragged, saggy stringed
racquet of yours, and improve its performance 100%.
They'll help you pick the proper string, correct gauge
and string tension that precisely fits your racquet—
and your tennis game.
SPECIAL RESTRING PRICE FOR STANFORD STUDENTS
