# Ping Pong Diplomacy Makes China New Ball Game
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL 
News Analysis
The People's Republic of China surprised America last week when it served a
group of American table tennis players an invitation to visit China, and then
followed through with friendly hospitality during a visit Premier Chou En-lai
described as "the opening of a new page in the relations of the American and
Chinese people."
Just as the Chinese adopted a novel grip on the ping-pong paddle on their way
to mastery over the table-tennis world, their novel use of such "Ping-Pong
diplomacy" is one aspect of the policy China is employing in an attempt to gain a
firmer hold on international politics.
The rallying began last week when the Chinese invited the 15-member U.S.
delegation at the World Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo to visit China,
along with three newsmen. The group toured Peking, visited the Great Wall of
China, played in an exhibition table tennis match against the Chinese third team,
and met with Chou En-lai for about two hours. Nixon used the visit as a
convenient excuse to announce a relaxation of trade and visitation policies that
has been under consideration for over nine yeras.
No Breakthrough
Although the ping-pong affair represents China's new innovative, flexible,
foreign policy and offers hope for more formal contacts in the future, it cannot be
seen as a major breakthrough in Sino-American relations. The visit was pointedly
not a contact between governments; the New China News Agency stated, "The
peoples and players of China and the U.S. are friendly to each other," while
continuing to condemn U.S. imperialist policies.
Why was this informal contact made through a table-tennis team, rather than
through a public or political figure? Stanford Assistant Professor of History
Lyman Van Slyke, an expert on modern China, points out that the invitation of
an apolitical group of athletes allowed China to avoid implying statements they
wouldn't want to make.
Nixon might have interpreted it as a hostile act the official invitation of a critic
of the administration, while the invitation of an administration official would
have implied acquiescence to American policies. The convenient presence of the
U.S. team in Japan allowed the Chinese to avoid a dramatic invitation laden with
political overtones.
The significance of ping-pong diplomacy must be considered in light of new
developments in Chinese foreign policy as a whole. Stanford Professor of Political
Science John Lewis points out that China has adopted a "flexible, innovative
strategy" in contrast tb their "rigid, introverted" behavior up through the Cultural

Revolution. Now that the government has been stabilized under the Idealogy of
Chairman Mao and the administration of Chou En-lai, and industrial and
agricultural production is rising, China can once again turn outward.
More Conventional
China is now adopting more conventional diplomatic- relations with other
countries, while compromising on positions to which it once held fast.
The new Chinese strategy is, according to Lewis, a two-pronged unfolding "in
the direction of accommodation and revolution, involving some risk-taking in an
effort to increase their security." Though China in the past avoided trying to
influence revolutions in Asia for fear of counterproductive responses, it is now
committed to the successful outcome of united front activity in Indochina.
Such a policy involves a risk, as China lacks direct control over the actions of
individual nations. Yet the American defeat in Laos and the general trend of the
war have made the Chinese feel, in Lewis' words, "enormously successful."
Lewis believes that the Chinese may also take risks in seeking accommodation
with the West: expanding diplomatic relations, softening its position on
Nationalist China, and inviting U.S. ping-pong players to the mainland, all with
the hope of encouraging further contact with the West.
Just as a successful ping-pong player responds to new attacks from his
opponents, China's general foreign policy and the specific gestures toward the
U.S. are designed, according to Lewis, to respond to changing situations in Asia.
Response to New Role
First, China is seeking a response to the changing role of the United States in
Asia, exemplified by the Nixon doctrine. China hopes that united front tactics

will succeed on a military level, and that some accommodation with the U.S.
might lead to decreased American influence in Indochina.
Secondly, China must respond to the burgeoning economic power of Japan.
Some accommodation with the U.S., accompanied by growing diplomatic power,
would make it easier for China to reach a political equilibrium with Japan.
Thirdly, China wishes to alter its political relation to Russia and other
Communist nations. The Chinese hope that a small degree of accommodation
could lead the U.S. to stop blocking Communist China's entry into the U.N., thus
allowing China to adopt a position of leadership over more of the Communist
world.
Future Uncertain
1" uture Chinese actions are difficult to predict, although some implications are
fairly evident. Having taken the initial steps, Nixon will probably continue to
loosen trade and travel restrictions regarding China. Some experts predict trade
could amount to several hundred million dollars over the next decade.
China's new policy is certain to significantly alter the structure of the U.N. and
the status of the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan. The U.S. has for
several years secured passage of an "important question" resolution in the U.N.
General Assembly, which makes a 2/3 vote of the Assembly necessary for the
admission of Red China. The U.S. might find introduction of the important
question resolution politically undesirable in light of China's new stance, so that
the People's Republic could be seated during the next session.
Nixon told his advisers last week, "I was quite a ping-pong player in my days at
law school. I might say I was fairly good at it." We can only hope that when
Nixon's turn comes to serve, he won't drop the ball.

described as "the opening of a new page in the relations of the American and
Chinese people."
Just as the Chinese adopted a novel grip on the ping-pong paddle on their way
to mastery over the table-tennis world, their novel use of such "Ping-Pong
diplomacy" is one aspect of the policy China is employing in an attempt to gain a
firmer hold on international politics.
The rallying began last week when the Chinese invited the 15-member U.S.
delegation at the World Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo to visit China,
along with three newsmen. The group toured Peking, visited the Great Wall of
China, played in an exhibition table tennis match against the Chinese third team,
and met with Chou En-lai for about two hours. Nixon used the visit as a
convenient excuse to announce a relaxation of trade and visitation policies that
has been under consideration for over nine yeras.
No Breakthrough
Although the ping-pong affair represents China's new innovative, flexible,
foreign policy and offers hope for more formal contacts in the future, it cannot be
seen as a major breakthrough in Sino-American relations. The visit was pointedly
not a contact between governments; the New China News Agency stated, "The
peoples and players of China and the U.S. are friendly to each other," while
continuing to condemn U.S. imperialist policies.
Why was this informal contact made through a table-tennis team, rather than
through a public or political figure? Stanford Assistant Professor of History
Lyman Van Slyke, an expert on modern China, points out that the invitation of
an apolitical group of athletes allowed China to avoid implying statements they
wouldn't want to make.
Nixon might have interpreted it as a hostile act the official invitation of a critic
of the administration, while the invitation of an administration official would
have implied acquiescence to American policies. The convenient presence of the
U.S. team in Japan allowed the Chinese to avoid a dramatic invitation laden with
political overtones.
The significance of ping-pong diplomacy must be considered in light of new
developments in Chinese foreign policy as a whole. Stanford Professor of Political
Science John Lewis points out that China has adopted a "flexible, innovative
strategy" in contrast tb their "rigid, introverted" behavior up through the Cultural

Revolution. Now that the government has been stabilized under the Idealogy of
Chairman Mao and the administration of Chou En-lai, and industrial and
agricultural production is rising, China can once again turn outward.
More Conventional
China is now adopting more conventional diplomatic- relations with other
countries, while compromising on positions to which it once held fast.
The new Chinese strategy is, according to Lewis, a two-pronged unfolding "in
the direction of accommodation and revolution, involving some risk-taking in an
effort to increase their security." Though China in the past avoided trying to
influence revolutions in Asia for fear of counterproductive responses, it is now
committed to the successful outcome of united front activity in Indochina.
Such a policy involves a risk, as China lacks direct control over the actions of
individual nations. Yet the American defeat in Laos and the general trend of the
war have made the Chinese feel, in Lewis' words, "enormously successful."
Lewis believes that the Chinese may also take risks in seeking accommodation
with the West: expanding diplomatic relations, softening its position on
Nationalist China, and inviting U.S. ping-pong players to the mainland, all with
the hope of encouraging further contact with the West.
Just as a successful ping-pong player responds to new attacks from his
opponents, China's general foreign policy and the specific gestures toward the
U.S. are designed, according to Lewis, to respond to changing situations in Asia.
Response to New Role
First, China is seeking a response to the changing role of the United States in
Asia, exemplified by the Nixon doctrine. China hopes that united front tactics

will succeed on a military level, and that some accommodation with the U.S.
might lead to decreased American influence in Indochina.
Secondly, China must respond to the burgeoning economic power of Japan.
Some accommodation with the U.S., accompanied by growing diplomatic power,
would make it easier for China to reach a political equilibrium with Japan.
Thirdly, China wishes to alter its political relation to Russia and other
Communist nations. The Chinese hope that a small degree of accommodation
could lead the U.S. to stop blocking Communist China's entry into the U.N., thus
allowing China to adopt a position of leadership over more of the Communist
world.
Future Uncertain
1" uture Chinese actions are difficult to predict, although some implications are
fairly evident. Having taken the initial steps, Nixon will probably continue to
loosen trade and travel restrictions regarding China. Some experts predict trade
could amount to several hundred million dollars over the next decade.
China's new policy is certain to significantly alter the structure of the U.N. and
the status of the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan. The U.S. has for
several years secured passage of an "important question" resolution in the U.N.
General Assembly, which makes a 2/3 vote of the Assembly necessary for the
admission of Red China. The U.S. might find introduction of the important
question resolution politically undesirable in light of China's new stance, so that
the People's Republic could be seated during the next session.
Nixon told his advisers last week, "I was quite a ping-pong player in my days at
law school. I might say I was fairly good at it." We can only hope that when
Nixon's turn comes to serve, he won't drop the ball.

to mastery over the table-tennis world, their novel use of such "Ping-Pong
diplomacy" is one aspect of the policy China is employing in an attempt to gain a
firmer hold on international politics.
The rallying began last week when the Chinese invited the 15-member U.S.
delegation at the World Table Tennis Championships in Tokyo to visit China,
along with three newsmen. The group toured Peking, visited the Great Wall of
China, played in an exhibition table tennis match against the Chinese third team,
and met with Chou En-lai for about two hours. Nixon used the visit as a
convenient excuse to announce a relaxation of trade and visitation policies that
has been under consideration for over nine yeras.
No Breakthrough
Although the ping-pong affair represents China's new innovative, flexible,
foreign policy and offers hope for more formal contacts in the future, it cannot be
seen as a major breakthrough in Sino-American relations. The visit was pointedly
not a contact between governments; the New China News Agency stated, "The
peoples and players of China and the U.S. are friendly to each other," while
continuing to condemn U.S. imperialist policies.
Why was this informal contact made through a table-tennis team, rather than
through a public or political figure? Stanford Assistant Professor of History
Lyman Van Slyke, an expert on modern China, points out that the invitation of
an apolitical group of athletes allowed China to avoid implying statements they
wouldn't want to make.
Nixon might have interpreted it as a hostile act the official invitation of a critic
of the administration, while the invitation of an administration official would
have implied acquiescence to American policies. The convenient presence of the
U.S. team in Japan allowed the Chinese to avoid a dramatic invitation laden with
political overtones.
The significance of ping-pong diplomacy must be considered in light of new
developments in Chinese foreign policy as a whole. Stanford Professor of Political
Science John Lewis points out that China has adopted a "flexible, innovative
strategy" in contrast tb their "rigid, introverted" behavior up through the Cultural

Revolution. Now that the government has been stabilized under the Idealogy of
Chairman Mao and the administration of Chou En-lai, and industrial and
agricultural production is rising, China can once again turn outward.
More Conventional
China is now adopting more conventional diplomatic- relations with other
countries, while compromising on positions to which it once held fast.
The new Chinese strategy is, according to Lewis, a two-pronged unfolding "in
the direction of accommodation and revolution, involving some risk-taking in an
effort to increase their security." Though China in the past avoided trying to
influence revolutions in Asia for fear of counterproductive responses, it is now
committed to the successful outcome of united front activity in Indochina.
Such a policy involves a risk, as China lacks direct control over the actions of
individual nations. Yet the American defeat in Laos and the general trend of the
war have made the Chinese feel, in Lewis' words, "enormously successful."
Lewis believes that the Chinese may also take risks in seeking accommodation
with the West: expanding diplomatic relations, softening its position on
Nationalist China, and inviting U.S. ping-pong players to the mainland, all with
the hope of encouraging further contact with the West.
Just as a successful ping-pong player responds to new attacks from his
opponents, China's general foreign policy and the specific gestures toward the
U.S. are designed, according to Lewis, to respond to changing situations in Asia.
Response to New Role
First, China is seeking a response to the changing role of the United States in
Asia, exemplified by the Nixon doctrine. China hopes that united front tactics

will succeed on a military level, and that some accommodation with the U.S.
might lead to decreased American influence in Indochina.
Secondly, China must respond to the burgeoning economic power of Japan.
Some accommodation with the U.S., accompanied by growing diplomatic power,
would make it easier for China to reach a political equilibrium with Japan.
Thirdly, China wishes to alter its political relation to Russia and other
Communist nations. The Chinese hope that a small degree of accommodation
could lead the U.S. to stop blocking Communist China's entry into the U.N., thus
allowing China to adopt a position of leadership over more of the Communist
world.
Future Uncertain
1" uture Chinese actions are difficult to predict, although some implications are
fairly evident. Having taken the initial steps, Nixon will probably continue to
loosen trade and travel restrictions regarding China. Some experts predict trade
could amount to several hundred million dollars over the next decade.
China's new policy is certain to significantly alter the structure of the U.N. and
the status of the Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan. The U.S. has for
several years secured passage of an "important question" resolution in the U.N.
General Assembly, which makes a 2/3 vote of the Assembly necessary for the
admission of Red China. The U.S. might find introduction of the important
question resolution politically undesirable in light of China's new stance, so that
the People's Republic could be seated during the next session.
Nixon told his advisers last week, "I was quite a ping-pong player in my days at
law school. I might say I was fairly good at it." We can only hope that when
Nixon's turn comes to serve, he won't drop the ball.
