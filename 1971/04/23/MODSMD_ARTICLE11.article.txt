# Foreign Students Waver On IA's Political Stance
## 
### ELIZABETH ALDRICH 
"In the politicization of this
campus, foreign students have
departed in many ways from
American students," claims
French graduate student Gilles
Kahn, former president of the
International Association (1A).
Just what the political
orientation of the IA is or ought
to be is a matter of some dispute.
Only two years ago the
organization established its right
to take political positions—exer
cised last spring in the lA's
support of the Off-ROTC
movement. However, no
comparable stands have been
taken this year.
"We've unofficially agreed it's
not useful any more to make
statements like 'We condemn, we
support such-and-such'," Kahn
explained. But an apparent desire
for concrete action prompted the
1A just a few weeks back to
allocate $100 as a donation for
medical supplies in Indochina.
Kahn pointed out the problems
foreign students encounter in
becoming politically active:
"Some foreigners consider
themselves guests of the U.S.
Government; as a consequence
they don't feel they have the right
to speak. Others think of
themselves as guests of the
American citizens themselves, and
say, 'If I'm in for their fight, I will
help them inasmuch as I don't
break the law.' A third group,
realizing that certain international
laws dealing with political
activism may result in deportation
from the U.S., would prefer to
remain anonymous if they do take
part in political activity."
Some foreign students regret
the lA's growing political
involvement. Alberto Uribe, a
Colombian in Chemical
Engineering, complains that "as
the IA has become much more
politically oriented in the last
year, it doesn't concentrate so

much on representing the students
as a whole.
Other students level the
opposite charge. Ila Montalvo, a
sophomore from Peru, declares,
"You accomplish nothing by
taking no stands, but even less by
putting out statements that are so
watered down anyone would
agree with them. Instead of little
projects here and there and
cultural events to support, the IA
should concentrate on bringing
more good foreign speakers to the
campus.
Some difficulties within the IA
stem from the fact that, as Lee
Zeigler, Associate Director of the
I-Center, puts it, "There are
always personality problems in a
place as heterogeneous as this."
Students from countries which are
at war or simply at odds with each
other often find it uncomfortable
or even impossible to work
together.
The IA Policy Board must be
sensitive to all these conflicts. At
the same time it tries to preserve
some sort of unity. The job is not
easy. Pamela Sunday, a
Californian, and one of the 17
board members, revealed that she
senses "a feeling of helplessness
about being on the Board. We are
isolated not only from the staff
(of the I-Center), but from most
of the students, and we're
ineffective because there is no

communication with any sort of
authority."
R a mesh Agarwal, new
president of IA stated his
position, saying: "I feel we need
to create a sense of awareness
among foreign students that there
is an organization which can speak
for them in the University
community and administration in
various ways on issues affecting
the social and political life of
foreign students.
"There has been a lack of link
with the staff of I-Center in the
past. I wish to propose a foreign
students committee which would
represent IA in some of the
I-Center decision making
processes which directly affect the
life of foreign students at
Stanford. 1 hope to seek better
co-operation from I-Center
management this year."

The new IA would be
"different in character, but
analogous in function to the
BSU," said Kahn, "in that it
would represent the specific
interests of a group of students."
But even this purpose would
not be easily accomplished. Like
other organizations in intensely
political times, the International
Association would still have to
struggle with the problem of
whether an organization must
concentrate on its function as a
representative body, or should use
its power primarily as "the voice
of the people" in politically
oriented activities.
Kahn, whose term as president
ended last month, does feel the
necessity for some sort of change:
"1 have proposed a new
constitution; the need now seems
to be for an organization

representing foreign students
separately from American
students, mainly because of the
increasing inward turn of
American political interests."

Just what the political
orientation of the IA is or ought
to be is a matter of some dispute.
Only two years ago the
organization established its right
to take political positions—exer
cised last spring in the lA's
support of the Off-ROTC
movement. However, no
comparable stands have been
taken this year.
"We've unofficially agreed it's
not useful any more to make
statements like 'We condemn, we
support such-and-such'," Kahn
explained. But an apparent desire
for concrete action prompted the
1A just a few weeks back to
allocate $100 as a donation for
medical supplies in Indochina.
Kahn pointed out the problems
foreign students encounter in
becoming politically active:
"Some foreigners consider
themselves guests of the U.S.
Government; as a consequence
they don't feel they have the right
to speak. Others think of
themselves as guests of the
American citizens themselves, and
say, 'If I'm in for their fight, I will
help them inasmuch as I don't
break the law.' A third group,
realizing that certain international
laws dealing with political
activism may result in deportation
from the U.S., would prefer to
remain anonymous if they do take
part in political activity."
Some foreign students regret
the lA's growing political
involvement. Alberto Uribe, a
Colombian in Chemical
Engineering, complains that "as
the IA has become much more
politically oriented in the last
year, it doesn't concentrate so

much on representing the students
as a whole.
Other students level the
opposite charge. Ila Montalvo, a
sophomore from Peru, declares,
"You accomplish nothing by
taking no stands, but even less by
putting out statements that are so
watered down anyone would
agree with them. Instead of little
projects here and there and
cultural events to support, the IA
should concentrate on bringing
more good foreign speakers to the
campus.
Some difficulties within the IA
stem from the fact that, as Lee
Zeigler, Associate Director of the
I-Center, puts it, "There are
always personality problems in a
place as heterogeneous as this."
Students from countries which are
at war or simply at odds with each
other often find it uncomfortable
or even impossible to work
together.
The IA Policy Board must be
sensitive to all these conflicts. At
the same time it tries to preserve
some sort of unity. The job is not
easy. Pamela Sunday, a
Californian, and one of the 17
board members, revealed that she
senses "a feeling of helplessness
about being on the Board. We are
isolated not only from the staff
(of the I-Center), but from most
of the students, and we're
ineffective because there is no

communication with any sort of
authority."
R a mesh Agarwal, new
president of IA stated his
position, saying: "I feel we need
to create a sense of awareness
among foreign students that there
is an organization which can speak
for them in the University
community and administration in
various ways on issues affecting
the social and political life of
foreign students.
"There has been a lack of link
with the staff of I-Center in the
past. I wish to propose a foreign
students committee which would
represent IA in some of the
I-Center decision making
processes which directly affect the
life of foreign students at
Stanford. 1 hope to seek better
co-operation from I-Center
management this year."

The new IA would be
"different in character, but
analogous in function to the
BSU," said Kahn, "in that it
would represent the specific
interests of a group of students."
But even this purpose would
not be easily accomplished. Like
other organizations in intensely
political times, the International
Association would still have to
struggle with the problem of
whether an organization must
concentrate on its function as a
representative body, or should use
its power primarily as "the voice
of the people" in politically
oriented activities.
Kahn, whose term as president
ended last month, does feel the
necessity for some sort of change:
"1 have proposed a new
constitution; the need now seems
to be for an organization

representing foreign students
separately from American
students, mainly because of the
increasing inward turn of
American political interests."
"In the politicization of this
campus, foreign students have
departed in many ways from
American students," claims
French graduate student Gilles
Kahn, former president of the
International Association (1A).
