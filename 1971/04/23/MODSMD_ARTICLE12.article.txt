# Oriental, Indian Art Show
## 
### JEAN L. FINCH 
Two stunning shows, widely
diverse, have hearalded Spring
Quarter here. In the Miedel Room
of the Stanford Museum, an
unusual exhibition of Chinese and
Japanese color prints may be seen
until May 16.
The prints, delicate and
exquisite in themselves, are
beautifully hung in the spacious
room where even the soft greens
and golds of the Chinese rug echo
their lovely tints.
This is a unique show from
several points of view. First,
although Japanese color wood
blocks are somewhat nown in
the West from their influence on
the French Impressionists, in the
1880's, Chinese color wood
blocks are rarely seen.
One reason may be that
although the art of wood block

printing and especially color wood
block printing in China dates to
about 1622 A.D. with the
publication in Nanking of the
painting manual by Hu
Cheng-yen, "Bamboo Drawings yf
the Snow Hall," this art form
never achieved a separate entity as
it did in Japan where it was
introduced from China. The
Chinese tended to use color wood
block printing to similate a
painting style.
Secondly, this show was
chosen and hung by members of
Professor Michael Sullivan's
Oriental Art Seminar from the
collections of the Achenbach
Foundation, the Stanford
University Museum and the
Nathan Cummings Art Library.
These students are: Louisa Read,
Kao Mei-ch'ing, Deborah
Holzmann, Thomas McDonnell,

Charles Ferree and Shirley Sun.
The exhibition includes four
editions of the "Painting Manual
of the Ten Bamboo Hall," one of
the first books printed in color,
originally published in 1633.
There are also prints from several
editions of the "Mustard Seed
Garden," a seventeenth century
painting manual still used today,
which has seen many reprintings
also in Japan.
The Japanese prints are not the
typical actors of the ukiyo-e, or
art of the floating world, but the
less familiar prints by Utamaro
and Hiroshige, who worked in the
Chinese style. Rarest of all is a
copy of "Chichi no On"
(Indebtedness to One's Father) of
1730, the earlies example of true
color printing in Japan.
There are additional Chinese
color wood block prints on view
in the lobby of the Cummings Art
Building and in the Main Reading
Room of the Art Library for a
total perspective.

The North American Indian
Art from the Stanford University
Collections on view in the
Stanford Art Gallery is a totally
different perspective. It is rich and
earthy and very dynamic in
contrast to the ethereal beauty of
the Chinese and Japanese prints.
It is perhaps surprising that the
Stanford Collection is so rich and
varied in scope but its origins date
back to the 1890s. The similarly
wide-ranging Colburn Collection
came into the Stanford Museum
in the late '90s. Selections from
this impressive collection will
occupy two shows: the first
running until May 16 and the
second, beginning in mid-June and
continuing through the summer in
the Stanford Art Gallery.
The present exhibition includes
outstanding baskets from both the
Southwestern Indians and the

Indians of Northern California. A
large Apache storage basket
intricately incorporates human
and animal figures in its design.
Although basketr>' preceeded
pottery in the prehistoric Indian
cultures, it is the pottery which
survived the centuries.
Also on view are some
handsome leather vestments,
pouches and moccasins decorated
with beadwork and porcupine
quills from the Plains Indians,
such as the Sioux and the
Cheyenne.

Art from the Stanford University
Collections on view in the
Stanford Art Gallery is a totally
different perspective. It is rich and
earthy and very dynamic in
contrast to the ethereal beauty of
the Chinese and Japanese prints.
It is perhaps surprising that the
Stanford Collection is so rich and
varied in scope but its origins date
back to the 1890s. The similarly
wide-ranging Colburn Collection
came into the Stanford Museum
in the late '90s. Selections from
this impressive collection will
occupy two shows: the first
running until May 16 and the
second, beginning in mid-June and
continuing through the summer in
the Stanford Art Gallery.
The present exhibition includes
outstanding baskets from both the
Southwestern Indians and the

Indians of Northern California. A
large Apache storage basket
intricately incorporates human
and animal figures in its design.
Although basketr>' preceeded
pottery in the prehistoric Indian
cultures, it is the pottery which
survived the centuries.
Also on view are some
handsome leather vestments,
pouches and moccasins decorated
with beadwork and porcupine
quills from the Plains Indians,
such as the Sioux and the
Cheyenne.

INDIAN BASKEY- North American Indian Art is being shown at the
Art Gallery here. In this Apache storage basket, frontal figures hover
over profiled horses, suggesting symbolically the act of riding. Plain
and dyed sumac is sewn in a coiling technique.
Two stunning shows, widely
diverse, have hearalded Spring
Quarter here. In the Miedel Room
of the Stanford Museum, an
unusual exhibition of Chinese and
Japanese color prints may be seen
until May 16.
The prints, delicate and
exquisite in themselves, are
beautifully hung in the spacious
room where even the soft greens
and golds of the Chinese rug echo
their lovely tints.
This is a unique show from
several points of view. First,
although Japanese color wood
blocks are somewhat nown in
the West from their influence on
the French Impressionists, in the
1880's, Chinese color wood
blocks are rarely seen.
One reason may be that
although the art of wood block

printing and especially color wood
block printing in China dates to
about 1622 A.D. with the
publication in Nanking of the
painting manual by Hu
Cheng-yen, "Bamboo Drawings yf
the Snow Hall," this art form
never achieved a separate entity as
it did in Japan where it was
introduced from China. The
Chinese tended to use color wood
block printing to similate a
painting style.
Secondly, this show was
chosen and hung by members of
Professor Michael Sullivan's
Oriental Art Seminar from the
collections of the Achenbach
Foundation, the Stanford
University Museum and the
Nathan Cummings Art Library.
These students are: Louisa Read,
Kao Mei-ch'ing, Deborah
Holzmann, Thomas McDonnell,

Charles Ferree and Shirley Sun.
The exhibition includes four
editions of the "Painting Manual
of the Ten Bamboo Hall," one of
the first books printed in color,
originally published in 1633.
There are also prints from several
editions of the "Mustard Seed
Garden," a seventeenth century
painting manual still used today,
which has seen many reprintings
also in Japan.
The Japanese prints are not the
typical actors of the ukiyo-e, or
art of the floating world, but the
less familiar prints by Utamaro
and Hiroshige, who worked in the
Chinese style. Rarest of all is a
copy of "Chichi no On"
(Indebtedness to One's Father) of
1730, the earlies example of true
color printing in Japan.
There are additional Chinese
color wood block prints on view
in the lobby of the Cummings Art
Building and in the Main Reading
Room of the Art Library for a
total perspective.
