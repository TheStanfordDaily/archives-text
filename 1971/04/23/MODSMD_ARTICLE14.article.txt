# Indians Must Win
## 
### TOM QUINN 
Stanford's baseball contingent
prepares for its biggest weekend
of the season this year as it hosts
USC this aftenioon at 2:30 p.m.
and UCLA on Saturday for a
doubleheader at noon in Sunken
Diamond.
The Tribe dropped all three of
its games to their powerful foes to
the south last weekend, but coach
Ray Young feels that the Indians'
chances for at least two wins and
possibly a sweep "are very good

and USC and UCLA are not
invincible by any means. We
didn't play poorly down there;
the problem arose when we didn't
take advantage of the breaks."
The necessity of winning at
least two games hinges on the fact
that the Indians are bracketed in
the Southern Division of the
PAC-8 with USC, UCLA, and
California. USC leads the division
with a 4-0 record, followed by
UCLA at 3-1, and Stanford with a
1-3 league slate. Since only the
top two teams in the division go
on to the PAC-8 playoffs and
ultimately the College World
Series, the Indians must catch
either the Bruins or the Trojans.
