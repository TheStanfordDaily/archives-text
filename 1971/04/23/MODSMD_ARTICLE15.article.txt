Stanford is hosting the fourth
annual U.S. Collegiate Invitational
Golf Championship running from
Thursday through Saturday at the
Stanford Golf Course.
Gary Vanier, the 1971 San
Francisco City Champion, is the
defending titlist, but he will be
severely challenged in his bid to
defend the crown on his home
course.
Tom Watson appears to be
hitting top form after playing very
well last weekend as the Inians
split a pair of matches, defeating
Cal last Friday and losing to San
Jose State on Saturday.
Leading all scorers with a two
under par 70, Watson paced
Stanford to a 15 1/2 to 11 1/2
victory at Mira Vista.
