# Trackmen Challenge Trojans
## 
### 
The Indian Track & Field
squad, coming off a 68 2/3-85 1/3
loss to Oregon State, will
challenge the ever-powerful USC
Trojans at 1:15 p.m. this Saturday
in Stanford Stadium.
Coach Vern Wolfe's Trojans
have dual meet wins over Arizona
State, Occidental, California, and
Washington. Their victory over
the Huskies last Saturday was
highlighted by USC's capturing of
ten Ist places. The Indians have
lost the last 35 dual meets to
USC.
Stanford's hopes for an
honorable defeat rest with Casey
Carrigan in the pole vault, Allen
Meredith in the triple jump,
Duncan Mac Donald in the mile
run, Itandy White in the 440
intermediate hurdles, and Rick
Tipton in the high hurdles.
Carrigan barely missed at 17'

1" against Oregon State after
winning the competition at 16' 5
3/4" .
Meredith has a 50'-0" triple
jump to his credit this year. He
has a lifetime best of 52' 3"
established last season. Henry
Jackson, his principle USC
opponent, has done 50' 3"
already this season. Henry Hines,
a 26' long jumper, may also
challenge Meredith.
Rich Carr of USC has a 4:08.1
mile chalked up but Duncan
Mac Donald looks for a win
Saturday. Mac Donald, with a
3:59.6 lifetime best, is Stanford's
only sub-four minute miler. Last
week, competing against a stiff
breeze, he ran a 4:0.5.
Randy White, who won both
the 440 and the 440-intermediate
hurdles (48.2 and 52.6) against
Oregon State will get more than

enough competition from USC's
Edesal (larrison (46.7 season best
and lifetime mark of 45.5).
Perhaps the closest race will be
in the high hurdles, where Rick
Tipton (13.7 season mark) will be
challenged by USC's fine young
hurdler Lance Babb who arose
from comparative obscurity to
establish a fine 13.9 season mark.
