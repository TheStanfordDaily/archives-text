Duvalier Dies
PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti - The era of Francois "Papa
Doc" Duvalier ended in Haiti with his death, and a new one
was launched yesterday by his teen-age son.
"I have decided to continue his work with the same
fighting energy as my illustrious father," 19-year-old Jean
Claude Duvalier told the nation in his first official speech as
president.
Veterans Arrested
WASHINGTON — A federal-court order banning antiwar
veterans from camping on the Mall was dissolved yesterday
evening after the Justice Department made no attempt to
enforce it.
The development came after 108 Vietnam veterans were
arrested while demonstrating on the steps of the Supreme
Court.
The order, banning camping or sleeping on the Mall, was
rescinded by U.S. Distr. Court Judge George L. Hart Jr.,
who had issued it earlier in the week. The order had been
upheld Wednesday by the Supreme Court.
At the Mall campsite, a few hundred yards from the
Capitol, the former soldiers set up a military-style chow
line, met with congressmen, heard speeches and lounged
under tents the court had said they could not erect.
Park police watched the camp with tacit approval,
despite the court injunction against it. But at the Supreme
Court city policy moved in on the demonstrators after an
hour and a half.
Soviet* T lunch Spaceship
MOSCOW — The Soviet Union sent a spaceship with three
men aboard into orbit early today to conduct "joint
experiments" with a space station launched four days ago.

As usual with the Soviet space program, the
announcement did not disclose how long the Soyuz 10
flight would last or whether the experiment would include
any further launchings.
Soyuz 10 went aloft at 2:54 a.m. Moscow time—7:s4
p.m. EST Thursday—as part of a program that Western
experts and Soviet sources have called a step toward
establishment of a manned orbital station.
