# Reports Differ On Johnson's Case
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
James Johnson, a volatile participant
from the beginning of Stanford's
radical movement, has been charged
with possessing explosives found in a
January raid on a "bomb factory" in
the Santa Cruz Mountains.
But Johnson has been missing since
October, when he went underground in
the face of earlier charges ranging from
possessing explosives in East Palo Alto
to assaulting a policeman.
Now, in spite of complete denials by
local officials, San Francisco Examiner
reporter Ed Montgomery insists
Johnson is also "strongly suspected" of
setting last year's $100,000 fire at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences.
In the Monday Examiner,
Montgomery, a longtime crime
reporter, wrote that "Santa Clara
County authorities" were told Johnson
set the April 24, 1970, fire by "an
informer from within the
radical-militant faction at Stanford."
But spokesmen for Santa Clara's

sheriff, fire department, and district
attorneyâ€”all the responsible
"authorities"-denied there was any
evidence to link Johnson with tne
Stanford arson.
Several Stanford activists (who
refused to be identified, citing fear of
"police harassment") said the charges
were part of a "fishing expedition" to
blame Johnson for "every unsolvable
crime in the world." And they called
Montgomery's story a "police plant."
Montgomery stuck by his story,
however. "Let them deny it,"he said
of police authorities. He said officials at
first denied Angela Davis' gun-buying
charges, "when I broke that story."
Sgt. Donald Tamm of the Santa
Clara County Sheriffs office said
Johnson is definitely "not wanted" by
his department for the fire. And a
Stanford police source said Santa Clara
fire marshalls were "quite disturbed"
by Montgomery's allegation. Stanford
Police Chief Thomas Bell said that
investigation of the big fire, which
damaged papers of at least ten scholars,
had come to a "dead end" with no
suspects.

Beyond the alleged campus
"informer," Montgomery told the
Daily that officials linked Johnson to
the fire through two gasoline-filled
"orange soda bottles" found on the
scene. But official sources said the
bottles provided no fingerprints or
other direct evidence in the case.
Several police agencies indicated
Montgomery probably got his story
from friends in the California
Identification and Investigation bureau.
A policeman called the CII a "secretive,
undercover" division of the State
Department of Justice.
Montgomery denied he had talked
to the CII, except as a secondary
source. Agent Foster ir. San
Francisco CII office admitted the
organization was investigating the Santa
Cruz bomb cache but would say no
more.
While public allegations of any
suspicions of Johnson in the Stanford
fire rest solely on Montgomery's
insistent reports, formal charges have
been pressed for possessing the
explosives found at two remote cabins
in the Santa Cruz Mountains.
Santa Cruz Lieutenant Marv
Gangloff said there are "a lot of things"
linking Johnson to 149 sticks of
dynamite, nitroglycerin, fuses, and
other devices.
But he said there was no evidence
Johnson was involved in the murder of
Black Panther Fred Bennett, whose
burned and mutilated body was found
near the Santa Cruz cabins.
Santa Cruz officials denied
Montgomery's information on the
"bomb factory" case. The reporter
wrote that police had evidence the
cabins were the source of bombs
"planted in Oakland and Palo Alto

which failed to explode." And he told
the Daily that police are seeking a
former Stanford student who was
"buddy-buddy" with Johnson.
Montgomery's article called Johnson
a "27-year-old electronics-explosive
expert" and a "black militant
electronics genius." Although Johnson
studied chemical engineering at
Stanford, sources on campus insisted he
had never been known as an
"electronics genius."
However, Johnson was arrested May
13, 1970, on charges of possessing
explosive components in an East Palo
Alto house which he shared with
Leonard Siegel and other activists.
