# Earth Action Day
## 
### BOB BACON 
"Practice what you preach; stop talking and start doing"
was the message of eight Earth Day speakers in White Plaza
yesterday.
But there was no agreement on the specific steps to be
taken to preserve the natural environment. Proposals
included a concerted effort for Congressman "Pete"
McCloskey's Presidential campaign, a national economic
boycott, and Stanford's new Ecology House.
Biology professor Paul Ehrlich, principal speaker of the
day, highly praised McCloskey, whose election, he
suggested, would help to turn America away from the
violent orientation of the Nixon administration. The way
to end violence is not through violence, he stated;
"concerted political activity" on behalf of candidates such
as McCloskey is the best way to achieve necessary changes.
On a more ecological note, Ehrlich condemned
American bombing of Indochina as "ecocide; a uniquely
American atrocity." He attacked Nixon for his "lack of
concern for human life," and said that "in order to save the
earth, we must change the ways we deal with people."
In contrast to last year's large crowds, less than 200
heard Ehrlich's opening remarks, and they had dwindled to
a handful by the conclusion of the hour-long program.
