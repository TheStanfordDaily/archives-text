# Anti-War Groups Plan Peace Demonstration
##

Concerned citizens protesting the
war in. Southeast Asia are expected to
converge on San Francisco and
Washington tomorrow in an effort to
demonstrate massive support for
immediate withdrawal of American
troops from Indochina.
It is believed that a large number of
Stanford students, faculty and staff will
travel to San Francisco tomorrow to
participate in the West Coast portion of
the protest march.
March organizers predict a turnout
that will exceed that of the November,
1969 Moratorium. The demonstration
is being sponsored by a wide coalition
of political figures, G.I. and veteran
groups, minority groups, civic and labor
leaders, womens' organizations,
clergymen, and members of the
nation's academic communities.

The San Francisco march will begin
at 9:00 a.m. at the corner of California
and Market Streets, and proceed down
Post Street and Geary Boulevard,
culminating in a rally at the Polo Fields
in Golden Gate Park at 2 p.m.
Buses will leave Stanford for San

Francisco at 7:30 a.m. and 10 a.m.
There are a few tickets available for the
7:30 bus, and considerably more
