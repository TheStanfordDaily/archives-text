At least four shots were fired
late last night at the Pacific Gas &
Electric Power Transformer
Compound near the women's tennis
courts.
Two transformers were
penetrated by the bullets, causing
oil to leak from the apparatus.
Stanford police and fire units,
informed of the shooting by a
student near the scene, stopped the
leakage completely about an hour
later. The compound, equipped with
6 0-kilovolt transformers, is the
central power source for the
campus.
According to Stanford Assistant
Fire Chief John Barr, if enough oil
had been allowed to leak away, the
temperature in the transformers
could have risen dangerously,
eventually causing an "arc of
electric current" to burst out with
the force of a mild explosion.
