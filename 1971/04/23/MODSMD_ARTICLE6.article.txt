# Med School Controversy
## Negotiations Stalled 
### 
A fairly substantial stalemate arose
yesterday over the composition of
negotiating teams between Stanford
Medical Center officials and
representatives of Black and Latin
Hospital workers.
While the Hospital officials were
prepared to enter into negotiations to
further clarify and discuss the
Hospital's Monday morning responses
to 11 minority demands, worker
representatives insisted on determining
the composition of their negotiating
teams.
Acting Dean Dr. John L. Wilson of
the Medical Center, said Wednesday
that talks would take place between
"administration and employees
accompanied by their legal advisors."
Worker representatives reject that rigid
definition of their negotiating team.
In response to the administration
position, Tony Rodriguez, Director of
Latin Resources at the Hospital and
leader of the Alianza Latina, accused
Dean Wilson and Dr. Thomas A. Gonda,
Director of Stanford Hospital, of being
"paternalistic," and "creating a climate
for which they must bear
responsibility."
'We Are Ready'
"We are ready at any moment to
begin negotiations as soon as the
administration stops trying to tell us
who we can have on our negotiating
teams," Rodriguez said in a written
statement.
"They have at their fingertips
immense resources and yet are trying to
limit our group to just workers who
obviously lack the expertise to play the
administration's sophisticated game,"
he continued in his statement.
"We have gone out and found the
very best help available and we refuse

to permit the administration to tell us
who we can have to assist us. Their
intractability and paternalism are
creating a climate for which Dean
Wilson and Dr. Gonda must bear
responsibility," he declared.
No Immediate Reaction
There was no immediate reaction
from the Hospital administration to
Rodriguez' statement nor to the newly
arisen deadlock between the two
parties.
Hospital functions were reported
"normal" yesterday. A continuation of
Tuesday's partial sick-in failed to
materialize for a second day. The
Hospital did not report any slowdown
or unusual number of sick leaves.
About 20 persons, allegedly
members of United Stanford
Employees (USE), distributed flyers
early yesterday morning outside the
Medical Center.
The leaflets called for a noon rally
on the Med School lawn in support of
Black and Latin demands. There was a
disappointing turnout; however, only
40 people showed up, few of them
Hospital workers.
