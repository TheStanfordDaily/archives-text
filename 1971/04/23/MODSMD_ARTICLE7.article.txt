# Law Students At Draft Protest
## 
### 
Twelve Stanford law students and
one student from the School of
Medicine were cited yesterday by San
Jose police for blocking the entrance to
a local draft board.
The 13 were then released by police
on the scene. Their blocking of the
draft board followed an earlier
picketing of the San Jose office of
Household Finance Corporation (HFC).
They charged that the loan corporation
is involved in the war through the
activities of a subsidiary, Seely-King
Thermos Company, which
manufactures antipersonnel
fragmentation bombs used in Vietnam.

What can you say about a
demonstration that died? That it was
beautiful? That it seemed pointless?
That on a scale of 10, it rated a five?
The demonstration began slowly
yesterday morning with a small picket
line outside the San Jose office of
Household Finance Company ("Never
borrow money needlessly .. ."). They
were protesting HFC's complicity in
the war effort. Apparently an HFC
subsidiary, the King-Seely Thermos
Company, manufactures antipersonnel
fragmentation bombs. Still, it was an
issue without glamour. The earnest law
students would approach the San Jose
pedestrians, asking them "Are you
aware of HFC's involvement with the
war effort?" Most of them didn't
know; few really seemed to care.
After an hour of street life, San Jose
style, the media began to arrive. First
to show was a reporter for KCBS radio
news. Another radio news reporter
came and went in short order. The law

students hit the big time about 11:30
a.m. when KTVU television news sent a
camera crew around to check out th«
action.
By this time, the group had swelled
to 30, and individual protestors were
preparing to slip away in the direction
of the draft board offices, four blocks
away. In a strange mixture of righteous
revolutionary action and
grammar-school cops and robbers, they
split into groups of two or three, to
meet again at the coffee shop next to
the draft board.
Their arrival at the coffee shop was
no surprise. Two plainclothes San Jose
policemen were waiting as the neatly
dressed young men and the realistically
dressed young women walked in,
bought some yogurt or a pack of
potato chips, and sat down quietly. By
12:30 p.m., a dozen demonstrators
were sitting quietly in the coffee shop,
looking rather out of place amid the
office workers filling their lunch breaks
with hearts, bridge, or conversation.
Shortly afterwards, a larger group of
students, holding fresh daisies, emerged
from the elevators and filled the hall
outside the draft board offices. They
linked arms, posed for pictures, and
looked peace-loving.
No Violence
The policeman in charge, division
chief Donald Ross, asked if there was a
spokesman, "We don't want violence
and you don't want violence," he said.
"If you have a statement to read, read
it and then we'll arrest you."
The statement was duly read.
Pictures were snapped by various
photographers. A few supporters
applauded, while some of the office
workers from next door stared,
wondering just what was going on.
Then Chief Ross produced the
manager of the draft board. "This is the
manager of the draft board." he
informed the 13 protestors. "She'll ask
you to leave." She asked them to leave.
Then Ross produced the building
manager, who went through the same
catechism. The demonstrators were
given another warning, then the
moment of truth arrived, and one of
the policeman on the scene announced
that "You are under arrest for violation

to a close. Mrs. Robert McAfee Brown,
whose husband was arrested on Good
Friday at a Berkeley draft board,
summed up the entire story: "It's hard

beaches of Danang, the art of
demonstration and protest is growing as
stale as the interventions that came
before.

Pictures were snapped by various

Twelve Stanford law students and
one student from the School of
Medicine were cited yesterday by San
Jose police for blocking the entrance to
a local draft board.
The 13 were then released by police
on the scene. Their blocking of the
draft board followed an earlier
picketing of the San Jose office of
Household Finance Corporation (HFC).
They charged that the loan corporation
is involved in the war through the
activities of a subsidiary, Seely-King
Thermos Company, which
manufactures antipersonnel
fragmentation bombs used in Vietnam.

What can you say about a
demonstration that died? That it was
beautiful? That it seemed pointless?
That on a scale of 10, it rated a five?
The demonstration began slowly
yesterday morning with a small picket
line outside the San Jose office of
Household Finance Company ("Never
borrow money needlessly .. ."). They
were protesting HFC's complicity in
the war effort. Apparently an HFC
subsidiary, the King-Seely Thermos
Company, manufactures antipersonnel
fragmentation bombs. Still, it was an
issue without glamour. The earnest law
students would approach the San Jose
pedestrians, asking them "Are you
aware of HFC's involvement with the
war effort?" Most of them didn't
know; few really seemed to care.
After an hour of street life, San Jose
style, the media began to arrive. First
to show was a reporter for KCBS radio
news. Another radio news reporter
came and went in short order. The law

students hit the big time about 11:30
a.m. when KTVU television news sent a
camera crew around to check out th«
action.
By this time, the group had swelled
to 30, and individual protestors were
preparing to slip away in the direction
of the draft board offices, four blocks
away. In a strange mixture of righteous
revolutionary action and
grammar-school cops and robbers, they
split into groups of two or three, to
meet again at the coffee shop next to
the draft board.
Their arrival at the coffee shop was
no surprise. Two plainclothes San Jose
policemen were waiting as the neatly
dressed young men and the realistically
dressed young women walked in,
bought some yogurt or a pack of
potato chips, and sat down quietly. By
12:30 p.m., a dozen demonstrators
were sitting quietly in the coffee shop,
looking rather out of place amid the
office workers filling their lunch breaks
with hearts, bridge, or conversation.
Shortly afterwards, a larger group of
students, holding fresh daisies, emerged
from the elevators and filled the hall
outside the draft board offices. They
linked arms, posed for pictures, and
looked peace-loving.
