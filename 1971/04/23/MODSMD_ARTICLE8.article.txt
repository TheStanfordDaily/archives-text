# anti-war, anti-draft
## March On San Francisco 
### 
Despite all the guarantees, assurances, and
promises, Richard Nixon has made only one thing
perfectly clear- that he has no intentions of
significantly winding down the war and will
continue to prop up the oppressive and corrupt
Thieu-Ky regime. As the war continues to expand
into Laos and Cambodia, and U.S. air power and
artillery pick up the slack left by limited troop
withdrawals, Nixon's lies are exposed by the harsh
realities of continued battle deaths and the horrible
devastation of the peoples and land of Southeast
Asia.
The responsibility of the antiwar movement is
that of a catalyst—to convert the mass sentiment
against the war, which is now nearing the boiling
point, into massive, peaceful, legal action around
the demands for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all U.S. troops and materiel from
Southeast Asia, and the abolition of the draft. It
will take a broad, organized mobilization of the
American people to accomplish this and to prevent
the U.S. government from continuing its policy of
destroying Southeast Asia in order to "save it." And
it is precisely for this reason that April 24 has been
designated as a National Moratorium day by the
National Peace Action Coalition.
On April 24 groups from all over the country will
assemble in San Francisco and Washington D.C. in
opposition to the war and the draft. The march has
been endorsed by many government officials
(including Sen. Muskie, Sen. McGovern, Sen.
Hartke, and Rep. Julian Bond), civil rights leaders,
church groups, and labor and business leaders. In
San Francisco, the general assembly area will be at

ken yale

Embarcadero Plaza, Market at California, between
8:00 and 9:00 a.m. This march will then proceed to
the Polo Field in Golden Gate Park, where it will be
joined by black, chicano, Asian, native American,
women, and G.I. contingents.
Admittedly, even the broad and massive
mobilization of the American people on April 24 in
itself will probably not achieve our goals. We
recognize that we are facing an administration
which has become insensitive to the needs of most
of the world's people. As a result, ending the war
and the draft will not be accomplished by any single
action alone, but rather through a continuous
struggle. However, this march is a large and
important element in the struggle. Without such
independent mass action, Nixon can continue
indefinitely to talk about "peace" while continuing
the aggression.
In the recent ASSU elections, Stanford passed
the People's Peace Treaty which concluded with the
following vow: "By ratifying the agreement, we
pledge to take whatever actions are appropriate to
implement the terms of this joint Treaty and to
insure its acceptance by the government of the
United States." We call upon the Stanford
community to fulfill its pledge by joining with
hundreds of thousands of American people on April
24 to produce a broad and powerful response to
Nixon's continuing prosecution of the war and the
draft.
Join us!!! U.S. out of Southeast Asia now!!! End
the draft now!!!

church groups, and labor and business leaders. In
San Francisco, the general assembly area will be at

ken yale

Embarcadero Plaza, Market at California, between
8:00 and 9:00 a.m. This march will then proceed to
the Polo Field in Golden Gate Park, where it will be
joined by black, chicano, Asian, native American,
women, and G.I. contingents.
Admittedly, even the broad and massive
mobilization of the American people on April 24 in
itself will probably not achieve our goals. We
recognize that we are facing an administration
which has become insensitive to the needs of most
of the world's people. As a result, ending the war
and the draft will not be accomplished by any single
action alone, but rather through a continuous
struggle. However, this march is a large and
important element in the struggle. Without such
independent mass action, Nixon can continue
indefinitely to talk about "peace" while continuing
the aggression.
In the recent ASSU elections, Stanford passed
the People's Peace Treaty which concluded with the
following vow: "By ratifying the agreement, we
pledge to take whatever actions are appropriate to
implement the terms of this joint Treaty and to
insure its acceptance by the government of the
United States." We call upon the Stanford
community to fulfill its pledge by joining with
hundreds of thousands of American people on April
24 to produce a broad and powerful response to
Nixon's continuing prosecution of the war and the
draft.
Join us!!! U.S. out of Southeast Asia now!!! End
the draft now!!!
(Ken Yale is one of the Stanford coordinators of
tomorrow's March)
Despite all the guarantees, assurances, and
promises, Richard Nixon has made only one thing
perfectly clear- that he has no intentions of
significantly winding down the war and will
continue to prop up the oppressive and corrupt
Thieu-Ky regime. As the war continues to expand
into Laos and Cambodia, and U.S. air power and
artillery pick up the slack left by limited troop
withdrawals, Nixon's lies are exposed by the harsh
realities of continued battle deaths and the horrible
devastation of the peoples and land of Southeast
Asia.
The responsibility of the antiwar movement is
that of a catalyst—to convert the mass sentiment
against the war, which is now nearing the boiling
point, into massive, peaceful, legal action around
the demands for an immediate and unconditional
withdrawal of all U.S. troops and materiel from
Southeast Asia, and the abolition of the draft. It
will take a broad, organized mobilization of the
American people to accomplish this and to prevent
the U.S. government from continuing its policy of
destroying Southeast Asia in order to "save it." And
it is precisely for this reason that April 24 has been
designated as a National Moratorium day by the
National Peace Action Coalition.
On April 24 groups from all over the country will
assemble in San Francisco and Washington D.C. in
opposition to the war and the draft. The march has
been endorsed by many government officials
(including Sen. Muskie, Sen. McGovern, Sen.
Hartke, and Rep. Julian Bond), civil rights leaders,
church groups, and labor and business leaders. In
San Francisco, the general assembly area will be at
