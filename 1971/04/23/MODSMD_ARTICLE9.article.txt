## U.S. Role In East Pakistan Genocide 
### 
*Bangladesh committee

Since March 25, hundreds of
thousands of East Pakistanis have
been killed, including women and
children. The United States has
been a major source of military'
and economic aid to Pakistan
since 1951, and this aid is now
being used in the central govern
ment's repressive actions in the
East. It is reported that even cargo
planes recently sent by the U.S. to
aid in the relief of East Pakistani
cyclone victims are being used to
transport soldiers and military
supplies. Before the American
government finds itself involved
again in an Asian civil war, the
American people need to learn the
basic facts of the situation.
The Tragedy of East Pakistan
Since 1917, the majority of the
people of Pakistan (75 million
Bengalis living in East Pakistan)
have been systematically ruled
and exploited by the minority (55
million West Pakistanis). This
exploitation has been economic,
political, social, cultural and
psychological. While the East
Pakistanis earn a large portion of
the country's foreign exchange
("as much as 80 or 90 percent in
the early years"â€”New York
Times, March 27, 1971), "four
times as much foreign aid is spent
in the West, three times as many
imports are consumed there, twice
as much development money is
allocated there" (ibid.).
While the Bengalis of East

Pakistan earn "on the average
only half as much as their Western
countrymen, the price of wheat
and rice is twice as high in the
East as in the West" (ibid.). More
than 90 percent of the Pakistani
army and all senior military
members of the administration
and about 87 percent of the
senior officers in the Central civil
services have been from West
Pakistan. "Since 1951 Pakistan
has been a major recipient of U.S.
economic aid amounting to
approximately $3 billion by 1969.
"The bulk of this assistance has
been used to support
industrialization in West Pakistan
with only a handful of projects
undertaken in East Pakistan"
(Report written by three Harvard
University professors- Edward S.
Mason, Robert Dorfman and
Stephen A. Marglin, April 1971).
The discontent in East Pakistan
which has been growing
throughout the years reached a
climax when the West Pakistan
Government denied the rights of
East Pakistani leader Sheikh
Mujibur Rahman (whose party
Awami League won 167 of the
region's 169 seats and an overall
majority in the combined nation's
313-seat assembly chamber) to
form the government of Pakistan.
The brutal atrocities
perpetrated by the West Pakistan
army include the blasting down of
dormitories at the Dacca

University where tank tracks led
to the walls of the compound
(Times of London, April 2, 1971),
the burning of students of Dacca
University who were hastily
buried in a mass grave (Times of
London, March 30, 1971), the
firing of bazookas into the Dacca
Medical College Hospital (ibid.),
and the burning to the ground of
the office, the popular Bengali
language daily newspaper with 40
journalists inside (New York
Times, March 30, 1971).
The West Pakistani army has
sought and killed students,
intellectuals, professors, engineers,
doctors and others of leadership
caliber (New York Times April
14, 1971). The heads of
departments of Philosophy,
Political Science, English,
Statistics, Physics and History and
the Director of the Bangla
Academy were shot to death. "In
the apartments of the faculty
staff, children were seen shot dead
in their beds. The dead bodies of
what appeared to be the entire
family of a senior professor were
found in another apartment. .
.The conclusion drawn was that
East Pakistan would be without
political and intellectual
leadership for at least a decade,
and perhaps a generation" (Times
of London, April 2, 1971). All
this clearly constitutes an act of
genocide against the

freedom-loving people of Bangla
Desh.
"The quantum of U.S. military
aid to Pakistan is a classified
figure but two estimates put it
between $1.5 to $2 billion for the
period between 1954 to 1965.
The assistance has included F-104
Starfighters, Patton tanks,
armoured personnel carriers,
automatic and recoilless infantry
weapons.
This impressive array of
modern weaponry was given
expressively for defensive
purposes. With Pakistan an early
member of SEATO and CENTO
this military aid was intended to
bolster the armed containment of
the Communist Bloc in the Dulles
era of U.S. foreign policy but
apart form the brief border war
with India of 1965 the only active
use of these sophisticated
weapons has occured against the
unarmed and defenseless civilian
population of East Pakistan.
The growth and maintenance
of the superstructure of the armed
forces which was built up with
massive U.S. military aid
continued even after 1965 when
the United States decided to put
an embargo on the delivery of
arms to both Pakistan and India.
This was possible by diverting
resources from Ihe much needed
development projects. East
Pakistan, poorer and less powerful
politically than the West, suffered
more by this irrational policy.
Surprisingly, the United States
has just recently (October 1970)
made an exception to its embargo
on military sales to Pakistan.
According to the information
available, the United States has
offered to supply Pakistan the
following items:
a. Armored personnel carriers
(approximately 300)
b. Maritime reconnaissance
aircraft (4)
c. F-104 jet fighters(6)
d. B-57 bombers (7)
Fortunately, no sales or
deliveries have yet been made. It
is not too late to rescind the offer,
a move that would be of practical
as well as symbolic value." (From
the paper written by Harvard
professors mentioned above)
However, very recently Robert
J. McCloskey, the State
Department spokesman disclosed
in response to questions that sales
of military items to
Pakistan- both on commercial and
on credit terms- had in fact been
running at "just under $10 million
a year." (New York Times, April
14, 1971). Thus, "Washington's
pretense of non-intervention in
Pakistan's tragic internal conflict
has been shattered this week by
State Department
acknowledgement that the United
States has been selling
ammunition and other 'nonlethal'
military 7 equipment to the
repressive Pakistani government
and by the Administration's
persisting refusal to impose a ban
on such sales.
As long as these sales continue,
the United States places itself
alongside China on the side of the
military regime in Islamabad and
in effect, makes itself a party to
the continuing slaughter of
Pakistan's Bengali majority and to
the suppression of the recently
elected majority party in
Pakistan's still unconvened
National Assembly." (Editorial of
New York Times April 15, 1971)
(The Bangladesh Committee is a
gt'oup of Pakistanies on campus.)
