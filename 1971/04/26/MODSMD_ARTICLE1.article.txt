# 150,000 Jam Polo Field
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Marching behind thousands of
colorful banners and flags, a diverse
coalition of between 150,000 and
200,000 peace demonstrators filled the
San Francisco Polo Grounds Saturday
calling for an end to the war in
Vietnam.
At one point, KCBS radio reported
the line of protestors stretched ten
abreast across almost the entire city,
from the starting point on the
Embarcadero to the Polo Field, a
distance of seven miles.
The march and demonstration
remained almost entirely peaceful,
although late in the afternoon Chicano
militants overran the stage and caused
the cancellation of several speakers
including Rep Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey and draft-resistance leader
David Harris.
Although the crowd was mostly
young and mostly white, all types of
persons joined the march, from babies
in strollers to businessmen in suits. The
banners identifying various groups
proclaimed a diversity unprecedented
in anti-war protests.
Signs marked the presence of
organized labor, womens liberationists
third world contingents, veterans, Gl's,
socialists, communists, businessmen,
scientists, gays, anti-imperialists,
conservationists, and numerous other
groups.
More Than One Cause
Many groups tried to tie the war
protest with their own cause. One black

carried a sign, "No Vietnamese ever
called me nigger." Paul Schrade,
western regional director of the United
Auto Workers, told the crowd "the
Indochina war is a labor problem."
Women's liberationists complained of
the "male machisimo" inspired by the
war.
Hundreds of flags waved in the cool
breeze. Those of the U.S. were
prominent, but clearly outnumbered by
the red, blue and yellow banners of the
National Liberation Front. Peace
symbols appeared throughout along
with many elaborate signs calling for
simply "Peace Now." Said one sign
"The majority isn't silent, the
government is deaf."
Chants ranged from "Peace Now"
by the more moderate segments of the
march, to "one side's right, one side's
wrong - victory to the Viet Cong," by
the radicals.
White Arm-bands
Monitors wearing white arm-bands
seemed to have no trouble controlling
the marching throng.
Working closely with police in
stopping the march at corners to allow
traffic to pass, they prevented any
major traffic problems.
Speakers at the demonstration
reflected the diversity of the crowd,
including an eleven-year-old, Adam
Feerst; labor leader Schrade; and
comedian Dick Gregory.
Drawing the greatest applause was a
pledge by Gregory to fast (except for
liquids) until the war is over. Later war
veterans drew a standing ovation when
they threw away a flurry of Vietnam
medals.
'Sea Of Green'
Also appearing were Warren
"Videner, mayor-elect of Berkeley; rock

group Big Brother and the Holding
Company; and John Burton, California
State Assemblyman.
Burton led a collection to pay off
the sponsoring National Peace Action
Coalition's $35,000 debt. He asked
every one to "dig in your pockets" for a
"sea of green' which monitors
collected. Burton's plea was met with
obscenities from a large segment of the
crowd.
Later Abe Tapia, president of the
Mexican-American Political
Association, told the crowd Third
World peoples are tired of whites "like
Assemblyman Burton asking poor
people for money."
'Peace! Peace! Peace!'
Shortly after Tapia during a series of
Chicano speeches David Sanchez, prime
minister of the Brown Berets, called for
a violent revolution, but was shouted
down by grouj.s close to the stage
chanting "Peace! Peace! Peace!
The biggest spectacle, however, was
not on stage, but was the crowd itself.
Many of those present paid little
attention to the blaring speakers,
preferring to wander and talk with
those around them. Most seemed
unaware of the trouble at the speakers'
platform. At one point hundreds of
yellow and blue plastic can lids thrown
like frisbees filled the air.
The atmosphere became
progressively less atuned to the war
throughout the afternoon as people
grew bored with the speeches and
money collection. Wine jugs were
passed around and marijuana smoked
openly throughout the crowd. People
began drifting away about 3 p.m., and
about half of the crowd was gone when
the sound system was abruptly shut off
an hour later.

calling for an end to the war in
Vietnam.
At one point, KCBS radio reported
the line of protestors stretched ten
abreast across almost the entire city,
from the starting point on the
Embarcadero to the Polo Field, a
distance of seven miles.
The march and demonstration
remained almost entirely peaceful,
although late in the afternoon Chicano
militants overran the stage and caused
the cancellation of several speakers
including Rep Paul N. "Pete"
McCloskey and draft-resistance leader
David Harris.
Although the crowd was mostly
young and mostly white, all types of
persons joined the march, from babies
in strollers to businessmen in suits. The
banners identifying various groups
proclaimed a diversity unprecedented
in anti-war protests.
Signs marked the presence of
organized labor, womens liberationists
third world contingents, veterans, Gl's,
socialists, communists, businessmen,
scientists, gays, anti-imperialists,
conservationists, and numerous other
groups.
More Than One Cause
Many groups tried to tie the war
protest with their own cause. One black

carried a sign, "No Vietnamese ever
called me nigger." Paul Schrade,
western regional director of the United
Auto Workers, told the crowd "the
Indochina war is a labor problem."
Women's liberationists complained of
the "male machisimo" inspired by the
war.
Hundreds of flags waved in the cool
breeze. Those of the U.S. were
prominent, but clearly outnumbered by
the red, blue and yellow banners of the
National Liberation Front. Peace
symbols appeared throughout along
with many elaborate signs calling for
simply "Peace Now." Said one sign
"The majority isn't silent, the
government is deaf."
Chants ranged from "Peace Now"
by the more moderate segments of the
march, to "one side's right, one side's
wrong - victory to the Viet Cong," by
the radicals.
White Arm-bands
Monitors wearing white arm-bands
seemed to have no trouble controlling
the marching throng.
Working closely with police in
stopping the march at corners to allow
traffic to pass, they prevented any
major traffic problems.
Speakers at the demonstration
reflected the diversity of the crowd,
including an eleven-year-old, Adam
Feerst; labor leader Schrade; and
comedian Dick Gregory.
Drawing the greatest applause was a
pledge by Gregory to fast (except for
liquids) until the war is over. Later war
veterans drew a standing ovation when
they threw away a flurry of Vietnam
medals.
'Sea Of Green'
Also appearing were Warren
"Videner, mayor-elect of Berkeley; rock

group Big Brother and the Holding
Company; and John Burton, California
State Assemblyman.
Burton led a collection to pay off
the sponsoring National Peace Action
Coalition's $35,000 debt. He asked
every one to "dig in your pockets" for a
"sea of green' which monitors
collected. Burton's plea was met with
obscenities from a large segment of the
crowd.
Later Abe Tapia, president of the
Mexican-American Political
Association, told the crowd Third
World peoples are tired of whites "like
Assemblyman Burton asking poor
people for money."
'Peace! Peace! Peace!'
Shortly after Tapia during a series of
Chicano speeches David Sanchez, prime
minister of the Brown Berets, called for
a violent revolution, but was shouted
down by grouj.s close to the stage
chanting "Peace! Peace! Peace!
The biggest spectacle, however, was
not on stage, but was the crowd itself.
Many of those present paid little
attention to the blaring speakers,
preferring to wander and talk with
those around them. Most seemed
unaware of the trouble at the speakers'
platform. At one point hundreds of
yellow and blue plastic can lids thrown
like frisbees filled the air.
The atmosphere became
progressively less atuned to the war
throughout the afternoon as people
grew bored with the speeches and
money collection. Wine jugs were
passed around and marijuana smoked
openly throughout the crowd. People
began drifting away about 3 p.m., and
about half of the crowd was gone when
the sound system was abruptly shut off
an hour later.
