# Premieres Mark Film Week
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Twopremieres mark the coming
Stanford film week, as well as a
porno classic, a Hitchcock, a
Huston and personal appearances
by a leading film critic and a
legendary Hollywood director.
On TUESDAY starting at 7:30
p.m. Clive Miller will show Busby
Berkeley's "Babes in Arms," a
Rodgers and Hart musical that
became one of Judy Garland and
Mickey Rooney's better vehicles.
Also on the bill is a first-rate
Warner Brothers swashbuckler
"The Sea Hawk" starring Errol
Flynn and Claude Rains, in Geo
320.
TUESDAY night will also mark
the world premiere of what has
been dubbed "the first audience
participation film." It's called
"Come to Your Senses," deals
ostensibly with sensory awakening
and relaxation and comes to us
from Bernard Gunther through
Lee Mendelson's Burlingame
studios. At 8:00 p.m. in Mem
Aud.
Though Russ Meyer's "Vixen"
can't begin to compare with
today's stag films in what is
graphically depicted, it far
surpasses hard-core items in the
exuberance and fun with which
it tackles sex as a subject. Meyer

has always had a penchant for
buxom broads of stupefying
proportions and nowhere are they
on view more pleasantly than in
this 1969 production whichwill be
shown WEDNESDAY at 8:00
p.m. in Mem Aud.
Arthur Knight, critic for
Saturday Review and co-author of
Playboy's "Sex in the Cinema"
series, will introduce the film.
This week's International
Association Film is Satyajit Ray's
"Tagore," a biographical
documentary on India's
poet-philosopher. On
THURSDAY in Cubberly.
A biographical documentary of
apparently a very different sort is
"The American Dreamer," which
premieres in Mem Aud at 7 :30 and
10:00 on THURSDAY. Judging
from descriptions, the film is
essentially a contemporary
monologue by Dennis Hopper,
with the action consisting of
Hopper having sex, walking
around nude and editing his
forthcoming "The Las Movie."
Obviously another youth
market item, but whether it's
more honest than most I don't
know. The distributors seem to
have confidence in its relevancy,
for they're releasing it directly on

the college circuit, avoiding
first-run situations.
"Beat the Devil" has suffered
from television's shears more that
any other film I know and should
therefore be seen in a theater if
it's to be seen at all. Humphrey
Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina
Lollobrigida, Robert Morley and
Peter Lorre appear in this haywire
comedy by John Huston and
Truman Capote, to be shown at
Tresidder on FRIDAY at 7:00,
8:00 and 9:00.
Occupying Cubberly on
SATURDAY at 7:30 and 10:00
will be Alfred Hitchcock's
"Spellbound." The combination
of Gregory Peck and Ingrid
Bergman never quite makes it and
though this is not one of the
director's better efforts, a dream
sequence designed by Salvador
Dali is some compensation.
Appearing in person at 7:30 on
SATURDAY in Bishop will be
Hollywood director King Vidor.
Now 76 years old, Vidor will
discuss his career as a film maker,
which began in 1913, show clips
from his silent, "The Big Parade"
and his color spectacular, "War
and Peace," and present in its
entirety his 1928 classic, "The
Crowd." Vidor's career having
encompassed almost the entire
span of commercial film making
in America, the evening should be
highly interesting.

Playboy's "Sex in the Cinema"
series, will introduce the film.
This week's International
Association Film is Satyajit Ray's
"Tagore," a biographical
documentary on India's
poet-philosopher. On
THURSDAY in Cubberly.
A biographical documentary of
apparently a very different sort is
"The American Dreamer," which
premieres in Mem Aud at 7 :30 and
10:00 on THURSDAY. Judging
from descriptions, the film is
essentially a contemporary
monologue by Dennis Hopper,
with the action consisting of
Hopper having sex, walking
around nude and editing his
forthcoming "The Las Movie."
Obviously another youth
market item, but whether it's
more honest than most I don't
know. The distributors seem to
have confidence in its relevancy,
for they're releasing it directly on

the college circuit, avoiding
first-run situations.
"Beat the Devil" has suffered
from television's shears more that
any other film I know and should
therefore be seen in a theater if
it's to be seen at all. Humphrey
Bogart, Jennifer Jones, Gina
Lollobrigida, Robert Morley and
Peter Lorre appear in this haywire
comedy by John Huston and
Truman Capote, to be shown at
Tresidder on FRIDAY at 7:00,
8:00 and 9:00.
Occupying Cubberly on
SATURDAY at 7:30 and 10:00
will be Alfred Hitchcock's
"Spellbound." The combination
of Gregory Peck and Ingrid
Bergman never quite makes it and
though this is not one of the
director's better efforts, a dream
sequence designed by Salvador
Dali is some compensation.
Appearing in person at 7:30 on
SATURDAY in Bishop will be
Hollywood director King Vidor.
Now 76 years old, Vidor will
discuss his career as a film maker,
which began in 1913, show clips
from his silent, "The Big Parade"
and his color spectacular, "War
and Peace," and present in its
entirety his 1928 classic, "The
Crowd." Vidor's career having
encompassed almost the entire
span of commercial film making
in America, the evening should be
highly interesting.
Twopremieres mark the coming
Stanford film week, as well as a
porno classic, a Hitchcock, a
Huston and personal appearances
by a leading film critic and a
legendary Hollywood director.
On TUESDAY starting at 7:30
p.m. Clive Miller will show Busby
Berkeley's "Babes in Arms," a
Rodgers and Hart musical that
became one of Judy Garland and
Mickey Rooney's better vehicles.
Also on the bill is a first-rate
Warner Brothers swashbuckler
"The Sea Hawk" starring Errol
Flynn and Claude Rains, in Geo
320.
TUESDAY night will also mark
the world premiere of what has
been dubbed "the first audience
participation film." It's called
"Come to Your Senses," deals
ostensibly with sensory awakening
and relaxation and comes to us
from Bernard Gunther through
Lee Mendelson's Burlingame
studios. At 8:00 p.m. in Mem
Aud.
Though Russ Meyer's "Vixen"
can't begin to compare with
today's stag films in what is
graphically depicted, it far
surpasses hard-core items in the
exuberance and fun with which
it tackles sex as a subject. Meyer

has always had a penchant for
buxom broads of stupefying
proportions and nowhere are they
on view more pleasantly than in
this 1969 production whichwill be
shown WEDNESDAY at 8:00
p.m. in Mem Aud.
Arthur Knight, critic for
Saturday Review and co-author of
Playboy's "Sex in the Cinema"
series, will introduce the film.
