# Indians' Title Hopes Lifted

### ROB MARKS 
Stanford's chances in the
Southern Division of the Pacific 8
Baseball race improved consider
ably this weekend, as the Indians
re-bounded from a Friday loss to
USC to take a double header from
UCLA on Saturday 3-2 and 2-1.
This gives the team a 3-4
conference log, tied with UCLA
and four games behind USC.
The two wins against UCLA
were especially important, since
they gave the Cards a 2-1 record
against the Bruins, and would
send them to the playoffs in case
of a tie for second place with
UCLA.
On Friday, the Indians lost a
heartbreaker to the defending
national champion Trojans, 2-1, at
the Sunken Diamond. Bruce
Schoen pitched probably his
finest game in four years at
Stanford, allowing only six hits
and two runs. However, his costly
throwing error in the second
inning lead to USC's first run. On
the other hand, Steve "Busby,
USC's winning pitcher, was in
constant trouble after the fifth
inning, but the Indian's were

never able to come up with the
crucial hit to win the game.
Saturday was a different story,
as the Reds swept the Bruins, 2-1
and 3-2. Bob Kammeyer pitched
well in the first game,
surrendering only four hits as he
brought his record to 7-4. The
Indians pushed across single runs
in the second and third innings,
and then held off a last inning
UCLA rally to win.
In the second game, UCLA
rushed out to an early 2-0 lead,
but the Indian's fought back to tie
it in the seventh, and then finally
win it in the ninth on a bases
loaded single with two out by Pat

Rusco. Jim Coate got the win for
Stanford, bringing his record the
year to 2-1.
These three close games are
indicative of the mild hitting
slump the Indians are
experiencing. Over the last six or
seven games, they have often been
unable to come up with the
crucial hit, especially with men on
third base. Coach Ray Young
hopes, however, that these two
big wins "will give the team a lift
and get us going again."
Their record now 29-14, the
batsmen travel to USF for a game
on Tuesday.

and 3-2.
