Southern California brought
their usually talented assortment
of swift sprinters and jumpers,
giant weightmen and strong
distancemen to Stanford Stadium
Saturday and beat the Indian
tracksters 86-58.
To reverse an old cliche, the

score was closer than the meet
would indicate. The Trojans
didn't really put on their finest
effort, but they still won 12 of 17
first places. The Indians could win
only the javelin, intermediate
hurdles, two mile and surprisingly,
the mile relay and the 100 yard
dash.
In the biggest upset, of the
meet, Stanford's Chuck Francis
won the 100 in a wind-hindered
time of 10.0. With a 33 point lead
going into the relay, USC saved its
strength and the Indians won with
a 3:14.6. Don Kardong's 8:47.0 in
the two mile was the only other
real highlight for Stanford.
The outstanding performer of
the meet was USC's Henry Hines
who scored ten points in three
events. He set a meet record in
winning the long jump at 25-7 and
then finished second in the triple
jump (49-0 3/4) and third in the
javelin throw (185-9).
Other fine marks by the
southerners included Doug Lane's
62-2 3/4 toss in the shot put and
Joe Antunovich's 197-10 in the
discus throw. Lance Babb won the
high hurdles in 14.3, a creditable
time considering the wind, but his
victory was diminished by the fact
that Stanford's Rick Tipton was
disqualified for two false starts.
The victory was Southern Cal's
36th straight over Stanford. The
Indians won three straight
non-conference meets to open the
season, but have now lost four in
a row. This Saturday they travel
to Seattle to face the Washington
Huskies.

sophomore Tom Long in the high hurdles with a 14.3 on Saturday.
Stanford star Rick Tipton disqualified in the event, thus preventing
the publicized confrontation with Babb.
