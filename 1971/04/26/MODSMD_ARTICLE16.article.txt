# Today At Alpine Hills
## Cal Tourney Starts 
### HALL DAILY 
Stanford's entire tennis team
seems determined to compete in
this year's 71st California State
Tennis Tournament. Instead of
the lines of battle being drawn
between north and south, this
year will feature the war of the
ages instead.
Top seed Berkeleyite Jim
McManus is joined by Barry
McKay at second seed. The
third-fourth-fifth-sixth seeds are
enough to scare most seasoned
veterans. The top collegians,
seeded in order, are Jeff Borowiak
of UCLA, Tom Leonard of USC,
Stanford's Roscoe Tanner, and
Bob Alloo from Cal Berkeley.
The tourney will be held all
this week starting noon daily at
the Alpine Hills Tennis and
Swimming Club, 4139 Alpine
Road, Portola Valley.
Former winners in the field of
132 are ninth seeded Tom Brown,
a four-time winner, Whitney
Reed, whose four titles came in

1956-7 and 1962-3, last year's
crown-winner Barry McKay, and
this spear's top seed Jim
McManus.
Representing the Indians, led
by Tanner and thirteenth-seed
Alex Mayer, are Rick Fisher, Chris
Chapin, Gery Groslimond, Stan
Pasarell, Rick Evans, Paul Sidone,
Wes Hampton, Tim Noonan, Brian
Hahn, and John Levin.
Other collegiate players
involved in the action this week
are USC's Mike Machette, UCLA's
Modesto Vasquez, and San Jose
State's Carlos Kirmayr.
In the women's competition,
Palo Alto's Eliza Pande is odds-oil
favorite to successfully defend her
Cal State title.
