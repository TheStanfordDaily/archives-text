A powerful bomb explosion in the
attic of the President's offices at 3:50
a.m. last Friday morning tore a jagged
two-foot hole in the second floor
ceiling. The explosion narrowly missed
injuring a campus security policeman
making his rounds.
The policeman, George Curry, 39,
was on the second floor 30 feet away
when the blast occured. Later
investigation revealed that only half the
device had detonated.
No injuries were reported.
Early estimates of the damage were
roughly $25,000.
FBI agents investigating the blast
Friday found a knapsack containing six
Molotov cocktails in an attic across the
Quad from the site of the explosion.
Transformers Punctured
Earlier the same night, a sniper fired
five shots at the Pacific Gas & Electric
substation on Panama St., across from
the woman's tennis courts. Two of the
armor-piercing bullets punctured two
60-kilovolt transformers, causing an oil
leakage.
The leakage was temporarily

stopped by campus police and fire
units. Had it continued, the
temperature in the transformers would
have risen until the electric current
within the transformers burst out with
the force of a small explosion, disabling
the campus's central power source.
Tom Schavland, of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office, told the Palo
Alto Times Friday that officers are
working on the theory that the
bombing and the sniper fire are related.
The early morning explosion,
occun>d some 12 hours after an
anonymous caller had informed Palo
Alto police "a bomb will go off in 30
minutes in the Stanford area." The call
came at 3:35 p.m. Thursday. Schav
land stated that the explosive device
placed on an attic beam was composed
of weighing about 2 1/2 pounds of C-4
plastic explosive. C-4 is designated for
military use and is unavailable
commercially.
According to Scavland, the device
was detonated by an electric,
military-type detonator, and timed by a
Sieko pocket watch. It was wrapped in
a i otton undershirt.
The explosion spent most of its
force in an upward direction, spewing

tiles on the ground on the south side of
the building. About 100 square feet of
tile on the roof were dislodged.
The offices directly above the
first-floor President's offices belong to
James Siena, legal adviser to the
President and John Schwartz Univprsitv

prosecutor. The bomb ripped open the
ceiling of secretarial offices between the
two.
The Molotov cocktails found by the
FBI in one of the interconnecting attics
over the Quad's walkway were
