# Dawn Blast Rips Lyman's Office

### FELICITY BARRINGER DAVE SPECTOR 
A powerful bomb explosion in the
attic of the President's offices at 3:50
a.m. last Friday morning tore a jagged
two-foot hole in the second floor
ceiling. The explosion narrowly missed
injuring a campus security policeman
making his rounds.
The policeman, George Curry, 39,
was on the second floor 30 feet away
when the blast occured. Later
investigation revealed that only half the
device had detonated.
No injuries were reported.
Early estimates of the damage were
roughly $25,000.
FBI agents investigating the blast
Friday found a knapsack containing six
Molotov cocktails in an attic across the
Quad from the site of the explosion.
Transformers Punctured
Earlier the same night, a sniper fired
five shots at the Pacific Gas & Electric
substation on Panama St., across from
the woman's tennis courts. Two of the
armor-piercing bullets punctured two
60-kilovolt transformers, causing an oil
leakage.
The leakage was temporarily

stopped by campus police and fire
units. Had it continued, the
temperature in the transformers would
have risen until the electric current
within the transformers burst out with
the force of a small explosion, disabling
the campus's central power source.
Tom Schavland, of the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's office, told the Palo
Alto Times Friday that officers are
working on the theory that the
bombing and the sniper fire are related.
The early morning explosion,
occun>d some 12 hours after an
anonymous caller had informed Palo
Alto police "a bomb will go off in 30
minutes in the Stanford area." The call
came at 3:35 p.m. Thursday. Schav
land stated that the explosive device
placed on an attic beam was composed
of weighing about 2 1/2 pounds of C-4
plastic explosive. C-4 is designated for
military use and is unavailable
commercially.
According to Scavland, the device
was detonated by an electric,
military-type detonator, and timed by a
Sieko pocket watch. It was wrapped in
a i otton undershirt.
The explosion spent most of its
force in an upward direction, spewing

tiles on the ground on the south side of
the building. About 100 square feet of
tile on the roof were dislodged.
The offices directly above the
first-floor President's offices belong to
James Siena, legal adviser to the
President and John Schwartz Univprsitv

prosecutor. The bomb ripped open the
ceiling of secretarial offices between the
two.
The Molotov cocktails found by the
FBI in one of the interconnecting attics
over the Quad's walkway were
composed of soda bottles filled with
gasoline and stuffed with newspapers
dated April 19 and 20.
FBI agents entered the case under
provisions of the Omnibus Anti-Crime
bill passed by the 91st Congress.
According to this bill, the FBI is
empowered to investigate any damage
or attacks involving explosives at
institutions receiving rederal financial
assistance.
Damage of the PG&E substation was
being repaired over the weekend.
A short time before the bombing
occured, these reporters were on the
Quad investigating the pasting-up of
some revolutionary posters. One of
these posters appeared on the door of
the Daily office just before Friday's
paper left for the printers, sparking
curiosity among those staffers left in
the office.
The poster attacked "Stanford's
toleration of certain working
conditions. In complicity with society's
values, Stanford lias placed the welfare
and life of the Stanford professor above
that of the Stanford worker . . .
"When racism and injustice
permeate the very fabric of the
institution, merely to question the
established order is to rip that fabric
asunder.
They were posted using a wheat
straw type paste, which, if allowed to
dry, is almost permanently binding.
As the reporters headed toward the
Quad, they observed a blue Ford truck
with a temporary plate on the rear
windshield speeding from an area near
Memorial Church past the Engineering
corner and around the Undergraduate
Library. It could not be discerned
whether there was one, or more than
one person in the truck, but the driver
appeared to be a dark-haired male.
Proceeding to Hoover Tower, they
observed no posters on the Tower the
Library Annex, or Memorial

Auditorium. A KZSU reporter Peter
Mauk, joined them as they returned to
the history corner of Quad.
At this corner they spotted a pair of
people, one male and one white female,
standing by the door of the sociology
offices. As they approached the pair,
the pair moved away. Passing the
sociology offices, these reporters
observed a poster identical to the
others around campus pasted on those
doors.
Turning the corner beyond the
sociology offices, the pair was observed
jogging through the area between the
President's offices and the law annex.
The reporters followed, and observed
the female member of their pair drop a
blue scarf in the walkway of Quad near
Building 10.
Mauk stopped to pick up the scarf
and was himself stopped by Curry, the
Stanford policeman making his rounds.
The pair, after jogging through the
collanade between the Main Library
and Cubberly, and walking in front of
the Undergraduate Library-, disappeared
in the vicinity of the Post office.
Returning to the Daily offices,
reporters also observed two black
students, carrying a large bucket and
what appeared to be posters, in the
vicinity of the Mitchell Earch Sciences
building.
Commenting on the bombing Curry,
a black Korean War veteran, said "the
building shook and jarred me pretty
bad. I still have a terrific ringing in my
right ear. My ear feels like it closed up
on me.
Reacting to the bombing, Universlf
President Richard Lyman said,
"Naturally I am angry at this senseless
act. Everything possible is being done
to find out who did it. We need the
cooperation and help of all at Stanford
to bring to an end such harrassing
attacks on the University."
