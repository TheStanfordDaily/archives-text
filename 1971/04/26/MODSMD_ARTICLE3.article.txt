Six years ago today Robert MacNamara, apostle of
cost-benefit analysis and Secretary of Defense, spoke to the
nation about the Vietnamese "conflict." He announced that
American air strikes against the Commies had been effective
although not decisive. And, he reassured middle America, the
war was only costing a measly 1.5 billion dollars a year.
Today, Bob is sadly no longer with the Pentagon; however,
look at the bright side we're still in Vietnam! As Douglas
Mac Arthur used to say, "Old wars never die, they just fade
away."
If you want to hear a good dirty joke about MacNamara call
