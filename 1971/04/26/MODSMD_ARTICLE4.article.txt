# Med Center Increases Minority Council
## 
### 
Stanford University Hospital
announced Saturday that 'effective
immediately' Black and Latin employee
representatives will occupy two
newly-created seats on its
administrative council as part of new
personnel policies effected by the
Hospital.
The two seats on the council will be
occupied by the senior Black staff
member and the senior Latin member
in the Hospital administration.
The announcement came in a
lengthy memorandum to the
Administrative Council and to all
Hospital department heads from Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, Director of the
Hospital.
According to Gonda's statement, the
move was to create "advisory input by
minorities on Hospital matters."
Gonda also announced the creation
of an Employee Advisory Council

(EAC) composed of representative
employees on a Hospital-wide basis
who will have a voice in the
decision-making process.
"Recent events have dramatized the
necessity to obtain more involvement
of employees in the decision-making
process," noted Gonda. A target date
of September 1, 1971 for the
establishment of the KAC was
projected.
Gonda revised the Grievance
Procedure Policy which has been a
source of considerable employee
irratation in the past weeks. "Any
Hospital employee, whether permanent
or probationary, may use the Grievance
Procedure when he has a complaint
relating to his employment," the
statement explained.
The Hospital is "making every
effort" to assure that an employee who
has been on leave of absence is
reinstated to the job originally
occupied. When an employee's leave is
approved, the department head will
note one of the following on the
authorization form, "same position
guaranteed," or "similar position
guaranteed."
Rumors of a long-contemplated
strike at the Medical Center by Black
workers remained largely

unsubstantiated as of last night.
Sources contacted did indicate that
groups met over the weekend and
discussed a possible strike, to begin
today.
A statement released Saturday by
the Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition accused the Hospital
administration of "intransigence" in
the continuing stalemate over
negotiations concerning eleven
minority demands answered last week
by Dr. Gonda.
