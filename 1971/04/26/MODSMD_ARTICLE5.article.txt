# The 						Anti-War March: A Victim Of Reality
## 
### FRED MANN Commentary 
At 4:00 p.m. Saturday afternoon, a San Francisco Examiner delivery truck
wound it's way through the traffic down Fulton Street, past the lines of
hitchhikers. The driver snarled at the crowds slowing his route, and yelled to those
walking home, "Well, did you end the war this time?"
Nobody bothered to answer. For the more than 150,000 tired peace
demonstrators, the question did not deserve one. No one ever really believed that
their walking through the streets of San Francisco would bring an end to the war
in Asia; it was like any other peace march- enjoyable symbolic protest designed to
influence Congress and soothe liberal consciences. Each year since 1964, the
marches have gotten bigger and bigger, and the cries for peace staler and staler.
They are predictable, an established part of the culture.
Saturday's outing seemed different however, Although the crowd was
enormous and the message abundantly clear, the feeling was gone, lost somewhere
between the sunshine and the cynicism. The spirit of the Moratoriums, still alive
for a portion of the crowd, was very much a thing of the past for others. The
events of the past 17 months had taken its toll on the idealism of countless young
marchers.
"I'm here because the Vietnamese dig it," said one girl almost apologetically.
"I know realistically that marches like this have never really accomplished
anything, but 1 figure they can't hurt, so here 1 am."
Lack Of Unity
Not even the desire for peace could successfully unite everyone there. The
march was divided into sections with each special interest group carrying banners
and mouthing occasional slogans. It was a more of a parade than a march. Business
executives banded together in coats and ties to protest for the first time their
united disagreement with a new economically unsound war. Longshoremen
delegations followed later under union banners, close to a huge group from
Berkeley's Gay Liberation Front playing "The Good Ship Lollipop" among other
songs.
There was no hostility among the groups. Unfortunately, there was also no
interaction.
A contingent carrying large NLF flags (undoubtedly left over from previous
demonstrations) were the loudest, shouting familiar anti-war cheers. The
obscenities shocked many older marchers and those watching from sidewalks.
"I'm in favor of all this," said one middle-aged man, "But why the vulgar
language? Is it to make your viewpoint more penetrating? You young people
should be ashamed to shout such vulgar words."
Slogans 'A Downer'
Many of those participating found it difficult to shout anything at all. vulgar or
not. "I feel really stupid yelling 'Peace Now' at a thing like this," admitted one
college-age male. "1 can rationalize being here because being with all these people
is really far out. But chanting a phrase for a hopeless cause is a real downer."
Some of the placards were new, obviously made for the occasion. One person
carried a sign reading "LBJ in '72" while a possibly confusing banner across the
sundeck window of a hospital stated: "Sick People Say Get the Hell Out." Other,
more conventional signs were sprinkled throughout urging everyone to "Dump
Nixon" and "Bring the Boys Home." Special interest groups added their messages,
such as "Make Wine, Not War Napa Valley Peace Coalition."
Those feeling the different spirit of this particular march carried other written
slogans and passed out leaflets reading: "Our Last March," and "One Too Many
Marches."
Time To Relax
At the Polo Fields, the site of the rally itself, most of the interest was turned to
finding a comfortable patch of grass on which to recouperate from the long walk.
Hovering helecopters made understanding the scheduled speakers an impossible
task. Many never even treid.
The long line of speakers filed up to the microphone, each individual
demanding an end to the war for numerous different reasons. A Student Mobe
leader encouraged the crowd and reminded them to "see how powerful we are."
Some stood and applauded. Others chuckled quietly. Most didn't hear him.
For the first time since war protests began on a mass scale, many of those
protesting realized that "dumping Nixon" or "dumping Johnson" just might not
mean an immediate end to the war and all it has caused.
But still they came although somewhat half-heartedly mingling with people,
listening to the music, and once again registering a protest against the never-ending
war. "1 really don't know why 1 came," said one girl after it was all over. "Except
that they (the marches) are always fun."
It may have been the last hurrah of the great cultural event known as the peace
march, but most likely there will be others in the future. In any event, it did not
do a lot to end the great cultural event known as the Vietnam war.
