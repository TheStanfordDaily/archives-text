# The
						Anti-War March: A Victim Of Reality
## 
### FRED MANN Commentary 
At 4:00 p.m. Saturday afternoon, a San Francisco Examiner delivery truck
wound it's way through the traffic down Fulton Street, past the lines of
hitchhikers. The driver snarled at the crowds slowing his route, and yelled to those
walking home, "Well, did you end the war this time?"
Nobody bothered to answer. For the more than 150,000 tired peace
demonstrators, the question did not deserve one. No one ever really believed that
their walking through the streets of San Francisco would bring an end to the war
in Asia; it was like any other peace march- enjoyable symbolic protest designed to
influence Congress and soothe liberal consciences. Each year since 1964, the
marches have gotten bigger and bigger, and the cries for peace staler and staler.
They are predictable, an established part of the culture.
Saturday's outing seemed different however, Although the crowd was
enormous and the message abundantly clear, the feeling was gone, lost somewhere
between the sunshine and the cynicism. The spirit of the Moratoriums, still alive
for a portion of the crowd, was very much a thing of the past for others. The
events of the past 17 months had taken its toll on the idealism of countless young
marchers.
"I'm here because the Vietnamese dig it," said one girl almost apologetically.
"I know realistically that marches like this have never really accomplished
anything, but 1 figure they can't hurt, so here 1 am."
Lack Of Unity
Not even the desire for peace could successfully unite everyone there. The
march was divided into sections with each special interest group carrying banners
and mouthing occasional slogans. It was a more of a parade than a march. Business
executives banded together in coats and ties to protest for the first time their
united disagreement with a new economically unsound war. Longshoremen
delegations followed later under union banners, close to a huge group from
Berkeley's Gay Liberation Front playing "The Good Ship Lollipop" among other
songs.
There was no hostility among the groups. Unfortunately, there was also no
interaction.
A contingent carrying large NLF flags (undoubtedly left over from previous
demonstrations) were the loudest, shouting familiar anti-war cheers. The
obscenities shocked many older marchers and those watching from sidewalks.
"I'm in favor of all this," said one middle-aged man, "But why the vulgar
language? Is it to make your viewpoint more penetrating? You young people
should be ashamed to shout such vulgar words."
Slogans 'A Downer'
Many of those participating found it difficult to shout anything at all. vulgar or
not. "I feel really stupid yelling 'Peace Now' at a thing like this," admitted one
