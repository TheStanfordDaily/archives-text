# Washington Demonstration
## 'Everyone There Except Nixon' 
### ED KOHN Special to the Stanford Daily 
Washington, April 24—Several hundred thousand
strong, "the army of the people" today gathered
peacefully on the grounds of the Capitol building to
demand that the U.S. withdraw from Indochina now.
The demonstrators, mostly young and mostly
hite, poured down Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly
tour hours chanting, "Peace Now! and held an
unprecedented, five-hour rally that reiterated their
demand of "out now!"
Large numbers of trade unionists, professionals,
and groups such as the Bronx Citizens for Peace were
highly visible during the slow, dusty procession and
the lengthy rally. Several hundred Gl's were at the
head of the march, although none were in uniform.
Varied Crowd Counts
Police estimates of the crowd ranged from
200,000 and 250,000 while march organizers claimed
an attendance of about 500,000.
Sponsored by the National Peace Action Coalition,
an umbrella organization that includes the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice and the National
Welfare Rights Organization, today's demonstration
was the second largest in Washington's history. The
largest crowd, officially estimated at 320,000, massed
for the November 1969 Moritorium.
Senator Speaks
"We have bled too much, committed too many
horrors and the time to get out is now," Senator
Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) told the cheering crowd.
"The only way to bring our prisoners ol war home
is to get out now: the only way we can renew our
commitment to mankind is to get out now. Let out
voices sound the two great words of peace in no
uncertain terms - out now!" Hartke said, and the
crowd echoed his sentiments for nearly a minute.

Coretta S. King, who was introduced as the "First
Lady of America," asked the nation to pay tribute to
her slain husband by withdrawing all troops by
August 28, the eighth anniversary of Dr. King's huge
civil rights march on Washington.
John Kerry, a leader of anti-war veterans who have
been lobbying and demonstrating on Capitol Hill for
the past week, told the crowd that, "This is not the
struggle of one month, or one year or one war. It's a
contribution we must make for the rest of our lives,"
he said.
"Thirty years from now, when our brothers go
down the street without an arm or a leg or a face and
the children ask why, we'll be able to say Vietnam.
And we'll mean the place where America finally
turned and where soldiers like us helped in the
turning," he concluded.
Rep. Bella Ab/.ug (D-N.Y.) drew loud applause
when she announced, "It looks like everyone is here
today except Richard Nixon. He's in retreat at Camp
David (Md.) and he is in retreat from the American
people." Ab/ug also noted that the President is "in
contempt of the American people."
Fish Cheer
Perhaps the best response of the day came in reply
to "Country Joe" McDonald's famed "Fish Cheer"
and his "Feel- like- I'm fixin'- to-die-rag," which
echoed for blocks.
"All too many of you here are not ready to take
up the course of fighting repression against blacks and
poor people here at home," Dr. George Wiley,
director of the National Welfare Rights Organization,
told the rapidly disappearing crowd. "Too many
people here have forgotten that this demonstration
had three aims an end to repression and a freeing of
all political prisoners here at home, as well as ending
tlx. u,!ir " Wil.»v Other sneakers included

'Chicago Seven' David Dellinger, SCLC President Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy, and representatives of
various student, Black, Chicano and Gay Liberation
organizations. Angela Davis' mother also drew a warm
response from the crowd.
Little Trouble
City police were present in large numbers but most
found they had little to do as protest organizers had
arranged for thousands of marshalls to line the
sixteen block march mute and the stops leading to
the Capitol.
About 25 persons were arrested, mostly on charges
of disorderly conduct. The only major incident of the
day came when a brief fight broke out between
marchers and members of the American Nazi Party.
Nine persons were taken into custody after that fight.
Nearly 800 people joined a "break away rally"
sponsored by youths who claimed to be members of
the Students for a Democratic Society. The group
calling for a worker-student alliance, demonstrated in
front of an unemployment office. it marched
further uptown, was met by police, and quietly
disbanded.
Sightseers
As tin 1 peace demonstrators passed landmarks on
the parade route such as the Justice Dept. and the
FBI, many made obscene gestures, booed, and
shouted traditional anti war slogans including "one,
two, three, four, we don't want your fucking war."
FVw of those who marched here today thought
that their actions would force an immediate end to
the war. Most believed that they could gain additional
influence on Capitol Hill, while others thought that
the demonstration would have some value as
"protective reaction" against the President's war
policies. "1 think we would have invaded (North
Vietnam) if people had not protested the war during
the last two years," a Korean veteran said.

BOMB DAMAGE-The early-morning explosion Friday tore this hole in the
ceiling of Building 10's second floor the area immediately above the secretarial
desks. Damage, chiefly structural, was tentatively estimated at $25,000.
Washington, April 24—Several hundred thousand
strong, "the army of the people" today gathered
peacefully on the grounds of the Capitol building to
demand that the U.S. withdraw from Indochina now.
The demonstrators, mostly young and mostly
hite, poured down Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly
tour hours chanting, "Peace Now! and held an
unprecedented, five-hour rally that reiterated their
demand of "out now!"
Large numbers of trade unionists, professionals,
and groups such as the Bronx Citizens for Peace were
highly visible during the slow, dusty procession and
the lengthy rally. Several hundred Gl's were at the
head of the march, although none were in uniform.
Varied Crowd Counts
Police estimates of the crowd ranged from
200,000 and 250,000 while march organizers claimed
an attendance of about 500,000.
Sponsored by the National Peace Action Coalition,
an umbrella organization that includes the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice and the National
Welfare Rights Organization, today's demonstration
was the second largest in Washington's history. The
largest crowd, officially estimated at 320,000, massed
for the November 1969 Moritorium.
Senator Speaks
"We have bled too much, committed too many
horrors and the time to get out is now," Senator
Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) told the cheering crowd.
"The only way to bring our prisoners ol war home
is to get out now: the only way we can renew our
commitment to mankind is to get out now. Let out
voices sound the two great words of peace in no
uncertain terms - out now!" Hartke said, and the
crowd echoed his sentiments for nearly a minute.

Coretta S. King, who was introduced as the "First
Lady of America," asked the nation to pay tribute to
her slain husband by withdrawing all troops by
August 28, the eighth anniversary of Dr. King's huge
civil rights march on Washington.
John Kerry, a leader of anti-war veterans who have
been lobbying and demonstrating on Capitol Hill for
the past week, told the crowd that, "This is not the
struggle of one month, or one year or one war. It's a
contribution we must make for the rest of our lives,"
he said.
"Thirty years from now, when our brothers go
down the street without an arm or a leg or a face and
the children ask why, we'll be able to say Vietnam.
And we'll mean the place where America finally
turned and where soldiers like us helped in the
turning," he concluded.
Rep. Bella Ab/.ug (D-N.Y.) drew loud applause
when she announced, "It looks like everyone is here
today except Richard Nixon. He's in retreat at Camp
David (Md.) and he is in retreat from the American
people." Ab/ug also noted that the President is "in
contempt of the American people."
Fish Cheer
Perhaps the best response of the day came in reply
to "Country Joe" McDonald's famed "Fish Cheer"
and his "Feel- like- I'm fixin'- to-die-rag," which
echoed for blocks.
"All too many of you here are not ready to take
up the course of fighting repression against blacks and
poor people here at home," Dr. George Wiley,
director of the National Welfare Rights Organization,
told the rapidly disappearing crowd. "Too many
people here have forgotten that this demonstration
had three aims an end to repression and a freeing of
all political prisoners here at home, as well as ending
tlx. u,!ir " Wil.»v Other sneakers included

'Chicago Seven' David Dellinger, SCLC President Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy, and representatives of
various student, Black, Chicano and Gay Liberation
organizations. Angela Davis' mother also drew a warm
response from the crowd.
Little Trouble
City police were present in large numbers but most
found they had little to do as protest organizers had
arranged for thousands of marshalls to line the
sixteen block march mute and the stops leading to
the Capitol.
About 25 persons were arrested, mostly on charges
of disorderly conduct. The only major incident of the
day came when a brief fight broke out between
marchers and members of the American Nazi Party.
Nine persons were taken into custody after that fight.
Nearly 800 people joined a "break away rally"
sponsored by youths who claimed to be members of
the Students for a Democratic Society. The group
calling for a worker-student alliance, demonstrated in
front of an unemployment office. it marched
further uptown, was met by police, and quietly
disbanded.
Sightseers
As tin 1 peace demonstrators passed landmarks on
the parade route such as the Justice Dept. and the
FBI, many made obscene gestures, booed, and
shouted traditional anti war slogans including "one,
two, three, four, we don't want your fucking war."
FVw of those who marched here today thought
that their actions would force an immediate end to
the war. Most believed that they could gain additional
influence on Capitol Hill, while others thought that
the demonstration would have some value as
"protective reaction" against the President's war
policies. "1 think we would have invaded (North
Vietnam) if people had not protested the war during
the last two years," a Korean veteran said.

influence on Capitol Hill, while others thought that
the demonstration would have some value as
"protective reaction" against the President's war
policies. "1 think we would have invaded (North
Vietnam) if people had not protested the war during
the last two years," a Korean veteran said.

Washington, April 24—Several hundred thousand
strong, "the army of the people" today gathered
peacefully on the grounds of the Capitol building to
demand that the U.S. withdraw from Indochina now.
The demonstrators, mostly young and mostly
hite, poured down Pennsylvania Avenue for nearly
tour hours chanting, "Peace Now! and held an
unprecedented, five-hour rally that reiterated their
demand of "out now!"
Large numbers of trade unionists, professionals,
and groups such as the Bronx Citizens for Peace were
highly visible during the slow, dusty procession and
the lengthy rally. Several hundred Gl's were at the
head of the march, although none were in uniform.
Varied Crowd Counts
Police estimates of the crowd ranged from
200,000 and 250,000 while march organizers claimed
an attendance of about 500,000.
Sponsored by the National Peace Action Coalition,
an umbrella organization that includes the People's
Coalition for Peace and Justice and the National
Welfare Rights Organization, today's demonstration
was the second largest in Washington's history. The
largest crowd, officially estimated at 320,000, massed
for the November 1969 Moritorium.
Senator Speaks
"We have bled too much, committed too many
horrors and the time to get out is now," Senator
Vance Hartke (D-Ind.) told the cheering crowd.
"The only way to bring our prisoners ol war home
is to get out now: the only way we can renew our
commitment to mankind is to get out now. Let out
voices sound the two great words of peace in no
uncertain terms - out now!" Hartke said, and the
crowd echoed his sentiments for nearly a minute.

Coretta S. King, who was introduced as the "First
Lady of America," asked the nation to pay tribute to
her slain husband by withdrawing all troops by
August 28, the eighth anniversary of Dr. King's huge
civil rights march on Washington.
John Kerry, a leader of anti-war veterans who have
been lobbying and demonstrating on Capitol Hill for
the past week, told the crowd that, "This is not the
struggle of one month, or one year or one war. It's a
contribution we must make for the rest of our lives,"
he said.
"Thirty years from now, when our brothers go
down the street without an arm or a leg or a face and
the children ask why, we'll be able to say Vietnam.
And we'll mean the place where America finally
turned and where soldiers like us helped in the
turning," he concluded.
Rep. Bella Ab/.ug (D-N.Y.) drew loud applause
when she announced, "It looks like everyone is here
today except Richard Nixon. He's in retreat at Camp
David (Md.) and he is in retreat from the American
people." Ab/ug also noted that the President is "in
contempt of the American people."
Fish Cheer
Perhaps the best response of the day came in reply
to "Country Joe" McDonald's famed "Fish Cheer"
and his "Feel- like- I'm fixin'- to-die-rag," which
echoed for blocks.
"All too many of you here are not ready to take
up the course of fighting repression against blacks and
poor people here at home," Dr. George Wiley,
director of the National Welfare Rights Organization,
told the rapidly disappearing crowd. "Too many
people here have forgotten that this demonstration
had three aims an end to repression and a freeing of
all political prisoners here at home, as well as ending
tlx. u,!ir " Wil.»v Other sneakers included

'Chicago Seven' David Dellinger, SCLC President Rev.
Ralph David Abernathy, and representatives of
various student, Black, Chicano and Gay Liberation
organizations. Angela Davis' mother also drew a warm
response from the crowd.
Little Trouble
City police were present in large numbers but most
found they had little to do as protest organizers had
arranged for thousands of marshalls to line the
sixteen block march mute and the stops leading to
the Capitol.
About 25 persons were arrested, mostly on charges
of disorderly conduct. The only major incident of the
day came when a brief fight broke out between
marchers and members of the American Nazi Party.
Nine persons were taken into custody after that fight.
Nearly 800 people joined a "break away rally"
sponsored by youths who claimed to be members of
the Students for a Democratic Society. The group
calling for a worker-student alliance, demonstrated in
front of an unemployment office. it marched
further uptown, was met by police, and quietly
disbanded.
Sightseers
As tin 1 peace demonstrators passed landmarks on
the parade route such as the Justice Dept. and the
FBI, many made obscene gestures, booed, and
shouted traditional anti war slogans including "one,
two, three, four, we don't want your fucking war."
FVw of those who marched here today thought
that their actions would force an immediate end to
the war. Most believed that they could gain additional
influence on Capitol Hill, while others thought that
the demonstration would have some value as
"protective reaction" against the President's war
policies. "1 think we would have invaded (North
Vietnam) if people had not protested the war during
the last two years," a Korean veteran said.
