Condemnation of a brutal act such as
Friday morning's bombing should not
come hard to this campus. The blast
endangered the lite of at least one
person and might have killed or injured
many more had it exploded in the daytime.
And, while it is unknown at this juncture
who was responsible, the act certainly
implemented the rhetoric of revolutionaries
who claim to be working for the
betterment of society. It is chilling to
realize that human life is held in as little
regard by these revolutionaries as it is by
the men who shape our policies in
Indochina and the institutions which
support these policies such as Stanford
University.
Many people here, like us, will condemn both
the complicity of this University in the
Indochinese war and Friday's bombing. Many, too,
will be appalled only at the bombing, choosing to
ignore the more distant but no less brutal genocide
in Asia, or the brutal land use and investment
policies practiced by Stanford at home. We cannot
put on these blinders and condemn the act while
ignoring the situation which may have spawned it.
But anyone who tries to justify this act as a means

of combatting institutionalized violence is putting
on even more restrictive blinders.
Violence in one quarter is seldom, if ever, a
cure for violence in another. Terrorizing many
people and endangering many lives is a tactic as
dehumanizing to the practioner as the daily
violence of Vietnam is to a soldier. Near killing
and destruction at Stanford are not going to bring
peace to Indochina.
It has been a tendency, for some time, for
liberals to sympathize with the goals of radicals
and revolutionaries. This sympathy is often born
of the frustration felt by many who are not
radicals and yet have seen peaceful efforts toward
change fail time and time again. Often this
sympathy has been used as an excuse for the
acceptance of pat ideas such as "goals are more
important than tactics." This sympathy can be
paralyzing. We have to work to stup brutality,
even if its goals are supposedly "righteous."
Friday's bombing may have awakened many to
this realization. We cannot continue to
condone—if we ever have condoned escalating
violence in the hope that it will make us a better
society. We cannot remain paralyzed by our
sympathies. And we cannot accept the slogan "All
means necessary," when those means may willfully
ignore the value of human life which is as
precious in this country as in Asia.
