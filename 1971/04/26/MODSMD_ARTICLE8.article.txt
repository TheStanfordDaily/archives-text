moving force
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a Christian, 1 find it
necessary to admit that
California's "Jesus Movement" is
in part a sociological
phenomenon a product, as the
Duily article called it, of
"relativism, of uncertainty, of
troubled times." Some troubled
people today are realizing that all
the answers don't lie within their
own powers, and are looking to
Christianity. Some find something
real. Others must certainly be
along just for the trip.
But insofar as the Daily article
implied that Christ is a giant pat
on the back, a good feeling among
friends, it is a not-so-subtle
rip-off. What Christians are
asserting at Stanford, and
showing, is that Christ is an
actively moving force in their
lives. This has had, generally, its

first effects in their relationships
with other people.
Bui it will not end there, for
Christ has things to say about our
entire life: our political life, our
social life, our intellectual life,
what we do with our money, what
we do with our time. We are, most
of us, young Christians. We are
unsure at this point of what can
be accomplished through student
political action, or of what
precisely constitutes a Christian
role in times like today. But we
are searching for answers, and we
are searching from a firm base:
our life in Christ.
This is a frightening age. Right
here at Stanford psychologists and
geneticists are working on tools
which have manipulative powers
of incredible magnitude. To
oppose manipulation with
political power alone will not
work. You will have to have an
ethical base to build on. We have
that base.
Change, we believe, starts with
the individual. We see the
possibility of amelioration
through new political and social
arrangements, but no possibility
of utopia until the character of
men has changed. Our characters
have begun to change, through the
power of Christ.
That change does not end with
the individual, any more than
individual's life ends at the
boundaries of his skin. We are
pledged to help other men. We
invite you to accept Christ and
join us.

pointless story
Editor, THE DAILY:
What can you say about a
Daily story that died'? That it was
pointless? That on a scale of 10 it
rated negative-1 0?
Tom Given's "Commentary" in
the April 23 Daily on the San Jose
draft board protest by Stanford
Law Students was not only
journalistically indefensible, but,
completely missed the point of
the demonstration.
I will pass over the numerous
factual inaccuracies that riddled
the story. So what if the arrested
students' "few supporters"
numbered 30, so what if police
captain "Donald Ross's" name is

Ross Donald, and that the charge
was breaking Penal Code section
602 -J, not "602-A"7 l am used to
the Daily's sloppy fact-checking.
What appalled me about (iiven's
story was the cynical and
patronizing attitude which
permeated the piece.
He says the protest "seemed
pointless." For his information,
the point was quite clear. The
morning demonstration at HFC
was meant to underscore the tie-in
of even innocuous-sounding
corporations with the war-effort.
Ot course it's an issue "without
glamor," Bui the fact that most
people don't know about such
connections makes publicity
about them intrinsically valuable.
Even HFC's office manager agreed
to that.
The draft-board blocking was
more direct, and was an attempt
to show the government that its
war actions would be harder «nd
harder to continue in the future
without popular support. In this
connection the response of the
police was enlightening. They
could have, and in the past would
have, either come in swinging, or
at least dragged everyone off to
jail. Doubltess this would have
made the story more "glamorous"
to the I)uii\. But they didn't.
They were polite, decent, almost
apologetic. A policeman even told
the students later that he felt like
joining them in front of the
doorway to the board. Such an
attitude by San Jose police
manifests the increasing effect of
anti-war protests on the public.
Finally, the story kept saying
the l 3 students were "cited and
released." This was just a
procedural shortcut, and should
not obscure the fact that they
were really, honestly, truly
arrested. They have to appear for
arraignment this week, and they
face jail terms which may
hamper their future activities as
lawyers. This action was more
than the "cops and robbers" game
Given makes it out to be.
On a scale of 10, this
principled and non-violent protest
rated 11. It deserved better than a
hatchet job by a reporter more
concerned with superficial
sensationalism than solid
substance.

our life in Christ.
This is a frightening age. Right
here at Stanford psychologists and
geneticists are working on tools
which have manipulative powers
of incredible magnitude. To
oppose manipulation with
political power alone will not
work. You will have to have an
ethical base to build on. We have
that base.
Change, we believe, starts with
the individual. We see the
possibility of amelioration
through new political and social
arrangements, but no possibility
of utopia until the character of
men has changed. Our characters
have begun to change, through the
power of Christ.
That change does not end with
the individual, any more than
individual's life ends at the
boundaries of his skin. We are
pledged to help other men. We
invite you to accept Christ and

pointless story
Editor, THE DAILY:
What can you say about a
Daily story that died'? That it was
pointless? That on a scale of 10 it
rated negative-1 0?
Tom Given's "Commentary" in
the April 23 Daily on the San Jose
draft board protest by Stanford
Law Students was not only
journalistically indefensible, but,
completely missed the point of
the demonstration.
I will pass over the numerous
factual inaccuracies that riddled
the story. So what if the arrested
students' "few supporters"
numbered 30, so what if police
captain "Donald Ross's" name is

Ross Donald, and that the charge
was breaking Penal Code section
602 -J, not "602-A"7 l am used to
the Daily's sloppy fact-checking.
What appalled me about (iiven's
story was the cynical and
patronizing attitude which
permeated the piece.
He says the protest "seemed
pointless." For his information,
the point was quite clear. The
morning demonstration at HFC
was meant to underscore the tie-in
of even innocuous-sounding
corporations with the war-effort.
Ot course it's an issue "without
glamor," Bui the fact that most
people don't know about such
connections makes publicity
about them intrinsically valuable.
Even HFC's office manager agreed
to that.
The draft-board blocking was
more direct, and was an attempt
to show the government that its
war actions would be harder «nd
harder to continue in the future
without popular support. In this
connection the response of the
police was enlightening. They
could have, and in the past would
have, either come in swinging, or
at least dragged everyone off to
jail. Doubltess this would have
made the story more "glamorous"
to the I)uii\. But they didn't.
They were polite, decent, almost
apologetic. A policeman even told
the students later that he felt like
joining them in front of the
doorway to the board. Such an
attitude by San Jose police
manifests the increasing effect of
anti-war protests on the public.
Finally, the story kept saying
the l 3 students were "cited and
released." This was just a
procedural shortcut, and should
not obscure the fact that they
were really, honestly, truly
arrested. They have to appear for
arraignment this week, and they
face jail terms which may
hamper their future activities as
lawyers. This action was more
than the "cops and robbers" game
Given makes it out to be.
On a scale of 10, this
principled and non-violent protest
rated 11. It deserved better than a
hatchet job by a reporter more
concerned with superficial
sensationalism than solid
substance.

As a Christian, 1 find it
necessary to admit that
California's "Jesus Movement" is
in part a sociological
phenomenon a product, as the
Duily article called it, of
"relativism, of uncertainty, of
troubled times." Some troubled
people today are realizing that all
the answers don't lie within their
own powers, and are looking to
Christianity. Some find something
real. Others must certainly be
along just for the trip.
But insofar as the Daily article
implied that Christ is a giant pat
on the back, a good feeling among
friends, it is a not-so-subtle
rip-off. What Christians are
asserting at Stanford, and
showing, is that Christ is an
actively moving force in their
lives. This has had, generally, its

first effects in their relationships
with other people.
Bui it will not end there, for
Christ has things to say about our
entire life: our political life, our
social life, our intellectual life,
what we do with our money, what
we do with our time. We are, most
of us, young Christians. We are

the story. So what if the arrested
students' "few supporters"
numbered 30, so what if police
captain "Donald Ross's" name is

Ross Donald, and that the charge
was breaking Penal Code section
602 -J, not "602-A"7 l am used to
the Daily's sloppy fact-checking.
What appalled me about (iiven's
story was the cynical and
patronizing attitude which
permeated the piece.
He says the protest "seemed
pointless." For his information,
the point was quite clear. The
morning demonstration at HFC
was meant to underscore the tie-in
of even innocuous-sounding
corporations with the war-effort.
Ot course it's an issue "without
glamor," Bui the fact that most
people don't know about such
connections makes publicity
about them intrinsically valuable.
Even HFC's office manager agreed
to that.
The draft-board blocking was
more direct, and was an attempt
to show the government that its
war actions would be harder «nd
harder to continue in the future
without popular support. In this
connection the response of the
police was enlightening. They
could have, and in the past would
have, either come in swinging, or
at least dragged everyone off to
jail. Doubltess this would have
made the story more "glamorous"
to the I)uii\. But they didn't.
They were polite, decent, almost
apologetic. A policeman even told
the students later that he felt like
joining them in front of the
doorway to the board. Such an
attitude by San Jose police
manifests the increasing effect of
anti-war protests on the public.
Finally, the story kept saying
the l 3 students were "cited and
released." This was just a
procedural shortcut, and should
not obscure the fact that they
were really, honestly, truly
arrested. They have to appear for
arraignment this week, and they
face jail terms which may
hamper their future activities as
lawyers. This action was more
than the "cops and robbers" game
Given makes it out to be.
On a scale of 10, this
principled and non-violent protest
rated 11. It deserved better than a
hatchet job by a reporter more
concerned with superficial
sensationalism than solid
substance.
