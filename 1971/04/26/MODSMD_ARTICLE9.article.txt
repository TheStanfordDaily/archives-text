# Responses To 'We Are All Guilty'
## 
### CHRIS HOCKER SCOTT BURKE 
Yesterday, as is my wont when
my stomach feels especially
strong, 1 took a look at the
editorial page of the Daily.
Immediately my eye was caught
by the headline "We Are All
Guilty" by Larry Diamond.
"Well," I thought, "what am I
guilty of today? War crimes?
Racism? Oppression? Chasing
Little Eva across the Ohio River
with a pack of bloodhounds? It
must be something important, or
Larry Diamond wouldn't write
about it."
As it turned out, my first guess
was correct. I was- and
presumably still am—guilty of war
crimes. After all, as Larry- says, a
people is "responsible for the
policies and actions of its
government."
I'm not going to discuss the
issue of war crimes with regard to
the United States, because to do
so would require the admission
that I don't think the United
States is the most evil nation that
ever existed, and to do that would
take more nerve than I am able to
summon right now. I do plan to
take issue with the concept of
"mass guilt" as put forth by Mr.
Diamond and his ilk, however,
because I believe that that
concept plays an important role in
the perpetuation, not the
solution, of our problems.
Tenacious Emotion
Guilt is a tenacious emotion,
for if one is to be properly guilty,
one must be guilty not only while
the act is being committed, but
also after the act is completed.
That is, if I feel guilty for my
responsibility in alleged war
crimes now, I should continue to
feel guilty after the crimes have
ceased. If I am truly responsible
for criminal actions, that

responsibility does not end after I
am apprehended and punished,
for the actions have already been
taken and are irreversible. The
only way to relieve myself of guilt
is to realize that I was never guilty
in the first place.
Guilt is also a highly satisfying
emotion when dealt with in terms
of the all-encompassing, mass,
societal guilt of which Mr.
Diamond speaks. When Mr.
Diamond states that "we are all
guilty," 1 assume that he includes
himself in this verdict. Now, Mr.
Diamond is well aware that the
chances of being punished for this
guilt are close to zero. Therefore,
he is more than willing to declare
himself guilty and further, being
an equitable sort of guy, he is
equally willing to declare the rest
of his society guilty as well. I
mean, it's no fun to flagellate
yourself alone. It's better to have
everybody flagellating themselves
and each other. Community spirit,
and all that.
Mr. Diamond has discovered, I
have a feeling, that beating
yourself with a whip makes it
nearly impossible to do anything
constructive, although some
self-flagellants have developed the
ability to wield the whip with one
hand and gesticulate against
economic imperialism with the
other. But most people, when
faced with the choice of feeling
guilty or of solving a problem,
alone if necessary, will opt for the
whip. It's easier, and besides, you
get to meet more people that way.
Individual Solutions
Problems can only be solved on
an individual level. Each
individual must decide what he
believes is right and wrong, and
work to see that his actions are in
agreement with what he believes is
right. To demand, as Mr. Diamond

is demanding, that we adopt his
standards of right and wrong is
insulting. To insist, as Mr.
Diamond is insisting, that we all
feel guilty because we have
violated his moral standards is at
least presumptuous. And to force
these moral standards on others,
as I suspect Mr. Diamond would
like to do, is itself immoral.
If anything, Mr. Diamond
should feel guilty because he is a
liberal and because he feels he
should dictate the emotions of
each individual in the United
States. All the "concern" and all
the "deploring" and all the
"guilt"—and these are the verbal
fruits by which ye shall know
liberals —in the world is not going
to encourage each individual to
solve his problems at his own
level, which is the only way in
which these problems can
legitimately be solved.

Larry Diamond, in his article entitled "We Are All Guilty," is
himself guilty of one of two serious errors: either he has committed a
calculated act of repulsive demagogy; or, he has reached new heights
of thoughtlessness.
It is patently unfair to extend the notion of guilt for the war to
"all of us," according both to the actions of the Nuremburg Tribunal
and to the most fundamental principles of justice. If the Tribunal had
extended guilt for German war crimes to the entire German people,
every man, woman and child who lived in Germany would have been
punished for their complicity.
If Mr. Diamond took the time to examine conditions under which
he himself would be willing to accept responsibility and punishment
for some censurable act, he would probably have realized that a man
is "guilty" and deserving of a penalty only under the following
conditions: if he personally committed the act in question, or if he
caused the crime to be committed. In addition, the accused must be
conscious of what he is doing, and realize that the act is prohibited by
law.
None of these conditions pertain to "all the American people," as
Mr. Diamond asserts.
Such a vast extension of guilt or responsibility as Mr. Diamond
supports is particularly alarming if one considers its effects. He would
have us accept the notion that an entire people is guilty for the crimes
committed by "its government." If individuals are responsible for the
criminal acts of an institution over which they have no control, as is
the relation of most Americans to the Federal government (proven by
the impotency of their consistently expressed desire for peace in
elections and polls) then all relation between guilt and responsibility
breaks down. If we are "guilty" of crimes for which we are not
responsible, the two terms lose all meaning, and become weapons to
be used against one's enemies.
If an entire society ever accepted such principles, injustice in one
of two forms would be the inevitable result- either unfair punishment
for crimes never committed would become possible, as is the case in
government-sponsored racial and religious persecution, or many
crimes would go unpunished, for confessions of collective guilt are the
best possible safeguards against the discovery of culprits, and the very
magnitude of the crime the best possible excuse for doing nothing.
It is true that individuals and institutions should seek to bring the
war to an end, not because of any "guilt," but because it is manifestly
in the best interests of individuals, institutions, society and humanity
to do so.
