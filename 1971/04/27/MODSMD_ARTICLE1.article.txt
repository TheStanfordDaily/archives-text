# Arson Confirmed In Junipero Lounge Fire
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER DAVE SPECTOR 
A "set fire" swept through Junipero
House lounge early yesterday morning,
gutting the room completely and
causing an estimated $50,000-$75 ,000
damage.
The Junipero fire was reported at
3:24 a.m. within 10 minutes of two
other arson fires on campus. A
motorcycle was wheeled onto the
boathouse dock, set under a staircase,
and ignited at about 3:25, and a
molotov cocktail was hurled at a
Tresidder Union catering truck in a
yard behind the Old Union at about
3:15. Both fires were quickly brought
under control. A small fire at the same
time also occured at Roble, but no
alarm was turned in.
Fireman John Kelly suffered a
puncture wound in his arm fighting the
blaze. No other injuries were reported.
Definitely Set
Alan Carder, senior fire marshal for
Santa Clara County, stated yesterday
afternoon that the Junipero blaze was
definitely an arson fire, but would not
elaborate on the evidence leading to
that conclusion.
Two eyewitnesses, Donald Mcßride
and Eric Lausen, both freshman
residents of Junipero, stated that they
were studying in the foyer of the
lounge when a blast of air swept under
the connecting doors.
"It was so strong it lifted papers
right off the floor," said Mcßride. He
looked through the doors, saw the
couches in one corner on fire, and ran
to pull the alarm.
Junipero lounge is located in a
separate but adjoining structure to the
Wilbur dormitory, which houses 75
students.
The fire was under control at about
3:40, 15 minutes after the alarm was
turned in according to Stanford Fire
Marshall Frank Jurian. An investigation
of the blaze was undertaken
immediately.
KZSU reporter Peter Mauk, a
resident of an adjoining Wilbur
dormitory, reported that the flames
were "up to the roof of the place
almost immediately" and that there

was no one in the lounge when the
blaze started.
Lyman Comments
Commenting on the blaze, Stanford
President Richard Lyman stated
"Terrorism tends to be a tactic taken
by a protest movement that does not
have a mass following."
Lyman labelled the fire "atrocious,"
and added, "I think student concern
that a dormitory or buildings attached
to a dormitory could be a target is
going to make a substantial difference
in the outlook on campus."
Lyman's remarks were made
yesterday at a lunch with Junipero
residents.
Students in the dormitories of
Madera and Junipero used their fire
hoses to help quell the blaze. Madera's
second-floor fire hose, however, was
badly kinked about 15 feet from its
wall connection, and was useless.
Reaction
Reaction to the fire from Junipero
residents was sharp and angry. Mcßride
remarked, "This is far different from
setting a motorcycle on fire. If one of
us had not seen it, a lot of us would be
dead. That's noi vandalism; that's
murder."
Richa Williams, another freshman
resident of Junipero, stated "When
they keep burning things, its money
out of my pocket. It makes no sense.
I'm going to school under financial aid
for minorities, and this just means less
money for us.
"I'm for change, but not this way,"
she added.
Lounge Devastated
Shortly after the fire was quenched,
three inches of charred debris littered
the entire area of the lounge. Insulation
covering hung from the ceiling in strips
and the piano in the corner of the room
where the blaze began was virtually
unrecognizable.
Residents reported that this blaze
was the third in or near the house in
recent weeks. Last Saturday, a fire
ignited in a Dempster Dumpster near
the residence. Earlier in the quarter, a
fire started in the second-floor room of
Sarah Murdock, a freshman resident of

the dorm. According to John Cooniod,
a sophomore resident, this fire was
accidental, started by overturned
candles.
Coonrod told the Daily yesterday
"It seems like somebody's purposely
trying to terrorize Junipero - and they
may accelerate it in the future." He
cited Saturday's Dempster Dumpster
blaze and yesterday's severe fire, as
reasons for his anxiety.
Boathouse Blaze
Four lifeguards who live at the
boathouse on Lake Lagunita stated
early yesterday morning that they had
heard two people making "suspicious
noises" immediately before the blaze
ignited.
A girl's motorcycle, which has been
left on the gravel area near the
boathouse, was wheeled down under an
old stairwell. The two individuals, at
least one of them male, according to
lifeguard Peter Gadd, climbed the stairs
and carefully checked all the doors on
the premises.
"I heard a 'whoosh,' and heard two
people running away, but by the time I
got my window open they were gone,"
said Fred Haywood, another lifeguard.
The lifeguards were able to
extinguish most of the blaze with fire
extinguishers and blankets before
Stanford Fire units arrived on the
scene.

HOLOCAUST—FIames engulf Junipero Lounge at the height of yesterday morning's fire. Stanford fireman, shown
examining the charred debris afterwards, indicated surprise that the flames spread so quickly.
A few minutes earlier, a molotov
cocktail was hurled at the gas tank of a
Tresidder delivery truck, causing minor
damage. A back corner of the truck was
seared by the smoke and flames, and
there were blisters on the paint near the
gas tank from the heat.
The molotov cocktail was ignited by
an Anthes Brand fuse, according to
Stanford police officers on the scene.
Another unlit fuse was discovered some
50 feet away, near the gate of the Old
Corporation yard.
The Roble blaze in the third floor
bathroom had burned out by the time
it was discovered. A trash can had been

placed on a toilet seat next to an open
window and papers in it set afire.
Students said fire errupted at
approximately 3:30 a.m.
Following a house meeting last
night, the majority of Junipero
residents attacked the University News
Service release as "very irresponsible in
its Monday noon release on the
Junipero fire.
"Through juxtaposition and
innuendo, the report implied that
Venceremos was somehow responsible
for the arson. This insinuation is
without evidence, particularly as the
fire endangered the lives of Venceremos
members sleeping in the house."

Another unlit fuse was discovered some
50 feet away, near the gate of the Old
Corporation yard.
The Roble blaze in the third floor
bathroom had burned out by the time
it was discovered. A trash can had been

placed on a toilet seat next to an open
window and papers in it set afire.
Students said fire errupted at
approximately 3:30 a.m.
Following a house meeting last
night, the majority of Junipero
residents attacked the University News
Service release as "very irresponsible in
its Monday noon release on the
Junipero fire.
"Through juxtaposition and
innuendo, the report implied that
Venceremos was somehow responsible
for the arson. This insinuation is
without evidence, particularly as the
fire endangered the lives of Venceremos
members sleeping in the house."
A "set fire" swept through Junipero
House lounge early yesterday morning,
gutting the room completely and
causing an estimated $50,000-$75 ,000
damage.
The Junipero fire was reported at
3:24 a.m. within 10 minutes of two
other arson fires on campus. A
motorcycle was wheeled onto the
boathouse dock, set under a staircase,
and ignited at about 3:25, and a
molotov cocktail was hurled at a
Tresidder Union catering truck in a
yard behind the Old Union at about
3:15. Both fires were quickly brought
under control. A small fire at the same
time also occured at Roble, but no
alarm was turned in.
Fireman John Kelly suffered a
puncture wound in his arm fighting the
blaze. No other injuries were reported.
Definitely Set
Alan Carder, senior fire marshal for
Santa Clara County, stated yesterday
afternoon that the Junipero blaze was
definitely an arson fire, but would not
elaborate on the evidence leading to
that conclusion.
Two eyewitnesses, Donald Mcßride
and Eric Lausen, both freshman
residents of Junipero, stated that they
were studying in the foyer of the
lounge when a blast of air swept under
the connecting doors.
"It was so strong it lifted papers
right off the floor," said Mcßride. He
looked through the doors, saw the
couches in one corner on fire, and ran
to pull the alarm.
Junipero lounge is located in a
separate but adjoining structure to the
Wilbur dormitory, which houses 75
students.
The fire was under control at about
3:40, 15 minutes after the alarm was
turned in according to Stanford Fire
Marshall Frank Jurian. An investigation
of the blaze was undertaken
immediately.
KZSU reporter Peter Mauk, a
resident of an adjoining Wilbur
dormitory, reported that the flames
were "up to the roof of the place
almost immediately" and that there

was no one in the lounge when the
blaze started.
Lyman Comments
Commenting on the blaze, Stanford
President Richard Lyman stated
"Terrorism tends to be a tactic taken
by a protest movement that does not
have a mass following."
Lyman labelled the fire "atrocious,"
and added, "I think student concern
that a dormitory or buildings attached
to a dormitory could be a target is
going to make a substantial difference
in the outlook on campus."
Lyman's remarks were made
yesterday at a lunch with Junipero
residents.
Students in the dormitories of
Madera and Junipero used their fire
hoses to help quell the blaze. Madera's
second-floor fire hose, however, was
badly kinked about 15 feet from its
wall connection, and was useless.
Reaction
Reaction to the fire from Junipero
residents was sharp and angry. Mcßride
remarked, "This is far different from
setting a motorcycle on fire. If one of
us had not seen it, a lot of us would be
dead. That's noi vandalism; that's
murder."
Richa Williams, another freshman
resident of Junipero, stated "When
they keep burning things, its money
out of my pocket. It makes no sense.
I'm going to school under financial aid
for minorities, and this just means less
money for us.
"I'm for change, but not this way,"
she added.
Lounge Devastated
Shortly after the fire was quenched,
three inches of charred debris littered
the entire area of the lounge. Insulation
covering hung from the ceiling in strips
and the piano in the corner of the room
where the blaze began was virtually
unrecognizable.
Residents reported that this blaze
was the third in or near the house in
recent weeks. Last Saturday, a fire
ignited in a Dempster Dumpster near
the residence. Earlier in the quarter, a
fire started in the second-floor room of
Sarah Murdock, a freshman resident of

the dorm. According to John Cooniod,
a sophomore resident, this fire was
accidental, started by overturned
candles.
Coonrod told the Daily yesterday
"It seems like somebody's purposely
trying to terrorize Junipero - and they
may accelerate it in the future." He
cited Saturday's Dempster Dumpster
blaze and yesterday's severe fire, as
reasons for his anxiety.
Boathouse Blaze
Four lifeguards who live at the
boathouse on Lake Lagunita stated
early yesterday morning that they had
heard two people making "suspicious
noises" immediately before the blaze
ignited.
A girl's motorcycle, which has been
left on the gravel area near the
boathouse, was wheeled down under an
old stairwell. The two individuals, at
least one of them male, according to
lifeguard Peter Gadd, climbed the stairs
and carefully checked all the doors on
the premises.
"I heard a 'whoosh,' and heard two
people running away, but by the time I
got my window open they were gone,"
said Fred Haywood, another lifeguard.
The lifeguards were able to
extinguish most of the blaze with fire
extinguishers and blankets before
Stanford Fire units arrived on the
scene.

HOLOCAUST—FIames engulf Junipero Lounge at the height of yesterday morning's fire. Stanford fireman, shown
examining the charred debris afterwards, indicated surprise that the flames spread so quickly.
A few minutes earlier, a molotov

The lifeguards were able to
extinguish most of the blaze with fire
extinguishers and blankets before
Stanford Fire units arrived on the
scene.

HOLOCAUST—FIames engulf Junipero Lounge at the height of yesterday morning's fire. Stanford fireman, shown
examining the charred debris afterwards, indicated surprise that the flames spread so quickly.
A few minutes earlier, a molotov
cocktail was hurled at the gas tank of a
Tresidder delivery truck, causing minor
damage. A back corner of the truck was
seared by the smoke and flames, and
there were blisters on the paint near the
gas tank from the heat.
The molotov cocktail was ignited by
an Anthes Brand fuse, according to
Stanford police officers on the scene.
Another unlit fuse was discovered some
50 feet away, near the gate of the Old
Corporation yard.
The Roble blaze in the third floor
bathroom had burned out by the time
it was discovered. A trash can had been

placed on a toilet seat next to an open
window and papers in it set afire.
Students said fire errupted at
approximately 3:30 a.m.
Following a house meeting last
night, the majority of Junipero
residents attacked the University News
Service release as "very irresponsible in
its Monday noon release on the
Junipero fire.
"Through juxtaposition and
innuendo, the report implied that
Venceremos was somehow responsible
for the arson. This insinuation is
without evidence, particularly as the
fire endangered the lives of Venceremos
members sleeping in the house."
A "set fire" swept through Junipero
House lounge early yesterday morning,
gutting the room completely and
causing an estimated $50,000-$75 ,000
damage.
The Junipero fire was reported at
3:24 a.m. within 10 minutes of two
other arson fires on campus. A
motorcycle was wheeled onto the
boathouse dock, set under a staircase,
and ignited at about 3:25, and a
molotov cocktail was hurled at a
Tresidder Union catering truck in a
yard behind the Old Union at about
3:15. Both fires were quickly brought
under control. A small fire at the same
time also occured at Roble, but no
alarm was turned in.
Fireman John Kelly suffered a
puncture wound in his arm fighting the
blaze. No other injuries were reported.
Definitely Set
Alan Carder, senior fire marshal for
Santa Clara County, stated yesterday
afternoon that the Junipero blaze was
definitely an arson fire, but would not
elaborate on the evidence leading to
that conclusion.
Two eyewitnesses, Donald Mcßride
and Eric Lausen, both freshman
residents of Junipero, stated that they
were studying in the foyer of the
lounge when a blast of air swept under
the connecting doors.
"It was so strong it lifted papers
right off the floor," said Mcßride. He
looked through the doors, saw the
couches in one corner on fire, and ran
to pull the alarm.
Junipero lounge is located in a
separate but adjoining structure to the
Wilbur dormitory, which houses 75
students.
The fire was under control at about
3:40, 15 minutes after the alarm was
turned in according to Stanford Fire
Marshall Frank Jurian. An investigation
of the blaze was undertaken
immediately.
KZSU reporter Peter Mauk, a
resident of an adjoining Wilbur
dormitory, reported that the flames
were "up to the roof of the place
almost immediately" and that there

was no one in the lounge when the
blaze started.
Lyman Comments
Commenting on the blaze, Stanford
President Richard Lyman stated
"Terrorism tends to be a tactic taken
by a protest movement that does not
have a mass following."
Lyman labelled the fire "atrocious,"
and added, "I think student concern
that a dormitory or buildings attached
to a dormitory could be a target is
going to make a substantial difference
in the outlook on campus."
Lyman's remarks were made
yesterday at a lunch with Junipero
residents.
Students in the dormitories of
Madera and Junipero used their fire
hoses to help quell the blaze. Madera's
second-floor fire hose, however, was
badly kinked about 15 feet from its
wall connection, and was useless.
Reaction
Reaction to the fire from Junipero
residents was sharp and angry. Mcßride
remarked, "This is far different from
setting a motorcycle on fire. If one of
us had not seen it, a lot of us would be
dead. That's noi vandalism; that's
murder."
Richa Williams, another freshman
resident of Junipero, stated "When
they keep burning things, its money
out of my pocket. It makes no sense.
I'm going to school under financial aid
for minorities, and this just means less
money for us.
"I'm for change, but not this way,"
she added.
Lounge Devastated
Shortly after the fire was quenched,
three inches of charred debris littered
the entire area of the lounge. Insulation
covering hung from the ceiling in strips
and the piano in the corner of the room
where the blaze began was virtually
unrecognizable.
Residents reported that this blaze
was the third in or near the house in
recent weeks. Last Saturday, a fire
ignited in a Dempster Dumpster near
the residence. Earlier in the quarter, a
fire started in the second-floor room of
Sarah Murdock, a freshman resident of

the dorm. According to John Cooniod,
a sophomore resident, this fire was
accidental, started by overturned
candles.
Coonrod told the Daily yesterday
"It seems like somebody's purposely
trying to terrorize Junipero - and they
may accelerate it in the future." He
cited Saturday's Dempster Dumpster
blaze and yesterday's severe fire, as
reasons for his anxiety.
Boathouse Blaze
Four lifeguards who live at the
boathouse on Lake Lagunita stated
early yesterday morning that they had
heard two people making "suspicious
noises" immediately before the blaze
ignited.
A girl's motorcycle, which has been
left on the gravel area near the
boathouse, was wheeled down under an
old stairwell. The two individuals, at
least one of them male, according to
lifeguard Peter Gadd, climbed the stairs
and carefully checked all the doors on
the premises.
"I heard a 'whoosh,' and heard two
people running away, but by the time I
got my window open they were gone,"
said Fred Haywood, another lifeguard.
The lifeguards were able to
extinguish most of the blaze with fire
extinguishers and blankets before
