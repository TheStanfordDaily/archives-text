# Campus Police Role May Change; Increased Security Needs Cited
## 
### CARLA KALLAN 
While no conclusive decisions have
yet been reached, the University may
augment the power of the Stanford
Police, possibly extending them full
peace officer status.
The present University budget shows
an increase of $320,000 for police and
fire protection over that of last year.
The bulk of this money will provide
additional manpower for the police
department, although funds for new
equipment will also go to the Fire
Department and to the Emergency
Communications Department.
The first steps toward tightening
campus security took place this
February when 11 additional officers
were hired as night watchmen. With the
upswing in vandalism and firebombings,
extra Santa Clara police have also been
called for night patrol. However,
"predicting the possible targets of
violence," said Provost Robert

Rosenzweig, "is all a big guessing
game."
Meanwhile, the University has
proposed a bill for consideration in the
state legislature that would permit
officers of private universities to
assume peace officer status.
A peace officer receives special
training, and must meet standards
imposed by law. His powers include
serving warrants of arrest, serving
search warrants, detaining people, and
gaining access to personal files and
records. He is paid by county, city, or
district government bodies, and his
authority is rooted in the state penal
code.
Private Security Force
By contrast, the current Stanford
Police Department is merely a private
security force employed by the
University. As such, its officers have no
more authority than do ordinary
citizens.

If the proposed bill is not passed by
the state legislature, there are other
routes the University can pursue to
obtain peace officer status for its police
force.
One alternative is to convert the
Stanford Police into Santa Clara
County deputies. This, in fact, was the
case until the state law was amended
some ten years ago.
Critics, however, point out several
problems in this arrangement. First, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff would be
held responsible for the actions of his
deputies when they were not really
working for him, but for a private
entity. The University must in turn
surrender its control over campus
policing to the sheriff. There are also
legal difficulties involved in this
proposal.
At present ten officers deputized by
the sheriff are employed by the
University. This arrangement is
necessary for parking enforcement,
since a University ticket would mean
little to a Palo Alto resident, whose car
is not registered with the University.
New District
Other methods for the University to
obtain men with peace officer status
include the creation of a separate police
district within the Stanford community
and the purchasing of additional
enforcement services from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff on a large-scale
basis. An earlier plan to annex Stanford
to Palo Alto and receive the protection
of the Palo Alto Police Department has
been discarded.
All these procedures are legally
complex, offering different operational
advantages and disadvantages. The
legislative alternative, which is
currently being acted upon, is
particularly desirable in that it would
not bind University officials to a
specific set of peace officer powers.
The success of the bill will not be
known until later this year, probably in
November. Meanwhile, issues of cost,
effectiveness, and control are being
investigated. Even if the bill is passed,
the University might not decide to give
its police peace officer status.
The final decision will be
determined by the police department,
the business office, and those directly
connected with the administration of
campus security. The President must
grant ultimate approval.

state legislature that would permit
officers of private universities to
assume peace officer status.
A peace officer receives special
training, and must meet standards
imposed by law. His powers include
serving warrants of arrest, serving
search warrants, detaining people, and
gaining access to personal files and
records. He is paid by county, city, or
district government bodies, and his
authority is rooted in the state penal
code.
Private Security Force
By contrast, the current Stanford
Police Department is merely a private
security force employed by the
University. As such, its officers have no
more authority than do ordinary
citizens.

If the proposed bill is not passed by
the state legislature, there are other
routes the University can pursue to
obtain peace officer status for its police
force.
One alternative is to convert the
Stanford Police into Santa Clara
County deputies. This, in fact, was the
case until the state law was amended
some ten years ago.
Critics, however, point out several
problems in this arrangement. First, the
Santa Clara County Sheriff would be
held responsible for the actions of his
deputies when they were not really
working for him, but for a private
entity. The University must in turn
surrender its control over campus
policing to the sheriff. There are also
legal difficulties involved in this
proposal.
At present ten officers deputized by
the sheriff are employed by the
University. This arrangement is
necessary for parking enforcement,
since a University ticket would mean
little to a Palo Alto resident, whose car
is not registered with the University.
New District
Other methods for the University to
obtain men with peace officer status
include the creation of a separate police
district within the Stanford community
and the purchasing of additional
enforcement services from the Santa
Clara County Sheriff on a large-scale
basis. An earlier plan to annex Stanford
to Palo Alto and receive the protection
of the Palo Alto Police Department has
been discarded.
All these procedures are legally
complex, offering different operational
advantages and disadvantages. The
legislative alternative, which is
currently being acted upon, is
particularly desirable in that it would
not bind University officials to a
specific set of peace officer powers.
The success of the bill will not be
known until later this year, probably in
November. Meanwhile, issues of cost,
effectiveness, and control are being
investigated. Even if the bill is passed,
the University might not decide to give
its police peace officer status.
The final decision will be
determined by the police department,
the business office, and those directly
connected with the administration of
campus security. The President must
grant ultimate approval.
While no conclusive decisions have
yet been reached, the University may
augment the power of the Stanford
Police, possibly extending them full
peace officer status.
The present University budget shows
an increase of $320,000 for police and
fire protection over that of last year.
The bulk of this money will provide
additional manpower for the police
department, although funds for new
equipment will also go to the Fire
Department and to the Emergency
Communications Department.
The first steps toward tightening
campus security took place this
February when 11 additional officers
were hired as night watchmen. With the
upswing in vandalism and firebombings,
extra Santa Clara police have also been
called for night patrol. However,
"predicting the possible targets of
violence," said Provost Robert

Rosenzweig, "is all a big guessing
game."
