# Chief Bell To Resign; Hits Lack Of Direction
## 
### 
Thomas F. Bell, Jr., 40, police chief
here, has resigned by "mutual
agreement" with the University
administration, officials announced
yesterday.
Bell, Stanford chief since October,
1968, said yesterday he resigned
because of a "lack of direction from
the University administration as to the
exact responsibilities of the |Stanford
police] department. He indicated that
the administration had not been happy
with his complaints about this "lack of
direction" and had "initiated these
discussions" with him about his
position on the police department. The
discussions led to his resignation.
According to a University news
release, Bell resigned as a result of
conversations initiated by University
Business Manager Dwight Adams,
March 29, confirmed in writing Friday
April 23, and disclosed to police
department members last weekend. Bell
termed his resignation one of "mutual
agreement" although he emphasized
that discussions were started by the
ad minis tration.

Bell feels that the administration has
offered "no leadership" on police
matters. He is especially unhappy about
the administration's lack of decision in
the past on the possibility of making
the Stanford policeman peace officers
similar to regular police. Currently
Stanford police are not deputized and
only have the powers of citizens. (See
above story .)
Bell complained about the
administration wanting Stanford police
to be "security patrolman one day and
regular deputy the next."
Bell said, "1 would have preferred to
go law enforcement rather than use
outside forces" in many police matters.
Dwight Adams said that the
University has been aware "that he
| Bell | has been unhappy about the
uncertainty of the police department."
However, he indicated that top-level
decision has now been made to submit
legislation at the state level seeking to
make University policeman peace
officers.
