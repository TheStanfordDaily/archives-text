# Failure To Meet Demands
## Many Hospital Workers Walk Out 
### 
Many black workers at Stanford
University Hospital walked off their
jobs yesterday in the first indication of
a long-contemplated work stoppage to
protest the failure of the Hospital
Administration to meet all eleven
minority demands presented earlier this
month.

About 20 pickets marched outside
the Medical Center during the day and
distributed leaflets stating that black
workers voted Friday to stop working
until the administration agrees to meet
all demands.
The Hospital reported that it
received a bomb threat around noon,
the third since police ended the April 9
demonstration in which 23 persons
were arrested.
Hospital officials did not know the
total number of employees who had
walked off; since employees were
scheduled to work different shifts
throughout the day, it was nearly
impossible to make an exact
determination.
Hardest hit by the walkout were the
housekeeping, dietary, diagnostic
radiology, and engineering
departments.
On the morning shift 21 out of 24
blacks and one Chicano walked out of
the housekeeping department, 25 of 40
walked out of the dietary department,
all 15 blacks in diagnostic radiology
left as did all four black workers in the
engineering department.
In the afternoon shift 18 of 34 black
workers walked out of their

housekeeping department jobs, as well
as all four black employees in medical
records.
Many employees simply checked in
and walked out.
There are 317 blacks and 133
Chicanos employed at Stanford
Hospital out of a total of 2,170
employees.
Some May Work
Latin workers at the Hospital
tentatively elected to remain on the job
Monday, and indications were last night
that they may work normally through
the week.
It was not clear if the black
employees' walkout would continue for
the rest of the week.
It was difficult to ascertain specific
leadership in the walkout, several
organizations, including the Black
Liberation Front (BLF), the Alianza
Latina, the Black Advisory Council
(BAC), Venceremos, the Medical
Center Employees Coalition, and others
had discussed a possible job action
during the past week.
"We regret that some employees
have seen fit to stay away from work
today," stated Dr. Thomas A. Gonda,
Director of Stanford University

Hosjital in a release yesterday
afternoon.
"We ask all employees to do their
best in the interest of our patients and
request all employees who have stayed
away to return to work on their next
scheduled shift," continued Gonda.
Gonda's statement stressed that
employees who stay away in support of
a work stoppage will not be paid.
He referred to a flyer distributed
throughout the Hospital Monday
morning which said that employees
engaging in a work stoppage over
grievances cannot be replaced.
Not the Law
"That is not the law," Gonda noted.
"The Hospital has a grievance
procedure. Employees who stay away
from work over grievances can be
legally replaced."
The Hospital Director added: "1
want to emphasize that employees who
stay away from work in support of the
so-called work stoppage will not be
paid for time away from work."
Gonda stated that the Hospital
"remains ready to continue to reach
rational solutions" with the employees,
but "not with disruptive forces who
want to destroy our hospital."

employees who stay away in support of
a work stoppage will not be paid.
He referred to a flyer distributed
throughout the Hospital Monday
morning which said that employees
engaging in a work stoppage over
grievances cannot be replaced.
Not the Law
"That is not the law," Gonda noted.
"The Hospital has a grievance
procedure. Employees who stay away
from work over grievances can be
legally replaced."
The Hospital Director added: "1
want to emphasize that employees who
stay away from work in support of the
so-called work stoppage will not be
paid for time away from work."
Gonda stated that the Hospital
"remains ready to continue to reach
rational solutions" with the employees,
but "not with disruptive forces who
want to destroy our hospital."
Many black workers at Stanford
University Hospital walked off their
jobs yesterday in the first indication of
a long-contemplated work stoppage to
protest the failure of the Hospital
Administration to meet all eleven
minority demands presented earlier this
month.

About 20 pickets marched outside
the Medical Center during the day and
distributed leaflets stating that black
workers voted Friday to stop working
until the administration agrees to meet
all demands.
The Hospital reported that it
received a bomb threat around noon,
the third since police ended the April 9
demonstration in which 23 persons
were arrested.
Hospital officials did not know the
total number of employees who had
walked off; since employees were
scheduled to work different shifts
throughout the day, it was nearly
impossible to make an exact
determination.
Hardest hit by the walkout were the
housekeeping, dietary, diagnostic
radiology, and engineering
departments.
On the morning shift 21 out of 24
blacks and one Chicano walked out of
the housekeeping department, 25 of 40
walked out of the dietary department,
all 15 blacks in diagnostic radiology
left as did all four black workers in the
engineering department.
In the afternoon shift 18 of 34 black
workers walked out of their

housekeeping department jobs, as well
as all four black employees in medical
records.
Many employees simply checked in
and walked out.
There are 317 blacks and 133
Chicanos employed at Stanford
Hospital out of a total of 2,170
employees.
Some May Work
Latin workers at the Hospital
tentatively elected to remain on the job
Monday, and indications were last night
that they may work normally through
the week.
It was not clear if the black
employees' walkout would continue for
the rest of the week.
It was difficult to ascertain specific
leadership in the walkout, several
organizations, including the Black
Liberation Front (BLF), the Alianza
Latina, the Black Advisory Council
(BAC), Venceremos, the Medical
Center Employees Coalition, and others
had discussed a possible job action
during the past week.
"We regret that some employees
have seen fit to stay away from work
today," stated Dr. Thomas A. Gonda,
Director of Stanford University

Hosjital in a release yesterday
afternoon.
"We ask all employees to do their
best in the interest of our patients and
request all employees who have stayed
away to return to work on their next
scheduled shift," continued Gonda.
Gonda's statement stressed that
employees who stay away in support of
a work stoppage will not be paid.
