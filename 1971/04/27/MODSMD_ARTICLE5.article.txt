# Confusion Clouds BAP Cuts

### JIM DEERINGER 
Architects of the Budget
Adjustment Program-Phase II (BAP)
have stated that there will be a
$130,000 cutback in student aid this
aiming year. For most students whose
hearts skip a beat whenever they
receive a letter with Financial Aids
written on the outside, such news has
caused extreme anxiety. They have
visions of getting half-way through
Stanford and being left in the lurch
financially. No such thing is going to
happen, however, according to the
administration. Current financial aid
programs will be extended to cover
next year's higher tuition and room and
board costs, and commitments to
minority programs will be kept.
There will be no cut whatsoever in
graduate student aid programs. There is
widespread misunderstanding of the
effects of BAP on student aid
programs. The allocation in question in
the BAP Phase II budget is only one of
several sources of funds for student aid.
BAP concerns appropriations from the
University general fund. Other sources
of students aid funds are: gifts,
endowed scholarships, and outside
awards such as California State and
National Merit scholarships.
When promoters of BAP point to
the $130,000 "saving" in student aid,
they imply that student aid allocations
will be $130,000 less than they were
last year. Actually, the "cut-back"
refers to the difference between what
the financial aids office requested and
what they will receive. They requested
a $612,000 increase and will receive
from the general fund an increase of
only $482,000. According to Robert P.
Huff, Director of Undergraduate
Financial Aids, "Rarely in the best of

times do we get what we request.
Scholarships for this coming year will
increase, and increase significantly."
Meeting the Deficit
Student aid will be able to keep pace
because the $130,000 "reduction" will
be offset in two ways: by funneling
almost all part-time jobs on campus
through the work-study program
($100,000), and by an expected
increase of $30,000 in outside
scholarships support.
The statement is often made,
"Throwing rocks through windows
takes scholarships away from minority
students." It appears that this is true,
but only indirectly. The $100,000
required to repair broken windows last
year came out of a $5,665,000 cash
reserve or "rainy-day" fund. This
reserve is being depleted at the rate of
$1 million a year, however, and cuts
will have to be taken from other
sources in the near future. Broken

windows, therefore, contribute to the
general financial crisis which will
ultimately be reflected in decreased
scholarship aid.
Reasons for the student aid crunch
are not hard to find. In the last several
years, although income from tuition
has been rising at the rate of 5-6
percent a year, student costs have been
rising 6- 7 percent a year. Furthermore,
the federal government has recently
shifted its aid program to the "more
clearly disadvantaged" depriving the
University of still more funds. These
major factors, combined with a decline
in alumni support and the cost of
campus violence, are making student
aid goals much harder to meet.
Priorities
The administration is very reluctant
to sacrifice student aid in
budget-cutting proposals. As the
University Relations Office states in its
