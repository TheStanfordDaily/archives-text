# Confusion Clouds BAP Cuts
## 
### JIM DEERINGER 
Architects of the Budget
Adjustment Program-Phase II (BAP)
have stated that there will be a
$130,000 cutback in student aid this
aiming year. For most students whose
hearts skip a beat whenever they
receive a letter with Financial Aids
written on the outside, such news has
caused extreme anxiety. They have
visions of getting half-way through
Stanford and being left in the lurch
financially. No such thing is going to
happen, however, according to the
administration. Current financial aid
programs will be extended to cover
next year's higher tuition and room and
board costs, and commitments to
minority programs will be kept.
There will be no cut whatsoever in
graduate student aid programs. There is
widespread misunderstanding of the
effects of BAP on student aid
programs. The allocation in question in
the BAP Phase II budget is only one of
several sources of funds for student aid.
BAP concerns appropriations from the
University general fund. Other sources
of students aid funds are: gifts,
endowed scholarships, and outside
awards such as California State and
National Merit scholarships.
When promoters of BAP point to
the $130,000 "saving" in student aid,
they imply that student aid allocations
will be $130,000 less than they were
last year. Actually, the "cut-back"
refers to the difference between what
the financial aids office requested and
what they will receive. They requested
a $612,000 increase and will receive
from the general fund an increase of
only $482,000. According to Robert P.
Huff, Director of Undergraduate
Financial Aids, "Rarely in the best of

times do we get what we request.
Scholarships for this coming year will
increase, and increase significantly."
Meeting the Deficit
Student aid will be able to keep pace
because the $130,000 "reduction" will
be offset in two ways: by funneling
almost all part-time jobs on campus
through the work-study program
($100,000), and by an expected
increase of $30,000 in outside
scholarships support.
The statement is often made,
"Throwing rocks through windows
takes scholarships away from minority
students." It appears that this is true,
but only indirectly. The $100,000
required to repair broken windows last
year came out of a $5,665,000 cash
reserve or "rainy-day" fund. This
reserve is being depleted at the rate of
$1 million a year, however, and cuts
will have to be taken from other
sources in the near future. Broken

windows, therefore, contribute to the
general financial crisis which will
ultimately be reflected in decreased
scholarship aid.
Reasons for the student aid crunch
are not hard to find. In the last several
years, although income from tuition
has been rising at the rate of 5-6
percent a year, student costs have been
rising 6- 7 percent a year. Furthermore,
the federal government has recently
shifted its aid program to the "more
clearly disadvantaged" depriving the
University of still more funds. These
major factors, combined with a decline
in alumni support and the cost of
campus violence, are making student
aid goals much harder to meet.
Priorities
The administration is very reluctant
to sacrifice student aid in
budget-cutting proposals. As the
University Relations Office states in its
Campus Report Supplement concerning
BAP. "The fact that a reduction was
recommended here — even though the
substitution of other resources
mitigates its effects - reflects the
seriousness of the University's financial
problems." One of the highest priorities
of the University is to maintain a
financial aid program good enough to
allow students to base their major
decisions on factors other than
financial need.
It should be noted, however, that it
takes more than $600,000 each year
just to keep pace with current financial
aid commitments to students. This year
the University was able to mitigate the
effects of the reduced increase in
appropriated funds, but it cannot
continually hope to do so. Further
reductions will undoubtedly force the
student to borrow a greater proportion
of his calculated need.
Mike Roberts, Associate Controller,
states, "I really doubt that we can
continue to divert the kind of cash that

we have in the last couple of years. The
student and his parents are going to
have to assume an increasing amount of
the burden." Students now on financial
aid borrow an average of 20 percent of
their funds.
Bomb Threat
Lathrop House received a false
bomb threat at 12:02 a.m. last night. A
male caller said, "Everybody's involved.
You've got to know we're serious. We
want to give you enough time to get
out, but there's a bomb in Lathrop."
Jeanie Kreysche, Lathrop R.A., had
heard a knock at her door about
midnight. A girl non-resident informed
her that the house phone was ringing.
When Jeanie answered the phone,
the voice informed her of the bomb.
After discussing the call with her
boyfriend, Jeanie immediately
contacted the police and the house was
evacuated. Police and fire authorities
were able to find no bomb.

graduate student aid programs. There is
widespread misunderstanding of the
effects of BAP on student aid
programs. The allocation in question in
the BAP Phase II budget is only one of
several sources of funds for student aid.
BAP concerns appropriations from the
University general fund. Other sources
of students aid funds are: gifts,
endowed scholarships, and outside
awards such as California State and
National Merit scholarships.
When promoters of BAP point to
the $130,000 "saving" in student aid,
they imply that student aid allocations
will be $130,000 less than they were
last year. Actually, the "cut-back"
refers to the difference between what
the financial aids office requested and
what they will receive. They requested
a $612,000 increase and will receive
from the general fund an increase of
only $482,000. According to Robert P.
Huff, Director of Undergraduate
Financial Aids, "Rarely in the best of

times do we get what we request.
Scholarships for this coming year will
increase, and increase significantly."
Meeting the Deficit
Student aid will be able to keep pace
because the $130,000 "reduction" will
be offset in two ways: by funneling
almost all part-time jobs on campus
through the work-study program
($100,000), and by an expected
increase of $30,000 in outside
scholarships support.
The statement is often made,
"Throwing rocks through windows
takes scholarships away from minority
students." It appears that this is true,
but only indirectly. The $100,000
required to repair broken windows last
year came out of a $5,665,000 cash
reserve or "rainy-day" fund. This
reserve is being depleted at the rate of
$1 million a year, however, and cuts
will have to be taken from other
sources in the near future. Broken

windows, therefore, contribute to the
general financial crisis which will
ultimately be reflected in decreased
scholarship aid.
Reasons for the student aid crunch
are not hard to find. In the last several
years, although income from tuition
has been rising at the rate of 5-6
percent a year, student costs have been
rising 6- 7 percent a year. Furthermore,
the federal government has recently
shifted its aid program to the "more
clearly disadvantaged" depriving the
University of still more funds. These
major factors, combined with a decline
in alumni support and the cost of
campus violence, are making student
aid goals much harder to meet.
Priorities
The administration is very reluctant
to sacrifice student aid in
budget-cutting proposals. As the
University Relations Office states in its
Campus Report Supplement concerning
BAP. "The fact that a reduction was
recommended here — even though the
substitution of other resources
mitigates its effects - reflects the
seriousness of the University's financial
problems." One of the highest priorities
of the University is to maintain a
financial aid program good enough to
allow students to base their major
decisions on factors other than
financial need.
It should be noted, however, that it
takes more than $600,000 each year
just to keep pace with current financial
aid commitments to students. This year
the University was able to mitigate the
effects of the reduced increase in
appropriated funds, but it cannot
continually hope to do so. Further
reductions will undoubtedly force the
student to borrow a greater proportion
of his calculated need.
Mike Roberts, Associate Controller,
states, "I really doubt that we can
continue to divert the kind of cash that

we have in the last couple of years. The
student and his parents are going to
have to assume an increasing amount of
the burden." Students now on financial
aid borrow an average of 20 percent of
their funds.
Bomb Threat
Lathrop House received a false
bomb threat at 12:02 a.m. last night. A
male caller said, "Everybody's involved.
You've got to know we're serious. We
want to give you enough time to get
out, but there's a bomb in Lathrop."
Jeanie Kreysche, Lathrop R.A., had
heard a knock at her door about
midnight. A girl non-resident informed
her that the house phone was ringing.
When Jeanie answered the phone,
the voice informed her of the bomb.
After discussing the call with her
boyfriend, Jeanie immediately
contacted the police and the house was
evacuated. Police and fire authorities
were able to find no bomb.
Architects of the Budget
Adjustment Program-Phase II (BAP)
have stated that there will be a
$130,000 cutback in student aid this
aiming year. For most students whose
hearts skip a beat whenever they
receive a letter with Financial Aids
written on the outside, such news has
caused extreme anxiety. They have
visions of getting half-way through
Stanford and being left in the lurch
financially. No such thing is going to
happen, however, according to the
administration. Current financial aid
programs will be extended to cover
next year's higher tuition and room and
board costs, and commitments to
minority programs will be kept.

the financial aids office requested and
what they will receive. They requested
a $612,000 increase and will receive
from the general fund an increase of
only $482,000. According to Robert P.
Huff, Director of Undergraduate
Financial Aids, "Rarely in the best of

times do we get what we request.
Scholarships for this coming year will
increase, and increase significantly."
Meeting the Deficit
Student aid will be able to keep pace
because the $130,000 "reduction" will
be offset in two ways: by funneling
almost all part-time jobs on campus
through the work-study program
($100,000), and by an expected
increase of $30,000 in outside
scholarships support.
The statement is often made,
"Throwing rocks through windows
takes scholarships away from minority
students." It appears that this is true,
but only indirectly. The $100,000
required to repair broken windows last
year came out of a $5,665,000 cash
reserve or "rainy-day" fund. This
reserve is being depleted at the rate of
$1 million a year, however, and cuts
will have to be taken from other
sources in the near future. Broken

windows, therefore, contribute to the
general financial crisis which will
ultimately be reflected in decreased
scholarship aid.
Reasons for the student aid crunch
are not hard to find. In the last several
years, although income from tuition
has been rising at the rate of 5-6
percent a year, student costs have been
rising 6- 7 percent a year. Furthermore,
the federal government has recently
shifted its aid program to the "more
clearly disadvantaged" depriving the
University of still more funds. These
major factors, combined with a decline
in alumni support and the cost of
campus violence, are making student
aid goals much harder to meet.
Priorities
The administration is very reluctant
to sacrifice student aid in
budget-cutting proposals. As the
University Relations Office states in its
Campus Report Supplement concerning
BAP. "The fact that a reduction was
recommended here — even though the
substitution of other resources
mitigates its effects - reflects the
seriousness of the University's financial
problems." One of the highest priorities
of the University is to maintain a
financial aid program good enough to
allow students to base their major
decisions on factors other than
financial need.
It should be noted, however, that it
takes more than $600,000 each year
just to keep pace with current financial
aid commitments to students. This year
the University was able to mitigate the
effects of the reduced increase in
appropriated funds, but it cannot
continually hope to do so. Further
reductions will undoubtedly force the
student to borrow a greater proportion
of his calculated need.
Mike Roberts, Associate Controller,
states, "I really doubt that we can
continue to divert the kind of cash that

we have in the last couple of years. The
student and his parents are going to
have to assume an increasing amount of
the burden." Students now on financial
aid borrow an average of 20 percent of
their funds.
Bomb Threat
Lathrop House received a false
bomb threat at 12:02 a.m. last night. A
male caller said, "Everybody's involved.
You've got to know we're serious. We
want to give you enough time to get
out, but there's a bomb in Lathrop."
Jeanie Kreysche, Lathrop R.A., had
heard a knock at her door about
midnight. A girl non-resident informed
her that the house phone was ringing.
When Jeanie answered the phone,
the voice informed her of the bomb.
After discussing the call with her
boyfriend, Jeanie immediately
contacted the police and the house was
evacuated. Police and fire authorities
were able to find no bomb.
