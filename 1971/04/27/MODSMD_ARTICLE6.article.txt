When the war comes home,
those who are making a career out
of ignoring that war can only
respond with hysteria. This is the
only explanation 1 can find for
the Daily editorial of April 26.
How else can we understand this
sentence: "The blast endangered
the life of at least one person- and
might have killed or injured many
more had it exploded in the
daytime." Yes, and it might have
killed or injured even more people
if it had been an atomic bomb
dropped on White Plaza at noon.
But it wasn't.
The fact is that in all the
revolutionary bombing that has
gone on in this country since the
Weatherman went underground,
there has been only one death, the
graduate student at Wisconsin,

and that was a tragic and
inexcusable mistake which the
bombers apparently did their best
to avoid. It would indeed be
"chilling to realize that human life
is held in as little regard by these
revolutionaries as it is by the men
who shape our policies in
Indochina and the institutions
which support these policies-such
as Stanford University." But that
is not the case.
And what shall we say about
the sensibility which can
characterize the Indochina war as
"the more distant but no less
brutal genocide in Asia"? Is the
killing of over one million people,
the desolation of the land, and the
destruction of three entire
cultures the moral equivalent of
$25,000 damage? Are we all so

brutalized by the war that we can
no longer make any distinctions?
Finally, it is tiresome to
continue to hear from the
children of the white elite that
"violence in one quarter is
seldom, if ever, a cure for violence
in another." Are the Indochinese
people wrong to use violence to
resist the American aggressors?
Were the European Jews right to
submit quietly to genocide? Are
the Black Panthers wrong to shoot
back when the police attack them
as they are working for the
survival of the black communities?
Only people who are protected
from the brutal reality of
imperialism by money, class and
white-skin privilege can answer
these questions of the affirmative.
On April 15 President Lyman

announced that the sit-in was no
longer "acceptable" at Stanford.
One week later his office was
bombed. If peaceful, non-violent
means of protest are cut off, no
one should be surprised if some
people use more violent means
which involve less risk. Those who
disapprove of that violence must
then make a choice.
If they think that the problems
of racism and imperialism at
Stanford can be solved by less
violent means, then they have to
take the risks and use those
means. Otherwise, they tacitly
support the racists and
imperialists. Tortured editorials
don't mean a thing.

only explanation 1 can find for
the Daily editorial of April 26.
How else can we understand this
sentence: "The blast endangered
the life of at least one person- and
might have killed or injured many
more had it exploded in the
daytime." Yes, and it might have
killed or injured even more people
if it had been an atomic bomb
dropped on White Plaza at noon.
But it wasn't.
The fact is that in all the
revolutionary bombing that has
gone on in this country since the
Weatherman went underground,
there has been only one death, the
graduate student at Wisconsin,

and that was a tragic and
inexcusable mistake which the
bombers apparently did their best
to avoid. It would indeed be
"chilling to realize that human life
is held in as little regard by these
revolutionaries as it is by the men
who shape our policies in
Indochina and the institutions
which support these policies-such
as Stanford University." But that
is not the case.
And what shall we say about
the sensibility which can
characterize the Indochina war as
"the more distant but no less
brutal genocide in Asia"? Is the
killing of over one million people,
the desolation of the land, and the
destruction of three entire
cultures the moral equivalent of
$25,000 damage? Are we all so

brutalized by the war that we can
no longer make any distinctions?
Finally, it is tiresome to
continue to hear from the
children of the white elite that
"violence in one quarter is
seldom, if ever, a cure for violence
in another." Are the Indochinese
people wrong to use violence to
resist the American aggressors?
Were the European Jews right to
submit quietly to genocide? Are
the Black Panthers wrong to shoot
back when the police attack them
as they are working for the
survival of the black communities?
Only people who are protected
from the brutal reality of
imperialism by money, class and
white-skin privilege can answer
these questions of the affirmative.
On April 15 President Lyman

announced that the sit-in was no
longer "acceptable" at Stanford.
One week later his office was
bombed. If peaceful, non-violent
means of protest are cut off, no
one should be surprised if some
people use more violent means
which involve less risk. Those who
disapprove of that violence must
then make a choice.
If they think that the problems
of racism and imperialism at
Stanford can be solved by less
violent means, then they have to
take the risks and use those
means. Otherwise, they tacitly
support the racists and
imperialists. Tortured editorials
don't mean a thing.

When the war comes home,
those who are making a career out
of ignoring that war can only
respond with hysteria. This is the
