# Films Rely On Screenplays
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
What merit "A New Leaf" and
"Little Murders" have lies largely
in the films' dependence upon the
inherent virtues of their
screenplays. It's a relief to be able
to praise a script, for in these days
of directorial dictatorship and
alleged visual virtuosity the role of
the writer seems to have sunk into
oblivion without possible hope of
resurrection.
Neither film is particularly well
directed and both are rather
unusual in their preoccupations,
but I think "A New Leaf"
succeeds as much as "Little
Murders" fails in living up to what
it promises.
"A New Leaf" distinguishes
itself as a real rarity in films
today-a true aristocratic comedy.
It deals only with the very very
rich and the comedic contrivances
in the film are of a sort that can
only encumber people who have
nothing else to do.
Off-hand, I can't think of any
film since "The Graduate" which
has been so delightfully neglectful
of contemporary social problems
and no film comedy since the late
thirties which has dealt
exclusively with the country club
set. That "A New Leaf" is so out
of whack with most current
products emerges as one of its
principle pleasures.
Studio Interference
One of the current
semi-scandals of the film industry
is that "A New Leaf" was taken
out of the hands of

actress-writer-director Elaine May
in the final stages of preparation
and re-cut by the Robert Evans
regime at Paramount. This action
has been protested by a number
of directors including Arthur Penn
and though there is no way of
knowing which version is better,
such studio interference must be
objected to on principle. The final
version holds together pretty well
and I doubt if 1 could have
fathomed the three hours that was
apparently Miss May's cut.
Despite the hatchet job, 1
couldn't detect any glaring gaps in
the narrative. However, the pace
of the film decelerates towards
the end and the denouement is
something of a predictable
disappointment. Walter Matthau
and Elaine are both quite fine and
perhaps my major objection to
the film is not only to the
pathetic color quality, but the use
of color itself.
Director May may have been
able to return us to the thirties in
spirit, but mandatory modern
technology has ruined the
provocative illusion that an escape
from seventies slickness is possible
within the omnipotent Hollywood
corporate superstructure.
"Little Murders" Diminished
The ultimate effectiveness of
"Little Murders" has been
diminished in the transition from
stage to screen to the point where
I'd call the play a rousing success
and the film a regrettable
let-down. Much of Jules Feiffer's
work remains extremely funny
and the first half of the movie is

actually a minor triumph. I
remember few films, however,
that seemed to promise so much
and ultimately delivered so little.
The opening scenes are
chillingly good, as the courtship
of "apathist" Elliott Gould and
aggressive Marcia Rodd is played
out against a background of
impending holocaust and doom.
Indeed, almost everything moves
along well until the assassination
of Miss Rodd halfway through the
film. Miss Rodd (who was
delightful both off and on
Broadway in "Your Own Thing"
and "Last of the Red Hot
Lovers") had been the motivating
force behind the film from the
opening shot, and with her death
no energy seems to remain in the
picture but nervous energy.
What's more, the expansion of
Elliott Gould'sblob character into
a starring role doesn't help the
second half either, as either he or
no one must carry the film after
Marcia's gone.
Claustrophobia Lost
Much of the claustrophobic
quality which was so important to
the work onstage has been lost by
"opening up" the action for the
screen. As long as the film
confines itself within apartment
walls, the illusion of street warfare
as the rule rather than the
exception is effectively sustained.
However, when Gould walks
through a relatively tranquil
Central Park, the disturbed world
that Feiffer and director Alan
Arkin have tried to create for us
becomes aesthetically confused

and inconsistent, despite the
notorious reputation Central Park
maintains even today.
I'd be the last to dispute New
York's claim to the title of
paranoia capital of the world, but
the impressionistic description of
conditions there that Feiffer made
so frighteningly relevant onstage
have not been adapted to the
screen with sufficient consistence
or artfulness.
