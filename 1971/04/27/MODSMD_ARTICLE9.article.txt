# Venceremos Condemns Arson Attack On Dorm
## 
### 
Stanford members of Venceremos in
their first public meeting this year
condemned the arson attack on
Junipero Lounge. In a statement
released last night they said, "We
categorically deny that we were in any
way involved with the fire, and we
denounce the administrations attempts
to connect us with it.
"We denounce this attack as a
right-wing attack on the people.
Venceremos attacks the violence of the
Man against People. We do not attack
the people."
The more than 200 persons
attending heard speeches for two hours
and then broke into affinity groups to
"organize the dorms and community,
and to prepare support for striking
black hospital workers."
Mike Dawson, co-chairman of the
Black Student's Union, told the group,
"the struggle of the Black community
is the struggle of the whole community.

We want to give the white community a
chance to decide where it stands on the
black demands... If nobody else
carries it on, we will."
Dawson also called for a chance for
the Stanford Community to vote
against specific racist policies.
"If it votes yes," he said, "the
administration will have to comply -
if no, then this school is so sick it no
longer should function."
Linda Crouse, a Stanford worker,
announced that the radical labor group,
United Stanford Employees, will
support the black walkout with a
one-day work stoppage of its own
today. She also appealed to students to
support both efforts with food and
money.
Other suggestions of possible actions
for the group included joining picket
lines, preparing "guerilla theatre" for
ROTC cadets, "beautifying Hoover
Institute" with paint and posters, and
organizing dorms and the community.
