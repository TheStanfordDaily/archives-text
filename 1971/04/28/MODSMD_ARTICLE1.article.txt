# Hospital Workers Return To Jobs
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
Most black Stanford University
Hospital workers who walked off their
jobs Monday returned to work
yesterday, partially in response to the
memorandum issued Monday by
Hospital Director, Dr. Thomas A.
Gonda, stating that employees who
stay away from their jobs can be legally
replaced.
The walkout, called Friday in - a
meeting of black hospital employees to
protest the failure of the administration
to meet all 11 minority demands, was
termed "successful" by James
Cheatham and Mel Barres, both
members of the Hospital's Black
Advisory Council (BAC).
"We do not wish to endanger patient
care at the Hospital, and workers will
be back on the job Wednesday," noted
their statement issued yesterday,
endorsed, according to a member of the
original workers' negotiating team, by
the majority of black hospital workers.
The statement also urged the
administration to "enter into faithful
negotiations with our duly elected
negotiating team immediately."
Hospital officials made some new
overtures last night towards resuming
negotiations when Gonda, in a
memorandum, stated that "the
administration is prepared to resume
meetings with any group of employees
on any hospital-related issue."
Legitimacy Not Recognized
However, Gonda's statement was
somewhat clarified in terms of previous
hospital administration stances on the
composition of worker negotiating
teams.
The Hospital, in the past week, has
stated that it does not recognize the
legitimacy of worker negotiating teams
partially composed of non-Hospital
employees.
Various workers' statements, in
turn, have declared that the workers
will not accept the administration's
rigid definition of their negotiating
team: that the workers' team should be
composed only of Hospital employees
and their 'legal advisors,' (in the words
of Acting Dean John L. Wilson of the
School of Medicine).
The Hospital, said Gonda last night,
"will negotiate Hospital-related issues

only with groups that can demonstrate
they actually represent the employees
who would be affected by agreements
reached in the negotiations."
According to a spokesman in the
Medical Center News Service, the
negotiations Gonda referred to are
towards establishing a representative
employee council "with which it can
consult on issues affecting the hospital
employees."
Gonda again stated last night that
the Hospital does not recognize the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition "as an appropriate bargaining
unit nor their representatives as
negotiators."
The original elected worker
negotiating team, which met only once
with Hospital officials, was composed
of Ida Berk, member of United
Stanford Employees (USE); John T.
Wilson, M.D. of the Medical Center;
Jim Cheatham of the BAC; Martha
Mitchell, a University employee; Chris
Lowry, of the Black Liberation Front
(BLF); and Mel Barres, of the BAC.
Employee Representatives?
Gonda declared Monday that the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition does not "represent the
minority employees of Stanford
University Hospital."
The Coalition, however, contends
that it does represent the minority
workers. It appears to include members
of the various groups who have
protested and demonstrated against
Hospital practices and policies in the
past weeks.
"This group," said Gonda Monday,
"claims to represent a self-defined
'coalition' that includes some minority
employees of the Hospital and
University but also a large number of
non-minority and minority individuals
who are not University or Hospital
employees."
'Intransigence' Continues
The Coalition declared Saturday
that the Hospital's 'intransigence'
"continues in spite of petitions signed
by Hospital workers and the efforts of
a delegation from a meeting of faculty
and housestaff (from the Department
of Medicine), urging tht administration
to begin negotiations imnu iiately with
the Coalitions' chosen negotiators."

The Coalition's "chosen
negotiators" compose the six-member
team already elected by the workers; it
maintains that the team must be
accepted as legitimate by the Hospital
administration.
According to Ida Berk, of the
original worker-elected negotiating
team, the strike was almost a product
of the stalemate between the workers
and the administration.
"Worker concern mounted day after
day since the sit-in," she commented,
"And every day the negotiations were
aborted by the administration, the
frustrations of the workers grew."
Difficult Situation
"The strike was decided by general
agreement of the workers on Friday. It
was not a unanimous agreement, but
more the working out of a difficult
situation. The people simply decided to
do as much as they could do," she
declared.
Most of the black workers on the
Monday morning shift walked out of
their jobs. More employees did work on
the afternoon shift but less than 30
percent of the black workers showed
up for the day.
Most workers returned to their jobs
yesterday. A total of 71 blacks out of
107 reported for work. While none of

the 15 blacks in diagnostic radiology
worked Monday, all but one black in
the morning shift reported in
yesterday.
In the dietary department, where no
blacks showed up Monday, 14 of 20
did yesterday. The Housekeeping
department was slowest to return to
normal operations; only 3 of 24 black
workers showed Monday, and 11 of 26
worked yesterday.
Latin workers, who did not vote to
walk out Monday, were again almost
100 percent on duty yesterday.
About 15-20 pickets from United
Stanford Employees passed out leaflets
outside the Medical Center all day
yesterday.
Apparently Gonda's Monday
statement that workers who engage in a
work stoppage over grievances can
legally be replaced provided much of
the impetus for the return to work.
A statement distributed by USE
outside the Hospital yesterday declared
that "federal law does protect your job
when you strike over an unfair labor
practice like firing Sam Bridges for
organizing Hospital workers- but
everybody knows you cannot depend
on the Courts to protect your job, and
most workers know that it is only
because workers protect each other
that they have any security."

negotiations when Gonda, in a
memorandum, stated that "the
administration is prepared to resume
meetings with any group of employees
on any hospital-related issue."
Legitimacy Not Recognized
However, Gonda's statement was
somewhat clarified in terms of previous
hospital administration stances on the
composition of worker negotiating
teams.
The Hospital, in the past week, has
stated that it does not recognize the
legitimacy of worker negotiating teams
partially composed of non-Hospital
employees.
Various workers' statements, in
turn, have declared that the workers
will not accept the administration's
rigid definition of their negotiating
team: that the workers' team should be
composed only of Hospital employees
and their 'legal advisors,' (in the words
of Acting Dean John L. Wilson of the
School of Medicine).
The Hospital, said Gonda last night,
"will negotiate Hospital-related issues

only with groups that can demonstrate
they actually represent the employees
who would be affected by agreements
reached in the negotiations."
According to a spokesman in the
Medical Center News Service, the
negotiations Gonda referred to are
towards establishing a representative
employee council "with which it can
consult on issues affecting the hospital
employees."
Gonda again stated last night that
the Hospital does not recognize the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition "as an appropriate bargaining
unit nor their representatives as
negotiators."
The original elected worker
negotiating team, which met only once
with Hospital officials, was composed
of Ida Berk, member of United
Stanford Employees (USE); John T.
Wilson, M.D. of the Medical Center;
Jim Cheatham of the BAC; Martha
Mitchell, a University employee; Chris
Lowry, of the Black Liberation Front
(BLF); and Mel Barres, of the BAC.
Employee Representatives?
Gonda declared Monday that the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition does not "represent the
minority employees of Stanford
University Hospital."
The Coalition, however, contends
that it does represent the minority
workers. It appears to include members
of the various groups who have
protested and demonstrated against
Hospital practices and policies in the
past weeks.
"This group," said Gonda Monday,
"claims to represent a self-defined
'coalition' that includes some minority
employees of the Hospital and
University but also a large number of
non-minority and minority individuals
who are not University or Hospital
employees."
'Intransigence' Continues
The Coalition declared Saturday
that the Hospital's 'intransigence'
"continues in spite of petitions signed
by Hospital workers and the efforts of
a delegation from a meeting of faculty
and housestaff (from the Department
of Medicine), urging tht administration
to begin negotiations imnu iiately with
the Coalitions' chosen negotiators."

The Coalition's "chosen
negotiators" compose the six-member
team already elected by the workers; it
maintains that the team must be
accepted as legitimate by the Hospital
administration.
According to Ida Berk, of the
original worker-elected negotiating
team, the strike was almost a product
of the stalemate between the workers
and the administration.
"Worker concern mounted day after
day since the sit-in," she commented,
"And every day the negotiations were
aborted by the administration, the
frustrations of the workers grew."
Difficult Situation
"The strike was decided by general
agreement of the workers on Friday. It
was not a unanimous agreement, but
more the working out of a difficult
situation. The people simply decided to
do as much as they could do," she
declared.
Most of the black workers on the
Monday morning shift walked out of
their jobs. More employees did work on
the afternoon shift but less than 30
percent of the black workers showed
up for the day.
Most workers returned to their jobs
yesterday. A total of 71 blacks out of
107 reported for work. While none of

the 15 blacks in diagnostic radiology
worked Monday, all but one black in
the morning shift reported in
yesterday.
In the dietary department, where no
blacks showed up Monday, 14 of 20
did yesterday. The Housekeeping
department was slowest to return to
normal operations; only 3 of 24 black
workers showed Monday, and 11 of 26
worked yesterday.
Latin workers, who did not vote to
walk out Monday, were again almost
100 percent on duty yesterday.
About 15-20 pickets from United
Stanford Employees passed out leaflets
outside the Medical Center all day
yesterday.
Apparently Gonda's Monday
statement that workers who engage in a
work stoppage over grievances can
legally be replaced provided much of
the impetus for the return to work.
A statement distributed by USE
outside the Hospital yesterday declared
that "federal law does protect your job
when you strike over an unfair labor
practice like firing Sam Bridges for
organizing Hospital workers- but
everybody knows you cannot depend
on the Courts to protect your job, and
most workers know that it is only
because workers protect each other
that they have any security."

Medical Center News Service, the
negotiations Gonda referred to are
towards establishing a representative
employee council "with which it can
consult on issues affecting the hospital
employees."
Gonda again stated last night that
the Hospital does not recognize the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition "as an appropriate bargaining
unit nor their representatives as
negotiators."
The original elected worker
negotiating team, which met only once
with Hospital officials, was composed
of Ida Berk, member of United
Stanford Employees (USE); John T.
Wilson, M.D. of the Medical Center;
Jim Cheatham of the BAC; Martha
Mitchell, a University employee; Chris
Lowry, of the Black Liberation Front
(BLF); and Mel Barres, of the BAC.
Employee Representatives?
Gonda declared Monday that the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition does not "represent the
minority employees of Stanford
University Hospital."
The Coalition, however, contends
that it does represent the minority
workers. It appears to include members
of the various groups who have
protested and demonstrated against
Hospital practices and policies in the
past weeks.
"This group," said Gonda Monday,
"claims to represent a self-defined
'coalition' that includes some minority
employees of the Hospital and
University but also a large number of
non-minority and minority individuals
who are not University or Hospital
employees."
'Intransigence' Continues
The Coalition declared Saturday
that the Hospital's 'intransigence'
"continues in spite of petitions signed
by Hospital workers and the efforts of
a delegation from a meeting of faculty
and housestaff (from the Department
of Medicine), urging tht administration
to begin negotiations imnu iiately with
the Coalitions' chosen negotiators."

The Coalition's "chosen
negotiators" compose the six-member
team already elected by the workers; it
maintains that the team must be
accepted as legitimate by the Hospital
administration.
According to Ida Berk, of the
original worker-elected negotiating
team, the strike was almost a product
of the stalemate between the workers
and the administration.
"Worker concern mounted day after
day since the sit-in," she commented,
"And every day the negotiations were
aborted by the administration, the
frustrations of the workers grew."
Difficult Situation
"The strike was decided by general
agreement of the workers on Friday. It
was not a unanimous agreement, but
more the working out of a difficult
situation. The people simply decided to
do as much as they could do," she
declared.
Most of the black workers on the
Monday morning shift walked out of
their jobs. More employees did work on
the afternoon shift but less than 30
percent of the black workers showed
up for the day.
Most workers returned to their jobs
yesterday. A total of 71 blacks out of
107 reported for work. While none of

the 15 blacks in diagnostic radiology
worked Monday, all but one black in
the morning shift reported in
yesterday.
In the dietary department, where no
blacks showed up Monday, 14 of 20
did yesterday. The Housekeeping
department was slowest to return to
normal operations; only 3 of 24 black
workers showed Monday, and 11 of 26
worked yesterday.
Latin workers, who did not vote to
walk out Monday, were again almost
100 percent on duty yesterday.
About 15-20 pickets from United
Stanford Employees passed out leaflets
outside the Medical Center all day
yesterday.
Apparently Gonda's Monday
statement that workers who engage in a
work stoppage over grievances can
legally be replaced provided much of
the impetus for the return to work.
A statement distributed by USE
outside the Hospital yesterday declared
that "federal law does protect your job
when you strike over an unfair labor
practice like firing Sam Bridges for
organizing Hospital workers- but
everybody knows you cannot depend
on the Courts to protect your job, and
most workers know that it is only
because workers protect each other
that they have any security."

Most black Stanford University
Hospital workers who walked off their
jobs Monday returned to work
yesterday, partially in response to the
memorandum issued Monday by
Hospital Director, Dr. Thomas A.
Gonda, stating that employees who
stay away from their jobs can be legally
replaced.
The walkout, called Friday in - a
meeting of black hospital employees to
protest the failure of the administration
to meet all 11 minority demands, was
termed "successful" by James
Cheatham and Mel Barres, both
members of the Hospital's Black
Advisory Council (BAC).
"We do not wish to endanger patient
care at the Hospital, and workers will
be back on the job Wednesday," noted
their statement issued yesterday,
endorsed, according to a member of the
original workers' negotiating team, by
the majority of black hospital workers.
The statement also urged the
administration to "enter into faithful
negotiations with our duly elected
negotiating team immediately."
Hospital officials made some new
overtures last night towards resuming
negotiations when Gonda, in a
memorandum, stated that "the
administration is prepared to resume
meetings with any group of employees
on any hospital-related issue."
Legitimacy Not Recognized
However, Gonda's statement was
somewhat clarified in terms of previous
hospital administration stances on the
composition of worker negotiating
teams.
The Hospital, in the past week, has
stated that it does not recognize the
legitimacy of worker negotiating teams
partially composed of non-Hospital
employees.
Various workers' statements, in
turn, have declared that the workers
will not accept the administration's
rigid definition of their negotiating
team: that the workers' team should be
composed only of Hospital employees
and their 'legal advisors,' (in the words
of Acting Dean John L. Wilson of the
School of Medicine).
The Hospital, said Gonda last night,
"will negotiate Hospital-related issues

only with groups that can demonstrate
they actually represent the employees
who would be affected by agreements
reached in the negotiations."
According to a spokesman in the
Medical Center News Service, the
negotiations Gonda referred to are
towards establishing a representative
employee council "with which it can
consult on issues affecting the hospital
employees."
Gonda again stated last night that
the Hospital does not recognize the
Stanford Medical Center Employees
Coalition "as an appropriate bargaining
