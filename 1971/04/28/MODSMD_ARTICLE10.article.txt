## Netmen Advance In Cal State 
### TOM QUINN 
In the California State Tennis
Championships at Alpine Hills,
the Stanford team has done
exceptionally and swept almost
every event in which it entered a
participant. With the fourth round
beginning tomorrow, nine
Stanford team players and Chuck
Darley of the Grad School have
advanced into the fourth round.
In fact, the later rounds of the
tournament will probably result in
many head-to-head confrontations
among Stanford teammates.
The Indians' two top players
Roscoe Tanner, seeded fifth, and
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, seeded
thirteenth, haven't even played a
match yet, but begin their play
this afternoon. Tanner will face
Chris Chapin of the Stanford team
who has beaten Jeremy Cohen,
Dick Skeen, and Tom Tucker to
reach the fourth bracket. Mayer
takes on Rodney Kop of
Sunnyvale, also in the afternoon.
The ohter starters on the
varisty have had little trouble
advancing though the first three
rounds while beating some of the
top foreign pros and in Rick
Fisher's case, his own brother.
After initial rough going, Stan
Pasarell flew past John Penero,
Robert Gold, and John Horn, and
will face sixth-seeded Bob Alloo.
Gery Groslimond had easy going,
including a 6-5, 6-2 win over
teammate Tim Noonan, and will
face Bob Potthast, the tenth seed.
Paul Sidone numbered among

Collas, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, and will face

in what was the finest of
yesterday's matches, to earn the

In other competition, Rick
Evans, John Levin, and Chris
Chapin have breezed through
without losing even a set. Evans
was able to upset Canadian Davis
Cupper Peter Burwash, 6-3, 7-6.
Darley, though not a team
member, has nevertheless

advanced without too much
difficulty, but will probably be
slowed down when he faces Jeff
Borowiak, UCLA's number one
singles player, or eighth-seeded
Whitney Reed today.
Some of the top players in
California will begin play
tomorrow, also. As an indication
of the quality of the tournament,
Borowiak is seeded only third
behind Jim McManus and Barry
MacKay. Mac Kay was the winner
of the men's singles last year and

this afternoon.
In the California State Tennis
Championships at Alpine Hills,
the Stanford team has done
exceptionally and swept almost
every event in which it entered a
participant. With the fourth round
beginning tomorrow, nine
Stanford team players and Chuck
Darley of the Grad School have
advanced into the fourth round.
In fact, the later rounds of the
tournament will probably result in
many head-to-head confrontations
among Stanford teammates.
The Indians' two top players
Roscoe Tanner, seeded fifth, and
Alex "Sandy" Mayer, seeded
thirteenth, haven't even played a
match yet, but begin their play
this afternoon. Tanner will face
Chris Chapin of the Stanford team
who has beaten Jeremy Cohen,
Dick Skeen, and Tom Tucker to
reach the fourth bracket. Mayer
takes on Rodney Kop of
Sunnyvale, also in the afternoon.
The ohter starters on the
varisty have had little trouble
advancing though the first three
rounds while beating some of the
top foreign pros and in Rick
Fisher's case, his own brother.
After initial rough going, Stan
Pasarell flew past John Penero,
Robert Gold, and John Horn, and
will face sixth-seeded Bob Alloo.
Gery Groslimond had easy going,
including a 6-5, 6-2 win over
teammate Tim Noonan, and will
face Bob Potthast, the tenth seed.
Paul Sidone numbered among

his victims Peruvian pro Leoncio
Collas, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, and will face
fourth-seeded Tom Leonard. Rick
Fisher had to knock off his own
brother, Chip Fisher, 7-6, 6-7, 7-6,
in what was the finest of
yesterday's matches, to earn the
right to face Rick Anderson.
In other competition, Rick
Evans, John Levin, and Chris
Chapin have breezed through
without losing even a set. Evans
was able to upset Canadian Davis
Cupper Peter Burwash, 6-3, 7-6.
Darley, though not a team
member, has nevertheless

advanced without too much
difficulty, but will probably be
slowed down when he faces Jeff
Borowiak, UCLA's number one
singles player, or eighth-seeded
Whitney Reed today.
Some of the top players in
California will begin play
tomorrow, also. As an indication
of the quality of the tournament,
Borowiak is seeded only third
behind Jim McManus and Barry
MacKay. Mac Kay was the winner
of the men's singles last year and
McManus captured the title in
1968.
