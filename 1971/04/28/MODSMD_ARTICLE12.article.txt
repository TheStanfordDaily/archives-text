# Women Face Stiff Competition
## 
### 
Stanford will host the 9th
Annual Northern California
Women's Intercollegiate Tennis
Tournament this Friday and
Saturday.
The tournament was won last
year at San Jose State by the
Stanford women who will attempt
to defend their title in all day
competition on the varsity, JV,
and women's tennis courts this
weekend.
Martha Downing won the
singles championship last year for
the Indians, and Anne Hill and
Molly Greene combined to
capture the first doubles title.
Both Hill and Greene have
returned this year to compete for
Coach Curly Neal, but Miss
Downing has graduated.
Sally Ride, Maureen O'Keefe,
Susan Mosely, and Terry Albert
will join Misses Hill and Greene in
this year's tournament for
Stanford.
Other teams taking part in the
championship will be Stanislaus
State, Sacramento State, UC
Davis, Humboldt State, Chico
State, University of Pacific,
Sonoma State, San Francisco
State, Mills College, and Cal State
Hay ward.
The field of sixteen squads will
be rounded out by Dominican

College, Fresno State, San Jose
State, University of Santa Clara,
University of California at
Berkeley, and Stanford.
Susan Mosely is warming up
for this weekend's tourney by
competing in the singles and
doubles divisions in the Cal State
Championships being held this
week at Alpine Hills.
Women's Intercollegiate
Championship play will run from
9-5 on both Friday and Saturday.
