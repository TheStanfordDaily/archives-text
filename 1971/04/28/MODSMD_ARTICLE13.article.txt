# Laxmen Cruise Past S.F., 6-4., Prepare For Colorado Series
## 
### 
Stanford's lacrosse squad
registered its fifth victory of the
season last Saturday by
outclassing a hapless San
Francisco Lacrosse Club 6-4, in
Oakland. The game was lackluster
in most aspects, but the Indians
were always in complete control
as goalie Fred Choate turned in
his best game of the season and

thwarted 20 San Francisco
attempts.
The Indians drew first blood as
Stu Charles scored one of his two
goals late in the first period. In
the second quarter defenseman
Rod Lewis tallied quickly on the
breakaway to increase the
Stanford lead to 2-0. Two scores
by Ted Suen capped the second
quarter scoring and left San
Francisco scoreless for a half.
Then Stanford shifted into low
gear in the second half and let San
Francisco blast Choate with four
goals. Fortunately, Charles's
second goal and a tally by Butch
Hazlett provided the winning
margin in the 6-4 victory.
Saturday's victory provided
only partial solace for last
Wednesday's 11-7 defeat at the
hands of Cal Berkeley. The Bears
grabbed the first of a two game
series for the Abercrombie and
Fitch Broken Stick Trophy by
overwhelming the Indians with a
five goal fourth quarter.

Stanford had managed to stay
close and tie the game numerous
times in the see-saw battle, but an
Indian letdown after a disputed
call allowed Cal to score three
quick goals. The extra goals were
costly since the team with the
best two game total of goals wins
the trophy. The Cal victory also
strengthened its chances for the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association championship in its
battle with Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club, and, at the same time,
doomed Stanford to a finish no
better than third.
This weekend Stanford heads
east to Denver to meet Colorado
College and the University of
Denver. Coach Bill Eakland has no
scouting reports on Colorado, but
the team has played Denver the
past four years. Denver holds a
3-1 edge in the series and beat the
Indians 10-6 last year but in
competition against Air Force this
year, Denver was blitzed, 11-3,
while Stanford only lost 6-3 to
the Cadets.

times in the see-saw battle, but an
Indian letdown after a disputed
call allowed Cal to score three
quick goals. The extra goals were
costly since the team with the
best two game total of goals wins
the trophy. The Cal victory also
strengthened its chances for the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association championship in its
battle with Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club, and, at the same time,
doomed Stanford to a finish no
better than third.
This weekend Stanford heads
east to Denver to meet Colorado
College and the University of
Denver. Coach Bill Eakland has no
scouting reports on Colorado, but
the team has played Denver the
past four years. Denver holds a
3-1 edge in the series and beat the
Indians 10-6 last year but in
competition against Air Force this
year, Denver was blitzed, 11-3,
while Stanford only lost 6-3 to
the Cadets.

ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON—Stanford's Ted Suen harasses an opposing goalie earlier in the
season much as he did Saturday against San Francisco while registering two goals in the 6-4 Stanford
victory. The laxmen travel to Denver this weekend to face Colorado College and Denver University in
quest of their sixth and seventh victories.
