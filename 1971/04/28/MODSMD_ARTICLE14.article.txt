Racism Attacked
Monday morning's fire in the Junipero house
lounge was a racist attack against Blacks, according to
Willie L. Newberry, Chairman of Stanford's Black
Students Union (BSU).
In a statement issued yesterday, Newberry said
that the fire was "part and parcel of the atmosphere
of terror and violence that the Stanford
administration has perpetrated by its deceitful and
violent attack on peaceful demonstrators in the
recent Medical Center incident."
He took note of the fact that the BSU had held its
meetings in the now-destroyed lounge, and blamed
"mad-dog racists that seek to exploit this
administration-generated anarchy" for the fire.
He announced that the BSU would hold a rally at
noon today in White Plaza to demand that "the
Stanford administration quell the racist storm it has
generated, protect the lives of Black students and
employees, and meet all Black Reparation Demands."
Peru Trip Slated
At least ten students will go to Peru this summer
to help reconstruct the earthquake-stricken
community of Carhauz in the High Andes province of
Ancash.
The project will be the outgrowth of a course in
planning community reconstruction, co-sponsored by
the Department of Industrial Engineering and
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues).
Seventeen students are taking the course for credit
and nearly 40 more are attending out of personal
interest, reported Roy E. Lave, associate professor of
industrial engineering, who teaches the course.
Funding for the project is being sought from
foundations and industry, said Professor Lave. A
benefit dinner will be held at Tresidder Union on
Thursday, May 13, to help raise money for the
summer portion of the program.

Three more faculty members were elected to the
National Academy of Sciences, it was announced here
yesterday.
Those elected were Prof. Allan M. Campbell of the
Biological Sciences Department; Prof. Marvin
Chodorow, chairman of the Applied Physics
Department and director of the Microwave
Laboratory; and Prof. George B. Dantzig of the
Operations Research and Computer Science
Departments.

lounge was a racist attack against Blacks, according to
Willie L. Newberry, Chairman of Stanford's Black
Students Union (BSU).
In a statement issued yesterday, Newberry said
that the fire was "part and parcel of the atmosphere
of terror and violence that the Stanford
administration has perpetrated by its deceitful and
violent attack on peaceful demonstrators in the
recent Medical Center incident."
He took note of the fact that the BSU had held its
meetings in the now-destroyed lounge, and blamed
"mad-dog racists that seek to exploit this
administration-generated anarchy" for the fire.
He announced that the BSU would hold a rally at
noon today in White Plaza to demand that "the
Stanford administration quell the racist storm it has
generated, protect the lives of Black students and
employees, and meet all Black Reparation Demands."
Peru Trip Slated
At least ten students will go to Peru this summer
to help reconstruct the earthquake-stricken
community of Carhauz in the High Andes province of
Ancash.
The project will be the outgrowth of a course in
planning community reconstruction, co-sponsored by
the Department of Industrial Engineering and
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops on Political and Social
Issues).
Seventeen students are taking the course for credit
and nearly 40 more are attending out of personal
interest, reported Roy E. Lave, associate professor of
industrial engineering, who teaches the course.
Funding for the project is being sought from
foundations and industry, said Professor Lave. A
benefit dinner will be held at Tresidder Union on
Thursday, May 13, to help raise money for the
summer portion of the program.

Pass-Fail At GSB
The Graduate School of Business will give grades
of Honors (H), Pass (P) or Unsatisfactory (U) in place
of the present A, B, C, D, or F grading system, the
School's faculty has decided.
The simplified grading system, which will go into
effect with Autumn Quarter 1971, will also include
plus or minus distinctions for the passing grade.

problems existing within the present system.
