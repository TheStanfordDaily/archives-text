# Senate Certifies Presidential Vote, Organizes Summer Government
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The ASSU Senate last night certified
the election of the new ASSU Council
of Presidents and passed legislation
creating a Summer Quarter Student
government.
The new bylaw provides for a
Committee of the Senate in which is
vested the finaJ representative authority
of Associated Students until the full
Senate reconvenes in the Fall.
An amendment to another by-law,
also passed at yesterday's session,
empowers the Committee to make
interim appointments to committees on
which the Association is represented.
Such appointmments would be in
effect until their terms expire, or until
the Senate confirms an appointment
through the regular procedure.

Doug McHenry twice received the
approval of the Senate last night. Early
in the meeting, the election of the
McHenry-Fields-Diamond-Kimball slate
as ASSU presidents was certified
despite a walkout by conservative
senators.
Later, the legislators approved his
by-law amendment to allow the ASSU
President and Vice-President to appoint
representatives to serve in their stead
on all committees where the
Constitution or By-Laws have either as
a member.
The Senate also approved a
proposition, to appear on the ballot of
the next general election this spring,
which provides for an assessment of
one dollar per student per quarter next
year for the use of Legal Offense. The

funds would be used, "to take the
initiative in legal and quasi-legal matters
affecting the Stanford community or to
help members of this community
obtain legal assistance. The proposition
must be approved by the student body.
The later proposal legitimizes a
procedure which has already been
practised by past ASSU presidents. The
bill was interpreted as meaning that the
President or Vice-president could
assume his seat on the committee at his
discretion.
Most present at the meeting believe
the conservative walkout was designed
not only to break a quorum, which it
failed to do, but also to prevent the
Senate from overriding the veto by Pat
Shea of a bill passed at the April 13
meeting.
That bill proposed a $5000 loan
from the ASSU reserves to the ASSU
bail fund. It would have taken 21
affirmative votes to override the veto.
As only 21 senators, the bare quorum,
were present, the bill's proponents did
not attempt that action.
