# Administration Committee Seeks To Limit Dean Napier's Control Of Chapel Scheduling
## 
### ROBIN STICKNEY 
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel,
may be losing his jurisdiction over
Memorial Church.
The University Committee on Public
Events (COPE) has recommended to
President Lyman that a committee be
established "to take responsibility for
the use of Memorial Church by other
than the Chaplain and the Dean of the
Chapel."
At present, Napier has full
jurisdiction over the use of the church.
The proposed subcommittee would
formulate criteria for the use of the
church for "secular activities" and
would interpret that criteria in case of
disputes.
Charges Repression
Napier speculated that the proposed
action may be "an effort to curb what
we're doing over here ... to save the
University from embarrassment," in
response to influential conservative
forces.
Tom Bacchetti, of the Office of
Public Events, denied that the
university is involved in censorship.
However, he affirmed that there are
university regulations regarding the use
of calhpus facilities.
Among these are regulations that the
activity must be sponsored by an
organization registered with Stanford
and that any financial transactions

involved must be made through student
banking facilities.
'Multi-Face ted Idea'
Bachetti described the
recommendation as "multi-faceted,"
and emphasized that COPE does not
make policy, but recommends the use
of university facilities for public events.
"The question of responsibility has
arisen, Bachetti explained "and it seems
necessary to consider the question of
criteria (in the allocation of church
space) for secular activities... as
opposed to any other campus building.
Napier feels that an "impossible
effort is being made to separate the
religious from the secular, "Any
program which seriously probes into
the understanding of mankind is ... of
a religious nature. If (the
administration) cannot understand
that, they had better close the Chapel."
He is "astonished" that such a
recommendation has been made.
"They should not ask me to submit
(to the authority of this subcommittee)
without regard to their competence.
"I have two advisory bodies:" he
continued, "the Chapel Board (a group
of students and faculty headed by one
of the assistants to the Dean) and the
Memorial Church Advisory Committee
(an official university committee
formed this year) as well as staff
assistants."

Napier feels thatthese boards are
more knowlegable of the church's
administrative structure than the
proposed committee. "I have never
operated singlehandedly or without
advice from authorities such as these
boards," he remarked.
Bachetti maintains that the
university is "definitely" short on
space, and needs Mem Chu.
"With 11,000 students and growing
numbers of faculty and staff groups,
requests for use of the Chapel have
multiplied drastically." Napier scoffed
at the justification of limited space as
"not germane at all. They're already
welcome to use the space available."
The non-denominational church has

functioned in diverse capacities in
recent times. The Chapel served as the
insane asylum setting for the play
Marat-Sade, as a forum for David
Harris, as a rehearsal and concert hall,
and even as a recording studio for the
Stanford Band.
A letter in defense of the present
Chapel authority has been written by
Professor Jerry Irish, of the Memorial
Church Advisory Committee.
President Lyman has received a
resolution from the National
Association of College University
Chaplains, protesting the proposal. He
has appointed an arbiter from the
faculty, and the dispute should be
settled in the near future.
