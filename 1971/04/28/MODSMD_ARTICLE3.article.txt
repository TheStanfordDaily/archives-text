# Violation Of Senate Resolution?
## ROTC Recruiting Charged 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
A confrontation between members
of Columbae House and Stanford's
60-man Naval ROTC contingent early
yesterday morning turned into an
amicable discussion of politics and
war as the ROTC midshipmen broke
their drill ranks on Maloney Field to
join the 25-member Columbae group in
a breakfast of coffee cake and granola.
Columbae House spokesman Dave
Josephson stated that the non-violent
house arrainged the confrontation in
order to find out more about and to

publicize a "new two year ROTC
program."
In a statement which Josephson read
to the group, he noted "We are shocked
at any action toward increasing the
ROTC program on campus and strongly
protest the blatant attempt on the part
of the ROTC program to go against the
student-faculty resolutions on ROTC.
"As always we understand the final
responsibility for actions in this
university community rest before the
Provost and President Lyman and his
staff. We understand that the discovery

and public exposure of the new ROTC
program had to come from outside
those individuals who have the power
of policy in their hands."
Fire-line Interpretation
The question of whether or not such
recruitment of new cadets into the
program is in violation of the Senate
resolution depends on fine-line
interpretation of resolution's wording.
The Faculty Senate recommended
last June that the president take
appropriate steps to, "ensure that no
one be allowed to enroll in any ROTC
program as currently constituted after
August 31, 1970.
The recruitment leaflet sent out by
the Army ROTC calls the two year
program "new." And hence the
question arises as to whether or not a
"new" program can be construed to be
under the classification of "currnetly
constituted."
There is even some question as to
whether or not the two year program is
a new one. One cadet when asked
stated that "the Army ROTC has
always had a two year program."
Unavailable For Comment
Col. Stanley M. Ramey U.S.A. who
heads the Army ROTC here was
unavailable for comment on this new
recruitment program. But Navy Capt.
John C. Duck, Chairman of the Naval
Science Department, told the Columbae
group that the Navy has no such
program and fully intends to phase out
its program by the 1973 deadline.
Josephson then read a letter to the
gathering which he stated was written
by President Lyman to Prof. T. J.
Connolly, Chairman of the Advisory

Committee on ROTC Affiars. The
letter read in part:
"I have beer, informed of a military
Science program involving two years of
training that may be in conflict with
the Academic Council resolution on the
Status of ROTC.
"I am asking Col. Ramey to take no
further steps to implement this
program until your committee has an
opportunity to evaluate it against the
academic Council status."
Mass Memos
Capt. Duck stated that Col. Ramey
sent out mass memos on new program,
so Columbae House could hardly call
the recruitment "secret." He added
however that Connolly's committee
was the proper authority to consider
whether or not the program was in
violation of the Council ruling. "The
Navy," he said, "has accepted no new
people since that ruling (last June)."
The Columbae House students
arrived on the field around 7:15 a.m.
and immediately began passing food
around to all the mid-shipmen. Navy
Capt. Duck then stepped forward and
read a prepared statement to the group
which read in part, "... since your
goal as future officers, with the
Vietnam War winding down, will be the
preservation of peace and the
maintenance of a deterrent force
against would-be aggressors and the
goal of Colimbae House is peace, the
views may not be too divergent."
The groups then withdrew to a
nearby grandstand and began to break
down into discussion groups. Questions
came from both sides and ran the
gamut from the need to defend
America from communism to the
desirability of non-violent action.
Lt. J.G. David Maupin said that he
saw a definite "need for dialogue
between groups of differing opinions.
Today's meeting, he said, "may not
have changed many views on either
side, yet it did make each side realize
that each is a human being."
He also stated that he would like to
see more community participation in
the NROTC weekly discussion groups

that meet in the oak grove next to the
athletic building every Tuesday at
noon.
Philosophy of Non-violence
A Columbae spokesman explained
to the mid-shipmen and the assembled
officers how Columbae came to be
formed and its basic philosophy of
non-violence.
The meeting lasted for about an
hour and a half after which some of the
officers expressed their surprise and
pleasure that things went so well.
