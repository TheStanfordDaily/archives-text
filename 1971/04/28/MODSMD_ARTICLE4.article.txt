# Eleven Nabbed In Foothill Protest
## 
### HALL DAILY 
Eleven Foothill Junior College students were
arrested last night for unlawful assembly and
trespassing at the Cusack House on the Foothill
campus. Some 150 to 200 students had occupied the
building off and on since early yesterday morning.
The Cusack House, condemned in 1957 as unsafe
for occupancy under the 1933 earthquake safety
Field Act, was occupied by the students as the site
for a student-controlled student-community center.
One of the spokesman for the student group,
Rocky Tripodi, said, "There are those here who are
committed to a moral point (student control),
committed to the feeling to stop being a nigger. We've
got to assert ourselves as individuals."
Tripodi, outspoken at Foothill as a Vietnam War
critic, was arrested along with nine other men,
including Foothill JC student body Vice President
Dan Ybbara, and one woman, Cindy Karp.
The Santa Clara Tactical squad arrived at the
house at 8:21 p.m., twenty strong. At 8:23, Sergeant
Donald Tamm of the Santa Clara County Sheriffs'
Department declared the occupation an illegal
assembly and charged the students with trespassing.
By 8:25, the tac squad had secured the building with
the help of six rent-a-cops who escorted part of the
unit through the back door.
"You can go easy ... or hard," Tamm said.
Immediately, several pf the student occupants
replied, "Easy. Easy, man."
Calling The Police
Dr. Calvin Flint, Foothill District Community
College Superintendent, made the decision to call in
the police for the second time after the students

re-entered the house at 6:30 p.m. following the
departure of the initial tac squad arrival on campus
at 5:25.
During that one-hour confrontation, the students
had left the building and reassembled on the porch
while the police secured the house by boarding up
two third floor doors and locking the front and back
doors on the ground floor.
The students then re-entered the house through a
window, carefully left unlocked, and opened the
house.
Before the police arrived, Dr. Flint had presented
the occupants with a 5:00 deadline to leave the
premises. The "Final Notice," officially authorized
by the Board of Trustees, offered not to press charges
against those who complied with the deadline and
warned that violators of the final notice would be
cleared out "by whatever means necessary." Violators
also would face legal charges.
Commenting on the decision to call in the police,
Dr. Flint said, "The students made the decision for
us. They broke the agreement. They had agreed to
stay out till Wednesday and meet with me at 8:00
a.m. Wednesday."
The meeting should take place this morning if the
students decide to negotiate the issue with the
President and Superintendent.
Dr. Flint said he felt "terribly sorry that the
students chose this way. We want to work with them.
They seem determined, but they fail to see the other
5,000 students who also want to use the student
center."
Tripoli complained that Foothill has no student
center under student control. "The Student Center is

completely under the administration's control and
rules. And anyone who's politically-inclined or with
long hair finds the normal channels clogged."
First Deadline
The first confrontation of the day occured at
11:20 a.m. when Dr. Kenneth Griffin Dean set the
first deadline to clear the building.
After a fruitless informal discussion at 10:45, Dr.
Driffin, joined by Dean of Students Dr. Harry
Bradley and Dean of Student Activities Richard
Henning, sat down in chairs in front of the house at
11:45 and discussed the student center issue with the
demonstrators.
By this time, the students had officially declared
the house "liberated territory" and begun the
occupation.
During this discussion, an encounter erupted
between Tripodi and Griffin. Tripodi said he was
tired of the administration's "bureaucratic bullshit."
Griffin replied by saying that students "have proper
channels."
At last report, the 40 to 50 students involved were
meeting in the Campus Council chambers mapping
future strategy.
Cindy Karp said that the house would be used as a
student-community center. Different activities had
already been planned for the liberated structure
including a child day care center, women's group
center, coffee house, leaflet distribution center for
anti war activists, and an open meeting room for the
community. The "democratic building" could also
facilitate a headquarters for the Mountain View Food
Coop in the future.
