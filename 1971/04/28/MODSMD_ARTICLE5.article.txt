u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby

payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.

processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in

1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who

Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan

an information office there and

for organized basketball

Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade

government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National

And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting

Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and

[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the

[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the

; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would

credibility of thriller fiction.

members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister

that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International

Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced

vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile

northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the

nearby rendezvous with the local

can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of

are three major networks. Some

outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United

dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a

but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican

II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the

the traffic that were it to appear

The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of

heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

u Mr. President, the specter of
[heroin addiction is haunting
•nearly every community in the
[nation." With these urgent words,
Vance Hartke spoke up
on March 2 in support of a
Resolution on drug control being
in the U.S. Senate.
[Estimating that there are 500,000
,'heroin addicts in the U.S., he
•pointed out that nearly 20
[percent of them are teenagers.
[ The concern of Hartke and
•others is not misplaced. Heroin
[has become the major killer of
[young people between 18 and 35,
•outpacing death from accidents,
[suicides or cancer. It has also
[become a major cause of crime: to
•sustain their habits, addicts in the
[U.S. spend more than $15 million
;a day, half of it coming from the
155 percent of crime in the cities
[which they commit and the
•annual $2.5 billion worth of
[ goods they steal.
[ Once safely isolated as part of
•the destructive funkiness of the
[black ghetto, heroin has suddenly
; spread out into Middle America,
• becoming as much a part of
[suburbia as the Saturday
• barbecue. This has gained it the
[ attention it otherwise never would
[ have had. President Nixon himself
• says it is spreading with
[ "pandemic virulence."
; People are becoming aware
«that teenagers are shooting up at
[ lunchtime in schools and
• returning to classrooms to nod the
-day away. But what they don't
know—and what no one is telling
them- is that neither the volcanic
eruption of addiction in this
country nor the crimes it causes
would be possible without the
age-old international trade in
opium (from which heroin is
derived), or that heroin
a d diction—like inflation,
unemployment, and most of the
other chaotic forces in America
society today—is directly related
to the U.S. war in Indochina.
The connection between war
and opium in Asia is as old as
empire itself. But the relationship
has never been so symbiotic, so
intricate in its networks and so
vast in its implications. Never
before has the trail of tragedy
been so clearly marked as in the
present phase of U.S. involvement
in Southeast Asia.
For the international traffic in
opium has expanded in lockstep
with the expanding U.S. military
pressence there, just as heroin has
stalked the same young people in
U.S. high schools who will also be
called on to fight that war. The
ironies that have accompanied the
war in Vietnam since its onset are
more poignant than before.
At the very moment that
public officials are wringing their
hands over the heroin problem,
Washington's own Cold War
crusade, replete with clandestine
activities that would seem
far-fetched even in a spy novel,
continues to play a major role in a
process that has already rerouted
the opium traffic from the Middle
East to Southeast Asia and is
every day opening new channels
for its shipment to the U.S.
At the same time the
government starts crash programs
to rehabilitate drug users among
its young people, the young
soldiers it is sending to Vietnam
are getting hooked and dying of
overdoses at the rate of one a day.
While the President is declaring
war on narcotics and on crime in
the streets, he is widening the war
in Laos, whose principal product
is opium and which has now
become the funnel for nearly half
the world's supply of the narcotic,
for which the U.S. is the chief
consumer.
There would have been a
bloodthirsty logic behind the
expansion of the war into Laos if
the thrust had been to seize
supply centers of opium the
communists were hoarding up to
spread like a deadly virus into the
free world. But the communists
did not control the opium there:
the processing and distribution
was already in the hands of the
free world.
Who are the principals of this
new opium war? The übiquitous
CIA, whose role in getting the
U.S. into Vietnam is well known
but whose pivotal position in the
opium trade is not; and a rogue's
gallery of organizations and
people-from an opium army
subsidized by the Nationalist
Chinese to such familiar names as
Madame Nhu and Vice President
Nguyen Cao Ky- who are the
creations of U.S. policy in that
part of the world.
The story of opium in
Southeast Asia is a strange one at
every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.

every turn. But the conclusion is
known in advance: this war has
come home again—in a silky grey
powder that goes from a syringe
into America's mainline.
Most of the opium in
Southeast Asia is grown in a
region known as the "Fertile
Triangle," an area covering
northwestern Burma, northern
Thailand, and Laos. It is a
mountainous jungle inhabited by
tigers, elephants, and some of the
most poisonous snakes in the
world.
The source of the opium that
shares the area with these exotic
animals is the poppy, and the

main growers are the Meo hill
tribespeople who inhabit the
region. The Meo men chop back
the forests in the wet season so
that the crop can be planted in
August and September. Poppies
produce red, white or purple
blossoms between January and
March, and when the blossom
withers, an egg-sized pod is left.
The women harvest the crop
and make a small incision in the
pod with a three-bladed knife.
The pod exudes a white latex-like
substance which is left to
accumulate and thicken for a day
or two. Then it is carefully
gathered, boiled to remove gross
impurities, and the sticky
substance is rolled into balls
weighing several pounds.
A fraction of the opium
remains to be smoked by the
villagers, but most is sold in
nearby rendezvous with the local
smugglers. It is the Meos' only
cash crop. The hill tribe growers
can collect as much as $50 per
kilo, paid in gold, silver, various
commodities, or local currency.
The same kilo will bring $200 in
Saigon and $2000 in San
Francisco.
There are hundreds of routes,
and certainly as many methods of
transport by which the smugglers
ship opium—some of it already
refined into heroin- through and
out of Southeast Asia. But there
are three major networks. Some
of the opium from Burma and
northern Thailand moves into
Bangkok, then to Singapore and
Hong Kong, then via military
aircraft, either directly or through
Taiwan, to the United States.
The second, and probably
major, route is from Burma or
Laos to Saigon or to ocean drops
in the Gulf of Siam; then it goes
either through the Middle East
and Marseille to the U.S. or
through Hong Kong and
Singapore to the West Coast. A
final route runs directly from
outposts held by Nationalist
Chinese troops in Thailand to
Taiwan and then to the U.S. by a
variety of means.
One of the most successful of
the opium entrepreneurs who
travel these routes, a Time
reporter wrote in 1967, is Chan
Chi-foo, a half-Chinese, half-Shan
(Burmese) modern-day warlord
who might have stepped out of a
Joseph Conrad adventure yarn.
Chan is a soft-spoken,
mild-mannered man in his late
thirties who, it is said, is totally
ruthless. He has tremendous
knowledge of the geography and
people of northwestern Burma
and is said to move easily among
them, conversing in several
dialects.
Yet he is also able to deal
comfortably with the bankers and
other businessmen who finance
his operations from such centers
as Bangkok and Vientiane. Under
Chan Chi-foo's command are from
1000-2000 well-armed men, with
the feudal hierarchy spreading
down to encompass another 3000
hill tribesmen, porters, hunters
and opium growers who pay him
fealty and whom he regards about
the same as the more than 500
small mules he uses for transport.
Moving the opium from Berma
to Thailand or Laos is a big and
dangerous operation. One of
Chan's caravans, says one
are-struck observer, may stretch in
single file for well over a mile, and
may include 200 mules. 200
porters, 200 cooks and camp
attendants, and about 400 armed
guards. Such a caravan can easily
carry 15 to 20 tons of opium,
worth nearly a million dollars
when delivered to syndicate men
in Laos or Thailand.
To get his caravans to market,
however, Chan must pay a price,
for the crucial part of his route is
heavily patrolled not by Thais or
Laotians but by nomadic
Nationalist Chinese or
Kuomingtang (KMT) troops.
Still supported by the ruling
KMT on Taiwan, Generalissimo
Chiang Kai-shek's 93rd Division
controls a major part of the
opium flowing out of Burma and
Thailand. Roving bands of
mercenary bandits, they fled to
northern Burma in 1949 as
Chiang's armies were being routed
on the Chinese mainland, and
have maintained themselves since
by buying opium from the nearby
Meo tribesmen which they then
resell, or by exacting tribute
payments from entrepreneurs like
Chan Chi-foo.
As travellers to the area attest,
these troops also supplement their

income by running intelligence
operations into China and Burma
for the U.S.
The Burmese government
regularly complained about all
this activity to the United
Nations, the Taiwan government
and the United States, charging
the Americans and Taiwanese
with actively supplying and
supporting the KMT, which in
turn has organized
anti-government guerrillas.
In 1959 Burmese ground
troops seized three opium
processing plants set up by the
KMT guerrillas at Wanton; the
troops also took an airstrip the
Chinese had used to fly in
reinforcements. By February
1961 the Burmese had pushed the
KMT troops southeast into the
Thai-Burmese and Thai-Laotian
border areas, where they now
hold at least eight village bases.
Just last year a reporter who
was at Cheing Mai, Thailand, saw
Thai troops and American
advisors as well as military
supplies provided by the Taiwan
government. The Taiwan
government, he noted, maintains
an information office there and
regularly accompanies the KMT
troops on their forays into China
to proselytize among the peasants
of Yunnan province.
These sorties are coordinated
by the CIA (which is feverishly
active if not wholly successful in
this area), and the United States
even provides its own backwater
R&R for the weary KMT, flying
its helicopters from hilltop tc
hilltop to pick up the Chinese
(and the Establishment reporter
who supplied this information)
for organized basketball
tournaments.
Although the KMT troops are
often referred to as "remnants,"
they are not just debris left
behind by history. They are in
fact an important link in
American and Taiwan policy
toward Communist China. Not
only does Chiang Kai-shek
maintain direct contact with his
old 93rd, but fresh recruits are
frequently sent to maintain a
troop level of from 5000 to 7000
men, according to a top-ranking
foreign aid official in the U.S.
government.
And, as the New York Times
has noted, Chiang Kai-shek's son,
Chiang Ching-Kuo is widely
believed to be in charge of the
KMT operations from his position
as chief of the Taiwan secret
police.
The KTM are tolerated by the
Thais for several reasons: they
have helped in the
counterinsurgency efforts of the
Thai and U.S. governments against
the hill tribespeople in Thailand;
they have aided the training and
recruiting of Burmese guerrilla
armies for the CIA; and they offer
a payoff to the Border Patrol
Police (BPP), and through them to
the second most powerful man in
Thailand, Minister of the Interior
Gen. Prapasx Charusathira.
The BBP were trained in the
'50's by the CIA and now are
financed and advised by AID and
are flown from border village to
border village by Air America.
The BBP act as middlemen in the
opium trade between the KMT in
the remote regions of Thailand
and the Chinese merchants of
Bangkok.
These relationships, of course,
are flexible and changing, with
each group wanting to maximize
profits and minimize antagonisms
and dangers. But the established
routes vary, and sometimes
double-crosses are intentional.
In the summer of 1967 Chan
Chi-foo set out from Burma
through the KMT's territory with
300 men and 200 packhorses
carrying nine tons of opium, with
no intention of paying the usual
fee of $80,000 protection money.
But troops cut off the group
near the Laotian village of Ban
Houei Sai in an ambush that
turned into a pitched battle.
Neither group, however, had
counted on the involvement of
the cotterpin of the area's opium
trade: the CIA-backed Royal Lao
Government Army and Air Force,

under the command of General
Ouane Rathikoune.
Hearing of the skirmish, the
general pulled his armed forces
out of the Plain of Jars in
northeastern Laos where they
were supposed to be fighting the
Pathet Lao guerrillas, and enpnged
two companies and his entire air
force in a battle of extermination
against both sides. The result was
nearly 30 KMT and Burmese dead
and a half-ton windfall of opium
for the Royal Laotian
Government.
In a moment of revealing
frankness shortly after the battle,
General Rathikoune, far from
denying the role that opium had
played, told several reporters that
the opium trade was "not bad for
Laos." The trade provides cash
income for the Meo hill tribes, he
argued, who would otherwise be
penniless and therefore a threat to
Laos's political stability.
He also argued that the trade
gives the Lao elite (which includes
government officials) a chance to
accumulate capital to ultimately
invest in legitimate enterprises,
thus building up Laos's economy.
But if these rationalizations

seemed weak, far less convincing
was the general's assertion that,
since he is in total control of the
trade now, when the time comes
to put an end to it lie will simply
put an end to it.
It is unlikely that Rathikoune,
one of the chief warlords of the
opium dynasty, will decide to end
the trade soon. Right outside the
village of Ban Houei Sai, hidden in
the jungle, are several of his
re fineries — called
"cookers"—which manufacture
crude morphine (which is refined
into heroin at a later transport
point) under the supervision of
professional pharmacists imported
from Bangkok.
Rathikoune also has "cookers"
in the nearby villages of Ban
Khwan, Phan Phung and Ban
Kheung (the latter for opium
grown by the Yao tribe). Most of
the opium he procures comes
from Burma in caravans such as
Chan Chi-foo's; the rest comes
from Thailand or from the hill
tribespeople (Meo and Yao) in the
area near Ban Houei Sai.
Rathikoune flies the dope from
the Ban Houei Sai area to Luang
Prabang, the Royalist capital, in
helicopters given by the U.S.
military aid program.
Others in the Lao elite and
government own refineries. There
are cookers for heroin in
Vientiane, two blocks from the
King's residence; near Luang
Prabang; on Khong Island in the
Mekong River on the
Lao-Cambodian border; and one
recently built by Kouprasith
Abhay (head of the military
region around Vientiane, but also
from the powerful Abhay family
of Khong Island) at Phou Khao
Khouai, just north of Vientaine.
Other Lords of the Trade are

Prince Boun Oum of Southern
Laos, and the Sananikone family,
called the "Rockefellers of Laos."
Phoui Sananikone, the clan
patriarch, headed a U.S.backed
coup in 1959 and is presently
President of the National
Assembly. Two other Sananikones
are deputies in the Assembly, two
are generals (one is Chief of Staff
for Rathikoune), one is Minister
of Public Works, and a host of
others are to be found at lower
levels of the political, military and
civil service structure.
And the Sananikones' airline,
Veha Akhat, leases planes and
pilots from Taiwan for
paramilitary operations which
lend themselves easily to
commerce with opium-growing
tribespeople. But the opium trade
is popular with the rest of the
elite, who rent RLG aircraft or
create fly-by-night airlines (such
as Laos Air Charter or Lao United
Airlines) to do their own direct
dealing.
Control of the opium trade has
not always been in the hands of
the Lao elite, although the U.S.
has been at least peripherally
involved in who the beneficiaries

were since John Foster Dulles's
famous 1954 commitment to
maintain an anti-communist Laos.
The major source of the opium
in Laos has always been the Meo
growers, who were selected by the
CIA as its counterinsurgency
bulwark against the Pathet Lao
guerrillas. The Meos' mountain
bastion is Long Cheng, a secret
base 80 miles northeast of
Vientiane, built by the CIA during
the 1962 Geneva Accords period.
By 1964 Long Cheng's
population was nearly 50,000
comprised largely of refugees who
had come to escape the war and
who were kept busy growing
poppies in the hills surrounding
the base.
The secrecy surrounding Long
Cheng has hidden the trade from
reporters. But security has not
been complete: Carl Strock
reported in the January 30 Far
Eastern Economic Review, "Over
the years eight journalists,
including myself, have slipped
into Long Cheng and have seen
American crews loading T-28
bombers while armed CIA agents
chatted with uniformed Thai
soldiers and piles of raw opium
stood for sale in the market (a
kilo for $52). It's old hat by now,
but Long Cheng is still so secret
that in the past year both the U.S.
embassy press attache and the
director of USAID's training
center were denied clearance to
visit the mountain redoubt."
The CIA not only protects the
opium in Long Cheng and various
other pick-up points, but also
gives clearance and protection to
opium-laden aircraft flying out.
For some time, the primary
middle-men in the opium traffic
had been elements of the Corsican
Mafia, identified in a 1966 United

Nations report as a pivotal
organization in the flow of
narcotics.
In a part of the world where
transportation is a major problem
and where air transport is a
solution, the Corsicans were able
to parlay their vintage World War
II airplanes (called "the butterfly
fleet" or, according to "Pop"
Buell, U.S. citizen-at-large in the
area, "Air Opium") into a
position of control.
But as the Laotian civil war
intensified in the period following
1963, it became increasingly
difficult for the Corsicans to
operate, and the Meo started to
have trouble getting their crop out
of the hills in safety.
The vacuum that was created
was quickly filled by the Royal
Lao Air Force, which began to use
helicopters and planes donated by
the U.S. not only for fighting the
Pathet Lao but also for flying
opium out from airstrips
pockmarking the Laotian hills.
This arrangement was
politically more advantageous
than prior ones, for it
consolidated the interests of all
the anti-communist parties. The
enfranchisement of the Lao elite
gave it more of an incentive to
carry on the war Dulles had
committed the U.S. to back; the
safe transport of the Meo's opium
by an ideologically sanctioned
network increased the incentive of
these CIA-equipped and trained
tribesmen to fight the Pathet Lao.
The U.S. got parties that would

cooperate with its foreign policj
not only for political reasons, bu:
on more solid economic grounds.
Opium was the economic cement
binding all the parties together
much more closely than
anti-communism could.
As this relationship has
matured, Long Cheng has become
a major collection point for
opium grown in Laos. CIA
protege General Vang Pao, former
officer for the French colonial
army and now head of the Meo
counter-insurgents, uses his U.S.
supplied helicopters and STOL
(short-take-off-and-landing)
aircraft to collect the opium from
the surrounding area.
It is unloaded and stored in
hutches in Long Cheng. Some of
it is sold there and flown out in
Royal Laotion Government C-47's
to Saigon or the Gulf of Siam or
the South China Sea, where it is
dropped to waiting fishing boats.
Some of the opium is flown to
Vientiane, where it is sold to
Chinese merchants who then fly it
to Saigon or to the ocean drops.
One of Vang Pao's main sources
of transport since the RLG Air
Force is not under his control, is
the CIA-created Xieng Khouang
Airline, which is still supervised
by an American, though it is
scheduled soon to be turned over
completely to Vang Pao's men.
The airline's two C-47's (which
can carry a maximum of 4000
pounds) are used only for
transport to Vientiane.
Prior to Nixon's blitzkreig in
Laos, the opium trade was

booming. Production had grown
rapidly since the early '50's to a
level of 175-200 tons a year, with
400 of the 600 tons produced in
Burma, and much of the 50-100
tons grown in Thailand, passing
through Laotian territory.
But if the opium has been an
El Dorado for the Corsicans, the
Lao elite, the CIA and others, it
has been a nemesis for the Meo
tribesmen. For in becoming a
pawn in the larger strategy of the
U.S., the Meos have seen the army
virtually wiped out, with the
average age of recruits now 15
years, and their population
reduced from 400,000 to
200,000.
The Meos' reward for CIA
service, in other words, has been
their destruction as a people.
Both the complexity and the
finality of the opium web which
connects Burma, Thailand, Laos
and South Vietnam stretch the
imagination. So bizarre is the
opium network and so pervasive
the traffic that were it to appear
in an lan Fleming plot we would
pass it off as torturing the
credibility of thriller fiction.
But the trade is real and the
net has entangled governments
beyond the steaming jungle of
Indochina. In 1962, for instance,
an opium-smuggling scandal
stunned the entire Canadian
members of the immaculate UN
International Prime Minister
Diefenbaker confirmed rumors
that nine Canadian members of
the immaculate UN International
Control Commission had been
caught carrying opium from
Vientiane to the international
markets in Saigon on Un planes.
The route from Laos to Saigon
has long been one of the
well-established trails of the
heroin-opium trade. In August
1956, a C-47 transport plane
carrying two-and-a-half tons of
opium and some gold was forced
down near Da Lat. South
Vietnam, by American gunners
when the pilot failed to identify
himself.
The plane and its precious
cargo, reportedly owned by
General Rathikoune's wife, were
destined for a Chinese opium
merchant and piloted by a former
KMT pilot. L.G. Chao. Whatever
their ownership, the dope-running
planes usually land at Tan Son
Nhut airbase, where they are met
in a remote part of the airport
with the protection of the airport
police.
A considerable part of the
opium and heroin remain in
Saigon, where it is sold directly to
U.S. troops or distributed to U.S.
bases throughout the Vietnamese
countryside. One G.I. who
returned to the states an addict
was August Schultz. He's off the
needle now, but how he got on is
most revealing.
Explaining that he was
"completely straight, even a
right-winger" before he went into
the Army, August told
RAMPARTS how he fell into the
heroin trap: "It was a regular day
last April [1970] and 1 just
walked into this bunker and there
were these two guys shooting up I
said to them, 'What you guys
doing?' Believe it or not I really
didn't know. They explained it to
me and asked me if I wanted to
try it. I said sure."
Probably a fifth of the men in
his unit have at least tried junk,
August says. But the big thing, as
his buddy Ronnie McSheffrey
adds, was that most of the officers
in his company—including the
MP's—knew about it.
McSheffrey saw MP's in his
own division (6th Battalion, 31st
Infantry, 9th Division) at Tan An
shoot up, just as he says they saw
him. He and his buddies even
watched the unit's sergeant-major
receive payoffs at a nearby
whorehouse where every kind of
drug imaginable was available.
