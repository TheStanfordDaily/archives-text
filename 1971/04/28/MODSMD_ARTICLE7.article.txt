In a news analysis of the
Pakistani Civil War, published on
April 22, The DAILY stated that,
"East Pakistan's 78 million short,
dark-skinned inhabitants refer to
themselves as Bengalis, while West
Pakistan's 58 million people, taller
and lighter-skinned, call
themselves Punjabis."
We have since been informed
by several tall and/or light skinned
Bengalis that our generalization
was incorrect. If our source of
information (Crims Magazine) was
indeed mistaken, the DAILY
apologizes. We also regret any
racist implications which our
readers may have inferred from
the statement.
