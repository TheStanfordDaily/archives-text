# 'Creature Features' Features Creatures
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Bob "Mr. Excitement" Wilkins is the host of KTVU's Creature
Features which has been recently sweeping the campus like a giant
broom.
Terrorizing T.V. screens from Mayfield to Manzanita every
Saturday night at 9:30 p.m., the show features unbelievably bad
horror films, e.g. Dracula Meets BiUy the Kid Women From A
Prehistoric Planet, Horror Beach Party. Well, you get the picture.
It seems pretty incredible that bad horror flicks on Saturday night
could attract a large viewing audience, but Bob explains, "Things are
pretty slow at Stanford."
One reason for the show's appeal, since it can't be the movies,
appears to be Bob himself. Sitting in his rocking chair, puffing on a
cigar beside his "Free King Kong" poster, Bob gives penetrating
insights into the movies he shows: "If you've just tuned in you
haven't missed much," or "Last week's film was really terrible."
Certainly one thing that never ceases to amaze Creature Feature
viewers is the quality of films Bob actually dares to put on the air.
Comments from people watching the flicks range from "What else is
on?" to snoring.
Bob explains how he selects the films; "1 don't."
As it turns out, the T.V. station buys films in batches, and when it
buys a batch of first rate titles, movie companies often throw in some
horror films free. And that's what you're watching on Creature
Features, or to judge from the show's most recent ratings, not
watching.
Sometimes the movies even get too bad for Bob to handle, so that
last week he cancelled the scheduled flicks, The Sea Serpent from
Sausalito, and Melvin Belli Meets the Mushroom People.
One part of the show that is somewhat unusual, in that people like
it, is the "Instant Replay." At the end of the show, the most unusual
or more often the worst part of that week's Creature Feature is shown
again.
The idea got started, says Bob, the week he showed Horror Beach
Party. There was one scene where two monsters killed seven girls in
two minutes. "I just felt that one was worth seeing again," says Bob.
One thing that puzzles many Creature Feature viewers is how Bob
got started on the road to be the great T.V. celebrity he is today.
While he was working for Channel 3 in Sacramento one day, a friend
said, "Gee Bob, you ought to have your own show." Isn't that
exciting?
Even though Bob has his own show now, he still works for an
advertising firm in Sacramento. "I couldn't live on what they pay me
to do the show," he explains.
Being an advertising man perhaps explains Bob's attitude to the
show and its audience. "The worse the movies are, the longer people
will watch them," he says.
Although this seems like a pretty good philosophy in theory, the
show's most recent ratings would tend to discredit it.
Creature Features did manage to edge out three stations, however:
the educational station, an FM station in Pinole, and the student
station at San Jose State.
Commenting on the ratings Bob says, "We're on thin ice."
So if you're one of the few people that apparently really want to
see this show, you'd better hurry up.


THE ABOMINABLE SHOWMAN STRIKES AGAIN—Yes, folks, that famous T.V. celebrity, Bob
Wilkins, manages to get yet another group of Stanford students to turn on his show and then fall asleep.
How does Bob do it? Showing flicks like Horror Beach Party and Draeula Meets Billy the Kid could have
something to do with it.

insights into the movies he shows: "If you've just tuned in you
haven't missed much," or "Last week's film was really terrible."
Certainly one thing that never ceases to amaze Creature Feature
viewers is the quality of films Bob actually dares to put on the air.
Comments from people watching the flicks range from "What else is
on?" to snoring.
Bob explains how he selects the films; "1 don't."
As it turns out, the T.V. station buys films in batches, and when it
buys a batch of first rate titles, movie companies often throw in some
horror films free. And that's what you're watching on Creature
Features, or to judge from the show's most recent ratings, not
watching.
Sometimes the movies even get too bad for Bob to handle, so that
last week he cancelled the scheduled flicks, The Sea Serpent from
Sausalito, and Melvin Belli Meets the Mushroom People.
One part of the show that is somewhat unusual, in that people like
it, is the "Instant Replay." At the end of the show, the most unusual
or more often the worst part of that week's Creature Feature is shown
again.
The idea got started, says Bob, the week he showed Horror Beach
Party. There was one scene where two monsters killed seven girls in
two minutes. "I just felt that one was worth seeing again," says Bob.
One thing that puzzles many Creature Feature viewers is how Bob
got started on the road to be the great T.V. celebrity he is today.
While he was working for Channel 3 in Sacramento one day, a friend
said, "Gee Bob, you ought to have your own show." Isn't that
exciting?
Even though Bob has his own show now, he still works for an
advertising firm in Sacramento. "I couldn't live on what they pay me
to do the show," he explains.
Being an advertising man perhaps explains Bob's attitude to the
show and its audience. "The worse the movies are, the longer people
will watch them," he says.
Although this seems like a pretty good philosophy in theory, the
show's most recent ratings would tend to discredit it.
Creature Features did manage to edge out three stations, however:
the educational station, an FM station in Pinole, and the student
station at San Jose State.
Commenting on the ratings Bob says, "We're on thin ice."
So if you're one of the few people that apparently really want to
see this show, you'd better hurry up.


THE ABOMINABLE SHOWMAN STRIKES AGAIN—Yes, folks, that famous T.V. celebrity, Bob
Wilkins, manages to get yet another group of Stanford students to turn on his show and then fall asleep.
How does Bob do it? Showing flicks like Horror Beach Party and Draeula Meets Billy the Kid could have
something to do with it.
Bob "Mr. Excitement" Wilkins is the host of KTVU's Creature
Features which has been recently sweeping the campus like a giant
broom.
Terrorizing T.V. screens from Mayfield to Manzanita every
Saturday night at 9:30 p.m., the show features unbelievably bad
horror films, e.g. Dracula Meets BiUy the Kid Women From A
Prehistoric Planet, Horror Beach Party. Well, you get the picture.
It seems pretty incredible that bad horror flicks on Saturday night
could attract a large viewing audience, but Bob explains, "Things are
pretty slow at Stanford."
One reason for the show's appeal, since it can't be the movies,
appears to be Bob himself. Sitting in his rocking chair, puffing on a
cigar beside his "Free King Kong" poster, Bob gives penetrating
insights into the movies he shows: "If you've just tuned in you
haven't missed much," or "Last week's film was really terrible."
