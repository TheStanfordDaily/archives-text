# Spray Use Protest
## 
### 
A protest against the use of lead arsenate in spraying for oak
moth has been lodged with the State Department of Agriculture by
a graduate student in genetics.
Dale Hattis of Inglewood wrote Agriculture Director Jerry W.
Fielder that the use of a ton or more of the pesticide used in the
East Palo Alto area where he lives is a "needless an unacceptable
hazard to public health. I hope you will use the powers of your
office to halt this practice immediately."
The reason, Hattis said, is that the use of arsenates of
lead as insecticides over the long term is a possible source of lung
cancer in humans.
The banning of DDT as a pesticide was commendable, Hattis
noted, but pointed out that there are at least two other sprays
which can be used against oak moth which are less dangerous and
just as effective as lead arsenate.
He presented evidence with his letter to show that smelter
workers in the U.S. and vintners in Germany had suffered from
lung and respiratory cancer after exposure to lead arsenate sprays,
including "Paris green." These types of sprays have been banned in
Germany since 1942, Hattis pointed out.
He noted that he had worked for the Ralph Nader organization
during the summer of 1970 and was sending a copy of the
complaint letter to them.
