# Late May Hearing?
## Franklin Date Not Set 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Suspended English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin's hearing before the
Faculty Advisory Board will probably
be in late May. However no official
date has been set for the case of the
Maoist Melville scholar whom President
Lyman suspended on February 15 and
who faces possible dismissal.
James Siena, legal advisor to the
President, and Advisory Board
Chairman David M. Mason have both
indicated they hope to have
preliminary meetings between all
parties in the case in early May, with
the actual hearings beginning later that
month.
President Lyman formally filed
charges against Franklin over a month
ago, and Franklin has recently charged
that his case a dormant issue on campus
in recent weeks is being purposefully
"stalled" by the administration. "I
think they're trying to put things off
until dead week or finals week," he
explained.
Siena denied the charge however,
claiming that "there has been no
attempt on the part of the
administration to delay the case." Siena
added that Franklin's attorney was
currently tied up with several other
cases, and that had been the principle
reason for the delay.
Franklin says however, "The main
delay right now is that 1 can't prepare
my case. "He cited problems in getting
evidence and the restricted times he is
permitted on campus. (A March 9 court
injunction has barred Franklin from the
campus except for judicial proceedings
and to gather evidence, which Lyman

has permitted daily from 1:00 p.m. to
6:00 p.m.)
The formal charges against Franklin
state that "Professor Franklin has
conducted himself in ways which have
threatened injury to persons and
property, which have denied others
their right of free speech and peaceful
assembly, and which have significantly
impaired the functions of this
University."
The charges also state that on
February 10 at a White Plaza rally,
"Professor Franklin intentionally urged
and incited students and other persons
present... to shut down the University
Computer facility known as the
Computation Center," and that later
that evening at a rally in the Old Union
Courtyard, "Professor Franklin
intentionally urged and incited other
persons present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activites of the
University community and which
threatened injury to individuals and
property. Shortly thereafter students
and other persons were assaulted by
persons present at the rally, and later
that evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Franklin has described the charges as
"total bullshit," commenting, "I make
a speech telling people to go back to
their dorms and talk to students and
that gets connected with what
happens."
Since his suspension, Franklin says
he has been mainly working on a new
book which traces leftist politics in
America from 1960 to 1970. Entitled
From the Movement Toward
Revolution, it is expected to be

released sometime this fall.
In other matters concerning the
case:
—Advisory Board member David
Levin has disqualified himself, citing his
close personal contact with Franklin.
Professor Robert Ackerman of the
English Department will replace Levin.
—Franklin has designated as his
attorneys Michael Kennedy of the San
Francisco law firm of Kennedy and
Rhine, and Stanford Law Professor
Tony Amsterdam. The administration
has chosen two Stanford law graduates,
William A. Norris and Raymond Fisher
of the Los Angeles law firm of Tuttle
and Taylor to represent it.
-The Advisory Board has been
holding meetings concerning what
Chairman David Mason called
"procedural questions" in the case.

my case. "He cited problems in getting
evidence and the restricted times he is
permitted on campus. (A March 9 court
injunction has barred Franklin from the
campus except for judicial proceedings
and to gather evidence, which Lyman

has permitted daily from 1:00 p.m. to
6:00 p.m.)
The formal charges against Franklin
state that "Professor Franklin has
conducted himself in ways which have
threatened injury to persons and
property, which have denied others
their right of free speech and peaceful
assembly, and which have significantly
impaired the functions of this
University."
The charges also state that on
February 10 at a White Plaza rally,
"Professor Franklin intentionally urged
and incited students and other persons
present... to shut down the University
Computer facility known as the
Computation Center," and that later
that evening at a rally in the Old Union
Courtyard, "Professor Franklin
intentionally urged and incited other
persons present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activites of the
University community and which
threatened injury to individuals and
property. Shortly thereafter students
and other persons were assaulted by
persons present at the rally, and later
that evening other acts of violence
occurred."
Franklin has described the charges as
"total bullshit," commenting, "I make
a speech telling people to go back to
their dorms and talk to students and
that gets connected with what
happens."
Since his suspension, Franklin says
he has been mainly working on a new
book which traces leftist politics in
America from 1960 to 1970. Entitled
From the Movement Toward
Revolution, it is expected to be

released sometime this fall.
In other matters concerning the
case:
—Advisory Board member David
Levin has disqualified himself, citing his
close personal contact with Franklin.
Professor Robert Ackerman of the
English Department will replace Levin.
—Franklin has designated as his
attorneys Michael Kennedy of the San
Francisco law firm of Kennedy and
Rhine, and Stanford Law Professor
Tony Amsterdam. The administration
has chosen two Stanford law graduates,
William A. Norris and Raymond Fisher
of the Los Angeles law firm of Tuttle
and Taylor to represent it.
-The Advisory Board has been
holding meetings concerning what
Chairman David Mason called
"procedural questions" in the case.
Suspended English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin's hearing before the
Faculty Advisory Board will probably
be in late May. However no official
date has been set for the case of the
Maoist Melville scholar whom President
Lyman suspended on February 15 and
who faces possible dismissal.
James Siena, legal advisor to the
President, and Advisory Board
Chairman David M. Mason have both
indicated they hope to have
preliminary meetings between all
parties in the case in early May, with
the actual hearings beginning later that
month.
President Lyman formally filed
charges against Franklin over a month
ago, and Franklin has recently charged
that his case a dormant issue on campus
in recent weeks is being purposefully
"stalled" by the administration. "I
think they're trying to put things off
until dead week or finals week," he
explained.
Siena denied the charge however,
claiming that "there has been no
attempt on the part of the
administration to delay the case." Siena
added that Franklin's attorney was
currently tied up with several other
cases, and that had been the principle
reason for the delay.
Franklin says however, "The main
delay right now is that 1 can't prepare
my case. "He cited problems in getting
evidence and the restricted times he is
permitted on campus. (A March 9 court
