# BSU Issues New Demands
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
At a rally held yesterday in White
Plaza, Willie Newberry, central
committee chairman of the BSU,
relayed a revised set of "black
reparations demands" to President
Lyman, and requested that he and
other administrators meet with BSU
negotiators, Monday, May 3.
About 200 people attended the
noon rally where they heard speakers
including Leo Bazile, former BSU
chairman, and Chris Lowery of the
Black Liberation Front discuss the
problem of "institutional racism" and
also the events surrounding the
Hospital sit-in of April 8-9. Later a
group of about 75 people led by
Newberry, marched to the President's
office where they delivered a copy of
the demands of Presidential Assistant
Wayne Price. Supporters had picketed
his office earlier in the morning.
At the rally, Newberry indicted the
"Stanford, so-called academic
community," for what he termed "its
complicity either by silence or by
ignorance in the perpetuation of a
racist system." He cited the university's
corporate ties with the government in
South Africa as an example.
Newberry also strongly criticised
"this liberal, responsible, non-racist
community" for "allowing" Professor
William Shockley, whose studies of
genetic factors in intelligence have
labled blacks as inferior, to teach here.
3-Day Convocation
As a means by which to begin to
find a solution to institutional racism at
Stanford, Newberry announced that
the BSU is calling for a three day
convocation to deal with racism,
imperialism and political victimization.
Mike Dawson, BSU co-chairman and
chairman of the Student Senate, said
the exact date of the conference will
depend on the reply they receive from
President Lyman.
The revised set of Black Reparations
Demands, is a consolidation of at least
three sets of demands including the
hospital demands, and the BSU's set of
22 demands issued last February.

New demands include the
establishment of "notsimply a Black
Studies program that is set up for white
folks to study blacks," but an Institute
for Black Studies, which would contain
both graduate research and
undergraduate programs. The demands
also include a percent increase in black
admissions by the Fall of 1972,
dropping charges against all those
arrested at the hospital sit-in, black
monitoring and enforcement of equal
opportunity policies, ending
"complicity with racist corporate
policies," and the paying of reparations
to the black community east of
Bayshore for Willow Expressway
displacement and the "discriminations
derived from Stanford's
Industrial Park Development."
Supporters plan to picket the Old
Union beginning at 9:00 a.m. this
morning.

consisting of one Black admissions officer,

graduate student, and one Black
undergraduate student screen all Black

Admissions approves a final roster of Black
Stanford admittees.
2) that superior quality, rather than
quantity of academic work be emphasized
such that Black students be required to
complete nine units per quarter during their
first year of study • the number of required
units to increase during subsequent years of
study; and that this become retroactively
effective for Spring quarter 1971.

quasi-academic concerns peculiar to Black
