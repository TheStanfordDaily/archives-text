### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - A blonde
19-year-old peace worker, from
Atherton, arrested on a Washington
rooftop by FBI agents, was held
yesterday as a material witness in the
March 1 bombing of the U.S. Capitol.
The girl, Leslie Bacon, was held in
$100,000 bond after authorities said
she had been under grand jury
investigation in Seattle, Wash., in
connection with national security
matters, including the Capitol bombing.
A federal judge refused to reduce
the amount of her bond or quash the
warrant for her appearance before a
Seattle Grand jury.
In Atherton, Calif., the girl's
mother, Mrs. John Bacon, said her
arrest was "all a big mistake."
"She hasn't done anything. I know
that," Mrs. Bacon said. It was the first
arrest in the case.
Denied their request for a reduction
in bond, attorneys for the girl applied

to the U.S. Court of Appeals for a writ
of habeas corpus which blocked her
transfer to Seattle pending a hearing
Thursday.
Miss Bacon, the eldest of eight
children of an Atherton lumber dealer,
was not charged with direct
participation in the bombing. The
government said her arrest as a material
witness was to assure her appearance
before the grand jury.
The warrant for her arrest and a
subpoena for her appearance Vfore the
Seattle grand jury were issued last
Thursday by U.S. District Court Judge
George H. Boldt of Seattle. Documents
accompanying the warrant said Miss
Bacon has "personal knowledge of the
circumstances and the persons
responsible," for alleged crimes under
investigation by the grand jury.
Appearing before Judge John J.
Sirica in U.S. District Court here. Asst.
U.S. Attorney Harold Sullivan said the
Seattle investigation involves "matters
of national security, including the
bombing of the U.S. Capitol."
