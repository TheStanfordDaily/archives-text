### 
More than 1500 American Indian families are expected
to converge on the intramural fields Saturday for a two-day
American Indian dance honoring the 300 Native American
victims of the Wounded Knee massacre of 1890.
The dance, which is sponsored by the Stanford
American Indian Organization (AIO), will commemorate
the members of a mystical religious movement who were
crushed by the United States Army at Wounded Knee
Creek, South Dakota.
"We would like people to realize that My Lai is nothing
new," explained John White, the president of the Stanford
chapter of AIO. In addition to this tribute, the dance
display the American Indian culture to the local
community.
The pow-wow, which will be highlighted by tribal
dancing and religious services, will host Indians from as far

as Montana, Oklahoma, and New Mexico. Tents and teepees
will be pitched on the grass near El Camino Real, and food
will be provided by several local church groups.
Beginning at 1:00 p.m. Saturday, inter-tribal dancing
competition will be held. Prizes totalling $2,000 will be
awarded for nine categories of dancing. George Woodard, a
Sioux Indian from San Jose, will preside over Saturday's
festivities. Woodard had relatives who were killed at
Wounded Knee.
"If the representatives of the Pit River tribe, or the
Hoopas arrive," said White, "we will give them time to
speak about their struggles." The Pit River tribe engaged in
a battle with Federal Rangers over a land dispute last
November, and is currently facing felony charges. The
Hoopas are resisting Governor Reagan's plan to dam their
rivers.
