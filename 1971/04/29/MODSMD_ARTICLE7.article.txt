# Vitamin C: Nutritional Fairytale?
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Can a winner of two Nobel prizes be engaged in research which is nothing more
than what one critic calls a "nutritional fairytale?"
A Harvard professor of nutrition, Frederick Stare, recently wrote in Nutrion
Today that Linus Pauling, author of Vitamin C and the Common Cold, is "like
Hansel and Gretel . . . lost in the woodsâ€”of health and nutrition, areas outside his
competence."
In his book Pauling claims that the recommended daily allowance of Vitamin
C, 60 Milligrams, is far below the optimum intake leading to the best health of a
person. Depending on the individual, infectious diseases such as the common cold
can be prevented and alleviated by an intake of 500 to 10,000 mg of Vitamin C
per day.
The orthodox view of the medical profession, which Dr. Stare holds, is that
"there is no conclusive evidence that ascorbic acid has any protective effect on the
common cold in healthy people not depleted of ascorbic acid (Vitamin C)."
Pauling thinks this is wrong. In a recent interview he said, "The reaction in the
medical profession has been more conservative than I expected. Statements made
by physicians have been to the effect that there isn't enough evidence to justify
the statements that I make.
"There are no studies with statistical significance which show that Vitamin C
does not have the amount of protective effect that I ascribe to it."
Dr. Russel V. Lee, founder of the Palo Alto Medical Clinic, criticizes Pauling
for putting his thoughts into print before the evidence was conclusive. "Linus

spoke a little out of turn," he sayd. "His evidence for the efficacy of Vitamin C is
dubious."
But there is "good evidence that Pauling has a point," he adds. Or. Lee, who
has been taking 500 mg of Vitamin C for several years and has not had a cold,
would like to see a large scale study done at the Cowell Health Center with the
dosages Pauling recommends.
The director of Cowell, Dr. James McLenehan, has no plans for such a major
study, which would take two or three years. However, he does not rule out the
possibility.
At the moment, doctors at Cowell are not greatly impressed by the claims of
Pauling's book. Moderate doses of Vitamin C, around 200 mg, have often been
suggested as a possible remedy for colds in the past. "I personally have told people
to try it, and if it works, fine," says McClehehan.
As for doses around 2000 mg, his opinion is that "the amount of
documentation for the success of that regimen is quite slim."
Approach Admired
Pauling's supporters admire not so much his evidence as his approach to the
problem. Dr. Cortez Enloe, editor of Nutrition Today, says,"The little book is
provocative ... it should be read by everyone seeking cures for baffling diseases.
"One of the obstacles in medical research is that we have little patience with
theory and a divine faith in proof."
One of Pauling's theories is that prehistoric man, through his vegetarian diet,
consumed about 2500 mg of Vitamin C each day. Since man is one of the few
living creatures which does not produce this vitamin on its own, Pauling thinks
2500 mg is a good guess for the optimum daily intake.
Pauling's interpretation of several studies on the effect of Vitamin C in
reducing the incidence of colds forms the factual basis of his argument, however.
The average intake for the experiments was small by Pauling's standards, around
200 mg, but he says, "Rather to my surprise, I found the evidence was
overwhelming for a protective effect."
Public Reaction
What has the public's reaction been? Pauling's book was an immediate
bestseller, after several weeks of pre-publication publicity. However, a sampling of
pharmacists in the area do not think his book has had any permanent effect on
their sales.
One druggist says, "Most people knew about Vitamin C before the book was
published." Sales of the vitamin have seen a particular upsurge in the past five
years, says another who observed a "noticeable increase" when the book came
out.
As for traditional cold medicines, Pauling has one great objection to them:
they are not substances found naturally in the human body, and can be toxic if an
overdose is taken. This is his objection to a new drug, NPT-10381, which was

discovered at the Chicago Medical School and is supposed to be effective against
virus diseases.
Food Not Drug
Vitamin C is a food, Pauling says, not a drug. So far, no serious side effects
have been discovered from taking large amounts of the substance.
In fact, it is such a common substance for the body, that he thinks it may be
useful in reducing the severity of such diseases as tonsilitis, pneumonia,
rheumatism, and infectious hepatitis. It is all part of what he calls orthomolecular
medicine.
In a paper published three years ago in Science titled "Orthomolecular
Psychiatry," Pauling contended that "varying the concentrations of substances
normally present in the human body may control mental disease."
He finds that a deficiency of Vitamin 812, for example, can case severe
symptoms of mental disorder. The treatment, as in many other cases, is for the
patient to take abnormally large amounts of the vitamin to compensate for
whatever is causing the deficiency in his body.
Pauling finds that the medical world is generally skeptical of his apparently
simple remedies for complicated and little understood diseases such as the
common cold. "At times in the scientific world it is possible to carry out an
experiment which will prove or disprove an idea." he says. "In the medical field it
is harder."
But it is clear that his ideas about Vitamin C's effect on colds did not come out
of the blue. His book, he says, "could have been published 25 years ago if
someone had been on the lookout and made a careful study of the evidence. He
might wf 11 have reached the same conclusion that I reached."
