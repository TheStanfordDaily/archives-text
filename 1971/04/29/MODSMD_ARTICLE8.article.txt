# 'We are all guilty'
## Responsibility For Atrocities 
### 
The recent articles by Chris
Hocker and Scott Burke entitled
"Responses to 'We Are All Guilty'"
contain factual innacuracies.
More importantly, tney fail to
address themselves to the essential
purpose of examining
complicity—that is, to end it.
Chris Hocker's rationalization
of the problem by asserting "that
I was never guilty in the first
place" overlooks the reality of
guilt (the body of evidence is
overwhelming) and that the only
way to end this guilt is to work to
rectify those conditions which
generate it.
Scott Burke raises the idea that
we are not legally guilty. The
existing precedents of law are
derived from the Charter of the
International Military Tribunal
(London, 1945), Control Council
Law Number 10 (see Trials of War
Criminals Before the Nuremberg

Military Tribunal Under Control
Council Law No. 10, Nuremberg,
October, 1946 - April, 1949), the
judgements at Nuremberg (see
also Trial of the Major War
Criminals Before the International
Military Tribunal, Nuremberg,
1 94 7), and the United Nation's
Document "Formulation of the
Principles of Nuremberg,"
adopted unanimously at the
suggestion of the United States
(U.N. General Assembly Official
Records, 5 th Session, Supplement
11). Control Council Law Number
10 states in Article II:
"2. Any person without regard
to nationality or the capacity in
which he acted, is deemed to have
committed a crime as defined in
paragraph 1 of this Article, if he
was (a) a principal or (b) was an
accessory to the commission of
any such crime or ordered or
abetted the same or (c) took a
consenting part therein or (d) was
connected with plans or
enterprises involving its
commission or (e) was a member
of any organization or group
connected with the commission of
any such crime. . .
4. (a) The official position of
any person, whether as Head of
State or as a responsible official in
a Government Department, does
not free him from responsibility
for a crime or entitle him to
mitigation of punishment, (b) The

fact that any person acted
pursuant to the order of his
Government or of a superior does
not free him from responsibility
for a crime, but may be
considered in mitigation."
By this law, Scott is right in
saying that we stand little chance
of punishment, but incorrect in
asserting that we are therefore not
guilty. It remains for each of us to
grapple with the responsibility we
bear for our nation's atrocities
abroad.
' "There exists a solidarity
among men as human beings that
makes each co-responsible for
every wrong and every injustice in
the world, especially for crimes
committed in his presence or with
his knowledge. If 1 fail to do
whatever I can to prevent them, I
too am guilty.'" — Karl Jaspers
The Question of German Guilt,
1947.
The important point in any
examination of complicity should
be to end it—because it is
ridiculous to be "against the war"
and still participate in those
processes and organizations which
are directly making the slaughter.
Any legal analysis serves to
provide a basis for fighting
repercussions of attempts to end
complicity in the courts and to
satiate the demands that we
respect the so called right of the
military and war corporations to

Ed jackson, bob bone

use Stanford lands and funds.
Why is it that we now have a
"New Two-Year ROTC Program"
at Stanford, in spite of clear-cut
votes by both students and
faculty?
Why is it that Stanford lands
are used by major war companies?
Independent of any polemics
on "guilt," we must recognize
how we and our community are in
complicity with the atrocities, and
act to rectify this situation.
Specifically on campus:
1. Resist the 10 percent
telephone tax.
2. Canteen Corp., operator of
campus vending machines and
food trucks, is a wholly owned
subsidiary- of IT&T (which has
$217.3 million in military
contracts).
R.J. Reynolds Industries
(makers of Camel, Winston,
Salem, Doral, and Tempo
cigarettes, Prince Albert, Carter
Hall, George Washington, Maderia,
and Top smoking tobaccos, and
M-T-Fine, Patio, Chun King, and
Coronation Foods) is also an
important war company,
providing shipping services vital to
the war effort ($106.5 million in
military contracts).
Boycott these and other major
war contractors.
3. Demonstrate against and
speak to the Representatives of
the military and war corporations
when they come here to recruit.
4. Act to implement the
decisions on campus recruiting
and ROTC.

The important point in any
examination of complicity should
be to end it—because it is
ridiculous to be "against the war"
and still participate in those
processes and organizations which
are directly making the slaughter.
Any legal analysis serves to
provide a basis for fighting
repercussions of attempts to end
complicity in the courts and to
satiate the demands that we
respect the so called right of the
military and war corporations to

Why is it that we now have a
"New Two-Year ROTC Program"
at Stanford, in spite of clear-cut
votes by both students and
faculty?
Why is it that Stanford lands
are used by major war companies?
Independent of any polemics
on "guilt," we must recognize
how we and our community are in
complicity with the atrocities, and
act to rectify this situation.
Specifically on campus:
1. Resist the 10 percent
telephone tax.
2. Canteen Corp., operator of

food trucks, is a wholly owned
subsidiary- of IT&T (which has

contracts).
R.J. Reynolds Industries
(makers of Camel, Winston,
Salem, Doral, and Tempo

Boycott these and other major

Hocker and Scott Burke entitled

contain factual innacuracies.

Chris Hocker's rationalization
of the problem by asserting "that
I was never guilty in the first

guilt (the body of evidence is
overwhelming) and that the only
way to end this guilt is to work to
rectify those conditions which
generate it.
