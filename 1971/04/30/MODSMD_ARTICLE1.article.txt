# Father Duryea A Moral Activist
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
"I believe that it is a moral
obligation to act on local problems, on
world problems, on all
problems.. . What you do — whether
you adopt a strategy of violence or
nonviolence . . . this is a tactical, not a
moral question."
The little office on the third floor of
the Clubhouse is cluttered with neat
piles of anti-war and radical literature.
A Black Panther Party poster is on one
wall; "The Spirit of the Lord is
Freedom" is on another. There is a
little picture of some anonymous
mountain taped to the side of the desk.
"I myself would be
non-violent.. . but that is not so much
a moral problem as a tactical one."
Father John Duryea smiles a wide,
calm smile and presses his gaunt,
son-browned hands together. His eyes
are clear and penetrating as he awaits
the next question. Fifty-three years of
age, the white-haired (and
white-sideburned) priest posesses
extraordinary youth and what some
members of his community have called
"the demeanor of a saint." He wears
them easily.
"Pop"
Father Duryea (the girls call him
"Pop") is Roman Catholic chaplain
here, pastor of St. Ann's University
Parish, activist, hiker, naturalist,
adamant conservationist. He also has a
younger brother: Father Robert
Duryea, the Pacifica priest who was
married seven years ago and chose to
remain a priest. Only a few months ago,
San Francisco's Archbishop Joseph T.
McGucken got wind of the rumors that
one of his priests had a wife and child.
He asked the popular "Father Bob" to
resign quietly; Duryea refused, and two
weeks ago McGucken announced that
he had been automatically
excommunicated — barred from
receiving communion as a Catholic.
Last Sunday, Father Robert Duryea,
his wife, and his five-year-olf son Paul
received Catholic communion in
Stanford's Memorial Church from
Father John Duryea.

"I don't believe the
excommunicato means anything,"
the elder Duryea told the Daily. "It's
just a device the Church has used to
suppress dissent."
"Thank goodness it doesn't work
now," he said at Sunday Mass, "for it is
entirely contrary to Our Lord's
prescription not to judge."
Brother's Decision
About his brother's decision to
marry and remain in the Church as a
priest, Duryea answered readily but
quietly. "I have great respect for Bob's
moral integrity — his decision was
carefully made... It wasn't a
long-range plot to smash the celibacy
law; he fell in love, and he got
married . . . And he got years of good
work in, which otherwise would have
been lost."
John Duryea is not married — nor,
he says with a grin, will he ever be: "I
love too many girls to pick one out."
But, like his brother, he is a "Vatican II
priest." His stance on
excommunication makes that clear.
He has not always been that way. "I
have changed, of course, in relation to
the changes going on in the world," he
notes. "I can look back on what I
counselled people ten years ago, and I
wouldn't say the same things to them
now. There are rules that I thought
were important at one time that I no
longer consider important... As
society moves and you move, you make
adjustments."
Born in Palo Alto, the son of two
Stanford graduates, (his maternal
grandfather was Vice-President of the
University). Duryea also entered
Stanford, but entered the seminary
after a year. He had long considered the
priesthood — but "Western Civilization
really got me interested in theology,"
he smiles. In 1950 he became chaplain
at San Jose State College. He moved to
Stanford in 1961: "The transfer here
was arbitrary .. . but I was excited to
come back."
Duryea now lives with fifteen
students at the Newman Center on
Cowper Street in Palo Alto. An early

attempt at forming an interfaith
Christian commune was "much too
self-conscious;" now says Duryea, "It is
in fact a very good communal living
experience."
Variety of Service
The Catholic community here is
served with a variety of services — one
of which includes Gregorian chant —
anti-war speakers at the Newman
Center, social action programs, retreats,
hiking expeditions in the Sierras, and
Monday UCCM (United Christian
Campus Ministry) lunches at the
Clubhouse on campus. And there is a
spirit of ecumenism apparent,
demonstrated at the interfaith UCCM
lunches, by the many non-Catholics
who attend Duryea's services, and in his
more-than-amiable relations with other
religious groups. "The differences of
structure aren't that essential," Duryea
urges. "We can let them slide."
There is as well some of the
excitement of a Church undergoing

profound change — and Duryea's
active, growing congregation for the
most part shares the excitement.
"Newman" is something of a center for
community social and political activity
in Palo Alto. Duryea himself is often
the focal point; "He is" one student
says, "one of the comparatively few
priests who truly merits the title
'Father'."
Father John Duryea continues to
press for change in his Church. He
believes that a change in the celibacy
rule is inevitable; it will come "soon
after the next Pope comes in," he
predicts. The fate of priests like his
brother? "Reinstatement will probably
come."
And the Church itself? "I think that
the Church is where the people
are . . . The community of shared faith
is the Church, not the bishops and the
popes.
"It is changing now, and it will
continue to change."

He asked the popular "Father Bob" to
resign quietly; Duryea refused, and two
weeks ago McGucken announced that
he had been automatically
excommunicated — barred from
receiving communion as a Catholic.
Last Sunday, Father Robert Duryea,
his wife, and his five-year-olf son Paul
received Catholic communion in
Stanford's Memorial Church from
Father John Duryea.

"I don't believe the
excommunicato means anything,"
the elder Duryea told the Daily. "It's
just a device the Church has used to
suppress dissent."
"Thank goodness it doesn't work
now," he said at Sunday Mass, "for it is
entirely contrary to Our Lord's
prescription not to judge."
Brother's Decision
About his brother's decision to
marry and remain in the Church as a
priest, Duryea answered readily but
quietly. "I have great respect for Bob's
moral integrity — his decision was
carefully made... It wasn't a
long-range plot to smash the celibacy
law; he fell in love, and he got
married . . . And he got years of good
work in, which otherwise would have
been lost."
John Duryea is not married — nor,
he says with a grin, will he ever be: "I
love too many girls to pick one out."
But, like his brother, he is a "Vatican II
priest." His stance on
excommunication makes that clear.
He has not always been that way. "I
have changed, of course, in relation to
the changes going on in the world," he
notes. "I can look back on what I
counselled people ten years ago, and I
wouldn't say the same things to them
now. There are rules that I thought
were important at one time that I no
longer consider important... As
society moves and you move, you make
adjustments."
Born in Palo Alto, the son of two
Stanford graduates, (his maternal
grandfather was Vice-President of the
University). Duryea also entered
Stanford, but entered the seminary
after a year. He had long considered the
priesthood — but "Western Civilization
really got me interested in theology,"
he smiles. In 1950 he became chaplain
at San Jose State College. He moved to
Stanford in 1961: "The transfer here
was arbitrary .. . but I was excited to
come back."
Duryea now lives with fifteen
students at the Newman Center on
Cowper Street in Palo Alto. An early

attempt at forming an interfaith
Christian commune was "much too
self-conscious;" now says Duryea, "It is
in fact a very good communal living
experience."
Variety of Service
The Catholic community here is
served with a variety of services — one
of which includes Gregorian chant —
anti-war speakers at the Newman
Center, social action programs, retreats,
hiking expeditions in the Sierras, and
Monday UCCM (United Christian
Campus Ministry) lunches at the
Clubhouse on campus. And there is a
spirit of ecumenism apparent,
demonstrated at the interfaith UCCM
lunches, by the many non-Catholics
who attend Duryea's services, and in his
more-than-amiable relations with other
religious groups. "The differences of
structure aren't that essential," Duryea
urges. "We can let them slide."
There is as well some of the
excitement of a Church undergoing

profound change — and Duryea's
active, growing congregation for the
most part shares the excitement.
"Newman" is something of a center for
community social and political activity
in Palo Alto. Duryea himself is often
the focal point; "He is" one student
says, "one of the comparatively few
priests who truly merits the title
'Father'."
Father John Duryea continues to
press for change in his Church. He
believes that a change in the celibacy
rule is inevitable; it will come "soon
after the next Pope comes in," he
predicts. The fate of priests like his
brother? "Reinstatement will probably
come."
And the Church itself? "I think that
the Church is where the people
are . . . The community of shared faith
is the Church, not the bishops and the
popes.
"It is changing now, and it will
continue to change."

CONVICTION—"The Church is where the people are," says Father John Duryea.
His brother Robert was excommunicated from the Catholic Church after a secret
marriage of seven years.
"I believe that it is a moral
obligation to act on local problems, on
world problems, on all
problems.. . What you do — whether
you adopt a strategy of violence or

"I myself would be

a moral problem as a tactical one."
Father John Duryea smiles a wide,
calm smile and presses his gaunt,
son-browned hands together. His eyes
are clear and penetrating as he awaits
the next question. Fifty-three years of

extraordinary youth and what some

notes. "I can look back on what I
counselled people ten years ago, and I
wouldn't say the same things to them
now. There are rules that I thought
were important at one time that I no
longer consider important... As
society moves and you move, you make
adjustments."
Born in Palo Alto, the son of two
Stanford graduates, (his maternal
grandfather was Vice-President of the
University). Duryea also entered
Stanford, but entered the seminary
after a year. He had long considered the
priesthood — but "Western Civilization
really got me interested in theology,"
he smiles. In 1950 he became chaplain
at San Jose State College. He moved to
Stanford in 1961: "The transfer here
was arbitrary .. . but I was excited to
come back."
Duryea now lives with fifteen
students at the Newman Center on
Cowper Street in Palo Alto. An early

attempt at forming an interfaith
Christian commune was "much too
self-conscious;" now says Duryea, "It is
in fact a very good communal living
experience."
Variety of Service
The Catholic community here is
served with a variety of services — one
of which includes Gregorian chant —
anti-war speakers at the Newman
Center, social action programs, retreats,
hiking expeditions in the Sierras, and
Monday UCCM (United Christian
Campus Ministry) lunches at the
Clubhouse on campus. And there is a
spirit of ecumenism apparent,
demonstrated at the interfaith UCCM
lunches, by the many non-Catholics
who attend Duryea's services, and in his
more-than-amiable relations with other
religious groups. "The differences of
structure aren't that essential," Duryea
urges. "We can let them slide."
There is as well some of the
excitement of a Church undergoing

profound change — and Duryea's
active, growing congregation for the
most part shares the excitement.
"Newman" is something of a center for
community social and political activity
in Palo Alto. Duryea himself is often
the focal point; "He is" one student
says, "one of the comparatively few
priests who truly merits the title
'Father'."
Father John Duryea continues to
press for change in his Church. He
believes that a change in the celibacy
rule is inevitable; it will come "soon
after the next Pope comes in," he
predicts. The fate of priests like his
brother? "Reinstatement will probably
come."
And the Church itself? "I think that
the Church is where the people
are . . . The community of shared faith
is the Church, not the bishops and the
popes.
"It is changing now, and it will
continue to change."

CONVICTION—"The Church is where the people are," says Father John Duryea.
His brother Robert was excommunicated from the Catholic Church after a secret
marriage of seven years.
"I believe that it is a moral
obligation to act on local problems, on
world problems, on all
problems.. . What you do — whether
you adopt a strategy of violence or
nonviolence . . . this is a tactical, not a
moral question."
The little office on the third floor of
the Clubhouse is cluttered with neat
piles of anti-war and radical literature.
A Black Panther Party poster is on one
wall; "The Spirit of the Lord is
Freedom" is on another. There is a
little picture of some anonymous
mountain taped to the side of the desk.
"I myself would be
non-violent.. . but that is not so much
a moral problem as a tactical one."
Father John Duryea smiles a wide,
calm smile and presses his gaunt,
son-browned hands together. His eyes
are clear and penetrating as he awaits
the next question. Fifty-three years of
age, the white-haired (and
white-sideburned) priest posesses
extraordinary youth and what some
members of his community have called
"the demeanor of a saint." He wears
them easily.
"Pop"
Father Duryea (the girls call him
"Pop") is Roman Catholic chaplain
here, pastor of St. Ann's University
Parish, activist, hiker, naturalist,
adamant conservationist. He also has a
younger brother: Father Robert
Duryea, the Pacifica priest who was
married seven years ago and chose to
remain a priest. Only a few months ago,
San Francisco's Archbishop Joseph T.
McGucken got wind of the rumors that
one of his priests had a wife and child.
He asked the popular "Father Bob" to
resign quietly; Duryea refused, and two
weeks ago McGucken announced that
he had been automatically
excommunicated — barred from
receiving communion as a Catholic.
Last Sunday, Father Robert Duryea,
his wife, and his five-year-olf son Paul
received Catholic communion in
Stanford's Memorial Church from
Father John Duryea.

"I don't believe the
excommunicato means anything,"
the elder Duryea told the Daily. "It's
just a device the Church has used to
suppress dissent."
"Thank goodness it doesn't work
now," he said at Sunday Mass, "for it is
entirely contrary to Our Lord's
prescription not to judge."
Brother's Decision
About his brother's decision to
marry and remain in the Church as a
priest, Duryea answered readily but
quietly. "I have great respect for Bob's
moral integrity — his decision was
carefully made... It wasn't a
long-range plot to smash the celibacy
law; he fell in love, and he got
married . . . And he got years of good
work in, which otherwise would have
been lost."
John Duryea is not married — nor,
he says with a grin, will he ever be: "I
love too many girls to pick one out."
But, like his brother, he is a "Vatican II
priest." His stance on
excommunication makes that clear.
He has not always been that way. "I
have changed, of course, in relation to
the changes going on in the world," he
notes. "I can look back on what I
counselled people ten years ago, and I
wouldn't say the same things to them
now. There are rules that I thought
were important at one time that I no
longer consider important... As
society moves and you move, you make
