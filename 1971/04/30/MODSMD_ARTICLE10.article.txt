(THE GREENING OF
AMERICA, Charles Reich, 399
pages, Random House, THE
GREAT ROOB REVOLUTION,
Roger l*rice, 135 pages, Random
House; HOW TO BE A
SURVIVOR, Dr. Paul Ehrlich and
Richard Harriman, 208 pages,
Ballantine Books.)
"What Is Happening To Us," in
Roger Price's words, is the theme
of these three books dealing with
the present and future course of
American society. The first is
hopeful, the second rather
gloomy, and the last, a blend of
the two, is conditionally
optimistic.
"America is dealing death,"
Charles Reich writes in "The
Greening of America." A mindless
technology is now the driving
force of our society, and its
offspring, the Corporate State,
rolls along denying the Bill of
Rights and alienating men from
their labor and from each other.
In the face of enormous social
injustice, war, racism and poverty,
Americans feel increasingly
powerless. And why? Reich
believes it is because of "false
consciousness." The way most
Americans see the world no longer
corresponds to reality.
Kinds Of Consciousness
Reich identified Consciousness
I as old-fashioned small-town
Republicanism, no longer valid in
megalopolis; Consciousness II as
reform liberalism, ineffective in a
basically irreformable society: and
Consciousness 111 as the "head" of
a new generation, of the
counter-culture, of you and me,
which will sweep across the land
and bring about its greening with
humanity and love.
While the analysis of
consciousness is the heart of
"Greening of America,"it is also
the most superficial feature of the

book. Reich's categories are
enormously broad, perhaps
beyond validity, and he begs the
question rather than demonstrate
their existence.
This is typical of the overall
"hang loose" tone of the book.
Reich seems to think that true
freedom resides in bell-bottom
pants and un-homogenized peanut
butter.
'Roob Revolution'
A more substantial and far
more entertaining book is Roger
Price's "The Great Roob
Revolution." Like Reich, Price
believes that technology
determines its own ends.
Additionally, he says, it has
produced the Roob, the country
rube turned city dweller, the
eternal plebian, mass man, who
for the first time in history is
affluent in large numbers and is
rapidly making his style of life the
dominant one in America. The
Basic Roob corresponds vaguely
to Consciousness I, as the Avant
Roob does to Consciousness 11.
Price believes that, like Rome,
America is not so much declining
and falling as it is becoming
obsolete. In that process we have
already entered the "Fun" period
when authority and morals, even
language and manners, all break
down.
Giant Kindergarten
Americans have been so
coddled by affluence,
egalitarianism and paternalistic
government that our society
resembles "a giant kindergarten
fifteen minutes after the teacher
has left the room. The big kids are
hitting the little kids, the little
kids are screaming and eating the
crayons, and everyone is peeing in
the sandbox." Even campus
protestors are little more than
"children throwing their oatmeal
against the wall."

And according to Price's
Vaporous Predictions, by the time
the country totally breaks down
in 1978, Americans will be only
too happy to welcome big daddy
Oliver Cromwell who will restore
order and divide our society into
castes, bringing about not a
greening but a brown-shirting of
America.
The reader should be warned
that Roger Price is a Smart Man, a
witty and intelligent author who
knows it and is unabashed in
frequently saying so. Not only has
he dedicated this book to
Voltaire, he sees himself as the
Voltaire of our age.
Price does have an acute
understanding of our social and
sexual mores (His Roob Sex Chart
is hilariously accurate), and he
knows how to turn a clever
phrase. (Television becomes the

Roob-Tube; vacation time, the
Roob-Move.
Spaceship Earth
In "How to Be a Survivor,"
Paul Ehrlich and Richard
Harriman contend that Spaceship
Earth is in serious trouble. Her life
support systems are being
irreparably destroyed by
exploitive economic systems. And
it's got to stop now.
One of Ehrlich's proposals is
the de-development of the United
States, which will require nothing
less than the discarding of the
Puritan work ethic, the rejection
of the high value placed on
conspicous consumption, and
their replacement by new values,
new life styles, and what Ehrlich
hails as the New Man
(Consciousness III).
He is an economic "cowboy"

turned "spaceman" who will
"pursue growth of the individual
spirit rather than growth of the
personal bank account."
Much as he feels averse to
coercion, Ehrlich admits it will
probably be necessary in the
transformation of our society. He
proposes the creation of a
powerful federal Department of
Environmental Protection that
will set national pollution
standards, regulate almost all
private and public regulatory
bodies, dictate the number of cars
and appliances a family may own,
perhaps becoming an
institutionalized Cromwell.
All three books point to an
uncertain future and indicate that
in the next decade, as Walter
Lippman so aptly put it,
"Whatever else may irk us, it will
not be boredom."
