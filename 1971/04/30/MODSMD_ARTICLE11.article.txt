## Four Frosh Sign 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's basketball fortunes
may take a turn upward in the
near future when a number of
California high school stars v nroll
here this fall. Four top cts
have signed Pacific-8 Confer .ice
letters of intent to attend
Stanford.
The four are led by high school
All-American center Rich Kelley,
from nearby Woodside High
School. The seven footer averaged
18.2 points in leading his team to
the South Peninsula Athletic
League championship this past
season and was SPAL
Player-of-the-Year.
The next player is 6-1 guard
Mark Gilberg from Coach Howie
Dall mar's alma mater, Lowell
High School in San Francisco.
Gilberg was the leading scorer in
the Bay Area this past year, with a
33.4 point average. Gilberg scored
30 or more points in 19 of 23
games this year, and 40 or more
points 5 times. He hit on 45% of
his field goal attempts and 76% of
his free throws.
The other two players are

forwards, a position where
Stanford has been weak in recent
years. Melvin Arterberry is a 6-4
prospect from Crenshaw High
School in Los Angeles. He is
described as a fine jumper. The
other forward is 6-6 Scott Trobbe
from Redwood High School in
Tiburon.
Apparently USC had a very
successful recruiting season, with
eight players having already signed
letters of intent for next year.
Among the eight is John Lambert,
a 6-11 center from Berkeley, who
Stanford was also very interested
in. Lambert led Berkeley to 32-0
and 27-7 records the past two
seasons. He averaged 22.5 points
and 21.1 rebounds this past
season. Bill Boyd, son of USC
coach Bob Boyd will also enroll at
SC in the fall. Boyd is a 6-8
center.
Surprisingly, neither California
or NCAA Champion UCLA had
any basketball players among
those athletes who had signed
letters-of-intent in the list issued
by the Pacific 8 office this
morning.

four victories this weekend against Washington and Washington State
to stay in the Pac-8 race.
