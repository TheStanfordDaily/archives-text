# Track Seeks First Win
## 
### 
The Indian Track & Field
squad will fly north to Seattle
Saturday to challenge the
Washington Huskies in quest of
their first Pac-8 win since 1969.
The Stanford contingent has
lost its last four meets, bowing to
USC last Saturday 86-56. The
Huskies, however, who finished
behind Stanford in the Santa
Barbara relays, have many of the
strengths and most of the
weaknesses Stanford has displayed
this season.
The Indians are predicted to
fare well in the distances, the
intermediate hurdles, the high
hurdles, and the triple jump.
Randy White, who put
together a 51.7 intermediate
hurdles victory against USC, has a
excellent 51.2 season mark. He
should triumph easily, and fare
well in the 440.
The mile relay squads of both
schools are evenly matched at
3:14.5 (Washington), and 3:14.6.
Both teams have recorded a 41.2
440-Relay mark.
Perhaps the best race of the
day will be in the 3-Mile, where
Stanford's ace Don Kardong (who
ran a fine 8:47.4 2-Mile last
Saturday) meets Huskie Jim

Johnson. Johnson, against Oregon
State, ran a 4:02.1 mile and
8:50.9 2-Mile. Arvid Kretz, who
has a solid 13:31.0 3-Mile effort
will also challenge Johnson.
Neither Stanford nor
Washington have any Pac-8
standouts in the 880,
Steeplechase, discuss, or high
jump, but the Huskies seem to
have the edge in these events.
Washington's Feldman leads the
Pac-8 with a 264-5 javelin mark.
