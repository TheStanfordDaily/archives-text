### 
The Stanford Golf team faces
some of its toughest competition
of the season as the Indians take
on Fresno State at 1 p.m. today
and University of Southern
California at noon tomorrow.
Both matches are at the Stanford
golf course.
Fresno State has twice beaten
the Stanford team in
tournaments. At the Fresno
classic Fresno State finished third
while Stanford was fourteen shots
back in fifth place. At the Western
Intercollegiate Classic, Fresno
finished fifth while the Cards
placed ninth.
The Tirojans, led by
ail-American Gary Sanders, are
undefeated in dual match play so
far this season. They have a fine
team and Stanford coach Bud
Finger rates the Cards as an
underdog. USC placed second in
the Western Intercollegiate
Classic, 25 shots ahead of
Stanford.
The Stanford squad, however,
is "starting to come together"
according to coach Finger. The
team will be bolstered by the
return of Pete Harpster who was
sick for both the Western
Collegiate and Fresno Classic
tournaments.
Coming off a fine team
performance in the U.S. Collegiate
Golf Championship, the Indians
could have a successful weekend.
