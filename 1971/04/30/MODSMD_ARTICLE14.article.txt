# Cards Need Sweep

Coach Ray Young's baseball
squad heads into the heaviest part
of its schedule this weekend with
two critical doubleheaders against
Washington on Friday and
Washington State on Saturday at
Sunken Diamond. Action will
begin at noon on both days.
The Indians could use four
wins against the Huskies and
Cougars to give themselves a little
breathing room in their race
against UCLA in the PAC-
Southern Division. Stanford is
tied for second with Bruins, both
teams having 3-4 records. USC,
with a 7-0 slate has first place
practically cinched, but the top
two teams reach the PAC
playoffs, so Stanford is still in the
race.
UCLA must host Oregon and
Oregon St., the leaders of the
Northern Division, in two
doubleheaders this weekend. Four
wins by the Indians at Sunken
Diamond would place the pressure
on the Bruins, who must still face
USC in a doubleheader at the end
of the season.
Washington offers tough front
line pitching, but the defense is

leaky and the hitting so
inconsistent that the Huskies are
languishing in last place of their
division with an 0-5 league slate,
and a 12-10 record overall.
Washington State will offer
more of a challenge to Stanford's
pitching crew with hitters like
Tom Heaton (.414), Bob Waits
(.388), and a team batting average
of .309. The Cougars have
amassed a 3-2 league total, and an
impressive 23-7 record on the
season.
Young plans on throwing
Bruce Schoen, Bob Kammeyer,
Bob Di Pietro, and Dan Shaw for
the weekend's games. Shaw's
ankle problems have healed,
enabling him to beat USF, 9-2, on
Tuesday, and he should be
reaching full strength against
Washington State Saturday.
Rod Boone continues to lead
the Indians in nine offensive
categories. Though his hitting
streak was ended last weekend by
UCLA, Boone has broken a
Stanford hit total record for one
season with 64, while keeping his
average at .397. The sophomore
outfielder has also clubbed eight
home runs and scored 40 runs.
