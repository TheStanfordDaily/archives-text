Three Stanford tennis players advanced to the quarter-finals in
singles action yesterday in the 71st California State Championships.
Fifth-seeded Roscoe Tanner, thirteenth-seeded Alex Mayer, and
unseeded Stanley Pasarell joined top-seed Jim McManus, Jeff
Borowiak, Mike Machette, and Tom Leonard in the round of eight.
Tanner, who downed teammate Chris Chapin to reach the quarters,
ripped Ken Stuart of Seal Beach, 6-1, 6-4. Mayer thrilled the
opening center court crowd with a 6-4, 6-4 triumph over
eighth-seeded veteran Whitney Reed. Mayer should face Borowiak,
premier player for UCLA, today.
Unseeded Stan Pasarell upset ninth-seeded Tom Brown from San
Francisco, 6-3, 6-1. John Levin had lost earlier to Brown, 7-6, 6-2.
