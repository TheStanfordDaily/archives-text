# Faculty Hears Reports On Hospital, Franklin
## 
### 
Provost William F. Miller told the
Faculty Senate yesterday that
"progress" is being made in discussions
in the hospital workers' dispute
although they are proceeding "after
some difficulties."
He added that the hospital has
"been troubled by the presence of
outside forces" in the negotiations and
"by the threats and intimidations of
hospital employees." He said there have
been four bomb threats and 18
reported intimidations of hospital
workers. Most of the intimidations have
been threats of the workers to force
them not to come to work.
"I think in spite of this the situation
is cooling and that people are now

proceeding with the discussions and
that is a very hopeful note," he
concluded.
Prof. George L. Bach, economics,
reported to the Faculty Senate that the
Advisory Board has set a target date for
the hearings on charges brought against
Prof. Bruce Franklin the latter part
of May although the Board has been
undergoing scheduling problems.
The latest scheduling difficulties,
according to Bach, arose "because Prof.
Franklin's attorney indicates that his
commitments would make it difficult
to schedule the case during the present
quarter." However, the Board is urging
"both parties" to adapt their schedules
to meet the target date of next month.
