# Uncertainties Bother Bell
## 
### BOB BACON TOM GIVEN 
University Police Chief Thomas F. Bell, Jr. is looking
for another job, and is not certain why.
Bell resigned on Monday, effective June 1, after
administrators "indicated that it would be advantageous to
both sides" for him to submit his resignation. He said
yesterday that the resignation is, "just an accumulation of
everything," but could not cite exact reasons for his
departure.
No successor for Bell has yet been chosen, and Bell
himself says of the administration that "I have no idea
what they have in mind. I have no idea what kind of a
person they are looking for, what qualifications they are
looking for, or what they want him to do. I'd be really
interested to know; it might give me more of an indication
of where I've failed in their eyes."
No Description Yet
University Business Manager Dwight Adams indicated
that no job description has yet been made for the vacant
post. "The President, Mr. Schwartz (special assistant to the
President), myself and others will have inputs as to what we
really want," he said, "but we haven't finalized that yet."
As to Bell, Adams commented, "I got a letter of
resignation, period. We have had a very frustrating situation
on police matters here for several years, and Tom decided
for his best interests that something else would be good for
him."
Frustrations
One of the frustrations may have been Bell's support for
the granting of peace officer status to members of his
department. He commented that administrators have not
yet decided whether they are truly in favor of such a move.
University administrators, in Bell's opinion, want the
police to be either security patrolmen or regular deputies,
depending on the situation.
A peace officer receives special training, and must meet
standards imposed by law. His powers include serving
warrants of arrest, serving search warrants, detaining
people, and gaining access to personal files and records. He
is paid by county, city, or district government bodies, and
his authority is rooted in the state penal code.
Deputies
As deputies of the Santa Clara County Sheriff, Stanford
policemen would have similar powers, but would be under

the authority of the sheriff. In addition there are legal
difficulties to achieving such a status.
This "vacillation," he said, has created many of the
tensions between the police and administration officials.
Bell said he wondered why University officials were
urging adoption of the legislation enabling them to employ
peace officers when they were unsure if it would actually be
put to use.
Under present state law, private corporations such as
Stanford may not employ bona-fide peace officers with full
arrest powers.
Part of the Problem
He said that the peace officer question was part of the
dispute which led to his resignation. According to him
there is a basic difference between him and University
officials over the philosophy of campus law enforcement.
"My background is in law enforcement. But I think that
the administration would prefer now not to have law
enforcement-oriented police, but rather
academically-oriented police. But I believe the day has
come when students can't be specially protected from
regular law enforcement just because they're on the
campus," he stated.
He stressed the distinction between his force and a city
police department, but also expressed the need of peace
officers on the campus.
"Campus police must realize that they are part of an
educational institution. We're trying to teach as much as
the professors are—we teach respect for law and order and
respect for the police, in addition to doing our regular job.
Because of the environment here, there is a lot of
difference between our operations and those of the city
police," according to the chief.
Crime Rise
However, Bell noted that crimes such as burglary are on
the increase on the campus, as well as the more publicized
politically-motivated incidents. He questions whether a new
chief might turn the trend around. His solution lies not in
personnel changes, but in the university community, "It
takes the cooperation of the whole community to
apprehend and prosecute criminal offenders."
He feels that more cooperation will arise from the recent
bombings on campus. "There was a greater chance of
bodily injury," he said, "I think this tends to shake people
up a little more than when it is obviously aimed at only
property destruction."
As yet, Bell has no plans for the future.
