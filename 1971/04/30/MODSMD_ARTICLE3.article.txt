# Maintains Indochina Policy
## Nixon Not Intimidated By Protest 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - President
Nixon declared Thursday night he is
not intimidated by the threats of
militant demonstrators, said peaceful
dissenters will be listened to and
insisted that his Southeast Asia policy
is the way to lasting peace.

"The Congress is not intimidated,
the President is not intimidated, this
government is going to go forward,"
Nixon told a White House news
conference carried live on radio and
television.
He said that does not mean peaceful
demonstrators will not be listened to,
but those who break the law will be
prosecuted.
Policy Not Affected
Nixon said neither demonstrations
nor congressional criticism nor a North
Vietnamese call for negotiations on a
withdrawal deadline have affected
policy. He said he considered all the
arguments, and believes his position "is
the correct one."
"I would not want to leave the
impression that those who came to
demonstrate were not listened to," he
said. "It's rather hard not to hear them,
as a matter of fact."
But Nixon said that as he saw
youthful demonstrators during
television coverage of their march, he
thought again that "my responsibility is
to bring peace, not just peace in our

time but peace in their time."
In a 33-minute news conference,
Nixon also:
—Said the administration will
comply with the Supreme Court
decision upholding the use of school
Dusing for desegregation, but said also
that it affects only situations in which
the races are separated by law. He said
the court has not yet ruled on the issue
of busing in cases of de facto
segregation.
Opposes Some Busing
He said he remains opposed to the
use of busing in situations of de facto
segregation produced by housing
patterns.
—Refused to comment on the
possibility of extending U.S. diplomatic
recognition to Communist China,
saying it would be premature to do so.
"We have broken the ice and now we
have to test the water," he said, noting
administration moves in easing travel
and trade restrictions.
—Said "I hope and I expect to visit
mainland China" at some time, and in
some capacity. But he said that is a

long-term anticipation, not the result of
any current invitation.
—Refused to speculate about a
two-China policy in the United
Nations, with both the Communist and
Nationalist governments represented. "I
will make the decision, but I'm not
going to speculate on it now," he said.
He said also it would be "completely
unrealistic" to expect the two Chinas
to negotiate their differences.
Defended Calley Intervention
—Defended again his intervention in
the case of Lt. William L. Calley Jr.,
but said he would not discuss now the
merits of the case in which Calley was
convicted of murdering South
Vietnamese civilians at My Lai because
it is under review.
—Said Vice President Spiro T.
Agnew supports the administration's
China policy, despite his privately
expressed misgivings, particularly about
the Chinese tour of the U.S. table
tennis team.
Nixon said Agnew usually falls in
behind a decision once it is made and
he expects the vice president to do so
this time.
