# Lyman Replies To BSU Demands
## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
President Richard Lyman, in a
statement released yesterday, said he
thought "no useful purpose" would be
served by a Monday meeting with Black
Student Union (BSU) leaders to
negotiate a set of "Black Reparation
Demands" issued Wednesday.
Lyman suggested instead that all
previous discussions of the BSU's
original 21 demands issued last
February, continue, "with a view to
reaching conclusions" expeditiously.

He added that the "29 sets of
demands containing 182 separate items
that the University has received this
calendar year," has led to "confusion
and uncertainty," on the part of
administrators as to how to handle the
situation.
According to Lyman, students from
the BSU had been pursuing a "better
way" of negotiating since February 23.
Lyman said he thought that progress
had been made in the talks, and felt
there that more was possible.

There was no immediate reply from
theBSU. Text of the statement follows:
On Wednesday, the Chairman of the Black
Students Union, Mr. Willie Newberry,
transmitted to me another set of demands.
This is the fourth such set we have received
from him since February 9. So far this
calendar year, the University, or some part of
it, has received from various organizations at
least twenty-nine sets of demands containing
182 separate items.
It would not be surprising if by this time
there were some uncertainty as to exactly
what has been demanded of the University,
and confusion about the rapid succession of
occasions on which a list is presented, a
deadline set for response, and indications
given that failure to respond will bring
unhappy consequences. Such an approach
doesn t work, and furthermore there is a
better way. Students from the BSU have been
pursuing this better way since February 23;
teams of them have been engaged in serious
discussions with the appropriate University
committees and officers on the substance of
the 21 demands issued on that date. For
example, academic officers and faculty are
meeting with a BSU team on issues of Black
Studies. Progress has been made, on this
subject and others, and there is every reason
to believe that more is possible.
The issuance of a whole new set of
demands at this point — some related to the
earlier 21, some not—makes a mockery of the
effort so far, and throws that effort into
confusion. No serious attempt to produce
constructive change at Stanford can proceed
on this basis. Where progress has been made,
it has come when careful consideration and
thoughtful discussion produced proposals in
which all parties at interest developed
confidence.
I see no useful purpose to be served by the
meeting called for in the set of demands
issued on Wednesday, a meeting, in effect, to
start all over again. Rather, I ask all of those
who have been engaged in discussions on the
existing agenda to continue those discussions
with a view to reaching conclusions as
expeditiously as they can.
Richard W. Lyman
President
