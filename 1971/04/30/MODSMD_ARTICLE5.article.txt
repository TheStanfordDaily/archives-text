## 
### 
66 faculty members have petitioned
the Advisory Board to intervene as
concerned parties in the case of
suspended English Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
The petition, whose signatories
include Nobel prize winning chemist
Linus Pauling and Anthropology
Professor St. Claire Drake, states that
"We, the undersigned members of the
Faculty of Stanford University,
believing that the Advisory Board
hearings in the case of Professor H.
Bruce Franklin will affect our rights
and interests individually and
collectively propose to intervene as
concerned parties."
Advisory Board Chairman David
Mason could not be reached for
comment last night.
The petition, released at a meeting
of the Faculty Political Action Group
(EPAG) last night, goes on to say, "We
fear that the unintimidated exercise of
our rights and obligations as citizens
and members of the teaching profession
may be threatened if the prosecution
succeeds in this case."
At last night's meeting of the EPAG,
attended by 125 persons, — Political
Science Professor Hubert Marshall
challenged the ideal of the neutrality of
the University charging that political
stands do not hinder academic
freedom, and that "no institution can
refuse to make commitments."

—Physical Science Professor Julien
Ripley described Stanford's complicity
with the war and charged the
University with "evasiveness"
concerning its connections with the
war.
—Anthropology Professor St. Claire
Drake condemned President Lyman's
recent statement on sit-ins pointing out
that the people who are now
condemning "non-violent coercion" on
campus were supporters of Dr. Martin
Luther King when he was doing the
same thing in the South.
