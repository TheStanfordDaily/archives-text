## University Complicity In The War 
### 
The Stanford Trustees and their appointed administrators are
mythomaniacs. Contrary to all evidence, they continually maintain
that Stanford University, although "socially responsible," is
nevertheless neutral. And, they apologetically insist that they cannot
sully that ivory neutrality by taking sides in the political controversies
of the day.
What they refuse to speak to is the fact that Stanford bears
responsibility for the single most destructive and criminal event in
human history. The war in Indochina besides being political, is
genocidal.
Stanford complicity in the war effort is well documented. KMC
(Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation) is one of the many
corporations that make up the Stanford military-industrial conspiracy.
As the 41st largest DoD contractor, it designs and produces weapons
which are employed at almost every level of offense and defense. The
following list is a brief sample of FMC projects which are being used
in Southeast Asia:
1) The Ml 13 Armored Personnel Carrier. These widely used
tanks—"the workhorse of the war"—spearheaded the invasion into
Laos.
2) The Chaparral and Vulcan surface-to-air missile
systems—scheduled for deployment. Hawk missiles surround U.S. air
bases in South Vietnam.
3) Anti-personnel weapons. The CBU-41 cluster firebomb. The
Beehive artillery projectile which explodes into thousands of barbed
darts.
4) 105 FCM river patrol boats enforce "pacification' in the
Mecong area of S. Vietnam.
5) The River Assault Flotilla, also in the Mecong, consists of an
Assault Support Patrol Boat, a Monitorboat, an Armored Troop
Carrier, a Command and Control Boat.
6) LVTP-7 amphibious assault vehicles are ready for a possible
invasion into North Vietnam.
Besides contributing to the devastation of Indochina, FMC's

products are endangering the lives of countless numbers in the United
States. A modified version of the Mil 3 tank that went into Laos was
used in an assault against a black church in Wilmington, North
Carolina. FMC continues to produce and market five out of the six
pesticides prohibited by the United Farmworkers contracts. Each
year, from the spraying of grapes, there are about 1000 deaths and
80,000 illnesses among the workers. FMC is also one of the largest
producers of phosphorous. Phosphates, which are non-biodegradable,
are known to be a dangerous source of water pollution.
For the last 2 decades management and resources of Stanford and
FMC have been significantly interconnected. At present, Stanford
University has $350,000 invested in FMC. Stanford Trustee William
Hewlett, (whose partner Defenseman David Packard is Stanford's Big
Brother in Washington), is a longtime director of FMC.
James M. Hait, FMC's Chairman of the Board is also an advisor to
the Business School. For years, Paul Davies, FMC's former Chairman,
was also managing Stanford's interests at the Stanford Research
Institute.
Stanford Students approved the People's Peace Treaty, and yet
Stanford's connections with FMC is another case in which our
community is denying this peace by contributing to the war. Nixon's
"Vietnamization" is not a plan for peace. He's withdrawing only part
of the troops, while at the same time setting up a computer-operated
"electronic battlefield," and supplying an unpopular fascist regime
with sophisticated equipment.
Unless we begin to put direct pressure on the corporations and men
among us who design and manufacture this equipment, unless we, as a
community refuse to contribute any more brainpower and resources
to all levels of the war effort, the war will not end.
And we will each have to live with the memory of the Nazi's,
Nuremburg, and our unforgivable failure to stop the genocide carried
out in our names.
About a dozen Stanford and community peace groups, ecology
groups along with the Boycott Committee of United Farm Workers
are going to FMC in San Jose on Friday to charge the corporation
with crimes against humanity, and to make demands of the Board of
Directors who will be meeting there.
The demands on FMC are: 1) Stop all war production; 2) Stop
production of phosphates for use in soaps and detergents; 3) Stop
production of pesticides banned by UFWOC; 4) Answer these charges
in a publicized debate on T.V., to be paid for by FMC.
If the directors of FMC refuse to meet these demands, Stanford
University has the moral and social responsibility to sever its ties with
FMC. The stock must be liquidated, and Trustee Hewlett must be
asked to resign for conflict of interests.
Please join the people going to FMC. Car pools will leave from
Tresidder between 11:00 and 11:30, Friday.
