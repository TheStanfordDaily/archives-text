sheer folly
Editor, THE DAILY:
I believe I am as astonished as
Dean Napier at the
recommendation made by the
University Committee on Public
Events to establish a committee to
take responsibility for the use of
Memorial Church. In my years at
Stanford I have never before seen
the Chapel so open and well
utilized by tremendously diverse
campus groups.
The regular services as well as
lectures, drama, and musical
events have been an important
contribution to the community as
a whole and they certainly reflect
the good judgment and discretion
of the Dean of the Chapel. To
curtail the responsibilities of
Davie Napier who has the respect
of most students, faculty and staff
is sheer folly.
Considering the obvious
absence of responsible,
student-oriented, inspired
leadership, I would think
President Lyman, Mr. Bachetti
and his committee members would
be standing on their heads to
make full use of the interests and
talents of Dean Napier and those
like him.

We applaud the
recommendation by the
University Committee on Public
Events (COPE) to President

Lyman that responsibility for the
use of Memorial Church be
removed from the Dean of the
Chapel, the Chapel Board, and the
Memorial Church Advisory
Committee and be vested, instead,
in a special committee. Perhaps
that committee should be COPE
itself. We trust that through the
administrative regularization of
the governance of Memorial
Church the irresponsible use of
that part of the University's
physical plant will be brought to
an end at last.
Memorial Church has been
used all too often for the
propagation of questionable and
dangerous ideas, and this must be
speedily terminated. B. Davie
Napier himself, the Dean of the
Chapel, has often been responsible
for this misuse, using the position
conferred upon him by his
ministerial robes to attack a wide
range of our national and
university institutions and
policies. We cite but one example,
quoting the very words used by
the Dean, in the hope that the
President will take this into
account when he considers
COPE's recommendations. On
Easter Sunday Dean Napier
—attacked the United States'
space program, implying that the
great investment our nation is
making in the conquest of space
on behalf of all mankind is a
waste of national resources in the
light of an alternative and cheaper
means of transportation ("Our
Father, who are in heaven . . . ")
—called for the revolutionary
overthrow of the present United

Stales government ("Thy
kingdom come . . . ")
—blatently attempted to negate
the sovereignity of the
constitutional government of the
United States of America and to
substitute a world government in
its place ("Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven .. .")
—made a pernicious attack on
individualism and the free
enterprise system, coupled with a
partisan call for a welfare state
and creeping socialism ("Give us
this day our daily bread ... ")
—assaulted Stanford's internal
judicial mechanisms and called for
the legitimization of sit-ins, strikes
and other forms of coercive
protest ("And forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us. .. ")
—called for an end to the
defense of our national interests
abroad ("And lead us not into
temptation . . . ")
—made unwarranted slurs
against President Richard Nixon
and Attorney General John
Mitchell ("But deliver us from
evil. .. ")
—directed an attack at the
President of the United States and
the Department of Defense by
calling for the establishment of a
monarchy and the surrender of
our national defense to a foreign
power, concluding with a spurious
attack on our national flag ("For
Thine is the Kingdom and the
power and the glory forever and
ever.")

senate farce
Editor, THE DAILY:
The ASSU Senate is often
assailed by conservatives as a
radical circus. Blacks and leftists,
the accusation goes, have
"politicized" the legislative body,
and run it with complete disregard
for the ASSU Constitution and
parliamentary procedure.
Tuesday's Senate meeting
indicated that no political faction
had refrained from histrionics on
the Senate floor. A very noisy
conservative walkout climaxed a
series of actions that at best
reveals a lack of political
know-how by the
conservative-moderate bloc, and
at worst vas behavior not worthy
of those who hold important
student offices. The comedy
started when Roman Buhler,
making his debut as an ASSU
Senator, attempted to vote for a
motion made by John Shoch, a
radical. His arm was slapped down
from behind by Peter Antoniak,
who exclaimed "You don't want
to vote for that, Roman!"
Buhler, to his credit, did not
change his vote. He later told me,
"Peter is a friend of mine, and he
merely wanted to tell me that I
was not voting along with those
who usually share my viewpoint."
Then came the ultimate
spectacle of the walkout. I've
since been told that the action
was an act of protest, meant to
convey disgust with the Senate's
refusal to ratify the entire results
of the ASSU elections.
Of course, Louis Humphrey,
the elections commissioner, was
not in attendence to testify that
the election was valid, but no
matter. The conservatives aligned
with the black bloc to defeat a
motion to postpone
consideration. Then, dismayed by
a subsequent, and inevitable,
motion to certify only the results
of the Council of Presidents
election, the conservatives
attempted to walk out and break
the quorum.
Tough luck fellows. You didn't
do your counting - a cardinal sin
for a legislator. There remained a
quorum at the meeting.
A conservative Senator tells me
that his cohorts actually left to go
drinking. Considering their
debacle on the Senate floor
Tuesday, I'm not surprised.

senate farce
Editor, THE DAILY:
The ASSU Senate is often
assailed by conservatives as a
radical circus. Blacks and leftists,
the accusation goes, have
"politicized" the legislative body,
and run it with complete disregard
for the ASSU Constitution and
parliamentary procedure.
Tuesday's Senate meeting
indicated that no political faction
had refrained from histrionics on
the Senate floor. A very noisy
conservative walkout climaxed a
series of actions that at best
reveals a lack of political
know-how by the
conservative-moderate bloc, and
at worst vas behavior not worthy
of those who hold important
student offices. The comedy
started when Roman Buhler,
making his debut as an ASSU
Senator, attempted to vote for a
motion made by John Shoch, a
radical. His arm was slapped down
from behind by Peter Antoniak,
who exclaimed "You don't want
to vote for that, Roman!"
Buhler, to his credit, did not
change his vote. He later told me,
"Peter is a friend of mine, and he
merely wanted to tell me that I
was not voting along with those
who usually share my viewpoint."
Then came the ultimate
spectacle of the walkout. I've
since been told that the action
was an act of protest, meant to
convey disgust with the Senate's
refusal to ratify the entire results
of the ASSU elections.
Of course, Louis Humphrey,
the elections commissioner, was
not in attendence to testify that
the election was valid, but no
matter. The conservatives aligned
with the black bloc to defeat a
motion to postpone
consideration. Then, dismayed by
a subsequent, and inevitable,
motion to certify only the results
of the Council of Presidents
election, the conservatives
attempted to walk out and break
the quorum.
Tough luck fellows. You didn't
do your counting - a cardinal sin
for a legislator. There remained a
quorum at the meeting.
A conservative Senator tells me
that his cohorts actually left to go
drinking. Considering their
debacle on the Senate floor
Tuesday, I'm not surprised.

sheer folly
Editor, THE DAILY:
I believe I am as astonished as
Dean Napier at the
recommendation made by the
University Committee on Public
Events to establish a committee to
take responsibility for the use of
Memorial Church. In my years at
Stanford I have never before seen
the Chapel so open and well
utilized by tremendously diverse
campus groups.
The regular services as well as
lectures, drama, and musical
events have been an important
contribution to the community as
a whole and they certainly reflect
the good judgment and discretion
of the Dean of the Chapel. To
curtail the responsibilities of
Davie Napier who has the respect
of most students, faculty and staff
is sheer folly.
Considering the obvious
absence of responsible,
student-oriented, inspired
leadership, I would think
President Lyman, Mr. Bachetti
and his committee members would
be standing on their heads to
make full use of the interests and
talents of Dean Napier and those

senate farce
Editor, THE DAILY:
The ASSU Senate is often
assailed by conservatives as a
radical circus. Blacks and leftists,
the accusation goes, have
"politicized" the legislative body,
and run it with complete disregard
for the ASSU Constitution and
parliamentary procedure.
Tuesday's Senate meeting
indicated that no political faction
had refrained from histrionics on
the Senate floor. A very noisy
conservative walkout climaxed a
series of actions that at best
reveals a lack of political
know-how by the
conservative-moderate bloc, and
at worst vas behavior not worthy
of those who hold important
student offices. The comedy
started when Roman Buhler,
making his debut as an ASSU
Senator, attempted to vote for a
motion made by John Shoch, a
radical. His arm was slapped down
from behind by Peter Antoniak,
who exclaimed "You don't want
to vote for that, Roman!"
Buhler, to his credit, did not
change his vote. He later told me,
"Peter is a friend of mine, and he
merely wanted to tell me that I
was not voting along with those
who usually share my viewpoint."
Then came the ultimate
spectacle of the walkout. I've
since been told that the action
was an act of protest, meant to
convey disgust with the Senate's
refusal to ratify the entire results
of the ASSU elections.
Of course, Louis Humphrey,
the elections commissioner, was
not in attendence to testify that
the election was valid, but no
matter. The conservatives aligned
with the black bloc to defeat a
motion to postpone
consideration. Then, dismayed by
a subsequent, and inevitable,
motion to certify only the results
of the Council of Presidents
election, the conservatives
attempted to walk out and break
the quorum.
Tough luck fellows. You didn't
do your counting - a cardinal sin
for a legislator. There remained a
quorum at the meeting.
A conservative Senator tells me
that his cohorts actually left to go
drinking. Considering their
debacle on the Senate floor
Tuesday, I'm not surprised.

sheer folly
Editor, THE DAILY:
I believe I am as astonished as
Dean Napier at the
recommendation made by the
University Committee on Public
Events to establish a committee to
take responsibility for the use of
Memorial Church. In my years at
Stanford I have never before seen
the Chapel so open and well
utilized by tremendously diverse
campus groups.
The regular services as well as
lectures, drama, and musical
events have been an important
contribution to the community as
a whole and they certainly reflect
the good judgment and discretion
of the Dean of the Chapel. To
curtail the responsibilities of
Davie Napier who has the respect
of most students, faculty and staff
is sheer folly.
Considering the obvious
absence of responsible,
student-oriented, inspired
leadership, I would think
President Lyman, Mr. Bachetti
and his committee members would
be standing on their heads to
make full use of the interests and
talents of Dean Napier and those
like him.

dangerous ideas
Editor, THE DAILY:
We applaud the
recommendation by the
University Committee on Public
Events (COPE) to President

Lyman that responsibility for the
use of Memorial Church be
removed from the Dean of the
Chapel, the Chapel Board, and the
Memorial Church Advisory
Committee and be vested, instead,
in a special committee. Perhaps
that committee should be COPE
itself. We trust that through the
administrative regularization of
the governance of Memorial
Church the irresponsible use of
that part of the University's
physical plant will be brought to
an end at last.
Memorial Church has been
used all too often for the
propagation of questionable and
dangerous ideas, and this must be
speedily terminated. B. Davie
Napier himself, the Dean of the
Chapel, has often been responsible
for this misuse, using the position
conferred upon him by his
ministerial robes to attack a wide
range of our national and
university institutions and
policies. We cite but one example,
quoting the very words used by
the Dean, in the hope that the
President will take this into
account when he considers
COPE's recommendations. On
Easter Sunday Dean Napier
—attacked the United States'
space program, implying that the
great investment our nation is
making in the conquest of space
on behalf of all mankind is a
waste of national resources in the
light of an alternative and cheaper
means of transportation ("Our
Father, who are in heaven . . . ")
—called for the revolutionary
overthrow of the present United

Stales government ("Thy
kingdom come . . . ")
—blatently attempted to negate
the sovereignity of the
constitutional government of the
United States of America and to
substitute a world government in
its place ("Thy will be done on
earth as it is in heaven .. .")
—made a pernicious attack on
individualism and the free
enterprise system, coupled with a
partisan call for a welfare state
and creeping socialism ("Give us
this day our daily bread ... ")
—assaulted Stanford's internal
judicial mechanisms and called for
the legitimization of sit-ins, strikes
and other forms of coercive
protest ("And forgive us our
trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us. .. ")
—called for an end to the
defense of our national interests
abroad ("And lead us not into
temptation . . . ")
—made unwarranted slurs
against President Richard Nixon
and Attorney General John
Mitchell ("But deliver us from
evil. .. ")
—directed an attack at the
President of the United States and
the Department of Defense by
calling for the establishment of a
monarchy and the surrender of
our national defense to a foreign
power, concluding with a spurious
attack on our national flag ("For
Thine is the Kingdom and the
power and the glory forever and
ever.")
