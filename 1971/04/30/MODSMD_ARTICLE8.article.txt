## Elton John Revives Real Rock 
### MACHISMO HORNSBY 
The rock music which we know and love has fallen into limbo since
the dissolution of the Sanfrancisco scene of 1966-69. Groups like the
Airplane, the Quick and the Dead persevere, but that old magic is
waning and nobody really seems to care.
Indeed, it seems that rock music is everywhere on the decline, and
the forces of Chaos and Anarchy on the upsurge. The era of the rock
music festival is dead, the innocent victim of the American media, and
with it the best of its performers — Hendrix, Joplin, and Otis Redding.
The ensuing swing toward nostalgia (a la Sha Na Na) and revivals of
the original rockers like Chuck Berry and the Delta blues greats like
8.8. and Albert King, and Albert Collins has come and gone as well,
leaving rock fans fed up to their teeth with their roots.
In an effort to revive the art, rock has received surgical transplants
from just about every other musical source, producing the febrile
outpatient forms of folk-rock, jazz-rock, rock 'n soul, raga-rock,
classical rock, and even the rock opera.
Every conceivable combination of instruments — from sitars, ouds
and tablas to flutes, violins, oboes and cellos — has been attempted,
generally with unfelicitous results. Group size has varied from three in
the Cream to over 40 in Joe Cocker's touring band, but nothing seems
to work.
Even the old icons have fallen: the Beatles have split up from
boredom and bickering and the androgynous sado-masochism of the
Stones somehow fails to appeal after Altamont.
In the midst of this decadence, Elton John emerges as one of the
few good things to happen to rock 'n roll in the past year and a half.
He already has two American albums out "Elton John" and
"Tumbleweed Connection" and although the first suffers from
occasional over-production and orchestration, certain vocal

mannerisms like "wo-oh-oh-ah-ah" between verses, and an
unfortunate tendency to mimic Jose Feliciano on "The King Must
Die," and the second is flawed by lyricist Beniie Taupin's fixation on
guns and by a general feeling of self-conscious artistry in the jacket
cover and lyrics folder design, they are two of the best records I own.
However, I will assume that you already have heard them and can
judge for yourself.
Perhaps while loitering around in the drugstore drinking chocolate
malted falcons, you have noticed Elton John's name on an album
cover which, although it resembles a soundtrack from Zefferelli's
"Romeo and Juliet," bears the title "Friends." If you were tempted
to buy it, forget it!
The album, with one or two cuts excepted, is a shuck —
unmitigated mood music and, all in all, about as interesting as Paul
McCartney's score for "The Family Way." If, however, you are
compulsive about such things and can't wait for the next American
release, your money would be better spent on his first British album
titled "Empty Sky."
The title song is catchy and driving, with Caleb Quaye getting in
some good reverb and "backwards" (i.e., reversed on tape and
over-dubbed) guitar effects.
"Lady What's Tomorrow" is a good song that is greatly enhanced
by Elton's percussive piano style, and "Skyline Pidgeon," featuring
the unlikely combination of harpsichord and organ, is melodically the
best song on the album. "Gulliver," a boy's lament at tshe death of his
dog not exactly a typical motif in rock music), is surprisingly personal
and touching.
Nonetheless, "Empty Sky" is basically a very good album; unlike
the early efforts of Hendrix and others, it is worthy of its creator and,
perhaps, of a place in your record collection.

ROCK ON
Rock music lovers and cocaine
aficionados will be pleased to hear
that Stephen Stills has taken
advantage of the beneficial effects
of California Penal Code Section
17 and has received only a year's
probation and a $1000 fine as a
consequence of last August's bust
in a La Jolla motel.
At the Fillmore this weekend,
Mike Bloomfield appears for the
umpteenth time, Chicago Slim.
Tonight and tomorrow night,
Winterland features Cactus and
Ten Years After, with guitarist
Alvin Lee asking the musical
question, "1 want to ball you all
night long?"

Tonight, Edwin Starr ("War,"
"Agent Double 0 Soul,"
"5.0.5.") opens an engagement at
Basin Street West.
Jennifer, the girl from "Hair,"
and John Stewart, the man from
the Kingston Trio and the writer
of the Monkees' "Daydream
Believer," will appear somewhere
on the Berkeley campus on
Saturday night, in a concert billed
as a "Strange Love Rite" and
sponsored in part by Greyhound
Lines, Inc. Hmmm?
And last but not least, the
aforementioned Elton John, with
Lamb and Mark-Almond, two
John Mayall graduates, will be at
S.F. Civic Auditorium on Sunday,
