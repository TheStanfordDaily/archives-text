# Serious Controversy
## GSB Minorities Program 
### JOANN S. LUBLIN (First of a two-part Series) 
More black students will graduate this June from
Stanford's prestigious Graduate School of Business
(GSB) than ever before. All eight of them.
More Chicano students are enrolled in the first year
of the GSB's Masters in Business Administration
(MBA) program than ever before. All eight of them.
The Business School classified 42 students (about 8
percent) as racial and ethnic minorities in the MBA
program and other disciplines: 28 blacks (or 4.6
percent of the total enrollment), 9 Chicanos (1.5
percent), 4 Asian-Americans and 1 American Indian
(who is 5/16 Cherokee). There are also 12 women
students, including 5 first-year MBA candidates who
think women should be considered a "minority" and
therefore eligible for the Business School's minorities
program.
"What minorities program?" asks Ron Walker, a
graduating GSB black student. "There is no program.
Just a concerted effort to recruit more minorities.
Once you get here, you're like anybody else."
A number of Business School administrators would
disagree with Walker's dour evaluation. But then again,
minority students and the Business School
administration do not exactly see eye-to-eye on a lot of
issues affecting minorities — such as admissions,
financial aid, curriculum, and minority faculty and
administrators.
Social Conscience
Minority students suspect the school is more
concerned about keeping up a "social conscience"
front than it is committed to training and funding
minorities for business. "Stanford is using us to foster
its liberal institution myth," said Bob Grayson, a black
in the first year of the MBA program.
"But we wouldn't be recruiting and offering
financial aid if we didn't feel we had a commitment to
help improve the status of minorities," says Associate
Dean Robert E. Jaedicke. Then the GSB should prove
its commitment, contend a number of minorities, by
increasing enrollment to 15 percent or 20 percent of
the school - equivalent to minority representation in
the U.S. population.
Tensions and differences of opinion are not
restricted to minority-administration relations.

Disagreements have been brewing this year among
minority groups themselves — particularly between
black and Chicano students. Like some of the women,
Chicano Business School students feel administrators
equate "minority" with "black" — and so demands of
black students get priority over Chicanos.
Before 1969-70, no minorities program even
superficially existed in Stanford's Graduate School of
Business. A student-faculty group called the Oxley
Committee formed in spring 1968 after Martin Luther
King's death, recommended that "10 Negro students"
be sought for admission in fall 1969. Until then, only
four of the Business School's 4,000-plus graduates had
been "Negroes."
The eight black MBA students and one Chicano

graduating this spring plus two black administrators -
Tom Edmonds, associate director of admissions, and
Gerard M. Peterson, assistant dean for placement — are
direct consequences of the Oxley report.
No Black Faculty
But so far, there are no Chicano administrators and
no full-time black members of the Business School
faculty. And while an active search for a black
professor was begun last summer, the Business School
faculty is hampered by a legacy of racism. There are
few blacks with Ph'D.'s in business and with needed
specialties, such as Operations and Systems Analysis.
Despite the auspicious beginnings of a minorities
program with black students last year and Chicano
students this year, future expansion of minority
enrollment at the Business School may be blocked by a
lack of funds. For 1969-70, the GSB put up $40,000
and solicited about an equal amount from companies
to provide tuition-plus fellowships for the nine
students.

But the 24 first-year MBA students this year who
are minorities receive no direct aid from the Business
School. Their tuition and 60 percent of living expenses
are covered by the Council for Opportunity in
Graduate Management Education (COGME). COGME,
funded with nearly $1 million from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, is supporting minority students at the
nation's 10 top business graduate schools.
At present, Gary Williams, assistant dean for
admissions and student affairs, is unsure about the
extent of COGME support for the 24 minority
students continuing next year. Some cutback in
COGME funds is expected. If COGME backing fell
through entirely, the $100,000 budgeted by the
Business School for minority aid would be given to the

24 second-year students. And no aid would remain for
the 25 minority students Williams is committed to
admitting for next year.
Ismael ("Smiley") Verduzco, a first-year Chicano
student, interviewed all 37 black and Chicano MBA
candidates for a paper last quarter and found they felt
that financial support for their "B" School education is
a "small but essential repayment for the many past
injustices placed upon the minority people by the
white establishment ..." Sure the aid has permitted us
to attend Stanford, points out Chicano student Andy
Resendez. "But it's like telling us, 'Aren't you lucky!'
- after eating shit for 300 years."
For some minority students, the minority
enrollment issue is not a question of financial aid, but
of the administration's priorities. "The Business School
shouldn't have much trouble finding money if they
wanted to. I don't really buy that," said Grayson. "I
think they use it as a means of keeping minority
enrollment down."

Minorities are just not the number one priority in
the Business School, says David L. Bradford, an
assistant professor of organizational behavior who is
teaching one of two minorities courses next year.
Bradford said the faculty gives more attention to
financing research and a new urban management
program — basing their decisions on "what has the
greatest long-term benefit" for the Business School.
Because of these priorities - and other unspoken
reasons - Business School administrators have so far
resisted minority students' request for a future
minorities enrollment of at least 15 percent to 20
percent. "We asked administrators for their ultimate
goal in bringing minorities into the GSB," Verduzco
recalled. "They said, l We don't like quotas.' And when
pressed further, they said there was no goal."
Quotas
Students are supposedly admitted — minority and
non-minority alike — on the basis of quality, not
quotas. "We admit the best people that apply"'
Williams said, because a fixed quota "frequently works
to the detriment of minority students."
Yet in recognition of the minority Business
students' interests, an ad hoc faculty-student
committee set up to review admissions policies will
soon ask GSB Dean Arjay Miller to approve increasing
minority enrollment.
Intensified recruiting is already being used to attract
more black, Chicano, American Indian and
Asian-American applicants to the School of Business.
Edmonds personally visited all California state colleges
with "a significant number of minority students" this
year, as well as four schools in the Southwest and eight
predominantly black colleges.
For the first time, second-year black students also
did recruiting on campuses in Oklahoma, Arizona,
Texas and elsewhere — in an attempt to find more
minority applicants. First-year minority students
(among them, 8 of the 9 Chicanos and the one Indian
registered) were not allowed on the foundation-funded
recruiting trips because "in the first year you have a lot
of work to do," said Edmonds.
The recruiting apparently paid off somewhat. One
hundred and sixty minority students have applied for
next year's MBA program, compared to 120 last year.

Before 1969-70, no minorities program even
superficially existed in Stanford's Graduate School of
Business. A student-faculty group called the Oxley
Committee formed in spring 1968 after Martin Luther
King's death, recommended that "10 Negro students"
be sought for admission in fall 1969. Until then, only
four of the Business School's 4,000-plus graduates had
been "Negroes."
The eight black MBA students and one Chicano

graduating this spring plus two black administrators -
Tom Edmonds, associate director of admissions, and
Gerard M. Peterson, assistant dean for placement — are
direct consequences of the Oxley report.
No Black Faculty
But so far, there are no Chicano administrators and
no full-time black members of the Business School
faculty. And while an active search for a black
professor was begun last summer, the Business School
faculty is hampered by a legacy of racism. There are
few blacks with Ph'D.'s in business and with needed
specialties, such as Operations and Systems Analysis.
Despite the auspicious beginnings of a minorities
program with black students last year and Chicano
students this year, future expansion of minority
enrollment at the Business School may be blocked by a
lack of funds. For 1969-70, the GSB put up $40,000
and solicited about an equal amount from companies
to provide tuition-plus fellowships for the nine
students.

But the 24 first-year MBA students this year who
are minorities receive no direct aid from the Business
School. Their tuition and 60 percent of living expenses
are covered by the Council for Opportunity in
Graduate Management Education (COGME). COGME,
funded with nearly $1 million from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, is supporting minority students at the
nation's 10 top business graduate schools.
At present, Gary Williams, assistant dean for
admissions and student affairs, is unsure about the
extent of COGME support for the 24 minority
students continuing next year. Some cutback in
COGME funds is expected. If COGME backing fell
through entirely, the $100,000 budgeted by the
Business School for minority aid would be given to the

24 second-year students. And no aid would remain for
the 25 minority students Williams is committed to
admitting for next year.
Ismael ("Smiley") Verduzco, a first-year Chicano
student, interviewed all 37 black and Chicano MBA
candidates for a paper last quarter and found they felt
that financial support for their "B" School education is
a "small but essential repayment for the many past
injustices placed upon the minority people by the
white establishment ..." Sure the aid has permitted us
to attend Stanford, points out Chicano student Andy
Resendez. "But it's like telling us, 'Aren't you lucky!'
- after eating shit for 300 years."
For some minority students, the minority
enrollment issue is not a question of financial aid, but
of the administration's priorities. "The Business School
shouldn't have much trouble finding money if they
wanted to. I don't really buy that," said Grayson. "I
think they use it as a means of keeping minority
enrollment down."

Minorities are just not the number one priority in
the Business School, says David L. Bradford, an
assistant professor of organizational behavior who is
teaching one of two minorities courses next year.
Bradford said the faculty gives more attention to
financing research and a new urban management
program — basing their decisions on "what has the
greatest long-term benefit" for the Business School.
Because of these priorities - and other unspoken
reasons - Business School administrators have so far
resisted minority students' request for a future
minorities enrollment of at least 15 percent to 20
percent. "We asked administrators for their ultimate
goal in bringing minorities into the GSB," Verduzco
recalled. "They said, l We don't like quotas.' And when
pressed further, they said there was no goal."
Quotas
Students are supposedly admitted — minority and
non-minority alike — on the basis of quality, not
quotas. "We admit the best people that apply"'
Williams said, because a fixed quota "frequently works
to the detriment of minority students."
Yet in recognition of the minority Business
students' interests, an ad hoc faculty-student
committee set up to review admissions policies will
soon ask GSB Dean Arjay Miller to approve increasing
minority enrollment.
Intensified recruiting is already being used to attract
more black, Chicano, American Indian and
Asian-American applicants to the School of Business.
Edmonds personally visited all California state colleges
with "a significant number of minority students" this
year, as well as four schools in the Southwest and eight
predominantly black colleges.
For the first time, second-year black students also
did recruiting on campuses in Oklahoma, Arizona,
Texas and elsewhere — in an attempt to find more
minority applicants. First-year minority students
(among them, 8 of the 9 Chicanos and the one Indian
registered) were not allowed on the foundation-funded
recruiting trips because "in the first year you have a lot
of work to do," said Edmonds.
The recruiting apparently paid off somewhat. One
hundred and sixty minority students have applied for
next year's MBA program, compared to 120 last year.
More black students will graduate this June from
Stanford's prestigious Graduate School of Business
(GSB) than ever before. All eight of them.
More Chicano students are enrolled in the first year
of the GSB's Masters in Business Administration
(MBA) program than ever before. All eight of them.
The Business School classified 42 students (about 8
percent) as racial and ethnic minorities in the MBA
program and other disciplines: 28 blacks (or 4.6
percent of the total enrollment), 9 Chicanos (1.5
percent), 4 Asian-Americans and 1 American Indian
(who is 5/16 Cherokee). There are also 12 women
students, including 5 first-year MBA candidates who
think women should be considered a "minority" and
therefore eligible for the Business School's minorities
program.
"What minorities program?" asks Ron Walker, a
graduating GSB black student. "There is no program.
Just a concerted effort to recruit more minorities.
Once you get here, you're like anybody else."
A number of Business School administrators would
disagree with Walker's dour evaluation. But then again,
minority students and the Business School
administration do not exactly see eye-to-eye on a lot of
issues affecting minorities — such as admissions,
financial aid, curriculum, and minority faculty and
administrators.
Social Conscience
Minority students suspect the school is more
concerned about keeping up a "social conscience"
front than it is committed to training and funding
minorities for business. "Stanford is using us to foster
its liberal institution myth," said Bob Grayson, a black
in the first year of the MBA program.
"But we wouldn't be recruiting and offering
financial aid if we didn't feel we had a commitment to
help improve the status of minorities," says Associate
Dean Robert E. Jaedicke. Then the GSB should prove
its commitment, contend a number of minorities, by
increasing enrollment to 15 percent or 20 percent of
the school - equivalent to minority representation in
the U.S. population.
Tensions and differences of opinion are not
restricted to minority-administration relations.

Disagreements have been brewing this year among
minority groups themselves — particularly between
black and Chicano students. Like some of the women,
Chicano Business School students feel administrators
equate "minority" with "black" — and so demands of
black students get priority over Chicanos.

student, interviewed all 37 black and Chicano MBA
candidates for a paper last quarter and found they felt
that financial support for their "B" School education is
a "small but essential repayment for the many past
injustices placed upon the minority people by the
white establishment ..." Sure the aid has permitted us
to attend Stanford, points out Chicano student Andy
Resendez. "But it's like telling us, 'Aren't you lucky!'
- after eating shit for 300 years."
For some minority students, the minority
enrollment issue is not a question of financial aid, but
of the administration's priorities. "The Business School
shouldn't have much trouble finding money if they
wanted to. I don't really buy that," said Grayson. "I
think they use it as a means of keeping minority
enrollment down."

Minorities are just not the number one priority in
the Business School, says David L. Bradford, an
assistant professor of organizational behavior who is
teaching one of two minorities courses next year.
Bradford said the faculty gives more attention to
financing research and a new urban management
program — basing their decisions on "what has the
greatest long-term benefit" for the Business School.
Because of these priorities - and other unspoken
reasons - Business School administrators have so far
resisted minority students' request for a future
minorities enrollment of at least 15 percent to 20
percent. "We asked administrators for their ultimate
goal in bringing minorities into the GSB," Verduzco
recalled. "They said, l We don't like quotas.' And when
pressed further, they said there was no goal."
Quotas
Students are supposedly admitted — minority and
non-minority alike — on the basis of quality, not
quotas. "We admit the best people that apply"'
Williams said, because a fixed quota "frequently works
to the detriment of minority students."
Yet in recognition of the minority Business
students' interests, an ad hoc faculty-student
committee set up to review admissions policies will
soon ask GSB Dean Arjay Miller to approve increasing
minority enrollment.
Intensified recruiting is already being used to attract
more black, Chicano, American Indian and
Asian-American applicants to the School of Business.
Edmonds personally visited all California state colleges
with "a significant number of minority students" this
year, as well as four schools in the Southwest and eight
predominantly black colleges.
For the first time, second-year black students also
did recruiting on campuses in Oklahoma, Arizona,
Texas and elsewhere — in an attempt to find more
minority applicants. First-year minority students
(among them, 8 of the 9 Chicanos and the one Indian
registered) were not allowed on the foundation-funded
recruiting trips because "in the first year you have a lot
of work to do," said Edmonds.
The recruiting apparently paid off somewhat. One
hundred and sixty minority students have applied for
next year's MBA program, compared to 120 last year.
More black students will graduate this June from
Stanford's prestigious Graduate School of Business
(GSB) than ever before. All eight of them.
More Chicano students are enrolled in the first year
of the GSB's Masters in Business Administration
(MBA) program than ever before. All eight of them.
The Business School classified 42 students (about 8
percent) as racial and ethnic minorities in the MBA
program and other disciplines: 28 blacks (or 4.6
percent of the total enrollment), 9 Chicanos (1.5
percent), 4 Asian-Americans and 1 American Indian
(who is 5/16 Cherokee). There are also 12 women
students, including 5 first-year MBA candidates who
think women should be considered a "minority" and
therefore eligible for the Business School's minorities
program.
"What minorities program?" asks Ron Walker, a
graduating GSB black student. "There is no program.
Just a concerted effort to recruit more minorities.
Once you get here, you're like anybody else."
A number of Business School administrators would
disagree with Walker's dour evaluation. But then again,
minority students and the Business School
administration do not exactly see eye-to-eye on a lot of
issues affecting minorities — such as admissions,
financial aid, curriculum, and minority faculty and
administrators.
Social Conscience
Minority students suspect the school is more
concerned about keeping up a "social conscience"
front than it is committed to training and funding
minorities for business. "Stanford is using us to foster
its liberal institution myth," said Bob Grayson, a black
in the first year of the MBA program.
"But we wouldn't be recruiting and offering
financial aid if we didn't feel we had a commitment to
help improve the status of minorities," says Associate
Dean Robert E. Jaedicke. Then the GSB should prove
its commitment, contend a number of minorities, by
increasing enrollment to 15 percent or 20 percent of
the school - equivalent to minority representation in
the U.S. population.
Tensions and differences of opinion are not
restricted to minority-administration relations.

Disagreements have been brewing this year among
minority groups themselves — particularly between
black and Chicano students. Like some of the women,
Chicano Business School students feel administrators
equate "minority" with "black" — and so demands of
black students get priority over Chicanos.
Before 1969-70, no minorities program even
superficially existed in Stanford's Graduate School of
Business. A student-faculty group called the Oxley
Committee formed in spring 1968 after Martin Luther
King's death, recommended that "10 Negro students"
be sought for admission in fall 1969. Until then, only
four of the Business School's 4,000-plus graduates had
been "Negroes."
The eight black MBA students and one Chicano

graduating this spring plus two black administrators -
Tom Edmonds, associate director of admissions, and
Gerard M. Peterson, assistant dean for placement — are
direct consequences of the Oxley report.
No Black Faculty
But so far, there are no Chicano administrators and
no full-time black members of the Business School
faculty. And while an active search for a black
professor was begun last summer, the Business School
faculty is hampered by a legacy of racism. There are
few blacks with Ph'D.'s in business and with needed
specialties, such as Operations and Systems Analysis.
Despite the auspicious beginnings of a minorities
program with black students last year and Chicano
students this year, future expansion of minority
enrollment at the Business School may be blocked by a
lack of funds. For 1969-70, the GSB put up $40,000
and solicited about an equal amount from companies
to provide tuition-plus fellowships for the nine
students.

But the 24 first-year MBA students this year who
are minorities receive no direct aid from the Business
School. Their tuition and 60 percent of living expenses
are covered by the Council for Opportunity in
Graduate Management Education (COGME). COGME,
funded with nearly $1 million from the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, is supporting minority students at the
nation's 10 top business graduate schools.
At present, Gary Williams, assistant dean for
admissions and student affairs, is unsure about the
extent of COGME support for the 24 minority
students continuing next year. Some cutback in
COGME funds is expected. If COGME backing fell
through entirely, the $100,000 budgeted by the
Business School for minority aid would be given to the

24 second-year students. And no aid would remain for
the 25 minority students Williams is committed to
admitting for next year.

Texas and elsewhere — in an attempt to find more
minority applicants. First-year minority students
(among them, 8 of the 9 Chicanos and the one Indian
registered) were not allowed on the foundation-funded
recruiting trips because "in the first year you have a lot
of work to do," said Edmonds.
The recruiting apparently paid off somewhat. One
hundred and sixty minority students have applied for
next year's MBA program, compared to 120 last year.
