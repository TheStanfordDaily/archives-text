# White Sets New Mark
## 
### 
Randy White, Stanford's ace
intermediate hurdler, set an
all-time Indian mark with his 50.7
triumph in Seattle Saturday. The
track and field squad, however,
failed in their bid to win their first
Pac-8 meet this season, losing to
Washington 81-73.
White's newest record smashed
the meet record of 52.3, held
jointly by two Washington
hurdlers; it broke the Huskie
stadium mark of 51.7; and White's
all-time Stanford best of 51.2,
established earlier this season, was
further reduced.
Only Wayne Collett, UCLA's
long-legged speedster, who ran a
51.5 earlier this season, has come

close to White in the Pac-8.
White's 50.7 may be the fastest
mark in the nation this season.
Chuck Francis, performing
nobly in the losing effort, broke
the tape with a 9.5 100, bettering
the meet record, and equalling the
stadium mark; Francis came back
victorious in the 220, recording a
fine 21.2.
As expected, Co-captain Allen
Meredith triumphed in the triple
jump, but only leaped 50'-9", and
that was wind-aided. Tim
Nicholson, running for the first
time this year, finished the 880 in
1:50.2, which may be the best in
the Pac-8 this season; his victory
bettered the meet record of
1:51.4.
