Demonstrators A rrested
WASHINGTON — Police dispersed thousands of
anti-war demonstrators throughout the city Sunday
and then braced for what militant leaders vowed
would be a return at sunrise for a massive show of
disruption.
Metropolitan police ordered upwards of 15,000
demonstrators from their Potomac Park campsite
early Sunday. About 150 who refused to leave the
area were jailed.
Another 100 persons were arrested in scattered
demonstrations and parades which followed the
eviction.
A spokesmen for the two largest protest groups,
the May Day Collective and the People's Coalition for
Peace and Justice, insisted they were undaunted in
their plans for massive traffic tieups and a march on
the Pentagon early Monday.
Bob Lamb of the May Day Collective said he was
convinced the hard core of demonstrators remained
in the city.
Nearly 1,500 persons had been arrested in
demonstrations earlier in the week. There have been
few scuffles, including Sunday, and physical damage
has been limited to the destruction of a plywood
retaining wall at the Health, Education and Welfare
Department.
Cambodian Government
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Brig. Gen. In Tam,
asked to accept the premiership and form a new
government, indicated Sunday night he was
encountering difficulties.
He said he had not been able to see the outgoing

premier, Marshal Lon Nol, and so could not yet reply
formally to Chief of State Cheng Heng's request that
he take over the reins.
If In Tarn, a popular general and president of
Cambodia's National Assembly, can form a
government it will end this young republic's 13-day
crisis, precipitated by Lon Nol's resignation. Lon Nol
suffered a crippling stroke in February.
Rogers In Jordan
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of State William P.
Rogers arrived Sunday in heavily guarded Amman
from Saudi Arabia, where he received a strong plea
for the Arab cause from King Faisal.
"We support Egypt in everything that would
support Egypt's return to territories occupied by
Israel," Faisal's foreign minister, Omar Sakkaf, told
newsmen after a two-hour meeting between Rogers
and the monarch at Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat dismissed
pro-Soviet Ali Sabry as one of Egypt's two vice
presidents Sunday night. Although the move came
only two days before Rogers' scheduled arrival in the
Egyptian capital, there was no indication the two
events were connected.
Rebel Gunman Identified
KEGALLE, Ceylon — A shadowy, limping gunman
calling himself a lieutenant's colonel of the rebel forces
was declared one of Ceylon't most wanted men
Sunday as more dejected insurgents surrendered to
the police and army.

Army guns were silent over the 640-square-mile
Kegalle district where the insurgents are making the
fiercest stand of their month-old insurrection. A
military spokesman said the lull was ordered with the
aim of persuading as many rebels as possible to
surrender before an all-out attack on their positions
hidden in dense, hilly jungle.
Police have built a picture of the self-styled rebel
colonel from interviews with captured insurgents who
identify him as a one time school teacher named
Ariyadasa, aged between 29 and 32.
Mahendran, commander of all police in Kegalle
district, 50 miles northeast of Colombo, added:
"We've enough evidence to pin eight murders on this
big shot."
. He said Ariyadesa, from nearby Tulhiriya area, led
three major rebel offensives on the night of April 5
when the insurgents launched a violent campaign to
overthrow the government of Prime Minister Sirimavo
Bandaranaike, hoping to establish a more Socialist
regime.

KENT, Ohio — Ronald Weissenberger, a former
student indicted in last year's disorders at Kent State
University, Roy D. Thompson, police chief at the
time, and Lowell Davis, member of the grand jury
which indicted Weissenberger, are seeking seats on the
city countil in primary elections tomorrow.
The primaries fall May 4, the first anniversary of
the confrontation between students and National
Guardsmen during which four students were killed.
The disorders stemmed from the U.S. move into
Cambodia. A memorial service is scheduled on
campus Tuesday.
Demonstrators A rrested
WASHINGTON — Police dispersed thousands of
anti-war demonstrators throughout the city Sunday
and then braced for what militant leaders vowed
would be a return at sunrise for a massive show of
disruption.
Metropolitan police ordered upwards of 15,000
demonstrators from their Potomac Park campsite
early Sunday. About 150 who refused to leave the
area were jailed.
Another 100 persons were arrested in scattered
demonstrations and parades which followed the
eviction.
A spokesmen for the two largest protest groups,
the May Day Collective and the People's Coalition for
Peace and Justice, insisted they were undaunted in
their plans for massive traffic tieups and a march on
the Pentagon early Monday.
Bob Lamb of the May Day Collective said he was
convinced the hard core of demonstrators remained
in the city.
Nearly 1,500 persons had been arrested in
demonstrations earlier in the week. There have been
few scuffles, including Sunday, and physical damage
has been limited to the destruction of a plywood
retaining wall at the Health, Education and Welfare
Department.
Cambodian Government
PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Brig. Gen. In Tam,
asked to accept the premiership and form a new
government, indicated Sunday night he was
encountering difficulties.
He said he had not been able to see the outgoing

premier, Marshal Lon Nol, and so could not yet reply
formally to Chief of State Cheng Heng's request that
he take over the reins.
If In Tarn, a popular general and president of
Cambodia's National Assembly, can form a
government it will end this young republic's 13-day
crisis, precipitated by Lon Nol's resignation. Lon Nol
suffered a crippling stroke in February.
Rogers In Jordan
AMMAN, Jordan — Secretary of State William P.
Rogers arrived Sunday in heavily guarded Amman
from Saudi Arabia, where he received a strong plea
for the Arab cause from King Faisal.
"We support Egypt in everything that would
support Egypt's return to territories occupied by
Israel," Faisal's foreign minister, Omar Sakkaf, told
newsmen after a two-hour meeting between Rogers
and the monarch at Riyadh, the Saudi capital.
In Cairo, President Anwar Sadat dismissed
pro-Soviet Ali Sabry as one of Egypt's two vice
presidents Sunday night. Although the move came
only two days before Rogers' scheduled arrival in the
Egyptian capital, there was no indication the two
events were connected.
Rebel Gunman Identified
KEGALLE, Ceylon — A shadowy, limping gunman
calling himself a lieutenant's colonel of the rebel forces
was declared one of Ceylon't most wanted men
Sunday as more dejected insurgents surrendered to
the police and army.

Army guns were silent over the 640-square-mile
Kegalle district where the insurgents are making the
fiercest stand of their month-old insurrection. A
military spokesman said the lull was ordered with the
aim of persuading as many rebels as possible to
surrender before an all-out attack on their positions
hidden in dense, hilly jungle.
Police have built a picture of the self-styled rebel
colonel from interviews with captured insurgents who
identify him as a one time school teacher named
Ariyadasa, aged between 29 and 32.
Mahendran, commander of all police in Kegalle
district, 50 miles northeast of Colombo, added:
