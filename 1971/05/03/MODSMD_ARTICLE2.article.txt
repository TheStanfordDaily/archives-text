# Tension In Washington As Confrontation Nears
## 
### ED KOHN 
WASHINGTON - Troops are
massing and tensions rising in
anticipation of massive traffic
blockages planned by anti-war
demonstrators here this morning.
The protesters hope to stop traffic
at 13 "key" locations, including the
Pentagon access roads, the four bridges
over the Potomac River leading into
Washington, and roads leading to the
Justice Department to prevent
"business as usual" for government
employees.
The Washington police chief has
pledged to keep the roads open, and at
least 12,000 military personnel will be
in or near the city to aid the police
department. Several hundred military
police, equipped with "VIOO's," a huge
vehicle that, according to Army
spokesmen, is capable of running over
cars, are among those being sent to the
Washington area.
Campsite Closed
Early yesterday morning, several
thousand D.C. police moved into the
demonstrators' West Potomac Park
campsite, announced their permit had
been revoked, and scattered the 15,000
campers all over the city. About 200
persons later were arrested on various
charges. Protest leaders worked through
the day to regroup their forces, and
could not forecast how many persons
would engage in shutting down
Washington traffic.
The disruptive East Coast
demonstrations began a week ago,
when nearly 1000 anti-war protestors
on their way home from the massive
April 24 rally spontaneously decided to
stop Washington-New York traffic by
sitting in, and thereby closing down,
the New Jersey Turnpike.

It was all very peaceful: near the
southern end of the road, the
demonstrators slowed to 10 m.p.h. for
a stretch. Then they stopped their cars
and spilled out into the roadway,
blocking all traffic in both directions.
For six hours, traffic had to be
rerouted 40 miles over back roads to
provide passage around the singing,
chanting assembly and its campfires.
As expected, the police massed and
moved in, and about 100 people decided
to be arrested. Most spent the night in
county jails and were bailed or bonded
out the next morning.
But most of the protest has centered
in the city itself.
Arrest Totals Mount
week, over 1500 persons were
arrested during joint Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) and
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ) demonstrations. The targets for
these demonstrations were obvious and
forebearing: Capitol Hill, Selective
Service System headquarters, and the
Departments of Justice and Health,
Education and Welfare.
The demonstrations usually
attracted several hundred participants,
most of whom were college age or
slightly older; they apparently held
little attraction for the various coalition
groups and labor unions that
participated in the April 24 rally. The

protests were generally non-violent,
although some property — mostly
barricades intended to contain the
demonstrators — was destroyed. Most
people arrested went willingly to jail,
were booked for blocking an entrance,
and were released after posting $10
collateral.
Stumbling Blocks
However, last week's demonstrations
ran into two major problems: they
failed to win any support on Capitol
Hill or from the local citizenry; and
they had little, if any, educational value
except to demonstrate that the D.C.
Police Department still acts with great
restraint when confronted with a
potentially ugly situation.
The protests slated to begin this
morning probably will serve only to
make matters worse.
The idea behind the traffic
blockades is not a new one; University
of Maryland students regularly shut
down Route 1 near Washington during
the Cambodian protests last spring.
PCPJ hopes to stop all governmental
operations until the Indochinese War is
ended. Its leaders have reasoned that

the most effective way to accomplish
this is by blocking entrances into the
city - thus stranding many government
workers who commute from nearby
suburbs to their jobs in the city.
Spearheads Moratorium
All of this, of course, is designed to
spearhead the nationwide moratorium
on "business as usual" scheduled to
begin today.
However, the demonstrators have
not exactly been helping their own
cause. SCLC and PCPJ have different
announced priorities, and their joint
efforts lack cohesive goals. The West
Potomac Park campsite - before it was
outlawed yesterday — had its problems,
too. There was a considerable amount
of stealing (food, clothing, cleeping
bags, dogs, etc.) and hard drugs were
being used in such quantities that many
persons found themselves sleeping all
day or recovering from bad trips in
nearby hospital emergency rooms
instead of protesting. One hospital, for
example, treated 101 persons during a
24-hour period.
Employees Fearful
One major result of the "Spring
Offensive" (which, appropriately,
became known as "Mayday" two days
ago) is that government employees,
among others, are becoming fearful of
the protestors and are ignoring — or
reacting hostilely to — the message that
they are attempting to present.

The Civil Service Commission (CSC),
for example, reports that it has received
numerous phone calls from employees
wanting to know in advance if their
offices will be closed this morning to
prevent violence and further traffic
tie-ups. The CSC has advised employees
that they should report for work as
promptly as possible. The Commerce
Department reportedly has asked its
employees to leave for work at 3:30
a.m. — hours before the demonstrators
threaten to take to the streets at 6:00.

the most effective way to accomplish
this is by blocking entrances into the
city - thus stranding many government
workers who commute from nearby
suburbs to their jobs in the city.
Spearheads Moratorium
All of this, of course, is designed to
spearhead the nationwide moratorium
on "business as usual" scheduled to
begin today.
However, the demonstrators have
not exactly been helping their own
cause. SCLC and PCPJ have different
announced priorities, and their joint
efforts lack cohesive goals. The West
Potomac Park campsite - before it was
outlawed yesterday — had its problems,
too. There was a considerable amount
of stealing (food, clothing, cleeping
bags, dogs, etc.) and hard drugs were
being used in such quantities that many
persons found themselves sleeping all
day or recovering from bad trips in
nearby hospital emergency rooms
instead of protesting. One hospital, for
example, treated 101 persons during a
24-hour period.
Employees Fearful
One major result of the "Spring
Offensive" (which, appropriately,
became known as "Mayday" two days
ago) is that government employees,
among others, are becoming fearful of
the protestors and are ignoring — or
reacting hostilely to — the message that
they are attempting to present.

The Civil Service Commission (CSC),
for example, reports that it has received
numerous phone calls from employees
wanting to know in advance if their
offices will be closed this morning to
prevent violence and further traffic
tie-ups. The CSC has advised employees
that they should report for work as
promptly as possible. The Commerce
Department reportedly has asked its
employees to leave for work at 3:30
a.m. — hours before the demonstrators
threaten to take to the streets at 6:00.
WASHINGTON - Troops are
massing and tensions rising in
anticipation of massive traffic
blockages planned by anti-war
demonstrators here this morning.
The protesters hope to stop traffic
at 13 "key" locations, including the
Pentagon access roads, the four bridges
over the Potomac River leading into
Washington, and roads leading to the
Justice Department to prevent
"business as usual" for government
employees.
The Washington police chief has
pledged to keep the roads open, and at
least 12,000 military personnel will be
in or near the city to aid the police
department. Several hundred military
police, equipped with "VIOO's," a huge
vehicle that, according to Army
spokesmen, is capable of running over
cars, are among those being sent to the
Washington area.
Campsite Closed
Early yesterday morning, several
thousand D.C. police moved into the
demonstrators' West Potomac Park
campsite, announced their permit had
been revoked, and scattered the 15,000
campers all over the city. About 200
persons later were arrested on various
charges. Protest leaders worked through
the day to regroup their forces, and
could not forecast how many persons
would engage in shutting down
Washington traffic.
The disruptive East Coast
demonstrations began a week ago,
when nearly 1000 anti-war protestors
on their way home from the massive
April 24 rally spontaneously decided to
stop Washington-New York traffic by
sitting in, and thereby closing down,
the New Jersey Turnpike.
Turnpike Closed
It was all very peaceful: near the
southern end of the road, the
demonstrators slowed to 10 m.p.h. for
a stretch. Then they stopped their cars
and spilled out into the roadway,
blocking all traffic in both directions.
For six hours, traffic had to be
rerouted 40 miles over back roads to
provide passage around the singing,
chanting assembly and its campfires.
As expected, the police massed and
moved in, and about 100 people decided
to be arrested. Most spent the night in
county jails and were bailed or bonded
out the next morning.
But most of the protest has centered
in the city itself.
Arrest Totals Mount
week, over 1500 persons were
arrested during joint Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) and
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ) demonstrations. The targets for
these demonstrations were obvious and
forebearing: Capitol Hill, Selective
Service System headquarters, and the
Departments of Justice and Health,
Education and Welfare.
The demonstrations usually
attracted several hundred participants,
most of whom were college age or
slightly older; they apparently held
little attraction for the various coalition
groups and labor unions that
participated in the April 24 rally. The

protests were generally non-violent,
although some property — mostly
barricades intended to contain the
demonstrators — was destroyed. Most
people arrested went willingly to jail,
were booked for blocking an entrance,
and were released after posting $10
collateral.
Stumbling Blocks
However, last week's demonstrations
ran into two major problems: they
failed to win any support on Capitol
Hill or from the local citizenry; and
they had little, if any, educational value
except to demonstrate that the D.C.
Police Department still acts with great
restraint when confronted with a
potentially ugly situation.

the day to regroup their forces, and
could not forecast how many persons
would engage in shutting down
Washington traffic.
The disruptive East Coast
demonstrations began a week ago,
when nearly 1000 anti-war protestors
on their way home from the massive
April 24 rally spontaneously decided to
stop Washington-New York traffic by
sitting in, and thereby closing down,
the New Jersey Turnpike.
Turnpike Closed
It was all very peaceful: near the
southern end of the road, the
demonstrators slowed to 10 m.p.h. for
a stretch. Then they stopped their cars
and spilled out into the roadway,
blocking all traffic in both directions.
For six hours, traffic had to be
rerouted 40 miles over back roads to
provide passage around the singing,
chanting assembly and its campfires.
As expected, the police massed and
moved in, and about 100 people decided
to be arrested. Most spent the night in
county jails and were bailed or bonded
out the next morning.
But most of the protest has centered
in the city itself.
Arrest Totals Mount
week, over 1500 persons were
arrested during joint Southern Christian
Leadership Conference (SCLC) and
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and Justice
(PCPJ) demonstrations. The targets for
these demonstrations were obvious and
forebearing: Capitol Hill, Selective
Service System headquarters, and the
Departments of Justice and Health,
Education and Welfare.
The demonstrations usually
attracted several hundred participants,
most of whom were college age or
slightly older; they apparently held
little attraction for the various coalition
groups and labor unions that
participated in the April 24 rally. The

protests were generally non-violent,
although some property — mostly
barricades intended to contain the
demonstrators — was destroyed. Most
people arrested went willingly to jail,
were booked for blocking an entrance,
and were released after posting $10
collateral.
Stumbling Blocks
However, last week's demonstrations
ran into two major problems: they
failed to win any support on Capitol
Hill or from the local citizenry; and
they had little, if any, educational value
except to demonstrate that the D.C.
Police Department still acts with great
restraint when confronted with a
potentially ugly situation.
The protests slated to begin this
morning probably will serve only to
make matters worse.
The idea behind the traffic
blockades is not a new one; University
of Maryland students regularly shut
down Route 1 near Washington during
the Cambodian protests last spring.
PCPJ hopes to stop all governmental
operations until the Indochinese War is
ended. Its leaders have reasoned that

the most effective way to accomplish
this is by blocking entrances into the
city - thus stranding many government
workers who commute from nearby
suburbs to their jobs in the city.
Spearheads Moratorium
All of this, of course, is designed to
spearhead the nationwide moratorium
on "business as usual" scheduled to
begin today.
However, the demonstrators have
not exactly been helping their own
cause. SCLC and PCPJ have different
announced priorities, and their joint
efforts lack cohesive goals. The West
Potomac Park campsite - before it was
outlawed yesterday — had its problems,
too. There was a considerable amount
of stealing (food, clothing, cleeping
bags, dogs, etc.) and hard drugs were
being used in such quantities that many
persons found themselves sleeping all
day or recovering from bad trips in
nearby hospital emergency rooms
instead of protesting. One hospital, for
example, treated 101 persons during a
24-hour period.
Employees Fearful
One major result of the "Spring
Offensive" (which, appropriately,
became known as "Mayday" two days
ago) is that government employees,
among others, are becoming fearful of
the protestors and are ignoring — or
reacting hostilely to — the message that
they are attempting to present.

The Civil Service Commission (CSC),
for example, reports that it has received
numerous phone calls from employees
wanting to know in advance if their
offices will be closed this morning to
prevent violence and further traffic
tie-ups. The CSC has advised employees
that they should report for work as
promptly as possible. The Commerce
Department reportedly has asked its
employees to leave for work at 3:30
a.m. — hours before the demonstrators
threaten to take to the streets at 6:00.
WASHINGTON - Troops are
massing and tensions rising in
anticipation of massive traffic
blockages planned by anti-war
demonstrators here this morning.
The protesters hope to stop traffic
at 13 "key" locations, including the
Pentagon access roads, the four bridges
over the Potomac River leading into
Washington, and roads leading to the
Justice Department to prevent
"business as usual" for government
employees.
The Washington police chief has
pledged to keep the roads open, and at
least 12,000 military personnel will be
in or near the city to aid the police
department. Several hundred military
police, equipped with "VIOO's," a huge
vehicle that, according to Army
spokesmen, is capable of running over
cars, are among those being sent to the
Washington area.
Campsite Closed
Early yesterday morning, several
thousand D.C. police moved into the
demonstrators' West Potomac Park
campsite, announced their permit had
been revoked, and scattered the 15,000
campers all over the city. About 200
persons later were arrested on various
charges. Protest leaders worked through
the day to regroup their forces, and
could not forecast how many persons
would engage in shutting down
Washington traffic.
