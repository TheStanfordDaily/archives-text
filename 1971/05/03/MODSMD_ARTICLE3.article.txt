# Students Quarantine Draft Board
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
Thirteen medical students and
physicians joined with a half dozen
medical students from UC Davis and
UC San Francisco in a blockade of the
Oakland selective service induction
center Friday morning. The thirteen
continued their protest for 90 minutes
with the moral support of
approximately 35 sympathizers before
they were arrested by police. Bail was
set at $1,250 for each.
Their motivations were stimulated
by the continuing warfare in
lndo-China. In a policy statement the
students said, "The high mortality rate
resulting from military induction forces
us to declare a quarantine of the
Oakland induction center as an act of
preventative medicine. According to
the Army, 'in the war to win mens
minds, medicine can be a weapon.' We
reject this perversion of medical ethics
and international law. The purpose of
medicine is to promote health and cure
disease. We despair the apalling use of

mass violence by our nation on the
people's of lndo-China. More people
are killed every week in lndo-China
than any one of us will be able to save
in a lifetime. By declaring this
induction center a public health hazard
we issue a call to Americans to place all
induction centers under quarantine."
In a letter to President Lyman
preceding their action the Stanford
Medical Community for Peace said,
"We have chosen this action as a matter
of conscience: to use whatever voice we
have to move whomever will listen."
The members of the medical
community exhibited a strong
philosophical concern that moved them
"to oppose the violence and killing in
Indochina that daily negates the
direction of our lives" and taking note
of Lyman's opposition to the War and
his condemnation of sit-ins as an
unacceptable form of protest within
the University they asked that he
"consider the importance of individual
acts of conscience as necessarv for

constructive change" and support their
acts.
To explain their tactics, the medical
center people pointed out in their
newsletter "The Axon" that the
newspaper and television coverage of
the San Jose induction center
demonstration was an effective way of
manifesting their deep opposition to
the War. They argue that the 150,000
marchers in San Francisco last week
could have been much more effective
had they blocked weapons
manufacturers and induction centers
instead.
