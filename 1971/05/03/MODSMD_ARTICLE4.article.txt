# Junipero Residents 'Paranoid' After Fire
## 
### DOYLE McMANUS 
Only one week after early-morning
arson destroyed their lounge, many
Junipero House residents display mixed
emotions towards their unknown
attackers.
"We're not all that upset about it,"
says one.
But the combination of the lounge
fire, an earlier trash fire that may have
been deliberately set, and a bomb
threat on the car of one of the house's
black members, has many at Junipero
sleeping scared.
Declares Hillary Rowen, a freshman,
"I'm paranoid. I'm permanently
paranoid. But 1 didn't get paranoid
until Thursday (the day of the bomb
threat) I was just scared after the fire."
Says Mark Pengilly, a sophomore:
"We've started thinking that someone's
trying to kill us."
"I'm from Texas- I'm used to this
sort of thing," says- Ken Curl, a
freshman and a Black Students' Union
member.
"I'm not angry; I'm just concerned
that people's lives have been
endangered."
"Some people here are still
frightened," says freshman Bob
Fogerson, "but I think that Ken put it
best — people are just concerned."
Their concern could not be more
real. Junipero is now patrolled by
residents 24 hours a day; between
midnight and 6:00 a.m., the building is
circled at least once every 15 minutes
by patrols equipped with field
telephones. And, in many minds, there
is good reason for this concern: the
house was a target of violence in the
past, and this particular action came
perilously close to being a fatal one.
While almost none of the residents
feel they have enough information to

accuse anyone of setting the fire, the
majority suspect the radical right.
"What strikes me," says Fogerson,
"is the fact that last year in Junipero
there were death threats to blacks, and
several swastikas were painted on
doors. The black residents of Junipero
have been targets before. It's not
insignificant that the BSU (which had
held several meetings in the lounge) has
been more active this year than last.
That fire didn't exactly happen in a
vacuum."
Junipero has an estimated 16 BSU
members, one member of the Black
Liberation Front, from two to four
Venceremos members, and up to four
former members of the conservative
Free Campus Movement. "We probably
have more political people for as small
a place as this than anywhere else on
campus," one girl declares.
But, says Rett Ertl, a senior, "I have
no idea who did it, and 1 don't think
anyone else does."
Pengilly agrees. "I think it would be
rash to conjecture who did it,"he says,
"and I resent President Lyman's
attempt to impute it to any
organization. The same goes for
Venceremos."
"Nobody should be accused at all,"
Fogerson declares. "People who are
pointing fingers are doing so for their
own political gain . . . (Lyman) doesn't
really care whether it was Venceremos
or not, he just wants to pull out as
much ammunition against them as he
can."
One girl is more certain. "I think it
was some off-campus fascist group,"
she declares.
"I think God did it," Pengilly
declared. "Why would anyone attack
such a fun-loving dorm?"
Reactions from other Wilbur Hall
residents are somewhat mixed.
"Everybody's already locking their
doors when they go out for a drink of
water," one Cedro House resident says.
"People are getting pretty fed up.
I'm not going to live in the Wilbur
complex again. We've got people on the
third floor who are tying ropes to their
beds in case they have to escape a fire."
A Madera sponsor sees a change in
'consciousness' as a result of the fire,
but no lasting fear.
"It very much changes the mood of
the Wilbur complex and when the
strength of revolutionary fervor comes
that close, it changes people's
consciousness quite a little. It meant a
lot more than just burning an academic
building ... As for paranoia, 1 think
it'll be forgotten within a week."
The effect on the rest of the campus
is difficult to assess. A member of ZAP
House says he has seen "no concern" at
that fraternity cluster; a Toyon resident
says he feels "concern, but no fright."
One Stern Hall resident (Stern had
an early-morning bomb threat two
weeks ago) says, "I'm not scared - I'm
just edgy. But the next time the fire
alarm noes off. I'll be out the window."
