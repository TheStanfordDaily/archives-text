competition
Editor, THE DAILY:
If competition is rivalry, it
only exists in games. Life is the
biggest game of all and students at
this University are only
"practicing for the "Big Game,"
the Final game, that awaits them
after "practice" at Stanford has
concluded.
The Stanford community has
seen competition in action these
past few weeks, they have seen
what "Rivalry" might be like in
the next few years in this country.
There has been groups on
campus who have actively been
participating in "Sports of All
Sorts."
IF COMPETITION IS
RIVALRY, IT ONLY EXISTS IN
GAMES.
We have seen the main issue
confronting this school,
Institutionalized Racism,
obscured by what is=term "War
Games" (Hint-this kind of Rivalry
can be hazardous to PEOPLES
HEALTH) by racist right wing

criminals, who have tried to cover
the struggle of Black students and
Hospital workers with a barrage of
bombings, arson and
ATTEMPTED MURDER. These
are the pharisacial (students.?.)
people who preach of "Left wing
Anarchists" endangering the
American Way of Life (status
quo).
WHAT IS ATTEMPTED
MURDER TO YOU? OR IS
THAT NIGGAS HAVEN'T
QUITE REACHED THE LEVEL
OF "HUMAN" YET.
IF COMPETITION IS
RIVALRY, IT IS ONLY A
GAME.
YES, it is a game that blacks
are learning on this campus. It is
also a game that is being played
on black students on campus by
Lyman, who is, on a man, one to
none basis nothing more than a
self proclaiming liberal, a
hypocritical white man, who pays
nothing to blacks on this campus
but spit (lip) service.
IF COMPETITION IS
RIVALRY, IT IS ONLY A GAME
OF WHOSE SCORE WE will
know after the plebiscite is held,
(or do we all know the score
now?)
We shall all see and we shall
learn.

deprivation
Editor, THE DAILY:
Those of us who are disturbed
by the violence of the recent
Hospital demonstration might do
well to ponder the revelation
(Daily, Apr. 15) that only a single
non-white student is to be found
in the entire medical class of
1973. The number of deaths and
disabilities due to medical
deprivation in non-white
communities and atributable to
this circumstance may be hard to
estimate; it is certain there will be
many. Were there justice in our
world, those responsible for the
decisions that led to it would be
called to account and
appropriately punished, and the
protestors welcomed as heroes.
The underprivileged of our
nation have been listening for
endless years to glib promises and
official assurances that the system
would recognize their needs and
act in their interest. They have
waited patiently in the face of
immediate need, apparently in the
hope that the "socially
acceptable" channels would
respond.
The comfortable and
established white people, who so
self-righteously summoned the
police in the present situation and
are now actively prosecuting those

who protested, do not have to
worry about finding doctors to
treat their children and hospitals
that will offer them competent
care. Perhaps these people would
now care to take the stand in their
own defense.

(The article said that Paul
Williams is the sole minority
student in the class of '73. We
have since learned that there are
three Orientals in the class;
however, he is the only black and
there are no chicanos.—Ed.)
'vixen 9
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is a typical hypocrisy of the
male liberal establishment to gain
profit from the exploitation of
one oppressed group for the
supposed benefit of another such
group. Such is the case of the Law
School Film Society's showing of
"Vixen," a film your paper
reviews as "buxom broads (sic) of
stupefying proportions"
"pleasantly" (for whom?) "on
view." "Vixen" is essentially a
stag film.
The Law School Film Society,
according to founder Peter
Herman, was founded to raise
more funds for minority
scholarships. In this case, their
method of making money for
these oppressed people is to
further exploit another oppressed
group, women. The popular
liberal bullshit adopted by this
group is very blatantly just that.

food machines
Editor, THE DAILY:
Stanford University's labor
policy has taken another casualty
within the School of Education.
For the first two terms of the year
the Education Lounge had
provided a food service which was
operated on a concession by an
handicapped lady. The service was
highly popular with the students.
However, the University for
unapparent reasons insisted upon
maintaining food service machines
in competition with the lounge
and located in an adjacent room
as well as in the basement of the
building.
The competition from the
machines for the limited trade was
just sufficient to force the
unfortunate lady out of business.
This of course, is considered to be
sound economics but
unfortunately demonstrates a
substantial lack of social
responsibility — since the lady is
now removed from a previous
position of productive
employment and social
interchange.
The task has devolved to those
revolting machines. It is clear that
such inconsiderateness can only
serve to further sicken the hearts
of those connected with this
institution.
