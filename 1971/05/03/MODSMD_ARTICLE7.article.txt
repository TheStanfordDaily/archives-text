Stanford failed to gain ground
on UCLA in the PAC-8 baseball
race this weekend, but the Indians
took three of four games from
Washington and Washington State
at Sunken Diamond. Bob DiPietro
and Bruce Schoen beat the
Huskies, 10-1 and 4-2, on Friday.
After WSU stopped the Indians,
5-3, in Saturday's first game,
Stanford came back, 11-1, behind
Dan Shaw's strong arm in the
nightcap.
UCLA swept double headers
from Oregon and OSU to improve
its record to 7-4, however, and
gain a game in the standings on
Stanford which stood at 6-5.
After the Huskies jumped off
to a 2-0 lead, Schoen was
provided with a four run outburst
in the third inning of the first
game Friday to give him the 4-2
victory. Stanford lumped the

Washington pitchers unmercifully
for six runs in the seventh inning
of the second game to increase a
3-1 lead to 9-1, and put the game
on ice.
Saturday started on a sour note
as a momentary letdown by Bob
Kammeyer and the Stanford
defense, but the Indians awoke in
the second contest and decided
the game early.
