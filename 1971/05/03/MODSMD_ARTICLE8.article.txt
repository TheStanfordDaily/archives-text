## Golfers Beat USC 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Stanford's golfers settled some
old scores on their home course
last weekend as they stroked to
startling upsets of both Fresno
State and USC.
Coach Bud Finger's men had
been beaten twice by Fresno State
this year at the Fresno Classic and
the Western Intercollegiates. They
avenged those defeats last Friday
with a 35-19 dual match victory.
Tom Watson continued his
spectacular play, taking low score
honors against Fresno with a fine
round of 69. John Beers and Jeff
Heiser both shot one over par
72's, one shot better than their
teammate Pete Harpster. Gary
Vanier and Jim Dwulet completed
the Indian's scoring with identical
rounds of 75.
Stanford's most satisfying dual
match victory in recent years
came on Saturday afternoon when
the Indian linksters crushed
previously undefeated USC,
33-21. The 1969 Pac-8 Champions
had not lost to Stanford in dual
competition for six years and
expected to roll over the Indians
again this season. Beers came
through for Stanford by
compiling an excellent 18 hole
total of 68 to take top individual
honors in the match. Watson shot
an even par 71 to gain a tie with

his Trojan partner, Gary Sanders.
Vanier and Harpster turned in
rounds of 74 and 76 to out point
their USC, opponents while Heiser
shot a respectable 75 only to lose
to Trojan Harry Fischer who rec
orded a 72. Dwulet fired an 81 but
lost to Dave Penso's 78 for USC.
The wins over USC and Fresno
State pushed the Indian's dual
match record to an amazing 8-1
mark.
