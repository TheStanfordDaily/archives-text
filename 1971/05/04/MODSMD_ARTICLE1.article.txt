# 7,000 Arrested In Washington; Protesters To Try Again Today
## 
### ED KOHN 
WASHINGTON - Police arrested at
least 7,000 anti-war demonstrators - a
record for the city — yesterday as the
protesters attempted to shut down the
federal government by snarling
commuter traffic during the morning
rush hour.
However, they did not succeed in
stopping - or even slowing — the pace
of governmental operations, as
employees began arriving at their jobs
as early as 3:30 a.m., more than two
hours before the demonstrators began
their disruptions.
At least 100 demonstrators were
reported injured, and local hospital
emergency rooms for a time were filled
to capacity.
Disruptions to Resume
Mayday Tribe spokesmen said the
disruptions will resume this morning,

although few of those arrested
yesterday will be back on the streets.
Bail for most arrestees was set at $250,
and District of Columbia courts can
process only 160 persons an hour. Most
were charged with disorderly conduct.
However, early this morning,
Washington Police Chief Jerry V.
Wilson ordered jail clerks to accept $10
collateral for release of those who had
been charged with misdemeanors. It
was not clear how many persons would
be released immediately.
The Mayday Tribe also plans a
massive sit-in today at the Justice
Department, where nearly 350 persons
were arrested last Friday.
Sixteen hundred of those arrested
bedded down to spend the night in the
Washington Coliseum, a sports arena,
after all city jails were filled to
overflowing. Many arrested
demonstrators spent the day in a
football practice field, a jail exercise
yard, or in the middle of Dupont
Circle, a well-known gathering place for
the city's youths, under the watchful
eyes of police.
12,000 Troops
The 12,000 troops, including
Marines, Army MP's and members of
the 82nd Airbourne Division who
assisted the police department
yesterday will be on duty again this
morning.
Rennie Davis, one of the 'Chicago
Seven' and an active member of and
spokesman for the Mayday Tribe,
which originally organized yesterday's
demonstration, was arrested after an
afternoon press conference on civil
rights conspiracy charges. Another
'Chicago Seven' defendant, John
Froines, was being sought on the same
charges.
Davis was being held on $25,000
bail last night. The two charges carry a
total maximum sentence of 11 years.
Protest leaders estimated 20,000
persons participated in the
activities. The demonstrators' best
effort was at the 14th Street Bridge, a

main commuter artery, which they held
for seven minutes before being driven
away by clouds of tear gas and
highly-mobile police officers.
Pentagon Protest
Several hundred demonstrators also
threw manure at the Pentagon, where
they failed in attempts to slow traffic.
They were promptly arrested for
littering.
The demonstrators used cars, trash
cans, dumpmaster bins, boards studded
with nails, poles and their bodies during
attempts to stop traffic. They also
slashed tires on moving cars, including
one belonging to Sen. Paul Fannin
(R-Ariz.), a strong supporter of
President Nixon's war policies. They
also overturned and burned at least one
vehicle.
A heavy pall of tear gas hung over
the city during the morning, irritating
motorists and forcing businessmen to
walk around downtown holding
handkerchiefs over their noses.
Chip Marshall, a Mayday Tribe
spokesman, termed the demonstration
a "success."
"We have never claimed we could
overpower the government. The point
we were trying to accomplish was to
bring business as usual to a stop. I think
we definitely stopped business as usual.
"What we want to do is create a
crisis of conscience," Marshall added.
'Normal' Attendence
However, the Civil Service
Commission reported that job
attendance was ''normal." Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell said, "The city is open.
The traffic is flowing. The government
is functioning."
Carl Zitlo, a spokesman for the
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and
Justice, said:
"The violence was perpetrated by
the police and the government. They
tried to provoke us into retaliating with
violence. It didn't happen."
He charged that the police "beat
people" rather than arrest them in

some cases. "We were continually
gassed when we tried to regroup," he
said.
Phillip Hirschkop, a Peoples'
Coalition for Peace and Justice
attorney, charged that demonstrators
were tear gassed three times while being
held at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium
during the day. The tear gassing
apparently took place when the
demonstrators attempted to rush a
chain-link fence.
The George Washington University
(GW) campus in downtown Washington
was a center of confrontation
throughout the day. The first tear gas
was being thrown in the GW area at
6:30 a.m. and one newsman described
the situation as "a war around my
house." Groups operating out of the
GW campus strung wires across some
intersections and sat down in others.
They succeeded in holding one
intersection for seven minutes before
being routed by police and clouds of
tear gas.
Congressional Condemnation
The demonstrations were quickly
condemned by most leading members
of Congress, including Sens. Hugh
Scott, Hubert Humphrey, Ed Muskie,
George McGovern and Mike Mansfield.
President Nixon flew back to the city
last "night after a week in California,
and did not comment directly on the
protests.
Late last night, portable tents were
errected in the courtyard of the D.C.
Jail, and the prisoners themselves were
setting up portable toilets.
Other prisoners were being removed
to nearby Ft. Belvoir, Va., where they
were to be fed and housed in Army
barracks. Prisoners were also being sent
to other local federal facilities.
Most of those arrested were in the
same age group (18-24) that have
supported other "Spring Offensive"
activities in the Nation's Capitol in
which more than 1500 persons were
arrested. According to police, most of
those arrested yesterday were men.

Mayday Tribe spokesmen said the
disruptions will resume this morning,

although few of those arrested
yesterday will be back on the streets.
Bail for most arrestees was set at $250,
and District of Columbia courts can
process only 160 persons an hour. Most
were charged with disorderly conduct.
However, early this morning,
Washington Police Chief Jerry V.
Wilson ordered jail clerks to accept $10
collateral for release of those who had
been charged with misdemeanors. It
was not clear how many persons would
be released immediately.
The Mayday Tribe also plans a
massive sit-in today at the Justice
Department, where nearly 350 persons
were arrested last Friday.
Sixteen hundred of those arrested
bedded down to spend the night in the
Washington Coliseum, a sports arena,
after all city jails were filled to
overflowing. Many arrested
demonstrators spent the day in a
football practice field, a jail exercise
yard, or in the middle of Dupont
Circle, a well-known gathering place for
the city's youths, under the watchful
eyes of police.
12,000 Troops
The 12,000 troops, including
Marines, Army MP's and members of
the 82nd Airbourne Division who
assisted the police department
yesterday will be on duty again this
morning.
Rennie Davis, one of the 'Chicago
Seven' and an active member of and
spokesman for the Mayday Tribe,
which originally organized yesterday's
demonstration, was arrested after an
afternoon press conference on civil
rights conspiracy charges. Another
'Chicago Seven' defendant, John
Froines, was being sought on the same
charges.
Davis was being held on $25,000
bail last night. The two charges carry a
total maximum sentence of 11 years.
Protest leaders estimated 20,000
persons participated in the
activities. The demonstrators' best
effort was at the 14th Street Bridge, a

main commuter artery, which they held
for seven minutes before being driven
away by clouds of tear gas and
highly-mobile police officers.
Pentagon Protest
Several hundred demonstrators also
threw manure at the Pentagon, where
they failed in attempts to slow traffic.
They were promptly arrested for
littering.
The demonstrators used cars, trash
cans, dumpmaster bins, boards studded
with nails, poles and their bodies during
attempts to stop traffic. They also
slashed tires on moving cars, including
one belonging to Sen. Paul Fannin
(R-Ariz.), a strong supporter of
President Nixon's war policies. They
also overturned and burned at least one
vehicle.
A heavy pall of tear gas hung over
the city during the morning, irritating
motorists and forcing businessmen to
walk around downtown holding
handkerchiefs over their noses.
Chip Marshall, a Mayday Tribe
spokesman, termed the demonstration
a "success."
"We have never claimed we could
overpower the government. The point
we were trying to accomplish was to
bring business as usual to a stop. I think
we definitely stopped business as usual.
"What we want to do is create a
crisis of conscience," Marshall added.
'Normal' Attendence
However, the Civil Service
Commission reported that job
attendance was ''normal." Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell said, "The city is open.
The traffic is flowing. The government
is functioning."
Carl Zitlo, a spokesman for the
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and
Justice, said:
"The violence was perpetrated by
the police and the government. They
tried to provoke us into retaliating with
violence. It didn't happen."
He charged that the police "beat
people" rather than arrest them in

some cases. "We were continually
gassed when we tried to regroup," he
said.
Phillip Hirschkop, a Peoples'
Coalition for Peace and Justice
attorney, charged that demonstrators
were tear gassed three times while being
held at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium
during the day. The tear gassing
apparently took place when the
demonstrators attempted to rush a
chain-link fence.
The George Washington University
(GW) campus in downtown Washington
was a center of confrontation
throughout the day. The first tear gas
was being thrown in the GW area at
6:30 a.m. and one newsman described
the situation as "a war around my
house." Groups operating out of the
GW campus strung wires across some
intersections and sat down in others.
They succeeded in holding one
intersection for seven minutes before
being routed by police and clouds of
tear gas.
Congressional Condemnation
The demonstrations were quickly
condemned by most leading members
of Congress, including Sens. Hugh
Scott, Hubert Humphrey, Ed Muskie,
George McGovern and Mike Mansfield.
President Nixon flew back to the city
last "night after a week in California,
and did not comment directly on the
protests.
Late last night, portable tents were
errected in the courtyard of the D.C.
Jail, and the prisoners themselves were
setting up portable toilets.
Other prisoners were being removed
to nearby Ft. Belvoir, Va., where they
were to be fed and housed in Army
barracks. Prisoners were also being sent
to other local federal facilities.
Most of those arrested were in the
same age group (18-24) that have
supported other "Spring Offensive"
activities in the Nation's Capitol in
which more than 1500 persons were
arrested. According to police, most of
those arrested yesterday were men.

Sixteen hundred of those arrested
bedded down to spend the night in the
Washington Coliseum, a sports arena,
after all city jails were filled to
overflowing. Many arrested
demonstrators spent the day in a
football practice field, a jail exercise
yard, or in the middle of Dupont
Circle, a well-known gathering place for
the city's youths, under the watchful
eyes of police.
12,000 Troops
The 12,000 troops, including
Marines, Army MP's and members of
the 82nd Airbourne Division who
assisted the police department
yesterday will be on duty again this
morning.
Rennie Davis, one of the 'Chicago
Seven' and an active member of and
spokesman for the Mayday Tribe,
which originally organized yesterday's
demonstration, was arrested after an
afternoon press conference on civil
rights conspiracy charges. Another
'Chicago Seven' defendant, John
Froines, was being sought on the same
charges.
Davis was being held on $25,000
bail last night. The two charges carry a
total maximum sentence of 11 years.
Protest leaders estimated 20,000
persons participated in the
activities. The demonstrators' best
effort was at the 14th Street Bridge, a

main commuter artery, which they held
for seven minutes before being driven
away by clouds of tear gas and
highly-mobile police officers.
Pentagon Protest
Several hundred demonstrators also
threw manure at the Pentagon, where
they failed in attempts to slow traffic.
They were promptly arrested for
littering.
The demonstrators used cars, trash
cans, dumpmaster bins, boards studded
with nails, poles and their bodies during
attempts to stop traffic. They also
slashed tires on moving cars, including
one belonging to Sen. Paul Fannin
(R-Ariz.), a strong supporter of
President Nixon's war policies. They
also overturned and burned at least one
vehicle.
A heavy pall of tear gas hung over
the city during the morning, irritating
motorists and forcing businessmen to
walk around downtown holding
handkerchiefs over their noses.
Chip Marshall, a Mayday Tribe
spokesman, termed the demonstration
a "success."
"We have never claimed we could
overpower the government. The point
we were trying to accomplish was to
bring business as usual to a stop. I think
we definitely stopped business as usual.
"What we want to do is create a
crisis of conscience," Marshall added.
'Normal' Attendence
However, the Civil Service
Commission reported that job
attendance was ''normal." Atty. Gen.
John Mitchell said, "The city is open.
The traffic is flowing. The government
is functioning."
Carl Zitlo, a spokesman for the
Peoples' Coalition for Peace and
Justice, said:
"The violence was perpetrated by
the police and the government. They
tried to provoke us into retaliating with
violence. It didn't happen."
He charged that the police "beat
people" rather than arrest them in

some cases. "We were continually
gassed when we tried to regroup," he
said.
Phillip Hirschkop, a Peoples'
Coalition for Peace and Justice
attorney, charged that demonstrators
were tear gassed three times while being
held at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium
during the day. The tear gassing
apparently took place when the
demonstrators attempted to rush a
chain-link fence.
The George Washington University
(GW) campus in downtown Washington
was a center of confrontation
throughout the day. The first tear gas
was being thrown in the GW area at
6:30 a.m. and one newsman described
the situation as "a war around my
house." Groups operating out of the
GW campus strung wires across some
intersections and sat down in others.
They succeeded in holding one
intersection for seven minutes before
being routed by police and clouds of
tear gas.
Congressional Condemnation
The demonstrations were quickly
condemned by most leading members
of Congress, including Sens. Hugh
Scott, Hubert Humphrey, Ed Muskie,
George McGovern and Mike Mansfield.
President Nixon flew back to the city
last "night after a week in California,
and did not comment directly on the
protests.
Late last night, portable tents were
errected in the courtyard of the D.C.
Jail, and the prisoners themselves were
setting up portable toilets.
Other prisoners were being removed
to nearby Ft. Belvoir, Va., where they
were to be fed and housed in Army
barracks. Prisoners were also being sent
to other local federal facilities.
Most of those arrested were in the
same age group (18-24) that have
supported other "Spring Offensive"
activities in the Nation's Capitol in
which more than 1500 persons were
arrested. According to police, most of
those arrested yesterday were men.

WASHINGTON - Police arrested at
least 7,000 anti-war demonstrators - a
record for the city — yesterday as the
protesters attempted to shut down the
federal government by snarling
commuter traffic during the morning
rush hour.
However, they did not succeed in
stopping - or even slowing — the pace
of governmental operations, as
employees began arriving at their jobs
as early as 3:30 a.m., more than two
hours before the demonstrators began
their disruptions.
At least 100 demonstrators were
reported injured, and local hospital
emergency rooms for a time were filled
to capacity.
Disruptions to Resume
Mayday Tribe spokesmen said the
disruptions will resume this morning,

although few of those arrested
yesterday will be back on the streets.
Bail for most arrestees was set at $250,
and District of Columbia courts can
process only 160 persons an hour. Most
were charged with disorderly conduct.
However, early this morning,
Washington Police Chief Jerry V.
Wilson ordered jail clerks to accept $10
collateral for release of those who had
been charged with misdemeanors. It
was not clear how many persons would
be released immediately.
The Mayday Tribe also plans a
massive sit-in today at the Justice
Department, where nearly 350 persons
were arrested last Friday.
Sixteen hundred of those arrested
bedded down to spend the night in the
Washington Coliseum, a sports arena,
after all city jails were filled to
overflowing. Many arrested
demonstrators spent the day in a
football practice field, a jail exercise
yard, or in the middle of Dupont
