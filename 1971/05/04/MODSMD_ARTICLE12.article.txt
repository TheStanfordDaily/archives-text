(E VER YBOD Y KNO WS A ND
NOBODY CARES, by Mason
Smith. Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, N.Y. 213 pp. $5.95.)
Every culture has its heroes
and those who write about them:
Jack Kerouac brought the beats
across the country in "On The
Road" and Tom Wolfe took the
heads back in "The Electric
Kool-Aid Acid Test." Whatever the
current generation — post-hippie
or pre-revolution —there have
been few chroniclers worth
noting.
So, in case anyone has been
losing sleep over the whereabouts
of the modern hero (anti or
otherwise), rest easy, he's alive
and well and on the road once
again in Mason Smith's first novel,
"Everybody Knows and Nobody
Cares."
The hero is Ogden Jones
(regrettably a Stanford student -
but at least a greying one with a
wife and kids) who skips
California after the Trouble at
SRI (whereelse?). He thumb-trips
through the West, on his way to
lose America and find himself.
But 0.J., aging nature-freak-rad

is not the only hero of this book.
Each car that picks him up is a
small cosmos, surprisingly not a la
Secret Storm, whose inhabitants
give the book some of its finest
moments.
There are the kids who stole a
car and ran away from home with
only hate and fear to keep them
going. There's Joe, the teacher
from St. Louis who is running
from himself in used cars and
half-tanks of gas; and the
gap-toothed woman and her
beer-guzzling husband out for a
good time. They are all here and
now, and Smith handles their
sketches with restraint and
compassion.
Bringing all these people
together is Ogden Jones. Smith

has loaded him up with all the
paraphernalia of modern man. He
burdens him with all the excesses
of education, of lust, of
discontent, of impatience,
and miraculously, O.J.shrugs them
off and walks away, a free man.
One ought not to like a man
who says the same things to a
temporary sleeping bag
companion he says to his wife. ("I
love the fact that the sap of the
maple is sweet.") But then, he
confesses it so disarmingly ("Jones
you've said that before. To
Molly.")
One ought to feel some sophist
icated annoyance at his running
parodying dialogues with Heming
way. But he shames the sophistica
tion away. (Jesus God, Ogden. If

you don't keep loving Hemingway
you're a buzzard.") And all but
the hardest-hearted buzzards will
feel a healthy amount of affection
Smith has gracefully lightened
the load of his quester with a
liberal dose of humility. Whereas
the self-righteousness and
quasi-fanatic gleam in the eyes of
Kerouac and Wolfe's road people
distances the reader, Smith's
artful dodgings of cause and
polemic bring us closer to O.J.
One's never sure what he's
looking for or what he finds, but
its clear the thumb-tripping
teaches him something. From a
ranch in Wyoming, post-quest, he
writes, "Pray that we get through
our season in the wilderness all
right." Amen.
