# TV Cassettes Face Problems
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
Cassette video players may
revolutionize the entertainment
and instructional businesses. But
not for awhile. Video cassettes
essentially work like audio tape
cassettes except that the tape
carries picture information that
can be fed into a television
monitor giving off a
distortion-free image.
Motion picture theater owners
claim that cassette systems will
make the local theater nearly
obsolete, as patrons will be able to
rent cassettes for group viewing at
a much lower per capita cost.
In education, the growing
cassette empire is being carefully
watched as the problems of the
megacampus make alternative
instructional vehicles a necessity.
For example, one outfit, the
American Program Bureau (APB)
Television Network is pushing a
package plan to universities for a
cassette player complete with a
collection of underground films
and drama as well as lectures on
sundry topics, none of which are
appropriate for broadcasting. The
service for the APB system costs
$3000 and connects into any
normal television receiver.
But while cassettes seem to be
the thrust of new approaches to
communication, the Edsel

syndrome cautions many
potential purchasers. Although
the systems are attractive, the
variety of systems, players, and
packages reveal the lack of
uniformity in cassette
manufacutrers.
Suppose you want to buy a
cassette system. Then, depending
on whether you went to Sony,
Magnavox, RCA, Panasonic,
Ampex or some of the smaller
cassetteers, you would wind up
with a system unlike those of
another manufacturer. Some
systems use 1/4 inch tape, others
1/2 inch tape. Some use video
discs which work like a record
player with pictures. The inner
functionning of one machine
might make playing another
company's tape on it impossible.
So, according to Robert Goiter
of Meyer Library Instructional
Services, the present outlook for
cassettes "is more talk than
anything else." Goiter, who is
responsible for possible
purchasing of a system if the
library sees fit to buy, says there
"isn't any hard plan" for the
University right now in cassettes.
Until the manufacturers can come

up with a system flexible enough
for various types of cassettes,
Goiter believes it doesn't make
much sense to buy.
Also, the problem of copyright
is still up in the air. The problem
of who ought to get royalties
from the nearly unregulatable
cassettes is being talked about by
everyone from the cassette
manufacturer to the publisher of a
book whose work might appear in
a tape.
It is a sticky business at best
and this factor may delay system •
institution for some time.
Whether or not cassettes will
make first run films available for
very low cost is not yet resolvable.
But in education, Goiter believes
that cassettes have great potential
in offering more flexible
instruction for large lecture classes
where the information flow is
essentially a one way affair.
But even the prospect of "The
Econ I Show-Starring Professor
Gurley" must wait until the
cassette manufacturers can deliver
the most effective, uniform
system for instruction or
entertainment.

variety of systems, players, and
packages reveal the lack of
uniformity in cassette
manufacutrers.
Suppose you want to buy a
cassette system. Then, depending
on whether you went to Sony,
Magnavox, RCA, Panasonic,
Ampex or some of the smaller
cassetteers, you would wind up
with a system unlike those of
another manufacturer. Some
systems use 1/4 inch tape, others
1/2 inch tape. Some use video
discs which work like a record
player with pictures. The inner
functionning of one machine
might make playing another
company's tape on it impossible.
So, according to Robert Goiter
of Meyer Library Instructional
Services, the present outlook for
cassettes "is more talk than
anything else." Goiter, who is
responsible for possible
purchasing of a system if the
library sees fit to buy, says there
"isn't any hard plan" for the
University right now in cassettes.
Until the manufacturers can come

up with a system flexible enough
for various types of cassettes,
Goiter believes it doesn't make
much sense to buy.
Also, the problem of copyright
is still up in the air. The problem
of who ought to get royalties
from the nearly unregulatable
cassettes is being talked about by
everyone from the cassette
manufacturer to the publisher of a
book whose work might appear in
a tape.
It is a sticky business at best
and this factor may delay system •
institution for some time.
Whether or not cassettes will
make first run films available for
very low cost is not yet resolvable.
But in education, Goiter believes
that cassettes have great potential
in offering more flexible
instruction for large lecture classes
where the information flow is
essentially a one way affair.
But even the prospect of "The
Econ I Show-Starring Professor
Gurley" must wait until the
cassette manufacturers can deliver
the most effective, uniform
system for instruction or
entertainment.
Cassette video players may
revolutionize the entertainment
and instructional businesses. But
not for awhile. Video cassettes
essentially work like audio tape
cassettes except that the tape
carries picture information that
can be fed into a television
monitor giving off a
distortion-free image.
Motion picture theater owners
claim that cassette systems will
make the local theater nearly
obsolete, as patrons will be able to
rent cassettes for group viewing at
a much lower per capita cost.
In education, the growing
cassette empire is being carefully
watched as the problems of the
megacampus make alternative
instructional vehicles a necessity.
For example, one outfit, the
American Program Bureau (APB)
Television Network is pushing a
package plan to universities for a
cassette player complete with a
collection of underground films
and drama as well as lectures on
sundry topics, none of which are
appropriate for broadcasting. The
service for the APB system costs
$3000 and connects into any
normal television receiver.
But while cassettes seem to be
the thrust of new approaches to
communication, the Edsel

syndrome cautions many
potential purchasers. Although
the systems are attractive, the
variety of systems, players, and
packages reveal the lack of
uniformity in cassette
manufacutrers.
