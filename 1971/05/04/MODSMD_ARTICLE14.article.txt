# Diverse Films Scheduled In Area
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The number of films on campus is down
drastically this week, perhaps partially because
of the weather and the reputation of
Springtime at Stanford. Nonetheless, some of
the fare is very good and some other cinemas
in the area are providing provocative
competition.
"They Drive By Night" is an excellent
Warners melodrama, directed by action master
Raoul Walsh. George Raft and Humphrey
Bogart star as brothers involved with Ann
Sheridan and Ida Lupino. TONIGHT Clive
Miller will also be showing "Sands of Iwo
Jima." John Wayne was actually nominated
for a Best Actor Oscar for his work here but
from the number of times he says "Saddle
up!" to his troops, I began to think the Duke
still thought he was in "Red River." By 1949,
Wayne still couldn't see fit to use any blacks in
his films, but "Iwo Jima" is liberally populated
with well sorted "ethnics." It all begins at 7:30
in Mem Clive.
"Ikiru" drags on much too long, but many
moments of compassion and great humanity

remain etched in the memory. This distinct
change of pace for Akira Kurosawa will be
shown THURSDAY night in Cubberley.
Off-beat casting is the main interest of
"Sabrina," a surprisingly light romantic
comedy from Billy Wilder. Audrey Hepburn is
charming as always, but William Holden is
bland and Humphrey Bogart plays, of all
things, an establishment intellectual. At
Tresidder on FRIDAY at 7, 8 and 9.
"The 400 Blows" holds up extraordinarily
well and viewing it today casts light on the
changes in both Francois Truffaut and the
world over the past dozen years. Many
observers have accused Truffaut of becoming a
bourgeois, establishment director dealing with
simple entertainments for the mass audience.
Though the director may be somewhat less
adventurous and audacious than he used to be,
the fact remains that while the sociological
climate has become more radical and
hysterical, Truffaut has remained true to
himself.
If Truffaut is to be attacked for making
films for the public at large, should not

Godard be attacked much more severely for
his recent efforts made for an elitist
revolutionary audience? "The 400 Blows" will
be shown on SATURDAY at 7:30 and 10 in
Cubberley.
The Janus Film Festival began last week at
the Altos International Theatre and many of
the bills from now until the end of the quarter
are worth close attention. Welles' "Citizen
Kane" plays Wednesday through Saturday
with "The Magnificent Ambersons." Ophuls'
extraordinary "La Ronde" is paired with
Clement's "Forbidden Games" later in May
and the bill of Cocteau's "Beauty and the
Beast" and "Orpheus" is quite fine.
Among the programs in the Surf
Interplayers' continuing Warner Brothers series
are the current "Five Star Final" and Curtiz'
"20,000 Years in Sing Sing," Capra's
"Platinum Blonde" and Borzage's "History Is
Made at Night," Ford's "Stagecoach" and
Hawks' "Red River."
And at the Pacific Film Archive in
Berkeley, a complete retrospective of the films
of Orson Welles will begin this weekend.

the fare is very good and some other cinemas
in the area are providing provocative
competition.
"They Drive By Night" is an excellent
Warners melodrama, directed by action master
Raoul Walsh. George Raft and Humphrey
Bogart star as brothers involved with Ann
Sheridan and Ida Lupino. TONIGHT Clive
Miller will also be showing "Sands of Iwo
Jima." John Wayne was actually nominated
for a Best Actor Oscar for his work here but
from the number of times he says "Saddle
up!" to his troops, I began to think the Duke
still thought he was in "Red River." By 1949,
Wayne still couldn't see fit to use any blacks in
his films, but "Iwo Jima" is liberally populated
with well sorted "ethnics." It all begins at 7:30
in Mem Clive.
"Ikiru" drags on much too long, but many
moments of compassion and great humanity

remain etched in the memory. This distinct
change of pace for Akira Kurosawa will be
shown THURSDAY night in Cubberley.
Off-beat casting is the main interest of
"Sabrina," a surprisingly light romantic
comedy from Billy Wilder. Audrey Hepburn is
charming as always, but William Holden is
bland and Humphrey Bogart plays, of all
things, an establishment intellectual. At
Tresidder on FRIDAY at 7, 8 and 9.
"The 400 Blows" holds up extraordinarily
well and viewing it today casts light on the
changes in both Francois Truffaut and the
world over the past dozen years. Many
observers have accused Truffaut of becoming a
bourgeois, establishment director dealing with
simple entertainments for the mass audience.
Though the director may be somewhat less
adventurous and audacious than he used to be,
the fact remains that while the sociological
climate has become more radical and
hysterical, Truffaut has remained true to
himself.
If Truffaut is to be attacked for making
films for the public at large, should not

Godard be attacked much more severely for
his recent efforts made for an elitist
revolutionary audience? "The 400 Blows" will
be shown on SATURDAY at 7:30 and 10 in
Cubberley.
The Janus Film Festival began last week at
the Altos International Theatre and many of
the bills from now until the end of the quarter
are worth close attention. Welles' "Citizen
Kane" plays Wednesday through Saturday
with "The Magnificent Ambersons." Ophuls'
extraordinary "La Ronde" is paired with
Clement's "Forbidden Games" later in May
and the bill of Cocteau's "Beauty and the
Beast" and "Orpheus" is quite fine.
Among the programs in the Surf
Interplayers' continuing Warner Brothers series
are the current "Five Star Final" and Curtiz'
"20,000 Years in Sing Sing," Capra's
"Platinum Blonde" and Borzage's "History Is
Made at Night," Ford's "Stagecoach" and
Hawks' "Red River."
And at the Pacific Film Archive in
Berkeley, a complete retrospective of the films
of Orson Welles will begin this weekend.
The number of films on campus is down
drastically this week, perhaps partially because
of the weather and the reputation of
Springtime at Stanford. Nonetheless, some of
the fare is very good and some other cinemas
in the area are providing provocative
competition.
