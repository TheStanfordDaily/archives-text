# Europeans Discover 'Free' Jazz
## 
### JOHN BOWEN 
ROYAN, FRANCE-The ocean
wind was picking up outside the
Casino, driving the morning
clouds inland. The sun began to
warm the sand, bringing the
festival-goers out from the cafes
and onto the beach. Summer is
still several months away, and
Royan, like any other French
resort town, is still in hibernation.
The "Eighth International
Festival of Contemporary Art,"
however, had begun here the night
before, attracting lovers of
"serious" modern music for a
weeklong program of concerts,
films, and colloquia. What they
heard the first night, however, was
not European and not even
"serious." It was American jazz.
Even worse, it was "free jazz" -
the Celestial Communication
Orchestra or Alan Silva.
"Free jazz" really only
describes what Silva's music is
not. It is not a number of strictly
composed pieces, although it does
contain elements of composition.
It is not composed, like most rock
or jazz, of single, danceable
rythms, although it is very
rythmic, and did manage to
"move" even the French,
although certainly not out of their
seats.
Most important, it does not
limit itself to pleasant, flowing
melodies. The screech of Steve
Lacy's saxophone searching for
the limits of its range will never
replace Brahm's Lullaby or even
"Take Five" as music to eat by,
doze off by, conduct pleasant
chatter by.
Disturbs 'Serious' Ear
The "serious" musical ear
sometimes expects these things,
and so may dislike "free jazz."
"It was like a concert of
Beethoven for an audience of
deaf-men," exclaimed one critic
after Silva's first concert. He
nevertheless enjoyed the music
himself.
Silva sat down next to me in
the Casino cafe and ordered a cup
of coffee. He, too, had been
troubled by the reaction, or rather

\ of reactions, by the audience
the night before.
"The biggest danger is with
vrords. So many of these people
try to think our music. When I use
a word, it's connected to my
body. When some people use that
same word, it's connected to their
head."
Culture vs. Fun
This is especially true in
France. In the States you go to a
concert hall or a Fillmore to enjoy
the music. Some might even
smoke a little marijuana, to "get
into it."
In France you do no such
thing. Jazz and even rock are
placed under the word "culture,"
and are there to be studied. While
the American is clapping along, or
maybe even dancing to the music,
the Frenchman is taking notes for
the discussion to be held the next
day!
This works well for music
written "for the head," and there
was a lot of this presented at the
festival (all written by European
composers). But as one of Silva's
two drummers, Noel McGhee,
declared, "Man, you just can't
think fast enough for our music.
You've got to just let it kind of
flow over you."
Sun Breaks In
Silva smiled in agreement and
shifted around to face the sun,
which had just broken under the
top of the window.
"I like to think of my role as
one of 'first listener' rather than
'conductor," he said. "I'm
working toward the day when the
musicians can direct themselves."
That, however, means keeping the
same musicians together for many
months, a difficult task to
accomplish, as Silva will readily
admit.
Sea Shells
The wind had died down and
the sea had calmed. Becky Friend,
Silva's flutist and constant
companion, walked into the cafe,
her eyes bright and her hands full
of sea-shells.

"This one will be good for a
necklace, but drilling a hole will
be hard because it is so thin," she
said, showing me a small but
perfectly preserved oyster shell.
"Why don't you all come out and
enjoy the sun?"
"I'm getting it fine right here,"
answered Silva.
"Well, I'm going back out.
When do you want me back?"
"About six o'clock. We've got to
go over some parts before the
concert."
"All right. I've got to find
enough shells for a belt." Becky
walked out of the building,
looking about ten years older than
she had the night before, sitting
timidly ready to play behind
wire-rimmed glasses. This first
impression had vanished, however,
when she began, combining her
voice and the sound of her flute in
beautiful smooth tones that had
formed a gentle contrast to the
powerful, ragged sounds of
Anthony Braxton and Robin
Kenyatta's saxophones.
Striking Contrast
Someone put a Boulez
orchestral work on the Casino's
record player. Well-dressed
musicians and spectators had
begun to flow into the hall to
purchase tickets for a chamber
music concert that afternoon. A
long-haired couple in the lobby
stood out like Abbie Hoffman and
Grace Slick at the Whittier College
reunion. When I looked again I
saw that they were two of Silva's
musicians.
"We're like a side-show,"
exclaimed Anthony Braxton.
'Justlook at this program. Every
group is listed by name except
ours. We're called 'free jazz'. I'm
not Tony Braxton, I'm 'Mr. Free
Jazz'; you're 'Mr. Free Jazz'."
"Yeah, we don't have names
anymore."

Despite these complaints,
festivals like those at Royan,
Chatellerault and Antibes are
giving American free-jazzmen like
Silva and Braxton needed
exposure. The "European
>discovery" of Sun Ra was made
last year at Antibes fifteen years
after his Arkestra had started
playing in the States.
Work Scarce
Work in the States is scarce.
Being "avant guarde" means being
ahead of the vast majority of the
paying public. "I just got back
from New York and there's
nothing there," complained one
of Silva's three bassists. "Least of
all money."
But Paris as well can be a
disappointment to the "free"
musician. In the forty's and fifty's

it was the center of both
inspiration and gigs for the
avant-guardists of that time, the
"bop" and "cool" artists who
followed Charlie "Bird" Parker
and Lester Young out of the
stagnating swing era.
Those who have stayed "cool,"
or who play "pour la danse" are
still working there. But new ideas
have moved jazz forward, and the
Mother City has failed to keep
pace. Of the thirteen Parisian
clubs labeled "jazz," only one
features "free," and even there
the musicians are playing for
starvation wages.
For that reason, the presence
of the Celestial Communication
Orchestra at Royan (the first
appearance of jazz in eight years)
was a very welcome, if overdue,
event.

Silva's flutist and constant
companion, walked into the cafe,
her eyes bright and her hands full
of sea-shells.

"This one will be good for a
necklace, but drilling a hole will
be hard because it is so thin," she
said, showing me a small but
perfectly preserved oyster shell.
"Why don't you all come out and
enjoy the sun?"
"I'm getting it fine right here,"
answered Silva.
"Well, I'm going back out.
When do you want me back?"
"About six o'clock. We've got to
go over some parts before the
concert."
"All right. I've got to find
enough shells for a belt." Becky
walked out of the building,
looking about ten years older than
she had the night before, sitting
timidly ready to play behind
wire-rimmed glasses. This first
impression had vanished, however,
when she began, combining her
voice and the sound of her flute in
beautiful smooth tones that had
formed a gentle contrast to the
powerful, ragged sounds of
Anthony Braxton and Robin
Kenyatta's saxophones.
Striking Contrast
Someone put a Boulez
orchestral work on the Casino's
record player. Well-dressed
musicians and spectators had
begun to flow into the hall to
purchase tickets for a chamber
music concert that afternoon. A
long-haired couple in the lobby
stood out like Abbie Hoffman and
Grace Slick at the Whittier College
reunion. When I looked again I
saw that they were two of Silva's
musicians.
"We're like a side-show,"
exclaimed Anthony Braxton.
'Justlook at this program. Every
group is listed by name except
ours. We're called 'free jazz'. I'm
not Tony Braxton, I'm 'Mr. Free
Jazz'; you're 'Mr. Free Jazz'."
"Yeah, we don't have names
anymore."

Despite these complaints,
festivals like those at Royan,
Chatellerault and Antibes are
giving American free-jazzmen like
Silva and Braxton needed
exposure. The "European
>discovery" of Sun Ra was made
last year at Antibes fifteen years
after his Arkestra had started
playing in the States.
Work Scarce
Work in the States is scarce.
Being "avant guarde" means being
ahead of the vast majority of the
paying public. "I just got back
from New York and there's
nothing there," complained one
of Silva's three bassists. "Least of
all money."
But Paris as well can be a
disappointment to the "free"
musician. In the forty's and fifty's

it was the center of both
inspiration and gigs for the
avant-guardists of that time, the
"bop" and "cool" artists who
followed Charlie "Bird" Parker
and Lester Young out of the
stagnating swing era.
Those who have stayed "cool,"
or who play "pour la danse" are
still working there. But new ideas
have moved jazz forward, and the
Mother City has failed to keep
pace. Of the thirteen Parisian
clubs labeled "jazz," only one
features "free," and even there
the musicians are playing for
starvation wages.
For that reason, the presence
of the Celestial Communication
Orchestra at Royan (the first
appearance of jazz in eight years)
was a very welcome, if overdue,
event.
ROYAN, FRANCE-The ocean
wind was picking up outside the
Casino, driving the morning
clouds inland. The sun began to
warm the sand, bringing the
festival-goers out from the cafes
and onto the beach. Summer is
still several months away, and
Royan, like any other French
resort town, is still in hibernation.
The "Eighth International
Festival of Contemporary Art,"
however, had begun here the night
before, attracting lovers of
"serious" modern music for a
weeklong program of concerts,
films, and colloquia. What they
heard the first night, however, was
not European and not even
"serious." It was American jazz.
Even worse, it was "free jazz" -
the Celestial Communication
Orchestra or Alan Silva.
"Free jazz" really only
describes what Silva's music is
not. It is not a number of strictly
composed pieces, although it does
contain elements of composition.
It is not composed, like most rock
or jazz, of single, danceable
rythms, although it is very
rythmic, and did manage to
"move" even the French,
although certainly not out of their
seats.
Most important, it does not
limit itself to pleasant, flowing
melodies. The screech of Steve
Lacy's saxophone searching for
the limits of its range will never
replace Brahm's Lullaby or even
"Take Five" as music to eat by,
doze off by, conduct pleasant
chatter by.
Disturbs 'Serious' Ear
The "serious" musical ear
sometimes expects these things,
and so may dislike "free jazz."
"It was like a concert of
Beethoven for an audience of
deaf-men," exclaimed one critic
after Silva's first concert. He
nevertheless enjoyed the music
himself.
Silva sat down next to me in
the Casino cafe and ordered a cup
of coffee. He, too, had been
troubled by the reaction, or rather

\ of reactions, by the audience
the night before.
"The biggest danger is with
vrords. So many of these people
try to think our music. When I use
a word, it's connected to my
body. When some people use that
same word, it's connected to their
head."
Culture vs. Fun
This is especially true in
France. In the States you go to a
concert hall or a Fillmore to enjoy
the music. Some might even
smoke a little marijuana, to "get
into it."
In France you do no such
thing. Jazz and even rock are
placed under the word "culture,"
and are there to be studied. While
the American is clapping along, or
maybe even dancing to the music,
the Frenchman is taking notes for
the discussion to be held the next
day!
This works well for music
written "for the head," and there
was a lot of this presented at the
festival (all written by European
composers). But as one of Silva's
two drummers, Noel McGhee,
declared, "Man, you just can't
think fast enough for our music.
You've got to just let it kind of
flow over you."
Sun Breaks In
Silva smiled in agreement and
shifted around to face the sun,
which had just broken under the
top of the window.
"I like to think of my role as
one of 'first listener' rather than
'conductor," he said. "I'm
working toward the day when the
musicians can direct themselves."
That, however, means keeping the
same musicians together for many
months, a difficult task to
accomplish, as Silva will readily
admit.

resort town, is still in hibernation.
The "Eighth International
Festival of Contemporary Art,"
however, had begun here the night
before, attracting lovers of
"serious" modern music for a
weeklong program of concerts,
films, and colloquia. What they
heard the first night, however, was
not European and not even
"serious." It was American jazz.
Even worse, it was "free jazz" -
the Celestial Communication
Orchestra or Alan Silva.
"Free jazz" really only
describes what Silva's music is
not. It is not a number of strictly
composed pieces, although it does
contain elements of composition.
It is not composed, like most rock
or jazz, of single, danceable
rythms, although it is very
rythmic, and did manage to
"move" even the French,
although certainly not out of their
seats.
Most important, it does not
limit itself to pleasant, flowing
melodies. The screech of Steve
Lacy's saxophone searching for
the limits of its range will never
replace Brahm's Lullaby or even
"Take Five" as music to eat by,
doze off by, conduct pleasant
chatter by.
Disturbs 'Serious' Ear
The "serious" musical ear
sometimes expects these things,
and so may dislike "free jazz."
"It was like a concert of
Beethoven for an audience of
deaf-men," exclaimed one critic
after Silva's first concert. He
nevertheless enjoyed the music
himself.
Silva sat down next to me in
the Casino cafe and ordered a cup
of coffee. He, too, had been
troubled by the reaction, or rather

\ of reactions, by the audience
the night before.
"The biggest danger is with
vrords. So many of these people
try to think our music. When I use
a word, it's connected to my
body. When some people use that
same word, it's connected to their
head."
Culture vs. Fun
This is especially true in
France. In the States you go to a
concert hall or a Fillmore to enjoy
the music. Some might even
smoke a little marijuana, to "get
into it."
In France you do no such
thing. Jazz and even rock are
placed under the word "culture,"
and are there to be studied. While
the American is clapping along, or
maybe even dancing to the music,
the Frenchman is taking notes for
the discussion to be held the next
day!
This works well for music
written "for the head," and there
was a lot of this presented at the
festival (all written by European
composers). But as one of Silva's
two drummers, Noel McGhee,
declared, "Man, you just can't
think fast enough for our music.
You've got to just let it kind of
flow over you."
Sun Breaks In
Silva smiled in agreement and
shifted around to face the sun,
which had just broken under the
top of the window.
"I like to think of my role as
one of 'first listener' rather than
'conductor," he said. "I'm
working toward the day when the
musicians can direct themselves."
That, however, means keeping the
same musicians together for many
months, a difficult task to
accomplish, as Silva will readily
admit.
Sea Shells
The wind had died down and
the sea had calmed. Becky Friend,
Silva's flutist and constant
companion, walked into the cafe,
her eyes bright and her hands full
of sea-shells.

"This one will be good for a
necklace, but drilling a hole will
be hard because it is so thin," she
said, showing me a small but
perfectly preserved oyster shell.
"Why don't you all come out and
enjoy the sun?"
"I'm getting it fine right here,"
answered Silva.
"Well, I'm going back out.
When do you want me back?"
"About six o'clock. We've got to
go over some parts before the
concert."
"All right. I've got to find
enough shells for a belt." Becky
walked out of the building,
looking about ten years older than
she had the night before, sitting
timidly ready to play behind
wire-rimmed glasses. This first
impression had vanished, however,
when she began, combining her
voice and the sound of her flute in
beautiful smooth tones that had
formed a gentle contrast to the
powerful, ragged sounds of
Anthony Braxton and Robin
Kenyatta's saxophones.
Striking Contrast
Someone put a Boulez
orchestral work on the Casino's
record player. Well-dressed
musicians and spectators had
begun to flow into the hall to
purchase tickets for a chamber
music concert that afternoon. A
long-haired couple in the lobby
stood out like Abbie Hoffman and
Grace Slick at the Whittier College
reunion. When I looked again I
saw that they were two of Silva's
musicians.
"We're like a side-show,"
exclaimed Anthony Braxton.
'Justlook at this program. Every
group is listed by name except
ours. We're called 'free jazz'. I'm
not Tony Braxton, I'm 'Mr. Free
Jazz'; you're 'Mr. Free Jazz'."
"Yeah, we don't have names
anymore."

Despite these complaints,
festivals like those at Royan,
Chatellerault and Antibes are
giving American free-jazzmen like
Silva and Braxton needed
exposure. The "European
>discovery" of Sun Ra was made
last year at Antibes fifteen years
after his Arkestra had started
playing in the States.
Work Scarce
Work in the States is scarce.
Being "avant guarde" means being
ahead of the vast majority of the
paying public. "I just got back
from New York and there's
nothing there," complained one
of Silva's three bassists. "Least of
all money."
But Paris as well can be a
disappointment to the "free"
musician. In the forty's and fifty's

it was the center of both
inspiration and gigs for the
avant-guardists of that time, the
"bop" and "cool" artists who
followed Charlie "Bird" Parker
and Lester Young out of the
stagnating swing era.
Those who have stayed "cool,"
or who play "pour la danse" are
still working there. But new ideas
have moved jazz forward, and the
Mother City has failed to keep
pace. Of the thirteen Parisian
clubs labeled "jazz," only one
features "free," and even there
the musicians are playing for
starvation wages.
For that reason, the presence
of the Celestial Communication
Orchestra at Royan (the first
appearance of jazz in eight years)
was a very welcome, if overdue,
event.
ROYAN, FRANCE-The ocean
wind was picking up outside the
Casino, driving the morning
clouds inland. The sun began to
warm the sand, bringing the
festival-goers out from the cafes
and onto the beach. Summer is
still several months away, and
Royan, like any other French
resort town, is still in hibernation.
