# Demonstrations Hit SRI, Berkeley
## 
### 
SRI
An attempt to close down the
operations of the Stanford Research
Institute was foiled yesterday in the
wake of a large turnout of police and a
small turnout of demonstrators.
A crowd numbering about 50
gathered early yesterday in front of the
Ravenswood Avenue and Middlefield
Road gates of the Menlo Park research
facility. They were met by large
numbers of police, including units from
the San Mateo County Sheriff, the
Belmont, San Mateo, Daly City,
Redwood City, and South San
Francisco, as well as a helicopter from
the Sheriff's department.
Demonstrators were initially
confined to the sidewalks around the
driveways, until at 8:00 a.m. a number
of demonstrators began crossing and
recrossing the Ravenswood Avenue
drive. Traffic became snarled, and
police rerouted all traffic through the
Middlefield Entrance, which remained
open.

Demonstrators at Middlefield
continued to leaflet incoming cars until
8:30 a.m. when they jointed the picket
line on Ravenswood. Picketing
continued for another half-hour, and
the demonstrators then disbanded.
BERKELEY
A band of 15-20 unidentified
demonstrators destroyed files and
smashed office equipment at the
Berkeley draft board yesterday.
The violent protest followed a two
hour march from the University of
California campus through the streets
of downtown Berkeley.
Traffic was blocked frequently
throughout the march, by the crowd
which ranged from 600 persons at its
height to 200 persons as the end.
There was but one arrest throughout
the day, and little violence along the
march route. There were no arrests at
the draft board. Although the board is
across the street from the Berkeley
police department, police presence
throughout the day was at a minimum.
