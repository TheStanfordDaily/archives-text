# Court Affirms Desegregation Policy
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL News Analysis 
George Wallace called it "arbitrary,
asinine, and illogical," and Nixon
merely announced through his press
secretary that "administrative officials
will continue to carry out their
statutory responsibilities." Although

they weren't too impressed with the
Supreme Court's line on busing, the
two most recent decisions on the
subject will affect school children
throughout the country.
Last week the court upheld the right
of lower courts to order busing of
students in order to eliminate

segregation resulting from school board
policies. Yesterday, the court
effectively struck down a New York
law that prohibited the use of busing in
the correction of de facto school
segregation caused by residential
patterns.
Last week's ruling was the third in a
series of major decisions ordering
desegregation. The 1954 Brown
decision in effect said "do it,"and the
court's 1968 ruling said "do it now."
The latest orders seem to say "do it any
way you can."
These cases will undoubtedly have
the most effect in the South, where
local laws produced de jure segregation.
By refusing yesterday to hear an appeal
on the New York case, the court
opened the door for court action
against de facto segregation in the
North.
Many Changes Due
Specifically, opinions on four
related Southern cases supported
redrawing school-district boundaries,
pairing schools and transferring
students between them, establishing
racial quotas for schools, and
transporting children between schools.
In the process, the court upheld a
massive desegregation plan for
Charlotte, North Carolina, struck down
a North Carolina anti-busing statute,
ordered use of "all available
techniques" to desegregate in Mobile,
Alabama, and reversed a Georgia
Supreme Court decision that blocked
voluntary integration efforts.
The ruling, which Political Science
Professor Robert Horn calls "the most
important since the Brown decision" in
the area of school desegregation, is
expected to speed action in some fifty
school cases awaiting decision in
Southern Federal Courts. Horn
commented that "by and large, the
lower Federal Courts in the South have
conscientiously followed Supreme
Court decisions. The judges take their
judicial oaths seriously."
Lower court judges will, however.
