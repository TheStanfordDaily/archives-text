# Court Affirms Desegregation Policy
## 
### CHARLES MERRILL News Analysis 
George Wallace called it "arbitrary,
asinine, and illogical," and Nixon
merely announced through his press
secretary that "administrative officials
will continue to carry out their
statutory responsibilities." Although

they weren't too impressed with the
Supreme Court's line on busing, the
two most recent decisions on the
subject will affect school children
throughout the country.
Last week the court upheld the right
of lower courts to order busing of
students in order to eliminate

segregation resulting from school board
policies. Yesterday, the court
effectively struck down a New York
law that prohibited the use of busing in
the correction of de facto school
segregation caused by residential
patterns.
Last week's ruling was the third in a
series of major decisions ordering
desegregation. The 1954 Brown
decision in effect said "do it,"and the
court's 1968 ruling said "do it now."
The latest orders seem to say "do it any
way you can."
These cases will undoubtedly have
the most effect in the South, where
local laws produced de jure segregation.
By refusing yesterday to hear an appeal
on the New York case, the court
opened the door for court action
against de facto segregation in the
North.
Many Changes Due
Specifically, opinions on four
related Southern cases supported
redrawing school-district boundaries,
pairing schools and transferring
students between them, establishing
racial quotas for schools, and
transporting children between schools.
In the process, the court upheld a
massive desegregation plan for
Charlotte, North Carolina, struck down
a North Carolina anti-busing statute,
ordered use of "all available
techniques" to desegregate in Mobile,
Alabama, and reversed a Georgia
Supreme Court decision that blocked
voluntary integration efforts.
The ruling, which Political Science
Professor Robert Horn calls "the most
important since the Brown decision" in
the area of school desegregation, is
expected to speed action in some fifty
school cases awaiting decision in
Southern Federal Courts. Horn
commented that "by and large, the
lower Federal Courts in the South have
conscientiously followed Supreme
Court decisions. The judges take their
judicial oaths seriously."
Lower court judges will, however.
have some problems applying the
court's ruling; much discretion has
been left to judges in individual cases.
In ' permitting busing and zone
adjustment, the decision, written by
Chief Justice Warren Burger, stated,
"There are limits"—such measures will
be taken only "in the interim period
when remedial adjustments are being
made to eliminate the dual school
system."
'Good Temper'
Discussing the broad language of the
decision, Horn remarked, "This is not
unusual. In fact, we often say it's the
mark of good judicial temperament. A
really able judge doesn't try to settle
everything—he can't foresee all the
related situations."
A factor behind unanimity of the
decision may be that the court left the
most difficult segregation question
unresolved. The opinion emphasizes
that it applies only to cases where
school officials, in the past or present,
have created or maintained a dual
school system. It does not consider
situations where neighborhood
residence patterns have led to de facto
segregation. However, yesterday's
action hints that the court may
eventually rule in favor of action in
such cases also.
San Francisco may provide such a

test cast relatively soon. Federal
District Judge Stanley Weigel last week
ordered adoption in San Francisco of a
desegregation plan which would
involve busing. Local N.A.A.C.P.
President Charles E. Belle reacted by
saying, "It's a great day for black
people in San Francisco."
Julius Upheld
A similar case appealed from Judge
Julius Hoffman's Chicago District
Court was upheld yesterday, suggesting
that Weigel's order will also be
sustained.
Weigel's ruling which suggests that

courts can move to eliminate school
segregation produced when planning
boards and housing authorities helped
create segregated neighborhoods, may
serve as a precedent for other judges to
attack de facto segregation.
Though the new decisions are
together the most important
desegregation rulings since Brown, they
are only small steps in a continuing
sequence of court actions. Ahead lies
the challenge of dealing with spread-out
cities like Los Angeles and Washington,
where residential patterns create
seemingly incorrectible systems of de
facto segregation.

Alabama, and reversed a Georgia
Supreme Court decision that blocked
voluntary integration efforts.
The ruling, which Political Science
Professor Robert Horn calls "the most
important since the Brown decision" in
the area of school desegregation, is
expected to speed action in some fifty
school cases awaiting decision in
Southern Federal Courts. Horn
commented that "by and large, the
lower Federal Courts in the South have
conscientiously followed Supreme
Court decisions. The judges take their
judicial oaths seriously."
Lower court judges will, however.
have some problems applying the
court's ruling; much discretion has
been left to judges in individual cases.
In ' permitting busing and zone
adjustment, the decision, written by
Chief Justice Warren Burger, stated,
"There are limits"—such measures will
be taken only "in the interim period
when remedial adjustments are being
made to eliminate the dual school
system."
'Good Temper'
Discussing the broad language of the
decision, Horn remarked, "This is not
unusual. In fact, we often say it's the
mark of good judicial temperament. A
really able judge doesn't try to settle
everything—he can't foresee all the
related situations."
A factor behind unanimity of the
decision may be that the court left the
most difficult segregation question
unresolved. The opinion emphasizes
that it applies only to cases where
school officials, in the past or present,
have created or maintained a dual
school system. It does not consider
situations where neighborhood
residence patterns have led to de facto
segregation. However, yesterday's
action hints that the court may
eventually rule in favor of action in
such cases also.
San Francisco may provide such a

test cast relatively soon. Federal
District Judge Stanley Weigel last week
ordered adoption in San Francisco of a
desegregation plan which would
involve busing. Local N.A.A.C.P.
President Charles E. Belle reacted by
saying, "It's a great day for black
people in San Francisco."
Julius Upheld
A similar case appealed from Judge
Julius Hoffman's Chicago District
Court was upheld yesterday, suggesting
that Weigel's order will also be
sustained.
Weigel's ruling which suggests that

courts can move to eliminate school
segregation produced when planning
boards and housing authorities helped
create segregated neighborhoods, may
serve as a precedent for other judges to
attack de facto segregation.
Though the new decisions are
together the most important
desegregation rulings since Brown, they
are only small steps in a continuing
sequence of court actions. Ahead lies
the challenge of dealing with spread-out
cities like Los Angeles and Washington,
where residential patterns create
seemingly incorrectible systems of de
facto segregation.
George Wallace called it "arbitrary,
asinine, and illogical," and Nixon
merely announced through his press
secretary that "administrative officials
will continue to carry out their
statutory responsibilities." Although

they weren't too impressed with the
Supreme Court's line on busing, the
two most recent decisions on the
subject will affect school children
throughout the country.
Last week the court upheld the right
of lower courts to order busing of
students in order to eliminate

segregation resulting from school board
policies. Yesterday, the court
effectively struck down a New York
law that prohibited the use of busing in
the correction of de facto school
segregation caused by residential
patterns.
Last week's ruling was the third in a
series of major decisions ordering
desegregation. The 1954 Brown
decision in effect said "do it,"and the
court's 1968 ruling said "do it now."
The latest orders seem to say "do it any
way you can."
These cases will undoubtedly have
the most effect in the South, where
local laws produced de jure segregation.
By refusing yesterday to hear an appeal
on the New York case, the court
opened the door for court action
against de facto segregation in the
North.
Many Changes Due
Specifically, opinions on four
related Southern cases supported
redrawing school-district boundaries,
pairing schools and transferring
students between them, establishing
racial quotas for schools, and
transporting children between schools.
In the process, the court upheld a
massive desegregation plan for
Charlotte, North Carolina, struck down
a North Carolina anti-busing statute,
ordered use of "all available
techniques" to desegregate in Mobile,
Alabama, and reversed a Georgia
Supreme Court decision that blocked
voluntary integration efforts.
