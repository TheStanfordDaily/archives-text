# Court Ruling Ends Ban On Executions
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The Supreme Court removed a legal roadblock to mass
executions in the United States yesterday with a 6-3 ruling upholding the broad
authority of juries to choose between life and death sentences.
Wholesale executions are not expected immediately, however, since the
ultimate challenge to death penalty, as a "cruel and unusual punishment" barred
by the U.S. Constitution, still remains open.
The court said Monday that the Constitution does not require legislatures to
set standards to guide juries in capital cases. The three dissenters protested that
this was endorsing "the states' power to kill" instead of the rule of law.
At the same time, the court rejected a plea that it order trials split into two
phases. The idea was to allow a defendant who did not take the stand to have a
chance, if convicted, of personally trying to dissuade the jury against imposing the
death penalty.
The Wait Is Over
The ruling ended two and a half years of suspenseful consideration by the
court. While it deliberated, hearing the issues argued three times, the death house
population rose to where there are 641 men and 7 women on condemned row in
33 states.
There has not been an execution in the United States since June 2, 1967.
Some 115 appeals from condemned prisoners are pending in the court, many
of them raising the "cruel and unusual punishment" argument.
The NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund summoned a national
conference in New York City May 15-16 of lawyers from the 38 states that
employ the death penalty. A fund lawyer, Jeffry Mintz,said he expects the court
to hear the Eighth Amendment argument within a year.
Other Actions
In other actions the court: Upheld the government's power to prosecute people
who send pornography through the mails and to seize obscene material brought
into the country. -Declined again to hear an appeal involving school segregation in
the North. -Agreed to pass on the question of whether newsmen have a
