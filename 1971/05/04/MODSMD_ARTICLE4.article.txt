# Blacks, Chicanos, Women At GSB Seek Identity
## 
### JOANN LUBLIN 
(Second of a two-part Series)
The Graduate School of Business classifies 42 students
(about 8 percent of the total enrollment) as members of
racial and ethnic minorities; many of these have some type
of financial aid.
But dollars and student body counts do not tell the
whole story. Figures say nothing about being hassled by
black brothers for "copping out" to the white man's
business establishment. The figures say nothing about the
lack of sensitivity to the peculiar problems of Chicano
business students. And the numerical breakdowns of the
minority student population at the GSB exclude the
women students altogether.
Let us look more closely at each of these three groups.
Black Students
Like MBA students in general, black students at the "B"
School consider the program to be academically sound.
"Administrators probably believe the 'niggers' here are
happy," Bob Grayson, a black said sarcastically. He is
sarcastic because academics are only part of the two years
GSB experience.
"There are some very, very nice and aware faculty and
students here," Ron Walker, a graduating GSB black
student, said, "but they are in a small minority." The GSB
full-time faculty think, talk and act white — and as a result,
many professors ignore the problems facing minority
students and minority businessmen, according to several
students and faculty members. Some professors
automatically categorized the first H black students as less
academically capable than white students - since this was
their first classroom experience with more than one or two
black students.
"Most of the faculty avoid minority issues because
they're not very familiar with them or don't want to be

seen as racists," Bradford said. This problem has been
solved in some classes by permitting the black students to
lead the discussion on business and racism.
Petty Problems
The black student MBA has also had to face the
jealousies and occasional racist attitudes of white students.
For instance, a white student stood idly in the GSB
placement office last week and mused, "I wish I were
black. Then I would get a lot more job offers." A white
friend retorted, "Yeah, but what about advancement?"
The "free ride" or financial aid for blacks has been
another source of white students' resentment. Grayson
recalled an white student with all A's in his classes who
complained he received no "B" School money this year
because of the minority students' needs.
The snubs and the stereotyping helped unify the first
group of "B" School black students last year. Under
Walker's direction, they formed the Minority Coalition
which met with top "B" School administrators for the first
time in January 1970.
The Coalition has pushed for what it feels would be a
more minority-relevant curriculum, an improvement in the
white faculty and student attitudes, more financial aid,
increased black admissions, minority representation on the
fiiculty and this year's recruitment efforts by second-year

black students. Coalition representatives — which included
Chicano students until a split last February — now meet
about once a month with Associate Dean R.E. Jaedicke,
Assistant Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs Gary
Williams, MBA Program Director James C. Van Home and
Associate Dean Samuel A. Pond.
Chicano Students
The main problem for Chicano students in the Business
School in their opinion is that not enough people recognize
their problems as distinct from blacks'. Problems such as
Chicano admissions, Chicano administrators and/or faculty
and more Chicano community-related courses are the focus
of their concern.
The Chicano "B" students came to Stanford on the
shirttails of the black minority enrollment program — only
to face an administration that defines minority as "black."
"When we (faculty and administrators) mention minorities,
we think black," says Prof. Bradford. "Unfortunately, we
do respond to pressures." That is to be expected, Grayson
said, because "if you're the first one in line to complain,
then you are the first one to get attention."
Yet since an estimated eight million Chicanos live in the
Southwest. Chicano "B" students think the GSB should
give more serious attention to their needs. This may happen
in coming years. The ad hoc committee reviewing
admissions policy is also going to recommend that
recruiting take place primarily on the West Coast — partly
to find more Chicano and Indian applicants and partly
because "the outstanding minority students on the East
Coast are grabbed up" by business schools like Harvard,
Robert MeCaskill, a student member of the committee,
said.
Frictions in Coalition
The committee might have never made this
recommendation, though, if one of the Chicano students

had not sat in on meetings. This attempt to promote the
visibility of Chicano students is characteristic of most
Chicano efforts in the "B" School so far.
At first, they hoped the Minority Coalition would lobby
for their interests with administrators. But frictions
occurred, especially between the Chicanos and second-year
black students. A number of second-year black students
were from the East and seemed particularly naive about
Chicanos. One black student told Chicano student Andy
Resendez he thought there were "about 50,000 Chicanos in
the U.S." In addition, the seond-year black students on the
Coalition "all had connections with administrators and
topped the committees," Ismael Verduzco, a first-year
Chicano student, said.
The Coalition was supposedly run by a committee of 1
black, 1 Chicano and Jack Watts, the 5/16 Cherokee
Indian. In actuality — say the Chicanos — the Coalition
secretary "controlled the information" and reported it only
to his black counterparts. For instance, Chicanos were
never told about one key meeting to discuss hiring more
minority administrators, says Verduzco. "We tried to find
ways to work together — but they thought they had
cultural conflicts," recalls Walker, who is black.
In late February, the Chicano "B" students pulled out
of the Coalition and began meeting separately with
Jaedicke and other administrators.
At the two meetings so far. the Chicanos have argued for
the appointment of a Chicano administrator. Such a person
could recruit more Chicanos than countless visits by black
Tom Edmonds to San .lose State the group said.
Administrators replied that it would be unwise to create a
position strictly for Chicanos. The Chicanos also argued
that first-year minority students should have been allowed
to do recruiting this year.
Despite the restrictions placed on recruiting in 1970-71,
