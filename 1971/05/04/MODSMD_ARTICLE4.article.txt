# Blacks, Chicanos, Women At GSB Seek Identity
## 
### JOANN LUBLIN 
(Second of a two-part Series)
The Graduate School of Business classifies 42 students
(about 8 percent of the total enrollment) as members of
racial and ethnic minorities; many of these have some type
of financial aid.
But dollars and student body counts do not tell the
whole story. Figures say nothing about being hassled by
black brothers for "copping out" to the white man's
business establishment. The figures say nothing about the
lack of sensitivity to the peculiar problems of Chicano
business students. And the numerical breakdowns of the
minority student population at the GSB exclude the
women students altogether.
Let us look more closely at each of these three groups.
Black Students
Like MBA students in general, black students at the "B"
School consider the program to be academically sound.
"Administrators probably believe the 'niggers' here are
happy," Bob Grayson, a black said sarcastically. He is
sarcastic because academics are only part of the two years
GSB experience.
"There are some very, very nice and aware faculty and
students here," Ron Walker, a graduating GSB black
student, said, "but they are in a small minority." The GSB
full-time faculty think, talk and act white — and as a result,
many professors ignore the problems facing minority
students and minority businessmen, according to several
students and faculty members. Some professors
automatically categorized the first H black students as less
academically capable than white students - since this was
their first classroom experience with more than one or two
black students.
"Most of the faculty avoid minority issues because
they're not very familiar with them or don't want to be

seen as racists," Bradford said. This problem has been
solved in some classes by permitting the black students to
lead the discussion on business and racism.
Petty Problems
The black student MBA has also had to face the
jealousies and occasional racist attitudes of white students.
For instance, a white student stood idly in the GSB
placement office last week and mused, "I wish I were
black. Then I would get a lot more job offers." A white
friend retorted, "Yeah, but what about advancement?"
The "free ride" or financial aid for blacks has been
another source of white students' resentment. Grayson
recalled an white student with all A's in his classes who
complained he received no "B" School money this year
because of the minority students' needs.
The snubs and the stereotyping helped unify the first
group of "B" School black students last year. Under
Walker's direction, they formed the Minority Coalition
which met with top "B" School administrators for the first
time in January 1970.
The Coalition has pushed for what it feels would be a
more minority-relevant curriculum, an improvement in the
white faculty and student attitudes, more financial aid,
increased black admissions, minority representation on the
fiiculty and this year's recruitment efforts by second-year

black students. Coalition representatives — which included
Chicano students until a split last February — now meet
about once a month with Associate Dean R.E. Jaedicke,
Assistant Dean for Admissions and Student Affairs Gary
Williams, MBA Program Director James C. Van Home and
Associate Dean Samuel A. Pond.
Chicano Students
The main problem for Chicano students in the Business
School in their opinion is that not enough people recognize
their problems as distinct from blacks'. Problems such as
Chicano admissions, Chicano administrators and/or faculty
and more Chicano community-related courses are the focus
of their concern.
The Chicano "B" students came to Stanford on the
shirttails of the black minority enrollment program — only
to face an administration that defines minority as "black."
"When we (faculty and administrators) mention minorities,
we think black," says Prof. Bradford. "Unfortunately, we
do respond to pressures." That is to be expected, Grayson
said, because "if you're the first one in line to complain,
then you are the first one to get attention."
Yet since an estimated eight million Chicanos live in the
Southwest. Chicano "B" students think the GSB should
give more serious attention to their needs. This may happen
in coming years. The ad hoc committee reviewing
admissions policy is also going to recommend that
recruiting take place primarily on the West Coast — partly
to find more Chicano and Indian applicants and partly
because "the outstanding minority students on the East
Coast are grabbed up" by business schools like Harvard,
Robert MeCaskill, a student member of the committee,
said.
Frictions in Coalition
The committee might have never made this
recommendation, though, if one of the Chicano students

had not sat in on meetings. This attempt to promote the
visibility of Chicano students is characteristic of most
Chicano efforts in the "B" School so far.
At first, they hoped the Minority Coalition would lobby
for their interests with administrators. But frictions
occurred, especially between the Chicanos and second-year
black students. A number of second-year black students
were from the East and seemed particularly naive about
Chicanos. One black student told Chicano student Andy
Resendez he thought there were "about 50,000 Chicanos in
the U.S." In addition, the seond-year black students on the
Coalition "all had connections with administrators and
topped the committees," Ismael Verduzco, a first-year
Chicano student, said.
The Coalition was supposedly run by a committee of 1
black, 1 Chicano and Jack Watts, the 5/16 Cherokee
Indian. In actuality — say the Chicanos — the Coalition
secretary "controlled the information" and reported it only
to his black counterparts. For instance, Chicanos were
never told about one key meeting to discuss hiring more
minority administrators, says Verduzco. "We tried to find
ways to work together — but they thought they had
cultural conflicts," recalls Walker, who is black.
In late February, the Chicano "B" students pulled out
of the Coalition and began meeting separately with
Jaedicke and other administrators.
At the two meetings so far. the Chicanos have argued for
the appointment of a Chicano administrator. Such a person
could recruit more Chicanos than countless visits by black
Tom Edmonds to San .lose State the group said.
Administrators replied that it would be unwise to create a
position strictly for Chicanos. The Chicanos also argued
that first-year minority students should have been allowed
to do recruiting this year.
Despite the restrictions placed on recruiting in 1970-71,
the students were assured by Dean Miller at their April 16
meeting that at least eight Chicanos will be admitted to the
next first-year class — the same number as those in this
year's class.
The Chicanos "are now where we were at ten years
ago," Walker commented, to which Edmonds added: "The
Chicano students are going through a self-identification
process" which is "no longer a question for blacks."
Women Students
A few years ago, Barbara West came to the School of
Business to talk about applying to Nat Allyn, then assistant
dean for admissions. Allyn asked her what her father did
for a living. He works for Eastman Kodak, West told him.
Allyn replied, "I think you'd be happier elsewhere
because our experience is that there's no place for women
in business — except if you were to go into the
family-owned business." Finding his remarks "a bit
distressing," West did not apply until 1970.
The incident took place in 1964. Things have changed
somewhat since that time for women in Stanford's Business
School, but not much — until this year.
Because women are not viewed as a minority group,
they get no special consideration in admission and/or
financial aid at the "B" School. "I guess we don't regard
them as a minority," MBA Program Director Van Home
admitted. Yet the women students run into minority group
hassles — from simple things like being mistaken for a
professor's secretary to snide faculty comments about
"girls" or wife-swapping jokes to being constantly queried
by condescending male students as to why they came to
"B" School to frequent cases of both overt and subtle
discrimination by job recruiters.
There is little administration-level concern about women
in the Business School because of no outside pressure —
like the pressure from civil rights groups a few years ago,
argues Susie Phillips, a first-year student. But it also takes
"inside" pressure — witness the Minority Coalition. "There
are too few women in the GSB to organize," said Anne

Thornton, another first-year student. "Women are still a
real rarity."
Identity, The Issue
It is not so much a numbers problem; 72 women have
graduated from Stanford's Business School since 1930 and
there are usually at least 3 or 4 in every class (a total of 11
are currently enrolled in the MBA program). According to
some, it is a problem of group identity and group pressure.
Women "B" students are still asking themselves, "Do I
exert myself as a women or do I blend in with what's
there? ," Edmonds noted. Until this year, Williams pointed
out, women at the "B" School had "never worked together
as a unit at all."
But this year, four of the five first-year women were
placed in the same section for all classes, allowing thern to
share ideas and feelings more. "Now with four of us in one
class," West said, "instead of just wondering if something
was insulting, we leaned on one another for moral
support."
That kind of moral support was apparent in an incident
last October involving a West Coast representative from one
of the country's largest consulting firms who spoke at a
"B" School career planning seminar. One woman student
asked for his firm's policy on hiring women. The
representative, who heads the firm's San Francisco office,
said, "We can't use women in our office. It just wouldn't
work." The student asked him if he knew such practices are
illegal. "He said he didn't think he could be touched," she
recalled.
After the seminar, the woman student — accompanied
by the four other first-year women — filed a complaint on
the firm with Peterson, the GSB assistant dean for
placement. He spoke with firm officials and later got a
formal statement from them that they did not discriminate
on the basis of sex. The women also got Peterson to set up
specific procedures for handling future discrimination
complaints within the "B" School.
Changes Outside
The feminist movement in the "outside" world may
partly explain the increasing minority group consciousness
of women students — and partly explain the expected
future rise in applications. "Admission in part will be a
function of whether women are successful in business,"
Jaedicke said, pointing out that women will not attend the
Business School unless they "see opportunities open at the
end."
