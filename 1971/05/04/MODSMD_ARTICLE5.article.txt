## May Day Protests Crucial 
### 
Tomorrow is May Day in San Francisco. The demonstrations and
protests planned for the Days of May, in Washington and in our local
communities, are perhaps the most crucial point to date in the seven
year history of the peace movement. After six years of protest, a
dissenting minority has finally succeeded in convincing the majority.
The critical question of the 70's is whether or not this majority
opinion will have any meaning in American politics.
It's clear that the impetus for peace is not coming from the
government. Nixon and Laird have made it clear that there is no plan
to end the a plan to limit the number of American troops
involved in the fighting.
The People's Peace Treaty arose out of the understanding that the
American people are going to have to make the peace, since our
government clearly does not intend to do it on its own. The power to
enforce the Peace Treaty must come from all of us who believe that
the American and Vietnamese people are not enemies. The anti-war
movement, to have any effect, must develop a clear program for
implementation of the Treaty.
Continual Dissent
We have to move from a strategy of piecemeal protest to one of
continual expressions of dissent and widespread resistance. Only
sustained pressure at every level, only the constant threat of
disrupting the social fabric of America will speak to those who have
the power to end the war. Understanding power in America is to
understand which forces must be pressured.
The targets for tomorrow's all day demonstrations in San Francisco
are the most powerful institutions in America—the oil companies and
the financial firms. The oil and financial interests sit at the heart of
monopoly capitalism. They determine foreign and domestic policy.
They are the war corporations which are funding and fueling the war;
it is they who are profiting from it. It is their present and future
interests which are being protected by the mass murder of Asians—not
yours or mine.
If these powerful institutions cannot be forced to give up their
economic stakes in Asia, how can we expect these same institutions
which also control the fate of ecology, housing, medical care, public
transportation, mass media, recreation, etc. ever to act in the interests
of the American people- except at their convenience?
Targets & Tactics
The targets and tactics for tomorrows activities are varied. The
main focus of disruption will be Standard Oil, the major supplier of
fuel to the military. Standard is also one of the 15 American firms
presently bidding for valuable oil rights off the coast of Vietnam from

the Thieu/Ky regime.
During the morning and afternoon, mid-peninsula people are also
going to picket, pass out the peace treaty, and leaflet at other targets.
First on the list is the International building (California and Kearny)
which houses our own War Lords, the Stanford Trustees, and
Natomas, which has a big hand in a rich oil find off the coast of
Indonesia.
Right across the street is another oil firm with interests in
Asia—Tenneco. And around the corner is the self-proclaimed symbol
of America—The Bank of Amerika.
The war ip Indochina and the repression of dissent at home have
laid bare the fangs of power in America. The American government
and the anti-war movement are coming to a showdown. Veterans are
throwing back their metals and spitting on the "democracy" that they
risked their lives to defend. In Washington, on Sunday, 50,000
protestors were told by the U.S. Justice Department that, "Further
assemblys and demonstrations on Vietnam are illegal." Over 7,000
demonstrators are being detained in what some Senators have called a
"concentration camp." Stanford's Big Brother Defenseman Packard
said last fall: "Things are going to have to come to a head in this
country, and it might as well be now."
Essential Question
What's coming to a head is the essential question of who rules
America. Despite the vast majority opinion against the war and the
committment of hundreds of thousands to risk their safety to try to
end it, Nixon has made it clear that he will not be influenced.
What can we do? Give up? Are we to go home now because
America's stake in Vietnam has taken precedence over America's stake
in democratic and egalitarian values? What we're learning from
Vietnam and the ghettos is that democracy in America has only been
an illusion in the minds of the voters. Democracy only existed when it
served the interests of those in power.
If we give up and go home now we are accepting the reality that we
are beginning to understand—that America is an authoritarian and
imperialist country, dominated by the values of profit and
competition, controlled by a small power elite, existing in basic
contradiction to human values and world peace.
If we give up now, we are accepting the fact that we will never be
able to control the institutions that determine our lives. If Americans
agree that the war must stop, and we cannot enforce that will, then
what can we ever hope to do?
Start tomorrow and make everyday Mayday.
