## The 						New Opium War: Part II

An article by Kansas City
newspaperwoman Gloria Emerson
inserted into the Congressional
Record by Senator Stuart
Symington on March 10 said: "In
a brigade headquarters at Long
Binh, there were reports that
heroin use in the unit had risen to
20 percent. . . 'You can salute an
officer with your right hand and
take a "hit" (of heroin) in your
left,' an enlisted man from New
York told me . ..
Along the 15-mile Bien Hoa
highway running north to Saigon
from Long Binh, heroin can be
purchased at any of a dozen
conspicuous places within a few
minutes, and was by this reporter,
for three dollars a vial."
Adding glamour to the
labyrinthine intrigue of Vietnam's
opium trade throughout the late
1950's and early '60's was the
famous Madame Nhu, the Dragon
Lady of Saigon. Madame Nhu was
in a position to be very likely
coordinator for the entire
domestic opium traffic in
Vietnam; yet so great is the power
she still wields from her palatial
exile in Paris that she has
intimidated one American

publisher and kept him from
publishing the story.
In his book, Mr. Pop, Don
Schanche, former editor of
Horizon and managing editor of
the Saturday Evening Post,
recounts the following
interchange on the Plain of Jars
during August 1960 between
Edgar "Pop" Buell the Indiana
farmer who left his home to work
with the Meo tribesf.eople—and a
local restauranteur:
.. . Buell drove with Albert
[Foure] o Phong Savan and
watched trom the side of the
airstrip as a modern twin-e'ngined
plane took on a huge load of
opium. Benei tli the wing, talking
heatedly with 11 e plane's Corsican
pilot, was a slender woman
dressed in long white silk pants
and ao d'ai, the side-slit,
high-necked gown of Vietnam.
Her body was exquisitely formed,
and her darkly beautiful face wore

frank browning, banning garrett

a clear expression of authority.
Even Buell could see that she was
Vietnamese, not Lao.
"Zat," said Foure, "is grande
madame of opium fron: Saigon."
Edgar never learned her name, but
he recognized the unforgettable
face and figure when the picture
of an important South
Vietnamese politician appeared
months later in an American news
magazine.
Though Schanche's publisher,
David McKay Co., refused to
publish her name for fear of
reprisals, the unforgettable face
was that of Madame Nhu.
But Siagon's opium trade is not
new. Its history stretches back to
1949, when the French appointed
former Vietnamese Emperor Bao
Dai as chief of state. Bao Dai
brought with him as chief of
police Bay Vien, the undisputed
leader of Saigon's criminal
underground, which controlled
not only the gambling and
narcotics trade in Saigon but also
the important Chinese suburb of
Cholon. Bao Dai and Bay Vien
held power until they were
displaced after the 1954 Geneva
Accords by Ngo Din Nhu, Diem's
brother, Nhu had gained
prominence in Vietnam as an
organizer of a Catholic trade
union movement modeled after
the French Force Ouvriere, which
the CIA had helped supply in the
1940s to break France's
communist dockworkers' union,
the CGT.
At first Nhu feigned support
for Bay Vien and Bao Dai, but by
the end of 1955 he had taken
control of the Saigon secret police
and—thereby—the city's opium
and heroin trade as well. Just as
the Nhus were consolidating their
own power, a little-known figure
entered the Diem military
apparatus-a man who through
the years would carefully extend
his control over the air force and
end up eventually heir not only to
the South Vietnamese government

but to the opium and heroin trade
as well. That man was Nguyen
Cao Ky, who had just returned
from Algeria to take charge of the
South Vietnamese air transport's
C-47 cargo planes.
Icy Intervention
At what particular point in
time Ky became involved with the
Nhus in the opium trade is not
known, but by the end of the '50s
he was cutting quite a figure in
Saigon's elite circles. In an
interview with Ramparts, retired
Marine Corps Colonel (and author
of the book The Betrayal) William
Corson described Ky's life in the
late 1950s in the following
fashion:
"Ky of course was a colonel in
the Air Force back then and he
used to have these glittering
cocktail parties at the top of the
Caravelle I Hotel] in Saigon. He
laid out a fantastic spread-which
was all very interesting because
the amount of money he made as
a soldier was maybe $25 to $30 a
month and he didn't have any
other outside income."
The first real light shed on the
possible sources of Ky's
extracurricular income came only
in the spring of 1968, when
Senator Ernest Guening revealed
that four years earlier Ky had
been in the employ of the ClA's
"Operation Haylift," a program
which flew South Vietnamese
agents "into North Vietnam for
the purpose of sabotage, such as
blowing up railroads, bridges,
etc." More important, Ky was
fired, Gruening's sources claimed,
for having been caught smuggling
opium from Laos back into
Saigon. Significantly, Ky and his
flight crews were replaced by
Nationalist Chinese Air Force
pilots.
Neither the CIA, the Pentagon,
nor the State Department ever
denied Ky worked on Operation
Haylift. Nor did they deny that he
had smuggled opium back into
Saigon. However, a U.S. embassy
spokesman categorically denied
Ky was ever fired from "any
position by an element of the U.S.
Government for opium smuggling
or for any other reason." When
Ky came to power in February

1965, most observers supposed he
had relinquished participation in
the opium traffic (although it was
"common knowledge" that
Madame Ky had replaced Madame
Nhu as Saigon's Dragon Lady and
dealt in opium directly with
Prince Boun Oum in Southern
Laos).
However, a high Saigon
military official to whom Ky at
one time offered a place in the
opium traffic says Ky continued
to carry loads ranging from 2000
to 3000 kilos of opium from
Pleiku to Saigon in the spring of
1965 after he had assumed power
and after Operation Haylift had
been discontinued. Those runs
included regular pickups near Dak
To, Kon Turn and Pleiku. Since
then there has been no indication
that Ky has in any way altered the
transport. William Corson, who
returned to Vietnam in 1965,

trade was controlled by the
Corsican Mafia (which itself has
long been related to such
American crime lords as Lucky
Luciano, who funneled a certain
amount of dope into the black
ghettoes). But high officials in the
narcotics control division of the
Canadian government, and in
Interpol, the International Police
Agency, confirm that since World
War ll—and paralleling the U.S.
expansion in the Pacific-there
has been a major redirection in
the sources and routing of the
worldwide opium traffic.
According to the United
Nations Commission on Drugs and
Narcotics, since at least 1966, 80
percent of the world's 1200 tons
of illicit opium has come from
Southeast Asia—directly
contradicting most official U.S.
claims that the primary sources
are Middle Kastern. In 1966
Interpol's former Secretary
General Jean Nepote told
investigators from Arthur D.
Little Research Institute (then
under contract to the U.S.
Government Crime Commission)
t!iat the Fertile Triangle was a
principal production center of
opium.

According to the U.N. Commision on
Drugs and Narcotics...Bo% percent
of the world's...opium comes from
S.E. Asia

observed that Ky's involvement in
the trade had become so
routinized that it had lost almost
all its adventure and intrigue.
Kingpin
With gross returns from the
Indochinese traffic running
anywhere from $250 to $500
million per year, opium is one of
the kingpins of Southeast Asian
commerce. Indochina has not
always had such an enviable
position. Historically most of the
world's supply of opium and
heroin came through
well-established routes from
Turkey, Iran and China.
Then it was refined in chemical
kitchens and warehouse factories
in Marseille. The Mediterranean

And last year an Iranian
government official told a United
Nations seminar on narcotics
control that 83 percent of the
world's illegal supply originated in
the Fertile Triangle—the area
where opium is controlled by the
U.S.-supplied troops of Laos and
Nationalist China.
It is odd that the U.S.
government, with the most
massive intelligence apparatus in
history, could miss this
innovation. But though it may
seem to be an amazing oversight,
what has happened is that Richard
Nixon and the makers of
America's Asian policy have
completely blanked Indochina out
of the world narcotics trade.
