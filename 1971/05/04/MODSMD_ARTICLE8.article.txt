# Council Seeks Student Input
## 
### CYNTHIA WASNEY 
"Opening University decision-making processes to include student
input" is one of the major goals of the new ASSU Council of
Presidents.
However, all four — Doug McHenry, Diane Fields, Ann Kimball,
and Larry Diamond — stress that they can't "do it all" and that if the
University is to be a community, there must be action as a
community.
The Council views itself as an agency of "pseudo-legitimate"
pressure on the Administration and as a reliable source of information
for students. Commenting on the effectiveness of pressuring the
Administration, Kimball stated, "We can't make the University do
anything, but we can constitute a nuisance." "It's not enough to react
to situations and conflicts," added Fields. "We want to act before
conflicts arise."
One example of the "pseudo-legitimate pressure" is the Council's
support of the Med Center demands. "The demands are impotent and
I realize that all of them will never happen. But I support them
because I agree with the sentiment behind them," McHenry stated.
Regarding their informative capacity, Kimball lists war
involvement, land investment, budget priorities and admission policies
as areas the council will investigate. The goal is to provide a basis for
"informed negotiation."
"It's the duty of the Council of Presidents to let students know
when the Administration is working in the students' interest and when
it is not. Right now, they're (the Administration) not letting us
know," McHenry commented.
He cites as an example, the proposal of giving peace officer status
to campus police and stresses that no student input was asked for.
"This is something which affects us directly: students should have a
say in the decision."

Another example, on a larger scale, is the Willow Expressway issue.
"The trustees must meet with the people who have complaints,"
McHenry contends. "By the time the Trustees hear the complaints,
they have been distilled beyond recognition."
Referenda passed at the last ASSU election, concerning prohibition
of Stanford land use for U.S. military recruiting and war-related
corporations are seen by the Council as further instances of university
ignorance of student sentiment.
"Students have endorsed these referenda. This gives a mandate to
act," according to Diamond. "This includes strong support from the
ASSU office and active lobbying."
All four emphasise the need for widespread mobilization and the
inability of the Council to be truly effective if their commitment is
not accompanied by student effort.
Decisions to call police on campus is another major concern of the
Council and illustrates an area in which "we are actively trying to
form alternative decision-making machinery," Kimball said. "Lyman
has final responsibility in calling in the police. He is advised by a small
group of faculty members, who always represent only one kind of
input," Diamond stated.
Domino Theory
McHenry believes that calling in the police is "the result of the
Administration's belief in the domino theory. In other words, the
belief that if the Administration gives in here, they'll be forced to give
in everywhere. Thus, their only recourse is institutionalized violence.
Administratively, that's the decision to make, but it's an evasion," he
contends.
"It is clear to all of us that 'preservation of the University' is the
justification for calling police. But reason, not fear must be the basis
for decisions. Unless there is more rational input, there are going to be
more fearful decisions," argues Diamond. According to McHenry,
"The University president must further disperse his authority if
decisions are to have any credibility. If there is greater credibility,
there will be less conflict."
Committee Reforms
Concerning interaction with the Senate, Kimball emphasizes the
importance of reforming committee structure, noting that the
"present Nominations Committee is bogged down because of
numerous overlapping committees. We also hope to consolidate
faculty and student committees where appropriate."
McHenry who has a seat on the Nominations Committee, said he
will attempt to fill committee vacancies with "people that
complement our opinions, although not necessarily people who
always agree with us."
Complementary opinions are those "that do not represent a
fundamental roadblock to policies endorsed by the student body (as
evidenced by our election). "Since all student views can never be
represented, it always gets down to politics," he argues. "Therefore, 1
am not in favor of random selection."
"The Student Senate is becoming more and more discredited in the
eyes of the student body. They suspect hanky-panky. The important
thing in that case is to campaign against individuals, not to destroy the
Senate itself. This is an attempt on the part of conservatives to do
what radicals are so often accused of: trying to destroy a structure
without leaving anything in its place," McHenry continued.
At the present time, the $0 program fee still stands. The council
urges support of the $1 program fee initiative.

and Larry Diamond — stress that they can't "do it all" and that if the
University is to be a community, there must be action as a
community.
The Council views itself as an agency of "pseudo-legitimate"
pressure on the Administration and as a reliable source of information
for students. Commenting on the effectiveness of pressuring the
Administration, Kimball stated, "We can't make the University do
anything, but we can constitute a nuisance." "It's not enough to react
to situations and conflicts," added Fields. "We want to act before
conflicts arise."
One example of the "pseudo-legitimate pressure" is the Council's
support of the Med Center demands. "The demands are impotent and
I realize that all of them will never happen. But I support them
because I agree with the sentiment behind them," McHenry stated.
Regarding their informative capacity, Kimball lists war
involvement, land investment, budget priorities and admission policies
as areas the council will investigate. The goal is to provide a basis for
"informed negotiation."
"It's the duty of the Council of Presidents to let students know
when the Administration is working in the students' interest and when
it is not. Right now, they're (the Administration) not letting us
know," McHenry commented.
He cites as an example, the proposal of giving peace officer status
to campus police and stresses that no student input was asked for.
"This is something which affects us directly: students should have a
say in the decision."

Another example, on a larger scale, is the Willow Expressway issue.
"The trustees must meet with the people who have complaints,"
McHenry contends. "By the time the Trustees hear the complaints,
they have been distilled beyond recognition."
Referenda passed at the last ASSU election, concerning prohibition
of Stanford land use for U.S. military recruiting and war-related
corporations are seen by the Council as further instances of university
ignorance of student sentiment.
"Students have endorsed these referenda. This gives a mandate to
act," according to Diamond. "This includes strong support from the
ASSU office and active lobbying."
All four emphasise the need for widespread mobilization and the
inability of the Council to be truly effective if their commitment is
not accompanied by student effort.
Decisions to call police on campus is another major concern of the
Council and illustrates an area in which "we are actively trying to
form alternative decision-making machinery," Kimball said. "Lyman
has final responsibility in calling in the police. He is advised by a small
group of faculty members, who always represent only one kind of
input," Diamond stated.
Domino Theory
McHenry believes that calling in the police is "the result of the
Administration's belief in the domino theory. In other words, the
belief that if the Administration gives in here, they'll be forced to give
in everywhere. Thus, their only recourse is institutionalized violence.
Administratively, that's the decision to make, but it's an evasion," he
contends.
"It is clear to all of us that 'preservation of the University' is the
justification for calling police. But reason, not fear must be the basis
for decisions. Unless there is more rational input, there are going to be
more fearful decisions," argues Diamond. According to McHenry,
"The University president must further disperse his authority if
decisions are to have any credibility. If there is greater credibility,
there will be less conflict."
Committee Reforms
Concerning interaction with the Senate, Kimball emphasizes the
importance of reforming committee structure, noting that the
"present Nominations Committee is bogged down because of
numerous overlapping committees. We also hope to consolidate
faculty and student committees where appropriate."
McHenry who has a seat on the Nominations Committee, said he
will attempt to fill committee vacancies with "people that
complement our opinions, although not necessarily people who
always agree with us."
Complementary opinions are those "that do not represent a
fundamental roadblock to policies endorsed by the student body (as
evidenced by our election). "Since all student views can never be
represented, it always gets down to politics," he argues. "Therefore, 1
am not in favor of random selection."
"The Student Senate is becoming more and more discredited in the
eyes of the student body. They suspect hanky-panky. The important
thing in that case is to campaign against individuals, not to destroy the
Senate itself. This is an attempt on the part of conservatives to do
what radicals are so often accused of: trying to destroy a structure
without leaving anything in its place," McHenry continued.
At the present time, the $0 program fee still stands. The council
urges support of the $1 program fee initiative.
