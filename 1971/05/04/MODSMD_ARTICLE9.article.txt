# Mystery Tapestry Stolen From Toyon
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
A 17th century tapestry, on
permanent loan from the
University Museum, is missing
from Toyon Lounge.
Not only is the whereabouts of
the work unknown, but also the
approximate value, subject, and
history of the tapestry. In fact,
the Museum was told of its
disappearance by the Daily. It had
not been officially informed by
either the University, the Police or
Toyon Hall.
Dr. Forester-Hahn, curator of
the Museum, stated that the
tapestry has hung in the huge
dormitory lounge since Oct. 12,
1955. "The staff has completely
changed since that time. No one is
left who would know about the
tapestry," she said.
"We really ought to get an
official statement from the
dormitory on this." Dr. Forester-
Hahn concluded. "Your call was
the first thing we've heard about
this."
According to resident assistants
in Toyon, notification of the theft
was temporarily withheld pending

an initial investigation to
determine if the tapestry had
indeed been stolen. It was thought
that the theft might have been a
student prank, or a room
decorating project by a resident of
the dormitory. Now, however, the
tapestry is considered stolen.
Dr. Forester-Hahn expressed
surprise that the tapestry could
have been removed from the
lounge. "I've heard it's quite
large," she pointed out.
"Wouldn't it have taken at least
two men to carry it? How could
they have taken it down?"
These questions do need
answers. The tapestry, which is
believed to depict the death of
Roland, measured about 512 feet
by 7 feet, and must be quite
heavy. It was suspended by wires
above the huge Toyon fireplace,
and the bottom of the work is at
least six feet above the floor.
"All this was delayed
somewhat because no value was
given us for the article," reported
a University officer late
Wednesday afternoon. "A woman
from the museum just informed
us that its worth at least $1000."
