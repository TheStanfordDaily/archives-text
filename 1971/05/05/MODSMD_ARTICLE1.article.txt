# Bridges -- Center Of Controversy
## 
### LARRY HUMMER 
Sam Bridges does not act like a man
in the center of controversy. His dress
is not extraordinary for this campus —
wool cap, shades, beard, denin, and
carrying a knapsack.
He is mild-mannered and
soft-spoken. Yet it was Bridge's being
fired from his job as a maintenance
helper at the Med Center that sparked
last month's sit-in and arrests.
Bridges comes from Evansville,
Indiana, a city on the Ohio River. He
lived there until he joined the Army Air
Defense in 1965.
"I was a firing panel operator for
Nike-Hercules in the Bth Army. I ended
up on the rifle team. I was in Korea and
that was where I got on the rifle team.
It was an easy job, just getting out of
work."
He was released from the Army at
Ft. Lewis, Wash, and made his way
back home to Evansville, where he
stayed six months, before deciding to
travel around some.
Travelling
"I was in Chicago, Washington, D.C.
Different places. Mostly just checking
the scene, staying with friends." After
returning to Evansville for a while he
decided last July to come out to
California. "I'd never been here and I
wanted to see how it was."

He took up residence in East Palo
Alto, again staying with friends. "I had
a lot of time on my hands," Bridges
said. He read a lot: "Malcolm, Mao,
Panther stuff, 'Point of Production, a
pamphlet about worker's struggle in
Detroit."
Bridges decided he needed to get
work. A friend of his quit his job at the
Stanford Hospital, and Bridges was
hired to replace him.
Bridges' troubles in holding his job
began almost immediately. The
supervisor took him to see the foreman,
so that he could learn what duties were
involved in his job. The foreman asked
other workers to show Bridges what to
do. He says nobody ever did
completely explain his job to him, but
eventually he figured out most of it.
Good Job
Bridges was a maintenance helper.
His job was to pick up paper, sweep the
parking lot, and incinerate trash. He
liked his work, liked working outside.
But there were things he didn't like at
the hospital.
"When I got the job, I asked the
foreman why things were the way they
were, and about job advancement.
Someone would have to quit and I
would have to have been there six
months. The contradiction was, every

time somebody would quit, they'd hire
somebody from the outside.
"I wanted to know why it was so
blatantly racist. I didn't particularly
care about advancement. I liked the job
I had, being outside, rapping with
people.
"The hassle was, I was trying to rap
to people. People were volunteering
information to me, about firings,
working conditions."
According to Bridges, other workers
told him to be careful, that other
workers who had complained had been
fired in the past.
Bridges problems increased after a
conversation he had with one of the
engineers in the shop. They were
talking about the high cost of living.
Bridges said he told the engineer that
the hospital was racist. The engineer,
according to Bridges, told the rest of
the workers in the engineering
department what Bridges had said.
Apparently they didn't like what they
heard. "The people in the engineering
department," Bridges said, "they're all
pigs, or want to be pigs.
Meetings
"The next Monday I was told I
would have a meeting in the Minority
Representatives Office that afternoon
at 1:30. I asked them what it was and
they said 'y° u 'N find out.' It was a Job

Description Meeting. They asked me do
I know my job. I said yeah, because
nobody had complained. This was just
an excuse to get me up there to chastise
me for what I had said. They said if I
had any complaints to come talk to
them, not go talking to other
employees. They said there was to be a
union vote in a month."
At another meeting, Bridges notes, a
letter was given to him telling him to
not discuss politics, racial issues, or
religious beliefs on the job, except with
his supervisors.
"The next week I was meeting with
one of the lackeys (Uncle Toms means
the same thing, Bridges says). He
accused me of not doing my job." This
was the third complaint against Bridges
in two weeks; Bridges' supervisor
mediated.
"Nobody showed me my job in the
first place," Bridges said. "Why did
they wait? You're not going to wait
two weeks to tell him his job." At the
end of the meeting, at which nothing
further was done to Bridges, the
supervisor told both Bridges and the
complainant that they were not
communicating.
The next week, there was a BSU
meeting with workers at Tresidder. "I
went to my foreman, my supervisor;

motivated.
