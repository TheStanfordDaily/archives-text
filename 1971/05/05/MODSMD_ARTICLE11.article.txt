Ulbricht Steps Down
BERLIN — Walter Ulbricht, the most durable of Europe's
Communist leaders, surrendered his two-decade grip on power
Monday by resigning as first secretary of East Germany's
Communist party.
In a sudden announcement from East Berlin, the East
German news agency, ADN, revealed that the 77-year-old
Ulbricht had quit for reasons of age and health.
Succeeding him as first secretary — the most powerful
position in East Germany — is Erich Honecker, 58, who had
long been regarded as Ulbricht's heir apparent.
Ulbricht was the architect of the Berlin Wall, ordering it
erected in 1961 to stop the flow of refugees to the west.
Big Pot Haul At Sea
SAN FRANCISCO — A 20-minute sea chase outside the
Golden Gate resulted in seizure of a 60-foot yacht and five tons
of marijuana, largest single haul in U.S. history, the Bureau of
Customs reported yesterday.
Two persons were arrested aboard the "Mercy Wiggins" and
six others in coordinated seizures of another 39-foot yacht in
San Francisco Bay and a bus-type camper at the St. Francis
Marina, agents said.
A Coast Guard cutter halted the "Mercy Wiggins" late

Monday about 10 miles off the Golden Gate Bridge. Customs
agents boarding from thi> cutter seized the yaehtand its cargo.
A customs spokesman estimated the marijuana's street sale
value at more than $1 million.
Sit-in Staged At Kent
KENT, Ohio — About 200 Kent State University students
lounged outside a closed building housing ROTC offices last
night as memorial activities for four students shot to death by
National Guardsman a year ago drew to a close.
The university closed the building earlier yesterday several
hundred students sat down in front of it. Many of them drifted
away, however, as dusk approached. And the ranks of those
who remained constituted only a small percentage of the
thousands of students who participated in other memorial
activities during the four-day observances.
Student leaders said the purpose of the demonstration at
Rockwell Hall was to shut down ROTC at Kent State and test
the constitutionality of Ohio's campus disruption law.
A spokesman for the Faculty Senate told the students who
remained outside the building that they would be arrested at 6
a.m. today when university employees were to return to work
at the building.
There was no immediate explanation of what charge the
demonstrators might be arrested on or official verification that
arrests were under consideration.
