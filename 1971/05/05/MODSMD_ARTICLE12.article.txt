# Demonstrators Plan S.F. Rally
## 
### 
One hundred twenty-five students
met in Serra House Lounge last night to
discuss participation in today's Mayday
demonstrations in San Francisco.
Many of the demonstrators will ride
trains into the City early this morning
leafleting commuters. Once in the city,
Stanford students will leaflet train and
bus stations, the International Building
at 601 California St., the neighboring
Tenneco Building, and adjacent parking

garages. More militant tactics, such as
"stall-ins," may follow.
Other locations targeted for
demonstrations include the offices of
US Steel, the Shell Oil Company,
Standard Oil of California, the Bank of
America, the Wells Fargo and
Crocker-Citizens Banks, and the Aetna
Life Insurance Company.
A leaflet distributed yesterday to
downtown city businesses by the San

Francisco Police warned of disruptions
and possible injuries. San Francisco
Police Chief Alfred Nelder said
yesterday, "We anticipate trouble and
are prepared for it," adding that he
expects "avowed revolutionaries" in
the streets rather than "dedicated
pacifists."
Bay Area police agencies and the
Highway Patrol are prepared to assist
Nelder if necessary.
