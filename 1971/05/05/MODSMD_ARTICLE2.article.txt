## Medical Center Worker Assaulted 
### 
Mary Jane Schmidt, a Caucasian
employee of the Stanford Medical
Center, was assaulted in her home
Sunday night by two unidentified black
men.
Schmidt, who is employed as a
medical records supervisor, reported
the incident to the San Mateo County
sheriff's office early Monday and was
admitted to the Stanford Hospital with
a fractured rib and internal bleeding.
Schmidt claimed that the attackers
said, "We told you to respect the work
stoppage," a reference to the
short-lived job action undertaken by
black and chicano workers at the
hospital early last week. One assailant
called her a "white pig."
Schmidt, 41, said that she opened
the door of her apartment at 1941
Cooley Avenue, East Palo Alto, at
about 9:30 p.m. Sunday night. The two
men then forced their way into the
apartment.
One bound her while the other
singed her face with a cigarette lighter.
They struck her with their fists, and
after she fell to the ground began
kicking her in the addomen.
The men — one about 5-foot-7, 130
pounds, the other 6-foot-2 and heavily

built — escaped in a two-door cream
and green 1966 Chevrolet sedan with
out-of-state license plates.
Sheriffs deputies have begun an
intensive search for the attackers.
Hospital spokesmen offered
contradictory statements regarding
Schmidt. Yesterday afternoon the
DAILY was told that she was still a
patient there, but was not able to speak
to a reporter; yesterday evening it was
reported that "she has not been
admitted; we don't know where she is."
According to the Stanford News
Service, hospital officials are not
disclosing her whereabouts for reasons
of her personal safety.
Schmidt reported that last week she
received two anonymous telephone

calls threatening reprisals if she did not
honor the work stoppage.
However, a leader of the work
stoppage told the DAILY last night
that it was an entirely non-coercive
effort. Nadine Ellis of the Black United
Front stated that the picket line placed
at the hospital in conjunction with the
work stoppage was an informational
one only. "It was made clear to the
pickets — no one would be stopped if
he felt he had to go to work. There was
no form of intimidation," she said.
Ellis was uncertain as to the number
of white workers who stayed away
from their jobs, but she stated that the
stoppage was black-organized and led.
Black leaders of the work stoppage
made no attempt to force whites to

stay off their jobs. The pickets spoke to
the workers, she pointed out, "but the
workers could choose whether or not
to go to work."
Provost William Miller told the
Faculty Senate last Thursday that there
had been 18 confirmed reports of
intimidation of both black and white
hospital employees since the April 9
sit-in ended in violence.
Miller also noted that hospital
officials were "troubled by the
presence of outside forces there."
The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday that Palo Alto police have
entered the case "on the likelihood that
the attack was connected with the
disturbances at the hospital."
