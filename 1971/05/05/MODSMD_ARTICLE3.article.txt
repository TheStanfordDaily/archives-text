# Senate Certifies Election
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
The Student Senate certified the
results of the ASSU elections last night,
ending an 18 day delay. Previous
failures to certify the election results
with the exception of the Council of
Presidents vote, had angered many
Senators, prompting a conservative
walkout at last week's meeting.
In a near unanimous vote, the
Senate gave official acknowledgement
to the tabulations of 11 ballot issues,
including the April 8 passage of the
controversial budget initiative. This
proposal included a provision which
forbids transferral of ASSU
Underwriting Reserve Funds without
approval of a majority of the student
body.
The Senate voted on April 14 to
make two such transfers, both of which
were quickly vetoed by ASSU President
Pat Shea. These actions raised an
interesting Constitutional question:
which action should take precedence,
the budget initiative (upon its
certification), or the expected Senate
motion to override Shea's veto?
Senate Vote First
Senate Chairman Mike Dawson has
ruled that any motion to override will
take precedence, since the transfer
resolutions were passed by the Senate
prior to Senate certification of the
election. His decision is binding.
Nonetheless, conservative senators
felt the Senate majority was trying to
stall certification of the election results
until after it could act on Shea's veto.
Travis Hudson, a moderate,
speculated on why certification finally
occured. "The group not in favor (of
certification) realized it was bad
politics to try to obiterate the results of
student elections," he stated. Hudson
referred specifically to the recent
student body endorsement of a
zero-dollar ASSU fee assessment. Many
feel the vote was in part a reaction to
the Senate's attempts to transfer ASSU
reserve funds.
Chairman Dawson analysed the
delay quite differently. "1 feel it was
half due to people walking out while
the Senate tried to conduct its
business," he commented, "and also in
part due to the fact that Louis

Humphrey did not attend last week's
meeting."
COP Projects
ASSU President Doug McHenry
informed the Senate of several Council
of President projects during his report.
He announced that a commercial bank
had offered to set up a branch office in
Tresidder whose services would include
free checking accounts for students.
McHenry stated that his progress in
researching this proposal has been
blocked by a lack of cooperation from
the Stanford business office.
McHenry also announced that an ad
hoc committee was investigating
inefficient management and

inadequacies at Tresidder Union. He
stated that any senator or any other
person interested in working on the
committee would be welcome. Scott
Burke, a member of the committee,
said that it hopes to hold open
investigatory meetings concerning the
management of Tresidder.
The Senate also named three persons
to fill vacancies on the Committee on
Nominations. They are Herb Borock,
John Minor and Scott Burke.
After some protests that they did
not represent the point of view of most
of the student body, three students
from Columbae House were named to
the President's Committee on ROTC
affairs.
