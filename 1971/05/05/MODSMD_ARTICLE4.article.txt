Police arrested 2900 persons in Washington, D.C. antiwar demonstrations
yesterday, bringing the two-day arrest total there to more than 9,700.
Twenty-three hundred of the arrests occured when police sealed off a road in
front of the Justice Department, and declared the demonstrators' assembly illegal.
Those arrested were charged with illegal assembly and disorderly conduct and
were not eligible to be released on $10 collateral.
Earlier in the day, 700 persons were arrested for attempting to block traffic for
the second straight'day. Their attempts were largely unsuccessful, and government
operations were not affected. Police resorted only infrequently to the use ol tear
gas.
Mayday Tribe spokesmen said the demonstrators would take to the streets
again at noon today. Capitol Hill is the tentative object of their protests, which
are scheduled to mark the end of the "Spring Offensive.' Other antiwar protests
are scheduled today in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Philadelphia, Boston,
Cleveland and other cities to publicize a moratorium on "business as usual."
At the Justice Department demonstrators were given eight minutes to leave the
area or face arrest. Most stayed, and were quickly arrested by hundreds of
Washington police. John Froines, charged along with Rennie Davis with
conspiracy in connection with Monday's disruptions, was one of those arrested at
the Justice Department. Froines and Davis are members of the 'Chicago Seven.'
Nearly 1500 of the more than 7,000 persons arrested Monday were still in city
jails, but were expected to be released overnight. Most were being released after
posting $10 collateral.
About 2,000 troops were on duty throughout the day, mostly on the four
bridges across the Potomac River, and most of the 12,000 troops near the city
were being sent home last night.
Most of the demonstrators allowed themselves to be peacefully arrested.
Singing and dancing to the accompaniment of guitars and flutes, they waved to
office workers before entering police busses and bench-equipped moving vans for
the ride to city jails.
