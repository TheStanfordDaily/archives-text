# King Of Hobo Visits Campus; Discusses Life On The Road
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Richard Wilson doesn't exactly remind you of King George
V, but nevertheless, he's a king — the official King of the
Hobos. Far out, huh?
Dick, or "The Pennsylvania Kid," as he's more commonly
known, stopped by Stanford last week, busy doing what hobo
kings presumably do: humming around the country like a hobo
and occasionally being written up by newspapers that are hard
up for copy.
As far as bumming around the country goes, Dick probably
has some sort of record, having been "on the road" for 46
years and having traveled some 200,000 miles. "I now lost the
exact count at 150,000," he explains in a peculiar dialect
resulting from his total lack of teeth.
Like any king, Dick stands out from the masses, a fact
largely due to his "royal attire." Dick's "crown" is an old
beatup hat, impossible to see however, since it is covered with
thousands of weird objects ranging from"I Like Girls" buttons
to necklaces to feathers.
His mantle is some ancient coveralls embroidered with
buttons proclaiming "Buffalo Bill Lives," or an unusual fall
color mugshot of Jesus Christ.
"Folks just give me the stuff," the 64 year old regent says.
uick gets elected monarch of his somewhat unusual
kingdom at the annual Hobos convention in Britt, lowa each
summer.
Why do hobos hold their convention In Britt, Iowa? Because
that's where they moved it from Danville in 1900," says Dick.
(Danville, by the way, for those of you who come from
Milpitas, is in Illinois.)
looking ahead to this summer's royal elections, Dick is
pretty confident. "Most of the people that run against me are
just winos and trash," he says generously of his opponents.
What has Dick been doing on the road for so far and so
long? "Learnin' a lot," he says.
In case you don't have 46 years to travel around 200,000
miles, to get a real education, here is some of the stuff Dick has
learned and a few of his observations:
—"A person should learn to read and write," he says. Dick's
favorite authors are Benjamin Franklin, Socrates, Confusius,
Thomas Jefferson, and Disraeli.
—On police: "They've improved a lot Johnny Bull 1930's
(forerunner of today's term "pig") used to really be shitty

They'd shoot up our camps, beat us up, and give us time to
boot." "The kid" figures he's been busted about 300 times and
that he's spent over three years in prison, mainly on charges of
vagrancy.
—On grass: "I don't like it. It gives me a headache. I guess
it's okay if you use it right. But it's bad if you make a habit out
of it, just like sex, drinking and work."
—On Vietnam: "I don't approve of it. I guess they just tryin'
to cut down on the population, and no one's just going to
stand up and say "Let's kill some people," so we send folks
uver there to kill people and try an make it seem honorable
when it really ain't."
—On radicals: "They really ain't. When you get some of
these old guys in there (positions of power) that won't move,
you got to kick 'em out, burn 'em out, or do somethin."'
—On electoral politics: "You can never get the fellas in ya
want. I like Ike, Hoover, and Coolidge."
—On food: "Gas is bad for you, so don't eat beans, meat or
onions. Just eat cabbage, carrots, celery, and nuts."
Does Dick ever plan to settle down? "If 1 could find a
woman with a farm, I might like to raise some chickens and
goats and write a book," Dick muses.
But judging from Dick's love of the road, it appears that
leaving the life of the Hobo would really "bum" him out, so to
speak.

Hobos. Far out, huh?
Dick, or "The Pennsylvania Kid," as he's more commonly
known, stopped by Stanford last week, busy doing what hobo
kings presumably do: humming around the country like a hobo
and occasionally being written up by newspapers that are hard
up for copy.
As far as bumming around the country goes, Dick probably
has some sort of record, having been "on the road" for 46
years and having traveled some 200,000 miles. "I now lost the
exact count at 150,000," he explains in a peculiar dialect
resulting from his total lack of teeth.
Like any king, Dick stands out from the masses, a fact
largely due to his "royal attire." Dick's "crown" is an old
beatup hat, impossible to see however, since it is covered with
thousands of weird objects ranging from"I Like Girls" buttons
to necklaces to feathers.
His mantle is some ancient coveralls embroidered with
buttons proclaiming "Buffalo Bill Lives," or an unusual fall
color mugshot of Jesus Christ.
"Folks just give me the stuff," the 64 year old regent says.
uick gets elected monarch of his somewhat unusual
kingdom at the annual Hobos convention in Britt, lowa each
summer.
Why do hobos hold their convention In Britt, Iowa? Because
that's where they moved it from Danville in 1900," says Dick.
(Danville, by the way, for those of you who come from
Milpitas, is in Illinois.)
looking ahead to this summer's royal elections, Dick is
pretty confident. "Most of the people that run against me are
just winos and trash," he says generously of his opponents.
What has Dick been doing on the road for so far and so
long? "Learnin' a lot," he says.
In case you don't have 46 years to travel around 200,000
miles, to get a real education, here is some of the stuff Dick has
learned and a few of his observations:
—"A person should learn to read and write," he says. Dick's
favorite authors are Benjamin Franklin, Socrates, Confusius,
Thomas Jefferson, and Disraeli.
—On police: "They've improved a lot Johnny Bull 1930's
(forerunner of today's term "pig") used to really be shitty

They'd shoot up our camps, beat us up, and give us time to
boot." "The kid" figures he's been busted about 300 times and
that he's spent over three years in prison, mainly on charges of
vagrancy.
—On grass: "I don't like it. It gives me a headache. I guess
it's okay if you use it right. But it's bad if you make a habit out
of it, just like sex, drinking and work."
—On Vietnam: "I don't approve of it. I guess they just tryin'
to cut down on the population, and no one's just going to
stand up and say "Let's kill some people," so we send folks
uver there to kill people and try an make it seem honorable
when it really ain't."
—On radicals: "They really ain't. When you get some of
these old guys in there (positions of power) that won't move,
you got to kick 'em out, burn 'em out, or do somethin."'
—On electoral politics: "You can never get the fellas in ya
want. I like Ike, Hoover, and Coolidge."
—On food: "Gas is bad for you, so don't eat beans, meat or
onions. Just eat cabbage, carrots, celery, and nuts."
Does Dick ever plan to settle down? "If 1 could find a
woman with a farm, I might like to raise some chickens and
goats and write a book," Dick muses.
But judging from Dick's love of the road, it appears that
leaving the life of the Hobo would really "bum" him out, so to
speak.
Richard Wilson doesn't exactly remind you of King George
V, but nevertheless, he's a king — the official King of the
