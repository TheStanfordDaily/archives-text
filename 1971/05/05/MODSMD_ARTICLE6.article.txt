# racism and repression
## Not Who? But Why?

For a moment, we need to
look beyond the $5000 reward
and beyond the necessity to find
the persons involved in the blast
at Lyman's office, the fire in
Junipero and the bomb threat
phoned in to a Black freshman
coed (the latter of which isn't
included in the $5000 reward).
Why was Lyman's office
bombed? For that matter, why is
the Bank of America bombed,
why was the Capitol bombed, and
why are any other number of
institutional symbols bombed?
The superficial answer is that
these are acts of terrorism
designed to intensify the already
evident repression that stems from
those institutions. This repression,
in turn, is supposed to polarize
the population even more so than
it is polarized now. And this
polarization should inevitably lead
to "The Revolution."
But why "The Revolution"?
The system upon which

democracy was built, and upon
which democracy survives, is a
slow and bureaucratic one.
Changes evolve from years,
decades, centuries of committee
meetings, Congressional sessions
and compromises. The changes are
so minute (and for the most part,
so unrelated) in comparison to the
needs of the people for whom the
changes are made. Thus "The
Revolution".
Perhaps a more disturbing
occurence was that of the fire in
the lounge of Junipero. Arson?
But why set a fire in a part of
building in which 75 students
slept? Was death the intent or was
intimidation?
In connection with this was the
bomb threat to a Black freshman
coed who is a resident of
Junipero, and who, incidentally, is
an active member of the BSU.
Also in connection was the
destruction by fire of Ed Hayes'
car, (who, incidentally is in charge

of Legal Defense for those
arrested at the Med Center.) Why
suddenly are Blacks being
attacked? It used to be just the
white politicos who played in the
sandbox. Is this a form of
intimidation (and why?)
The basic question is "Why?"
We must all look beyond the
"Who did it?" Underlying these
events are the matters of racism
and repression: racism and
repression as they exist on this
campus; as they are perpetuated
by Stanford; and as they succeed
because of the system.
We are all afraid to help better
the lives of others because we
might have something to lose (as
in the Hospital incident). We are
afraid to change the bureaucratic
system because we might have
something to lose (as in the
symbol of Lyman's office). And
above all, someone out there is
afraid to let someone else change
things because he might have
something to lose (as in the fires
at Junipero and in Ed Hayes' car).
Those who were impressed by
the Trustees' $5000 reward need
to look beyond it, for all it does is
award property for finding those
who destroyed property with no
mention of the possibility of loss
of human life, much less the
underlying matters of racism and
need for change. Those who were
impressed need to realize that
$5000 does not seek to eradicate
racism and repression nor correct
a bureaucracy which accomplishes
little, nor soothe the concern for
safety that the Lyman family and
the residents of Junipero have.
Is property more valuable than
human lives?
