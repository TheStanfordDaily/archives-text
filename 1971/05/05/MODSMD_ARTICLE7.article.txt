support
Dear Dr. Lyman:
We, the undersigned
post-graduate fellows in Black
Studies of the Danforth
Foundation and the National
Endowment for the Humanities,
wish to express our support of the
11 demands, the basis for
negotiations, issued to the
administrations of Stanford
University and of the Stanford
Medical Center by the Black and
Latin Workers' coalition.
We acknowledge that
essentially we are guests on this
campus. As such, we have kept
ourselves largely out of campus
politics and turmoil. We are
deeply grateful for the privileges
and facilities put before us for the
expeditious pursuance of our
individual academic endeavors. We
believe that the intellectual
opportunity extended to us by
our supportive organizations and
our host institution is of
inestimable benefit to ourselves as
individuals and, hopefully, will be
also to the academic community
at large.
We acknowledge, too, that the
very nature of Black Studies is to
be oriented toward action as well
as toward academics. In most
cases, if not indeed all, the two
orientations are inseparably one;
therefore we cannot restrict
ourselves entirely to research
activities. In that spirit we submit
this letter to you.
Besides expressing our support
of those demands, we wish to

express our belief that the course
of action embarked upon by the
administrations of the University
and the Medical Center runs
counter to the purposes and goals
of a university. The refusal to halt
further investigations and the
possible issuance of arrest
warrants insure that crucial
matters, parts, of the whole story
will never be revealed- out of fear
of prosecution or fear of being
betrayed again.
Consequently, all future
negotiations may well be
undermined and largely invalid.
They will be suspect because full
weight decisions will be made on
partial and lopsided evidence.
These decisions will be accepted
as true by many who convince
themselves that they (the
decisions) were made with full
knowledge. There will yet remain
a minority, however, who knows
the whole story, the truth.
It is our considered opinion
that because of the several refusals
listed above, the meeting you had
at your "own suggestion" with
the Black Student Union could
not have any ameliorating effects
on the racial problems on the
campus, in the surrounding
communities, or on the Medical
Center issues because the
conditions under which that
meeting took place were rife with
constrictions and could not
possibly, without a drastic change
in policy, have been open and
free.
This situation is that which all
minority and poor people face. It
is a situation the amelioration of
which requires tremendous
concentration and effort,
elements which jometimes
become obscured in the
excitement and tension of a crisis.
We feel that every administrative
move and decision accomplished

in the last several weeks (and here
we include all the proceedings
prior to the Medical Center Good
Friday Confrontation) that
concern themselves with the cases
of Sam Bridges and Dr. Jose
Aguilar have only perpetuated
racism and racial strife on this
campus, in the surrounding
communities, and in the nation.
We, therefore, because of the
particular racial nature of the
Medical Center issues and the area
of our collective and particular
expertise, urge you to take
administrative actions which will
reflect the full and impartial
knowledge of a situation and will
fight to overcome racism on the
campus and in the surrounding
communities, and will take a
nationwide leading position to
combat racism in all its forms.

name-calling
Editor, THE DAILY:
I'm distressed at the baseless
assertions by several persons
quoted in Monday's Daily that I
have attempted to impute blame
for the fire in Junipero to any
organization. At no time have I
made any statements that linked
the fire to any organization or
political viewpoint. On the
contrary, I have gone out of my
way, on television as well as in

statements to the press, to deny
knowledge of any evidence
connecting the fire with other
terroristic acts on campus, let
alone evidence to indicate who is
responsible for the fire.
We certainly do not need any
further intensification of
name-calling in this situation. In
fact, all speculation about the
identity of the arsonist merely
intensifies the fears and
animosities that are among the
inevitable consequence of such
acts.
