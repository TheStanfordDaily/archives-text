# Laxmen Split Pair On Colorado Trip
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
The Stanford Lacrosse team
returned from Colorado on
Monday after a win over Colorado
College on Saturday and a defeat
at the hands of a strong Denver
University club on Monday. The
Stanford team was without the
services of co-captain Chip
Love man who was injured in the
team's trip down south earlier this
season.
On Saturday the Indian club
easily handled Colorado College,
winning 7-5. Though the margin
of victory was only two goals, the
visitors were in control
throughout the game. Coach Bill
Eakland was pleased with the
team effort of his club. Five goals
were accompanied by assist, a
high percentage for the Stanford
team.

Butch Hazelett and Dave
Denton led the Card attack with
two goals apiece. Sophomore
Larry Crawford also played well,
tallying one goal and assisting one
other. Dave Anderson and Ted
Suen were the other scorers for
Stanford.
Eakland pointed out that some
inexperienced players* such as
Crawford put in outstanding
performances. Fred Choate played
a fine game, turning aside eighteen
shots.
On Monday the Cards were
routed by an inspired DU club,
14-3. In the first half the Indian
stick men only managed two shots
on net, both of which were goals.
The Denver club dominated play
throughout the game. "We barely
saw the ball in the first half," said
coach Eakland.

The game was won at midfield
where DU outplayed their
Stanford counterparts. The host
also employed a zone-ride offense
which the Cards couldn't break
until late in the second half.
The Cards trailed 7-2 at
halftime, as their only two shots
were goals. DU exploded for seven
more goals in the third quarter
putting the game out of reach.
Though the Indians held Dl
scoreless in the fourth quarter, the
hosts were using mostly second
and third stringers.
In spite of the fourteen goals,
Card netminder Fred Choate again
played a fine game.
The Stanford team faces UCLA
on Friday at 2 p.m. and Oregon
on Sunday at 1 p.m. Both teams
have relatively weak squads
according to Eakland. Both games
are at Stanford.
