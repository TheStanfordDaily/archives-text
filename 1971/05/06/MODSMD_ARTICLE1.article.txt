# Threatened Worker Dies
## 
### 
James Mayfield, a black
maintainence employee at Stanford
hospital involved in the Sam Bridges
case died Monday of a heart attack.
Mayfield was reported to have received
threatening phone calls regarding the
employee walkout at the hospital
according to a confidential report by
Hospital Director Dr. Thomas Gonda
cited in the Palo Alto Times.
Although no connection between
Mayfield's heart attack and death
intimidating phone calls has been
established, the hospital report
documenting eighteen cases of
intimidation of black and white
hospital workers is being kept
confidential. Medical Center News
Bureau Information Officer Spyros G.
Andreopoulos told the Daily the report
will remain confidential because of
possible legal implications of the case.
According to the Palo Alto Times
James Siena, legal advisor to President
Lyman stated yesterday that "We're
looking into the possibility of taking
some legal action based on the report."
The Times interview with Warren
Thorpe, assistant chief engineer at the
hospital and Mayfield and Bridge's
supervisor revealed Thorpe's feeling
that "Mayfield would be a prime target
for threats because he testified about
Bridges' work." Thorpe declined to cite
his sources but noted that he had heard
of Mayfield's intimidation from
"reliable sources," in the engineering
department.
Mayfield, known to his friends as
"Big Jim," due to his overweight
condition was described by Thorpe as
being very well liked and as having no
enemies. Thorpe also noted that "He
was the kind of employee who never

took sick leave. You just had to tell
him to take a vacation because he just
kept on working." Mavfield had taken
one of those rare sick leaves of his 14
year career at the hospital the week
before last Monday's work stoppage
when many black employees walked
off of their jobs.
Mayfield worked with the refuse
compactor and the incinerator at the
hospital, a job which often brought him
in contact with the central figure of the
recent labor controversy Sam Bridges.
Both workers had Thorpe as their
supervisor. Thorpe's resignation has
been sought by a coalition of black

workers and radical non-workers.
Mayfield is survived by a son, a
daughter and four grandchildren all
living in San Francisco.
The original 18 cases of
intimidation, 17 of them of black
workers have been submitted to
Provost Miller. The beating of Miss
Maryjane Schmidt, a records worker,
reported in yesterday's Daily is not
among those cases. It is not known at
this time what action, if any, will be
taken by the hospital or the University
or whether any attempt to link the
phone calls and Mayfield's heart attack
death will be made.

James Mayfield, a black
maintainence employee at Stanford
hospital involved in the Sam Bridges
case died Monday of a heart attack.
Mayfield was reported to have received
threatening phone calls regarding the
employee walkout at the hospital
according to a confidential report by
Hospital Director Dr. Thomas Gonda
cited in the Palo Alto Times.
Although no connection between
Mayfield's heart attack and death
intimidating phone calls has been
established, the hospital report
documenting eighteen cases of
intimidation of black and white
hospital workers is being kept
confidential. Medical Center News
Bureau Information Officer Spyros G.
Andreopoulos told the Daily the report
will remain confidential because of
possible legal implications of the case.
According to the Palo Alto Times
James Siena, legal advisor to President
Lyman stated yesterday that "We're
looking into the possibility of taking
some legal action based on the report."
The Times interview with Warren
Thorpe, assistant chief engineer at the
hospital and Mayfield and Bridge's
supervisor revealed Thorpe's feeling
that "Mayfield would be a prime target
for threats because he testified about
Bridges' work." Thorpe declined to cite
his sources but noted that he had heard
of Mayfield's intimidation from
"reliable sources," in the engineering
department.
Mayfield, known to his friends as
"Big Jim," due to his overweight
condition was described by Thorpe as
being very well liked and as having no
enemies. Thorpe also noted that "He
was the kind of employee who never

took sick leave. You just had to tell
him to take a vacation because he just
kept on working." Mavfield had taken
one of those rare sick leaves of his 14
year career at the hospital the week
before last Monday's work stoppage
when many black employees walked
off of their jobs.
Mayfield worked with the refuse
compactor and the incinerator at the
hospital, a job which often brought him
in contact with the central figure of the
recent labor controversy Sam Bridges.
Both workers had Thorpe as their
supervisor. Thorpe's resignation has
been sought by a coalition of black

workers and radical non-workers.
Mayfield is survived by a son, a
daughter and four grandchildren all
living in San Francisco.
The original 18 cases of
intimidation, 17 of them of black
workers have been submitted to
Provost Miller. The beating of Miss
Maryjane Schmidt, a records worker,
reported in yesterday's Daily is not
among those cases. It is not known at
this time what action, if any, will be
taken by the hospital or the University
or whether any attempt to link the
phone calls and Mayfield's heart attack
death will be made.
