# New Jersey Senator Lashes Agnew

### WARD HEADSTROM DAN BRENNER 
Senator Harrison Williams (D.-N.J.) chairman of the Senate
Committee of Labor and Public Welfare, spoke on "The Press and the
Presidency" late Wednesday afternoon, before a small audience of
around 60 at Tresidder.
Williams denounced recent administration attacks on the mass
media. The senator expressed his conviction that recent comments by
Vice-President Agnew and Republican Party chairman Robert Dole
constitute a "very real threat" to the American tradition of a free
press.
During the hour-long speech, Williams drew a parallel between the
presidential usurption of Congressional powers in the Indochina war
and the recent attacks of administration spokesmen on the press.
"They have also," he noted, "employed unrestrained, malicious,
and unsupported rhetoric to erode public confidence in the press.
And, in the case of broadcast journalists, they have raised 'he
unmistakable threat of government regulation."
He cited President Nixon's use of "special knowledge" under"
under which he said "the President holds himself to be aloof from
criticism because he has special knowledge which no one else
possesses."
Referring to the chief executive's ability to "remove himself from

criticism," the Senator commented, "The American President never
has to confront his critics openly unless he chooses to —and few do."
After his prepared remarks, Senator Williams responded to
questions from the floor. He emphasized, in one response, that the
Constitution, not legislation, was the proper regulator to protect the
rights of the free press.
As for the recent police search of the Stanford Daily offices, he
declined to comment, but said he was aware of the situation.
On political matters, the Senator felt that Congressman Paul (Pete)
McCloskey might do quite well against President Nixon in the New
Hampshire primary if the California legislator choses to enter. As for
Nixon's prospects, Harrison said, "He's in trouble." Then, noting the
KZSU microphone present, he joked, "the radio doesn't see me
smiling. I'm smiling."
Commenting on the new eighteen-year old voters, he thinks that
they will be more "issue oriented" and the majority will probably
seek a new administration.
