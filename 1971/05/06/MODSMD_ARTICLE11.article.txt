U Thant Calls For Summit
CHICAGO - U.N. Secretary-General U Thant has called for
a five-power summit conference that would include
Communist China and predicted such a session would have
a great impact on ending the Indochina war and breaking
the deadlock on nuclear disarmament.
He described the Indochina war as the most inhuman in
all history, and deplored the lack of progress at the Paris
peace talks.
Abbie Arrested
WASHINGTON - FBI agents arrested yippie leader Abbie
Hoffman at his Manhattan apartment late Wednesday night
on charges of interstate travel to incite a riot and assaulting
a police officer during antiwar demonstrations here.

Washington Protest
WASHINGTON — Three thousand demonstrators
carried their antiwar campaign to the doorstep of Congress
Wednesday, and nearly 1,200 were jailed in the third
straight day of mass arrests.
As a few sympathetic congressmen looked on after
participating themselves in the generally peaceful rally,
police loaded protesters who refused to disperse into buses
and drove them to a sports arena used for detention.
There were two incidents, meanwhile, in which dissident
youths returned to their traffic stalling tactics ol the
previous two days.
Maryland State Police used tear gas to clear an estimated
5,000 demonstrators off U.S. 1, one of the principal
roadways and ordered National Guardsmen onto the

University of Maryland campus, where the crowd had
gathered.
At least three troopers were hurt in the highway
disturbance.
$$$ Crisis
FRANKFURT, Germany — Several European government
banks stopped buying American currency Wednesday in the
face of a massive rush to sell dollars.
Money experts hurried into consultations on ways to
head off Europe's worst monetary crisis since 1969.
A continued gold rush could add pressure for
devaluation of the dollar.
The U.S. government is expected to "borrow" billions
of dollars from banks in Europe and possibly to make other
moves to stem the crisis.
Spy Satellite Launched
CAPE KENNEDY, Fla. - Under a mantle of secrecy, the
Air Force rocketed a spy satellite into space Wednesday to
monitor Russian and Red Chinese missile tests and to
provide almost instant alert of a long-range rocket attack.
The 1,800-pound super spy would sound a 30-minute
warning of such an attack.
The new pay load was aimed to hover 24,000 miles
above Southeast Asia.
