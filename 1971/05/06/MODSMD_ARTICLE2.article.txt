Nadine Ellis was incorrectly
identified in yesterday's Daily as a
member of the Black United Front.
Ellis is not a member of the BUF, and
she has stated to the Daily that she did
not consider herself a leader of the
work stoppage, as the story in
yesterday's Daily claimed.
Ellis has also denied stating "There
was no form of intimidation"
connected with the work stoppage. She
states that she told our reporter "there
was to be no intimidation." Our
reporter believes his quote was correct,
he adds that it is possible he did not
hear the two words which Ellis states
were omitted.
The Daily apologizes for any errors
in this story.
