# Police Contain Activists At May Day Protest
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
An avowed attempt to shut down
operations in San Francisco's Financial
District was thwarted yesterday as city
police arrested 97 persons, keeping the
rest of the 1000 demonstrators
effectively disorganized throughout the
day.
Police used horses, minibikes,
motorcycles, and squad cars in an
effort to keep traffic moving and
businesses operating.
Despite their intentions to stop
normal business in the area, the
demonstrators posed only minor
inconveniences to financial district
workers.
Traffic ran almost normally, and no
buildings were blocked. Property
damage was slight.
The various activities of the day
were centered on two major targets, the
Bank of America headquarters on
Kearney Street and the Standard Oil
Building on Market Street.
The morning activities were
nondisruptive throughout. Although
many downtown garages reported
parking substantially down from
normal, planned stall-ins never
materialized. Demonstrators distributed
copies of the Peoples' Peace Treaty at
garages and street corners, across the
district. One group of Stanford
students picketed the Pacific Mutual
Building, which houses offices of the
Board of Trustees.

At the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
on Sansome Street, demonstrators
talked with the leafletted personnel
before barred doors.
Guerilla theater groups performed in
front of the Bank of America Building
before a group of 80-100 people.
At 11 a.m. groups leafletting various
sections of the financial district met in
front of Standard Oil Company's
Market Street offices. Numbering about
400, they attempted to block Market
Street, but were confined to the
sidewalks by mounted police in riot
gear.
Forty minutes later the crowd left
Market Street, marching down Sutter
and Kearney Streets to the Bank of
America. Approximately 1000 people
filled Giannini Plaza in front of the
building for a noon rally and guerilla
theater dancing.
Shortly after noon, protestors set
fire to an American flag. A young
secretary from the Bank of America
rushed into the plaza and put out the
flames.
Shortly thereafter, a group of
demonstrators left the plaza and moved
down California Street towards
Montgomery. They were followed by
mounted police, who were themselves
followed by another, larger group of
demonstrators who flowed into the
street.
A number of firecrackers exploded,
and random trashing of newspaper

stands and trash cans occurred. At
12:20 p.m. police began to clear the
California Street sidewalk, charging
demonstrators and lunching workers
alike. Traffic in the block between
Montgomery and Kearney was snarled,
by 12:25 p.m. when police made their
first arrest of the afternoon.
The mass of the demonstrators then
left the plaza, moving down California
and turning south onto Battery, where
the first major violence occured. As
police were trying to clear the street for
traffic, demonstrators downed five
minibikes.
To continue the traffic jam,
approximately 60 people sat down at
the intersection of Sansome and Bush.
Police, gunning their cars through the
area, immediately opened it.
At 1:15 p.m. the police declared it
an unlawful assembly. The policeman
also remarked, "We will disperse this
mob." Police drove people over a 10
foot drop at the Crown Zellerbach
Building and, extensively using clubs,
cleared the area at the base of Battery
Street.
Following the dispersal of the illegal
assembly on Bush, a number of
demonstrators regrouped in the Gianini
Plaza. In an effort to keeo the crowds
dispersed, police cleared demonstrators
off sidewalks on California up to Grant.
They then swept demonstrators north
on Kearny to Commercial Street.

demonstration include: Dave Spector,
Charlie Field, Tom Fricke, Theresa
Ramirez, Joe Berman, Charlie Lyle.)

fire to an American flag. A young
secretary from the Bank of America
rushed into the plaza and put out the
flames.
Shortly thereafter, a group of
demonstrators left the plaza and moved
down California Street towards
Montgomery. They were followed by
mounted police, who were themselves
followed by another, larger group of
demonstrators who flowed into the
street.
A number of firecrackers exploded,
and random trashing of newspaper

stands and trash cans occurred. At
12:20 p.m. police began to clear the
California Street sidewalk, charging
demonstrators and lunching workers
alike. Traffic in the block between
Montgomery and Kearney was snarled,
by 12:25 p.m. when police made their
first arrest of the afternoon.
The mass of the demonstrators then
left the plaza, moving down California
and turning south onto Battery, where
the first major violence occured. As
police were trying to clear the street for
traffic, demonstrators downed five
minibikes.
To continue the traffic jam,
approximately 60 people sat down at
the intersection of Sansome and Bush.
Police, gunning their cars through the
area, immediately opened it.
At 1:15 p.m. the police declared it
an unlawful assembly. The policeman
also remarked, "We will disperse this
mob." Police drove people over a 10
foot drop at the Crown Zellerbach
Building and, extensively using clubs,
cleared the area at the base of Battery
Street.
Following the dispersal of the illegal
assembly on Bush, a number of
demonstrators regrouped in the Gianini
Plaza. In an effort to keeo the crowds
dispersed, police cleared demonstrators
off sidewalks on California up to Grant.
They then swept demonstrators north
on Kearny to Commercial Street.

demonstration include: Dave Spector,
Charlie Field, Tom Fricke, Theresa
Ramirez, Joe Berman, Charlie Lyle.)
An avowed attempt to shut down
operations in San Francisco's Financial
District was thwarted yesterday as city
police arrested 97 persons, keeping the
rest of the 1000 demonstrators
effectively disorganized throughout the
day.
Police used horses, minibikes,
motorcycles, and squad cars in an
effort to keep traffic moving and
businesses operating.
Despite their intentions to stop
normal business in the area, the
demonstrators posed only minor
inconveniences to financial district
workers.
Traffic ran almost normally, and no
buildings were blocked. Property
damage was slight.
The various activities of the day
were centered on two major targets, the
Bank of America headquarters on
Kearney Street and the Standard Oil
Building on Market Street.
The morning activities were
nondisruptive throughout. Although
many downtown garages reported
parking substantially down from
normal, planned stall-ins never
materialized. Demonstrators distributed
copies of the Peoples' Peace Treaty at
garages and street corners, across the
district. One group of Stanford
students picketed the Pacific Mutual
Building, which houses offices of the
Board of Trustees.

At the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange
on Sansome Street, demonstrators
talked with the leafletted personnel
before barred doors.
Guerilla theater groups performed in
front of the Bank of America Building
before a group of 80-100 people.
At 11 a.m. groups leafletting various
sections of the financial district met in
front of Standard Oil Company's
Market Street offices. Numbering about
400, they attempted to block Market
Street, but were confined to the
sidewalks by mounted police in riot
gear.
Forty minutes later the crowd left
Market Street, marching down Sutter
and Kearney Streets to the Bank of
America. Approximately 1000 people
filled Giannini Plaza in front of the
building for a noon rally and guerilla
theater dancing.
Shortly after noon, protestors set
fire to an American flag. A young
secretary from the Bank of America
rushed into the plaza and put out the
flames.
