# Ministers' Lives Emphasize Activism
## Hardegree Helps Workers 
### CHARLES FIELD Jr 
If you've been buying lunch at the Alternate Food
Service outside Tresidder Union lately, chances are good
that you get your sandwich and change from a red-bearded,
inconspicuously dressed minister.
He is Joe Hardegree of the United Campus Christian
Ministry (UCCM). He is also a self-proclaimed
revolutionary.
Hardegree may soon be jobless unless an appeal by
UCCM's local board halts a higher-level budget cut which
would eliminate one of two minister's positions at
Stanford. Hardegree "informally" understands his job will
be the one to go if the appeal fails.
The matter will be studied on May 16th when the
United Ministries In Higher Education, Northern California

regional parent of UCCM, will hold its annual meeting at
Stanford.
Specifically Targeted?
The cut seems to be specifically targeted for Stanford;
this "doesn't seem like coincidence" to Hardegree. "I'm the
first full-time, regular person to be laid off, while four
vacancies are being filled at other campuses."
A policy decision last summer by the regional group to
sell $10,000 in stocks and bonds to avoid cutting jobs
remains stalled, he adds.
The decision to slash Stanford's budgetal allowance by
$14,000 per year was taken after regional Executive
Director James Corson visited Stanford earlier this year on
a fact-finding mission.
The UCCM staff recently signed and sent a letter written
by Father .John Duryea deploring the possibility of
Hardegree's termination, and adding that, in their opinion,
Hardegree is an effective and important liason between the
campus ministry and students.
Crank Calls
In addition to facing the possibility of losing his job,
Hardegree is besieged by crank phone calls when his radical

activities hit the newspapers. He also occasionally faces the
direct intervention of university officials.
Former President Kenneth S. Pitzer once asked Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier to "keep Hardegree under
control," he says, following his involvement with the April
3 Movement. Napier indicates that Pitzer did "express to
me his unhappiness about Joe, and hoped I could do
something about it. I told him it wasn't any of my
business."
More recently, Acting Dean of Students Robert Freelen
told him that the Clubhouse, where the UCCM is quartered,
could not be used to prepare Alternate Food Service
sandwiches.
Call of Duty
Unconcerned by the difficulties, Hardegree sees his job
as "trying to help Christians becomes better Christians." "I
don't proselytize non-Christians," he says.
His work breaks down into three areas: "relating to and
contributing to the life of Christians on campus," working
with local churches and giving them campus opinions, and
doing "whatever my interest is on the scene."
In his self-defined call of duty, Hardegree shows up at
everything from communion services and Sunday school
classes to speeches before local churches about campus
problems and a Marxist-Christian dialogue group on
campus.
How do Marxism, Maoism and the ministry peacefully
coexist in Hardegree's philosophy? "There's a tension
between Marxist and Christian beliefs, but I think it's a
creative one. Christianity has been naive about society, has
tried to transpose one-to-one personal norms on social
situations. . . Marxism on the other hand doesn't deal
sufficiently with death, and sometimes reverses the
Christian error 1 mentioned," Hardegree reflects.
Armed Struggle
More specifically, he says,"The difference between
solutions to one-to-one and collective oppression is that
you have much more variety of choice on the individual
level. It's implicit in Christianity that you don't worship
the state."
"But, as Marx notes," Hardegree continues, "history
shows that in overthrowing reactionary state power, armed
struggle is eventually called for. Those in power will use
'any means necessary', too."
As for Maoism, Hardegree is enthusiastic but slightly
cautious. "For Maoist China, I have nothing but the highest
regard. It's the most important social experiment in the
world today. Maybe my movement friends will
excommunicate me for this, but I think even China must be
watched, though it does seem to have a dynamic for critical
renewal built in. Any society needs more than one source
of inspiration or insight, alternate ways of perceiving."
Sit-In Catalytic
Hardegree, a supporter of the recent Med Center
demonstrations and a cashier for the Alternate Food
Service, notes "Workers on campus have been gathering
steam for the past two years. The sit-in was a catalytic
action, as vanguard actions should be. It brought issues and
grievances into the open, though not a quick or easy
victory."
Citing the Tresidder boycott's successes, he proudly
declares it has raised over $1000 for laid-off workers.
Of students he says, "Black students, now threatened by
budget cuts, t.re on the move again." The white Stanford
student community "perplexes" him.
How does Hardegree face the prospect of
unemployment? "I can't take a pig capitalist job ... I
would try to find a good proletarian job. That is, if the FBI
wouldn't try to stop me. They have a thick file on me, and
corporations interested in preventing radical infiltration are
checking FBI files."

UCCM's local board halts a higher-level budget cut which
would eliminate one of two minister's positions at
Stanford. Hardegree "informally" understands his job will
be the one to go if the appeal fails.
The matter will be studied on May 16th when the
United Ministries In Higher Education, Northern California

regional parent of UCCM, will hold its annual meeting at
Stanford.
Specifically Targeted?
The cut seems to be specifically targeted for Stanford;
this "doesn't seem like coincidence" to Hardegree. "I'm the
first full-time, regular person to be laid off, while four
vacancies are being filled at other campuses."
A policy decision last summer by the regional group to
sell $10,000 in stocks and bonds to avoid cutting jobs
remains stalled, he adds.
The decision to slash Stanford's budgetal allowance by
$14,000 per year was taken after regional Executive
Director James Corson visited Stanford earlier this year on
a fact-finding mission.
The UCCM staff recently signed and sent a letter written
by Father .John Duryea deploring the possibility of
Hardegree's termination, and adding that, in their opinion,
Hardegree is an effective and important liason between the
campus ministry and students.
Crank Calls
In addition to facing the possibility of losing his job,
Hardegree is besieged by crank phone calls when his radical

activities hit the newspapers. He also occasionally faces the
direct intervention of university officials.
Former President Kenneth S. Pitzer once asked Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier to "keep Hardegree under
control," he says, following his involvement with the April
3 Movement. Napier indicates that Pitzer did "express to
me his unhappiness about Joe, and hoped I could do
something about it. I told him it wasn't any of my
business."
More recently, Acting Dean of Students Robert Freelen
told him that the Clubhouse, where the UCCM is quartered,
could not be used to prepare Alternate Food Service
sandwiches.
Call of Duty
Unconcerned by the difficulties, Hardegree sees his job
as "trying to help Christians becomes better Christians." "I
don't proselytize non-Christians," he says.
His work breaks down into three areas: "relating to and
contributing to the life of Christians on campus," working
with local churches and giving them campus opinions, and
doing "whatever my interest is on the scene."
In his self-defined call of duty, Hardegree shows up at
everything from communion services and Sunday school
classes to speeches before local churches about campus
problems and a Marxist-Christian dialogue group on
campus.
How do Marxism, Maoism and the ministry peacefully
coexist in Hardegree's philosophy? "There's a tension
between Marxist and Christian beliefs, but I think it's a
creative one. Christianity has been naive about society, has
tried to transpose one-to-one personal norms on social
situations. . . Marxism on the other hand doesn't deal
sufficiently with death, and sometimes reverses the
Christian error 1 mentioned," Hardegree reflects.
Armed Struggle
More specifically, he says,"The difference between
solutions to one-to-one and collective oppression is that
you have much more variety of choice on the individual
level. It's implicit in Christianity that you don't worship
the state."
"But, as Marx notes," Hardegree continues, "history
shows that in overthrowing reactionary state power, armed
struggle is eventually called for. Those in power will use
'any means necessary', too."
As for Maoism, Hardegree is enthusiastic but slightly
cautious. "For Maoist China, I have nothing but the highest
regard. It's the most important social experiment in the
world today. Maybe my movement friends will
excommunicate me for this, but I think even China must be
watched, though it does seem to have a dynamic for critical
renewal built in. Any society needs more than one source
of inspiration or insight, alternate ways of perceiving."
Sit-In Catalytic
Hardegree, a supporter of the recent Med Center
demonstrations and a cashier for the Alternate Food
Service, notes "Workers on campus have been gathering
steam for the past two years. The sit-in was a catalytic
action, as vanguard actions should be. It brought issues and
grievances into the open, though not a quick or easy
victory."
Citing the Tresidder boycott's successes, he proudly
declares it has raised over $1000 for laid-off workers.
Of students he says, "Black students, now threatened by
budget cuts, t.re on the move again." The white Stanford
student community "perplexes" him.
How does Hardegree face the prospect of
unemployment? "I can't take a pig capitalist job ... I
would try to find a good proletarian job. That is, if the FBI
wouldn't try to stop me. They have a thick file on me, and
corporations interested in preventing radical infiltration are
checking FBI files."

The cut seems to be specifically targeted for Stanford;
this "doesn't seem like coincidence" to Hardegree. "I'm the
first full-time, regular person to be laid off, while four
vacancies are being filled at other campuses."
A policy decision last summer by the regional group to
sell $10,000 in stocks and bonds to avoid cutting jobs
remains stalled, he adds.
The decision to slash Stanford's budgetal allowance by
$14,000 per year was taken after regional Executive
Director James Corson visited Stanford earlier this year on
a fact-finding mission.
The UCCM staff recently signed and sent a letter written
by Father .John Duryea deploring the possibility of
Hardegree's termination, and adding that, in their opinion,
Hardegree is an effective and important liason between the
campus ministry and students.
Crank Calls
In addition to facing the possibility of losing his job,
Hardegree is besieged by crank phone calls when his radical

activities hit the newspapers. He also occasionally faces the
direct intervention of university officials.
Former President Kenneth S. Pitzer once asked Dean of
the Chapel B. Davie Napier to "keep Hardegree under
control," he says, following his involvement with the April
3 Movement. Napier indicates that Pitzer did "express to
me his unhappiness about Joe, and hoped I could do
something about it. I told him it wasn't any of my
business."
More recently, Acting Dean of Students Robert Freelen
told him that the Clubhouse, where the UCCM is quartered,
could not be used to prepare Alternate Food Service
sandwiches.
Call of Duty
Unconcerned by the difficulties, Hardegree sees his job
as "trying to help Christians becomes better Christians." "I
don't proselytize non-Christians," he says.
His work breaks down into three areas: "relating to and
contributing to the life of Christians on campus," working
with local churches and giving them campus opinions, and
doing "whatever my interest is on the scene."
In his self-defined call of duty, Hardegree shows up at
everything from communion services and Sunday school
classes to speeches before local churches about campus
problems and a Marxist-Christian dialogue group on
campus.
How do Marxism, Maoism and the ministry peacefully
coexist in Hardegree's philosophy? "There's a tension
between Marxist and Christian beliefs, but I think it's a
creative one. Christianity has been naive about society, has
tried to transpose one-to-one personal norms on social
situations. . . Marxism on the other hand doesn't deal
sufficiently with death, and sometimes reverses the
Christian error 1 mentioned," Hardegree reflects.
Armed Struggle
More specifically, he says,"The difference between
solutions to one-to-one and collective oppression is that
you have much more variety of choice on the individual
level. It's implicit in Christianity that you don't worship
the state."
"But, as Marx notes," Hardegree continues, "history
shows that in overthrowing reactionary state power, armed
struggle is eventually called for. Those in power will use
'any means necessary', too."
As for Maoism, Hardegree is enthusiastic but slightly
cautious. "For Maoist China, I have nothing but the highest
regard. It's the most important social experiment in the
world today. Maybe my movement friends will
excommunicate me for this, but I think even China must be
watched, though it does seem to have a dynamic for critical
renewal built in. Any society needs more than one source
of inspiration or insight, alternate ways of perceiving."
Sit-In Catalytic
Hardegree, a supporter of the recent Med Center
demonstrations and a cashier for the Alternate Food
Service, notes "Workers on campus have been gathering
steam for the past two years. The sit-in was a catalytic
action, as vanguard actions should be. It brought issues and
grievances into the open, though not a quick or easy
victory."
Citing the Tresidder boycott's successes, he proudly
declares it has raised over $1000 for laid-off workers.
Of students he says, "Black students, now threatened by
budget cuts, t.re on the move again." The white Stanford
student community "perplexes" him.
How does Hardegree face the prospect of
unemployment? "I can't take a pig capitalist job ... I
would try to find a good proletarian job. That is, if the FBI
wouldn't try to stop me. They have a thick file on me, and
corporations interested in preventing radical infiltration are
checking FBI files."
