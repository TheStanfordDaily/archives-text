# Brown Blocks Board
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Robert McAfee Brown is an ex-convict who thinks he may someday return to
Santa Rita Prison.
But the religion professor is far from your typical hardened criminal. Dr.
Brown agrees with the prisoner who told him his five-day sentence was more a
"visit" than "serving time." And the "crime" which "may lead us back to Santa
Rita" is civil disobedience to protest the Vietnam War.
Brown was one of 10 demonstrators, mostly students, who Tuesday morning
finished five-day terms for a Good Friday blockade of the Berkeley draft board
office. Seven other protestors served their sentences two weeks ago; and Brown
stresses he was part of a team. "
Gesturing and speaking with his usual intensity, Brown described the "little
inkling" he gained, of prison life, where a man is "reduced to an object" with no
control over his life. As a middle-class American, he said he learned "more clearly
the price other people must pay for my relative comfort."
He agrees with draft-resister David Harris that the crimes of Santa Rita
prisoners must be compared to the "enormous" war crimes of national leaders. He
thinks the nation must learn "how to handle" the disparities.
Brown's group of protesters faced few conflicts in prison. During their brief
stay, the ten were allowed to stay together and were never moved from the
"receiving barracks" to the rougher routine of regular prison facilities. Assistant
Dean of Students Bill Leland and Brown's son, Peter, were not so lucky two
weeks before. They were the only whites in an all-black barracks, and Peter
received a black eye while watching what Leland called "a small riot."
All of the protesters chose a jail sentence over an alternative $50 fine because
paying the cash "would be to accept a privilege other people don't have," Brown
explained. As a minister, he also voiced the religious belief that "love is only real
as it can increasingly identify with the object of concern." He said this requires
sharing "the grief of others" by enduring necessary suffering.
Tactically, Brown thinks the jail term added to the "impact" of the draft board
blockade, proving it was not a "quixotic" effort. He said a series of draft board
actions by staid professors and clergymen may move some "middle-class people to
be a little more sensitized" when they see "a square like Brown is doing something
not quite in the orbit of what square usually means."
However, he also concedes the need for "creative" new approaches to
non-violent protest. Brown said his prison visit helped him understand why
minorities are moved to violence. But he added, "I still feel that the role I want to
play is to try to work non-violently without saying I must impose that view on
everybody."
Brown and the other Santa Rita veterans wiil meet soon to discuss both prison
reform and future anti-war protests. They have no "agenda that next week there
will be Act X," Brown said, but they will turn to civil disobedience when "there's
an act you can do more powerfully than speaking."
And that may eventually mean another Santa Rita "visit" for Ex-con Brown
and his teammates.

inkling" he gained, of prison life, where a man is "reduced to an object" with no
control over his life. As a middle-class American, he said he learned "more clearly
the price other people must pay for my relative comfort."
He agrees with draft-resister David Harris that the crimes of Santa Rita
prisoners must be compared to the "enormous" war crimes of national leaders. He
thinks the nation must learn "how to handle" the disparities.
Brown's group of protesters faced few conflicts in prison. During their brief
stay, the ten were allowed to stay together and were never moved from the
"receiving barracks" to the rougher routine of regular prison facilities. Assistant
Dean of Students Bill Leland and Brown's son, Peter, were not so lucky two
weeks before. They were the only whites in an all-black barracks, and Peter
received a black eye while watching what Leland called "a small riot."
All of the protesters chose a jail sentence over an alternative $50 fine because
paying the cash "would be to accept a privilege other people don't have," Brown
explained. As a minister, he also voiced the religious belief that "love is only real
as it can increasingly identify with the object of concern." He said this requires
sharing "the grief of others" by enduring necessary suffering.
Tactically, Brown thinks the jail term added to the "impact" of the draft board
blockade, proving it was not a "quixotic" effort. He said a series of draft board
actions by staid professors and clergymen may move some "middle-class people to
be a little more sensitized" when they see "a square like Brown is doing something
not quite in the orbit of what square usually means."
However, he also concedes the need for "creative" new approaches to
non-violent protest. Brown said his prison visit helped him understand why
minorities are moved to violence. But he added, "I still feel that the role I want to
play is to try to work non-violently without saying I must impose that view on
everybody."
Brown and the other Santa Rita veterans wiil meet soon to discuss both prison
reform and future anti-war protests. They have no "agenda that next week there
will be Act X," Brown said, but they will turn to civil disobedience when "there's
an act you can do more powerfully than speaking."
And that may eventually mean another Santa Rita "visit" for Ex-con Brown
and his teammates.

CLOSED DOOR POLlCY—Robert McAfee Brown, professor of religion is here
seen blocking the entrance to a San Mateo draft board. Brown was later given a
five day sentence for a similar blockade in Berkeley.
Robert McAfee Brown is an ex-convict who thinks he may someday return to
Santa Rita Prison.
But the religion professor is far from your typical hardened criminal. Dr.
Brown agrees with the prisoner who told him his five-day sentence was more a
"visit" than "serving time." And the "crime" which "may lead us back to Santa
Rita" is civil disobedience to protest the Vietnam War.
Brown was one of 10 demonstrators, mostly students, who Tuesday morning
finished five-day terms for a Good Friday blockade of the Berkeley draft board
office. Seven other protestors served their sentences two weeks ago; and Brown
stresses he was part of a team. "
Gesturing and speaking with his usual intensity, Brown described the "little
inkling" he gained, of prison life, where a man is "reduced to an object" with no
control over his life. As a middle-class American, he said he learned "more clearly
the price other people must pay for my relative comfort."
