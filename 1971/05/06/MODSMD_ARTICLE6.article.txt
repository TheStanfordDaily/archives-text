Editor, THE DAILY:
I don't wish to impute bad
faith to the reporter who wrote
me up last Friday, but 1 do wish
to assert that the result distorts
what I am and what I believe.
First, I am not a revolutionary.
I could have told the reporter, if
he asked, that the literature lying
about the room is not all mine;
people have simply stored it there.
Secondly, I do not consider the
violence/non-violence issue to be
"simply tactical, not moral." I
can't recall what phrases were put
together to make the patch-work
quotation which opened the
article, but the result is certainly
not my belief.
I believe that every decision
(including tactical ones) is moral,
and the decision to use violence
can be justified only under very
rare circumstances, if ever.
Third, my brother's reception
of communion at Memorial
Church (which, by the way, I did
not witness) was no act of
defiance. If he had come to me
for it, I should have given it to

him, as tx> anyone else, in simple
recognition of the freedom of
another man's conscience.
Fourth, "Pop" is not my usual
appellation, by girls or anyone
else. I trust that I have achieved
better rapport than such a silly
name would imply.
I should not have troubled to
correct impressions, if it were not
for the fact that the atmosphere
of violence at Stanford during the
last few weeks is abhorrent to me,
and 1 do not wish to be given the
appearance of approving it.
Father John S. Duryea
cop-out
Editor, THE DAILY:
Though some of the Black
demands were reasonable, 1
thought most were excessive.
Since I'm white, I'm told that I
have no way of knowing the Black
consciousness, which may be true
but seems to be a cop out—a lack
of communication at least, and
perhaps merely a justification for
the Black self-righteousness (a
wall to work behind). I've read

Leroi Jones and find in him the
seed of this clandestine trend.
But I would assume that there
is disunity among the Blacks just
as there is a lack of common
pursuit among any other race or
nation. Does the Third world
include Sidney Poitier and Ciana
Ross? The distinct division
between whites and people of
color doesn't work for me. It ain't
that simple. I don't feel akin to
whites, not all whites, not in the
same intensity that BSU seems to
think Blacks are united.
I do, however, see the thread
of human-ness through all races.
Some of the greatest (and I'm
forced to use the adjective) white
men were at the same time the
most alienated from others,
probably more so than any Black.
Neither is oppression or
discrimination limited to Blacks
But the BSU, in their demands for
more than equal rights (nine unit
requirement for Black freshmen)
intensifies the feeling of
estrangement from those of whom
the demands are made, and
doesn't add dignity to the
cause—this making mutual respect
more difficult; and in order to
make affective change we must
meet on equal terms, rather than
dividing into closely knit factions.
Let's use the April 24 Peace
March as a lesson.

another man's conscience.
Fourth, "Pop" is not my usual
appellation, by girls or anyone
else. I trust that I have achieved
better rapport than such a silly
name would imply.
I should not have troubled to
correct impressions, if it were not
for the fact that the atmosphere
of violence at Stanford during the
last few weeks is abhorrent to me,
and 1 do not wish to be given the
appearance of approving it.

Though some of the Black
demands were reasonable, 1
thought most were excessive.
Since I'm white, I'm told that I
have no way of knowing the Black
consciousness, which may be true
but seems to be a cop out—a lack
of communication at least, and
perhaps merely a justification for
the Black self-righteousness (a
wall to work behind). I've read

Leroi Jones and find in him the
seed of this clandestine trend.
But I would assume that there
is disunity among the Blacks just
as there is a lack of common
pursuit among any other race or
nation. Does the Third world
include Sidney Poitier and Ciana
Ross? The distinct division
between whites and people of
color doesn't work for me. It ain't
that simple. I don't feel akin to
whites, not all whites, not in the
same intensity that BSU seems to
think Blacks are united.
I do, however, see the thread
of human-ness through all races.
Some of the greatest (and I'm
forced to use the adjective) white
men were at the same time the
most alienated from others,
probably more so than any Black.
Neither is oppression or
discrimination limited to Blacks
But the BSU, in their demands for
more than equal rights (nine unit
requirement for Black freshmen)
intensifies the feeling of
estrangement from those of whom
the demands are made, and
doesn't add dignity to the
cause—this making mutual respect
more difficult; and in order to
make affective change we must
meet on equal terms, rather than
dividing into closely knit factions.
Let's use the April 24 Peace
March as a lesson.

I don't wish to impute bad
faith to the reporter who wrote
me up last Friday, but 1 do wish
to assert that the result distorts
what I am and what I believe.
First, I am not a revolutionary.
I could have told the reporter, if
he asked, that the literature lying
about the room is not all mine;
people have simply stored it there.
Secondly, I do not consider the
violence/non-violence issue to be
"simply tactical, not moral." I
can't recall what phrases were put
together to make the patch-work
quotation which opened the
article, but the result is certainly
not my belief.
I believe that every decision
(including tactical ones) is moral,
and the decision to use violence
can be justified only under very
rare circumstances, if ever.
Third, my brother's reception
of communion at Memorial
Church (which, by the way, I did
not witness) was no act of
defiance. If he had come to me
for it, I should have given it to

him, as tx> anyone else, in simple
recognition of the freedom of
another man's conscience.
