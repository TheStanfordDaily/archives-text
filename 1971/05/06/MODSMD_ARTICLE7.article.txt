## Nixon To Control II-S Deferments 
### 
Alan strain peter hanawalt

On April 23rd, 1970 President Nixon
requested executive power to control student
deferments. Congress failed to act on that
request, but it now seems certain that this
authority will be granted the President under
the 1971 legislation now being considered by
Congress.
What is not yet certain is how student
deferments will be ended. The House-approved
version of the new draft bill allows the
President to cancel 11-S classifications
retroactively to April 23,1970. The version of
the bill approved last week by the Senate
Armed Service Committee would only permit
the President to deny 11-S classifications to
men entering college after the law is enacted.
So college freshmen will continue to be
uncertain until the new law is passed, and an
Executive Order issued.
If you have been postponing requesting a
11-S deferment until your lottery drawing or
for other reasons, you should now seriously
consider requesting the deferment and having
Stanford certify students status. This would
help avoid mis-understandings with local
boards, and insure your right to a continuing
11-S if the Senate version of the bill is passed,
forbidding new 11-S classifications after July 1,
1971.
More Changes
Changes in student deferments other than
under-graduate 11-S are also planned. IV-D
divinity school deferments and 11-A
apprenticeship and trade school deferments
may be ended. Graduate school deferments
will probably remain available to students of
medicine and related specialities. The I-S(C)
college deferment (for the remainder of an
academic year after issuance of an induction
order) will most likely be changed to an

induction postponement, with no reopening of
classification and appeal rights. There is still
debate whether to continue to grant I-S(H)
high school deferments, or to change them to
induction postponements as with the I-S(C).
What lottery numbers will be called during
1971?
The Pentagon has projected that between
80,000 and 120,000 men will be drafted
during calendar year 1971. But men called for
the first 5 months already total 83,000. Draft
calls, then, should go down considerably in the
remaining months of the year, unless political
pressures for zero draft calls before November
1972 result in inflated calls during the latter
half of this year.
For the month of May, draft boards are
authorized to induct men with numbers
through 125, and pre-induction physicals are
authorized for numbers through 175. Last year
the highest number authorized for physicals
for the entire year (215) was set in March. This
number was 20 beyond the highest number
(195) reached for induction last year. The
highest lottery number authorized for
induction for the month of June, 1970, was
within 25 of the highest number reached for
the year. New draft legislation, foreign policy
decisions, and domestic politics may still
influence the ceiling for numbers called during
1971. But estimates from Selective Service and
other sources center within the range of 140 to
160.
Pressure Eased
We recently learned of changes being
contemplated in the administration of the
draft which could take much of the pressure
off both the individual and the Selective

Service System. The plan introduces a new,
non-appealable classification: I-H. Following
registration, all men would be placed in the
new class until after their lottery numbers are
determined. At the time of the annual lottery
drawing, an estimate of the highest number to
be reached during the following year would be
made. Those with lottery numbers above this
number would remain in I-H indefinitely.
These men would never have to fill out
classification questionaires, be given
pre-induction physicals, or otherwise be
processed for classification.
The advantages to Selective Service of such
a plan are obvious. The majority of registrants
in the forseeable future would not have to be
processed beyond registration, and the
majority of appeals would be eliminated. For
many individuals the paranoia which
accompanies the I-A classification would be
eliminated, thus removing one of the most
tangible pressures of the draft This might
prove to be a false sense of security, however,
since presumably one could still be reclassified
out of I-H and I-A if the President decided he
needed additional manpower.

version of the new draft bill allows the
President to cancel 11-S classifications
retroactively to April 23,1970. The version of
the bill approved last week by the Senate
Armed Service Committee would only permit
the President to deny 11-S classifications to
men entering college after the law is enacted.
So college freshmen will continue to be
uncertain until the new law is passed, and an
Executive Order issued.
If you have been postponing requesting a
11-S deferment until your lottery drawing or
for other reasons, you should now seriously
consider requesting the deferment and having
Stanford certify students status. This would
help avoid mis-understandings with local
boards, and insure your right to a continuing
11-S if the Senate version of the bill is passed,
forbidding new 11-S classifications after July 1,
1971.
More Changes
Changes in student deferments other than
under-graduate 11-S are also planned. IV-D
divinity school deferments and 11-A
apprenticeship and trade school deferments
may be ended. Graduate school deferments
will probably remain available to students of
medicine and related specialities. The I-S(C)
college deferment (for the remainder of an
academic year after issuance of an induction
order) will most likely be changed to an

induction postponement, with no reopening of
classification and appeal rights. There is still
debate whether to continue to grant I-S(H)
high school deferments, or to change them to
induction postponements as with the I-S(C).
What lottery numbers will be called during
1971?
The Pentagon has projected that between
80,000 and 120,000 men will be drafted
during calendar year 1971. But men called for
the first 5 months already total 83,000. Draft
calls, then, should go down considerably in the
remaining months of the year, unless political
pressures for zero draft calls before November
1972 result in inflated calls during the latter
half of this year.
For the month of May, draft boards are
authorized to induct men with numbers
through 125, and pre-induction physicals are
authorized for numbers through 175. Last year
the highest number authorized for physicals
for the entire year (215) was set in March. This
number was 20 beyond the highest number
(195) reached for induction last year. The
highest lottery number authorized for
induction for the month of June, 1970, was
within 25 of the highest number reached for
the year. New draft legislation, foreign policy
decisions, and domestic politics may still
influence the ceiling for numbers called during
1971. But estimates from Selective Service and
other sources center within the range of 140 to
160.
Pressure Eased
We recently learned of changes being
contemplated in the administration of the
draft which could take much of the pressure
off both the individual and the Selective

Service System. The plan introduces a new,
non-appealable classification: I-H. Following
registration, all men would be placed in the
new class until after their lottery numbers are
determined. At the time of the annual lottery
drawing, an estimate of the highest number to
be reached during the following year would be
made. Those with lottery numbers above this
number would remain in I-H indefinitely.
These men would never have to fill out
classification questionaires, be given
pre-induction physicals, or otherwise be
processed for classification.
The advantages to Selective Service of such
a plan are obvious. The majority of registrants
in the forseeable future would not have to be
processed beyond registration, and the
majority of appeals would be eliminated. For
many individuals the paranoia which
accompanies the I-A classification would be
eliminated, thus removing one of the most
tangible pressures of the draft This might
prove to be a false sense of security, however,
since presumably one could still be reclassified
out of I-H and I-A if the President decided he
needed additional manpower.

On April 23rd, 1970 President Nixon
requested executive power to control student
deferments. Congress failed to act on that
request, but it now seems certain that this
authority will be granted the President under
the 1971 legislation now being considered by
Congress.
What is not yet certain is how student
deferments will be ended. The House-approved
version of the new draft bill allows the
