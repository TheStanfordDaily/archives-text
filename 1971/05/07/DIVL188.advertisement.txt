Today In The 'Daily'
This is May 7, 1971 — one of those days which should make you proud to
be an American.
Fifty-three years ago, the Lusitania went down, and an outraged
American public prepared for the war that was to make the world safe for
democracy.
Then, in 1945, we celebrated the end of the yet another war to end all
1 wars. It was Victory in Europe — the victory in Asia was a little longer
coming.
Seventeen years ago, French forces surrendered to the Viet Minh at
Dienbienphu. That was supposed to be the end of that war.
Eleven years ago, the U.S. Government decided to admit that Gary
Powers was not just sightseeing over the USSR while taking a spin in his U-2.
And there went the summit conference designed to take the chill off the
Cold War.
To top it all off, in 1965, a mistrial was declared in the case of Collie
Wilkins, accused of murdering Viola Liuzzo, a civil rights worker in Alabama.
It just goes to show how noble and fair is that system of American justice
that we fought for on all those fronts.
Oh, well, if you want to renounce your citizenship, let the news desk

Just to top it all off, Pat McMahon returns to campus today for an
