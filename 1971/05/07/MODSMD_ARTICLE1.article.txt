# Okay, Let's Fight About It
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Every Wednesday night at 8:00,
Studio A of KZSU goes "black." A new
program begun this quarter comes on
the air, entirely produced, engineered
and edited by a group of blacks, to give
their point of view and analysis of
current events.
"There is an American hypocrisy"
towards blacks, says Johnie Scott,
leader of an Afro-American studies
class that produces the show. "This
show, if it has one function, is to point
this out. This is why we call it 'Let's
Fight About It.' Silence is a sign of
agreement."
Let's Fight About It also fulfills the
"responsibility of the black
intellectual" to deal with "the need for
an ideology," in Scott's words.
Leo Bazile, who also appears on
each show, says it is important to
dissect "some of these black
people . . . Malcolm and Nkrumah. And
the job of dissecting falls on black
people."
He also thinks that since there are "a
whole lot of black brothers over all the
world .. . you can't be interested in
Mississippi if you don't know what's
going on in the Congo."
Although there are a couple of radio
stations in the Bay Area which program
for black audiences, Scott says, "this
kind of thing we're doing isn't being
done. This is an experiment. This is an
ambitious thing."
To explain why a show with such a
political foramwork is important, he
points out that only 180 radio stations
in the U.S. devote over ten hours a day
to black programming. Of 64 which do
this full-time, only 13 are owned by
blacks. To compound the problem,
their time is nearly filled with "Rythm
and Blues," while little space is left
over for news and politics from a black
perspective.
A Message
The program begins with music by
Donnie Hathaway, Oscar Brown or
another artist who has "a message" in
his song. Then a member of the class
gives a summary of what he has been
researching, such as drug abuse in East
Palo Alto or the split in the Black

Panther party, before Bazile and Scott
start a discussion between themselves,
almost as though there were no
listeners tuned in on their show.
The occasional guest on the show
may include for example, a man from
East Palo Alto, recently returned from
the San Quentin and Soledad prisons.
The show moves on in a relaxed way,
with the two principal members never
quite coming to a disagreement.
The show is needed, says Harold
Hudson who appeared in the latest one,
because "blacks seem to be more
political. There is no program that
speaks to you besides James Brown and
the Temptations. Not all blacks can
sing, or play football and basketball."
Trying to "objectively research
material" presented in the press is an
important part of the show, according
to Cleveland Smith. "It is the only
worthwhile show that gives the listener
insight into current issues from a black
perspective."
In trying to obtain statistics on
heroin addicts in East Palo Alto, Smith
claims that it was often not possible to
get them from police departments in
the area.
The show took heroin addiction as
an example of a black problem which
only becomes important when it
spreads to whites. Commented Bazile,
"It is as blatant a form of racism to
withold this information on black
addicts, as it is to dwell upon the ills of
the white community."
Occasional abuse is also aimed
towards those whites who purport to
be aiding groups like the Black
Panthers. Bazile accuses them of
"pitching pennies" (fund-raising) while
the Panthers were fighting by
themselves. Another member admits he
is leary of the "revolutionary rap about
my black brother."
Black Ecology
"Black ecology," which refers to the
living conditions of blacks in crowded
cities, is another example of what is
seen as a distinction between black and
white problems. Says Curtis Jones,
"Recycling has nothing to do with the
garbage that's still piled up in Harlem."
It is hard to pin down what specific

message, if any, the show has. "The
purpose of the show is to educate
blacks to black happenings," in Jones'
opinion. "The education of whites is a
by-product... A revolutionary has to
be out educating the people about what
he's going to do."
Another adds, "Stanford black
people are the cream of the crop. The
people on the other side of the freeway
are dependent on us."
However, it is also obvious who
listens to the show for the most part.
"We don't kid ourselves," says Scott.
"Stanford is still a white private
university, and the show is obviously
heard by a white audience ...
"One of the real concerns is
language. I don't want to have only
people from Stanford who understand.
I'd be afraid to think what someone in
EPA (East Palo Alto) would say if we
got too intellectual."
Possibilities for future shows are a
look at black capitalism, the difficulties
of black police officers, and the welfare
system.

in the U.S. devote over ten hours a day
to black programming. Of 64 which do
this full-time, only 13 are owned by
blacks. To compound the problem,
their time is nearly filled with "Rythm
and Blues," while little space is left
over for news and politics from a black
perspective.
A Message
The program begins with music by
Donnie Hathaway, Oscar Brown or
another artist who has "a message" in
his song. Then a member of the class
gives a summary of what he has been
researching, such as drug abuse in East
Palo Alto or the split in the Black

Panther party, before Bazile and Scott
start a discussion between themselves,
almost as though there were no
listeners tuned in on their show.
The occasional guest on the show
may include for example, a man from
East Palo Alto, recently returned from
the San Quentin and Soledad prisons.
The show moves on in a relaxed way,
with the two principal members never
quite coming to a disagreement.
The show is needed, says Harold
Hudson who appeared in the latest one,
because "blacks seem to be more
political. There is no program that
speaks to you besides James Brown and
the Temptations. Not all blacks can
sing, or play football and basketball."
Trying to "objectively research
material" presented in the press is an
important part of the show, according
to Cleveland Smith. "It is the only
worthwhile show that gives the listener
insight into current issues from a black
perspective."
In trying to obtain statistics on
heroin addicts in East Palo Alto, Smith
claims that it was often not possible to
get them from police departments in
the area.
The show took heroin addiction as
an example of a black problem which
only becomes important when it
spreads to whites. Commented Bazile,
"It is as blatant a form of racism to
withold this information on black
addicts, as it is to dwell upon the ills of
the white community."
Occasional abuse is also aimed
towards those whites who purport to
be aiding groups like the Black
Panthers. Bazile accuses them of
"pitching pennies" (fund-raising) while
the Panthers were fighting by
themselves. Another member admits he
is leary of the "revolutionary rap about
my black brother."
Black Ecology
"Black ecology," which refers to the
living conditions of blacks in crowded
cities, is another example of what is
seen as a distinction between black and
white problems. Says Curtis Jones,
"Recycling has nothing to do with the
garbage that's still piled up in Harlem."
It is hard to pin down what specific

message, if any, the show has. "The
purpose of the show is to educate
blacks to black happenings," in Jones'
opinion. "The education of whites is a
by-product... A revolutionary has to
be out educating the people about what
he's going to do."
Another adds, "Stanford black
people are the cream of the crop. The
people on the other side of the freeway
are dependent on us."
However, it is also obvious who
listens to the show for the most part.
"We don't kid ourselves," says Scott.
"Stanford is still a white private
university, and the show is obviously
heard by a white audience ...
"One of the real concerns is
language. I don't want to have only
people from Stanford who understand.
I'd be afraid to think what someone in
EPA (East Palo Alto) would say if we
got too intellectual."
Possibilities for future shows are a
look at black capitalism, the difficulties
of black police officers, and the welfare
system.
Every Wednesday night at 8:00,
Studio A of KZSU goes "black." A new
program begun this quarter comes on
the air, entirely produced, engineered
and edited by a group of blacks, to give
their point of view and analysis of
current events.
"There is an American hypocrisy"
towards blacks, says Johnie Scott,
leader of an Afro-American studies
class that produces the show. "This
show, if it has one function, is to point
this out. This is why we call it 'Let's
Fight About It.' Silence is a sign of
agreement."
Let's Fight About It also fulfills the
"responsibility of the black
intellectual" to deal with "the need for
an ideology," in Scott's words.
Leo Bazile, who also appears on
each show, says it is important to
dissect "some of these black
people . . . Malcolm and Nkrumah. And
the job of dissecting falls on black
people."
He also thinks that since there are "a
whole lot of black brothers over all the
world .. . you can't be interested in
Mississippi if you don't know what's
going on in the Congo."
Although there are a couple of radio
stations in the Bay Area which program
for black audiences, Scott says, "this
kind of thing we're doing isn't being
done. This is an experiment. This is an
ambitious thing."

heroin addicts in East Palo Alto, Smith
claims that it was often not possible to
get them from police departments in
the area.
The show took heroin addiction as
an example of a black problem which
only becomes important when it
spreads to whites. Commented Bazile,
"It is as blatant a form of racism to
withold this information on black
addicts, as it is to dwell upon the ills of
the white community."
Occasional abuse is also aimed
towards those whites who purport to
be aiding groups like the Black
Panthers. Bazile accuses them of
"pitching pennies" (fund-raising) while
the Panthers were fighting by
themselves. Another member admits he
is leary of the "revolutionary rap about
my black brother."
Black Ecology
"Black ecology," which refers to the
living conditions of blacks in crowded
cities, is another example of what is
seen as a distinction between black and
white problems. Says Curtis Jones,
"Recycling has nothing to do with the
garbage that's still piled up in Harlem."
It is hard to pin down what specific

message, if any, the show has. "The
purpose of the show is to educate
blacks to black happenings," in Jones'
opinion. "The education of whites is a
by-product... A revolutionary has to
be out educating the people about what
he's going to do."
Another adds, "Stanford black
people are the cream of the crop. The
people on the other side of the freeway
are dependent on us."
However, it is also obvious who
listens to the show for the most part.
"We don't kid ourselves," says Scott.
"Stanford is still a white private
university, and the show is obviously
heard by a white audience ...
"One of the real concerns is
language. I don't want to have only
people from Stanford who understand.
I'd be afraid to think what someone in
EPA (East Palo Alto) would say if we
got too intellectual."
Possibilities for future shows are a
look at black capitalism, the difficulties
of black police officers, and the welfare
system.
