# Dated 'Miss Julie' Hits Class System
## 
### STU ALLEN 
August Strindberg wrote that
"questions of social climbing, of
falling, of higher or lower, better
or worse, of man and woman, are,
have been, and will be of lasting
interest."
In substance he is certainly
correct, but the way he deals with
this problem in his play, "Miss
Julie," is incongrous to a modern
audience. The play concerns a
man, trying to better his station in
life, being held back by his
immutably subservient
personality; and a woman, seeking
the faith and joy of commoners
stolen from her by her noble
family.
The problem of social class is
certainly still with us: indeed, it
surrounds us. The subject of
sexual virtue, however, has lost
much of its impact.
We can no longer feel pity for a
"fallen" women to the degree that
Strindberg envisioned in 1888.
How to play this role convincingly
to an audience in 1971 is one of
the major problems that faces
Reba Waters Thomas. Thankfully
she meets it head on, not muffling
her role at all. "Miss Julie" is in a
sense a dated play, but a
fascinating one.
After all, "Hamlet" is no less
enthralling because we have
stopped fighting for crowns and
castles per se. The thought of
"modernizing" Miss Julie brings
to mind ACT's "Merchant of
Venice" displaying a topless
Jessica.
Instead of such gobbledygook,
Miss Thomas has explored the
inner recesses of Miss Julie's
personality, and thus is not
limited to the increasingly moot
dilemma of extra-marital sex.
The interplay of all three
characters is thoroughly
contemporary in its intricacy.
Even if one cannot follow the
psychological thread of speech
line by line, the characters
generally make sense. That is to
say that they are elusive, but not
to the point of obscurity and
boredom.
Jean, for example, seems to
have an unduly rough and uneven
temperament at the outset, and
one wonders why Bob Bates chose

this mode. The reason (see for
yourself) becomes clear as the
drama follows through. The acting
is not only consistent (a feat in
itself for this work), it is
consistently incisive and
penetrating.
The shreiking verbal clashes are
offset by the low-keyed humor
introduced by Bridget Ross as
Kristin. No description would do
justice to the scene in which she
stands calmly opposite a ranting
Miss Julie.
The Cyclic pace set by the
director Margaret Booker, runs
true to Strindberg's play so that
the cast does not run out of steam
even at the play's end. One wishes
they would go on, but Strindberg
has decided that enough is
enough.
Miss Julie is playing tonight
