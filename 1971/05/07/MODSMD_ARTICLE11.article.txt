# S.F. Ballet Entertains
## 
### PEGGY SONNENSCHEIN 
Anyone who ever sat
wide-eyed through "The
Nutcracker" as a child will
thoroughly enjoy the San
Francisco Ballet Company's
current production of
Tchaikovsky's "Beauty and the
Beast," which opened Saturday
night at the Opera House.
Although not a particularly
"heavy" evening, which may be
somewhat disappointing to true
ballet buffs, it is certainly
entertaining, and the lead dancers
could not have been better.
This delightful fantasy was
brought to life by the outstanding
performances of Lynda Meyer as
Beauty and Matti Tikkanen as the
Beast. Meyer is an extremely
gifted dancer, poised and graceful.
Her body, spirit, and facial
expression were in perfect
harmony, evoking the true image
of a prima ballerina.
Unfortunately, the incidental
dances were characterized by ups
and downs (literally as well as
figuratively): some
finely-executed leaps and turns as
well as a few noticeable errors in
timing. However, these were more
than made up for by the brilliant
dancing of the leads.

Kerry Williams and Phillipe
Arrona turned in a fine
performance in the Roses Waltz.
However, the highlight of the
evening was the Wedding Day Pas
de Deux. The contrast between
the swift graceful turns of Beauty
and the controlled power of the
Beast was truly exciting.
Complementing the lyrical
spell cast by the dancers were the
creative and attractive costumes
and sets of Tony Duquette. The
forest scene, with butterflies,
orioles, stags, and fireflies flitting
across the stage, was especiall;
captivating. The lighting, too, was
well done, especially in such
contrasts as the dark mystic forest
and the brilliant splendor of the
palace.
Preceding the two-act ballet
was a light quick Pas de Six, set to
music of Hans Christian Lumbye.
The exuberant spirit of the three
couples got the evening off to a
fine start.
"Beauty and the Beast" will be
paired with "Le Corsaire" on May
9. On May 15 and May 16 it will
be presented with "La Source."
For those who prefer "deeper"
ballet, the company will be
opening their season at the Palace
of Fine Arts Theatre on May 12,
and will run through May 28.
