During Fall and Winter Quarters 1970-71, the Stanford
Judicial Council and the Dean of Students considered
charges brought against thirty-two students in connec
tion with thirteen incidents involving alleged violations
of University regulations. Nine of these incidents led to
charges brought by the University Administration, while
the remaining incidents resulted in charges brought by
students, faculty, or staff.
As of the close of Winter Quarter, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Dean of Students had held hearings and
made recommendations on all matters pending before
them, with the exception of the charges against two
individuals. Hearings on these latter two cases were
scheduled for late April.
Cases Brought by the University Administration
1. April 29, 1970, Rock Throwing. Prior to the close
of the Spring Quarter of 1970, one student was
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for inten
tionally throwing rocks at the Old Union. This
case was put over to the Fall Quarter. At a hearing
in November of 1970, the SJC sustained these
charges and recommended that a "hold" be placed
on this student's registration for a period of three
years. This recommendation was approved by the
President.
2. May 1, 1970, Disruption of a Class in Electrical
Engineering. During the Fall Quarter of 1970-71,
seven students were charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident.
Two of these students stipulated the facts and
requested the Dean of Students to hear their cases.
After a hearing held in November 1970, the SJC
decided that the class had been disrupted by a
number of individuals who, though not registered
in this course, entered the classroom, insisted that
the class discuss the "Cambodian Situation" and
were "unwilling to permit the class to proceed as a
normal class." Three of the four students were
found not to have actively participated in the
disruption and were therefore not in violation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption;one student was
found to have been an active participant. The SJC
found that there were mitigating circumstances
and recommended that the latter student be
suspended for one quarter, with the suspension to
be stayed during good behavior. These recommen
dations were approved by the President. The two
students who had elected to have their cases heard
by the Dean of Students were also not active
participants in the disruption, and, consequently,
on the basis of the SJC's decision, the charges
against them were withdrawn.
3. May I, 1970, Assault. During the Fall Quarter of
1970-71, one student was charged by the Univer
sity Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for assaulting an individual who
was blocking a doorway to Encina Hall on May I,
1970. The student elected to have his case heard
by the Dean of Students. At a hearing held in
November 1970, the Dean of Students sustained
the charges against the student and recommended
that the student be suspended from the University
for two quarters. This recommendation was ap
proved by the President.
4. May 1, 19 70, Disruption of a Biology Class. The
University Administration charged one student
during the Spring Quarter and two additional
students in the Fall Quarter with a violation of the

Policy on Campus Disruption for disrupting a
Biology class on May 1, 1970. Charges against one
student were withdrawn due to the inability of a
primary witness to recall the extent of that
student's participation in the incident. After hear
ings held in December 1970 and January 197 1, the
SJC found that a number of individuals entered
this class and shouted and chanted slogans
throughout the instructor's attempts to continue
his lecture, "Making it difficult if not impossible
for some members of the class to hear" the
instructor. The remaining two students were found
to have participated to an extent sufficient to
place them in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. The SJC recommended that one stu
dent be suspended for one year, with the entire
suspension being stayed pending good behavior.
The SJC found that the second student had played
a greater role in the disruption and recommended
a four quarter suspension with the last three
quarters to be stayed during good behavior.
5. September 28, 19 70, Forgery of Registration
Form. One student was charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard for forging the name of the individual
authorized to remove a "hold" on that student's
registration. A hearing was held by the Dean of
Students who recommended that a "hold" be
placed on this student's registration for an addi
tional quarter. This recommendation was approved
by the President.
6. November 23, 1970, Rock Throwing. Two stu
dents were charged by the University Administra
tion with violating the Fundamental Standard due
to their alleged participation in this incident. One
student was charged with throwing one or more
rocks at the Durand Building and the second
student with aiding, supporting, and encouraging
others to throw rocks. The SJC sustained the
charges against the first student and recommended
a sanction of seven consecutive quarters suspen
sion with the last four quarters stayed during good
behavior. The SJC recommended that the charges
against the second student be dismissed. Both
recommendations were approved by the President.
7. January 11, 971, Disruption of the Hoover
Institution Conference on the United Nations. The
University Administration charged ten individuals
before the SJC with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident. The
charges against two were withdrawn when it was
learned that one was no longer a student and that
the second had been misidentified. The SJC found
that a disruption had in fact occurred by reason of
the interjections, chanting, and rhythmic clapping
"designed to drown out the speakers" ? d that the
remaining eight students had participated suffi
ciently in that disruption in order to place them in
violation of the Policy on Campus Disruption. The
SJC recommended varying sanctions depending on
the extent of each student's participation in the
disruption and his prior disciplinary record. Ac
cordingly, it recommended a one quarter suspen
sion stayed during good behavior for one student;
a one quarter suspension with no stay for two
students; a two quarter suspension with one
quarter stayed during good behavior for one
student; a four quarter suspension with three
quarters stayed during good behavior for two
students; a four quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed during good behavior for one
student; and a four quarter suspension with no
stay for one student. The President approved all
recommendations, with the exception of that for

the four quarter suspension with no stay.
At the request of the defendant, the President
remanded the latter recommendation to the SJC
for reconsideration of the sanction. The defendant
had asserted that the SJC, in making that recom
mendation, had assumed that the defendant had
previously been convicted by the SJC of disrupting
University functions—whereas, in fact, the pre
vious convictions had been by the Superior Court
of California. Accordingly, the President asked the
SJC to consider the relevance of the fact that the
defendant's prior convictions had stemmed from
disruptions of University functions in violation of
a court injunction and were, therefore, convictions
by a State Court rather than by the SJC. During
the first week of the Spring Quarter, the SJC held
a further hearing on this issue and adhered to its
original recommendation.
8. February 7, 19 71, Rock Throwing. Two students
were charged by the University Administration
with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
throwing rocks at the Graduate School of Busi
ness. The SJC sustained the charges against one
student and recommended a sanction of seven
consecutive quarters suspension with the last four
quarters stayed during good behavior; this was
approved by the President. A hearing for the
second student has been postponed twice and is
now scheduled to be heard the second week of
April 1971.
9. February 10, 1971, Assault. Two students were
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for assault
ing a photographer at the Stanford Computation
Center. The SJC found that it could not sustain
the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and dis
missed both cases.
Cases Brought by Students, Faculty, or Staff
1. Assault. One student charged that another student
has violated the Fundamental Standard by assault
ing him on May 6, 1970. At the request of the
student charged, the case was heard by the Dean
of Students. The Dean's recommendation that the
case be dropped for insufficient evidence was
approved by the President.
2. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Psychol
ogy. The case was heard by the SJC which
recommended the dismissal of the charges. This
recommendation was approved by the President.
3. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
taking a homework paper belonging to another
student, copying it, turning it in for a grade, and
retaining the other student's original paper. At the
request of the student charged, the case was heard
by the Dean of Students. The Dean's recommenda
tion that the student be placed on probation for
three quarters was approved by the President.
4. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Political
Science. At the request of the student charged, the
4ase was heard by the Dean of Students. The
Dean's recommendation that the student be placed
on probation lor three quarters was approved by
the President.

University Administration charged one student
during the Spring Quarter and two additional
students in the Fall Quarter with a violation of the

Policy on Campus Disruption for disrupting a
Biology class on May 1, 1970. Charges against one
student were withdrawn due to the inability of a
primary witness to recall the extent of that
student's participation in the incident. After hear
ings held in December 1970 and January 197 1, the
SJC found that a number of individuals entered
this class and shouted and chanted slogans
throughout the instructor's attempts to continue
his lecture, "Making it difficult if not impossible
for some members of the class to hear" the
instructor. The remaining two students were found
to have participated to an extent sufficient to
place them in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. The SJC recommended that one stu
dent be suspended for one year, with the entire
suspension being stayed pending good behavior.
The SJC found that the second student had played
a greater role in the disruption and recommended
a four quarter suspension with the last three
quarters to be stayed during good behavior.
5. September 28, 19 70, Forgery of Registration
Form. One student was charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard for forging the name of the individual
authorized to remove a "hold" on that student's
registration. A hearing was held by the Dean of
Students who recommended that a "hold" be
placed on this student's registration for an addi
tional quarter. This recommendation was approved
by the President.
6. November 23, 1970, Rock Throwing. Two stu
dents were charged by the University Administra
tion with violating the Fundamental Standard due
to their alleged participation in this incident. One
student was charged with throwing one or more
rocks at the Durand Building and the second
student with aiding, supporting, and encouraging
others to throw rocks. The SJC sustained the
charges against the first student and recommended
a sanction of seven consecutive quarters suspen
sion with the last four quarters stayed during good
behavior. The SJC recommended that the charges
against the second student be dismissed. Both
recommendations were approved by the President.
7. January 11, 971, Disruption of the Hoover
Institution Conference on the United Nations. The
University Administration charged ten individuals
before the SJC with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident. The
charges against two were withdrawn when it was
learned that one was no longer a student and that
the second had been misidentified. The SJC found
that a disruption had in fact occurred by reason of
the interjections, chanting, and rhythmic clapping
"designed to drown out the speakers" ? d that the
remaining eight students had participated suffi
ciently in that disruption in order to place them in
violation of the Policy on Campus Disruption. The
SJC recommended varying sanctions depending on
the extent of each student's participation in the
disruption and his prior disciplinary record. Ac
cordingly, it recommended a one quarter suspen
sion stayed during good behavior for one student;
a one quarter suspension with no stay for two
students; a two quarter suspension with one
quarter stayed during good behavior for one
student; a four quarter suspension with three
quarters stayed during good behavior for two
students; a four quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed during good behavior for one
student; and a four quarter suspension with no
stay for one student. The President approved all
recommendations, with the exception of that for

the four quarter suspension with no stay.
At the request of the defendant, the President
remanded the latter recommendation to the SJC
for reconsideration of the sanction. The defendant
had asserted that the SJC, in making that recom
mendation, had assumed that the defendant had
previously been convicted by the SJC of disrupting
University functions—whereas, in fact, the pre
vious convictions had been by the Superior Court
of California. Accordingly, the President asked the
SJC to consider the relevance of the fact that the
defendant's prior convictions had stemmed from
disruptions of University functions in violation of
a court injunction and were, therefore, convictions
by a State Court rather than by the SJC. During
the first week of the Spring Quarter, the SJC held
a further hearing on this issue and adhered to its
original recommendation.
8. February 7, 19 71, Rock Throwing. Two students
were charged by the University Administration
with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
throwing rocks at the Graduate School of Busi
ness. The SJC sustained the charges against one
student and recommended a sanction of seven
consecutive quarters suspension with the last four
quarters stayed during good behavior; this was
approved by the President. A hearing for the
second student has been postponed twice and is
now scheduled to be heard the second week of
April 1971.
9. February 10, 1971, Assault. Two students were
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for assault
ing a photographer at the Stanford Computation
Center. The SJC found that it could not sustain
the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and dis
missed both cases.
Cases Brought by Students, Faculty, or Staff
1. Assault. One student charged that another student
has violated the Fundamental Standard by assault
ing him on May 6, 1970. At the request of the
student charged, the case was heard by the Dean
of Students. The Dean's recommendation that the
case be dropped for insufficient evidence was
approved by the President.
2. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Psychol
ogy. The case was heard by the SJC which
recommended the dismissal of the charges. This
recommendation was approved by the President.
3. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
taking a homework paper belonging to another
student, copying it, turning it in for a grade, and
retaining the other student's original paper. At the
request of the student charged, the case was heard
by the Dean of Students. The Dean's recommenda
tion that the student be placed on probation for
three quarters was approved by the President.
4. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Political
Science. At the request of the student charged, the
4ase was heard by the Dean of Students. The
Dean's recommendation that the student be placed
on probation lor three quarters was approved by
the President.

During Fall and Winter Quarters 1970-71, the Stanford
Judicial Council and the Dean of Students considered
charges brought against thirty-two students in connec
tion with thirteen incidents involving alleged violations
of University regulations. Nine of these incidents led to
charges brought by the University Administration, while
the remaining incidents resulted in charges brought by
students, faculty, or staff.
As of the close of Winter Quarter, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Dean of Students had held hearings and
made recommendations on all matters pending before
them, with the exception of the charges against two
individuals. Hearings on these latter two cases were
scheduled for late April.
Cases Brought by the University Administration
1. April 29, 1970, Rock Throwing. Prior to the close
of the Spring Quarter of 1970, one student was
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for inten
tionally throwing rocks at the Old Union. This
case was put over to the Fall Quarter. At a hearing
in November of 1970, the SJC sustained these
charges and recommended that a "hold" be placed
on this student's registration for a period of three
years. This recommendation was approved by the
President.
2. May 1, 1970, Disruption of a Class in Electrical
Engineering. During the Fall Quarter of 1970-71,
seven students were charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident.
Two of these students stipulated the facts and
requested the Dean of Students to hear their cases.
After a hearing held in November 1970, the SJC
decided that the class had been disrupted by a
number of individuals who, though not registered
in this course, entered the classroom, insisted that
the class discuss the "Cambodian Situation" and
were "unwilling to permit the class to proceed as a
normal class." Three of the four students were
found not to have actively participated in the
disruption and were therefore not in violation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption;one student was
found to have been an active participant. The SJC
found that there were mitigating circumstances
and recommended that the latter student be
suspended for one quarter, with the suspension to
be stayed during good behavior. These recommen
dations were approved by the President. The two
students who had elected to have their cases heard
by the Dean of Students were also not active
participants in the disruption, and, consequently,
on the basis of the SJC's decision, the charges
against them were withdrawn.
3. May I, 1970, Assault. During the Fall Quarter of
1970-71, one student was charged by the Univer
sity Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for assaulting an individual who
was blocking a doorway to Encina Hall on May I,
1970. The student elected to have his case heard
by the Dean of Students. At a hearing held in
November 1970, the Dean of Students sustained
the charges against the student and recommended
that the student be suspended from the University
for two quarters. This recommendation was ap
proved by the President.
4. May 1, 19 70, Disruption of a Biology Class. The
University Administration charged one student

quarters stayed during good behavior for two
students; a four quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed during good behavior for one
student; and a four quarter suspension with no
stay for one student. The President approved all
recommendations, with the exception of that for

the four quarter suspension with no stay.
At the request of the defendant, the President
remanded the latter recommendation to the SJC
for reconsideration of the sanction. The defendant
had asserted that the SJC, in making that recom
mendation, had assumed that the defendant had
previously been convicted by the SJC of disrupting
University functions—whereas, in fact, the pre
vious convictions had been by the Superior Court
of California. Accordingly, the President asked the
SJC to consider the relevance of the fact that the
defendant's prior convictions had stemmed from
disruptions of University functions in violation of
a court injunction and were, therefore, convictions
by a State Court rather than by the SJC. During
the first week of the Spring Quarter, the SJC held
a further hearing on this issue and adhered to its
original recommendation.
8. February 7, 19 71, Rock Throwing. Two students
were charged by the University Administration
with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
throwing rocks at the Graduate School of Busi
ness. The SJC sustained the charges against one
student and recommended a sanction of seven
consecutive quarters suspension with the last four
quarters stayed during good behavior; this was
approved by the President. A hearing for the
second student has been postponed twice and is
now scheduled to be heard the second week of
April 1971.
9. February 10, 1971, Assault. Two students were
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for assault
ing a photographer at the Stanford Computation
Center. The SJC found that it could not sustain
the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and dis
missed both cases.
Cases Brought by Students, Faculty, or Staff
1. Assault. One student charged that another student
has violated the Fundamental Standard by assault
ing him on May 6, 1970. At the request of the
student charged, the case was heard by the Dean
of Students. The Dean's recommendation that the
case be dropped for insufficient evidence was
approved by the President.
2. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Psychol
ogy. The case was heard by the SJC which
recommended the dismissal of the charges. This
recommendation was approved by the President.
3. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
taking a homework paper belonging to another
student, copying it, turning it in for a grade, and
retaining the other student's original paper. At the
request of the student charged, the case was heard
by the Dean of Students. The Dean's recommenda
tion that the student be placed on probation for
three quarters was approved by the President.
4. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Political
Science. At the request of the student charged, the
4ase was heard by the Dean of Students. The
Dean's recommendation that the student be placed
on probation lor three quarters was approved by
the President.

During Fall and Winter Quarters 1970-71, the Stanford
Judicial Council and the Dean of Students considered
charges brought against thirty-two students in connec
tion with thirteen incidents involving alleged violations
of University regulations. Nine of these incidents led to
charges brought by the University Administration, while
the remaining incidents resulted in charges brought by
students, faculty, or staff.
As of the close of Winter Quarter, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Dean of Students had held hearings and
made recommendations on all matters pending before
them, with the exception of the charges against two
individuals. Hearings on these latter two cases were
scheduled for late April.
Cases Brought by the University Administration
1. April 29, 1970, Rock Throwing. Prior to the close
of the Spring Quarter of 1970, one student was
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for inten
tionally throwing rocks at the Old Union. This
case was put over to the Fall Quarter. At a hearing
in November of 1970, the SJC sustained these
charges and recommended that a "hold" be placed
on this student's registration for a period of three
years. This recommendation was approved by the
President.
2. May 1, 1970, Disruption of a Class in Electrical
Engineering. During the Fall Quarter of 1970-71,
seven students were charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident.
Two of these students stipulated the facts and
requested the Dean of Students to hear their cases.
After a hearing held in November 1970, the SJC
decided that the class had been disrupted by a
number of individuals who, though not registered
in this course, entered the classroom, insisted that
the class discuss the "Cambodian Situation" and
were "unwilling to permit the class to proceed as a
normal class." Three of the four students were
found not to have actively participated in the
disruption and were therefore not in violation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption;one student was
found to have been an active participant. The SJC
found that there were mitigating circumstances
and recommended that the latter student be
suspended for one quarter, with the suspension to
be stayed during good behavior. These recommen
dations were approved by the President. The two
students who had elected to have their cases heard
by the Dean of Students were also not active
participants in the disruption, and, consequently,
on the basis of the SJC's decision, the charges
against them were withdrawn.
3. May I, 1970, Assault. During the Fall Quarter of
1970-71, one student was charged by the Univer
sity Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for assaulting an individual who
was blocking a doorway to Encina Hall on May I,
1970. The student elected to have his case heard
by the Dean of Students. At a hearing held in
November 1970, the Dean of Students sustained
the charges against the student and recommended
that the student be suspended from the University
for two quarters. This recommendation was ap
proved by the President.
4. May 1, 19 70, Disruption of a Biology Class. The
University Administration charged one student
during the Spring Quarter and two additional
students in the Fall Quarter with a violation of the

Policy on Campus Disruption for disrupting a
Biology class on May 1, 1970. Charges against one
student were withdrawn due to the inability of a
primary witness to recall the extent of that
student's participation in the incident. After hear
ings held in December 1970 and January 197 1, the
SJC found that a number of individuals entered
this class and shouted and chanted slogans
throughout the instructor's attempts to continue
his lecture, "Making it difficult if not impossible
for some members of the class to hear" the
instructor. The remaining two students were found
to have participated to an extent sufficient to
place them in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. The SJC recommended that one stu
dent be suspended for one year, with the entire
suspension being stayed pending good behavior.
The SJC found that the second student had played
a greater role in the disruption and recommended
a four quarter suspension with the last three
quarters to be stayed during good behavior.
5. September 28, 19 70, Forgery of Registration
Form. One student was charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard for forging the name of the individual
authorized to remove a "hold" on that student's
registration. A hearing was held by the Dean of
Students who recommended that a "hold" be
placed on this student's registration for an addi
tional quarter. This recommendation was approved
by the President.
6. November 23, 1970, Rock Throwing. Two stu
dents were charged by the University Administra
tion with violating the Fundamental Standard due
to their alleged participation in this incident. One
student was charged with throwing one or more
rocks at the Durand Building and the second
student with aiding, supporting, and encouraging
others to throw rocks. The SJC sustained the
charges against the first student and recommended
a sanction of seven consecutive quarters suspen
sion with the last four quarters stayed during good
behavior. The SJC recommended that the charges
against the second student be dismissed. Both
recommendations were approved by the President.
7. January 11, 971, Disruption of the Hoover
Institution Conference on the United Nations. The
University Administration charged ten individuals
before the SJC with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident. The
charges against two were withdrawn when it was
learned that one was no longer a student and that
the second had been misidentified. The SJC found
that a disruption had in fact occurred by reason of
the interjections, chanting, and rhythmic clapping
"designed to drown out the speakers" ? d that the
remaining eight students had participated suffi
ciently in that disruption in order to place them in
violation of the Policy on Campus Disruption. The
SJC recommended varying sanctions depending on
the extent of each student's participation in the
disruption and his prior disciplinary record. Ac
cordingly, it recommended a one quarter suspen
sion stayed during good behavior for one student;
a one quarter suspension with no stay for two
students; a two quarter suspension with one
quarter stayed during good behavior for one
student; a four quarter suspension with three
quarters stayed during good behavior for two
students; a four quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed during good behavior for one
student; and a four quarter suspension with no
stay for one student. The President approved all
recommendations, with the exception of that for

the four quarter suspension with no stay.
At the request of the defendant, the President

During Fall and Winter Quarters 1970-71, the Stanford
Judicial Council and the Dean of Students considered
charges brought against thirty-two students in connec
tion with thirteen incidents involving alleged violations
of University regulations. Nine of these incidents led to
charges brought by the University Administration, while
the remaining incidents resulted in charges brought by
students, faculty, or staff.
As of the close of Winter Quarter, the Stanford Judicial
Council and the Dean of Students had held hearings and
made recommendations on all matters pending before
them, with the exception of the charges against two
individuals. Hearings on these latter two cases were
scheduled for late April.
Cases Brought by the University Administration
1. April 29, 1970, Rock Throwing. Prior to the close
of the Spring Quarter of 1970, one student was
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for inten
tionally throwing rocks at the Old Union. This
case was put over to the Fall Quarter. At a hearing
in November of 1970, the SJC sustained these
charges and recommended that a "hold" be placed
on this student's registration for a period of three
years. This recommendation was approved by the
President.
2. May 1, 1970, Disruption of a Class in Electrical
Engineering. During the Fall Quarter of 1970-71,
seven students were charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident.
Two of these students stipulated the facts and
requested the Dean of Students to hear their cases.
After a hearing held in November 1970, the SJC
decided that the class had been disrupted by a
number of individuals who, though not registered
in this course, entered the classroom, insisted that
the class discuss the "Cambodian Situation" and
were "unwilling to permit the class to proceed as a
normal class." Three of the four students were
found not to have actively participated in the
disruption and were therefore not in violation of
the Policy on Campus Disruption;one student was
found to have been an active participant. The SJC
found that there were mitigating circumstances
and recommended that the latter student be
suspended for one quarter, with the suspension to
be stayed during good behavior. These recommen
dations were approved by the President. The two
students who had elected to have their cases heard
by the Dean of Students were also not active
participants in the disruption, and, consequently,
on the basis of the SJC's decision, the charges
against them were withdrawn.
3. May I, 1970, Assault. During the Fall Quarter of
1970-71, one student was charged by the Univer
sity Administration with a violation of the Funda
mental Standard for assaulting an individual who
was blocking a doorway to Encina Hall on May I,
1970. The student elected to have his case heard
by the Dean of Students. At a hearing held in
November 1970, the Dean of Students sustained
the charges against the student and recommended
that the student be suspended from the University
for two quarters. This recommendation was ap
proved by the President.
4. May 1, 19 70, Disruption of a Biology Class. The
University Administration charged one student
during the Spring Quarter and two additional
students in the Fall Quarter with a violation of the

Policy on Campus Disruption for disrupting a
Biology class on May 1, 1970. Charges against one
student were withdrawn due to the inability of a
primary witness to recall the extent of that
student's participation in the incident. After hear
ings held in December 1970 and January 197 1, the
SJC found that a number of individuals entered
this class and shouted and chanted slogans
throughout the instructor's attempts to continue
his lecture, "Making it difficult if not impossible
for some members of the class to hear" the
instructor. The remaining two students were found
to have participated to an extent sufficient to
place them in violation of the Policy on Campus
Disruption. The SJC recommended that one stu
dent be suspended for one year, with the entire
suspension being stayed pending good behavior.
The SJC found that the second student had played
a greater role in the disruption and recommended
a four quarter suspension with the last three
quarters to be stayed during good behavior.
5. September 28, 19 70, Forgery of Registration
Form. One student was charged by the University
Administration with a violation of the Fundamen
tal Standard for forging the name of the individual
authorized to remove a "hold" on that student's
registration. A hearing was held by the Dean of
Students who recommended that a "hold" be
placed on this student's registration for an addi
tional quarter. This recommendation was approved
by the President.
6. November 23, 1970, Rock Throwing. Two stu
dents were charged by the University Administra
tion with violating the Fundamental Standard due
to their alleged participation in this incident. One
student was charged with throwing one or more
rocks at the Durand Building and the second
student with aiding, supporting, and encouraging
others to throw rocks. The SJC sustained the
charges against the first student and recommended
a sanction of seven consecutive quarters suspen
sion with the last four quarters stayed during good
behavior. The SJC recommended that the charges
against the second student be dismissed. Both
recommendations were approved by the President.
7. January 11, 971, Disruption of the Hoover
Institution Conference on the United Nations. The
University Administration charged ten individuals
before the SJC with a violation of the Policy on
Campus Disruption as a result of this incident. The
charges against two were withdrawn when it was
learned that one was no longer a student and that
the second had been misidentified. The SJC found
that a disruption had in fact occurred by reason of
the interjections, chanting, and rhythmic clapping
"designed to drown out the speakers" ? d that the
remaining eight students had participated suffi
ciently in that disruption in order to place them in
violation of the Policy on Campus Disruption. The
SJC recommended varying sanctions depending on
the extent of each student's participation in the
disruption and his prior disciplinary record. Ac
cordingly, it recommended a one quarter suspen
sion stayed during good behavior for one student;
a one quarter suspension with no stay for two
students; a two quarter suspension with one
quarter stayed during good behavior for one
student; a four quarter suspension with three
quarters stayed during good behavior for two
students; a four quarter suspension with two
quarters stayed during good behavior for one
student; and a four quarter suspension with no
stay for one student. The President approved all
recommendations, with the exception of that for

the four quarter suspension with no stay.
At the request of the defendant, the President
remanded the latter recommendation to the SJC
for reconsideration of the sanction. The defendant
had asserted that the SJC, in making that recom
mendation, had assumed that the defendant had
previously been convicted by the SJC of disrupting
University functions—whereas, in fact, the pre
vious convictions had been by the Superior Court
of California. Accordingly, the President asked the
SJC to consider the relevance of the fact that the
defendant's prior convictions had stemmed from
disruptions of University functions in violation of
a court injunction and were, therefore, convictions
by a State Court rather than by the SJC. During
the first week of the Spring Quarter, the SJC held
a further hearing on this issue and adhered to its
original recommendation.
8. February 7, 19 71, Rock Throwing. Two students
were charged by the University Administration
with violations of the Fundamental Standard for
throwing rocks at the Graduate School of Busi
ness. The SJC sustained the charges against one
student and recommended a sanction of seven
consecutive quarters suspension with the last four
quarters stayed during good behavior; this was
approved by the President. A hearing for the
second student has been postponed twice and is
now scheduled to be heard the second week of
April 1971.
9. February 10, 1971, Assault. Two students were
charged by the University Administration with a
violation of the Fundamental Standard for assault
ing a photographer at the Stanford Computation
Center. The SJC found that it could not sustain
the charges beyond a reasonable doubt and dis
missed both cases.
Cases Brought by Students, Faculty, or Staff
1. Assault. One student charged that another student
has violated the Fundamental Standard by assault
ing him on May 6, 1970. At the request of the
student charged, the case was heard by the Dean
of Students. The Dean's recommendation that the
case be dropped for insufficient evidence was
approved by the President.
2. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Psychol
ogy. The case was heard by the SJC which
recommended the dismissal of the charges. This
recommendation was approved by the President.
3. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
taking a homework paper belonging to another
student, copying it, turning it in for a grade, and
retaining the other student's original paper. At the
request of the student charged, the case was heard
by the Dean of Students. The Dean's recommenda
tion that the student be placed on probation for
three quarters was approved by the President.
4. Cheating. A student was charged by a faculty
member with a violation of the Honor Code for
cheating on a mid-term examination in Political
Science. At the request of the student charged, the
4ase was heard by the Dean of Students. The
Dean's recommendation that the student be placed
