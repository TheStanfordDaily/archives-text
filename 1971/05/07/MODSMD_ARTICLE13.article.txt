# Trackmen Have Chance For Upset
## Stanford Hosts Bears In Big Meet 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN 
The 75th annual Big Meet, that
historic track confrontation
between Stanford and California,
will be considerably closer than
most observers would have
predicted even a week ago. Just
how close the Indians could come
to a major upset will depend on
their offsetting the weaknesses
that have marked their
disappointing team performance
all season.
Still, with the probable
absence of the Bear's premiere
sprinter Eddie Hart, the injuries to
their second sprinter Isaac Curtis,
and the heartening personal
performances of several Indians,
the meet has not been conceded
to California.
The Big Meet will commence at
1:15 p.m. this Saturday afternoon
at Stanford Stadium. A large
crowd is expected.
The Golden Bears are 6-3 for
the season and were brilliant last
Saturday—comina within two

points of upsetting the nation's
best dual-meet team, UCLA. The
Bears won the NCAA
championship meet team title last
season, but were stripped of the
crown this winter due to an
academic technicality.
Unfortunately for Cal, the
thrill of upset was marred by
Eddie Hart's pulled hamstring
muscle, suffered in the midst of
the 100 yard dash—which Hart
was leading.
Dave Maggard, the easy-going
California coach, said Monday
that Hart will not run
competitively until the May 21-22
Pac-8 championships. Isaac Curtis,
the brilliant sophomore who ran
9.3 as a freshman, has been
hampered by a weak and painful
right ankle.
Stanford's Chuck Francis,
conversely, was tremendously
impressive last Saturday against
Washington, winning the 100 in
9.5 and the 220 in a fine 21.2,
both season bests. Last year
Francis recorded a 9.3 100. Most

of his competition this Saturday
will come from long-haired Dave
Masters, who has starred each
week in the relays.
Tim Nicholson, who became
eligible for Stanford last Saturday,
recorded the Pac-B's best of
1:50.2 against Washington. He
will be challenged by the former
Los Altos High great Rick Brown
who has a 1:51.3 recorded this
season.
Masters said Monday that Drew
will race Duncan Mac Donald in
the mile. The Stanford star, while
surprisingly not among the Pac-8
leaders, should go below his
season best of 4:08.3. The Indians

must grab the third place in this
event and the three-mile if they
are to remain in the meet.
Randy White, who leads the
nation with his 50.7 intermediate
hurdles clocking set last Saturday
against Washington, is virtually
conceded his specialty. Rick
Tipton, who has been bumped in
his last two races and failed to
finish, must win (he has a 13.7
best and leads the Pac-8)
Saturday. Tom Long wiil
challenge the Bear's Don Lee for
second.
California's Jim Fraser set an
all-time Pac-8 best of 53'-l/4" last
week in the triple jump. He has

been consistently over 51' in the
last several meets. Allen Meredith
leaped 50'-9" last week against
Washington, and the
confrontation should be a classic.
Meredith has a lifetime best of
52'-3".
Casey Carrigan has not come
close in two years to his national
high school record of 17'-4 3/4".
His best this season is 16'-7",
although he narrowly missed at
17'1" against Oregon State. He
should win, with teammates Todd
Peterson and Tom Lindsay
contesting for second.
