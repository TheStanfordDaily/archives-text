# Randy White Paces Indian Track Team

### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The most amazing success in spring sports this year has been the
emergence of Randy White as a world class hurdler in his specialty,
the 440 yard intermediates.
The best time White could produce last year was a 52.3, but a
significant change in style has enabled the Senior from Burlingame to
dominate the Pac-8 in his event. White has improved on his all-time
Stanford record in almost every meet this year and the mark now
stands at the 50.7 timing turned in during last week's loss to
Wash ington.
New Style Offered Success
While at the Stanford-in-Britain campus last fall, White began
enjoying his training sessions for the first time as he took advantage of
the 600 acres of forest for long distance runs. "I worked harder than
usual because I heard reports that some of the guys on the team were
turning in really good times and I didn't want to be left behind,"
commented White.
By the time Stanford's opening meet with Fresno and Occidental
was to be held, however, White was not quite ready for the season and
he explained that he had to make an adjustment. ' I usually take 13
steps between hurdles but I added two steps per hurdle in order not to
strain anything. I ran by best time (51.2), however, and I thought that
it was a fluke. In our second meet against San Jose State, I ran a 51.7
and since I had not broken 52.3 all during my junior year I knew that
I had better not give up a good thing."
Randy's biggest race this year was against the second fastest
quarter miler in the world last year, Wayne Collett. White whipped
Collett with a time of 51.2 and established himself as the premier 440
yard hurdles man in the Pac-8. This was not to be the limit of White's
ability, however, and he continued his improvement by running a 50.7
last weekend against Washington. He feels that even this new Stanford
record is not a mark that will exist for long.
"I fouled up on four out of ten hurdles in the Washington meet
and still pulled out a 50.7. I have not run a great race yet. There are
many things that can go wrong in the 440 hurdles and I have not been
able to run a technically perfect race."
White's 50.7 gives him the third fastest time run in college this
year. Ralph Mann of BYU holds the world record with a timing of
48.8 and has run a 50.2 this season. If White continues improving, he
appears to have an excellent chance of achieving the honor that he
wants most, All-American. He will have to finish in the top four in the
NCAA Championships to be held June 17 at Washington, the scene of
his fastest time to date.

Although he is working out less and getting more results, White has
found this season to be emotionally draining. The Stanford track team
has not won a Pac-8 meet in two years and the team morale has been
hard to maintain under these conditions. "We had to face the two top
teams in the country (UCLA and Oregon) early in the season and have
gotten a lot of bad breaks claimed White. "Everyone is trying hard,
but you can get only so interested in losing."
Unsure of his future track plans, Randy does not want to commit
himself to an all out effort to excel in the 440 hurdles after college.
He explains his priorities, which might seem strange for a potential
Olympian.
"My first interest is to get my Masters in geophysics here at the
end of next year through the co-terminal program. Secondly, I am
anxious to get off on a camping trip this summer with the Sierra Club.
