# Crew Rows Against Bears
## 
### 
The Stanford crew is looking
forward to its most challenging
race of the season, tomorrow
against U.C. Berkeley in the
Oakland estuary.
For five years in a row the
Stanford Varsity has consistently
beaten the Cal eight, and this year
Cal Coach Marty McNair thinks he
has one of the best boats of his
career. Their record is about the
same as Stanford's having lost to
both Washington and UCLA.
Stanford's luck has been
discouraging since both the
Freshmen and Varsity boats swept
their three opponents in the
season's first race. After losing to
one of the perenially fastest crews
on the coast, the University of
Washington, the Varsity boat
travelled south for the Harbach
Cup, where UCLA, another
undefeated crew, passed by them
with an 11 second margin.
On the second day of their Los
Angeles trip they were surprised
by two unexpectedly good crews,
Long Beach and Loyola, and lost
to both of them. A week ago with
a new stroke, Harry Waters, the
first eight stretched their limbs
once again to beat a traditionally
weak opponent, St. Mary's, by 26
seconds.
The J.V. boat has had similar
misfortunes in losing to
Washington, UCLA and Long
Beach. Last week's three second
margin over St. Mary's brought

them their first victory of the
season.
Prospects are brighter for the
Frosh boat. Although they have
lost to the so far undefeated
Washington and UCLA eights as
Cal has, they were victorious
against Loyola while in the South.
The seating of the varsity boat
which races tomorrow is: cox Ron
