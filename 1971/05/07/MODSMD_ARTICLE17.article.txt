# Oregon And OSU Host Cards
## Baseball Needs Weekend Sweep 
### 
Another critical weekend is
looking coach Ray Young's
baseball team right in the face as
the Indians find themselves in a
must win position when they
travel to Oregon.Stanford needs a
doubleheader victory against
Oregon State this afternoon and
then a repeat performance against
Oregon on Saturday to stay on
the Pac-8 playoff battle with its
closest rival, UCLA.
The Indians sport of 6-5 league
record, one game behind second
place UCLA's 7-4 slate, with only
four league games left. USC has
first place virtually wrapped up
with an 11-0 mark, leaving only
one spot left to battle over.
The Uclans also face two

double headers this weekend
against Stanford's opponents of
last weekend, Washington and
Washington State, WSU has taken
over first place in the Northern
Division through the back door
after the Oregon teams were
destroyed in Los Angeles. The
Cougars, with a 5-4 record, have a
good chance to knock off UCLA
in at least one game if their
pitchingholds up. WSU's hefty
batters should provide fits for
Bruins' pitchers on Saturday in
Pullman.
If Stanford is able to complete
a sweep this weekend and UCLA
loses at least one of its four
games, the Indians should be the

odds-on favorites to nab the second
spot. Since UCLA must play USC
in the last two games of the
season, and Stanford has two
games with the doormat of the
division, Cal Berkeley, a Stanford
sweep this weekend is not
essential, but highly desirable for
the insurance it would provide.
In the event of a
Stanford-UCLA tie for second
place, the Indians would get the
nod for the playoffs since they
hold the 2-1 edge in the season
series.
Coach Young plans on
throwing his reliable foursome of
Dan Shaw, Bob Kammeyer, Tom
Schoen, and Bob DiPietro in quest
of a clean sweep.
