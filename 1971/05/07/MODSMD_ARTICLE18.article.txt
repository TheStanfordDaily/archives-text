# Coalition Battles Stanford Over Land Use Policy
## 
### CRAIG NORDLUND 
A new coalition of housing and
environmental groups have recently
banded together to fight a common
enemy "overdevelopment in the
midpeninsula."
At a press conference held yesterday
in Menlo Park, spokesmen from each of
the ten groups struck out against the
"insensitivity" of the Livingston Land
Use Policy/Plan for Stanford lands.
In a combined statement, the
coalition said that such development as
suggested in the Livingston report
"would aggravate the present regional
situation caused by an acute housing
shortage, inadequate public
transportation, high unemployment
rate in the minority community and
ensuing social problems caused by
deficiencies in social planning."
Coalition spokesman Ida Berk said
that a letter had been sent to the
Trustees requesting that they hold open
public meetings to discuss the
Policy/Plan.
The letter stated in part: "We are
concerned about the impact of future
Stanford land development on the
midpeninsula communities surrounding
Stanford.
"Before you take any action on this
report, we request that you, the Board
of Trustees, hold open public hearings
on the Stanford Campus. We would be
happy to present some constructive
alternatives for Stanford land use at a
public hearing held by the Trustees."

There was great concern by all
groups present that the trustees might
review and rubber stamp the proposed
Policy/Plan without being aware of its
full impact on the surrounding
communities.
The spokesman for the Legal Aid
Society of San Mateo County, Cy
Rosenthal summed up this feeling when
he said "the trustees must not exercise
power in a vacuum." He added that the
trustees should obtain input from all
people who will be affected by this
development of Stanford Lands,
"particularly those disenfranchised
people east of Bayshore."
The coalition chairman, Ida Berk
said that the ten groups represented
many various constituencies and "most
have divergent views on many
subjects," but she emphasized that they
had united against the Willow
Expressway and over concern for
housing needs and "overdevelopment."
She added that the coalition
represented a very wide base and that
she hoped the trustees and the local
governments would take note of this.
The new coalition includes: Citizens
Against Willow Expressway, Committee
for Green Foothills, Columbae House,
East Palo Alto Welfare Rights
Organization, Legal Aid Society of San
Mateo County, Northside Action
Group, Palo Alto Tenants Union,
Redwood City Probe Center, Sierra
Club, and Central Palo Alto Residents
Association-West.
