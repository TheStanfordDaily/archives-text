Rogers, Israelis Meet
JERUSALEM — Secretary of State William P. Rogers,
arriving in this Holy City on the last stop of his
Mideast tour, appealed to Israel yesterday "to meet
the challenge and, indeed, the agony of peace."
Rogers went promptly into a conference with
Premier Golda Meir and other Israeli leaders. State
Department press officer Robert J. McCloskey said
there was "a good and animated exchange of views
throughout the two hours and 20 minutes" of the
meeting.
He added that Rogers summarized for the Israeli
policy makers the impressions he had received from
his journey to four Arab countries, but he brought no
specific proposals for a broad settlement or a deal to
reopen the Suez Canal.
Israeli Foreign Minister Abba Eban said there was
"an exchange of views. We haven't gotten yet to
discuss the real problems."
Hoffman Bailed Out
NEW YORK — Yippie leader Abbie Hoffman was
released in $20,000 bail yesterday on a charge of
interstate travel to incite to riot during antiwar
demonstrations in Washington this week.
Hoffman, arrested Wednesday night in the lobby
of his East Village apartment house by FBI agents,
also was accused of assaulting a Washington
policeman last Monday.
U.S. Commissioner Earl N. Bishoppset May 17 for
a hearing on whether Hoffman should be removed to
Washington.
An informer in Norman, Okla., reported to the
FBI that Hoffman told the students the activities in
Washington "will make Chicago in 1968 look like a
YAF meeting."
"We plan to do it, and we plan to do it in the
streets when the government opens next Monday," he
was quoted as saying in a government affidavit.
"We're stopping the government-unless they want to
stop the war. They've got 47 hours."

Doves Plan Strategy
WASHINGTON — The Senate opened debate on
extension of the draft yesterday as anti-war forces
mapped plans for a major drive to force total U.S.
withdrawal from Indochina by the end of 1971.
Democratic leader Mike Mansfield said he thinks
the draft measure is a proper vehicle for the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment to bar funds for U.S.
forces in Southeast Asia after Dec. 31. Mansfield also
said he might renew his proposal for a sharp
reduction in U.S. troops in Europe.
Sen. J.W. Fulbright, D-Ark., called a meeting for
Friday afternoon to consider alternative courses. He
told reporters he favored bringing up the
McGovern-Hatfield amendment on the draft bill "if it
has a good chance of success."
Pollution Deadline Set
WASHINGTON — William D. Ruckelshaus,
administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, warned the auto industry yesterday it must
exhaust every effort to reduce significantly the
emission of air pollutants by 1975.
A Ford Motor Co. official said the deadline may
be impossible to meet.
"We do not at this time know whether we will be
successful in meeting 1975 emission requirements,"
said L.H. Misch, a Ford Vice President in charge of
engineering.
Nixon Backs Lockheed
WASHINGTON — Against expected heavy opposition
in Congress, President Nixon proposed yesterday to
put the government's backing behind a $250 million
loan for Lockheed Aircraft Corp. and its troubled
TriStar jumbo jet project.
Lockheed desperately needs the money "to keep it
from going broke," Treasury Secretary John B.

Connally told newsmen. And he said the economy
needs a healthy Lockheed and the investment in
money and jobs in the TriStar program.
He said $1.4 billion already is tied up in
development of the TriStar, which he called w a very
excellent airplane. . . probably the most advanced
today."
The administration said Lockheed needs the loan
to finish production of the Tri-Star L1011 airbus,
which fell into jeopardy when the manufacturer of
the TriStar engine, Rolls-Royce Ltd., went into
receivership in Great Britain.
Connally said the British government will put up
$288 million in additional funds to help produce the
engine.
He added that banks have already put up $450
million in loans for Lockheed. In addition, he said,
Lockheed suppliers have invested $350 million and
airlines have advanced $240 million in progress
payments in anticipation that the airbus will be built.
Customs Drug Search
WASHINGTON — The Customs Bureau yesterday
ordered intensified inspection of U.S. soldiers
returning from Southeast Asia, and complete
inspection of military mail parcels, in a crackdown on
a flood of high-grade heroin and other hard narcotics
coming into the United States.
Customs Commissioner Myles J. Ambrose said the
flow of hard narcotics into the United States through
military channels had reached serious proportions.
His action comes on the heels of a probe by a
special House panel that recommended a maximum
effort be undertaken to halt the illegal shipment of
drugs through soldiers stationed in Indochina.
Ambrose said the Defense Department is
cooperating fully with Customs in the crackdown.
