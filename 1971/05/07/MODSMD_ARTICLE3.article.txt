### JONATHAN DEDMON 
Fired hospital worker Sam Bridges is
one of six persons currently being
sought by authorities in connection
with the violent clash between
demonstrators and police at the
Stanford Hospital on April 9.
Warrents for the arrest of the six

charge them with nine counts of
misdemeanors, including failure to
disperse, participating in a riot,
malicious mischief, resisting arrest, and
trespass.
The warrants, filed May 4, bring to
30 the number of persons charged in
connection with the hospital

disturbance in which 23 persons were
arrested.
The six sought are: Sam Bridges, the
black hospital worker whose firing
brought about the sit-in; Katie Kurtz, a
Stanford sophomore; Sherry Archer,
believed to be the daughter of a
hospital staff member; Bruce Pollock, a
Redwood City community worker; Phil
Trounstein, a Venceremos newspaper
photographer; and Robert Seablock,
occupation unknown.
The University administration has
meanwhile charged three students with
violation of the campus disruption
policy for participation in the sit-in.
The names of the three students
charged has not been made public. Five
students were arrested at the hospital
sit-in. They were: BSU Chairman Willie
Newberry, Molly Dougherty, Phil Lind,
former BSU Chairman Leo Bazile, and

Fred Johnson. Johnson and Bazile were
not arrested at the sit-in itself, but in
related incidents.
SJC Hearing
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
will hear charges against the three next
Tuesday night.
Assistant to the President John
Schwartz said last night that he had
"no plans right now" to file further
charges before the SJC concerning the
hospital sit-in.
Of the 23 persons arrested at the
hospital incident, 19 persons are
currently being arraigned in Superior
Court.
The defendants have been divided
into three groups. The first is composed
of seven persons charged with felonious
assault on a police officer, in addition
to nine counts of misdemeanors.
At their appearance in court on
Wednesday, an additional charge of
carrying clubs was added to the charges
against five of the seven. The other
groups consist of persons who have
been charged only with misdemeanors.
The Seven
The seven persons currently charged
with felonies are: BSU Chairman Willie
Newberry; Anthony Chatman, a
medical staff worker from Redwood
City; Jean Dolly, an active member of
the Midpeninsula Free University, from
Palo Alto; Irwin Lavenburg, of
Redwood City; Steve Henry, of
Redwood City; and John Alan Kay, of
Palo Alto.
In addition to the above six, arrested
at the sit-in, police arrested Nicholas
Harper, a Black Liberation Front (BLF)
member last weekend in Redwood
City. Harper's charges, in addition to
felonius assault at the sit-in, include
carrying a concealed weapon and
possession of marijuana.
Law Commune worker Janelle
James said last night that some of the
charges stemmed from a search of
Harperat the time of his arrest.
Six of twelve persons charged only
with misdemeanors appeared in court
yesterday, and the remaining six are
scheduled to appear today.
