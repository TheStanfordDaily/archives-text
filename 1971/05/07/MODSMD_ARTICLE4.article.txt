# 'Spring Offensive' Brings Record Arrests
## 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
During the past five days in Washington, D.C.,
more than 13,000 arrests have been made as a
disruptive, week-long antiwar "Spring Offensive,"
aimed at shutting down the federal government and
thereby ending the Indochinese War, has run its
course.
In terms of sheer quantity, that many arrests in
four days for civil disobedience in one city is
probably unprecedented, at least in modern history.
At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago, for example, 668 persons were arrested. At
People's Park (Berkeley, 1969) about 3,000 persons
were taken into custody.
But aside from being a massive display of civil
disobedience, the Mayday Tribe's manoeuvers have
been a disaster, both for the peace movement —
assuming there still is such a thing — and for the
people involved.
The demonstrators never achieved their goal:
government operations were not even slowed down.
Most departments reported above-normal attendance
during the week, even when employees were required
to report for work at 3:30 a.m.
But it was not "business as usual" for the million
or so people who live and work in Washington.
Thousands of people woke up Monday morning
choking on the tear gas that the police were
"liberally" dispensing in several sections of the city.
Other people — construction workers, small shop
owners and employees, and even the demonstrators'
attorneys — became enmeshed in the various brief
battles for the bridges which cross the Potomac River.
The disruptions unquestionably prevented business as
usual for these people.
In fact, the demonstrators could not stop
downtown traffic even when they had 20,000 willing
bodies to do it. In a cruel, yet highly telling display of
irony, Washington police quietly stopped and
rerouted 10th Street and Constitution Avenue traffic

when the demonstrators massed near the Justice
Department.
The demonstrations clearly were not educational.
No serious attempt was made to explain why the
government had to be shut down the Indochinese
War. Most Washington residents simply felt
threatened by the demonstrators and by the police
department's wide spread use of tear gas.
The attitude of the demonstrators was not a
positive one. Perhaps the best evidence of this is the
problems encountered in the West Potomac Park
campsite, where the predominant interests were dope
and acid, not ending the war or education.
Worse still, the demonstrators apparently were
stealing from one another — or if not, they didn't
have the foresight to establish camp defenses to
preserve each other's property. Boots, sleeping bags,
clothing — almost anything brought into the campsite
was apparently fair game for other campers.
The "Spring Offensive" probably cost the peace
movement some support on Capitol Hill. It is
impossible to tell so soon after the demonstrations,
but virtually every "peace oriented" Senator and
Representative came out against these
demonstrations. And if the peace movement can't
sustain pressure in the dovish Senate, then it has
probably lost any hope of legislating an end to the
war.
The Mayday Tribe, however, hasn't admitted
defeat. It plans to return to Washington during the
summer, as does the Student Mobilization Committee
(SMC), which organized the April 24 Washington
rally.
The long range effects of the week of
demonstrations cannot yet be effectively measured. It
certainly did not broaden the appeal of the peace
movement as did the massive, peaceful Moritoriums
and April 24 rallies. And it certainly did not improve
the standing of the peace lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
It is however, apparent that much of Washington
has been alienated and confused by the
demonstrators and their tactics.
Only one thing is now clear: President Nixon, as

was the case in all previous peace demonstrations, was
not impressed by what he heard (especially since he
was conveniently out of the city during the height of
the disruptions.) And he certainly will not be
pressured into ending the war any earlier by the use
of such disruptive tactics. So in that sense, too, the
demonstrations were a failure.

people involved.
The demonstrators never achieved their goal:
government operations were not even slowed down.
Most departments reported above-normal attendance
during the week, even when employees were required
to report for work at 3:30 a.m.
But it was not "business as usual" for the million
or so people who live and work in Washington.
Thousands of people woke up Monday morning
choking on the tear gas that the police were
"liberally" dispensing in several sections of the city.
Other people — construction workers, small shop
owners and employees, and even the demonstrators'
attorneys — became enmeshed in the various brief
battles for the bridges which cross the Potomac River.
The disruptions unquestionably prevented business as
usual for these people.
In fact, the demonstrators could not stop
downtown traffic even when they had 20,000 willing
bodies to do it. In a cruel, yet highly telling display of
irony, Washington police quietly stopped and
rerouted 10th Street and Constitution Avenue traffic

when the demonstrators massed near the Justice
Department.
The demonstrations clearly were not educational.
No serious attempt was made to explain why the
government had to be shut down the Indochinese
War. Most Washington residents simply felt
threatened by the demonstrators and by the police
department's wide spread use of tear gas.
The attitude of the demonstrators was not a
positive one. Perhaps the best evidence of this is the
problems encountered in the West Potomac Park
campsite, where the predominant interests were dope
and acid, not ending the war or education.
Worse still, the demonstrators apparently were
stealing from one another — or if not, they didn't
have the foresight to establish camp defenses to
preserve each other's property. Boots, sleeping bags,
clothing — almost anything brought into the campsite
was apparently fair game for other campers.
The "Spring Offensive" probably cost the peace
movement some support on Capitol Hill. It is
impossible to tell so soon after the demonstrations,
but virtually every "peace oriented" Senator and
Representative came out against these
demonstrations. And if the peace movement can't
sustain pressure in the dovish Senate, then it has
probably lost any hope of legislating an end to the
war.
The Mayday Tribe, however, hasn't admitted
defeat. It plans to return to Washington during the
summer, as does the Student Mobilization Committee
(SMC), which organized the April 24 Washington
rally.
The long range effects of the week of
demonstrations cannot yet be effectively measured. It
certainly did not broaden the appeal of the peace
movement as did the massive, peaceful Moritoriums
and April 24 rallies. And it certainly did not improve
the standing of the peace lobbyists on Capitol Hill.
It is however, apparent that much of Washington
has been alienated and confused by the
demonstrators and their tactics.
Only one thing is now clear: President Nixon, as

was the case in all previous peace demonstrations, was
not impressed by what he heard (especially since he
was conveniently out of the city during the height of
the disruptions.) And he certainly will not be
pressured into ending the war any earlier by the use
of such disruptive tactics. So in that sense, too, the
demonstrations were a failure.
During the past five days in Washington, D.C.,
more than 13,000 arrests have been made as a
disruptive, week-long antiwar "Spring Offensive,"
aimed at shutting down the federal government and
thereby ending the Indochinese War, has run its
course.
In terms of sheer quantity, that many arrests in
four days for civil disobedience in one city is
probably unprecedented, at least in modern history.
At the 1968 Democratic National Convention in
Chicago, for example, 668 persons were arrested. At
People's Park (Berkeley, 1969) about 3,000 persons
were taken into custody.
But aside from being a massive display of civil
disobedience, the Mayday Tribe's manoeuvers have
been a disaster, both for the peace movement —
assuming there still is such a thing — and for the
people involved.
