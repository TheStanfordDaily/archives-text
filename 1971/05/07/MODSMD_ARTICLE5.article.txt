# Changes In Financial Administration
## University Vice-Presidential Structure Altered 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
The University administrative structure will soon be
modified. On July 1, 1971, the offices of Vice President for
Business Affairs and Vice President for Finance will be
replaced by a single Vice President for Business and Finance.
Slated to fill this post is Robert Augsburger, former Executive
Vice President and Director of the New York investment
banking firm of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
At the same time the present Vice President for Finance,
Kenneth Cuthbertson, will become Vice President for
Development.
Opportunity For Shift
The opportunity for the shift resulted from the resignation
of Vice President for Business Affairs, Alf E. Brandin, last
July. Brandin had held his position since 1959. At that time
the President of the University had a policy of clear delegation
of responsibility in financial and academic areas by creating
Vice Presidencies for Business Affiars and Finance, and the
Provostship.
Cuthbertson, who has been Vice President for Finance
since 1959, says that the separation of business (which
includes operations), and finance (which includes budgeting),
is "unusual and not desirable." He noted that at the time of
his appointment, job responsibilities were determined largely
by the "strengths of the particular people involved." At that
time the large land development program and the normal
utilities management were handled by the office of Business
Affairs, while Finance handled the areas of budgeting and
fund raising.
With Brandin's resignation some changes in the structure of
the Vice Presidencies were in order, because the peak of the

land development program had passed and the expansion of
the University will not be as rapid in the next years, declining
from around 10-12 percent to about 7 percent a year.
Brandin's exit set the stage for a re-organization which could
keep pace with changing University policies.
Three main reasons were cited for combining two Vice
presidencies into the Vice Presidency for Business and
Finance. First there is "a need for coordination of financial
analysis and actual operations and maintenance." In order to
measure the consequence of financial policy, the President
wants a man with both management and financial background.
Secondly, Cuthbertson noted that "the President is far
more involved in governance problems, academic problems,
and the survival of the University, and has less time to resolve
differences between financial analysis and operations."
Finally, the soon-to-be Vice President for Development
observed, "the University is in as crucial a fund raising period
as it ever has been."
Fund Raiser
The Vice President for Development will concentrate his
efforts in this area of fund raising. Responsible to the
President for planning, coordinating, and managing the gift
procurement programs of the University, he will maintain
liason with the President, the Provost, the Deans and other
officers, in order to relate the financial requirements of the
University to potential resources of private gift support. Also
among his duties will be supervision of the professional
staffing of the gift procurement efforts, and provision of
services to volunteer leadership and workers in these efforts.
The University will attempt to raise its support from the
present level of 30 million dollars per year to a level of 50
million dollars per year, comparable to Harvard's. Cuthbertson

feels that "the climate is not as receptive as it used to be," and
Stanford will have to compete strongly to "get a larger share
of the philanthropic dollars." The extra increment gets harder
and harder to obtain as more money is raised, and
Cuthbertson speculated that "not all private institutions will
survive," and some will have to be taken over by the public.
Crusical Post
Although about 70% of all funds go into academic channels
and are handled through the Provost's office, the new office of
Vice President for Business and Finance is still a crucial one.
Responsible to the President for planning and managing the
University's financial affairs, physical plant, and other real
property and lands within the authority granted by the Board
of Trustees, the Vice President supervises development and
control of University budgets, and provides staff services to
the investment program.
He will supervise staff personnel administration, employee
relations, and the various financial and business services such
as those provided by the Controller and Business Manager, and
oversees operations of the University Press.
Robert Augsburger, the new Vice President, is certainly no
stranger to the field of business and finance. A native of
Canton, Ohio, he holds a Bachelor of Science degree in
engineering from Purdue, and a law degree from Case Western
Reserve University School of Law. His business experience has
been largely in financial analysis and investment, although he
comments that he has always had a "strong avocational
interest in education."
Ready For A Change
Like so many businessmen, Augsburger felt himself ready
for "re-potting," as he puts it. Ten to twelve hours on Wail

Street every day (coupled with three hours of commuting)
allowed him "no opportunities for the personal satisfaction I
sought," so he left his position before he had any definite
alternative in mind.
President Lyman had been searching for a man of
Augsburger's talents since the decision to create a Vice
President for Business and Finance. Contact was made with
Augsburger in January and after several trips by Dr. Lyman to
New York and by Augsburger to Stanford, he was
recommended for the position.
This is not Augsburger's first contact with Stanford; he
served for many years as a recruiter for firms at the Business
School, and lectured at some of the Stanford summer
programs. He is unruffled by the transition from a business to
an academic environment and says"I think good business
management practices apply anywhere-from a home to a large
enterprise like a University, business, or what have you. The
differences are in the communication process. Decisions in
business are accepted because they arc handed down from a
position of responsibility; the University is more of a political
entity where people are sensitive and interested in everything
which goes on."
Augsburger sees another difference between a University
and the business sphere: evaluation. "The University is more
nebulous, one can't quantify the evaluation of progress like in
business." Augsburger has set up an office in Encina Hall in
order to evaluate the University's problems and familiarize
himself with existing priorities before he takes office officially
in July. The BAP program of belt tightening is nothing new to
him since business is experiencing the same type of budget
pressures, and he seems to look forward to working within thr
University environment.
