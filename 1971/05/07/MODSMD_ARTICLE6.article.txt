# sjc and the sit-in
## Law At Stanford-Lyman's Toy 
###

Every time momentum develops to deal with the basic problems of
this community, the University starts up its legal machinery to stop
that movement. It was not enough to have the police attack a peaceful
sit-in or deny to negotiate the BSU demands. Determined to maintain
the racist, imperialist nature of this institution, the administration is
again using its control of the legal apparatus at Stanford to suppress
those who deal with the problems here. Next week the BSU will hold
a convocation on Racism. The administration response is to charge
Willie Newberry. Chairmen of the BSU, and Molly Dougherty,
Venceremos, both arrested at the hospital sit-in, before the SJC for
the sit-in. They both face substantial jail terms in the criminal courts.
This is no routine SJC harassment of political activists. The
machinery is working overtime in closed-door proceedingsl to see that
Stanford's racism is not dealt with. Sienna, Schwartz and a third
lawyer are sweating trying to find a loophole in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter to change the decision in Janet Weiss' last case.
Since she was already suspended for four quarters, is barred from
the campus and is working, Janet decided to not go through with the
hearing. The Charter provides: "Sanctions for refusal to cooperate will
consist (1) of placing a hold on next-quarter registration ..." Not
satisfied with this prospect, University Prosecutor John Schwartz
moved: "Mrs. Weiss should be ordered by the Council to appear for a
hearing at the specified time and place on the charges against her and,
should she not appear as ordered without a showing of good cause for
her non-appearance, the Council should proceed with a hearing of the

case in her absence ..." The Council realized that power to do this is
not in the Charter, and decided to put a hold on her registration until
a hearing on the case is completed.
In the meantime, while the three lawyers are digging for loopholes
in the Charter, Building 10 is also pressuring SJC Chairman Howard
Williams to adopt rules—behind closed doors—in violation of the
Charter. The Charter explicitly grants legistlative power to the
Student Conduct Legislative Council and Committee of 15. Yet, the
SJC now claims it has an "implied power to do such acts as are
reasonably necessary and appropriate to enable it to perform its
assigned duties" to adopt these rules. And, in specific instances, these
rules conflict with the Charter if not the Constitution.
These rules seek to grant the Chairman power to compel any
student or faculty member to testify. For non-cooperation, the
Council can request (from Lyman) expulsion for the student or
disciplinary proceedings for the faculty member.
The Council also is seeking to grant the Chairman contempt power
and establish power to remove a Council member if that person
"ceases to perform his duties as a Council member."
Wednesday night the Committee of 15 tried to move that all rules
proposed by the SJC be first reviewed by the C-15 for conflicts with
the Charter. Schwartz and Rosensweig—Lyman's appointees to the
Committee, and the two men who convinced Miller and Wilson to call
the police on the people at the sit-in nervously denied that these new
rules would have anything to do with the upcoming SJC hospital cases
and ran out of the meeting, breaking up the quorum and preventing a
vote. What interests have they got in these rules?
Now that a black man, who has promised to deal with racism here,
is being brought before the SJC, the administration works overtime to
violate and manipulate judicial procedures. Not content with trying to
send Willie and Molly to jail, the administration is trying to force
them to put on their full defense before their criminal trial in the real
courts or face possible expulsion. The administration well knows that
tapes of SJC proceedings—even of closed hearings—can be supboenaed
by the D.A. Lyman, is this the way you deal with racism in your
institution?
Are the campus judicial procedures instruments of justice or just
Lyman's toys?

her non-appearance, the Council should proceed with a hearing of the

case in her absence ..." The Council realized that power to do this is
not in the Charter, and decided to put a hold on her registration until
a hearing on the case is completed.
In the meantime, while the three lawyers are digging for loopholes
in the Charter, Building 10 is also pressuring SJC Chairman Howard
Williams to adopt rules—behind closed doors—in violation of the
Charter. The Charter explicitly grants legistlative power to the
Student Conduct Legislative Council and Committee of 15. Yet, the
SJC now claims it has an "implied power to do such acts as are
reasonably necessary and appropriate to enable it to perform its
assigned duties" to adopt these rules. And, in specific instances, these
rules conflict with the Charter if not the Constitution.
These rules seek to grant the Chairman power to compel any
student or faculty member to testify. For non-cooperation, the
Council can request (from Lyman) expulsion for the student or
disciplinary proceedings for the faculty member.
The Council also is seeking to grant the Chairman contempt power
and establish power to remove a Council member if that person
"ceases to perform his duties as a Council member."
Wednesday night the Committee of 15 tried to move that all rules
proposed by the SJC be first reviewed by the C-15 for conflicts with
the Charter. Schwartz and Rosensweig—Lyman's appointees to the
Committee, and the two men who convinced Miller and Wilson to call
the police on the people at the sit-in nervously denied that these new
rules would have anything to do with the upcoming SJC hospital cases
and ran out of the meeting, breaking up the quorum and preventing a
vote. What interests have they got in these rules?
Now that a black man, who has promised to deal with racism here,
is being brought before the SJC, the administration works overtime to
violate and manipulate judicial procedures. Not content with trying to
send Willie and Molly to jail, the administration is trying to force
them to put on their full defense before their criminal trial in the real
courts or face possible expulsion. The administration well knows that
tapes of SJC proceedings—even of closed hearings—can be supboenaed
by the D.A. Lyman, is this the way you deal with racism in your
institution?
Are the campus judicial procedures instruments of justice or just
Lyman's toys?

Every time momentum develops to deal with the basic problems of
this community, the University starts up its legal machinery to stop
that movement. It was not enough to have the police attack a peaceful
sit-in or deny to negotiate the BSU demands. Determined to maintain
the racist, imperialist nature of this institution, the administration is
again using its control of the legal apparatus at Stanford to suppress
those who deal with the problems here. Next week the BSU will hold
a convocation on Racism. The administration response is to charge
Willie Newberry. Chairmen of the BSU, and Molly Dougherty,
Venceremos, both arrested at the hospital sit-in, before the SJC for
the sit-in. They both face substantial jail terms in the criminal courts.
This is no routine SJC harassment of political activists. The
machinery is working overtime in closed-door proceedingsl to see that
Stanford's racism is not dealt with. Sienna, Schwartz and a third
lawyer are sweating trying to find a loophole in the Legislative and
Judicial Charter to change the decision in Janet Weiss' last case.
Since she was already suspended for four quarters, is barred from
the campus and is working, Janet decided to not go through with the
hearing. The Charter provides: "Sanctions for refusal to cooperate will
consist (1) of placing a hold on next-quarter registration ..." Not
satisfied with this prospect, University Prosecutor John Schwartz
moved: "Mrs. Weiss should be ordered by the Council to appear for a
hearing at the specified time and place on the charges against her and,
should she not appear as ordered without a showing of good cause for
her non-appearance, the Council should proceed with a hearing of the

case in her absence ..." The Council realized that power to do this is
not in the Charter, and decided to put a hold on her registration until
a hearing on the case is completed.
