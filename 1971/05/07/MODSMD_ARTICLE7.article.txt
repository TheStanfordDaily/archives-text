## objectivity 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the Daily article of Wed.
May 5, entitled 'Medical Center
Worker Assaulted', it seems
mighty funny to us that you at
the Daily as well as most of the
"mass media" covering the
Stanford political scene, manage
very well to discover the race and
supposed "reason" for the assault
on the worker (the lead sentence
of your article reads: "Mary Jane
Schmidt, a Caucasian employee of
the Stanford Medical Center, was
assaulted in her home Sunday
night by two unidentified black
men." The Mar. 6 edition has a
head implying that intimidation
killed a Black worker (Threatened
Worker Dies.)
But you can't likewise identify
acts of terrorism against the black
population of this "sincere and
dedicated" university. Junipero is
one of the three Black
"concentration" dorms, and has
14 black residents out of 75.
Junipero is the setting, or was, for
Black Student Union meetings, as
well as occasional meetings of
black Pre-Med students, and other
black groups. The lounge where
these groups met, where threse
students live, was burned while
students were asleep in the
building. Yet only when this point
is brought out by writers and

persons outside of the Daily or
the administration does the public
find out about it.
A Black law student, who,
incidentally, is working on the
defense of those busted at the
Med Center, lost his car in an
arsonous fire shortly after the
bust, yet it took the Daily some
days before it got around to
mentioning this.
Yet, we are supposed to believe
that terrorism is a black activity,
that blacks have so little faith in
the justice of their cause that they
must resort to threats and
brutality to obtain their ends.
Such prejudiced reporting is what
comes to be called "objectivity"
in this country.
Your "objectivity" and your
"rational dialogue" are merely
tools used by this society to keep
the outcast down, to retain
control for the ruling estate of
this country. (Rational dialogue:
when you walk up to a man with
his foot on your brother's throat
and ask him to remove that foot
before he chokes your brother,
and he answers, "Well, let's talk
about it."
As presently used, neither of
these terms is worth using. The
Daily especially ought to refute
claim to the word "objectivity."
How can it be objective when,
since the administrative attack on
it last fall, it has been an
informational tool primarily for

the furtherance of administrative
causes?
We wish to remind the Daily
that part of its funds comes from
the Student Body, as well as the
Administration. And we, as
students, expect that our money
will go towards a paper that
represents a somewhat unbiased
opinion, meaning a paper that
reports all sides of a conflict, not
just the administrative side.
