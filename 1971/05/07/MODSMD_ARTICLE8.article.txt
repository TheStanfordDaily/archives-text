# Reforms Reach Board of Trustees
## 
### CRAIG COTORA 
in 1969 the Educational
Testing Service of Princeton New
Jersey conducted a national
survey of university trustees from
which a "troubling picture
emerges."
It found that "trustees
generally tended to be indifferent
to academic values and
uninformed about issues and
problems in contemporary higher
education." The average trustee
surveyed was in the 50's, 98
percent were white, over half had
yearly incomes exceeding $30,000
and 35 percent were business
executives.
At least 14 of Stanford's 24
Trustees have had extensive
business experience and still
pursue roles in business as
executives or consultants. Despite
the apparent business-oriented
background of Stanford's trustees,
there has been a significant
increase of trustees with either
administrative or professional
educational experience: Ernest
Arbuckel, a former Dean of
Standord's Business school, John
W. Gardner, a former HEW chief,
Dennis Hayes, a former Stanford
Student Body President, Ira Hall,
a Stanford Senior Class President,
President Lyman, and former
President Sterling.
In addition to this shift in the
professional background of board
members, the average age of board
members has decreased slightly
from 57 to 54, and with the new
requirement that at least half of
the eight alumni elected members
be under 36 and pending new
Trustee appoinements that figure
might continue to decrease.
Turnover
Probably the most striking
feature about the Board in the
past year is the amount of
turnover among the membership.
Since February of 1970 five board
members have resigned. Two

resigned due to scheduling
conflicts with professional
interests, two because of "illness
in the family," and another for
"personal reasons."
The first full term replacement
for those successive vacancies
was Mr. Peter S. Bing - a
businessman and former Stanford
Student Body President, who was
appointed Nov. 10, 1970. Three
months later the Board of
Trustees announced the election
of Mr. W.D. Eberle and Mr.
Thomas Killefer to the Board.
There is no one factor which
accounts for the apparent
slowness in appointing new
members. Presently all but five
Trustees have been elected by the
Board itself based upon
recommendations submitted by
the Committee on Nominations
chaired by Trustee Morris Doyle.
Fred Glover, assistant to the
President, commented on the
apparent tardiness of new
appointments: "Since the
Trustee's role in the university is
so important, it is only natural
that the selection process be
thorough." Glover added that he
expected the empty positions to
be filled "very soon."
Although none of the Trustees
specifically stated that the
increasing load of Trustee work
might act as a deterrent for
potential Trustee candidates,
there were implications that
certain aspects of the job have

become extremely demanding.
Certainly the increasing
quantity and complexity of
university problems that the
Board must deal with is one
factor. The Board has ultimate
responsibility of reviewing all
financial allocations in the
university, and the total operating
expenditure of the university has
trebled from forty million to a
hundred and thirty million dollars
in just ten years. Stanford spent
more money in 1970 than the
municipal government of St.
Louis.
Pressures Of Time
Still another heavy demand of
Trustee work is time. The board
meetings themselves are usually
held for two or three days at the
beginning of each month, but
most of the Trustees time is spent
at fund raising activities, talks
with individual or groups of
alumni, committee homework,
and just trying to keep up with
what is happening on campus.
The time demand is not only
hard on the Trustee's themselves.
When a Daily reporter tried to
obtain an interview with a Trustee
by calling his home, the Trustee's
wife lamented for five minutes
over the phone that her husband
was hardly ever home anymore.
The time required to be a well
informed and effective board
member has led many critics of
the Board to demand that

Trustees should not pursue other
professional interests or do so
only in a consulting or limited
capacity.
It is not surprising to find that
the amount of time that
individual Trustees spend on
Board work varies greatly.
Chairman of the Board William
Fuller stated that "several
members of the Board spend over
fifty percent of their time on
Board duties while others spend
substantially less time on Trustee
work."
Why Work?
In face of some of the heavy
responsibilities of Trustee work
and the criticism the Board often
receives from alumni and
students, it does not seem
unreasonable to wonder why a
person would want to be a
Trustee in the first place.
Board Chairman Fuller cited
family ties as a decisive influence
on him. He stated that 56 close
relatives have either attended
Stanford or been connected with
the university in one capacity or
another. For Ernest Arbuckle, his
personal involvement with

Stanford was a prominent factor.
He spent seven years at Stanford
as a student and served as Dean of
the Business school before
becoming a Trustee. Ira Hall felt
that one of the most persuasive
factors for joining the board was a
personal desire to "get a feeling of
how the university process
worked and see how things might
be changed."
The basic functions of the
Board are defined in the Founding
Grant-the legal document in
which the Stanford family
enumerated certain properties and
resources to be left "in trust" for
the building of a university.
Besides endowing the Board with
final legal responsibility for the
university, this charter grants to
the Board the "power to do all
things necessary to the proper
exercise of the trust."
Under this provision of the
grant, the board chooses a new
university president when
required, delegates operating
power, preserves and increases
financial resources, reviews the
budget, and supervises land use
and development.

chaired by Trustee Morris Doyle.
Fred Glover, assistant to the
President, commented on the
apparent tardiness of new
appointments: "Since the
Trustee's role in the university is
so important, it is only natural
that the selection process be
thorough." Glover added that he
expected the empty positions to
be filled "very soon."
Although none of the Trustees
specifically stated that the
increasing load of Trustee work
might act as a deterrent for
potential Trustee candidates,
there were implications that
certain aspects of the job have

become extremely demanding.
Certainly the increasing
quantity and complexity of
university problems that the
Board must deal with is one
factor. The Board has ultimate
responsibility of reviewing all
financial allocations in the
university, and the total operating
expenditure of the university has
trebled from forty million to a
hundred and thirty million dollars
in just ten years. Stanford spent
more money in 1970 than the
municipal government of St.
Louis.
Pressures Of Time
Still another heavy demand of
Trustee work is time. The board
meetings themselves are usually
held for two or three days at the
beginning of each month, but
most of the Trustees time is spent
at fund raising activities, talks
with individual or groups of
alumni, committee homework,
and just trying to keep up with
what is happening on campus.
The time demand is not only
hard on the Trustee's themselves.
When a Daily reporter tried to
obtain an interview with a Trustee
by calling his home, the Trustee's
wife lamented for five minutes
over the phone that her husband
was hardly ever home anymore.
The time required to be a well
informed and effective board
member has led many critics of
the Board to demand that

Trustees should not pursue other
professional interests or do so
only in a consulting or limited
capacity.
It is not surprising to find that
the amount of time that
individual Trustees spend on
Board work varies greatly.
Chairman of the Board William
Fuller stated that "several
members of the Board spend over
fifty percent of their time on
Board duties while others spend
substantially less time on Trustee
work."
Why Work?
In face of some of the heavy
responsibilities of Trustee work
and the criticism the Board often
receives from alumni and
students, it does not seem
unreasonable to wonder why a
person would want to be a
Trustee in the first place.
Board Chairman Fuller cited
family ties as a decisive influence
on him. He stated that 56 close
relatives have either attended
Stanford or been connected with
the university in one capacity or
another. For Ernest Arbuckle, his
personal involvement with

Stanford was a prominent factor.
He spent seven years at Stanford
as a student and served as Dean of
the Business school before
becoming a Trustee. Ira Hall felt
that one of the most persuasive
factors for joining the board was a
personal desire to "get a feeling of
how the university process
worked and see how things might
be changed."
The basic functions of the
Board are defined in the Founding
Grant-the legal document in
which the Stanford family
enumerated certain properties and
resources to be left "in trust" for
the building of a university.
Besides endowing the Board with
final legal responsibility for the
university, this charter grants to
the Board the "power to do all
things necessary to the proper
exercise of the trust."
Under this provision of the
grant, the board chooses a new
university president when
required, delegates operating
power, preserves and increases
financial resources, reviews the
budget, and supervises land use
and development.
in 1969 the Educational
Testing Service of Princeton New
Jersey conducted a national
survey of university trustees from
which a "troubling picture
emerges."
It found that "trustees
generally tended to be indifferent
to academic values and
uninformed about issues and
problems in contemporary higher
education." The average trustee
surveyed was in the 50's, 98
percent were white, over half had
yearly incomes exceeding $30,000
and 35 percent were business
executives.
At least 14 of Stanford's 24
Trustees have had extensive
business experience and still
pursue roles in business as
executives or consultants. Despite
the apparent business-oriented
background of Stanford's trustees,
there has been a significant
increase of trustees with either
administrative or professional
educational experience: Ernest
Arbuckel, a former Dean of
Standord's Business school, John
W. Gardner, a former HEW chief,
Dennis Hayes, a former Stanford
Student Body President, Ira Hall,
a Stanford Senior Class President,
President Lyman, and former
President Sterling.
In addition to this shift in the
professional background of board
members, the average age of board
members has decreased slightly
from 57 to 54, and with the new
requirement that at least half of
the eight alumni elected members
be under 36 and pending new
Trustee appoinements that figure
might continue to decrease.
Turnover
Probably the most striking
feature about the Board in the
past year is the amount of
turnover among the membership.
Since February of 1970 five board
members have resigned. Two

resigned due to scheduling
conflicts with professional
interests, two because of "illness
in the family," and another for
"personal reasons."
The first full term replacement
for those successive vacancies
was Mr. Peter S. Bing - a
businessman and former Stanford
Student Body President, who was
appointed Nov. 10, 1970. Three
months later the Board of
Trustees announced the election
of Mr. W.D. Eberle and Mr.
Thomas Killefer to the Board.
There is no one factor which
accounts for the apparent
slowness in appointing new
members. Presently all but five
Trustees have been elected by the
Board itself based upon
recommendations submitted by
the Committee on Nominations
chaired by Trustee Morris Doyle.

Board Chairman Fuller cited
family ties as a decisive influence
on him. He stated that 56 close
relatives have either attended
Stanford or been connected with
the university in one capacity or
another. For Ernest Arbuckle, his
personal involvement with

Stanford was a prominent factor.
He spent seven years at Stanford
as a student and served as Dean of
the Business school before
becoming a Trustee. Ira Hall felt
that one of the most persuasive
factors for joining the board was a
personal desire to "get a feeling of
how the university process
worked and see how things might
be changed."
The basic functions of the
Board are defined in the Founding
Grant-the legal document in
which the Stanford family
enumerated certain properties and
resources to be left "in trust" for
the building of a university.
Besides endowing the Board with
final legal responsibility for the
university, this charter grants to
the Board the "power to do all
things necessary to the proper
exercise of the trust."
Under this provision of the
grant, the board chooses a new
university president when
required, delegates operating
power, preserves and increases
financial resources, reviews the
budget, and supervises land use
and development.
in 1969 the Educational
Testing Service of Princeton New
Jersey conducted a national
survey of university trustees from
which a "troubling picture
emerges."
It found that "trustees
generally tended to be indifferent
to academic values and
uninformed about issues and
problems in contemporary higher
education." The average trustee
surveyed was in the 50's, 98
percent were white, over half had
yearly incomes exceeding $30,000
and 35 percent were business
executives.
At least 14 of Stanford's 24
Trustees have had extensive
business experience and still
pursue roles in business as
executives or consultants. Despite
the apparent business-oriented
background of Stanford's trustees,
there has been a significant
increase of trustees with either
administrative or professional
educational experience: Ernest
Arbuckel, a former Dean of
Standord's Business school, John
W. Gardner, a former HEW chief,
Dennis Hayes, a former Stanford
Student Body President, Ira Hall,
a Stanford Senior Class President,
President Lyman, and former
President Sterling.
In addition to this shift in the
professional background of board
members, the average age of board
members has decreased slightly
from 57 to 54, and with the new
requirement that at least half of
the eight alumni elected members
be under 36 and pending new
Trustee appoinements that figure
might continue to decrease.
Turnover
Probably the most striking
feature about the Board in the
past year is the amount of
turnover among the membership.
Since February of 1970 five board
members have resigned. Two

resigned due to scheduling
conflicts with professional
interests, two because of "illness
in the family," and another for
"personal reasons."
The first full term replacement
for those successive vacancies
was Mr. Peter S. Bing - a
businessman and former Stanford
Student Body President, who was
appointed Nov. 10, 1970. Three
months later the Board of
Trustees announced the election
of Mr. W.D. Eberle and Mr.
Thomas Killefer to the Board.
There is no one factor which
accounts for the apparent
slowness in appointing new
members. Presently all but five
Trustees have been elected by the
Board itself based upon
recommendations submitted by
the Committee on Nominations
chaired by Trustee Morris Doyle.
Fred Glover, assistant to the
President, commented on the
apparent tardiness of new
appointments: "Since the
Trustee's role in the university is
so important, it is only natural
that the selection process be
thorough." Glover added that he
expected the empty positions to
be filled "very soon."
Although none of the Trustees
specifically stated that the
increasing load of Trustee work
might act as a deterrent for
potential Trustee candidates,
there were implications that
certain aspects of the job have

become extremely demanding.
Certainly the increasing
quantity and complexity of
university problems that the
Board must deal with is one
factor. The Board has ultimate
responsibility of reviewing all
financial allocations in the
university, and the total operating
expenditure of the university has
trebled from forty million to a
hundred and thirty million dollars
in just ten years. Stanford spent
more money in 1970 than the
municipal government of St.
Louis.
Pressures Of Time
Still another heavy demand of
Trustee work is time. The board
meetings themselves are usually
held for two or three days at the
beginning of each month, but
most of the Trustees time is spent
at fund raising activities, talks
with individual or groups of
alumni, committee homework,
and just trying to keep up with
what is happening on campus.
The time demand is not only
hard on the Trustee's themselves.
When a Daily reporter tried to
obtain an interview with a Trustee
by calling his home, the Trustee's
wife lamented for five minutes
over the phone that her husband
was hardly ever home anymore.
The time required to be a well
informed and effective board
member has led many critics of
the Board to demand that

Trustees should not pursue other
professional interests or do so
only in a consulting or limited
capacity.
It is not surprising to find that
the amount of time that
individual Trustees spend on
Board work varies greatly.
Chairman of the Board William
Fuller stated that "several
members of the Board spend over
fifty percent of their time on
Board duties while others spend
substantially less time on Trustee
work."
Why Work?
In face of some of the heavy
responsibilities of Trustee work
and the criticism the Board often
receives from alumni and
students, it does not seem
unreasonable to wonder why a
person would want to be a
Trustee in the first place.
Board Chairman Fuller cited
family ties as a decisive influence
on him. He stated that 56 close
relatives have either attended
Stanford or been connected with
the university in one capacity or
another. For Ernest Arbuckle, his
