## Stones Roll Out New Album 
### CAPTAIN HORNSBY 
Rolling Stones, STICK Y FINGERS
Rolling Stones Records C0C59100
Speaking of androgynous
sado-masochism, The Rolling
Stones have released a new album
entitled "Sticky Fingers." As
befits the first record to be put
out on the Stones' new label,
Rolling Stone Records, the cover
(front, back and inside) is a
genuine Andy Warhol, complete
with functional Zipper and a
non-functional Andy Warhol
non-statement printed on the
photograph of the jockey shorts
hiding beneath the photograph of
the bulging Levi's. If you must
know, it says "This photograph
may not be . . . etc."
Well, it may not be a
photograph of Mick Jagger
wearing shorts, but I'm sure we all

would like it to be. By the way,
rumor has it that every 10,000 th
copy has an inner cover photo
without shorts.
As if the package were not
attractive enough already, the
dust jacket provides more thrills.
On one side is a black and white
picture of the Stones looking
feyer than ever. On the other side
is a large red drawing of the
Stones' new label trademark: an
open mouth with luscious red lips
and a seductively protruding
tongue - in short, the essence of
Mick Jagger.
Jagger's personality has an
incredible magnetism and
fascination which have not been
diminished in the least by the
effects of age, drugs, or Altamont.
If anything, Jagger has

encompassed all of these events
and experiences and has emerged
bigger than life, a whole bigger
than some of his parts.
At a time when John Lennon is
wracked by painful introspection,
when Paul McCartney has
returned to the comforts of home
and hearth, when Bob Dylan has
lost his sting in the sliding ooze of
a pedal steel guitar, and when
many established rock groups are
recreating a myth of Sisyphus in
agonizing imitation of their own
e'irlier songs, Mick Jagger just
becomes more like Mick Jagger,
with nasty habits and satin shoes.
As Mick sings in "Memo from
Turner," the song he did for the
film "Performance," "Come now,
gentlemen, your love is all 1 crave.
You'll still be in the circus, when
I'm laughin', laughin' in my
grave."
Without a doubt, Mick Jagger
is the crucial element in the
Rolling Stones. When he is right,
the Stones are the world's greatest
rock and roll band. The group's
live concert at the Oakland
Coliseum in November, 1969,
demonstrated clearly how the
Stones revolve around Jagger. On
"Sticky Fingers" Mick and the
Stones play just plain damn good
rock 'n roll.
The Stones have never
forgotten the essentials of a good
rock song, and they demonstrate
that fact on every cut on this
album. Their control over their
music is incredible; you don't
have to play a Stones' album loud
to feel its intensity.
"Brown Sugar" and "Bitch,"
which were released as a "45" a
few weeks before the album
release, are classic Stones' songs,
dealing with subjects dear to
Mick's debauched heart.
"I Got the Blues" employs a
vintage Otis Redding horn
arrangement and has much of the
feel of "I've Been Loving You
Too Long (To Stop Now)." The
Stones pay tribute to legendary
bluesman Mississippi Fred
McDowell in their version of his
"You Gotta Move."

Jagger's lyrics are once again a
treasure trove of dilettantish
juxtapositions, historical allusions,
and pleasant little perversities:
"Send me dead flowers to my
wedding,/ And I won't forget to
put roses on your grave."
"Wild Horses" is an
outstanding ballad that really
grows on you with repeated
listenings. On "Can't You Hear
Me Knocking," a song with the
most memorable lead guitar figure
since "Honky Tonk Women," the
Stones get into some very
interesting improvisation that
varies from their usually
abbreviated instrumental breaks.
They carry it off very well, and as
usual, Charlie Watts' drumming is
crisp, steady, and powerful.
On "Stinky Fingers" the
Stones, to paraphrase the
Contours, are back to let you
know they can really shake 'em
down.
ROCK ON:
San Francisco scored a
technical knockout victory over
Smokin' Joe Frazier last Sunday
night at Winterland when the
Champ and his all-star soul review
played to an underflow crowd of
i25 or so. Unconfirmed sources
report that Joe received a

Hallmark condolence from A 1
Kooper.
This weekend, Miles Davis
becomes the first jazz artist ever
to head the bill at Fillmore West.
The Elvin Bishop Group will also
appear along with a group called
Mandrill.
Van Morrison is performing at
New Orleans House in Berkeley,
while lovely Jackie DeShannon
takes over for little Leslie Gore at
the Fairmont.
On Sunday, Elton John, Lamb,
and Mark-Almond will be at the
S.F. Civic Auditorium. Elton John
is a fine live performer, and if
you're into his music at all, the
concert should be well worth
seeing.
If you're in the habit of
spending your weekends at San
Francisco College for Women at
Lone Mountain, you won't want
to miss the performance of The
Who's "Tommy" tonight through
Sunday.
Finally, country music freaks
will a) want to see or b) not want
to see (pick one) Johnny Cash
when he appears at the Oakland
Coliseum on May 23, in concert
with his TV show regulars and a
group called the Tennessee Three.
(I could say "free the Tennessee
Three," but 1 won't.)

GIT'N IT ON—An honest-to-God coffeehouse/folk guitar cafe has
returned to Palo Alto. 'Top of the Tangent', located at 117 University
& The Circle, features fine acoustic guitar every Wednesday, Friday,
and Saturday nights. Local cooksters audition Wednesday and the
humdingers flash on the weekend. Price is nice'n cheap ($1.00) and
the food and drink downstairs is fine porkin'. The news is getting
around, so you may have to get there fairly early—like around 9:15 or
so. Say Hi to Stephen and Hazel Sak (they're the entrepreneurs) as
you step in.
