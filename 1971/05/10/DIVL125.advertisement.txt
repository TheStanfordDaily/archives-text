YOUR TRANSCENDENTAL INVITATION
This album, with pictures and full text, produced by George Harrison,
is a first recording of pure devotional songs in the ancient spiritual
language SANSKRIT. Vibrations of these mantras reveal to the
receptive hearer and chanter the realm of KRSNA consciousness,
joyfully experienced as a peace of self and awareness of GOD and
KRSNA. These eternal sounds of love release the hearer from all
contemporary barriers of lime and space.
