# Broadcasters Question FCC Ruling
## 
### FREP MANN 
More than six months ago, Vice-President Spiro
Agnew unleashed one of his infamous verbal assaults,
this time against the popular recording industry.
Following the leads of such social critics as Art
Linkletter, George Wallace, and the Pentagon (which
had blacklisted some 20 songs from Armed Forces
radio), he blasted the pop song writers of the world
for stealthily undermining the morals of the teenage
generation by slipping into their lyrics passages
glorifying the use of illegal drugs.
Agnew went on to reveal the secret meaning of
such songs as "Acapulco Gold " and "With A Little
Help From My Friends."
Four months later on March 5, the Federal
Communications Commission, the regulatory group
which licenses radio and television stations across the
nation, leapt into action. In a "public notice" issued
to all radio stations, the FCC half-heartedly moved to
back up the urgings of the vice-president and others
by warning broadcasters that they must know the
words to the songs that they are playing over the air.
The notice issued no specific guidelines to follow
regarding the playing of songs that "tend to promote
or glorify the use of illegal drugs such as marijuana,
LSD, speed, etc." but reminded the licensee that they
"can not properly follow a policy of playing such
records."
Nick Charges Censorship
The response from stations across the nation has
been far from acquiesence. Many broadcasters,
especially those on the West Coast have spoken out
bluntly against the ruling. As the only dissenting FCC
commissioner, Nicholas Johnson, put it: "This public
notice is an unsuccessfully disguised effort by the

FCC to censor song lyrics that the majority
disapproves of; it is an attempt by a group of
establishmentarians to determine what youth can say
and hear. It is an unconstitutional action by a Federal
agency aimed clearly at controlling the content of
speech."
Although many stations have agreed with Johnson
and have failed to totally comply with the FCC's
ruling, very few have actually challenged the decision
by complaint or court action. No one is particularly
anxious to sue the very board that in December will
be determining whether or not they will be allowed
to keep their broadcasting license.
One of the stations in this awkward position is
Stanford's own, KZSU. "The FCC's ruling is
ridiculous," said KZSU station manager Will Pape. "It
is so vague that it will take a court case to feel the
real impact of the commission's concern."
Not Ready To Fight
But KZSU is in no position to make itself the
guinea pig.
KZSU reporter Andy Ellis emphasized that the
FCC had previously received complaints about
obscenity, mainly at rallies broadcast live over the
station, and therefore, the station did not wish to
aggravate the Commission by challenging them on the
drug lyrics issue.
"We have complied to the extent that the
executive board knows what lyrics are being
broadcast," said Pape, "But we don't know of any
songs that glorify hard drugs. If there were such
songs, we wouldn't play them. We at KZSU totally
agree with Nick Johnson's statement on the issue."
Although KZSU has purposely taken a backseat in
the controversy, two college stations have already
taken the Commission to district court in Washington

over the matter. KUOP at the University of the
Pacific in Stockton and WYBC at Yale filed a joint
complaint last month seeking to overturn the FCC's
ambiguous ruling claiming the policy was an
abridgement of first amendment rights.
Although the court refused to accept jurisdiction
in the case and urged the complainants to take the
issue up with the FCC itself, the two stations are
persisting, and are currently involved in appeals.
Confusing Clarification
Some non-commercial stations, including the
Pacifica chain, have asked the FCC to reconsider their
controversial March 5 notice, but have received only
an equally confusing "clarification statement" for
their troubles.
"The FCC's only concern is to see that all stations
are broadcasting 'in the public interest','' said KUOP
Director of Broadcasting Jim Erwin. "But if a song
seems to promote the use of illegal drugs, is it
necessarily against the public interest? I happen to
think that progressive rock music serves the public
interest as an art form, and art forms are
ambiguous—and impossible to legislate against.
"The only matter over which the FCC has specific
authority of censorship is obscenity," he said. "And
the majority of our listening audience probably
wouldn't find songs about drugs obscene. I think the
FCC is trying to push an unconstitutional policy on
us," Erwin added.
KUOP as well as WYBC at Yale continue to play
any song they choose although they too have set up
some sort of bureaucracy to fulfill their obligations to
the Commission and help insure renewal of their
licenses. "We review the records before we put them
on the air," concluded Erwin, but I doubt if we
would ever be faced with one that we didn't want to
play."

CENSORSHIP—This faceless D.J. may be in trouble. For years he has been trying
to corrupt our youth with songs promoting drugs and revolution. Now the FCC
and Spiro Agnew say that such indoctrination must stop.
