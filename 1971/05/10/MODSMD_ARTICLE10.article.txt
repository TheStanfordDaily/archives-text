Hitchiking?
A judiciary committee of the State
Senate in Sacramento will conduct
public hearings on Tuesday, for a bill
that would restrict hitchiking in
California. Senate Bill 92, introduced
by Sen. John Nejedly (R.Walnut
Creek), would prohibit hitchiking at
any location where stopping a car is
prohibited.
According to the State Vehicle
Code, it is illegal for a car to stop next
to any red-painted curb, at any bus
stop, in front of any driveway, at
freeway entry ramps, on the roadway
side of any parked vehicle, and at other
places.
Friends of the Open Road, a
Berkeley-based group formed to
organize opposition to the bill,
announced Sunday that it will attend
the hearings at the State Capital to give
testimony to the members of the
Judiciary Committee, which will decide
whether to pass the bill to the Senate
floor. The hearings are open to the
public. Interested organizations and
individuals can attend and may speak
before the committee.
The hearings will be held at 9:00
a.m. and 3:00 p.m., on Tuesday, May
11 in room 4203, in the State Capital
in Sacramento.
Actress Speaks
Eva Bartok, stunningly beautiful
actress of stage and screen, recently
returned from a four year retreat in
Indonesia, will be speaking here today

at 4 p.m. in Tresidder Union Large
Lounge, on the 'Radical
Transformation of Man.' Eva now feels
that the very explicit nature of her
experiences in Indonesia, coupled with
her earlier exposure to revolution and
repression in Hungary under both the
Nazi and Communist regimes, make it
important for her to speak now of
revolution and radical change, after her
preparatory silence.
Her talk is sponsored by Education
as Awareness, a relatively new student
group, which is functioning as a
switchboard for individuals and groups
which are concerned with developing
and living new forms of education. Eva
contacted the Education as Awareness
group through a group called 'Subud'.
Gowns For Peace
Graduates who would like to express
their concern for peace and who feel
that the matter of caps and gowns is
unimportant in comparison to what is
occurring in Vietnam, are encouraged
to donate cap and gown money to
bring an end to the war.
May 19 is the last day for cap and
gown refunds. There will be a table on
White Plaza May 10-19 to accept
contributions and answer questions.
