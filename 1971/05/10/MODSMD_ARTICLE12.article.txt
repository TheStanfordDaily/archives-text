Dollar Weakened In Europe
Four strong-currency nations in Western Europe,
beset by inflation they blame on a glut of U.S.
dollars, made their money worth more yesterday in
comparison with American currency.
Switzerland revalued its franc upward by 7
percent. It was the strongest move against the dollar,
which has been weakened by years of U.S. balance of
payments deficits.
Austria boosted its schilling by 5.05 percent,
making the dollar worth only 24.75 schillings against
26 previously.
West Germany's Cabinet decided to float the mark
on world markets which is expected to increase its
value in relation to the dollar.
The Netherlands followed the German lead,
deciding to let the guilder float.
France and Italy said they were not interested in
floating their currencies because they have no dollar
problems.
Rogers Returns
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P.
Rogers returned from his two-week, Mideast
peace-seeking mission last night, saying there has been
some narrowing of differences between Arabs and
Israelis.
Rogers told newsmen upon his arrival at Andrews
Air Force Base:
"I think the difference between the parties has
narrowed some and I think both sides generally
would like to move toward peace."
An Egyptian spokesman said after the meeting
between Assistant Secretary of State Joseph Sisco
and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, "There is no
change in the situation . . . the differences continue
to be great between the Egyptian and Israeli views."
All in all, Rogers said, "I am somewhat more
encouraged" about the Mideast situation than when
he left on the 18,000 mile trip.

Rogers' mission in the last two weeks focused
particularly on the possibilities of an Egyptian-Israeli
deal to reopen the Suez Canal as a first step toward a
general Mideast settlement.
Laird Looks Past Vietnam
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
said yesterday the United States should focus its
attention now on what happens after Vietnam and
what is needed to counter Russia's growing
momentum.
It is time, he said, to shift the dialogue from "why
vietnamization" to "beyond Vietnam" and to focus
on "what's in store for us, from the national security
standpoint beyond Vietnam."
Laird also indicated his lack of enthusiasm for
lifting trade restrictions with Red China.
The Secretary said that while the United States has
been tied down in Southeast Asia since 1965 Russia
has been able to use its defense resources to attain a
position of "more or less parity in the strategic
nuclear weapons area" and at the same time has gone
forward with naval modernization and ground force
modernization. Russia, he said has a "tremendous
weapons momentum."
Mars Shot Fails
CAPE KENNEDY,FIa. — "We're heartbroken," a
space agency official said yesterday as investigators
sought a reason for the failure of the Mariner 8 Mars
shot and crews prepared a twin craft, Mariner 9, for
launching May 18.
Mariner 9 could be delayed, depending on what
the investigation turns up.
The first half of the $53.6 million project to orbit
Mars with two satellites failed Saturday night less
than five minutes after liftoff. The second stage of
the Atlas-Centaur rocker tumbled out of control 92
miles above the earth and plunged with its pay load

into the Atlantic Ocean 900 miles southeast of Cape
Kennedy.
"The mission is lost," came the terse
announcement from the launch control center.
Mariners 8 and 9 were the first spacecraft built to
orbit another planet. Mariner 8 was to have
conducted a broad mapping mission while Mariner 9
was to have made repeated studies of six selected
areas to note atmospheric surface and seasonal
changes. Each was equipped with two television
cameras and several sensors.
The information could determine if conditions
exist on Mars in which some primitive form of life,
such as microbes or plants could exist.
Big Walk For Hungry
As many as four million persons from statesmen to
hippies and children trekked miles for dollars
yesterday in the first "international walk for
development." The money went to feed the world's
hungry.
Marchers in 600 cities of 50 countries covered at
least 10 million miles. In some cities, such as Accra in
Ghana, the walking began Friday.
Hundreds of thousands most of them young
marched yesterday in cities across the United States.
Spokesmen said more than 487,000 Americans
walked in 92 communities yesterday compared with
another 150,000 who turned out in 113 towns and
cities Saturday.
Suicide Protest
SAIGON — A young Buddhist monk burned himself
to death in Hue yesterday in protest against the
Vietnam war. He left behind letters asking President
Nixon and President Nguyen Van Thieu to work for
peace.
In other developments a water taxi crowded with
civilians headed for market hit two floating mines in a
river near the demilitarized zone yesterday, killing at
least 30 Vietnamese.

the Atlas-Centaur rocker tumbled out of control 92
miles above the earth and plunged with its pay load

into the Atlantic Ocean 900 miles southeast of Cape
Kennedy.
"The mission is lost," came the terse
announcement from the launch control center.
Mariners 8 and 9 were the first spacecraft built to
orbit another planet. Mariner 8 was to have
conducted a broad mapping mission while Mariner 9
was to have made repeated studies of six selected
areas to note atmospheric surface and seasonal
changes. Each was equipped with two television
cameras and several sensors.
The information could determine if conditions
exist on Mars in which some primitive form of life,
such as microbes or plants could exist.
Big Walk For Hungry
As many as four million persons from statesmen to
hippies and children trekked miles for dollars
yesterday in the first "international walk for
development." The money went to feed the world's
hungry.
Marchers in 600 cities of 50 countries covered at
least 10 million miles. In some cities, such as Accra in
Ghana, the walking began Friday.
Hundreds of thousands most of them young
marched yesterday in cities across the United States.
Spokesmen said more than 487,000 Americans
walked in 92 communities yesterday compared with
another 150,000 who turned out in 113 towns and
cities Saturday.
Suicide Protest
SAIGON — A young Buddhist monk burned himself
to death in Hue yesterday in protest against the
Vietnam war. He left behind letters asking President
Nixon and President Nguyen Van Thieu to work for
peace.
In other developments a water taxi crowded with
civilians headed for market hit two floating mines in a
river near the demilitarized zone yesterday, killing at
least 30 Vietnamese.
Dollar Weakened In Europe
Four strong-currency nations in Western Europe,
beset by inflation they blame on a glut of U.S.
dollars, made their money worth more yesterday in
comparison with American currency.
Switzerland revalued its franc upward by 7
percent. It was the strongest move against the dollar,
which has been weakened by years of U.S. balance of
payments deficits.
Austria boosted its schilling by 5.05 percent,
making the dollar worth only 24.75 schillings against
26 previously.
West Germany's Cabinet decided to float the mark
on world markets which is expected to increase its
value in relation to the dollar.
The Netherlands followed the German lead,
deciding to let the guilder float.
France and Italy said they were not interested in
floating their currencies because they have no dollar
problems.
Rogers Returns
WASHINGTON — Secretary of State William P.
Rogers returned from his two-week, Mideast
peace-seeking mission last night, saying there has been
some narrowing of differences between Arabs and
Israelis.
Rogers told newsmen upon his arrival at Andrews
Air Force Base:
"I think the difference between the parties has
narrowed some and I think both sides generally
would like to move toward peace."
An Egyptian spokesman said after the meeting
between Assistant Secretary of State Joseph Sisco
and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, "There is no
change in the situation . . . the differences continue
to be great between the Egyptian and Israeli views."
All in all, Rogers said, "I am somewhat more
encouraged" about the Mideast situation than when
he left on the 18,000 mile trip.

Rogers' mission in the last two weeks focused
particularly on the possibilities of an Egyptian-Israeli
deal to reopen the Suez Canal as a first step toward a
general Mideast settlement.
Laird Looks Past Vietnam
WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Melvin R. Laird
said yesterday the United States should focus its
attention now on what happens after Vietnam and
what is needed to counter Russia's growing
momentum.
It is time, he said, to shift the dialogue from "why
vietnamization" to "beyond Vietnam" and to focus
on "what's in store for us, from the national security
standpoint beyond Vietnam."
Laird also indicated his lack of enthusiasm for
lifting trade restrictions with Red China.
The Secretary said that while the United States has
been tied down in Southeast Asia since 1965 Russia
has been able to use its defense resources to attain a
position of "more or less parity in the strategic
nuclear weapons area" and at the same time has gone
forward with naval modernization and ground force
modernization. Russia, he said has a "tremendous
weapons momentum."
Mars Shot Fails
CAPE KENNEDY,FIa. — "We're heartbroken," a
space agency official said yesterday as investigators
sought a reason for the failure of the Mariner 8 Mars
shot and crews prepared a twin craft, Mariner 9, for
launching May 18.
Mariner 9 could be delayed, depending on what
the investigation turns up.
The first half of the $53.6 million project to orbit
Mars with two satellites failed Saturday night less
than five minutes after liftoff. The second stage of
the Atlas-Centaur rocker tumbled out of control 92
