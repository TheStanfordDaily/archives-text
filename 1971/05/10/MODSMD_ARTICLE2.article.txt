# Lyman, Profs Buy Bond
## Bazile Named In Warrant 
### JONATHON DEDMON 
Authorities are seeking black
student leader and former BSU
co-chairman Leo Bazile in connection
with the beating of a Stanford Hospital
worker early last week.
Bazile's attorney, Thelton
Henderson, said last night that
arrangements have been made with the
District Attorney's office for the
veteran campus political figure to turn
himself in when he returns to
California.
Bazile is currently in Washington
attending a black political science
conference. Neither Henderson nor
Bazile's wife knew when he would
return.
In the wake of the warrant for the
well known black spokesman's arrest, a
group of 25 persons including President
Lyman and Republican presidential
hopeful Rep. Pete McCloskey has raised
money to buy a bond for Bazile's
release after he is taken into custody.
The group also includes Provost
William Miller; Edward Ginston,
Chairman of the Board of Varian
Associates; Environmentalist Paul
Ehrlich; Ira Hall, a Stanford Trustee;
and Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
SLAC.
Bazile is charged with assault to do
great bodily injury and burglary, both
felonies.
Chris Laury, a member of the Black
Liberation Front (BLF) active in the
recent worker grievance controversy at
the hospital, was arrested Friday night
in connection with the same incident in
which Mary Jane Schmidt, a medical
records clerk, was assaulted in her East
Palo Alto apartment last Sunday
evening, May 2.
Laury is being held on $12,500 bail
and faces arraignment at 2:00 p.m. in
Redwood City today.
Commenting on the charges against
Bazile, BSU Chairman Willie Newberry

said, yesterday"The warrants and
charges are the most obvious example
of how white racist elements in the
Stanford Community are trying to
victimize any able black spokesman by
any means possible."
ASSU Senate Chairman Mike
Dawson said last night that the charges
against Bazile were "ludicrous," adding
that Schmidt had originally identified
her assailants as 5'7" and 6'2" whereas
both Bazile and Laury were over six
feet.
Mrs. Bazile has meanwhile stated
that she thinks her husband was at
home the Sunday night in question,
working on a radio show.
The Daily was told last night that
Laury also has an alibi.
President Lyman said last night,
"The news astounded me. From what I
know of Leo it seems to me extremely
unlikely he would be involved in such a
thing."
The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday Schmidt had identified Bazile
and Laury as her assailants from
enlargements of photographs taken at
the hospital sit-in of April 9 which
police broke up, arresting 23 persons.
Schmidt has told authorities that on
the night of May 2, at 9:30 p.m., two
black men forced their way into her
apartment at 1941Cooley Ave. in East
PaJo Alto. r-
She said that the taller of the two
men held her arms while the other
burned her face near her eye with a
cigarette lighter and that when she fell
to the floor, she was kicked in the
abdomen.
The two men supposedly told her
that the attack was for her going to
work when a walkoff had been called at
the hospital in support of 11 minority
demands including the rehiring of fired
black janitor, Sam Bridges.
She was admitted to Stanford
Hospital Monday morning and treated
for a fractured rib and internal

bleeding. She was subsequently released
and her whereabouts since have not been
made public. A resident in her
apartment building said she moved out
at 6:30 a.m. yesterday.
In explaining why the bond fund
was established for Bazile only, and not
for Laury, who is faced with the same
charges, Lyman said yesterday, "These
are all people who know Leo. I don't
personally know Chris Laury."
Laury was arrested at 5:00 p.m.
Friday evening in front of his home at
1800 Stevens Ave. in East Palo Alto.
Police outside called Laury's name.
He came out and offered no resistance
but told the officers that people inside
knew they were there and had "taken
measures to protest themselves."
Bazile is currently facing trial on
charges stemming from his arrest in
connection with the April 9 sit-in.
The persons who collected the
money for Bazile's bond are listed
below. A bond usually costs 10 percent
of the bail set and is not refunded even
if the party who is released with a bond
is subsequently innocent.
