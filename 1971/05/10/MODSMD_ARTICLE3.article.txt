# Hospital Staff Denies Link Mayfield Death & Boycott Threats
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Hospital personnel see no
connection between the death last
week of maintenance man James
Mayfield and threats made against
employees during the workers' boycott
at the Medical Center.
Early reports linked Mayfield's
death with about 18 other threats made
against persons in connection with the
boycott. Mayfield died one week ago of
a heart attack.
Information obtained this weekend
indicates that this analysis was hasty
and probably erroneous.
Hospital employees explained that
Mayfield was not a particularly healthy
man and that they were not surprised
to hear that he had suffered a heart
attack. They said "Big Jim" weighed
over 300 lbs., and that the middle-aged
worker was home on sick leave the
week before his death.
When asked about a possible cause
for Mayfield's absence, a co-worker
reportedly said, "Big Jim is a very, very
sick man."
Mayfield suffered a fatal heart
attack while at work. His job as refuse
compactor included the lifting of heavy
objects. The job description for his
replacement reads in part," . . . must be
physically able to lift weights in excess
of 100 lbs. . . assist in the transport or
installation of heavy or bulky objects.
In view of this, many hospital
employees feel that a search for
possible causes of Mayfield's heart
failure is unnecessary. Don Stuedeman,
a hospital administrator, commented,
"So his supervisor is quoted as saying
that telephone threats could have
contributed to his death. For that

matter, a sneeze could have done the
same thing."
Out Of Context
Mayfield's immediate supervisor
Warren Thorpe, feels that he was
quoted out of context by the initial
newspaper accounts which quoted him
as suggesting a connection between the
threats and Mayfield's death. However,
Vicki Graham, the Palo Alto Times
reporter who interviewed Thorpe, said,
"I'm quite sure the quote was
accurate."
Also the hospital has not sought to
connect Mayfield's death with the
attempted work slowdown. Spyros
Andreopoulos, director of the Medical
School News Service said, "The
hospital has no comment other than
that he died of a heart attack."
A file compiling alleged acts of
intimidation of hospital workers also
may have been overdramatized.
According to the hospital, the reports
are being kept confidential merely to
protect the employees themselves.
"There is no 'secret report' " states

Andreopoulos. "The quote about 18
specific incidences of intimidation
stems from a speech made by
University Provost Miller to the faculty
Senate."
Threats
The reports apparently range from
telephone calls to workers' homes
warning that their cars will be bombed
to verbal threats against those who
crossed picket lines.
James Siena, legal advisor to
President Lyman, said that while his
office is exploring the possibilities of
legal action, such recourses are very
tentative at this time. One obvious
problem concerns identification of
those making the phone calls.
Some hospital workers counter these
charges of intimidation with others of
their own. "What about administrative
intimidation?" asked one employee at
the Medical Center computer complex.
"Employees are afraid to talk about
the boycott in front of their bosses and
supervisors. They're afraid for their
jobs. That kind of intimidation never
gets into the newspapers," he added.

OOPSâ€”WeII, some you make, some you don't. Evidently some Le Mans driver (retired) tried to make this corner by Hoskins
Saturday afternoon and ended up treating bypassers to a spectacular re-creation of Old Faithful.
