## Hunger Strike For Adequate Housing 
###

Dave Walker has been on a
hunger strike since Easter Sunday.
He's been fasting for 28 days to
protest and draw attention to the
lack of adequate housing for
low-income residents of San
Mateo County. A poster in front
of the tent where Dave is now
living states, "I'm hungry for
low-income housing." The 45,000
residents of San Mateo who live
below or near the poverty line in
the third richest county in the
United States understand it.
San Mateo Welfare Department
estimates a family of three living
in San Mateo needs $245 a month
to get by (provided they don't
own a car or have any bills.) They
can only allocate $163.- The
cheapest, unfurnished, one
bedroom apartments in San Mateo
rent for $105 a month. The
average price is closer to $130.
Money that should go for food
and clothing is paid out in rent.
The cost to buy housing in San
Mateo is among the highest in the
nation. It is impossible for
families with an income below
$10,000 a year to buy
homes—forcing low income
workers and welfare recipients to

compete for the limited amount
of low cost housing that is
available, and causing
overcrowding in Southeast
Redwood City, East Menlo Park,
and East Palo Alto where the only
"low income" housing (average
rent for a two bedroom house in
these areas is $160 a month) is
available. The result has been
almost total economic segregation
into "poverty pockets."
For the past four years, low
income people in San Mateo have
been trying-through petitions and
appeals; by submitting proposals
and attending conferences; by
marching and sitting in—to get the
Board of Supervisors and Housing
Authority of San Mateo County
to acknowledge and begin to solve
the problem of inadequate
housing for low income people.
Dave Walker, director of
Project Focus, a multi-racial, low
income self-help group in
Redwood City, has been working
to get low income housing into
San Mateo over the past four
years. He decided to take his
dramatic approach on the
Thursday before Easter because
two members of Focus came to
his home and said they were
about to be evicted from their
homes and asked for help. In his
words.

"What the hell could I do? I
took down the information, but I
knew all I could do was go
through the motions.
"There are people living in
garages everywhere down here.
It's very bad. We asked the county
to provide more housing, but they
can't or won't do anything, so it's
time for us to do it ourselves."
As an alternative to the
previous lack of action by the
county's elected officials, Dave,
along with Ed Becks, the county
director of the Economic
Opportunity Commission and
Cliff Boxly, the director of the
Probe Community Center in
Redwood City, have started a
Poor People's Housing Campaign,
as a non-profit corporation aimed
at securing funds through
donations; to build
housing in the county; and as a
way of getting around the current
federal law which prohibits the
building of federally-financed, low
income housing without approval,
by vote, of the county's residents
(this law was recently upheld by
the U.S. Supreme Court and has
been a major obstacle to securing
low income housing in counties
like San Mateo, which are
controlled by well organized,
affluent majorities.)

The housing can be built by
private contractors or
corporations, but over the past 15
years contractors have found
larger and faster profits can be
made by building high cost luxury
apartments and condominiums.
Monday Ed Becks, the head of
E.0.C., joined Dave on his hunger
strike. They will continue to fast
until they see substantial
commitments by the county
officials concerning low income
housing or have to be taken to the
hospital for malnutrition.
Between that time it is their
intention to make as many people
as possible aware of the problem
and get people involved in
working towards a solution.
According to Dave, "People
helping people is the whole thing.
We'd like to see everybody, all
kinds of people working together
on this. We welcome people who
want to help."
Progress has already been made
since Dave started his fast—one of
the major obstacles, lack of
awareness on the part of the
affluent majority of San Mateo is
being overcome; one contractor
has expressed interest in building
the housing; the officials are
forming committees and
proposing redevelopment; the
local newspapers are running
analyses of the problem.
But much work needs to be
done and more help is needed to
turn awareness into commitment.
Dave's living in a tent on the lawn
of the Unitarian Fellowship
Church in Redwood City (2124
Brewster Ave.) He will take time
to explain what he's doing and
what other people can do to
anyone or any group that goes to
see him.
