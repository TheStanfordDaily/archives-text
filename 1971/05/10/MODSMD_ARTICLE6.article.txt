# Inspired Runners Edge Cal

### 
Don Kardong rounded the final
turn of the 2 -mile's anchor lap
and slowed till teammate Arvid
Kretz caught up. Seconds later the
pair snapped the tape, Kardong
leaping triumphantly into the
air- Stanford's upset victory over
Cal in the 75 th annual Big Meet
was sealed.
It almost seemed too easy, that
the Indians should have so little
difficulty defeating the Golden
Bears, a team which had come
within two points of the nation's
best dual-meet squad, UCLA.
Easy, perhaps, but in final analysis
a well-engineered triumph.
Victory stipulated that
Stanford's stars all had to win; so
they did, dealing a 1-2 punch in
the 88 0 and mile.
Rick Tipton took the highs
(14.2); Randy White the
intermediates (51.0); Don
Kardong the mile and 2-mile
(4:03.3 and 8:56.6); Allen
Meredith the triple jump
(49'-l I");Casey Carrigan the pole
vault (15'-6"); and Chuck Francis
the springs (9.6 and 21.3) as well
as providing the margin of victory
in the 44 0 -Relay (41.0).
Their teammates' seconds and
thirds made the triumph possible.
Pete Fairchild won the 88 0
(1:52.2) with Tim Nicholson
second.

Ken Curl took thirds in the
100 and 220 , Duncan Mac-Donald
a second in the mile, Todd
Peterson second in the pole vault,
Tom Anderson thirds in the long

jump and high jump, Steve Davis a
second in the shot (with a lifetime
best) and a third in the discus.
Tom Long a third in the highs and
Jim Kauffman a third in the 4 40.


ALL-STAR TACKLEâ€”Stanford tackle Dave Tipton (76), shown here

the College All-Star team Saturday along with Jim Plunkett and Bob
Moore.
