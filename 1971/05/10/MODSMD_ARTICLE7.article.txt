# Crew Beats Bears
## 
### 
The Stanford Crew put
together five skillful races
yesterday on calm water in the
Oakland Estuary yesterday and
came away with shirts from three
of the five competing Cal
Berkeley boats.
The Varsity eight-oared shell,
which had endured some tough
losses at mid-season, clinched the
Jim Reynolds trophy and left the
Cal oarsmen a toat-length and a
half in their wake, winning in a
time of 6:26.7 to 6:31.8.
After dropping behind at the
start, the J.V. boat at first kept
Cal from stretching their lead, but
at the finish lost by about two
lengths 6:35.8 to 6:42.7.
The first races by two
freshman boats seemed to forecast
a clean sweep of the meet. The
first Frosh, rowing with what
their coach called "a good amount
of skill," won their race handily
6:26.1 to 6:36.6. The Cal
lightweight and second frosh
boats finished in a dead heat, just
10.5 seconds later than Stanford's
second Frosh.
Coach Dick Herzog, when
asked what he thought of the
day's races, assumed success did

not need an explanation. "What
did you think of them?" he asked.
In two weeks the crew travels
to Seattle, where it will compete
with about 15 other schools in the
Western Sprints.
