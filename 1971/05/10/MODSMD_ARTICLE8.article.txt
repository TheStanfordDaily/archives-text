# Indians Lose Ground In Conference Battle
## 
### 
The Indians were dealt a
critical, but not fatal, blow this
weekend in their drive for the
second spot in the PAC-8 baseball
race. Though Stanford split with
Oregon State on Friday, losing the
first game 4-3, and winning the
nightcap, 16-7, and then swept
Oregon on Saturday, 11-1, and
6-4, the Indians fell a game behind
UCLA in the standings.
UCLA won four games from
Washington and Washington State
and upped its record to 11-4.
Stanford stands at 9-6, two games
behind the Bruins. Next weekend
will hold the key to both the
Indians' and Bruins' hopes.
Stanford has to take two games
from Cal while UCLA must crop a
pair to USC, a not totally unlikely

event. USC has walked over
everyone this season en route to a
perfect 15-0 league record. If
events fall into place for the
Indians, they will tie UCLA for
second place in which case
Stanford would get the nod for
the playoffs since it holds the
edge in the season series with the
Bruins.
Stanford would have been in
much better shape if it had not
allowed three unearned runs in
the first game Friday. Combined
with the 12 runners left on base
by the Indians, the mistake meant
a squeaky 4-3 Oregon victory.
On Friday, Rod Boone went a
offensive spree with five hits and
four RBl's, breaking the Stanford
single season record and pushing
his total to 45 for the year.
