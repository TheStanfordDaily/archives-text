Today In The 'Daily'
Our counterparts 21 years ago were nothing if not perceptive. On
that date, the intrepid Stanford debating team took on Cat over the
issue 'Resolved: that capitalism is doomed.' The record does not show
who won ■ Stanford, Cat, or capitalism.
If you see any doomed capitalists walking around, you could ask
them if they are, with whom they are insured, or you could refer
them to our news desk at x 4632. Our business office is not doomed
(not yet, anyway) and acts as a haven for practicing capitalists at
3214750.
No staff lunch today, but many goodies at noon tomorrow.
