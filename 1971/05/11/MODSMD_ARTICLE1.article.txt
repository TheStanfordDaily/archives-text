# Council Vote Will Shape Future Growth
## 
### KIM McCALL 
In one of the most important
elections in the City's history, the
voters of Palo Alto will go to the polls
today to elect four new members to the
City Council. In effect, they will be
given the opportunity to chose between
allowing continued commercial
expansion and limiting the growth of
the City's emerging financial-industrial
sector.
The City Council election is usually
understood to revolve around the issues
of "overdevelopment" and the
economic health of the city.
For the last two years the Council
has consisted of eleven seats, but this
number is being reduced to nine: six
Council terms expired this year, but
only four seats are to be filled.
Also on the ballot is a chance for the
voter to express his feelings about the
administration's handling of the
Vietnam War. He may vote for either of
two choices:
—"I am satisfied with the policies of
the present administration in its
handling of the withdrawal of the
United States armed forces from the
conflict in Southeast Asia."
—"I prefer a greatly accelerated
program of withdrawal and request that
the President and the Congress remove
all United States armed forces from
Southeast Asia by December 31,
1971."

There are thirteen candidates
seeking election to the four Council
posts. These have grouped themselves
into two slates of four each and five
"independents."
Two Slates
One slate (John Armstrong, Frances
Dias, Frank Gallagher, and Philip
Lexey) has been endorsed by the
"establishment" Palo Altans for
Responsible Government —(PARG).
The other slate is endorsed by the
Association for a Balanced Community
(ABC), which represents the more
liberal "residential" viewpoint. It
consists of Alan Henderson, Enid
Pearson, Richard Rosenbaum, and
Sylvia Seman.
The independents include Roberta
Cane, Jerry Franks, Elvia Garwood,
Jean Hobson, and Gregory Kerber.
Issues in the election range from
"U.S. imperialism" to "commune"
living groups. Somewhere in between
are emphasized the Willow Expressway,
crime in the streets, conservation, and
preservation of the foothills.
The PARG establishment slate
reflects the present City Council
majority. It favors increased
development and continuation of the
trend toward making Palo Alto a
financial center for the mid-peninsula.
In their campaign, members have
emphasized their responsibility and

dedication. They have focused on the
issues of public safety, continued
development, and preservation of the
city's current residential and economic
character.
Armstrong, a West Point graduate
and retired Army lieutenant colonel,
has chosen as his campaign slogan the
slightly ambiguous "Palo Alto needs to
establish priorities." He says if elected
he will be "open-minded and
strai gh t-f orward."
Mrs. Dias, a 10-year veteran of the
Council, stresses her past achievements
and the necessity of continued
enforcement of laws protecting "the
integrity of residential neighborhoods."
Goals For the City
The prime thrust of Gallagher's
campaign has been a program called
Goals for Palo Alto, which would seek
to insure that all voices within the
community were heard. Gallagher has
served four years on the Council, and
this program was adopted two weeks
ago.
Lexey seems to consider his primary
selling point the fact that he is a
NATIVE PALO ALTAN (capitals not
added). He has stated that because he is
30 years old and has slightly longish
hair, he can communicate with the
youth of Palo Alto.
He places particular emphasis on the
hard drug problem, and says, "Vote
with me to 'Save Our City' and recreate

a 'City of Reality.'" He invites hjs
supporters to send contributions to the
"Save Our City Committee."
The liberal ABC slate has taken a
stand against development, including
"Superblock" and the Willow
Expressway, both of which have been
supported by the present Council. All
are opposed to the war and stress the
need for "low-moderate" income
housing.
Henderson, who has been active in
Common Cause and in other liberal
groups, opposes Stanford's new
land-use proposals, and says, "Progress
must be redefined in terms of the
quality of life and meeting the needs of
all the people."
Mrs. Pearson, a six-year Council
veteran, says,"The goals and aims of
the entire world are changing, and we
must be responsive to this change."
Rosenbaum was founder and
chairman of the Citizens Committee to
Block the Superblock. He stresses
environmental and social needs, and
says,"The time has come to realize
that Palo Alto cannot grow forever."
Residential View
Mrs. Seman has been active in
numerous social and civic groups (she
was President of the League of Women
Voters from 1967 to 1969), and wants
to make Palo Alto a "community and
not a commercial industrial center."
The "independents" all side with the

ABC slate concerning fear of
overdevelopment and the need for low
cost housing. Roberta Cane, a
soft-spoken but dynamic candidate, is
endorsed by the Palo Alto Tenants
Union (PATU). She has both a B.A.
and an M.A. from Stanford. She
actively opposed the Superblock and
other development projects. She has
prepared detailed position papers on
development, Stanford land use, tenant
issues, Palo Alto and the War in
Vietnam, and women's issues.
Mrs. Cane favors neighborhood
control of development, and the
formation of decision-making
organizations on a neighborhood level.
She says, "Social unrest is no accidnet.
It develops from frustration and the
abuse of power."
Franks graduated from Stanford,
and was active in both the Stu McLean
and anti-Superblock campaigns. He sees
Palo Alto following in the footsteps of
her "sister cities," Newark and New
York. He said at a forum at Gunn High
School that he had entered the Council
race to offer a third alternative to the
two slates. Although he felt at first that
this choice should be "between" the
two slates, he said he felt after the
campaign that it should belong "over
with Mrs. Cane."
Mrs. Garwood, an architecture
graduate, is especially concerned with
ecological and planning issues. She

views herself as an advocate of the
individual before the Council.
Overdevelopment
Mrs. Hobson is a member of
Venceremos and PATU, and took part
in the 1968 Poor Peoples March. Her
campaign's central argument has been
the "connections" between
overdevelopment in Palo Alto,
repression at Stanford, and the war in
Indo-china. She has also endorsed Mrs.
Cane.
The fifth independent candidate is
an unemployed, long-haired, volunteer
junior varsity tennis coach at Stanford,
Gregory Kerber, at 27 the youngest
candidate. Upset by the current trend
toward "deterioration" of the
community, Kerber has used his
candidacy as a means of pointing to the
major issues and an opportunity to
criticize the candidates who represent
the Council majority.
He says little about himself, and in
fact recently said he would prefer that
people vote for Mrs. Cane. He
emphasizes the issues of mass transit,
recycling, and child care centers.
In order for those opposed to the
current trend toward development to
secure a clear majority, they will have
to capture all four seats in today's
election, as Kirke Comstock is the only
current Council member backing their
effort.
