# 'Sequoia' Offers Good Reading
## 
### JOSEPH DELVALLE 
The Spring issue of the
"Sequoia" is out and it is the
third bundle of good reading to
appear under that title this year.
Literary magazines at their best
can be instant anthologies, and at
their worst trite and embarassing.
"Sequoia" is somewhere in
between. Many accomplished
writers have appeared in
"Sequoia," although it consists
mostly of writing by students who
have yet to be published
elsewhere.
This issue's "accomplished
writer" is Thom Gunn, who has
had four books of poetry
published and has appeared in
numerous anthologies. His poem
"Baby Song" consists of seven
rhymed couplets which comprise

a witty poem that in a sense
synthesizes the mood of the
magazine.
There is a general tone to this
issue, but it is very difficult to
describe. A good example of it is
the first story, "The Train" by
John Lopez, only a page long,
which is like a dream in its
vividness and apparent simplicity.
"Panic," a poem by Valery
Clappison, is more like a
nightmare, as is "Letter from
Vietnam" by Tim Gillespie, which
is an anti-war poem that somehow
avoids cliches.
However, there is another side
to the writing. Jim Feuerstein's
"Graham, Lucy, and the CIA
Agent" is a story about three
people, one of whom (Roger
Kloetsche) is convinced that he is

a CIA agent and spies on the other
two (Graham and Lucy). Most of
the time Graham and Luch play
frisbee. Not very subversive, but
funny.
Tony Olcott's "How Accessible
Ether!" is a satirical look at
graduate school, dissertations, and
academic life in general. It is the
story of Arthur Glen Longwood
who writes his dissertation on
Arthur Long Glenwood, who was
"one of the very few American
poets to consider himself a
Romantic."
Asa whole the magazine is more
than good reading. The price
(75cents) is a little steep, but it's a
lot cheaper than a movie in Palo
Alto or on campus. It is on sale in
White Plaza.
