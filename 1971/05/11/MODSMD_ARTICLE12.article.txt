# Free School Programs Under Consideration

### 
"There is an anti-life process going
on in public education. In public
schools numbers (of students) is only
one of the problems, there is also the
matter of values. The public school
system assumes a student, left on his
own, will do the wrong thing. There is a
distrust that is expressed in terms of
grades and compulsory attendance.
"Alternative education says that if
you give a person space and time he
will self-correct. He will do what is
right for himself and those around him
through learning," said Ron Bolek,
Stanford intern teaching at Cubberly
High School and full-time staff member
at Lothlorien (Alternative) High School
in Palo Alto.
Alternative systems of education are
topics of continuing SWOPSI courses
involving students and members of
several surrounding communities with
Lothlorien, student-run Tree High
School, the Ravenswood Pre school and
the community-run Children's Center
on campus.
Participants in the SWOPSI courses
receive academic credit for doing
volunteer work at the alternative
education facilities and discussing their
experiences at weekly seminars. Course
loader, Margot McNeil, emphasized that
"volunteers are not student teachers in
someone else's classroom. They are
acting creatively on their own iniative
and working with administrators."
Tuesday May 11, at 7:30 p.m. there
will be a meeting at the Toddler's
Center on Santa Ynez, between
Salvatierra and Mayfield to discuss the
future of these programs.

McNeil pointed to President Nixon's
Conference on Children as evidence of
growing awareness in the area of
alternative education, but noted that
the "early infant socialization" taking
place at the Toddler's Center is almost
unheard of in the U.S. although it can
be found on Israel's kibbutzim and in
the Soviet Union. "Here the concept
of the nuclear family colors
education."
The Drop-In (Toddler) Center at
Stanford provides parents with a place
to leave their children while they are at
work. A center which is just being
organized in the Chicano community
will similarly benefit both parents and
children.
The alternative educational
programs for pre-schoolers through
high school students are "challenging
some text-book notions about
learning," said Mrs. McNeil, "and
people are seriously questioning the
value of requiring students to digest a
specific body of material before they
can leave."
Bolek said that about one-third of
Lothlorien's 35 students were at the
top of their class in public school but
were frustrated by the arbitrariness.
They came to Lothlorien looking for
total learning; where "academics is only
one of the things we do."
"If a student wants to learn about
photography or wheels it's up to the
staff to find someone to teach him,"
said Mr. McNeil. "The faculty is anyone
who knows something about anything
and wants to share whatever the
students are interested in. It becomes a
course."
