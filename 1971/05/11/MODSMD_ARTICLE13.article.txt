# Reagan Hits 'New' Criminals
## 
### 
Citing the burning of Junipero
House here as his example, Governor
Ronald Reagan declared yesterday that
there is "a new kind of crime
threatening California and the United
States."
This 'new kind of crime' is being
"plotted and carried out by a new
breed of criminal," Reagan stated. He
characterized the criminal as "the
self-proclaimed revolutionary who
directs senseless acts of violence against
innocent bystanders." Reagan made the
remarks before a meeting of members
of the California Peace Officers
Association.
"An arsonist - sneaking through the
dead of night - deliberately set the fire
that destroyed the lounge of a
dormitory," the governor said. "The
flames and smoke drove 80 people
from their beds."
Reagan went on to cite the words of
Nate Mc√üride, the freshman who
discovered the 3:30 a.m. fire which
gutted Junipero lounge two weeks ago.
"After the fire was put out," Reagan
commented, "one student remarked
that this particular act of violence was -
in his words 'far different from setting
a truck or a motorcycle on fire. If one
of us had not seen it, a lot of us would
be dead. That is not vandalism; that's
murder.' "That student is right in one
sense," the governor continued. "If
someone had been killed it would have
been murder. But setting fire in a
dormitory is no different from setting a
truck or motorcycle on fire. Vandalism,
arson, and murder are all illegal acts of

violence. And they differ only in
degree."
Reagan went on to decry the
inability of people to perceive "that
simple truth." He called this inability
"the tragic dilemma of our times.
"Crimes cannot be divided into just
and unjust categories. Violence cannot
be explained or excused by any real or
imagined grievance."
"What makes these new criminals
double dangerous, is their fanaticism
which makes them perform with an
almost religious zeal, as if they were
ordained by a higher power to right all
the ills of mankind," Reagan noted.
