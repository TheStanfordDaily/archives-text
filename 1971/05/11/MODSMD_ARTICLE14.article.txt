# Convocation Planned

A convocation planned by the Black
Students' Union(BSU)on "institutional
racism, imperialism, and political
victimization," will begin today with a
noon rally on White Plaza.
The convocation is scheduled to end
Friday with a plebiscite of the Stanford
community on these issues.
BSU chairman Willie Newberry said
yesterday,"the convocation and
plebiscite result from our discovery
that there is pervasive and serious
ignorance over what these issues really
are and how they function inside the
Stanford community."
Daily general assemblies on White
Plaza will be held every day this week
at 12:30 p.m. preceded by one
half-hour of "Black Expressions."

Speakers scheduled for the week
include Leo Bazile, former BSU
chairman, St. Clair Drake, professor of
anthropology and sociology and head
of the Black Studies Program, and
Robert McAfee Brown, professor of
religion.
Convocation classes will be held
throughout the week, and next
Thursday will be highlighted by three
symposia on institutional racism, one
for the entire white community, one
for the black community here, and one
for all faculty members.
An important purpose of the
convocation is to explain the recently
issued BSU demands, says co-Chairman
Michael Dawson, "We hope the white
community comes," he added.
White ignorance towards the issue of
racism, says Newberry, "has resulted in
a complete incomprehension of the
signifigance of our demands, a lack of
seriousness in trying tonegotiate them,
and a general toleration of white racist
forces by the Stanford community."
The plebiscite of faculty, staff, and
students calls for a vote on whether
they "wish to take a stand against
institutional racism, imperialism, and
political victimization by recognizing
the Black reperation demands as
appropriate initial steps to that end,"
says Newberry.
A second measure asks whether the
Stanford Community is "willing to take
a stand against victimization of black
spokesmen and supporters by using
every means at their disposal to insure
that none of them are imprisoned,
expelled, or suspended," according to
Newberry.
