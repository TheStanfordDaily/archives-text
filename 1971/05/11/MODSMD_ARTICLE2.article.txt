# Sheriff Assumes Campus Duties
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department increased its patrols here
yesterday and has taken over more
responsibility for on-campus law
enforcement.
Evidently, the Sheriff's Department
will take over investigating most
misdemeanors, including petty thefts
(except bicycles) that the Stanford
Police Department had been handling.
Sheriffs Deputies will continue to
investigate all felonies.
The Palo Alto Times yesterday
reported that the Sheriffs department
has "assumed all law enforcement
activities" on campus. According to
Sheriff's Sgt. Don Tamm, a community
relations officer, the Sheriff's
Department has always had control
over law enforcement at Stanford and
has "merely increased the number of
men assigned to that area [Stanford]."
Tamm, however, did say that the
Sheriffs Department "has taken more
responsibility on the campus and
relieved the Stanford Police
Department of the responsibility" for
law enforcement.
The increase in manpower was part
of an increase in the number patrols in
the entire north Santa Clara County
area approved by the Board of
Supervisors last year. Money for the
increased patrols was in the budget that
went into effect in July but the
increased patrols were delayed until
yesterday because the county had to
train the men, according to Tamm.

Bruce Wiggins, University director of
public safety, said it "takes a total
manpower of eight deputy sheriffs" to
maintain anywhere from one to three
or more patrolmen on campus at any
one time. The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday that under the new plan,
"The sheriff will have two full-time
patrol cars on the campus with one
deputy assigned during the day and two
at night."
In addition, a second detective will
be assigned to Stanford full time. There
is currently one working on campus
crime.
The Sheriffs Department informed
the Stanford police last week that its
patrols would be increased this week,
although Stanford has known about the
increased patrols since the budget
increases were approved in the County
budget.
Tamm emphasized yesterday that
the increased patrols are not a drastic
change in policy. "We are the law
enforcement agency for Stanford," he
said. Stanford has had a "pseudo-police
force" in the Stanford Police
Department, he continued, and they
"certainly did things above and beyond
what other security police did."
However, when it was determined
several years ago that Stanford police
were only private patrols and not peace
officers, the "sheriff increased his
patrols" here, Tamm said. Sheriff
James Geary felt "that he should
clarify what responsibility they (the
sheriffs) had," Tamm added.
In the first day of operations, there

was some shifting around and
uncertainty as to the deputies' duties.
Tamm and Wiggins both said that some
details of the new plan have not been
worked out.
In February, the University
increased its security force by 11 foot
patrolmen. Wiggins emphasized that all
recent increases in expenditures for the
Stanford Police Department have been
for security functions only.
Tamm said the Sheriffs increases
were authorized because "we feel there
is a need for service allocated to the
Stanford area" to combat crime.
The University is currently seeking
legislation to give its campus force
peace officer status.

President Richard Lyman said he
was surprised by the article in
yesterday's Palo Alto Times. He said he
had been "saying all along" that the
Sheriff's Department was going to take
more responsibility in law enforcement.
But Lyman is unsure of the effect
the increased patrols will have on the
Stanford Police Department.
The Sheriff's Department has
increased patrols on campus on an
"emergency basis" the last few weeks
in response to the bombing of the
President's office, the Junipero fire,
and the firearms discharge, according to
Wiggins. But yesterday's increases are
permanent ones, Wiggins said.

In addition, a second detective will
be assigned to Stanford full time. There
is currently one working on campus
crime.
The Sheriffs Department informed
the Stanford police last week that its
patrols would be increased this week,
although Stanford has known about the
increased patrols since the budget
increases were approved in the County
budget.
Tamm emphasized yesterday that
the increased patrols are not a drastic
change in policy. "We are the law
enforcement agency for Stanford," he
said. Stanford has had a "pseudo-police
force" in the Stanford Police
Department, he continued, and they
"certainly did things above and beyond
what other security police did."
However, when it was determined
several years ago that Stanford police
were only private patrols and not peace
officers, the "sheriff increased his
patrols" here, Tamm said. Sheriff
James Geary felt "that he should
clarify what responsibility they (the
sheriffs) had," Tamm added.
In the first day of operations, there

was some shifting around and
uncertainty as to the deputies' duties.
Tamm and Wiggins both said that some
details of the new plan have not been
worked out.
In February, the University
increased its security force by 11 foot
patrolmen. Wiggins emphasized that all
recent increases in expenditures for the
Stanford Police Department have been
for security functions only.
Tamm said the Sheriffs increases
were authorized because "we feel there
is a need for service allocated to the
Stanford area" to combat crime.
The University is currently seeking
legislation to give its campus force
peace officer status.

President Richard Lyman said he
was surprised by the article in
yesterday's Palo Alto Times. He said he
had been "saying all along" that the
Sheriff's Department was going to take
more responsibility in law enforcement.
But Lyman is unsure of the effect
the increased patrols will have on the
Stanford Police Department.
The Sheriff's Department has
increased patrols on campus on an
"emergency basis" the last few weeks
in response to the bombing of the
President's office, the Junipero fire,
and the firearms discharge, according to
Wiggins. But yesterday's increases are
permanent ones, Wiggins said.
The Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department increased its patrols here
yesterday and has taken over more
responsibility for on-campus law
enforcement.
Evidently, the Sheriff's Department
will take over investigating most
misdemeanors, including petty thefts
(except bicycles) that the Stanford
Police Department had been handling.
Sheriffs Deputies will continue to
investigate all felonies.
The Palo Alto Times yesterday
reported that the Sheriffs department
has "assumed all law enforcement
activities" on campus. According to
Sheriff's Sgt. Don Tamm, a community
relations officer, the Sheriff's
Department has always had control
over law enforcement at Stanford and
has "merely increased the number of
men assigned to that area [Stanford]."
Tamm, however, did say that the
Sheriffs Department "has taken more
responsibility on the campus and
relieved the Stanford Police
Department of the responsibility" for
law enforcement.
The increase in manpower was part
of an increase in the number patrols in
the entire north Santa Clara County
area approved by the Board of
Supervisors last year. Money for the
increased patrols was in the budget that
went into effect in July but the
increased patrols were delayed until
yesterday because the county had to
train the men, according to Tamm.

Bruce Wiggins, University director of
public safety, said it "takes a total
manpower of eight deputy sheriffs" to
maintain anywhere from one to three
or more patrolmen on campus at any
one time. The Palo Alto Times reported
yesterday that under the new plan,
"The sheriff will have two full-time
patrol cars on the campus with one
deputy assigned during the day and two
at night."
In addition, a second detective will
be assigned to Stanford full time. There
is currently one working on campus
crime.
