# Dollar Gains Slightly
## West German Mark Floats Free 
### 
BONN, Germany (AP) â€” The West
German government decided Sunday to
let the mark seek its own level on
international money markets to stem
the flow of unwanted U.S. dollars.
Chancellor Willy Brandt said in a
nationwide television address the move
did not amount to an upward
revaluation of the mark. That would
make German goods more expensive
and less competitive in world markets.
European Common Market finance
ministers, at an overnight meeting in
Brussels, gave West Germany and other
countries the okay to let their
currencies float.
Ceases Intervention
Karl Schiller, West Germany's
minister of economics, said in a

statement the Central Bank "will cease
its intervention" in behalf of the dollar
on Monday. The Brussels agreement, he
added, was "a compromise for which
we all worked hard."
Schiller emphasized the compromise
was important because it meant there
would be no change of currency parity
within the Common Market and
because it provided for a widening of
the mark fluctuation limit "from which
the cabinet has drawn its conclusions."
No Revaluation
West German spokesmen have
repeatedly said the mark would not be
revalued. This means that the
government would still seek to
maintain the mark at its present dollar
parity but would use the additional

flexibility to ward off heavy dollar
inflows into the country.
There was no immediate official
reaction in Washington.
In New York, Eugene Birnbaum of
Chase Manhattan Bank said it would
take "a little while for the mark to
settle down, but we will be able to
establish a future market."
Birnbaum, vice president in charge
of international monetary affairs at
Chase, said his chief concern now was
that the mark would float too long. A
government spokesman in Bonn said
the mark could remain unpegged for
several months.
Supply and Demand
The West Germans got the green
light to let their currency float from
their partners in the European
Common Market. The market's
economics and finance ministers agreed
to let any currency float at a meeting
that lasted into the early morning hours
of Sunday.
By floating, the mark would respond
to supply and demand. Experts
predicted there would be little change
in the value of the mark.
Under the present set-up, the mark
is pegged at 3.66 to the dollar and the
government is committed to keeping it
within 0.75 percent of that figure.
Currencies of other Western countries
except for Canada, are tied to the same
fluctuation limits.
