# ASSU Overturns Bail Fund Veto
## 
### 
By the exact majority required by
the ASSU constitution, the ASSU
Senate yesterday overrode former
Council of Presidents member Pat C.
Shea's veto of a senate proposal to
transfer $5,000 from the ASSU
underwriting reserve fund to the bail
fund.
Owen Blank, a graduate student at
the Law School, made the proposal to
override the veto and transfer the
money. Former LASSU Speaker Yale
Braunstein made a motion to transfer
the remainder of the underwriting fund
into the Senate's contingency fund, but
later withdrew his motion.
The veto override was passed on a
roll call vote in a special Senate meeting
yesterday afternoon. After the first
round of balloting, the count stood at
18 for, 6 opposed, and 3 abstaining. In
a second round vote, Braunstein and
Lyman Clark switched their votes into
the yea column and Senate Chairman
Mike Dawson cast the deciding vote.
The final tally was 21 in favor, 5
opposed, 1 abstention.
The money will go to replenish the
ASSU bail fund reserve, which now
stands near zero. Money in the reserve
is available to any Stanford student
who is arrested, with the aim of getting

the student out of jail so that he can
repay the interest-free "loan" as soon
as possible. In recent weeks, the ability
of accused students to raise their bail
money has not kept up with the
accelerated demand for bail. Although
the fund is disbursed on a rotating basis
money repaid is made immediately
available for new loan, the reserves
have been decimated by a rise in
student arrests. "We're not sure who
they're going to arrest next, and on
what charges," one senator declared.
Blank explained that the transfer
was not necessarily intended to be a
permanent one: "It was just a loan
from the underwriting fund to the bail
fund, payable on demand to the
Senate ... It's just a bookkeeping thing
at this point."
The fund is under the administration
of Ed Hayes, president of the Law
Students' Association. According to
Hayes, the before the Senate action the
fund reserves were down to $129,
down from a maximum of $3,000.
Hayes said that there had been several
instances in which arrested students'
bail needs could not be covered by the
ASSU fund, but that in each case bail
had eventually been arranged for with
the aid of other legal-aid organizations.
