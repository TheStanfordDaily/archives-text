# Bazile To Turn Himself In Today
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Leo Bazile, former Black Students
Union Chairman, will surrender himself
to the San Mateo County District
Attorney this morning, his lawyer
announced yesterday.
Bazile is sought on charges of assault
with a deadly weapon in connection
with the beating of Mary Jane Schmidt,
a Stanford Hospital employee. Schmidt
is alleged to have identified Bazile and
Christopher Laury, another black, from
photographs.
Thelton Henderson, a Law School
faculty member, stated that Bazile
returned from Washington, D.C.

Sunday night and would surrender to
the District Attorney in Redwood City
late this morning.
No Knowledge
"Leo denies any knowledge of the
incident," stated Henderson yesterday
afternoon. "He was shocked when he
heard about the warrant for his arrest.
The first knowledge he had of it was
when he returned from Washington."
Bazile was attending a conference
for black political science students at
Howard University in Washington.
When contacted at his home in
Escondido Village last night, he had no
comment on the charges against him.
"I don't wish to say anything until
after things have been squared away
and I've surrendered," he stated.
The black student activist also faces
misdemeanor charges of failure to

disperse and interference with a police
officer in performance of his duty.
These lesser charges stem from the
April 9 Medical Center sit-in.
Laury Arrested At Home
Laury, a member of the Black
Liberation Front and a negotiator in
the worker grievance controversy at the
hospital, was arrested in front of his
home Friday evening. Bail was initially
set at $12,500, but was reduced at his
arraignment yesterday to $6250.
Although the reduced bail was
obtained, Laury's release was delayed
due to a misunderstanding about how
the bail should be paid. The Sheriff's
Office refused a cashiers check for
$3000, stating that a rule instituted two
months ago prohibited it. Laury was
finally released around 8:00 p.m.
yesterday.

Money for a bond to obtain Bazile's
release after he is taken into custody
was raised by 25 persons, including
University President Richard Lyman
and Republican Congressman Pete
McCloskey.
As of yesterday, Schmidt had not
yet returned to her job in Medical
Records at the hospital. Her superior
stated that she knew neither Schmidt's
whereabouts nor whether she planned
to return to work.
Schmidt Moved
Schmidt has apparently moved from
her apartment at 1941 Cooley Ave. in
East Palo Alto, where the assault is
alleged to have occured.
Captain Elvander of the San Mateo
County Sheriffs Office would not
comment on the procedure through
