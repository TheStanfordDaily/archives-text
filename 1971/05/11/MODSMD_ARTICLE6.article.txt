# Court To Hear Sexism Case
## 
### WALLY THURSTON 
The issue of sex discrimination
at Stanford may get its first
hearing this morning when Judge
John H. Mclnerny is scheduled to
preside over the Cross vs. Stanford
case at the Santa Clara Superior
Court, 270 Grant Ave. Palo Alto.
Plaintiffs Dr. Nancy Cross and
Linda Crouse, a Stanford
employee, will move that the
Court file a preliminary injunction
to stop Stanford's "racist-sexist
policies" in admission and
employment.
Deans Subpoenaed
Among the witnesses the
plaintiffs subpoenaed to testify
are Bernard W. Nelson, Dean of
Graduate Studies; and Fred A.
Hargadon, Dean of Undergraduate
Admissions.
The hearing had been
scheduled for last Friday, but was
postponed until today after
Stanford lawyers filed a demurrer,
claiming that there was no cause
for action against the University
in this case. They also moved to
quash the plaintiffs subpoenas,
which if upheld, would mean that
the witnesses would not have to
appear in court.
Whether or not the subpoenas
will be quashed, will be decided
today before the hearing. If they
are quashed, it is possible that the
hearing will be postponed.

According to co-plaintiff Linda
Crouse, a preliminary' injunction
would destroy the ratio limitation
on female admissions. "Blacks at
Stanford have managed to insure
an admission floor that is
equivalent to their proportion in
the general population," added
Dr. Cross. "White women,
however, have an admission
ceiling that is under their
proportion in the population."
Next year's Freshman class will
have 900 males and 500 females,
according to a recent prediction by
a University official.
According to Dr. Cross, Leland
Stanford's will calls for equal
University services to both men
and women. However, Stanford
lawyers have argued that an
amendment in the 1890's changed
that provision. This and other

points may be at issue at the
hearing.
A First Step
The preliminary injunction
would make sure that Stanford
could not favor other
underepresented groups in
admissions without favoring
women also. According to Dr.
Cross, the preliminary injunction
is just the first step towards
stopping Stanford's "policies."
Although Stanford already sent
out acceptance notices to next
year's freshman class, Dr. Cross
says that incoming students are
not registered yet and changes can
still be made in the class'
composition.
Copies of the Cross complaint
and case files are in the
Undergraduate Library and can
also be obtained at the courthouse
on Grant Avenue.
