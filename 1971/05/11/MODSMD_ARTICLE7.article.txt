Graduating seniors who wish to protest the war in Vietnam will
have their chance to do so at commencement ceremonies, June 13.
A group calling itself Graduates Disrobe for Peace hopes to
forgo the traditional caps and gowns of commencement, and
donate the rental fees to one of three anti-war organizations.
They are also accepting donations equivilant to the refund from
those seniors not wanting to disappoint parents. A table has been
set up in White Plaza to handle such transactions until May 19, last
day to obtain a refund on a cap and gown.
The three organizations receiving funds are the Agape
Foundation, the Committee of Responsibility, and Draft Refusers
Support. The Agape Foundation funds a number of non-violent
projects in the Bay Area. It has aided Columbae House in public
education efforts, sponsored courses in non-violent action, and
conducted GI counseling.
The Committee of Responsibility is an organization providing
medical care in the States for war injured Vietnamese children who
cannot be treated in Vietnam.
The Draft Refusers Support is a new group aiding men facing
prison sentences for resisting the draft. They hope to aid the
families of resisters and reform prison conditions in addition to
aiding the resisters.
