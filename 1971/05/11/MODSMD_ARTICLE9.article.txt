# Week Features Quality Films
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Once again, an unusually low
number of films are being shown
on campus, but the best films of
Preston Sturges and Alfred
Hitchcock make the week an
excellent one.
"Sullivan's Travels" is one of
the truly great American films. As
funny as Preston Sturges' other

films, it is also more moving and
profound and is certainly the
most personal of the several
masterpieces the director made.
Joel McCrea and Veronica Lake
star along with members of
Sturges' stock company.
Also showing at Mem Clive
tonight at 7:30 is "Mr. Smith
Goes to Washington," Frank

Capra's celebrated celebration of
American idealism. James Stewart
in the title role is supported by
Jean Arthur, Claude Rains,
Edward Arnold, Thomas Mitchell
and Beulah Bondi.
"The People and Their Guns:
The People's War in Laos," a
documentary shot behind the
lines of the Pathet Lao, will be
shown by the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars in
Bishop at 7 and 9 tonight.
The film depicts the effect of
American policy in Laos and the
efforts taken there to resist
foreign force and influence.
French director Joris Ivens has
made several films on people's
revolutions.
The International Association
film this THURSDAY is "The
Lion Hunters," an ethnographic
film which took Jean Rouch
nearly a decade to complete. In
Cubberley.
"Strangers on a Train" is my
favorite Hitchcock and no small
measure of the credit is due to
Robert Walker, whose
performance is deliciously
malevolent in the subtle extreme.
The film has many brilliant
sequences as well, particularly the
spectacular merry-go-round finale.
In Tresidder on FRIDAY at 7, 8
and 9.
Also showing FRIDAY is "The
Pumpkin Eater," which boasts an
extraordinary list of credits:
written by Harold Pinter, directed
by Jack Clayton, music by
Georges Delerue, starring Anne
Bancroft, Peter Finch, James
Mason, Cedric Hardwicke, Alan
Webb and Maggie Smith. The film
met with a mixed reception, but
cannot possibly be without
interest. In Bishop at 7:30 and
9:45.
"Topkapi" remains one of the
good international caper pictures
made in the sixties. The locations
are colorful, the conceits amusing
and the cast (headed by Melina
Mercouri) engaging. This Jules
Dassin film, for which Peter
Ustinov won an Academy Award,
will be shown on SATURDAY at
7:30 and 10 in Cubberley.
