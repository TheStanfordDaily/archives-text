LET US SHARE OUR ANXIETIES TOGETHER
DISCUSS BETWEEN US, TELL OTHERS TOO,
WHAT SORT OF MEN WE CAN'T BE ANY LONGER
WHAT SORT OF MEN WE NOW DESIRE TO BE.

It was foggy on the Monterey Peninsula that morning. The roads were lined with young
people—old people —in-between people—all people. The noonday sun peeked through the
grey. Blue skies and a warm summer afternoon mingled lightly with pastel shirts and pleasant
scents. The grandstands were packed as Joan Baez walked center stage amidst a tremulous roar
of applause. Aptly titled: celebration; it was. More than anything else it reflected man's
ability to create a microcosm of beauty amidst a world torn by violence and hatred. It recon
firmed his innate goodness. It reinforced our belief that each person makes an important con
tribution to the whole: We all sent offour own tiny ripple. M ultiplied a thousand fold, we created
a tidal wave of understanding. It was one hell of a beautiful day. Merry Clayton was there;
Kris Kristofferson, too. Linda Rondstadt and the Beach Boys and thousands of people singing,
enjoying, swaying, loving. And thanks to Lou Adler, some of the day was captured
on tape. Now there's an album. Its /_V\ title: celebration. The artists and produc
ers are donating all royalties from tC> nst * tute or t^lc Study
Non-Violence, Palo Alto, Calif. It's the time the world took a
moment to stop and listen.
