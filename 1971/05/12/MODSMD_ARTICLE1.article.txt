# Trustees Reject 'Campaign GM'
## 
### BOB BACON 
At a meeting in San Francisco
yesterday, the Board of Trustees
declined to vote the University's GM
stock in favor of our reform proposals,
as had been urged by the "Campaign
GM" organization.
By a substantial margin in last
month's ASSU election, students had
urged the Trustees to back the reform
measures.
(Also at yesterday's meeting,
President Lyman announced that
Associate Provost Robert Rozensweig
has been promoted to Vice Provost.)
The Trustees expressed disapproval
of current GM management policies,
but on three of the four reform
proposals voted Stanford's shares with
GM management. On the fourth, a
proposal that GM withdrawall
operations from South Africa, the
Trustees chose to abstain but write a
letter to GM strongly urging them to
"do whatever is feasible to improve the
conditions of non-whites in South
Africa."
Former Council of Presidents
member Bob Grant, a leader of the
campaign to have students approve the
proposals, expressed frustration at the
board's decision. "They seemed to
display a real unwillingness to directly
challenge their peers and their own
concepts of corporate management,"
Grant said. "But they're going to have
to face Round 3 of Campaign GM next
year and we're not going to stop
there."
The Board expressed its sympathy
with the campaigners' efforts; however,
they noted that the specific proposals
advanced by Campaign GM were not
considered practical or appropriate for
the purposes. The trustees said on the
South Africa issue, "We doubt that
withdrawal from South Africa by
General Motors now would
significantly aid the cause of racial
equality in South Africa, or advance
the welfare of nonwhites subject to
discrimination there."
Oppose Discrimination
They affirmed that "Stanford
University firmly opposes all
discrimination based on race. We have
abstained from voting against the
Campaign GM proposal in order to
avoid any possible implication of
support for the policy of apartheid."
All four questions were decided on a
split vote, according to trustee Ira Hall.
The other three proposals, in
addition to the one regarding South
Africa, were;

That groups of shareholders be
permitted to nominate candidates for
the GM Board of Directors,
That the corporation disclose
"reasonably detailed information"
about pollution, safety standards, and
minority employment, and
That one director be elected from
each of three constituencies: GM
customers, employees, and dealers.
Although the trustees voted to
oppose these three proposals, they
expressed disagreement with current
management policy regarding the first
two of them by writing a letter to GM
officials.
Hall, head of the Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition and Stanford's only
black trustee, expressed his opposition
to the board's decisions, calling them
"inconsistent." "If you disagree with
the management, don't vote with
them," he said.
Stanford owns 23,008 shares of GM
stock, valued at approximately $1.9
million.
The Board deferred a decision on
whether to hold public hearings on the
Livingston-Blayney land use
policy/plan. According to Hall, this
means that the hearings, if held, will
not begin until fall quarter.

conditions of non-whites in South
Africa."
Former Council of Presidents
member Bob Grant, a leader of the
campaign to have students approve the
proposals, expressed frustration at the
board's decision. "They seemed to
display a real unwillingness to directly
challenge their peers and their own
concepts of corporate management,"
Grant said. "But they're going to have
to face Round 3 of Campaign GM next
year and we're not going to stop
there."
The Board expressed its sympathy
with the campaigners' efforts; however,
they noted that the specific proposals
advanced by Campaign GM were not
considered practical or appropriate for
the purposes. The trustees said on the
South Africa issue, "We doubt that
withdrawal from South Africa by
General Motors now would
significantly aid the cause of racial
equality in South Africa, or advance
the welfare of nonwhites subject to
discrimination there."
Oppose Discrimination
They affirmed that "Stanford
University firmly opposes all
discrimination based on race. We have
abstained from voting against the
Campaign GM proposal in order to
avoid any possible implication of
support for the policy of apartheid."
All four questions were decided on a
split vote, according to trustee Ira Hall.
The other three proposals, in
addition to the one regarding South
Africa, were;

That groups of shareholders be
permitted to nominate candidates for
the GM Board of Directors,
That the corporation disclose
"reasonably detailed information"
about pollution, safety standards, and
minority employment, and
That one director be elected from
each of three constituencies: GM
customers, employees, and dealers.
Although the trustees voted to
oppose these three proposals, they
expressed disagreement with current
management policy regarding the first
two of them by writing a letter to GM
officials.
Hall, head of the Midpeninsula
Urban Coalition and Stanford's only
black trustee, expressed his opposition
to the board's decisions, calling them
"inconsistent." "If you disagree with
the management, don't vote with
them," he said.
Stanford owns 23,008 shares of GM
stock, valued at approximately $1.9
million.
The Board deferred a decision on
whether to hold public hearings on the
Livingston-Blayney land use
policy/plan. According to Hall, this
means that the hearings, if held, will
not begin until fall quarter.
At a meeting in San Francisco
yesterday, the Board of Trustees
declined to vote the University's GM
stock in favor of our reform proposals,
as had been urged by the "Campaign
GM" organization.
By a substantial margin in last
month's ASSU election, students had
urged the Trustees to back the reform
measures.
(Also at yesterday's meeting,
President Lyman announced that
Associate Provost Robert Rozensweig
has been promoted to Vice Provost.)
The Trustees expressed disapproval
of current GM management policies,
but on three of the four reform
proposals voted Stanford's shares with
GM management. On the fourth, a
proposal that GM withdrawall
operations from South Africa, the
Trustees chose to abstain but write a
letter to GM strongly urging them to
"do whatever is feasible to improve the
conditions of non-whites in South
Africa."
