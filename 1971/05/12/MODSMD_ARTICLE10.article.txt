Wednesday afternoon at 4:15
in TMU small lounge a forum on
the topic, "Can an Historian be a
Radical?", sponsored by the
newly formed History
Undergraduate Students
Association, will be held. The
concept of student departmental
organization raises many
questions. Why organize? What is
the relationship between the
organization, the structure of
study, the department, and the
study itself, in this case, history?
These questions lead to
another question which some
history majors must repress in
order to function: why study
history? As a source I find myself
with Guide to Kulchur by Ezra
Pound, a book I once used for an
English class:
What we know about the arts
we know from practictioners,
usually from their work,
occasionally from their
comments. Our knowledge is

sometimes second hand, and
becomes more wafty with each
remove (p. 59).
I consider the study of history
at Stanford. Three scenes come to
mind:
1. History students file into
room 214, or a lesser lecture hall.
Some speak to friends about
anything which will suffer
immediate conclusion upon the
arrival of Prof. ... He enters and
stations himself at the podium;
students settle into their seats and
clasp their pens.
2. The history student knocks
tentatively on the door of
Prof. .. .'s office. He is invited in,
graduate school flashes before
him, and he begins. There is no
reason why he should feel ill at
ease; he does have a question and
the Professor seems cordial
enough. (What warmer image
could there be than the rotege at
the feet of the mentor?)
3. The Professor comes for

dinner at the history student's
dormitory. Discussion is strained
at first, but there are enough
people gathered at the table to ask
a sufficient number of unrelated
questions. (Afterwards, a feeling
of satisfaction to have spoken to
Professor .. . about something
other than history; a feeling of
relief or disappointment,
depending on the individual, to
return to history books.
Second-hand Knowledge
These images reinforce my
suspected agreement with Pound
that knowledge in the "learneries"
(his not endearing term for
universities) is indeed
second-hand. But why exactly?
We are removed from our teachers
by much more than lecture hall
decorum, office hours, and dining
room politesse.
One explanation comes
directly from the fact that the
department, for undergraduates, is
a factory. We enroll in large
lecture courses which often have
no discussion sections. When there
are actually sections, professors
seldom have time to teach them,
much less simply visit those
taught by assistants. Exams in
these classes become means of
dealing with large numbers of
students. Inter-relationships
between students are reduced to a
minimum. Atomization reinforces
the sense of artificiality.
Undergraduates Excluded
Another explanation comes
from the department's function as
a professional bureau; a function
which, by definition, excludes
undergraduates. A manifestation
of the effective exclusion of
undergraduates from the
department is their
insconspicuous absence in
decision-making. Decisions
concerning undergraduate
curriculum, teaching, and
controversial tenure cases have
been made exclusively by faculty.
There have been no channels,
formal or informal, for student
participation. More important, no
avenue for positive (rather than
reactive) undergraduate
participation to articulate areas of
dissatisfaction, to work on
solutions, and to recommend
changes has existed.
We are removed from our
teachers (and from some ideal of
true study) by the conception and
function of the history
department, and that concept is
reinforced by our
non-participation in efforts to
change it. Ezra Pound believed
that the common action of men,
based on common background
and informed with the energy of
responsibility creates "kulchur" —
organic learning, if you will. It
will not only be the studying of
history,but work on the study of
history which can prevent our
learning 112 rom being
"second-hand." The forum
Wednesday and the informal
meeting following are beginnings.

a factory. We enroll in large
lecture courses which often have
no discussion sections. When there
are actually sections, professors
seldom have time to teach them,
much less simply visit those
taught by assistants. Exams in
these classes become means of
dealing with large numbers of
students. Inter-relationships
between students are reduced to a
minimum. Atomization reinforces
the sense of artificiality.
Undergraduates Excluded
Another explanation comes
from the department's function as
a professional bureau; a function
which, by definition, excludes
undergraduates. A manifestation
of the effective exclusion of
undergraduates from the
department is their
insconspicuous absence in
decision-making. Decisions
concerning undergraduate
curriculum, teaching, and
controversial tenure cases have
been made exclusively by faculty.
There have been no channels,
formal or informal, for student
participation. More important, no
avenue for positive (rather than
reactive) undergraduate
participation to articulate areas of
dissatisfaction, to work on
solutions, and to recommend
changes has existed.
We are removed from our
teachers (and from some ideal of
true study) by the conception and
function of the history
department, and that concept is
reinforced by our
non-participation in efforts to
change it. Ezra Pound believed
that the common action of men,
based on common background
and informed with the energy of
responsibility creates "kulchur" —
organic learning, if you will. It
will not only be the studying of
history,but work on the study of
history which can prevent our
learning 112 rom being
"second-hand." The forum
Wednesday and the informal
meeting following are beginnings.

Wednesday afternoon at 4:15
in TMU small lounge a forum on
the topic, "Can an Historian be a
Radical?", sponsored by the
newly formed History
Undergraduate Students
Association, will be held. The
concept of student departmental
organization raises many
questions. Why organize? What is
the relationship between the
organization, the structure of
study, the department, and the
study itself, in this case, history?
These questions lead to
another question which some
history majors must repress in
order to function: why study
history? As a source I find myself
with Guide to Kulchur by Ezra
Pound, a book I once used for an
English class:
What we know about the arts
we know from practictioners,
usually from their work,
occasionally from their
comments. Our knowledge is

sometimes second hand, and
becomes more wafty with each
remove (p. 59).
I consider the study of history
at Stanford. Three scenes come to
mind:
1. History students file into
room 214, or a lesser lecture hall.
Some speak to friends about
anything which will suffer
immediate conclusion upon the
arrival of Prof. ... He enters and
stations himself at the podium;
students settle into their seats and
clasp their pens.
2. The history student knocks
tentatively on the door of
Prof. .. .'s office. He is invited in,
graduate school flashes before
him, and he begins. There is no
reason why he should feel ill at
ease; he does have a question and
the Professor seems cordial
enough. (What warmer image
could there be than the rotege at
the feet of the mentor?)
3. The Professor comes for

dinner at the history student's
dormitory. Discussion is strained
at first, but there are enough
people gathered at the table to ask
a sufficient number of unrelated
questions. (Afterwards, a feeling
of satisfaction to have spoken to
Professor .. . about something
other than history; a feeling of
relief or disappointment,
depending on the individual, to
return to history books.
Second-hand Knowledge
These images reinforce my
suspected agreement with Pound
that knowledge in the "learneries"
(his not endearing term for
universities) is indeed
second-hand. But why exactly?
We are removed from our teachers
by much more than lecture hall
decorum, office hours, and dining
room politesse.
One explanation comes
directly from the fact that the
department, for undergraduates, is
a factory. We enroll in large
