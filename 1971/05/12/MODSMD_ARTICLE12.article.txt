# Wide Variety Of Papers Provide Happier Hits
## 
### PAUL GRUSHKIN TOM GIVEN 
Only a year or so ago buying
cigarette papers at the Tresidder Drug
Store was a fairly traumatic experience.
Even buying Playboy was
least that was good old American
exploited sex. But dope . . . every one
(and especially the smirking clerk)
knew it rotted the mind and made
innocent college youth bombers and
killers.
Well. Mankind has evolved some and
Tresidder currently does a land office
trade in Wheatstraws, Tops, and Zig

Zag Whites—going briskly at 240 pack.,
a week.
That's 12,000-plus papers, gang. A
few stoned ponies.
Does the management ever wonder
what happens to those papers?
"Heavens no," chirped the salesgirl.
"Obviously they're not for tobacco."
"Some of the straightest people in
the world are buying papers,"
commented an employee Palo Alto's
India Imports. "And obviously it isn't
to smoke cigarettes. But then a couple
of little kids came in for some
chocolate papers the other day. They
said thev liked to chew on them."

"A lot of people buy our cigarette
papers, both young and old," a gruff
spokesman for Mac's Smoke Shop
declared. "Of course the oldsters buy
tobacco too."
Mac's, it might be noted, sells 15
cartons a week, at 24 packs to a carton,
and 50 papers to a pack. Figure that
one out.
Papers are becoming a Stanford
staple, if not an American one. Unless
you're given to perversions like
smoking out of your hand or spraying
it from a fogger, you'll need your
papers. "Papers and dope," said a local
cookster one night, "are like, well,
dope and papers."
What has never been answered to
our satisfaction is 'why Zig Zags?' There
seems to be, at least at Stanford, a
partial explanation.
First, Zig Zags are what Tresidder
stocks (Tops are ghastly and we
wouldn't recommend them even to the
Chaparral) and unless you're up for
truckin' around Palo Alto or flying up
to Sausalito, you'll buy what Tresidder
sells.
Sponsor Conspiracy
Secondly, sponsors have conspired
since the beginning of time to hook
their progeny on Zig Zags. "That's
what 1 was raised on," explained a
Branner initiate. "He handed me a pack
of Wheatstraws and told me to start
rolling. In our room, Zig Zags are in the
class of Kleenex and Q-Tips."
Zig Zag's Wheatstraw is the Stanford
bestseller. An excellent basic paper,
Wheatstraws crimp and roll easily, and
don't tear, even if you're clumsy.
Whites or Wheatstraws are hardly
what might be termed the premier
paper. In the interests of a happier, and
more healthful Spring quarter, the
collected heads of the Daily conducted

a fact-finding mission recently into
cigarette papers.
Two establishments in Palo Alto,
Mac's Smoke Shop (Emerson St.) and
India Imports (Town & Country
Village), will guide your way into the
further reaches of smoking pleasure.
Beware, however, that if you aren't
hooked now, smoking all the various
kinds of papers will take care of the
rest of your quarter.
India Imports will probably be easier
on you for the first expedition,
especially if you're loaded. They carry
twenty exotic varieties, with special
emphasis on flavored and novelty
papers. In the little case you will see
$100 bills, draft card, and flag papers,
Blanco y Negro, Camello, Bambu,

Marfil, Indio Rosa, Head, LaCroix,
Alfa, and Stella (flavored in mint,
strawberry, cherry, banana, and
liquorice) packets. Choose a few,
carefully, and head home for a good
smoke.
Indio Rosa Tops
Our top rated paper is, surprisingly,
Indio Rosa. Though we were pretty
ripped at the time, we seem to
remember them being good-fibered,
slow and even burning, smooth, and
well gummed, attributes of the most
desirable. In addition, they taste
magnificent.
We would rate Marfil wheats a close
second, with Spanish Zig Zags, Bambu,
Camello, and Rizla's following. Stella's
banana papers are well above the rest of
the flavored.
Beware of the novelties and curios.
Draft cards, flags, and $100 bills may
look grand and 'with-it,' but they taste
horrible and only God knows what's in
the ink you're inhaling.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if
they're carcinogenic," an India Imports
salesman stoutly declared. "And that
flavored crap is junk."
The salesman (his name escapes us,
but he's very nice) swore that Marfil
wheats were the very best. "Mild and
mellow-tasting was his verdict.
Caveat Empter
Beware also of the paper size. While
most papers such as Zig Zags, Rizla,
and Stella come in a standard length,
Marfils and some of the novelty papers
are oversized. This poses few problems
if you have the conviction and
coordination to roll your own; if you
are tied to technology, they won't fit
your machine.
Very little is known about rolling

machines in general. Rizla, a British
firm, makes two very fine models. The
standard model costs from $.75 to
$1.00 and is easy to operate and highly
portable.
A little bulkier but classier is the
model with room for a small stash
under the cover. Other machines vary
widely. Brown and Williamson
manufacture a machine that's a foot
long; it's simple to use, but a little
conspicous when you're standing in line
for the movies.
The Laredo will make you a
filter-tipped joint, if that's what you
desire. They tend to have trouble
sealing the edges, so be forewarned.
Not For The Paranoid
Mac's Smoke Shop is not a good
place to enter if you're feeling paranoid
about your vices. Be ready with an
excuse like, "Oh, these are for my baby
sister," if the salesman gives you
trouble. But Mac's is a must if you're
after Spanish Zig Zags, reputed by
European aficianados to be the world's
finest.
Apparently local spaced cowboys
have been frequenting Mac's as of late.
"We've been charging a little over what
might be considered the standard profit
on these things," explained the grim
entrepreneur. "We like to get a little
something for standing behind the
counter while people stare at the
packets and take five minutes to make
a decision."
Mac's also sells both kinds of
Marfils, Bambus, Zig Zags. Indio Rosas,
Rizla's, Alfas. Tops, and Lacroix, but
you'd better just grab the Spanish Zig
Zags and run. Just don't ask for
American flag papers. Mac will only go
so far.

RHB FOGGER—Every discriminating smoker will want this baby. Our friend
Ralph found it in a slightly incredible Sausalito headshop, but surely you know at
least one mellow Mechanical Engineering genius. Simply take your baby brother s
aquarium pump, hook it up to this specially designed pipe, pack a little something
in the bowl, light 'er up, and proceed to fog your friends.

India Imports. "And obviously it isn't
to smoke cigarettes. But then a couple
of little kids came in for some
chocolate papers the other day. They
said thev liked to chew on them."

"A lot of people buy our cigarette
papers, both young and old," a gruff
spokesman for Mac's Smoke Shop
declared. "Of course the oldsters buy
tobacco too."
Mac's, it might be noted, sells 15
cartons a week, at 24 packs to a carton,
and 50 papers to a pack. Figure that
one out.
Papers are becoming a Stanford
staple, if not an American one. Unless
you're given to perversions like
smoking out of your hand or spraying
it from a fogger, you'll need your
papers. "Papers and dope," said a local
cookster one night, "are like, well,
dope and papers."
What has never been answered to
our satisfaction is 'why Zig Zags?' There
seems to be, at least at Stanford, a
partial explanation.
First, Zig Zags are what Tresidder
stocks (Tops are ghastly and we
wouldn't recommend them even to the
Chaparral) and unless you're up for
truckin' around Palo Alto or flying up
to Sausalito, you'll buy what Tresidder
sells.
Sponsor Conspiracy
Secondly, sponsors have conspired
since the beginning of time to hook
their progeny on Zig Zags. "That's
what 1 was raised on," explained a
Branner initiate. "He handed me a pack
of Wheatstraws and told me to start
rolling. In our room, Zig Zags are in the
class of Kleenex and Q-Tips."
Zig Zag's Wheatstraw is the Stanford
bestseller. An excellent basic paper,
Wheatstraws crimp and roll easily, and
don't tear, even if you're clumsy.
Whites or Wheatstraws are hardly
what might be termed the premier
paper. In the interests of a happier, and
more healthful Spring quarter, the
collected heads of the Daily conducted

a fact-finding mission recently into
cigarette papers.
Two establishments in Palo Alto,
Mac's Smoke Shop (Emerson St.) and
India Imports (Town & Country
Village), will guide your way into the
further reaches of smoking pleasure.
Beware, however, that if you aren't
hooked now, smoking all the various
kinds of papers will take care of the
rest of your quarter.
India Imports will probably be easier
on you for the first expedition,
especially if you're loaded. They carry
twenty exotic varieties, with special
emphasis on flavored and novelty
papers. In the little case you will see
$100 bills, draft card, and flag papers,
Blanco y Negro, Camello, Bambu,

Marfil, Indio Rosa, Head, LaCroix,
Alfa, and Stella (flavored in mint,
strawberry, cherry, banana, and
liquorice) packets. Choose a few,
carefully, and head home for a good
smoke.
Indio Rosa Tops
Our top rated paper is, surprisingly,
Indio Rosa. Though we were pretty
ripped at the time, we seem to
remember them being good-fibered,
slow and even burning, smooth, and
well gummed, attributes of the most
desirable. In addition, they taste
magnificent.
We would rate Marfil wheats a close
second, with Spanish Zig Zags, Bambu,
Camello, and Rizla's following. Stella's
banana papers are well above the rest of
the flavored.
Beware of the novelties and curios.
Draft cards, flags, and $100 bills may
look grand and 'with-it,' but they taste
horrible and only God knows what's in
the ink you're inhaling.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if
they're carcinogenic," an India Imports
salesman stoutly declared. "And that
flavored crap is junk."
The salesman (his name escapes us,
but he's very nice) swore that Marfil
wheats were the very best. "Mild and
mellow-tasting was his verdict.
Caveat Empter
Beware also of the paper size. While
most papers such as Zig Zags, Rizla,
and Stella come in a standard length,
Marfils and some of the novelty papers
are oversized. This poses few problems
if you have the conviction and
coordination to roll your own; if you
are tied to technology, they won't fit
your machine.
Very little is known about rolling

machines in general. Rizla, a British
firm, makes two very fine models. The
standard model costs from $.75 to
$1.00 and is easy to operate and highly
portable.
A little bulkier but classier is the
model with room for a small stash
under the cover. Other machines vary
widely. Brown and Williamson
manufacture a machine that's a foot
long; it's simple to use, but a little
conspicous when you're standing in line
for the movies.
The Laredo will make you a
filter-tipped joint, if that's what you
desire. They tend to have trouble
sealing the edges, so be forewarned.
Not For The Paranoid
Mac's Smoke Shop is not a good
place to enter if you're feeling paranoid
about your vices. Be ready with an
excuse like, "Oh, these are for my baby
sister," if the salesman gives you
trouble. But Mac's is a must if you're
after Spanish Zig Zags, reputed by
European aficianados to be the world's
finest.
Apparently local spaced cowboys
have been frequenting Mac's as of late.
"We've been charging a little over what
might be considered the standard profit
on these things," explained the grim
entrepreneur. "We like to get a little
something for standing behind the
counter while people stare at the
packets and take five minutes to make
a decision."
Mac's also sells both kinds of
Marfils, Bambus, Zig Zags. Indio Rosas,
Rizla's, Alfas. Tops, and Lacroix, but
you'd better just grab the Spanish Zig
Zags and run. Just don't ask for
American flag papers. Mac will only go
so far.

cigarette-paper-buying leads directly to marijuana smoking. Thousands of concerned Stanford students have voluntarily

Only a year or so ago buying
cigarette papers at the Tresidder Drug
Store was a fairly traumatic experience.
Even buying Playboy was

exploited sex. But dope . . . every one
(and especially the smirking clerk)

innocent college youth bombers and
killers.
Well. Mankind has evolved some and
Tresidder currently does a land office
trade in Wheatstraws, Tops, and Zig

Zag Whites—going briskly at 240 pack.,
a week.
That's 12,000-plus papers, gang. A
few stoned ponies.
Does the management ever wonder
what happens to those papers?

our satisfaction is 'why Zig Zags?' There
seems to be, at least at Stanford, a
partial explanation.
First, Zig Zags are what Tresidder
stocks (Tops are ghastly and we
wouldn't recommend them even to the
Chaparral) and unless you're up for
truckin' around Palo Alto or flying up
to Sausalito, you'll buy what Tresidder
sells.
Sponsor Conspiracy
Secondly, sponsors have conspired
since the beginning of time to hook
their progeny on Zig Zags. "That's
what 1 was raised on," explained a
Branner initiate. "He handed me a pack
of Wheatstraws and told me to start
rolling. In our room, Zig Zags are in the
class of Kleenex and Q-Tips."
Zig Zag's Wheatstraw is the Stanford
bestseller. An excellent basic paper,
Wheatstraws crimp and roll easily, and
don't tear, even if you're clumsy.
Whites or Wheatstraws are hardly
what might be termed the premier
paper. In the interests of a happier, and
more healthful Spring quarter, the
collected heads of the Daily conducted

a fact-finding mission recently into
cigarette papers.
Two establishments in Palo Alto,
Mac's Smoke Shop (Emerson St.) and
India Imports (Town & Country
Village), will guide your way into the
further reaches of smoking pleasure.
Beware, however, that if you aren't
hooked now, smoking all the various
kinds of papers will take care of the
rest of your quarter.
India Imports will probably be easier
on you for the first expedition,
especially if you're loaded. They carry
twenty exotic varieties, with special
emphasis on flavored and novelty
papers. In the little case you will see
$100 bills, draft card, and flag papers,
Blanco y Negro, Camello, Bambu,

Marfil, Indio Rosa, Head, LaCroix,
Alfa, and Stella (flavored in mint,
strawberry, cherry, banana, and
liquorice) packets. Choose a few,
carefully, and head home for a good
smoke.
Indio Rosa Tops
Our top rated paper is, surprisingly,
Indio Rosa. Though we were pretty
ripped at the time, we seem to
remember them being good-fibered,
slow and even burning, smooth, and
well gummed, attributes of the most
desirable. In addition, they taste
magnificent.
We would rate Marfil wheats a close
second, with Spanish Zig Zags, Bambu,
Camello, and Rizla's following. Stella's
banana papers are well above the rest of
the flavored.
Beware of the novelties and curios.
Draft cards, flags, and $100 bills may
look grand and 'with-it,' but they taste
horrible and only God knows what's in
the ink you're inhaling.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if
they're carcinogenic," an India Imports
salesman stoutly declared. "And that
flavored crap is junk."
The salesman (his name escapes us,
but he's very nice) swore that Marfil
wheats were the very best. "Mild and
mellow-tasting was his verdict.
Caveat Empter
Beware also of the paper size. While
most papers such as Zig Zags, Rizla,
and Stella come in a standard length,
Marfils and some of the novelty papers
are oversized. This poses few problems
if you have the conviction and
coordination to roll your own; if you
are tied to technology, they won't fit
your machine.
Very little is known about rolling

machines in general. Rizla, a British
firm, makes two very fine models. The
standard model costs from $.75 to
$1.00 and is easy to operate and highly
portable.
A little bulkier but classier is the
model with room for a small stash
under the cover. Other machines vary
widely. Brown and Williamson
manufacture a machine that's a foot
long; it's simple to use, but a little
conspicous when you're standing in line
for the movies.
The Laredo will make you a
filter-tipped joint, if that's what you
desire. They tend to have trouble
sealing the edges, so be forewarned.
Not For The Paranoid
Mac's Smoke Shop is not a good
place to enter if you're feeling paranoid
about your vices. Be ready with an
excuse like, "Oh, these are for my baby
sister," if the salesman gives you
trouble. But Mac's is a must if you're
after Spanish Zig Zags, reputed by
European aficianados to be the world's
finest.
Apparently local spaced cowboys
have been frequenting Mac's as of late.
"We've been charging a little over what
might be considered the standard profit
on these things," explained the grim
entrepreneur. "We like to get a little
something for standing behind the
counter while people stare at the
packets and take five minutes to make
a decision."
Mac's also sells both kinds of
Marfils, Bambus, Zig Zags. Indio Rosas,
Rizla's, Alfas. Tops, and Lacroix, but
you'd better just grab the Spanish Zig
Zags and run. Just don't ask for
American flag papers. Mac will only go
so far.

Ralph found it in a slightly incredible Sausalito headshop, but surely you know at

OVER THE COUNTER—But what's she going to do with those papers? One graduate thesis, recently published, declares that
cigarette-paper-buying leads directly to marijuana smoking. Thousands of concerned Stanford students have voluntarily
undertaken the task of providing basic experimental data. Tresidder Drug Store, according to a spokesman is said to be
"cooperative."
Only a year or so ago buying
cigarette papers at the Tresidder Drug
Store was a fairly traumatic experience.
Even buying Playboy was
least that was good old American
exploited sex. But dope . . . every one
(and especially the smirking clerk)
knew it rotted the mind and made
innocent college youth bombers and
killers.
Well. Mankind has evolved some and
Tresidder currently does a land office
trade in Wheatstraws, Tops, and Zig

Zag Whites—going briskly at 240 pack.,
a week.
That's 12,000-plus papers, gang. A
few stoned ponies.
Does the management ever wonder
what happens to those papers?
"Heavens no," chirped the salesgirl.
"Obviously they're not for tobacco."
"Some of the straightest people in
the world are buying papers,"
commented an employee Palo Alto's
India Imports. "And obviously it isn't
to smoke cigarettes. But then a couple
of little kids came in for some
chocolate papers the other day. They
said thev liked to chew on them."

"A lot of people buy our cigarette
papers, both young and old," a gruff
spokesman for Mac's Smoke Shop
declared. "Of course the oldsters buy
tobacco too."
Mac's, it might be noted, sells 15
cartons a week, at 24 packs to a carton,
and 50 papers to a pack. Figure that
one out.
Papers are becoming a Stanford
staple, if not an American one. Unless
you're given to perversions like
smoking out of your hand or spraying
it from a fogger, you'll need your
papers. "Papers and dope," said a local
cookster one night, "are like, well,
dope and papers."

Whites or Wheatstraws are hardly
what might be termed the premier
paper. In the interests of a happier, and
more healthful Spring quarter, the
collected heads of the Daily conducted

a fact-finding mission recently into
cigarette papers.
Two establishments in Palo Alto,
Mac's Smoke Shop (Emerson St.) and
India Imports (Town & Country
Village), will guide your way into the
further reaches of smoking pleasure.
Beware, however, that if you aren't
hooked now, smoking all the various
kinds of papers will take care of the
rest of your quarter.
India Imports will probably be easier
on you for the first expedition,
especially if you're loaded. They carry
twenty exotic varieties, with special
emphasis on flavored and novelty
papers. In the little case you will see
$100 bills, draft card, and flag papers,
Blanco y Negro, Camello, Bambu,

Marfil, Indio Rosa, Head, LaCroix,
Alfa, and Stella (flavored in mint,
strawberry, cherry, banana, and
liquorice) packets. Choose a few,
carefully, and head home for a good
smoke.
Indio Rosa Tops
Our top rated paper is, surprisingly,
Indio Rosa. Though we were pretty
ripped at the time, we seem to
remember them being good-fibered,
slow and even burning, smooth, and
well gummed, attributes of the most
desirable. In addition, they taste
magnificent.
We would rate Marfil wheats a close
second, with Spanish Zig Zags, Bambu,
Camello, and Rizla's following. Stella's
banana papers are well above the rest of
the flavored.
Beware of the novelties and curios.
Draft cards, flags, and $100 bills may
look grand and 'with-it,' but they taste
horrible and only God knows what's in
the ink you're inhaling.
"I wouldn't be at all surprised if
they're carcinogenic," an India Imports
salesman stoutly declared. "And that
flavored crap is junk."
The salesman (his name escapes us,
but he's very nice) swore that Marfil
wheats were the very best. "Mild and
mellow-tasting was his verdict.
Caveat Empter
Beware also of the paper size. While
most papers such as Zig Zags, Rizla,
and Stella come in a standard length,
Marfils and some of the novelty papers
are oversized. This poses few problems
if you have the conviction and
coordination to roll your own; if you
are tied to technology, they won't fit
your machine.
Very little is known about rolling

machines in general. Rizla, a British
firm, makes two very fine models. The
standard model costs from $.75 to
$1.00 and is easy to operate and highly
portable.
A little bulkier but classier is the
model with room for a small stash
under the cover. Other machines vary
widely. Brown and Williamson
manufacture a machine that's a foot
long; it's simple to use, but a little
conspicous when you're standing in line
for the movies.
The Laredo will make you a
filter-tipped joint, if that's what you
desire. They tend to have trouble
sealing the edges, so be forewarned.
Not For The Paranoid
Mac's Smoke Shop is not a good
place to enter if you're feeling paranoid
about your vices. Be ready with an
excuse like, "Oh, these are for my baby
sister," if the salesman gives you
trouble. But Mac's is a must if you're
after Spanish Zig Zags, reputed by
European aficianados to be the world's
finest.
Apparently local spaced cowboys
have been frequenting Mac's as of late.
"We've been charging a little over what
might be considered the standard profit
on these things," explained the grim
entrepreneur. "We like to get a little
something for standing behind the
counter while people stare at the
packets and take five minutes to make
a decision."
Mac's also sells both kinds of
Marfils, Bambus, Zig Zags. Indio Rosas,
Rizla's, Alfas. Tops, and Lacroix, but
you'd better just grab the Spanish Zig
Zags and run. Just don't ask for
American flag papers. Mac will only go
so far.

RHB FOGGER—Every discriminating smoker will want this baby. Our friend
Ralph found it in a slightly incredible Sausalito headshop, but surely you know at
least one mellow Mechanical Engineering genius. Simply take your baby brother s
aquarium pump, hook it up to this specially designed pipe, pack a little something
in the bowl, light 'er up, and proceed to fog your friends.

OVER THE COUNTER—But what's she going to do with those papers? One graduate thesis, recently published, declares that
cigarette-paper-buying leads directly to marijuana smoking. Thousands of concerned Stanford students have voluntarily
undertaken the task of providing basic experimental data. Tresidder Drug Store, according to a spokesman is said to be
"cooperative."
