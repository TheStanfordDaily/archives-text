# Passing Attack To Be Excellent
## Football Drills Promising 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Stanford's football team put
on quite an impressive
performance last Saturday in their
first public full-scale scrimmage of
the spring. Despite missing a
number of injured players, the
defending Rose Bowl champions
showed that they definitely have
the potential for a return
performance next January.
"We did a lot of good things"
said coach John Ralston
following the morning practice
held before over 300 fans. One of
those good things was the
offensive explosiveness displayed
by the Indians.
As Ralston put it, "We're still
throwing a lot." Despite losing
Heisman Trophy winner Jim
Plunkett and all last year's
first-string receivers, it is obvious
Stanford will not adopt an Ohio
State grind-it-out attack.

Senior quarterback Don Bunce
(6-1, 196) was still "shaking the
cobwebs," according to Ralston,
but he showed flashes of the
talent he had two years ago when
he was probably one of the finest
second-string quarterbacks in the
country. Junior Jess Freitas (6-1,
192), who will most likely back
up Bunce, also showed promise,
but his main challenger Mike
Boryla (6-3, 105) was sidelined
with a bruised sternum.
The problems created by losing
an entire crew of receivers have
obviously been lessened by the
fine performances of a number of
newcomers and players shifted
from other positions. Outstanding
kick return man Eric Cross (5-9,
175) will probably be the starting
flanker next fall.
Bob Moore's tight end position
will be filled by junior Bob Scott
(6-3, 200) who caught one of

Bunce's touchdown passes on
Saturday. The other wide
receiving spot will most likely go
to converted defensive back Miles
Moore, (6-1,196) who sat out last
season with a neck injury.
But either wide receiving
position may be hotly contested if
Ralston decides to use sophomore
John Winesberry at a receiving
spot. Winesberry was the
individual star of the scrimmage as
he showed exceptional ability to
run after catching the ball.
The 6-1, 185 pound
Oklahoman caught 6 passes for
177 yards and two touchdowns.
In addition to displaying some
outstanding moves and fine speed,
especially on a 72 yard
touchdown screen pass,
Winesberry also ran for 66 yards
on a beautiful inside reverse.
Ralston says that Winesberry is
being shifted back to the running
back position he occupied on this
year's freshman team for the final
week of spring practice.
According to Ralston, "We're
establishing his flexibility. If we
use him in the backfield, then
we'll still be looking for another
wide receiver." Senior John
Koehn, juniors Don Alvarado,
Bob Berry and Glen Stone, as well
as sophomore Rufus Shaw, who
has been participating in track all
spring, are all possibilities for that
extra spot.
Although Ralston was
impressed with his receivers, he
also had praise for his defensive
backs. With four lettermen
returning, he will be able to start
an all veteran backfield of
halfbacks Charles McLoud (6-0,
193) and Benny Barnes (6-1,190)
and safties Pat Moore (6-0, 200)
and Steve Murray (6-1, 180).
Junior Tim Robnett (5-10, 180)
and Sophomore Jim Ferguson
(6-1, 185), will add good depth at
both positions.
With a number of veterans
sidelined on Saturday, Ralston
was also able to look at a number
of other sophomores and some of
his transfers. Ralston was
particularly impressed by two
junior college transfer guards,
Chuck Cordes (6-1, 240) and Mike
Askea (6-4, 240). The two did
fine jobs filling in for probably
starters Doug Adams (6-2, 230)
and Younger Klippert (6-3, 235).

Bob Berry and Glen Stone, as well
as sophomore Rufus Shaw, who
has been participating in track all
spring, are all possibilities for that
extra spot.
Although Ralston was
impressed with his receivers, he
also had praise for his defensive
backs. With four lettermen
returning, he will be able to start
an all veteran backfield of
halfbacks Charles McLoud (6-0,
193) and Benny Barnes (6-1,190)
and safties Pat Moore (6-0, 200)
and Steve Murray (6-1, 180).
Junior Tim Robnett (5-10, 180)
and Sophomore Jim Ferguson
(6-1, 185), will add good depth at
both positions.
With a number of veterans
sidelined on Saturday, Ralston
was also able to look at a number
of other sophomores and some of
his transfers. Ralston was
particularly impressed by two
junior college transfer guards,
Chuck Cordes (6-1, 240) and Mike
Askea (6-4, 240). The two did
fine jobs filling in for probably
starters Doug Adams (6-2, 230)
and Younger Klippert (6-3, 235).
Stanford's football team put
on quite an impressive
performance last Saturday in their
first public full-scale scrimmage of
the spring. Despite missing a
number of injured players, the
defending Rose Bowl champions
showed that they definitely have
the potential for a return
performance next January.
"We did a lot of good things"
said coach John Ralston
following the morning practice
held before over 300 fans. One of
those good things was the
offensive explosiveness displayed
by the Indians.
As Ralston put it, "We're still
throwing a lot." Despite losing
Heisman Trophy winner Jim
Plunkett and all last year's
first-string receivers, it is obvious
Stanford will not adopt an Ohio
State grind-it-out attack.

Senior quarterback Don Bunce
(6-1, 196) was still "shaking the
cobwebs," according to Ralston,
but he showed flashes of the
talent he had two years ago when
he was probably one of the finest
second-string quarterbacks in the
country. Junior Jess Freitas (6-1,
192), who will most likely back
up Bunce, also showed promise,
but his main challenger Mike
Boryla (6-3, 105) was sidelined
with a bruised sternum.
The problems created by losing
an entire crew of receivers have
obviously been lessened by the
fine performances of a number of
newcomers and players shifted
from other positions. Outstanding
kick return man Eric Cross (5-9,
175) will probably be the starting
flanker next fall.
Bob Moore's tight end position
will be filled by junior Bob Scott
(6-3, 200) who caught one of

Bunce's touchdown passes on
Saturday. The other wide
receiving spot will most likely go
to converted defensive back Miles
Moore, (6-1,196) who sat out last
season with a neck injury.
But either wide receiving
position may be hotly contested if
Ralston decides to use sophomore
John Winesberry at a receiving
spot. Winesberry was the
individual star of the scrimmage as
he showed exceptional ability to
run after catching the ball.
The 6-1, 185 pound
Oklahoman caught 6 passes for
177 yards and two touchdowns.
In addition to displaying some
outstanding moves and fine speed,
especially on a 72 yard
touchdown screen pass,
Winesberry also ran for 66 yards
on a beautiful inside reverse.
Ralston says that Winesberry is
being shifted back to the running
back position he occupied on this
year's freshman team for the final
week of spring practice.
According to Ralston, "We're
establishing his flexibility. If we
use him in the backfield, then
we'll still be looking for another
wide receiver." Senior John
Koehn, juniors Don Alvarado,
Bob Berry and Glen Stone, as well
as sophomore Rufus Shaw, who
has been participating in track all
spring, are all possibilities for that
extra spot.
