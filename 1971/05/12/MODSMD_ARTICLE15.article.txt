## Warpaint Wonders 
### charlie hoffman 
Daubed with warpaint and fired with the inspiration provided by a
week's worth of publicity confidently predicting an upset victory, the
Indian track squad put together a team effort to defeat California, the
deposed 1970 NCAA Champion.
It would be easy to say that Stanford won the Big Meet because of
the absence of Eddie Hart and the ineffective showing of Isaac Curtis.
Both of these fine sprinters have been slowed by injuries this season
and their healthy participation in the meet would probably given the
Bears the 440 Relay, the 220, and the 100 yard dash. Chuck Francis
and Ken Curl turned in excellent times to net the majority of the
points in these events for the Cards.
There was no surprise in the performances of Randy White, Rick
Tipton, Casey Carrigan, Don Kardong, and Tim Nicholson, who
dominated their events. Stanford's shocking victory was largely due to
the seconds and thirds recorded by men who were spurred to lifetime
bests. Steve Davis took a second in the shot with the longest put of his
life, and picked up a point with a third in the discus. Arvid Kretz,
Duncan Macdonald, Tim Anderson, Dave Larsen, Bob Coe, Pete
Fairchild, and Jim Kauffman came through to give the team the depth
that it needed so badly in previous losses.
Favorable Publicity
Area newspapers predicted an upset victory for the Indians during
last week's pre-Big Meet publicity. Many observers thought that the
papers did not have a basis for their optimism about Stanford's
chances. After all, the Bears had come within two points of beating
the most powerful dual meet team in the country, UCLA. The Cards
failed in another bid to win their first Pac-8 meet in two years that
weekend against Washington and the outlook for the Cal meet should
not have been much better.
The pre-meet publicity buildup did a lot to convince the squad that
they did have a good chance of winning. As a result, the Indians came
out on Saturday wearing war paint for the first time since their last
Pac-8 victory over Cal in 1969. For a change, they were convinced
that they could produce the team effort needed to challenge the
Bears.
