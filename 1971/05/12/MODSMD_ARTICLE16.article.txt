# Laxmen Topple UCLA,Oregon
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After three straight losses at
home the Stanford Lacrosse team
finally won in a big way, as they
routed Oregon 9-3 and UCLA
10-2. The two games, played on
Sunday, constituted a
double-header which is rare in
lacrosse.
The Indians had little trouble
with Oregon. Their style was quite
different from Stanford's since
the Ducks haven't had too much
experience in the sport. The result
was a rough heavy-handed style
indicative of teams with little
experience. One Stanford player
complained about the roughness,
but there was only one injury in
which Larry Crowford suffered a
bruised shoulder and will be out
for a week.
The Cards were ahead only 4-2
at halftime but tallied four times
in the third quarter to put the
game out of reach. Though not
overpowering, the Stanford
offense got the job done. The
defense played an excellent
second half as they kept the
Ducks off balance throughout.
Co-captain Chip Lovemann and
Joel Bartlett paced the Card
attack with two goals apiece.
After a 45 minute break the
Cards faced off against UCLA.

The Bruins had defeated Oregon,
8-4, on Saturday, so the game
figured to be close.
However, the Indians, despite
the heat and the fatigue of the
first game played a good game,
dominating the contest from the
outset.
The Cards started quickly and
had a 5-1 lead at halftime. They
controlled play for the most part.
The only Bruin goal came as a
result of a lapse in the Card
defense. But Stanford's offense
was in fine form and executing
well. The last goal in the first half
was indicative. With play in the
UCLA end, a Stanford
crease-attack man beat his man
with a fine move and passed off to
teammate Butch Hazelett.

Hazelett maneuvered into position
and fired a backhander over his
shoulder into the far corner. It
was an amazing play because
Hazelett wasn't looking at the
goalie when he shot.
He added three other goals to
lead the Stanford attack. Chip
Lovemann scored twice, while
Ted Suen, Dave Denton, Paul
Tittmann, and Chuck Ross added
single markers for Stanford.
Coach Eakland was pleased with
the team's play, saying they
played much better in the second
game.
The Stanford team is presently
in third place in the Northern
California Lacrosse Association.
Palo Alto is in first while Cal in in
second.

WHY DID I EVER BECOME A COACH? â€”Coach John Ralston reflects on the finer points of the game
with his charges during a break in one this spring's drills. The nine touchdowns scored in Saturday's
controlled scrimmage offers plenty of optimism for next fall's frolic.
