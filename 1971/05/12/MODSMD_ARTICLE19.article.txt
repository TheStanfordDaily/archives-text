Dollar Bill Strengthens
LONDON — The U.S. dollar strengthened on European
currency exchanges yesterday but big-money speculators held
on tightly to the West German marks they bought by the billion
last week, hoping for profits.
An acute shortage of dollars developed in much of Western
Europe as speculators bought up whatever was available to
make good the dollars they had sold short to buy marks.
This was ironic, because it was the glut of dollars that
prompted West Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands and
Austria to take measures Sunday to rid themselves of dollars to
check inflation.
Dealers said there was a strong indication speculators were
standing pat on their holdings of marks, waiting for a bigger
increase in the value of the West German currency than the 3
percent it showed Tuesday.

SACRAMENTO — An Assembly committee approved
legislation Tuesday to pay the city of Berkeley $15,050 for
part of the police costs in controlling demonstrations and riots
at the University of California.
Assemblyman Kenneth Meade, D-Oakland, author of the
measure, said those figures are half of the extra police costs in
excess of $100,000 incurred the past year by police called to
the Berkeley campus.
He said legislation is on the books for the state to pay those
costs, but no money has ever been appropriated to make the
payments.
The Assembly Education Committee approved the bill, AB
799, on a split voice vote and sent it to the Ways and Means
Committee.
L.A. B of A's Bombed
LOS ANGELES — Two suburban branches of the Bank of
America were firebombed early yesterday, authorities said.
Damage was minor.
They were the 9th and 10th in the Los Angeles area in three
weeks.

Police said a gasoline firebomb was thrown against the rear
of the Bank of America's Chatsworth branch, scorching the
rear door.
In the second arson attempt, a fire bomb was hurled
through a window at the Woodland Hills branch, but failed to
ignite, police said.
Monday night, a bomb blast blew out the side door of a
Glendale Savings and Loan Association branch. Damage was
estimated at $25,000. A long-haired youth was reported seen
fleeing from the building area.
Shortly before midnight Sunday a bomb blast blew a hole in
the rear wall of a Bank of America branch in Berkeley.
There have been 19 bombings and 19 arson attempts since
February 1970 at branches of Bank of America, the world's
largest commercial bank.
