# Three Liberals Make City Council; Palo Altans Say 'Out By Dec. 31’
## 
### KIM McCALL 
The liberal coalition which had sought to wrest
control of the Palo Alto City Council from the
development-minded Council majority fell just short of
their goal in yesterday's city election.
The election drew 61.2% of the city's registered
voters.
Elected to the four vacant seats on the Council,
which has ultimate control of zoning in the city, were
conservative 10-year council veteran Frances Dias and
liberals Enid Pearson (incumbent), Alan Henderson, and
Richard Rosenbaum.
Also on the ballot was a proposition which asked the
voters to indicate their preference between President
Nixon's "handling of the withdrawal of United States
armed forces" from Indochina and accelerated
withdrawl to remove all armed forces by December 31,
1971. The anti-administration statement drew 8,586
(60.4%) votes against 5,627 for the present policy.
2,583 voters abstained.
To gain control of the Council, the liberal slate had
to capture all four vacant seats.

In the only upset, former councilman Frank
Gallagher was turned out of office.
Henderson is a member of Common Cause and has
been active in many local liberal groups. Rosenbaum
headed the Citizens Committee to Block the
Superblock, a highrise office structure in downtown
Palo Alto.
Also running on the liberal slate was Sylvia Seman,
former president of Palo Alto League of Women Voters,
who lost to Dias by over 400 votes.
The Council now consists of 4 liberals and 5
pro-development conservatives.
