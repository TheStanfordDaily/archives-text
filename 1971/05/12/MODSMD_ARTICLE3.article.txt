# Lyman Reaffirms Chapel Policy
## 
### ROBIN STICKNEY 
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel
here, will have "full responsibility for
the program of Memorial Church" in
the future, according to a
memorandum released by the
President's office yesterday.
"In keeping with this
responsibility," the resolution
continues, "it is assumed that the Dean
of the Chapel. . . will draw up general
guidelines for determining what
activities fit within the program of the
Church..."
The memorandum, sent to Napier
and Charles Meyers, Chairman of the
Committee on Public Events (COPE),
came after arbitration between Napier
and COPE, by representatives of the
President's office.
Complaints Received
Meyers explained that the question
of establishing criteria for use of the
Chapel originated in the President's
office where complaints were received
regarding the use of Mem Chu. That
office asked COPE to look into the
matter.
Members of COPE recommended to
Lyman that either COPE itself or a
subcommittee "take responsibility for
the use of Memorial Church by other
than the Chaplain of the Dean of the
Chapel." This body was to formulate
criteria for the use of the Church for
"secular activities" and interpret that
criteria in case of disputes.
Very Pleased
Both Napier and Meyers have stated
that they are "very pleased" with the
President's decision.
"It's clear that the resolution leaves
things precisely as they were,"
commented Napier. "They were
presented to President Pitzer's office in
a letter," last year.
The guidelines Napier sent to Pitzer
were the first two Commandments of
the New Testament: "You shall love
the Lord your God with all your heart

and all your might" and "Love your
neighbor as yourself."
Dean Napier went on to explain that
"anything which speaks to, elucidates,
or explains either of these is legitimate
in the chapel program."
Meyers Satisfied
Professor Meyers also expressed his
satisfaction with the resolution which
states that COPE "will be responsible
for all general uses which do not fall
within the program of the Church."
Meyers added that "even there our

only interest is getting guidelines,
criteria, or standards set up for granting
and denying use of the Chapel. We
never had a notion of any power or
supervision over religious programs,"
stated Meyers.
"Memorial Church is the only
facility in the University community
which is not governed by some
guidelines . . . everything else is. We are
sympathetic with the President's wishes
[that some guidelines be established.]
"President Lyman has asked the
Dean to draw his own criteria; this is
what we wanted all along," Meyers
continued "Up until now there has
been a great deal of uncertainty about
these criteria."
Meyers also feels that "we still don't
have a regular University committee for
Memorial Church." However, there is
some question about the definition of
an official committee, and Meyers
"does not claim to be an expert."
Not Single-Handed
Napier feels that his Church
Advisory Board, comprised of faculty
and staff members selected by the
official Committee on Committees, and
his Chapel Board of volunteer students
more than adequately represent the
University community.
"I have never operated single
handedly or without advice from
authorities such as these boards,"
Napier said.
In general, unless special exceptions
are agreed upon by President Lyman,
all of the usual University policies will
apply to meetings scheduled in the
Church; for instance, all meetings will
be open to the public unless otherwise
specifically stated.
Requests received by the Dean for
use of the Church will be considered by
him, and if they are judged to fail
within the "stated and announced
program" of the Church, they will be
approved under those conditions and
general university policies governing the
use of all facilities.

If these requests do not fall within
these criteria, they will be referred to
the Office of Public Events for handling
under regularly established policies.
Dean Napier feels that the
recommendations are broadly enough
defined to give him the final
responsibility for the Chapel and all
that it entails.
Meyers considers the situation
a nalogous to that of the Athletic Dept.
and the Stadium, Dinkelspiel
Auditorium and the Music Dept., or
Mem Aud and the Drama Dept. "The
prime tenant decides what the program
will be, and that's it."


ACTIVE MINISTRYâ€”Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier stands outside
the San Mateo Selective Service Office.
Napier's broad interpretation of what
constitutes legitimate functions of the
Chapel have occasionally resulted in
demands that his authority be
abrogated. Mediators from President
Lyman's office have negotiated the
latest proposal, in which scheduling of
non-Chapel-related events in Memorial
Church would be the responsibility of
the Committee on Public Exercises.
The mediators' decision was that Dean
Napier would be allowed to decide,
using his own criteria, which events are
related to his ministry.
