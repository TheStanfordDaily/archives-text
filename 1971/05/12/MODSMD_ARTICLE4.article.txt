## 
### THERESA RAMIREZ 
Suspended English professor, Bruce
Franklin pleaded nolo contendre
Monday to obstructing an officer
in the performance of his duties, and
was fined $625 in Municipal Court in
Redwood City.
Franklin's plea was entered in
response to charges filed in connection
with a march held in support of the Los
Siete defendants in Redwood City on
January 25.
Franklin had originally been charged
with felonious assault and battery on a
police officer, but the charges were
reduced at his arraignment to a
misdemeanor charge of resisting arrest.
Six months of summary probation
was also imposed upon him by Judge
Frank Comaich, a punishment to be
terminated if Franklin pays his fine
within ten days.
In response to why he did not
choose to contest the charge Franklin
said, "I couldn't afford to. The last

time I took a case to court it was a five
week trial after which I was finally
found innocent, but 1 just can't afford
the time now. I have to prepare my
Stanford case.
Also, it would have been selfish of
me to keep a lawyer tied up when there
are very serious cases coming up. I got
my lawyer, R. Jay Engle to take Chris
Laury's case."
