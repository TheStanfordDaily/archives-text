# Evidence Sought In Assault Case
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies
yesterday evening searched the home of
Chris Laury and Leo Bazile in
connection with the alleged beating of
a Hospital worker last week.
Police confiscated four shotguns, a
carbine, a .45 pistol, ammunition,
sunglasses, and two pairs of pants at
Laury's house. According to the
occupants, the weapons are all legally
purchased and registered.
Two pairs of pants and sunglasses
were also taken at Bazile's Escondido
Village apartment.
According to the warrant, objects of
the search were the cigarette lighter
allegedly used to burn the victim, and
clothing worn by the alleged assailants.
Laury, Black Liberation Front
(BLF) member, and Bazile, former
chairman of the Black Students Union
(BSU), are charged with felonies in the
alleged assault on Mary Jane Schmidt.
Both have been released on bail. Bazile,
who had been in Washington, turned
himself in yesterday morning.
Warrant
The apparel confiscated did not
completely meet the description in the
warrant. The sunglasses identified in
the warrant are large, round, and
brown; those seized were red, green,
and black. A blue prescription pair was
also taken. No weapons were listed in
the warrant.
Police seized two pairs of brown
pants from Laury's home but one
source insisted that neither pair
belonged to the accused. A brown
leather jacket and 2 pairs of levis - one
marine-green and the other gold-brown
— were taken at Bazile's.
Searches
The two searches occured between
5:30 and 5:45 p.m. Assistant District
Attorney Poling served the warrant on
Bazile. He then proceeded to Laury's
home where eight police cars were
posted for possible crowd control.
Laury stated he was not present
when the search began "Jerome ..."

(who refuses to state his last name)
claims to have been the only person
present in Laury's house when the
search began. According to him,
officers seized the weapons without
recording the serial numbers. One
policeman reportedly said, "Well, we
got what we want."
A crowd of 60 people quickly
formed outside the house. More police
appeared, and the eight patrol cars
completely surrounded the building.
A few rocks were thrown, but no
arrests took place.
After searching for approximately
50 minutes, police departed to the jeers
of the crowd. According to residents of
the house, police looked only through
closets; apparently not bothering to
search for the butane lighter which was
allegedly used to burn Schmidt.
Police "Mistake"
Laury later said that he thinks the
police feel that they made a "mistake"
in arresting Bazile. "Now they would
pick two men of the BLF, probably
four."
"The (Stanford) administration digs
Bazile, and doesn't dig me."
Yesterday morning in Palo Alto
Bazile pleaded not guilty to three
misdemeanors stemming from the April
9 Hospital sit-in. He traveled then to
Redwood City to surrender on a
warrant charging him with two felonies
in the alleged beating to Schmidt.
Judge J. Barton Phelps set June 24
for a trial date in the case. Bail has been
set at $12,500 and $1,250 has already
been raised.
Laury was arraigned Monday in the
alleged beating case and pleaded not
guilty. A preliminary hearing has been
set for June 18.
Laury is free on $6,250 bail after it
was reduced from $12,500. The
amount was reduced by Judge Roy
Seagraves after Laury's attorney, Miss
Ann Cumings, said he should be free to
represent Hospital workers in
negotiations with the administration.

got what we want."
A crowd of 60 people quickly
formed outside the house. More police
appeared, and the eight patrol cars
completely surrounded the building.
A few rocks were thrown, but no
arrests took place.
After searching for approximately
50 minutes, police departed to the jeers
of the crowd. According to residents of
the house, police looked only through
closets; apparently not bothering to
search for the butane lighter which was
allegedly used to burn Schmidt.
Police "Mistake"
Laury later said that he thinks the
police feel that they made a "mistake"
in arresting Bazile. "Now they would
pick two men of the BLF, probably
four."
"The (Stanford) administration digs
Bazile, and doesn't dig me."
Yesterday morning in Palo Alto
Bazile pleaded not guilty to three
misdemeanors stemming from the April
9 Hospital sit-in. He traveled then to
Redwood City to surrender on a
warrant charging him with two felonies
in the alleged beating to Schmidt.
Judge J. Barton Phelps set June 24
for a trial date in the case. Bail has been
set at $12,500 and $1,250 has already
been raised.
Laury was arraigned Monday in the
alleged beating case and pleaded not
guilty. A preliminary hearing has been
set for June 18.
Laury is free on $6,250 bail after it
was reduced from $12,500. The
amount was reduced by Judge Roy
Seagraves after Laury's attorney, Miss
Ann Cumings, said he should be free to
represent Hospital workers in
negotiations with the administration.
San Mateo County Sheriff's deputies
yesterday evening searched the home of
Chris Laury and Leo Bazile in
connection with the alleged beating of
a Hospital worker last week.
Police confiscated four shotguns, a
carbine, a .45 pistol, ammunition,
sunglasses, and two pairs of pants at
Laury's house. According to the
occupants, the weapons are all legally
purchased and registered.
Two pairs of pants and sunglasses
were also taken at Bazile's Escondido
Village apartment.
According to the warrant, objects of
the search were the cigarette lighter
allegedly used to burn the victim, and
clothing worn by the alleged assailants.
Laury, Black Liberation Front
(BLF) member, and Bazile, former
chairman of the Black Students Union
(BSU), are charged with felonies in the
alleged assault on Mary Jane Schmidt.
Both have been released on bail. Bazile,
who had been in Washington, turned
himself in yesterday morning.
Warrant
The apparel confiscated did not
completely meet the description in the
warrant. The sunglasses identified in
the warrant are large, round, and
brown; those seized were red, green,
and black. A blue prescription pair was
also taken. No weapons were listed in
the warrant.
Police seized two pairs of brown
pants from Laury's home but one
source insisted that neither pair
belonged to the accused. A brown
leather jacket and 2 pairs of levis - one
marine-green and the other gold-brown
— were taken at Bazile's.
Searches
The two searches occured between
5:30 and 5:45 p.m. Assistant District
Attorney Poling served the warrant on
Bazile. He then proceeded to Laury's
home where eight police cars were
posted for possible crowd control.
Laury stated he was not present
when the search began "Jerome ..."

(who refuses to state his last name)
claims to have been the only person
present in Laury's house when the
search began. According to him,
officers seized the weapons without
recording the serial numbers. One
policeman reportedly said, "Well, we
got what we want."
