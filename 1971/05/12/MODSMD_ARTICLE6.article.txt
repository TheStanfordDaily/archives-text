# Draw Results
## 576 Lack Housing 
### CARLA KALLAN 
Some 576 students, 457 men and
119 women, will find themselves
classified "unassigned" when the
outcome of the first round of the
university housing draw is revealed
today. The last male student to receive
on-campus housing was number 6,543;
the last female student number 8,994.
This acute housing shortage, the
most severe in the university's history,
results both from a record number of
residents wishing to remain on-campus
and the addition of 1,450 entering
freshmen, who are required to live in
university residences.
In an interview yesterday, Larry
Horton, Assistant Dean of Students for
Housing, emphasized that students who
have not been placed in residences
"should not panic. The situation may
yet open up," he said.
Horton explained that some
students entered the draw merely out
of curiosity as to how well they would

do and have little intention of
accepting their assignments. This
should produce some vacancies. Also,
there are still 88 places in Manzanita
Park that will not be filled until the
second draw. There are spaces for four
men and five women in the Ecology
House, for one man and one woman in
Columbae, and for one woman in
Toyon.
Horton encouraged those students
who are debating whether to live on or
off campus to drop out of the draw and
give "a fair chance" to other students
who truly want university housing. He
also urged seniors with only one
quarter to complete before graduation,
not to occupy spots where others could
be placed for an entire year.
Those who are provided with
university housing after the first draw
will receive a response card on which
they designate one of three alternatives.
They can accept their residence
assignment, retain the option of that
residence assignment but enter the
second draw in the hopes of obtaining a
more desirable choice, or they can drop
out of university housing completely.
There is no penalty in selecting the
first option and later dropping out of
university housing. If the second option
is selected, however, and the student
leaves the university system, he will be
charged a $10 administrative fee. If he
drops out after the August deadline, he
will lose his $50 housing deposit.
Response cards should be filled out
and returned to residence hall offices
by tomorrow. The second draw will be
held next week, and the final results
announced by Monday, May 24. A
detailed letter about possible housing
alternatives will be sent to those
students still unassigned to the
conclusion of the second draw.
