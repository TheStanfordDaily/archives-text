food service
Editor, THE DAILY:
The "13 Students in
Education" who wrote concerning
food service in the School of
Education apparently failed to do
their homework. We all
appreciated the service provided
by the handicapped lady.
However her experience (and that
of several graduate students who
previously ran the service)
indicated that the volume of
business would not pay wages for
six hours a day. As a result she
voluntarily gave up the food
consession at the end of the
quarter.

There is little evidence to
support the claim that a few
vending machines ran her out of
business. Furthermore the vending
machines are not maintained by
that faceless entity, "the
University," as alleged in the
letter. Rather the machines are in
the building at the request of the
Education Association in order to
provide food service when the
lounge is closed.
The letter concluded, "The
task has devolved to those
revolting machines." Actually the
task has devolved to the wife of a
graduate student who is providing
food service from 10:30 to 1:00.
I can but give the "13 students
in Education" an 'A+' for good

intentions and a 'C' for knowledge
of the facts.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Briefly, I would like to make
the suggestion that Boards of
Trustees as now constituted and
selected are antiquated, irrelevant
bodies still operating on the idea
that wealthy and powerful men
(and the wives and widows of
wealthy and powerful men)
somehow are able to operate a
university. The report of the
Educational Testing Service study

printed in Friday's Daily only
makes public knowledge what has
been apparent to many people for
a long time: since these men know
little about the processes and
value of education they should
not have the ultimate control over
the University that they now
have.
A far better way to decide the
ultimate questions of
development of the University,of
policies on faculty tenure, student
rights, employee benefits, land
development programs, and the
total relationship of the University
to the community would be to
give the faculty, students and staff
some absolute power, instead of
merely procedural power.
A public debate and discussion
on abandoning the rule by the
Board of Trustees and giving it to
some kind of tricameral body
would be a good beginning to
making significant steps to
democratize the University.

give the faculty, students and staff
some absolute power, instead of
merely procedural power.
A public debate and discussion
on abandoning the rule by the
Board of Trustees and giving it to
some kind of tricameral body
would be a good beginning to
making significant steps to
democratize the University.
