# McCloskey Fights Uphill Battle
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Pete McCloskey has come a long way in 20 years. In 1952 he was awarded the
Navy Cross for heroism in the Korean war. In 1967, as a conservationist lawyer,
he 'sunk the Good Ship Lollipop,' Mrs. Shirley Temple Black, in the Republican
primary, and went on to triumph in the Congressional election.
Now McCloskey threatens to run against President Nixon in next year's 17
primaries if the Administration's Indo-China war policies are not altered, and no
other acceptable Republican candidate emerges.
McCloskey's current notoriety stems from his call on February 10 at Stanford
(the night of the two unsolved shootings on campus) for a "national dialogue" on
the possibility of impeaching Nixon.
In a major House address shortly afterwards, the greying 43-year-old Stanford
alumnus declared, "I do not advocate impeachment, but the question is one which
justifies a national discussion and debate, if only to bring home to the President
the depth of despair many of us feel over his recent moves without prior consent
of Congress."
Great Apathy
McCloskey has met with tremendous apathy and antagonism within the
Republican Party, although national polls have indicated that nearly
three-quarters of the American people desire an end to the Vietnamese conflict by
the end of this year.
No GOP leaders have indicated any support for a possible McCloskey
candidacy. The California Republican Assembly, the largest party volunteer
organization in the state, has, in fact, adopted resolutions condemning him for
"siding with radical groups on the left to promote violence" and urged him to
"register in another party."
McCloskey, only days ago, joined with Stanford President Richard Lyman in
posting bail money for former BSU chairman Leo Bazile also a McCloskey
summer interim two years ago who is accused of beating a Medical Center
employee a week ago.
The conservative United Republicans of California also have adopted
resolutions demanding that he resign both from the Republican Party and from
the Congress because of "publicly promoting dissention over the conduct of
President Nixon's inherited role in the undeclared Vietnam war."
Reagan
California Governor Ronald Reagan contends that McCloskey's call for a
"dialogue" on presidential impeachment is an oversimplification of the
Vietnamese conflict; Nixon, Reagan commented, "will not leave Vietnam if it
means abandoning the young men who are held prisoner by the enemy."
McCloskey dismisses the attacks on his positions. "My major credo is not party
loyalty; it's trying to find the best way to serve the nation best.
"There's no such thing as loyalty to a political party; that stifles political
debate."
The Nixon Administration has not paid much public attention to McCloskey's
possible presidential candidacy. Their response might be likened to dealing with a
tiny fly: one option is leaving the entire issue alone, and letting it flutter andlive
its few months, the other to squash it before it grows bigger.
'Who Is He 1 '
Herbert Klein, Nixon's communication director, remarked only Monday, "I
don't think most Americans are aware of who Congressman McCloskey is at this
point.
"I think that the issue he is raising, Vietnam, will not be a major issue next
year unless it's a positive one on behalf of the President," Klein declared.
Although McCloskey speaks of the many Republicans allegedly sympathetic to
his views, the only tangible support thus far is from the newly-created bipartisan
Committee for Peace and New Priorities, to which he belongs. The 20
Congressmen are currently touring the nation; through persuasive speeches they
art 1 attempting to bring constituent pressure on Representatives who support
Nixon's Vietnamese policies.

McCloskey himself has unsuccessfully tried to interest five other well-known
Republican liberals to run for the presidency: Senators Mark Hatfield (Ore.),
Charles Mathias (Md.), Charles Percy (111.), New York City Mayor John V.
Lindsay, and John Gardner, Chairman of Common Cause.
Student Organization
Student organizations have been formed to aid McCloskey in his possible
candidacy, including one group at Stanford, but they are concentrated almost
entirely in the West. Hundreds of campus groups nationwide, in comparison, are
supporting George McGovern's presidential aspirations.
Thus far, the majority of McCloskey's support has come from Democrats.
Individual democrats financed his recent fact-finding mission to Indochina and
articles appearing in the Democratic New York Times have made him a national
media attraction.
Allard K. Lowenstein, the outspoken former Congressman from Long Island
and chairman of the 'Dump Johnson Movement,' has greatly influenced the quiet
McCloskey. "He said things most Congressmen fear to day," noted McCloskey.
"And now we address him as a former Congressman."
McCloskey's basic opposition to the continuing Vietnamese conflict stems
from a belief that Congress's authority to "determine where and when we go to
war" has been usurped by the Executive branch, and from a deep-seated distrust
of Nixon, who is in McCloskey's words "a wholly political man, without principle,
who is willing to do whatever is expedient."
'Wally Hickel's Letter
"The finest thing to come out of this Administration," notes McCloskey, "was
Wally Hickel's letter."
Although McCloskey would probably run as a "peace candidate," his military
training and legal background (his father, both grandfathers, and two
brothers-in-law are all lawyers), provoke unexpected political stances.
He is very strongly in favor of the draft; he believes in the credo of the
"citizen-soldier." He was also one of 15 Representatives who voted against the
women's rights amendment. Since that day, the Congressman has allegedly "taken
an unholy beating from my wife and others."
McCloskey is deeply committed to a "51 percent majority vote and the
jurisdiction of the court" as the primary means of resolving disputes. A strong
critic of violence as a political tactic, he feels "my colleagues are less likely to vote
unless those in the peace movement act within the law."
McCloskey, with the rest of the House, will vote on three important War
funding measures before June 30.

establishment Don Quixote. Significant differences, however, do exist between
the two, and in their relative chances of success.
In analysis, the Democratic Party is far more the 'open' party. McCloskey is
finding fewer members of his own party actively supporting him than Democrats
did for McCarthy.
Liberal Republicans, too, are hardly as outspoken as their Democratic
counterparts. Another barrier is his desired appeal to younger Americans who
have, in recent years, allied with the Democrats and not the GOP.
Colorado Republican Governor John Love has noted, "With Nixon emerging
for the Republicans in 1968, anti-war advocates felt that only by dumping LBJ
could they get a sharply different Vietnam policy. In 1972, anybody who doesn't
like Nixon's policies can just vote Democratic and get something different."

of Nixon, who is in McCloskey's words "a wholly political man, without principle,
who is willing to do whatever is expedient."
'Wally Hickel's Letter
"The finest thing to come out of this Administration," notes McCloskey, "was
Wally Hickel's letter."
Although McCloskey would probably run as a "peace candidate," his military
training and legal background (his father, both grandfathers, and two
brothers-in-law are all lawyers), provoke unexpected political stances.
He is very strongly in favor of the draft; he believes in the credo of the
"citizen-soldier." He was also one of 15 Representatives who voted against the
women's rights amendment. Since that day, the Congressman has allegedly "taken
an unholy beating from my wife and others."
McCloskey is deeply committed to a "51 percent majority vote and the
jurisdiction of the court" as the primary means of resolving disputes. A strong
critic of violence as a political tactic, he feels "my colleagues are less likely to vote
unless those in the peace movement act within the law."
McCloskey, with the rest of the House, will vote on three important War
funding measures before June 30.

policies are not altered, and no other acceptable Republican candidate emerges.
establishment Don Quixote. Significant differences, however, do exist between
the two, and in their relative chances of success.
In analysis, the Democratic Party is far more the 'open' party. McCloskey is
finding fewer members of his own party actively supporting him than Democrats
did for McCarthy.
Liberal Republicans, too, are hardly as outspoken as their Democratic
counterparts. Another barrier is his desired appeal to younger Americans who
have, in recent years, allied with the Democrats and not the GOP.
Colorado Republican Governor John Love has noted, "With Nixon emerging
for the Republicans in 1968, anti-war advocates felt that only by dumping LBJ
could they get a sharply different Vietnam policy. In 1972, anybody who doesn't
like Nixon's policies can just vote Democratic and get something different."
Pete McCloskey has come a long way in 20 years. In 1952 he was awarded the
Navy Cross for heroism in the Korean war. In 1967, as a conservationist lawyer,
he 'sunk the Good Ship Lollipop,' Mrs. Shirley Temple Black, in the Republican
primary, and went on to triumph in the Congressional election.
Now McCloskey threatens to run against President Nixon in next year's 17
primaries if the Administration's Indo-China war policies are not altered, and no
other acceptable Republican candidate emerges.
McCloskey's current notoriety stems from his call on February 10 at Stanford
(the night of the two unsolved shootings on campus) for a "national dialogue" on
the possibility of impeaching Nixon.
In a major House address shortly afterwards, the greying 43-year-old Stanford
alumnus declared, "I do not advocate impeachment, but the question is one which
justifies a national discussion and debate, if only to bring home to the President
the depth of despair many of us feel over his recent moves without prior consent
of Congress."
Great Apathy
McCloskey has met with tremendous apathy and antagonism within the
Republican Party, although national polls have indicated that nearly
three-quarters of the American people desire an end to the Vietnamese conflict by
the end of this year.
No GOP leaders have indicated any support for a possible McCloskey
candidacy. The California Republican Assembly, the largest party volunteer
organization in the state, has, in fact, adopted resolutions condemning him for
"siding with radical groups on the left to promote violence" and urged him to
"register in another party."
McCloskey, only days ago, joined with Stanford President Richard Lyman in
posting bail money for former BSU chairman Leo Bazile also a McCloskey
summer interim two years ago who is accused of beating a Medical Center
employee a week ago.
The conservative United Republicans of California also have adopted
resolutions demanding that he resign both from the Republican Party and from
the Congress because of "publicly promoting dissention over the conduct of
President Nixon's inherited role in the undeclared Vietnam war."
Reagan
California Governor Ronald Reagan contends that McCloskey's call for a
"dialogue" on presidential impeachment is an oversimplification of the
Vietnamese conflict; Nixon, Reagan commented, "will not leave Vietnam if it
means abandoning the young men who are held prisoner by the enemy."
McCloskey dismisses the attacks on his positions. "My major credo is not party
loyalty; it's trying to find the best way to serve the nation best.
"There's no such thing as loyalty to a political party; that stifles political
debate."
The Nixon Administration has not paid much public attention to McCloskey's
possible presidential candidacy. Their response might be likened to dealing with a
tiny fly: one option is leaving the entire issue alone, and letting it flutter andlive
its few months, the other to squash it before it grows bigger.
'Who Is He 1 '
Herbert Klein, Nixon's communication director, remarked only Monday, "I
don't think most Americans are aware of who Congressman McCloskey is at this
point.
"I think that the issue he is raising, Vietnam, will not be a major issue next
year unless it's a positive one on behalf of the President," Klein declared.
Although McCloskey speaks of the many Republicans allegedly sympathetic to
his views, the only tangible support thus far is from the newly-created bipartisan
Committee for Peace and New Priorities, to which he belongs. The 20
Congressmen are currently touring the nation; through persuasive speeches they
art 1 attempting to bring constituent pressure on Representatives who support
Nixon's Vietnamese policies.

McCloskey himself has unsuccessfully tried to interest five other well-known
Republican liberals to run for the presidency: Senators Mark Hatfield (Ore.),
Charles Mathias (Md.), Charles Percy (111.), New York City Mayor John V.
Lindsay, and John Gardner, Chairman of Common Cause.
Student Organization
Student organizations have been formed to aid McCloskey in his possible
candidacy, including one group at Stanford, but they are concentrated almost
entirely in the West. Hundreds of campus groups nationwide, in comparison, are
supporting George McGovern's presidential aspirations.
Thus far, the majority of McCloskey's support has come from Democrats.
Individual democrats financed his recent fact-finding mission to Indochina and
articles appearing in the Democratic New York Times have made him a national
media attraction.
Allard K. Lowenstein, the outspoken former Congressman from Long Island
and chairman of the 'Dump Johnson Movement,' has greatly influenced the quiet
McCloskey. "He said things most Congressmen fear to day," noted McCloskey.
"And now we address him as a former Congressman."
McCloskey's basic opposition to the continuing Vietnamese conflict stems
from a belief that Congress's authority to "determine where and when we go to
war" has been usurped by the Executive branch, and from a deep-seated distrust
of Nixon, who is in McCloskey's words "a wholly political man, without principle,
who is willing to do whatever is expedient."

"There's no such thing as loyalty to a political party; that stifles political
debate."
The Nixon Administration has not paid much public attention to McCloskey's
possible presidential candidacy. Their response might be likened to dealing with a
tiny fly: one option is leaving the entire issue alone, and letting it flutter andlive
its few months, the other to squash it before it grows bigger.
'Who Is He 1 '
Herbert Klein, Nixon's communication director, remarked only Monday, "I
don't think most Americans are aware of who Congressman McCloskey is at this
point.
"I think that the issue he is raising, Vietnam, will not be a major issue next
year unless it's a positive one on behalf of the President," Klein declared.
Although McCloskey speaks of the many Republicans allegedly sympathetic to
his views, the only tangible support thus far is from the newly-created bipartisan
Committee for Peace and New Priorities, to which he belongs. The 20
Congressmen are currently touring the nation; through persuasive speeches they

Nixon's Vietnamese policies.

McCloskey himself has unsuccessfully tried to interest five other well-known
Republican liberals to run for the presidency: Senators Mark Hatfield (Ore.),
Charles Mathias (Md.), Charles Percy (111.), New York City Mayor John V.
Lindsay, and John Gardner, Chairman of Common Cause.
Student Organization
Student organizations have been formed to aid McCloskey in his possible
candidacy, including one group at Stanford, but they are concentrated almost
entirely in the West. Hundreds of campus groups nationwide, in comparison, are
supporting George McGovern's presidential aspirations.
Thus far, the majority of McCloskey's support has come from Democrats.
Individual democrats financed his recent fact-finding mission to Indochina and
articles appearing in the Democratic New York Times have made him a national
media attraction.
Allard K. Lowenstein, the outspoken former Congressman from Long Island
and chairman of the 'Dump Johnson Movement,' has greatly influenced the quiet
McCloskey. "He said things most Congressmen fear to day," noted McCloskey.
"And now we address him as a former Congressman."
McCloskey's basic opposition to the continuing Vietnamese conflict stems
from a belief that Congress's authority to "determine where and when we go to
war" has been usurped by the Executive branch, and from a deep-seated distrust
of Nixon, who is in McCloskey's words "a wholly political man, without principle,
who is willing to do whatever is expedient."
'Wally Hickel's Letter
"The finest thing to come out of this Administration," notes McCloskey, "was
Wally Hickel's letter."
Although McCloskey would probably run as a "peace candidate," his military
training and legal background (his father, both grandfathers, and two
brothers-in-law are all lawyers), provoke unexpected political stances.
He is very strongly in favor of the draft; he believes in the credo of the
"citizen-soldier." He was also one of 15 Representatives who voted against the
women's rights amendment. Since that day, the Congressman has allegedly "taken
an unholy beating from my wife and others."
McCloskey is deeply committed to a "51 percent majority vote and the
jurisdiction of the court" as the primary means of resolving disputes. A strong
critic of violence as a political tactic, he feels "my colleagues are less likely to vote
unless those in the peace movement act within the law."
McCloskey, with the rest of the House, will vote on three important War
funding measures before June 30.

policies are not altered, and no other acceptable Republican candidate emerges.
establishment Don Quixote. Significant differences, however, do exist between
the two, and in their relative chances of success.
In analysis, the Democratic Party is far more the 'open' party. McCloskey is
finding fewer members of his own party actively supporting him than Democrats
did for McCarthy.
Liberal Republicans, too, are hardly as outspoken as their Democratic
counterparts. Another barrier is his desired appeal to younger Americans who
have, in recent years, allied with the Democrats and not the GOP.
Colorado Republican Governor John Love has noted, "With Nixon emerging
for the Republicans in 1968, anti-war advocates felt that only by dumping LBJ
could they get a sharply different Vietnam policy. In 1972, anybody who doesn't
like Nixon's policies can just vote Democratic and get something different."
Pete McCloskey has come a long way in 20 years. In 1952 he was awarded the
Navy Cross for heroism in the Korean war. In 1967, as a conservationist lawyer,
he 'sunk the Good Ship Lollipop,' Mrs. Shirley Temple Black, in the Republican
primary, and went on to triumph in the Congressional election.
Now McCloskey threatens to run against President Nixon in next year's 17
primaries if the Administration's Indo-China war policies are not altered, and no
other acceptable Republican candidate emerges.
McCloskey's current notoriety stems from his call on February 10 at Stanford
(the night of the two unsolved shootings on campus) for a "national dialogue" on
the possibility of impeaching Nixon.
In a major House address shortly afterwards, the greying 43-year-old Stanford
alumnus declared, "I do not advocate impeachment, but the question is one which
justifies a national discussion and debate, if only to bring home to the President
the depth of despair many of us feel over his recent moves without prior consent
of Congress."
Great Apathy
McCloskey has met with tremendous apathy and antagonism within the
Republican Party, although national polls have indicated that nearly
three-quarters of the American people desire an end to the Vietnamese conflict by
the end of this year.
No GOP leaders have indicated any support for a possible McCloskey
candidacy. The California Republican Assembly, the largest party volunteer
organization in the state, has, in fact, adopted resolutions condemning him for
"siding with radical groups on the left to promote violence" and urged him to
"register in another party."
McCloskey, only days ago, joined with Stanford President Richard Lyman in
posting bail money for former BSU chairman Leo Bazile also a McCloskey
summer interim two years ago who is accused of beating a Medical Center
employee a week ago.
The conservative United Republicans of California also have adopted
resolutions demanding that he resign both from the Republican Party and from
the Congress because of "publicly promoting dissention over the conduct of
President Nixon's inherited role in the undeclared Vietnam war."
Reagan
California Governor Ronald Reagan contends that McCloskey's call for a
"dialogue" on presidential impeachment is an oversimplification of the
Vietnamese conflict; Nixon, Reagan commented, "will not leave Vietnam if it
means abandoning the young men who are held prisoner by the enemy."
McCloskey dismisses the attacks on his positions. "My major credo is not party
loyalty; it's trying to find the best way to serve the nation best.
"There's no such thing as loyalty to a political party; that stifles political
