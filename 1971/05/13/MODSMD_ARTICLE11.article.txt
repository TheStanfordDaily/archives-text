# Open Housing Plan
## 
### 
Students, faculty, film stars,
community volunteers,
government agencies, and
attorneys yesterday joined forces
in a major new assault on illegal
housing discrimination in the Bay
Area.
Called Operation Sentinel, it
combines a multi-media,
multi-lingual public information
campaign now through July 31
with detailed local followup on
individual complaints of alleged
discrimination.
One of the largest regional
efforts of its kind ever undertaken
the operation was organized by
the Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban
Coalition through its Fair Housing
Task Force.
The public information
package, developed with a $6,000
grant provided by the National
Committee Against
Discrimination in Housing
through funds from the
Department of Housing and
Urban Development (HUD),
would have cost $250,000 to
produce commercially.
Coalition Executive Director
Ira Hall and Mrs. Richard W.
(Jing) Lyman, wife of Stanford's
president and chairman of the
Coalition task force, stated they
received a very favorable
reception when the
Stanford-produced films were

previewed before top HUD
officials, including Secretary-
George Romney, last week in
Washington.
Working with Profs. Henry
Breitrose and Ricardo Diaz of the
Communication Department, 21
students in film and broadcasting
have produced 12, 30-second
color TV spots (seven in English,
three in Spanish, and two in
Chinese), 12, 30-second radio
spots, and supporting news
releases, posters, and brochures
for local distribution in Bay Area
communities.
The spots are based on specific
case histories and on discussions
with minority group members.
According to Lyman, student
teams who produced the spots
were made up of blacks, chicanos,
and anglos who designed them to
convey to the public at large and
members of the housing industry
in particular that discrimination in
housing based on race, creed or
color is illegal.
Racial discrimination in
housing still is extremely
widespread, Coalition Director
Hall noted. A recent audit
conducted by the Mid-Peninsula
Citizens for Fair Housing in
Sunnyvale uncovered
discriminatory practices in half
the apartment units surveyed.


LIBERATIONâ€”Germaine Greer, English authoress of "The Female
Eunuch," will speak in White Plaza today at noon. Greer has recently
become a frequent guest on late night talk shows strongly endorsing
liberation of both men and women. Greer will meet with students at
Storey House around 1:00 p.m.
