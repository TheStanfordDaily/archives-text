# The
						$$$ Crisis: How Big?

News Analysis
Although last week's dollar crisis
had European finance ministers rushing
to midnight meetings and American
tourists perplexedly holding their
hard-earned dollars, U.S. Treasury
officials seemed only mildly disturbed
and the American news media merely
reported the events without much
consideration of their long-range
consequences.
The European monetary
readjustments were not very significant
to the U.S. from a short-range
viewpoint. Stanford Professor of
Economics John Gurley remarked, ' It
won't have much effect on the U.S.
economy." But the crisis did devalue
the dollar in respect to other currencies
and weaken its position as a world
reserve currency- major steps in the
decay of the present system of U.S.
economic imperialism.
The actions of the European nations
were intended to restore a chaotic
currency situation to an equilibrium.
The crisis began last week when
remarks by German Economic Minister
Karl Schiller led speculators to believe
the mark would be revalued. They
began selling dollars for marks and
other currencies, and European Central
Banks were flooded with dollars.
Switzerland and Austria responded
by revaluing their currencies upward.
The Central Banks of Germany and the
Netherlands stopped purchasing dollars
at the official exchange rate, thus
allowing their currencies to "float"
with respect to the dollar until a new
equilibrium exchange rate can be
reached.
Natural Response
Their response was natural. Since
the dollar is an official reserve
currency, European Central Banks are
bound by agreement with the
International Monetary Fund to buy
sufficient dollars to maintain the fixed
exchange rates. Such actions increase

the money supply, thus adding to
inflationary pressures.
European governments attempting
to check inflation through monetary
policy—reducing the money supply and
thus driving up interest rates—find that
dollars flow in, attracted by the rising
interest on investments.
The influx of dollars minimizes the
effectiveness of the governments'
inflation control measures.
Switzerland's Finance Minister
commented that "the Americans have
created sources of inflation throughout
the world."
These sources are the vast pools of
dollars held outside the U.S. Harry
Cleaver, a Stanford graduate student in
Economics, claims that the war and
U.S. economic imperialism are primary
causes of such dollar crises; military
expenditures in both Southeast Asia
and Europe have led to the formation
of a vast pool of "Eurodollars" that is
at the command of multinational
speculators.
The military expenditures go
concurrently with investments abroad.
Gurley explained, "We're protecting a
lot of investments around the
world—and it costs a lot of money to
make those investments and to
maintain the status quo. It takes a lot
of money to defend the free world
under attack."
Investment Incentive
Falling interest rates in the United
States also provided incentive for
investment in Europe. The price of the
dollar in European money markets
began to fall as the supply of dollars
began to exceed demand.
Speculators—primarily American and
multinational companies- began
dumping dollars in exchange for other
currencies. The crisis was underway.
The European currency adjustments
will have little effect in the near future.
U.S. exports may be more competitive
and imports more expensive, and
European trade may be disturbed for a

time. But, as Gurley points out, "This
could keep happening and it wouldn't
affect the U.S. to any great degree."
More important is the effect of the
dollar crisis on the position of the
dollar as a world reserve currency. At
present, the dollar is an international
currency, backed for the most part not
by gold but by the strength of the U.S.
economy.
The balance of payments deficit
provides dollars that can be used as
reserves overseas. "As long as we
provide currency to the rest of the
world, there will be a balance of
payments deficit," Cleaver stated.
The U.S. enjoys a privileged position
in regard to investments because of the
dollar's dominance. "The U.S. gains
tremendously by being a leading power.
Other countries accumulate
dollars—paper-while we accumulate
real assets," Professor Gurley stated.
"The European nations will accept
this condition," Harry Cleaver

out of hand so to speak. The Med Center reported no injuries.
