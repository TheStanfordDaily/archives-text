## House Vote Revives SST 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) - The battle over
developing an American supersonic
transport plane was revived yesterday
when the House executed an about-face
and voted $85 million to restart the
project.
The Senate will take up the renewed
fight next and Democratic Leader Mike
Mansfield of Montana predicted the
outcome there will be close.
With the leaders of both parties in
the House behind them, backers of a
drive to breathe new life into the 1,800
mile-an-hour passenger plane won an
initial test by 201 to 195 and nailed it
down by 201 to 197 on a second vote.
Eight weeks ago they lost 215 to 204.
' Mansfield said the resurrection will
meet "very extended debate" in the
Senate, where the SST was killed two
months ago 51 to 46.
"It might be nip and tuck" this
time, Mansfield said.
In a statement, President Nixon
congratulated the House "for having
very wisely reversed their earlier
position," and added:
"The Congress has today taken an
important first step on behalf of
thousands of workers across the
country who have been engaged in the
SST program and whose vital skills and
experience might otherwise be lost to
the nation."
Nixon restated a pledge "that the
SST will not be committed to
production until all environmental
concerns have been thoroughly
satisfied."
The Boeing Company, which has
laid off more than 5,000 workers since
its contract to develop the aircraft was
canceled, said any attempt to
reconstruct the program must be on the
basis of an entirely new contract.
"This new contract must fully
recognize the rights of the parities
under the terminated contract and the
large costs which will be incurred in

re-establishing and carrying out the new
program," the company said.
Speaker Carl Albert of Oklahoma
told the House it would be foolish to
kill the plane after spending $1 billion
on it.
House Republican Leader Gerald R.
Ford of Michigan said Congress "was
acting in the dark" when it killed the
SST eight weeks ago and said the SST
workers who have been laid off since
then demanded that decision be
reversed.
But Rep. Sidney R. Yates, D-111., the
SST's leading House opponent, said

"The American people do not want the
SST."
The House vote turned an $85.c. 1
million contract termination fund for
the SST into that much money to
revive development of two prototype
planes.
Secretary of Transportation John A.
Volpe expressed pleasure at the House
action but said the question will not be
decided until the Senate acts.
"Meanwhile, we will continue
termination of the SST program
pending final action by Congress on the
supplemental appropriation bill,"
Volpe said.
