# Convocation Begins As BSU Holds Rally
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
Black Students' Union chairman
Willie Newberry challenged the white
community yesterday "to show us that
you want to discuss" and deal with
institutional racism at Stanford by
attending convocation classes planned
for the rest of the week.
Newberry spoke at noon on White
Plaza to a crowd of 150 to 200 people
attending the first rally of a BSU
convocation which lasts until Friday.
Beginning Friday a plebiscite will be
held concerning the Stanford
community's willingness to take stands
on institutional racism, imperialism,
and political victimization.
Police repression towards blacks was
the theme of two speeches by Diane
Fields, member of the recently elected
ASSU Council of Presidents, and Leo
Bazile, a former head of the BSU.
Aguibou Yansane, a graduate stydent
from Guinea, spoke on imperialism and
colonialism in Africa.
Fields asked the crowd to imagine
the "political victimization that
touches blacks every single solitary day
of their lives."
Phone Tapped
Her personal phone is tapped, she
says and added, "I have got white boys
sitting in front of my house (in East
Palo Alto) from seven in the morning
until two or three in the morning or
whenever I get back."
In his keynote speech for the
convocation, Newberry charged that
"If you are a black leader you are
guaranteed to be assassinated,
imprisoned, or killed." Citing past
examples he asked, "Why is it the
people who are opposed to racism are
stmt to jail?"
Institutional racism operates at
Stanford in part by turning the heads
of black students against other less
fortunate blacks. The kind of black
needed at Stanford should, he said,

"help them (black people) and not
disdain and despise them."
'Tired Of Facts'
In addition, the academic
environment works to restrain
blacks from taking action against what
they perceive is wrong, Newberry
charged. "I came here as a Woodrow
Wilson scholar," said Newberry, "and 1
was told you've got to be a social
analyst and you've got to get the facts.
And I'm tired of getting the facts."
Earlier Newberry questioned that
there even was an honest academic
atmosphere at Stanford. He told
students to challenge their professors to
give a "fifteen minute rap on what
institutional racism is."
"The black people of this nation are
looking at Stanford University today,"
he said, and they suspect that it is not
as good as it claims to be.
At 1:30 p.m. today there is a
discussion of institutional racism in the
Old Union Courtyard, with speakers
that include Religion Professor Robert
McAfee Brown and Leo Bazile.

In a related incident the Black
Students Union (BSU) yesterday
released a full statement on the arrests
of Ijeo Bazile, former BSU Chairman,
and Chris Laury, Black Liberation
Front member.
"The recent arrests and insane
charges brought against Chris Laury
and Leo Bazile appear to have
penetrated the sleepy Stanford
conscience. But the Stanford
