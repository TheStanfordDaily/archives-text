Editor, THE DAILY:
The Law School Film Society
having been accused of various
ignoble things, we'd like to set the
record straight. "Vixen" is one of
the best films of the nudie genre
and audiences enjoy it immensely.
Not showing it is the equal of a
ban of "Birth Of A Nation"

because of its allegedly anti-Black
message. In any case, the enlv
way to satify everyone is to show
only Walt Disney.
Assuming arguendo that
"Vixen" is exploitive of the fairer
sex, we have only been accused of
being Robin Hoods. The film
showing raised over $400 net for
students who need it far more
than the women. If they'd like to

picket our next "sexist" movie,
great! We're all in favor of
publicity.
The supposed benefit our
accuser cites is a net sum of
$400.00 raised this year from a
$10,000.00 gross. Quite a number
of minority law students will be
helped out by these funds.
Oh yes, the Society has both
male and famale sponsors, liberals
and conservatives,... We hope
we're setting an example for all
film societies and those students
who want to do something
constructive for this University.
