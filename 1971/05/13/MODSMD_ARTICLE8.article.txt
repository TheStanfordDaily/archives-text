# 'prophets of doom'
## False Optimism Misleading 
### 
Informed demographers and
ecologists have recently been
surprised to see the end of the
population explosion celebrated
in a spate of newspaper editorials
and columns. Headlines such as
"False Prophets of Doom,"
ridiculing those scientists
concerned about population
problems, have greeted readers
across the nation. The stimulus
for this outpouring has been
preliminary reports of the 1970
census, projecting an increase in
the American population of "as
little as" 75 million people by the
year 2000.
We do not quarrel with these
figures themselves; the census has
only reinforced conclusions
accepted in the demographic
literature for several years. But it
is difficult for us to understand
how a population increase of
some 35% in an already
overpopulated country can be
regarded as the conclusion of the
population explosion, especially
when the demographic situation
contains the potential for
substantial additional growth in
the next century. The optimists
should note that even if the
reproductive rate drops to the

replacement level by 1980, the
United States population will level
off at over 300 million in 2045. If
we should not reach replacement
level until the year 2000,
population growth will stop in
2065 with a final population size
of more than 350 million people.
The replacement level would
correspond to each female infant
bom today untimately producing,
on average, one female offspring
(that is, replacing herself).
Reaching this situation, defined
by demographers as NRR
exceeded 1.0. It will take 65 to 70
years (roughly the life
expectancy) following the
achievement of replacement
reproduction to reach ZPG in the
United States. The ballyhoo about
the end of the population
explosion notwithstanding, we
have notyet even reached
NRR=I.O (the 1967 figure was
1.213). Moreover, if the NRR
reaches unity, there is no
guarantee that it will remain
there.
Crude Index
Much attention in the press has
been focussed on the birth rate â€”
at best, a crude index of fertility
and an incomplete indicator of
the demographic situation. The
difference between the birth rate
(number of people being born per
thousand people in the population
per year) and the death rate
(number per thousand dying)
gives the natural rate of increase
for that year. Adding migration to
the calculation gives the overall
growth rate.
Some demographers, who
should know better, compound
the public's confusion both by

continuing to focus attention on
the birth rate alone and by
erroneously stating that it is now
at an all-time low. The fact is that
the Monthly Vital Statistics
Reports of the U.S. Public Health
Service show a bottoming of the
birth rate in late 1968 or early
1969, and a subsequent and
continuing increase. This came as
no surprise to those familiar with
the age structure of the
population (the relative numbers
of people in different age groups).
Specifically, the low birth rates of
the middle 1960s were due in part
to the small number of women in
their reproductive years. They
were the scarce wartime babies.

Now the abundant. World War II
boom babies have grown into
women who are moving into their
peak reproductive years. This
age-structure effect is causing a
predictable rise in the birth rate.
In view of the disconcerting
lack of public awareness regarding

these matters, one can draw three
conclusions: It is irresponsible for
any demographer to mislead the
public about the present birth
rates; it is unprofessional to
discuss birth rates outside the
context of the age structure; it is
inexcusable to omit from the
discussion the all-important
relationship between birth rate
and death rate in determining the
growth rate.
At the "all-time" low birth
rate, the U.S. population was
growing at about 1 percent per
year, with 80% of the growth
contributed by the difference
between birth and death rates,
and 20% by immigration. This
"slow" growth rate, if continued,
would double the population in
about 70 years. A little
elementary arithmetic shows that
such a rate is unsustainable for
any considerable period, even if
ecological and social factors are
ignored. But, of course, these
factors cannot be ignored. Most of
our environmental problems and
many of our social problems have
been and will continue to be
exacerbated by population
growth. That a fifty percent
increase in population will
stimulate a disproportionate
deterioration in many of these
problem areas adds to the urgency
of moving rapidly to zero
population growth and, ultimately
to a declining population size.
Go-Slow Program
The "responsible, orderly
approach" to NRR=I advocated
by many conservative
demographers and sociologists in
fact consists of a go-slow program
which condemns us to perhaps
another century of population
growth, as should be apparent
from the above discussion relating
NRR and ZPG. This attitude is
defended by references to
relatively easily managed social
problems arising from seeking a
stable population, and by a naive
under-estimation of problems in
resources and environment. If
these individuals are successful in
preventing our society and others
from taking enlightened voluntary
steps toward population control,
the most likely outcome is that
population will be "controlled"
automatically by a massive rise in
the death rate brought about by
war, plague, famine, ecosystem
collapse, or some combination of
these. Alternatively, by delaying
intelligent steps now, the go-slow
contingent increases the chances
that governments awakening too
late will institute repressive, racist,
or otherwise socially repugnant
measures.
To prevent such outcomes, we
should press by all acceptable
means to reduce the NRR below
1.0 as soon as possible, in the
hope of achieving ZPG by the end
of the century. Those journalists
who describe us in this advocacy
as "prophets of doom" would do
well to learn enough elementary
ecology and demography to be
able to discriminate prophets of
doom from those working to
avoid it.
