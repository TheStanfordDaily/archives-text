1. Whereas, racism, which is hopefully based mainly on ignorace, is respons
ible for many of America's present social problems and
Whereas, Stanford poses as an intelectually enlightened and morally respon
sible community:
He it highly resolved that the Stanford community abhors the racism and
imperialism inherent in the institution, Stanford and,
He it further resolved that implementation of the demands presented by
the Black community is the necessary first step toward ending racist in
equities inherent in the institution, Stanford.
2. Whereas previous, predominately white attempts at institutional reform
have been accompanied by minimal penalties for participants, and
Whereas the recent attempt at institutional reform, led and initiated by
Black people, was greeted by the most severe and repressive measures in
Stanford's history and,
Whereas for the first time bogus felony and misdemeanor charges were used
in an attempt to silence and discredit negotiatiors and supporters of
Black demands:
Be it highly resolved that the actions taken by Stanford in response to
Black demands are a discredit to the Stanford community;
Be it further resolved that Stanford, in order to correct injustices of
the past weeks, should utilize all means at its disposal to insure that
none of the Black demand negotiators and supporters be imprisoned, expel
led, or suspended.
