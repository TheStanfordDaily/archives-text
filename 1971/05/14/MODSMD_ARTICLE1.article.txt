# 'Daily' Asks Permanent Restraint Against Future Police Searches
## 
### HAAS EDWARDS 
The Daily yesterday filed suit in federal court asking
that the April 12 search of its offices by four Palo Alto
police officers be declared illegal and unconstitutional. The
suit also seeks a permanent injunction against future police
searches of the newspaper's offices.
Felicity Barringer, editor of the paper, told reporters
that the suit was filed "to demonstrate in court that the
search was a violation of our First, Fourth and Fourteenth
Amendment rights.
"We believe that unpublished information gathered
while reporting the news—be it notes, tape recordings or
photographs—is ours to keep confidential. To open such
unpublished information to the scrutiny of outside agencies
would, we feel, severely hamper the Daily's newsgathering
ability.
"(Such searches) would break down the relationship of
trust between newsmakers and newsgatherers that is so vital
to accurate and complete reportage," she said.
Could Set Precedent
Moving with a search warrant signed by Palo Alto
Municipal Court Judge J. Barton Phelps, the four Palo Alto
policemen thoroughly searched the Daily's offices looking
for evidence against participants in the violent April 9 clash
between police and demonstrators. After spending 45
minutes in the Daily offices, the officers left
empty-handed.
While searching the offices, the officers also went
through a filing cabinet belonging to the "Stanford Quad"
and desks containing personal correspondence of Daily
staff members.
Barringer said that the paper's legal counsel could find
no prior instances of police searches of newspaper offices
and that the Daily suit, if successful, will therefore be
precedent-setting.
Defendants named in thesuit, filed in U.S. District Court
in San Francisco, are Palo Alto Chief of Police James
Zurcher; the four Palo Alto Police Department officers who
participated in the search; Louis P. Bergna and Craig
Brown, the Santa Clara County District Attorney and
Deputy District Attorney, respectively; and Judge Phelos.

Plaintiffs in the action, other than Barringer, are
reporters Fred Mann, Hall Daily, Bob Litterman and Ed
Kohn and photographers Lee Greathouse and Steve Ungar.
Palo Alto City Attorney Peter Stone, who said he had
not seen the complaint, noted that the matter would be
brought up before the City Council. Stone said he expected
that the city would contest the suit.
"All of the procedures followed were well within
constitutional limits and were approved by the court,"
Stone said.
The defendants could not be reached for comment.
June 7 Hearing
Earlier, when questioned about the search, Zurcher and
Bergna said that they had no advance knowledge of the
search. Also, neither the Santa Clara County Sheriff- who
normally would control such matters nor University
officials were told of the search until it was well underway.
Robert H. Mnookin, one of the Daily's three attorneys,
said that the first hearing on the suit on a motion for
change of venue- would be June 7 in San Francisco. Other
attorneys for the paper are Jerome B. Falk Jr. and Law
School Professor Anthony Amsterdam, who is handling a
parallel case for New York Times reporter Earl Caldwell.
The suit asks the court to:
"... declare illegal and unconstitutional the search of
the offices of The Stanford Daily that took place on April
12,1971;
—. . permanently enjoin and restrain Defendants, their
agents, successors, employees, attorneys and those acting in
concert with them or at their direction, from seeking the
issuance of, issuing, or executing any warrant to search the
offices of The Stanford Daily, or the office or residence of
any of its staff members for any photographs, negatives,
films, reporters' notes, documents or any other material,
whether published or unpublished, taken, received,
developed or maintained in the course of efforts to gather
news, by any person who is a staff member of The Stanford
Daily;
. . order Defendants to pay Plaintiffs for counsel
fees and costs of suit;
". . . order such other relief as may seem just to the
Court under the circumstances of this case."
