We members of the
Organization of African Students
at Stanford, very much concerned
with the general welfare of the
B.S.U. membership and their
many problems of the time,
would like to reaffirm here our
total support and solidarity to
their demands and reparation
proposals.
We disapprove with apprehensive
concern the repressive attacks
carried out by the Santa Clara
County authorities with the
flagrant complicity of the
Stanford administration, on the
B.S.U. leaders, the B.S.U.
supporters and negotiators.
We believe that the enlightened
Stanford Community of Scholars
could provide more responsible
and realistic solutions to such vital
B.S.U. demands.
We also would like to take this
opportunity to express our
profound dissatisfaction and
long-standing concern over the
course offerings dealing with
African Studies at Stanford. We
strongly feel that the manner in
which most of these courses are
given in their present content,
outlook and approach tend to
alienate those very students for
whom they are the most relevant.

disillusioned
Editor, THE DAILY:
I write this letter in response to
a number of editorials and similar
letters that have appeared in the
Daily during the last few days. It
seems, in reviewing these articles,
that those writing are indeed very
disturbed not only about what is
happening here on the Stanford
campus, but also in terms of the
more serious, long-range
implications-i.e., how the
disturbances here reflect the
inherent "racism and imperialism"
which they claim infects this
institution.
I have attempted to read these
articles with an "open mind," if
thats what one calls self-imposed
impartiality, and yet I have
emerged sickened, disheartened,
and disillusioned with what I have
perceived is the point behind
them. It seems, if some of these
articles are any indication, that
the University has abandoned its
role as an intellectually
stimulating and thought
furthering institution and has
instead resorted to the lowest
form of persuasion that of
rhetoric.
I refer, for example, to the
column by Walter Hunkeler (May
7). He cites the charges against
Willie Newberry and Molly
Dougherty as the "admin
istration's response" to a
convocation on Racism implying
that because the two events are

related in terms of time, and
because race is involved, its
obviously some kind of University
attempt through "closed-door
proceedings" to "maintain the
racist, imperialist nature of this
university."
The rhetoric comes easily to
Mr. Hunkeler, and yet the solid
logic, or even the implied proof of
his assertion, fails to further any
intelligent strive for solving this
supposedly significant inequity.
Some display of this sort of
opinion is indeed necessary, yet
the abundance with which we are
bombarded is insulting to anyone
who tries to look at Stanford's
many problems with any degree
of non-emotional bias.
I refer in addition to a letter in
that same issue, that criticized the
Daily for "finding out" that a
white worker was attacked by
blacks, thus obviously implying
(using their logic) that all blacks
are terrorists, while at the same
time neglecting to "identify acts
of terrorism against the black
population," refering here to the
Junipero Lounge fire.
It matters not it seems to the
authors of this letter that the
determination of races
accompanies virtually every report
of assualt, terrorism, etc., and
that, unbelievable as it may seem,
there may indeed be some
correlation between the hospital
walkout led by the black workers
and the assualt on Mary Jane
Schmidt, who had often been
threatened in relation to that
walkout.
Nor does it matter it seems
that the FBI cannot even locate
the arsonists involved in the
Junipero assualt, let alone
establish their race or political
feelings. They ignore too that this
has pushed the Trustees (who are
busy forwarding their imperialistic
whims) to offer $5000 for the
capture of these arsonists.
If from what I have heard
about the "racist" Trustees in the
Daily is true, they are obviously
providing this money so that they
can reward the arsonists for
bombing the meeting place of the
BSU!! But this is irrelevant if
some other letters you have
printed are to be heeded, for we
must "look beyond" this
monetary reward to the true
problems of our society — the

exploitation of third world
peoples, racism, etc. etc. etc.
Maybe it is because I am only a
mere freshman that I have not yet
been shown the "true" way that
things are in this troubled world.
Maybe my hopes about
semi-intelligent, rational, and
immediate solutions to our
problems being possible here at
Stanford are all wrong. Maybe all
we can now do is see who can
forward the better rhetoric. I just
sort of hope that there's more to
these realistic problems than that,
and that there's still some hope
for the concept of a rational
solution to problems.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The proposal for development
of Stanford lands is a rip off. It
rips off the tax payers, the
surrounding communities, and
Stanford itself. Stanford real
estate planning office does not
know the rate of return on its
investment (Stanford could loose
money) or the present value.
Without knowing these factors, no
one should develop anything. In
turn, the taxpayers would pay
$20 million for the Willow
Freeway and several million more
for other services.
The Willow Freeway would
greatly increase air pollution and
also lead to intensive development
elsewhere in the foothills, bringing
more people into an already
saturated area. Stanford would
make a big contribution to
converting this region into
another Los Angeles. The freeway
would destroy a large segment of
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and
what beauty remains in San
Franciscito Creek. Increased
traffic congestion with attendant
lost time and increased gas
consumption would probably cost
local citizens more money in a
year than Stanford would make in
50. Stanford is not an isolated
island. It must consider the
imapct on its surroundings.
But on the other hand, we can
expect members of the Board of
Trustees to benefit personally
from a new industrial park as they
have in the current industrial

park. For them to decide on
matters such as this where they
and their friends can personally
profit is highly unethical, if not
corrupt.
What are the alternatives?
Building houses on the land has an
appeal because there is a shortage
of low income housing; however,
this area already had more
population than its ecology can
support. We cannot cope with the
waste and air pollution generated
by the present population.
Stanford should consider leasing
or selling the land to surrounding
communities to use as a park.
Stanford could possibly make as
much money as by developing the
land, the freeway would no longer
be needed, and the pollution
problem would not be increased.

I have attempted to read these
articles with an "open mind," if
thats what one calls self-imposed
impartiality, and yet I have
emerged sickened, disheartened,
and disillusioned with what I have
perceived is the point behind
them. It seems, if some of these
articles are any indication, that
the University has abandoned its
role as an intellectually
stimulating and thought
furthering institution and has
instead resorted to the lowest
form of persuasion that of
rhetoric.
I refer, for example, to the
column by Walter Hunkeler (May
7). He cites the charges against
Willie Newberry and Molly
Dougherty as the "admin
istration's response" to a
convocation on Racism implying
that because the two events are

related in terms of time, and
because race is involved, its
obviously some kind of University
attempt through "closed-door
proceedings" to "maintain the
racist, imperialist nature of this
university."
The rhetoric comes easily to
Mr. Hunkeler, and yet the solid
logic, or even the implied proof of
his assertion, fails to further any
intelligent strive for solving this
supposedly significant inequity.
Some display of this sort of
opinion is indeed necessary, yet
the abundance with which we are
bombarded is insulting to anyone
who tries to look at Stanford's
many problems with any degree
of non-emotional bias.
I refer in addition to a letter in
that same issue, that criticized the
Daily for "finding out" that a
white worker was attacked by
blacks, thus obviously implying
(using their logic) that all blacks
are terrorists, while at the same
time neglecting to "identify acts
of terrorism against the black
population," refering here to the
Junipero Lounge fire.
It matters not it seems to the
authors of this letter that the
determination of races
accompanies virtually every report
of assualt, terrorism, etc., and
that, unbelievable as it may seem,
there may indeed be some
correlation between the hospital
walkout led by the black workers
and the assualt on Mary Jane
Schmidt, who had often been
threatened in relation to that
walkout.
Nor does it matter it seems
that the FBI cannot even locate
the arsonists involved in the
Junipero assualt, let alone
establish their race or political
feelings. They ignore too that this
has pushed the Trustees (who are
busy forwarding their imperialistic
whims) to offer $5000 for the
capture of these arsonists.
If from what I have heard
about the "racist" Trustees in the
Daily is true, they are obviously
providing this money so that they
can reward the arsonists for
bombing the meeting place of the
BSU!! But this is irrelevant if
some other letters you have
printed are to be heeded, for we
must "look beyond" this
monetary reward to the true
problems of our society — the

exploitation of third world
peoples, racism, etc. etc. etc.
Maybe it is because I am only a
mere freshman that I have not yet
been shown the "true" way that
things are in this troubled world.
Maybe my hopes about
semi-intelligent, rational, and
immediate solutions to our
problems being possible here at
Stanford are all wrong. Maybe all
we can now do is see who can
forward the better rhetoric. I just
sort of hope that there's more to
these realistic problems than that,
and that there's still some hope
for the concept of a rational
solution to problems.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The proposal for development
of Stanford lands is a rip off. It
rips off the tax payers, the
surrounding communities, and
Stanford itself. Stanford real
estate planning office does not
know the rate of return on its
investment (Stanford could loose
money) or the present value.
Without knowing these factors, no
one should develop anything. In
turn, the taxpayers would pay
$20 million for the Willow
Freeway and several million more
for other services.
The Willow Freeway would
greatly increase air pollution and
also lead to intensive development
elsewhere in the foothills, bringing
more people into an already
saturated area. Stanford would
make a big contribution to
converting this region into
another Los Angeles. The freeway
would destroy a large segment of
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and
what beauty remains in San
Franciscito Creek. Increased
traffic congestion with attendant
lost time and increased gas
consumption would probably cost
local citizens more money in a
year than Stanford would make in
50. Stanford is not an isolated
island. It must consider the
imapct on its surroundings.
But on the other hand, we can
expect members of the Board of
Trustees to benefit personally
from a new industrial park as they
have in the current industrial

park. For them to decide on
matters such as this where they
and their friends can personally
profit is highly unethical, if not
corrupt.
What are the alternatives?
Building houses on the land has an
appeal because there is a shortage
of low income housing; however,
this area already had more
population than its ecology can
support. We cannot cope with the
waste and air pollution generated
by the present population.
Stanford should consider leasing
or selling the land to surrounding
communities to use as a park.
Stanford could possibly make as
much money as by developing the
land, the freeway would no longer
be needed, and the pollution
problem would not be increased.

time neglecting to "identify acts
of terrorism against the black
population," refering here to the
Junipero Lounge fire.
It matters not it seems to the
authors of this letter that the
determination of races
accompanies virtually every report
of assualt, terrorism, etc., and
that, unbelievable as it may seem,
there may indeed be some
correlation between the hospital
walkout led by the black workers
and the assualt on Mary Jane
Schmidt, who had often been
threatened in relation to that
walkout.
Nor does it matter it seems
that the FBI cannot even locate
the arsonists involved in the
Junipero assualt, let alone
establish their race or political
feelings. They ignore too that this
has pushed the Trustees (who are
busy forwarding their imperialistic
whims) to offer $5000 for the
capture of these arsonists.
If from what I have heard
about the "racist" Trustees in the
Daily is true, they are obviously
providing this money so that they
can reward the arsonists for
bombing the meeting place of the
BSU!! But this is irrelevant if
some other letters you have
printed are to be heeded, for we
must "look beyond" this
monetary reward to the true
problems of our society — the

exploitation of third world
peoples, racism, etc. etc. etc.
Maybe it is because I am only a
mere freshman that I have not yet
been shown the "true" way that
things are in this troubled world.
Maybe my hopes about
semi-intelligent, rational, and
immediate solutions to our
problems being possible here at
Stanford are all wrong. Maybe all
we can now do is see who can
forward the better rhetoric. I just
sort of hope that there's more to
these realistic problems than that,
and that there's still some hope
for the concept of a rational
solution to problems.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The proposal for development
of Stanford lands is a rip off. It
rips off the tax payers, the
surrounding communities, and
Stanford itself. Stanford real
estate planning office does not
know the rate of return on its
investment (Stanford could loose
money) or the present value.
Without knowing these factors, no
one should develop anything. In
turn, the taxpayers would pay
$20 million for the Willow
Freeway and several million more
for other services.
The Willow Freeway would
greatly increase air pollution and
also lead to intensive development
elsewhere in the foothills, bringing
more people into an already
saturated area. Stanford would
make a big contribution to
converting this region into
another Los Angeles. The freeway
would destroy a large segment of
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and
what beauty remains in San
Franciscito Creek. Increased
traffic congestion with attendant
lost time and increased gas
consumption would probably cost
local citizens more money in a
year than Stanford would make in
50. Stanford is not an isolated
island. It must consider the
imapct on its surroundings.
But on the other hand, we can
expect members of the Board of
Trustees to benefit personally
from a new industrial park as they
have in the current industrial

park. For them to decide on
matters such as this where they
and their friends can personally
profit is highly unethical, if not
corrupt.
What are the alternatives?
Building houses on the land has an
appeal because there is a shortage
of low income housing; however,
this area already had more
population than its ecology can
support. We cannot cope with the
waste and air pollution generated
by the present population.
Stanford should consider leasing
or selling the land to surrounding
communities to use as a park.
Stanford could possibly make as
much money as by developing the
land, the freeway would no longer
be needed, and the pollution
problem would not be increased.

disillusioned
Editor, THE DAILY:
I write this letter in response to
a number of editorials and similar
letters that have appeared in the
Daily during the last few days. It
seems, in reviewing these articles,
that those writing are indeed very
disturbed not only about what is
happening here on the Stanford
campus, but also in terms of the
more serious, long-range
implications-i.e., how the
disturbances here reflect the
inherent "racism and imperialism"
which they claim infects this
institution.
I have attempted to read these
articles with an "open mind," if
thats what one calls self-imposed
impartiality, and yet I have
emerged sickened, disheartened,
and disillusioned with what I have
perceived is the point behind
them. It seems, if some of these
articles are any indication, that
the University has abandoned its
role as an intellectually
stimulating and thought
furthering institution and has
instead resorted to the lowest
form of persuasion that of
rhetoric.
I refer, for example, to the
column by Walter Hunkeler (May
7). He cites the charges against
Willie Newberry and Molly
Dougherty as the "admin
istration's response" to a
convocation on Racism implying
that because the two events are

related in terms of time, and
because race is involved, its
obviously some kind of University
attempt through "closed-door
proceedings" to "maintain the
racist, imperialist nature of this
university."
The rhetoric comes easily to
Mr. Hunkeler, and yet the solid
logic, or even the implied proof of
his assertion, fails to further any
intelligent strive for solving this
supposedly significant inequity.
Some display of this sort of
opinion is indeed necessary, yet
the abundance with which we are
bombarded is insulting to anyone
who tries to look at Stanford's
many problems with any degree
of non-emotional bias.
I refer in addition to a letter in
that same issue, that criticized the
Daily for "finding out" that a
white worker was attacked by
blacks, thus obviously implying
(using their logic) that all blacks
are terrorists, while at the same
time neglecting to "identify acts
of terrorism against the black
population," refering here to the
Junipero Lounge fire.

Stanford are all wrong. Maybe all
we can now do is see who can
forward the better rhetoric. I just
sort of hope that there's more to
these realistic problems than that,
and that there's still some hope
for the concept of a rational
solution to problems.

land development
Editor, THE DAILY:
The proposal for development
of Stanford lands is a rip off. It
rips off the tax payers, the
surrounding communities, and
Stanford itself. Stanford real
estate planning office does not
know the rate of return on its
investment (Stanford could loose
money) or the present value.
Without knowing these factors, no
one should develop anything. In
turn, the taxpayers would pay
$20 million for the Willow
Freeway and several million more
for other services.
The Willow Freeway would
greatly increase air pollution and
also lead to intensive development
elsewhere in the foothills, bringing
more people into an already
saturated area. Stanford would
make a big contribution to
converting this region into
another Los Angeles. The freeway
would destroy a large segment of
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and
what beauty remains in San
Franciscito Creek. Increased
traffic congestion with attendant
lost time and increased gas
consumption would probably cost
local citizens more money in a
year than Stanford would make in
50. Stanford is not an isolated
island. It must consider the
imapct on its surroundings.
But on the other hand, we can
expect members of the Board of
Trustees to benefit personally
from a new industrial park as they
have in the current industrial

park. For them to decide on
matters such as this where they
and their friends can personally
profit is highly unethical, if not
corrupt.
What are the alternatives?
Building houses on the land has an
appeal because there is a shortage
of low income housing; however,
this area already had more
population than its ecology can
support. We cannot cope with the
waste and air pollution generated
by the present population.
Stanford should consider leasing
or selling the land to surrounding
communities to use as a park.
Stanford could possibly make as
much money as by developing the
land, the freeway would no longer
be needed, and the pollution
problem would not be increased.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Just a word on yesterday's
excellent write-up on the
COPE/Memorial Church matter.
To set the record straight, the
Memorial Church Committee of
faculty and staff was not
appointed by the Committee on
Committees. The members were
selected and asked to serve by the
Chapel staff, at the suggestion and
with the knowledge of the
chairman of the Committee on
Committees.
