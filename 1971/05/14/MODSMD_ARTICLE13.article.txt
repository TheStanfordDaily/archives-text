# Doobie Brothers Show Talent

### PROGRESS HORNSBY (THE DOOBIE BROTHERS. WARNER BROS. WS 1919) 
The Doobie Brothers are:
a.) a veterinary service in
Keokuk
b.) a midget tumbling act
c.) an accomplished rock band
from San Jose
d.) all of the above
Perceptive readers who note
that this column deals only
marginally with animal husbandry
(by occasionally stepping it it)
and feats of strength and
dexterity (stepping out of it) will
instantly select choice (c) and
they will be right!
The Doobie Brothers are
indeed an accomplished and
enjoyable group, on the Warner
Brothers label, who have
somehow made an album without
advocating or even mentioning the
use of false drugs!
Don't be put off by the
hard-guy album cover, which
seems to promise a tasts of
hob-nailed boots; it thankfully
doesn't reflect the blend of fine
voices, instruments and material
on the straightforward recording
inside.
Not Great Yet
The Doobie Brothers are not a
great band-yet. They do
however, stand head and
shoulders above most of the pap
that comes my way, which
prompts this review and
endorsement.
The record starts with perhaps
the best cut-"Nobody"-a sure shot
as a 45 and kind of ready-made
classic. It features the strong lead
singing of Tom Johnston, who
sounds something like Dave
Mason, percussive acoustic guitar,
good backup vocals and
instruments that remain the
successful formula for the rest of
the album.
The theme is varied by Gospel

tunes ("I believe the Master just
about to bring me home-" from
"The Master," and "Closer Every
Day"), Band-like country
("Greenwood Creek"), straight
blues ("Chicago"), a real rocker
(Randy Newman's "Beehive
State") and some modern
harmonies ("Traveling Man"). The
overall effect is that of variation
on a theme: versatility with a
direction. Material is selected
which compliments the
voices/instruments and vice-versa;
special effects are minimal, giving
the illusion of a great live
performance.
Never-Never Land
Well, you may ask, if these
guys are so good, how cum they
ain't rich? This unfortunately
takes us into the never-never land
of record promotion, and as all
who can remember "Indian Lake"
and "Chewy-Chewy" will attest,
pass and Bromo.
Record labels always have
many groups on hand to play
with, record, manage and
distribute; they follow the
shotgun approach, figuring to hit
with one if they shoot one
hundred. The record reviewer is
the testing ground for this
cornucopia of cretinous
caterwauling (courtesy of Spiggy);
the public hears only a fraction.
Even when a band makes the
first cut, as the Doobie Brothers
certainly will, whim and
circumstance will probably rule
their chance of making the big
money. (Last year a great record
by a group called the Edison
Electric Band died the true
death—no promotion). So get it

while you can. Your wallet is your
ballot.
(The preceding was an
unsolicited crank letter, and
should not be construed to be
anything more than the ramblings
of a diseased mind.)
ROCK ON
This weekend, Bill Graham's
moribund Fillmore West features
Humble Pie, Swamp Dogg, and
Shanti. Humble Pie is a British
group built around Steve Mariott,
the former Small Faces member
who gave us "Ithcykoo Park"
with its memorable "Feed the
ducks with a bun" lyric.
Nine Simone, the Chambers
Brothers, and the New Generation
Singers will be at the Oakland
Coliseum on Sunday night.
Elvin Bishop and Grootna
appear tonight at Keystone
Korner, where last weekend the
Doobie Brothers and Gabriel put
on an excellent performance.
If for some reason you're going
to be in Cotati this weekend, the
übiquitous Van Morrison awaits
you at the Inn of the Beginning.
Jackie De Shannon keeps
truckin' on at the Fairmont, while
Burt Lancaster makes his singing
debut in "Knickerbocker
Holiday" at the Curran Theater.
Johnny Cash is coming May 23
to Oakland Coliseum. That same
weekend, Sergio Mendes brings his
major 7th chords to the Circle
Star Theater.
And lastly, old "Sticky
Fingers" himself, Mick Jagger, got
married to a young lady named
Bianca. Frankly, I think he was
just using Marianne Faithfull.
