# Shakespeare Troupe Fills De Young Park
## 
### JANEEN OLSEN 
The theatre is one of the most
expressive and useful instruments
for building up a country; it is the
barometer of it's greatness or
decline. An intelligent theatre can
change the sensibility of a people
within a few years.
—Federico Garcia Lorca
So begins an article by Margrit
Roma on the goals of the New
Shakespeare Company, which she
directs. After spending a dynamic
afternoon talking with Clarence
Ricklefs, the producer, I realized
thev would settle for nothing less.
The New Shakespeare
Company gives free weekend
performances at De Young
Meadow in Golden Gate Park and
charge for their performances at
California high schools and
colleges. Presently, they are also
giving a few evening presentations
at theTrinity Episcopal Church in
San Francisco.
The company believes that
Shakespeare is in no way out of
date. On the contrary his plays
can be more shockingly modern
and relevant than Beckett or
lonesco. "We're going to do what
we want to do," says Clarence
Ricklefs after objecting to the
"warmed over Hollywood and
Broadway" which fills our
theaters today. And what they
want to do next is an anti-war
production of "Macbeth."
Most of the 25 members of the

company are from 19 to 26 years
old. Production duties of stage
manager, wardrobe mistress, etc.
are all divided up among the
actors. Each member receives a
regular monthly salary and they
find it necessary to live in small
groups near the Church because of
the time required by rehearsals
and training courses.
When it comes down to the
actual preparation of a play such
as "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
or "As You Like It" which are
playing now, work and study
become meticulously detailed.
Under the direction of Margrit
Roma, a credited European
actress, the lines of Shakespeare
are developed to the exact word
and only minor cutting is done to
keep the continuity of individual
characters.
If you haven't yet, I suggest
you get into the city and watch a
Shakespeare play or two. You'll
be surprised at the lack of
conventional props, for the
company does not believe in
trappings but rather in the
foundations of the play itself. Sit
in De Young Meadow with the
trees and lawn as an effective
stage; catch a few ad libs, and
some shockingly relevant four
hundred year old lines.

state of. .. " (Hamlet)

mortals be!" (A Midsummer
Night's Dream)

Most of the 25 members of the

company are from 19 to 26 years
old. Production duties of stage
manager, wardrobe mistress, etc.
are all divided up among the
actors. Each member receives a
regular monthly salary and they
find it necessary to live in small
groups near the Church because of
the time required by rehearsals
and training courses.
When it comes down to the
actual preparation of a play such
as "A Midsummer Night's Dream"
or "As You Like It" which are
playing now, work and study
become meticulously detailed.
Under the direction of Margrit
Roma, a credited European
actress, the lines of Shakespeare
are developed to the exact word
and only minor cutting is done to
keep the continuity of individual
characters.
If you haven't yet, I suggest
you get into the city and watch a
Shakespeare play or two. You'll
be surprised at the lack of
conventional props, for the
company does not believe in
trappings but rather in the
foundations of the play itself. Sit
in De Young Meadow with the
trees and lawn as an effective
stage; catch a few ad libs, and
some shockingly relevant four
hundred year old lines.

IN THE CLlNCH—Michael Bottero as Touchstone and Karen Kirk as
Audrey get acquainted in the New Shakespeare Company's
production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." The young actors
perform free of charge in the DeYoung Meadow.
The theatre is one of the most
expressive and useful instruments
for building up a country; it is the
barometer of it's greatness or
decline. An intelligent theatre can
change the sensibility of a people
within a few years.

So begins an article by Margrit
Roma on the goals of the New
Shakespeare Company, which she
directs. After spending a dynamic
afternoon talking with Clarence
Ricklefs, the producer, I realized
thev would settle for nothing less.
The New Shakespeare
Company gives free weekend
performances at De Young
Meadow in Golden Gate Park and
charge for their performances at
California high schools and
colleges. Presently, they are also
giving a few evening presentations
at theTrinity Episcopal Church in
San Francisco.
The company believes that
Shakespeare is in no way out of
date. On the contrary his plays
can be more shockingly modern
and relevant than Beckett or
lonesco. "We're going to do what
we want to do," says Clarence
Ricklefs after objecting to the
"warmed over Hollywood and
Broadway" which fills our
theaters today. And what they
want to do next is an anti-war
production of "Macbeth."
