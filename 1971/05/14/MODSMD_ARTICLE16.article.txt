# Stanford's Premier Batsman
## Boone Intimidates Pitchers 
### 
Earlier in the season,
Stanford's baseball team had
entered the prestigious Riverside
Intercollegiate Tournament which
attracted some of the top college
baseball teams in the country.
Teams like Kansas State and
Oklahoma, the best the Big Eight
has to offer, and, of course,
Arizona State, the most noted
baseball college in the country,
and the school that has given the
majors the likes of Sal Bando,
Reggie Jackson, and Rick
Monday.
The Indians have managed to
overcome a 13-4 shellacking
earlier in the tournament by
Arizona ' State, and earned the
right to face the Sun Devils again
in the championship game. Down
7-3 going into the ninth inning,
coach Ray Young was preparing
for the long ride home.
Miraculously, the Indians
poured across six runs in that final
frame to capture the title. The
man who drove home the winning
runs was the irrepressible Rod
Boone who slapped a two-out,
bases loaded double and batted
.563 for the tournament.
Young says of Boone, "He
really carried us through that
tournament and meant a lot to
the club early in the season. His
quick start helped bring along the
younger players and gave the team
a big lift."
Boone just kept accelerating
after his early takeoff, so much so
that he leads the Indians in no less
the nine offensive departments as
the season comes to a close. The
6'3", 190 lb. sophomore is batting
.383 and has broken four
Stanford single season marks:
most hits (76), most at bat (198),
most runs scored (49) and most
RBl's (45). He is also within reach
of the home record, being only
one behind Jim Hibb's record of
11.
Part of Boone's exceptional
performance must be attributed

to the extensive baseball
background that pervades his
whole family. Rod's father Ray
was a catcher in the major leagues
and played for the White Sox,
Indians, and the Tigers, and is
now a scout for the Boston Red
Sox.
In addition, his brother Bob
was an All-American third
baseman for Stanford, graduating
in 1969. In fact, Rod has just
broken two of Bob's records,
most hits and most at bats. Bob is
now in the Philadelphia Phillies
organization as a catcher, playing
class AA baseball.
Boone was contacted by the
major league scouts as soon as he
graduated from high school, but
the money wasn't enough to lure
him away from Stanford. In his
freshman year, Rod climbed from
the freshman squad to the varsity
and proceeded to bat .350 for the
rest of the season.
Boone attributed his
consistency and quick start at the
bat this year to more preparation
than he had ever done before with
his teammates, including hitting
practice every Sunday. In
addition, he worked with weights

in the off-season which added ten
pounds and extra power to his
frame.
He feels that this extra weight
"gave me more power and helped
cut down on overswinging and
going for the fences. The added
power meant that 1 didn't have to
swing as hard to get the same
results. I try to swing like a golfer,
keeping the same stroke every
time, whether the pitch is high or
low."
The consistency is obvious
when Boone's hitting streaks of
16 and 20 games are taken into
account along with the fact that
Rod has struck out only 25 times
in the 55 games played this year.
His position in the batting order,
behind Mike Nelson, and before
freshman phenom Mark Lucich,
has also afforded Rod a good
selection of pitches from opposing
hurlers who would have preferred
to pitch around him.
Defensively, Rod is quicker
than bis brother Bob whom the
scouts have felt was too slow to
play in the infield in the majors,
but he doesn't possess any
blinding speed. However, Boone
has an excellent arm, even
pitching for the Indians on
occasion, and will have to work
most on his defense after being
drafted.
And of being drafted Boone is
assured. However, he won't be
eligible for the baseball draft until
he graduates from Stanford or
next year when he reaches the age
of twenty-one, all of which is part
of a rule enacted by the baseball
owners this year.
At the present his main goal is
to help the team into the playoffs
and contribute to a team which he
feels "has come a long way with
so many young ballplayers and
has an excellent chance to go all
the way." The end of this season
is also certain to bring
All-American accolades and
continued drooling by the scouts.
