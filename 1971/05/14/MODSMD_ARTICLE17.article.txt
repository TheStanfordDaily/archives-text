# Cards Need Sweep For Playoff Chance
## 
### TOM QUINN 
The struggles of the PAC-8
baseball race come down to two
games for Stanford this weekend
as the Indians face Cal in a home
and home series. Coach Ray
Young's charges play Cal in
Berkeley at 2:30 p.m. on Friday,
and then host the Bears at the
same time in Sunken Diamond on
Saturday.
The Indians are cuirently two
games behind UCLA which holds
the second place spot with an
11-6 record. The Bruins must face
undefeated USC this weekend in
their last two league contests.
Two losses by UCLA and a sweep
for Stanford will put the Indians
in the playoffs since they hold an
edge over UCLA in the season
series.
Reflecting on the big weekends
in Los Angeles and at home,
Young felt, "USC has to be going
all out for a perfect season, but in
those two parks, one mistake by a
pitcher will give the other team
the game.
"Our pitching is stronger and
Mike Nelson and Glen Johnson
have come alive at the bat since
last weekend, so we'll be all set
for Cal. If we make the playoffs,
we have a good chance to go all
the way because we certainly have
the depth to take three or four
games in a row. We seem to play
better away from when we only
have baseball on our mind."
If the cards fall into place,
Stanford will fly to the northern
division site on Thursday to take
on the first place team in that
division, possibly Oregon which
holds a halfgame lead over WSU
and sports a rather unenviable 6-8

record compared to the Indians'
9-6 slate.
Young plans on throwing Dan
Shaw (11-4) and Bob Kammeyer
(8-5) against the Bears who are
languishing in last place in the
southern division with a 5-10
record.
California, led by the .372
batting average of first baseman
Gary Hernandez, will provide a
challenge for Stanford's pitchers
however. The Indians will
probably have to face the aces of
the Cal staff, Ray Del Carlo (4 -0)
and Doak Moore (4 -2 ).
