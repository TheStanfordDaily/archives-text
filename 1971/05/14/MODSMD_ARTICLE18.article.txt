# Golfers Compete In Pac-8 Meet
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
In their most important
weekend of competition thus far
this season, the Indian golfers face
UCLA tomorrow at home after
which they will travel to Eugene
to play in the three day long Pac-8
Championships beginning on
Sunday.
A victory over the Bruins will
give Coach Bud Finger's team an
undefeated record in the Southern
Division of the Pac-8. This
regional crown would probably
merit Stanford an invitation to
the NCAA Championships
regardless of the squad's showing
in the Pac-8 meet.
Tom Watson has been shooting
incredible golf the past few weeks
and will lead the team into the
UCLA match with an aggregate of
seven strokes under par in his last
four competitive rounds on the
Stanford Golf Course.
The Indians split a pair of

matches last week against San
Jose State and Cal. Playing at San
Jose, the linksters failed to break
SJS's jinx over them and lost their
second dual match of the year, 18
1/2-8 1/2. John Beers, undefeated
in match play this season, shot a
one over par 73 to take low
honors for the Cards.
Stanford rolled over Cal for the
second time this year last

Saturday at home by the score of
40-14. The win raised the Indian's
dual match mark to 9-2, with the
only two losses inflicted by San
Jose State.
Defending champions in the
Pac-8 meet, the Cards have won
the event twice in the last three
years and are favored to
successfully defend their title this
season.
