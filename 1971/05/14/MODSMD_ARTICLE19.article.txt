# Swim Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
UCLA will be favored to win
the team title in the sixth annual
Stanford Women's Invitational
Swimming Meet to be held
tomorrow at the women's pool,
according to Mrs. Marianna
Fowler, Stanford women's coach
and meet director.
UCLA, which did not enter a
team in last year's meet in
sympathy with the student strike
against the Cambodian invasion,
will take over the favorite's role
on the basis of strong
performances in the National

Intercollegiate Swimming and
Diving Championships held in
March.
Santa Clara University, which
won the team title last year, will
not return to defend their
championship. Participants from
Cal State Los Angeles, Cal State
Long Beach, USC, UC Santa
Barbara and the University of
Oregon will join the favored Uclan
and Stanford competitors in the
12-event meet, with preliminaries
beginning at 10:00 a.m., and
finals at 3:00 p.m.
