# More Students To Join Two-Year ROTC Program
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
Because of contractual obligations
additional students will be allowed to
enter the two-year Army ROTC
program next fall. Provost William F.
Miller said yesterday, although that
action will "run contrary" to action
taken by the faculty last June.
According to President Richard
Lyman, this will not, however, affect
the final termination date of ROTC at
Stanford -June, 19 73.
Miller released to the Faculty Senate
yesterday contents of the report from
the President's Advisory Committee on
ROTC Affairs on the two-year program
and the President's letter to the
chairman of that committee.
'Legal Obligation'
President Lyman said in the letter,
"It is the view of our attorneys that the
agreement with the Army in October,
197 0 to phase out ROTC by means of
ending freshman admissions does not
remove the University's (legal)
obligation to continue to make
available those levels of the program
not yet reached by the phase out."
Next fall the University will offer
third and fourth year Military Science
for students already enrolled in Army
ROTC. University attorneys feel,
therefore, that by the contract with the
Department of Defense it "must accept
students eligible for training at that
level. In the following year, only fourth
year Military Science will remain.
Autumn, 1971 will, therefore, be the
last year in which students will be
eligible for admission to the two-year
program," according to Lyman.
Under the ruling about a dozen
additional students who have so far
applied may enroll for the final two
years of the ROTC program. The total
includes two groups: 1) graduate and
transfer students who started four-year
ROTC programs elsewhere and want to
complete them while attending
Stanford, and 2) those desiring to take
a two-year Army ROTC program.
The Advisory Committee said in its
May 6 report, "this Committee finds
that the proposed enrollments run
contrary to the position of the
Academic Council." However, the
committee said that enrollment in the
two-year program next year "would
not fundamentally affect the main
thrust of the recommendations of June
1 , 19 70 , namely, the phase-out of
military instruction programs."
The committee also allowed that it
has "not investigated the question of
Stanford's obligations under its
contract with the Department of the
Army, but takes note of its existence."
Lyman said he agreed with the main
conclusion of the Committee that "in
the absence of contractual obligations
and allowing for cases of individual
hardship, admission of new students to
third year Military Science, whether as
transfers or in the two-year program,
would be contrary to the Academic
Council action of last summer."
Because of his agreement with this,
he noted that allowing the two-year
program "will disappoint some on

campus" but he said he hoped that
'"their disappointment will not cloud
their view of the central fact of the
ROTC situation namely, that the
program's termination date remains, as
it was, June, 1 9 73."
The Advisory Committee noted that
at the present time five students who
are transfer students and incoming
graduate students who began their
ROTC training elsewhere wish to enroll
in the ROTC here at the third-year level

and that six continuing Stanford
students and incoming transfer or
graduate students wish to enroll in the
ROTC program.
Questions about the enrollments in
the two year program and the
continuing program were initially raised
several weeks ago by a group of
students from Columbae House.
There are currently about 65
students enrolled in the Army ROTC
program.
