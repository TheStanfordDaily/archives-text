# Netmen Face Cal
## 
### 
In their final tune-up the Pac-8
championships, the Stanford
tennis team plays Cal here on
Saturday at 11:30 a.m.
After last week's shutout wins
over Seattle and Washington,
Stanford's record was 15-2.
Number one man for the Indians
Roscoe Tanner led the way in
both matches as he defeated Mike
Prinias of Seattle 6-1, 6-4, and
Don Beer of Washington 7-6, 6-1.
Though the Bears don't have

the overall strength of Stanford,
they could cause some trouble.
Against the nation's best tennis
team, UCLA, Cal took two
matches when the Bruins played
them at Berkeley. The Card
netmen could only salvage one
match from UCLA in the two
matches they played.
The team travels to Oregon
State on Thursday for the Pac-8
championships which will run
through Saturday.
