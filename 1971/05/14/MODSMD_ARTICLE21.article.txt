# Tenure Study, New Major
## 
### 
The Faculty Senate yesterday ordered its Committee on Committees to
"consider the desirability of establishing at this time one or more committees to
study and recommend changes" in such areas as the ranks of faculty, taculty
tenure, and the means of appointing and promoting members of the faculty.
The Senate instructed the Committee to report back on the feasibility of
establishing any committee by October 1, 1971, and, "if deemed advisable, a
means of empaneling and charging" the committee or committees.
The sweeping charge to the Committee on Committees allows it to consider
studying the entire faculty structure-the ranks, criteria, and procedures for
appointing, reappointing, and promoting members of the faculty.
The length of terms of appointment, the effects upon academic freedom and
academic responsibility of faculty appointments; retirement ages of
faculty—including early and mandatory retirement; relations among faculty,
administrative and staff appointment policies as to terms of appointment and of
retirement ages; and "such other matters as may bear directly upon the foregoing
considerations."
The action does not establish any committees but only authorizes the
Committee on Committees to study the "desirability of establishing" any bodies
to study the issues.
The faculty Senate yesterday also approved the establishment of an
interdepartmental major on the undergraduate level in Mathematical Sciences.
The program, which has 60 required units and 12 units of electives, "provides a
core of mathematics basic to all of the mathematical sciences, an introduction to
the concepts and techniques of computer science, operations research, and
statistics," according to Mathematics Professor Paul W. Berg.
The program is intended to prepare students either for graduate study in the
mathematical sciences or for work in the "contemporary" applied mathematics
which is concerned with applications to the behavioral sciences and management
(and also to some extend to the biological sciences).
This area of applied mathematics is "centered around high-speed computers
and utilizes in addition to mathematics proper and computer science the concepts
and techniques of statistics and operations research."
