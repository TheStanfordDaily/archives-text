Plebiscite Monday
The Black Students Union plebiscite of the
Stanford community has been put off until next
Monday. Its two resolutions, which appear in an
advertisement in today's Daily ask support for the
recently issued black demands as first steps towards
eliminating racial inequities at Stanford.
An informal discussion of issues raised during the
BSU convocation this week will be held today from
3:00-4:30 p.m. in Tresidder 282. St. Clair Drake,
head of the Black Studies Program, Raymond
Bachetti, Associate Provost, and Henry Organ of the
General Secretary's Office will take part.
ASSU Blasts Reagan
The ASSU Council of Presidents in a letter sent to
Governor Reagan, condemned his assertion that the
Junipero lounge fire was the work of a
"self-proclaimed revolutionary."
"There has been no information released," the
letter states, "that would implicate any particular
political group with that act. The dormitory is 20
percent black. The black residents have been
harrassed repeatedly in the form of bomb threats and
crank phone calls. Rather than revolutionary, the
impetus of this sick act may well have been racism.
"We, however, will make no attempt to indict any
group in public before all of the facts are known.
Time and time again, we listen to politicians using
"scare" tactics to bolster their own position. That
type of political maneuvering is also violent; it does
violence to the concept of democracy and the peoples
right to hear the truth."
The letter advises the Governor that if he has any
information to offer in the case, it should be
"communicated to the proper authorities and not
through a public harangue."

Ali To Speak
Muhammed Ali, former world heavyweight title
holder, will be a guest of the Black Students Union at
a press conference scheduled for 11:00 a.m. Friday,
May 21, in the Large Lounge of TMU.
After remarks by Leo Bazile, former BSU
co-chairman, and Willie Newberry, current BSU
chairman, Ali will be available for questions. He will
comment on current campus events and his own
personal life at a meeting scheduled for 12:00 noon
May 21 in Frost, open to the public free of charge.
His appearance at Stanford is sponsored by the
Associated Students Special Events Board and the
BSU.
China Night
The annual China Night, a cultural program
presented to the Stanford Community by Stanford
Chinese students, will take place this year at
Dinkelspiel Auditorium on May 15, Saturday, starting
at 8:00 p.m. The program will include classical
Chinese instrumental music by Mr. D.T. Lee, one of
the few great pi-pa players in the world, and by Mr.
David Liang, an accomplished musician with the S.F.
Conservatory of Music; Chinese Folk Dances by Miss
Chiang Ch'ing, a well-known dancer trained in Peking
who is also an acclaimed Chinese movie actress; and
an exposition of Chinese Martial Arts by Professor
Jew of S.F. State University. A report will also be
made about the Tiao Yu Tai Defense Student
Movement. Admission is free.
Land Hearings Delayed
Trustees of Stanford believe it would be premature
for the board or its committee on land development

to hold open hearings on the Livingston report at this
time, Vice President Kenneth M. Cuthbertson
reported yesterday.
Open hearings have already been held and are still
being scheduled by the University Committee on
Land Development, headed by Prof. David Mason,
which will make its recommendations to President
Lyman. In addition, numerous meetings have been
held and are planned between University officers and
representatives of neighboring governmental
jurisdictions and organizations, he said.
This process will not be completed until well into
the fall. Most local governments are not yet in a
position to respond to issues in the Livingston report
which directly affect them. Cuthbertson said that
because it would be premature for the board to hold
any kind of a hearing until the interested parties are
prepared to convey their views, it will again review
the desirability of seeking direct testimony this fall.
Demonstrators Guilty
Ten of the 13 Stanford students cited at the April
22 anti-draft demonstration in San Jose were found
guilty yesterday on charges of general trespassing and
intentional interference with a lawful business.
The 10 demonstrators, pleading not guilty,
charged that the Selective Service Bureau was not a
lawful business. They also challenged the
constitutionality of the Vietnam War. Judge Arvin
Robb dismissing the challenges of the defense,
proceeded to lecture the defendants on the
constitutionality of the Selective Service Act and his
personal experience with the draft in 1942. A number
of students walked out of the courtroom as the judge
issued the verdict.
The defendants will be sentenced today
