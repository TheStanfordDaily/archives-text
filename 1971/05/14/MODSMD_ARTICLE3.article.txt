# Expressway Termed 'Necessary For Growth'
## 
### BOB BACON 
According to a confidential Division of Highways report, recently obtained by
the Citizens Against The Willow Expressway, the proposed expressway is
necessary to increase the development potential of the Stanford foothills.
The 75 page report states that "the expressway can contribute to the area's
future development." It also asserts that the growth "can occur in the following
manner: More intense development of Stanford University properties ..."
It also states that "land values have been steadily increasing in the area to the
point where it is very difficult to economically justify constructing low-cost
housing or even maintaining the low-cost housing stock which currently exists."
The report was unveiled last night at a meeting of the citizens group at the
Willow School in Menlo Park by Peter Sly who managed to obtain a photocopy
through several intermediaries. It was reproduced from a copy of the original
report held by John C. Beckett, Hewlett-Packard Corporation's representative to
the state Chamber of Commerce. Sly had requested a copy from the Division of
Highways but was told it was not available to the public.
The proposed expressway would approximately follow the Menlo
Park-Stanford and Menlo Park-Palo Alto boundary from Interstate Highway 280
near the Stanford Linear Accelerator to the Dumbarton Bridge.
Development Inevitable
"Some further development of the (Midpeninsula) area appears inevitable and if
no further transportation facilities are provided, intolerable traffic conditions may
arise. The proposed expressway will provide one of the necessary services that will
allow the anticipated development to take place in such a manner as not to
degrade the current quality of life," the report says.
The introduction to the report, under the heading of "Socio-economic
Consequences," states that the major economic development of the Midpeninsula
area in the immediate future will occur on Stanford lands and in Palo Alto. This is
"due to the availability of developable land and the growth aspirations of the
controlling governing bodies," according to the report.
"Stanford University has a great potential to increase economic development
and job opportunities by maximizing the utilization of its lands.. . Future
population increases in the study area will depend heavily on Stanford's use of its
land. . . Stanford, based on its Policy/Plan employment projections, can
contribute new employment ranging from a minimum of approximately 7700 to a
maximum of approximately 14,000."
The Division of Highways report, entitled Community and Environmental
Factors Report/Willow Expressway, also stated that "it is estimated that by the
year 1990, Palo Alto will provide in excess of three jobs for every employable
resident."
Housing Situation
The report dwelt at considerable length on the housing situation which would
be created by the expressway, which would displace occupants of from 268 to
428 dwelling units. It recommended that "the state sponsor the construction of a
limited number of low to moderate cost rental units in Palo Alto," in addition to
its proposals for Menlo Park.
The report recommends that the expressway not be routed through an area of
low-income housing in East Menlo Park, because replacement housing could not
be guaranteed for the occupants of 160 apartments which would be demolished.
During last night's meeting, attended by about 50 Menlo Park residents, Sly
was asked whether the decision not to uproot tenants of the East Menlo Park
apartment buildings was related to President Richard Lyman's interest in housing.
He felt that there was such a connection.
Menlo Park residents will vote September 14 in an advisory referendum on the
expressway proposal.
If the expressway is approved, by the State Highway Commission, construction
is not expected to start for five to eight years.
