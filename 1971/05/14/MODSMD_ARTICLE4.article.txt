# Greer Advocates Dual Revolution
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Commentary
Germaine Greer sprang from the cover of Life
Magazine onto the pavement of White Plaza yesterday
and received a generally favorable reaction from the
more than 200 people who gathered to hear her call
for a revolution, both sexual and economic.
The Australian-born feminist is currently being
toured about the country to publicize her book, The
Female Eunuch. Citing the dehumanization of both
men and women by the present "sexo-economic
system," she vociferously espouses revolution and
states that the oppression of women and suppression
of men will end only when "the dying beast of
capitalism" finally kicks off.
The original purpose of her noontime appearance,
she stated, was "to get some soul back from the
people." This aim was frustrated by the size of the
large crowd which came to hear her. She termed it "a
Nuremburg rally situation."
Condemns Hostility
Instead, she noted that her talk would be followed
by a BSU rally, and spoke on the relationship
between black liberation and women's liberation. She
condemned the conflict between black militants and
feminists as "the type of hostility between oppressed
exploited by the oppressor."
"Women's liberation must make its case so clear
and so unambiguous that it can be reconciled with all
other revolutionary forces," she added.
Conceding the black argument—that black men
must finally assert their male role—she held that, "if
the soul power and energy of the black women who
have had to bring their children up alone ... is turned
into a black version of the white-feminist (Eldridge)
Cleaver wrote about, it would represent the
corruption of a genuinely revolutionary force."

Much of her words extolled revolution, and it was
on this subject that she lost many of her listeners.
Several students, including radicals and moderates,
noted that her belief in revolution sounded more
rhetorical than sincere.
Tina Swent, who ran for the ASSU Presidency on
a women's rights platform, spoke with Greer and
afterwards commended, "She's really strange. She
kept talking about how the overthrow of capitalism
would free women . . . and how the Soviet Union was
just state capitalism and we had to move on to true
communism. But she seemed incredibly naive about
it. It's a bad pun, but she's fucked politically."
After her White Plaza appearance, Greer invaded
what many consider the last bastion of Stanford's
unliberated dolly—Storey House—for lunch and a talk
with a smaller group of students.
Teaches Literature
Greer seemed more comfortable with the living
room atmosphere of her Storey conversation, perhaps

because it was more like the classroom situation she is
accustomed to as a teacher of English literature at
Warwick University in England.
Some 50 people asked her questions and gave her
the feedback on her answers that she had requested.
She talked for some time on "the difference between
fucking and making love," a theme she had touched
upon in White Plaza.
"In Portnoy's Complaint, Portnoy is not a freak,"
she declared, holding that Portnoy's problem is
archetypal. Trained to "make love to organs, not
people ... he tries to relate to a real woman and is
really still masturbating. When we make love to a
fantasy or an organ, we are all involved in
auto-eroticism," she concluded.
Spurns Polarity
Greer spurns the male against female polarity set
up by some feminists. "The belief that men are
biologically unnecessary is fascist," she stated in
White Plaza. "If we adopt that concept we've
swallowed the worst part of the shit the system has
handed down to us—that people have to justify their
existence. Existence is a right."
She also rejects the stereotype of feminists as
women "in battle dress, grimly searching down every
trace of sexism .. . vigilantes who tear rapists limb
from limb." Instead she prefers "the joy of a
revolutionary movement, the complete involvement
in something you believe in."
Greer commented in White Plaza that the
commercialization of rock music had robbed the
counter culture of its music. In response to a question
at Storey, she conceded that she was currently
undergoing the same type of commercialization by
the mass media. "But," she countered, "I've written
my book, thank God. My words have been
encapsulated where they hopefully will survive long
after my head is fucked over."

Conceding the black argument—that black men
must finally assert their male role—she held that, "if
the soul power and energy of the black women who
have had to bring their children up alone ... is turned
into a black version of the white-feminist (Eldridge)
Cleaver wrote about, it would represent the
corruption of a genuinely revolutionary force."

Much of her words extolled revolution, and it was
on this subject that she lost many of her listeners.
Several students, including radicals and moderates,
noted that her belief in revolution sounded more
rhetorical than sincere.
Tina Swent, who ran for the ASSU Presidency on
a women's rights platform, spoke with Greer and
afterwards commended, "She's really strange. She
kept talking about how the overthrow of capitalism
would free women . . . and how the Soviet Union was
just state capitalism and we had to move on to true
communism. But she seemed incredibly naive about
it. It's a bad pun, but she's fucked politically."
After her White Plaza appearance, Greer invaded
what many consider the last bastion of Stanford's
unliberated dolly—Storey House—for lunch and a talk
with a smaller group of students.
Teaches Literature
Greer seemed more comfortable with the living
room atmosphere of her Storey conversation, perhaps

because it was more like the classroom situation she is
accustomed to as a teacher of English literature at
Warwick University in England.
Some 50 people asked her questions and gave her
the feedback on her answers that she had requested.
She talked for some time on "the difference between
fucking and making love," a theme she had touched
upon in White Plaza.
"In Portnoy's Complaint, Portnoy is not a freak,"
she declared, holding that Portnoy's problem is
archetypal. Trained to "make love to organs, not
people ... he tries to relate to a real woman and is
really still masturbating. When we make love to a
fantasy or an organ, we are all involved in
auto-eroticism," she concluded.
Spurns Polarity
Greer spurns the male against female polarity set
up by some feminists. "The belief that men are
biologically unnecessary is fascist," she stated in
White Plaza. "If we adopt that concept we've
swallowed the worst part of the shit the system has
handed down to us—that people have to justify their
existence. Existence is a right."
She also rejects the stereotype of feminists as
women "in battle dress, grimly searching down every
trace of sexism .. . vigilantes who tear rapists limb
from limb." Instead she prefers "the joy of a
revolutionary movement, the complete involvement
in something you believe in."
Greer commented in White Plaza that the
commercialization of rock music had robbed the
counter culture of its music. In response to a question
at Storey, she conceded that she was currently
undergoing the same type of commercialization by
the mass media. "But," she countered, "I've written
my book, thank God. My words have been
encapsulated where they hopefully will survive long
after my head is fucked over."

LADIES' LlB—Feminist C.ermaine Greer, speaking at Storey House, advocated
political and sexual revolution yesterday as well as promoting her book, 'The
Female Eunuch."
Commentary
Germaine Greer sprang from the cover of Life
Magazine onto the pavement of White Plaza yesterday
and received a generally favorable reaction from the
more than 200 people who gathered to hear her call
for a revolution, both sexual and economic.
The Australian-born feminist is currently being
toured about the country to publicize her book, The
Female Eunuch. Citing the dehumanization of both
men and women by the present "sexo-economic
system," she vociferously espouses revolution and
states that the oppression of women and suppression
of men will end only when "the dying beast of
capitalism" finally kicks off.
The original purpose of her noontime appearance,
she stated, was "to get some soul back from the
people." This aim was frustrated by the size of the
large crowd which came to hear her. She termed it "a
Nuremburg rally situation."
Condemns Hostility
Instead, she noted that her talk would be followed
by a BSU rally, and spoke on the relationship
between black liberation and women's liberation. She
condemned the conflict between black militants and
feminists as "the type of hostility between oppressed
exploited by the oppressor."
"Women's liberation must make its case so clear
and so unambiguous that it can be reconciled with all
other revolutionary forces," she added.
Conceding the black argument—that black men
must finally assert their male role—she held that, "if
the soul power and energy of the black women who
have had to bring their children up alone ... is turned
into a black version of the white-feminist (Eldridge)
