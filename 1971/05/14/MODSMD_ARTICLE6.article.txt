# Lyman's Commitment?

Dear President Lyman:
We are very disappointed in the apparent lack of
response on your part concerning the Black
Students Union Convocation on Institutional
Racism at Stanford. Ordinarily such a skirting of the
issue would not concern us, except for the fact the
administration has made its position clear in the
past when the issues were of a different nature. For
example, last year there were statements from the
administration concerning both the Environmental
Teach-in and the anti-war rally in Frost.
We believe that the lack of response is indicative
of either a shallow interest in the which
affect racial groups on this campus, or perhaps more
accurately a genuine inability to deal with the
questions of racism. Within this construct we cannot
help but view with suspicion your well publicized
desire to post bail for a well-known Black, and yet
not to make a public comment on a Convocation
dealing with the issue which this particular Black
has dedicated his activities to. This is much like
taking the publicity value of a man without ever

seriously dealing with his substance.
We as a Council of Presidents have made our
position clear to the community. We endorse such
an educational program dealing with the issue of
racism; we have attempted to aid the BSU in any
way to insure the success of such a Convocation.
And lastly, we have informed the Stanford
community as to where we stand on the
Convocation resolutions. We are unequivocably
against racism in any form and therefore must vote
in favor of the resolutions.
Therefore we as a Council call upon the President
of our University to make his position on the issues
clear. We feel that it is his duty not only to be in
favor of the Convocation but to aid it; and above
all, he should at least attend, which to our
knowledge he has not. We also call upon the
President to inform the entire community on how
he intends to vote concerning the plebiscite
resolutions, be it positive or negative and the
reasons behind his vote.
ASSU Council of Presidents
