## Time To Rethink Radicalism?

''Market Street Tieup Fizzles"
that was the way last
Wednesday's Examiner described
Mayday in San Francisco. What
was supposed to be a highpoint of
the Spring Offensive winds up a
frustrated traffic jam? For a
number of us who participated,
this does seem to be one time in
which the newspaper report of a
radical protest demonstration
borders on accuracy. This is not
to say that the day was without
positive value, for it marked an
important attempt to focus
anti-war attention on the major
war-making role of U.S.
corporations and to coordinate
the movements of an array of Bay
Area radical groups in something
other than a march down the
street.
However, the shortcomings of
last week's activities were
immediately evident and it is, I
think, time that those opposed to
the war in Vietnam begin to
reconsider, in light of the events
of Mayday, both the specific
tactical problems of such protest
actions and the general directions
in which the "anti-war
Movement" appears to be moving.
Police Maneuvers
It may, at the start, be
instructive to look briefly at the
methods of those who
commanded the city last
Wednesday, i.e., the police. Using
minibikes, motorcycles, cars, and
horses, the police held control
throughout the day by riding
closely alongside demonstrators,
often jabbing into the crowd with
clubs swinging.
A favorite police maneuver for
some time now has been to rush
into a fleeing group, isolate and
beat a small number of people
(see the front page photograph of
last Thursday's Daily), and then
continue pursuing the mass of
frightened protestors. Through

their continuous, well-organized
movements, the police easily
suceed in keeping demonstrators
nervous, fearful, and in disarray.
No Punishment
The police seldom have serious
difficulty shattering any
demonstration, no matter how
peaceful it may be, for they are
ever raising the level of threatened
injury to protesters. The police
have little to fear, the protesters
consoling everything.
Just as the police riot at the
Chicago Convention and the
murders at People's Park, Jackson
State, and Kent State all passed
without a single guilty policeman
or National Guardsman being
jailed, so do the routine police
beatings of demonstrators today
elicit only passing mention in
press coverage.
The substantial escalation in
the intensity and extent of the
police and military response to
protest has been paralleled by the
escalated rhetoric of "liberal"
politicians, on and off campus.
The most recent rationalizations
were provided by Mayor Joseph
Alioto last Tuesday. "Our
definition of violence includes the
physical obstruction of any street,
sidewalk, or public entrance to a
building."
And our own Richard Lyman
recently declared sit-ins an
"unacceptable" form of protest
that cannot be tolerated. (Why
the Nobel Prize Committee should
have awarded Rev. Martin Luther
King, master of such civil
disobedience tactics as the sit-in,
its Peace Prize will apparently be
forever shrouded in mystery.)
Small wonder that such monthly
redefinitions of the word
"violence" have rendered its
meaning so vague and ephemeral
as to be unintelligible.
Concerned Liberals
Recognizing that the police
invariably have the upper hand in
anti-war demonstrations, what
have those of us who claim to be
so passionately opposed to the
war done in response? A number
have joined (assuming they ever
actually left) the ranks of
concerned liberals who, opposing
whatever suits their particular
definition of "violence," limit
themselves mainly to signing
occassional petitions, or to
strolling along on one or two
"safe" marches, or to the
comfortable inactivity so
characteristic of student-faculty
vegetables. A few others have
taken to individual, sporadic acts
such as bombings.
But, many others have

continued using the same tactics
of relatively peaceful disruption
which, with some variations, have
really changed little in the past
four years (unless one regards
their seemingly decreased
effectiveness this year as a
change). There definitely was a
concerted effort in the
Washington Mayday protests to
direct the activities of a large
number of local groups toward a
coordinated disruption of
"business as usual" in the Capitol.
However, 12,000 arrests later, it is
clear that something went wrong.
Active Opposition?
What went wrong in
Washington and in San Francisco
may be partially visible, in
microcosm at Stanford. Active
opposition to the Vietnam War on
this campus can generally be said
to fall under two headings:
disorganized or nonexistent. That
so many supposedly "educated"
people at this University can still
casually ignore the American-led
and financed slaughter of millions
of Asian peasants is, perhaps, a
matter best left to psychologists
and priests.
Some, enthralled by the
wonders of communes, sensitivity
sessions, and all the equipment of
the New Life Style child, are
simply too busy concoling one
another over the spiritual-in
tellectual anguish of the
middle-class student to be
bothered with uncouth "politics."
Planetary significance is to be
found in dope and ink drawings.
Others have no excuses at all.
Those who have engaged in
various forms of active radical
protest have, despite the
importance of such protest, been
unable or unwilling to combine
into the cohesive, permanent units
required by the administration's
increasingly aggressive actions
against demonstrators. Indeed, at
a time when discontent over
domestic and foreign policy has
almost never been so widespread,
radical groups remain just that -
"groups" of individuals without
real coherence or discipline and
thus largely unable to decide and
act effectively upon carefully
considered plans for anti-war
activity.
Organization Failure
There have seldom if ever been
attempts at Stanford (with the
possible exception of
Venceremos) to form anything
more stable than loose ad hoc
committees or even looser
discussion projects in which the
campus' many unaffiliated leftists
come temporarily together in

Grove lounge to discuss why it is
that they have come together.
It should be painfully clear to
all of us by now that rugged
individualism of the radical
variety, just as much as fervent
devotion to non-programs for
magically altered consciousness a
la Charles Reich, will only serve to
preserve the disorganized nature
of protest actions (to which police
tac squads owe much of their
deadly effectiveness) and to deter
more people away from active
opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
It is time, then, that we begin
seriously considering and acting
upon a few, basic issues: 1. While
the majority of radicals still cling
mainly to earlier forms of protest,
military, government, corporate,
and academic institutions have
coordinated their own forces to
an unprecedented degree in
increasingly powerful and
injurious acts against
demonstrators. The extent of
disorganization on the Left is so
severe that there has been almost
no attempt to imitate, much less
to refine, some of the more
successful tactics long-employed
by radicals in Paris and Berlin.
The building of elaborate street
barricades to allow people some
room in which to maneuver away
from rampaging police, and the
reliance (though only on a small
scale) on trained units, each
numbering 10 to 20 male and
female members, to rescue
individual protesters attacked by
police provide, at the very least, a
small measure of the
organizational security so
necessary for the physical safety
of demonstrates, and so lacking
in America. If large-scale
disruptive tactics are to be a viable
form of protest at this time, we
must have more in our arsenal
than spontaneous enthusiasm.
2. The attempts to counter
anti-radical actions by means of a
political organization, internally
cohesive and with a sizeable,
broadly representative
membership, have thus far met
with considerable opposition, not
only from liberals, but from a few
sources on the Left as well.
There sometimes appears to be
a peculiar fascination, often
evident within and between
anti-war groups at Stanford, with
the sort of senseless personal
criticisms which Mao Tse-Tung
denounced, in his Military
Writing, ("On Correcting Mistaken
Ideas in the Party") as "a
manifestation of petty-bourgeois
individualism." American radicals,
a good deal less organized than
the Red Army, can scarcely afford
more internal divisiveness.
Vanguardism
Also, there has for some time
been a handful of groups suffering
from premature exclusivity, in
that their desire to be labeled the
premier vanguard party has often
clouded the urgent need to
attract, through continual
education and organization, the
large numbers of people who
alone can provide a base for the
mass protest action of which
scattered, closed "affinity groups"
are incapable. It is encouraging
that this fact has now been
recognized even by Weatherman,
in the recent communique "New
Morning — Changing Weather"
(see David Horowitz's discussion
in the March, 1971, Ramparts).
3. Finally, it is one of the
outstanding advantages of
genuinely radical analyses that
they realize the interconnected
ness of American counter-insur
gency (not only in Vietnam, of
course, but throughout the world)
and the basic interests of the U.S.
power structure. Many liberals,
unwilling to recognize the past
decades of U.S. —supported
counter-revolutionary activities as
something more than unfortunate
"accidents" of otherwise
honorable and selfless government
and corporate policy-makers, may
be quite content with temporary
and loosely-organized "dovish"
reform groups.
Radicals, however, cannot. If
nothing else, I have tried to
suggest here, however sketchily,
that mass protest actions of the
type planned for Washington, San
Francisco, and several other cities
last week inevitably suffered from
the predominantly unorganized
and unprepared nature of the
scores of local groups which
composed them.
Radicalism, by the very depth
and scope of its analysis and its
hopes for a just social order,
demands the kind of long-term
organization which those of us at
Stanford have not as yet
established. We had best begin to
do so quickly.

of conversations between Greg
DeFreitas and I)ru Cornell, both
of whom are radical students
here.)

in which the "anti-war
Movement" appears to be moving.
Police Maneuvers
It may, at the start, be
instructive to look briefly at the
methods of those who
commanded the city last
Wednesday, i.e., the police. Using
minibikes, motorcycles, cars, and
horses, the police held control
throughout the day by riding
closely alongside demonstrators,
often jabbing into the crowd with
clubs swinging.
A favorite police maneuver for
some time now has been to rush
into a fleeing group, isolate and
beat a small number of people
(see the front page photograph of
last Thursday's Daily), and then
continue pursuing the mass of
frightened protestors. Through

their continuous, well-organized
movements, the police easily
suceed in keeping demonstrators
nervous, fearful, and in disarray.
No Punishment
The police seldom have serious
difficulty shattering any
demonstration, no matter how
peaceful it may be, for they are
ever raising the level of threatened
injury to protesters. The police
have little to fear, the protesters
consoling everything.
Just as the police riot at the
Chicago Convention and the
murders at People's Park, Jackson
State, and Kent State all passed
without a single guilty policeman
or National Guardsman being
jailed, so do the routine police
beatings of demonstrators today
elicit only passing mention in
press coverage.
The substantial escalation in
the intensity and extent of the
police and military response to
protest has been paralleled by the
escalated rhetoric of "liberal"
politicians, on and off campus.
The most recent rationalizations
were provided by Mayor Joseph
Alioto last Tuesday. "Our
definition of violence includes the
physical obstruction of any street,
sidewalk, or public entrance to a
building."
And our own Richard Lyman
recently declared sit-ins an
"unacceptable" form of protest
that cannot be tolerated. (Why
the Nobel Prize Committee should
have awarded Rev. Martin Luther
King, master of such civil
disobedience tactics as the sit-in,
its Peace Prize will apparently be
forever shrouded in mystery.)
Small wonder that such monthly
redefinitions of the word
"violence" have rendered its
meaning so vague and ephemeral
as to be unintelligible.
Concerned Liberals
Recognizing that the police
invariably have the upper hand in
anti-war demonstrations, what
have those of us who claim to be
so passionately opposed to the
war done in response? A number
have joined (assuming they ever
actually left) the ranks of
concerned liberals who, opposing
whatever suits their particular
definition of "violence," limit
themselves mainly to signing
occassional petitions, or to
strolling along on one or two
"safe" marches, or to the
comfortable inactivity so
characteristic of student-faculty
vegetables. A few others have
taken to individual, sporadic acts
such as bombings.
But, many others have

continued using the same tactics
of relatively peaceful disruption
which, with some variations, have
really changed little in the past
four years (unless one regards
their seemingly decreased
effectiveness this year as a
change). There definitely was a
concerted effort in the
Washington Mayday protests to
direct the activities of a large
number of local groups toward a
coordinated disruption of
"business as usual" in the Capitol.
However, 12,000 arrests later, it is
clear that something went wrong.
Active Opposition?
What went wrong in
Washington and in San Francisco
may be partially visible, in
microcosm at Stanford. Active
opposition to the Vietnam War on
this campus can generally be said
to fall under two headings:
disorganized or nonexistent. That
so many supposedly "educated"
people at this University can still
casually ignore the American-led
and financed slaughter of millions
of Asian peasants is, perhaps, a
matter best left to psychologists
and priests.
Some, enthralled by the
wonders of communes, sensitivity
sessions, and all the equipment of
the New Life Style child, are
simply too busy concoling one
another over the spiritual-in
tellectual anguish of the
middle-class student to be
bothered with uncouth "politics."
Planetary significance is to be
found in dope and ink drawings.
Others have no excuses at all.
Those who have engaged in
various forms of active radical
protest have, despite the
importance of such protest, been
unable or unwilling to combine
into the cohesive, permanent units
required by the administration's
increasingly aggressive actions
against demonstrators. Indeed, at
a time when discontent over
domestic and foreign policy has
almost never been so widespread,
radical groups remain just that -
"groups" of individuals without
real coherence or discipline and
thus largely unable to decide and
act effectively upon carefully
considered plans for anti-war
activity.
Organization Failure
There have seldom if ever been
attempts at Stanford (with the
possible exception of
Venceremos) to form anything
more stable than loose ad hoc
committees or even looser
discussion projects in which the
campus' many unaffiliated leftists
come temporarily together in

Grove lounge to discuss why it is
that they have come together.
It should be painfully clear to
all of us by now that rugged
individualism of the radical
variety, just as much as fervent
devotion to non-programs for
magically altered consciousness a
la Charles Reich, will only serve to
preserve the disorganized nature
of protest actions (to which police
tac squads owe much of their
deadly effectiveness) and to deter
more people away from active
opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
It is time, then, that we begin
seriously considering and acting
upon a few, basic issues: 1. While
the majority of radicals still cling
mainly to earlier forms of protest,
military, government, corporate,
and academic institutions have
coordinated their own forces to
an unprecedented degree in
increasingly powerful and
injurious acts against
demonstrators. The extent of
disorganization on the Left is so
severe that there has been almost
no attempt to imitate, much less
to refine, some of the more
successful tactics long-employed
by radicals in Paris and Berlin.
The building of elaborate street
barricades to allow people some
room in which to maneuver away
from rampaging police, and the
reliance (though only on a small
scale) on trained units, each
numbering 10 to 20 male and
female members, to rescue
individual protesters attacked by
police provide, at the very least, a
small measure of the
organizational security so
necessary for the physical safety
of demonstrates, and so lacking
in America. If large-scale
disruptive tactics are to be a viable
form of protest at this time, we
must have more in our arsenal
than spontaneous enthusiasm.
2. The attempts to counter
anti-radical actions by means of a
political organization, internally
cohesive and with a sizeable,
broadly representative
membership, have thus far met
with considerable opposition, not
only from liberals, but from a few
sources on the Left as well.
There sometimes appears to be
a peculiar fascination, often
evident within and between
anti-war groups at Stanford, with
the sort of senseless personal
criticisms which Mao Tse-Tung
denounced, in his Military
Writing, ("On Correcting Mistaken
Ideas in the Party") as "a
manifestation of petty-bourgeois
individualism." American radicals,
a good deal less organized than
the Red Army, can scarcely afford
more internal divisiveness.
Vanguardism
Also, there has for some time
been a handful of groups suffering
from premature exclusivity, in
that their desire to be labeled the
premier vanguard party has often
clouded the urgent need to
attract, through continual
education and organization, the
large numbers of people who
alone can provide a base for the
mass protest action of which
scattered, closed "affinity groups"
are incapable. It is encouraging
that this fact has now been
recognized even by Weatherman,
in the recent communique "New
Morning — Changing Weather"
(see David Horowitz's discussion
in the March, 1971, Ramparts).
3. Finally, it is one of the
outstanding advantages of
genuinely radical analyses that
they realize the interconnected
ness of American counter-insur
gency (not only in Vietnam, of
course, but throughout the world)
and the basic interests of the U.S.
power structure. Many liberals,
unwilling to recognize the past
decades of U.S. —supported
counter-revolutionary activities as
something more than unfortunate
"accidents" of otherwise
honorable and selfless government
and corporate policy-makers, may
be quite content with temporary
and loosely-organized "dovish"
reform groups.
Radicals, however, cannot. If
nothing else, I have tried to
suggest here, however sketchily,
that mass protest actions of the
type planned for Washington, San
Francisco, and several other cities
last week inevitably suffered from
the predominantly unorganized
and unprepared nature of the
scores of local groups which
composed them.
Radicalism, by the very depth
and scope of its analysis and its
hopes for a just social order,
demands the kind of long-term
organization which those of us at
Stanford have not as yet
established. We had best begin to
do so quickly.

of conversations between Greg
DeFreitas and I)ru Cornell, both
of whom are radical students

''Market Street Tieup Fizzles"
that was the way last
Wednesday's Examiner described
Mayday in San Francisco. What
was supposed to be a highpoint of
the Spring Offensive winds up a
frustrated traffic jam? For a
number of us who participated,
this does seem to be one time in
which the newspaper report of a
radical protest demonstration
borders on accuracy. This is not
to say that the day was without
positive value, for it marked an
important attempt to focus
anti-war attention on the major
war-making role of U.S.
corporations and to coordinate
the movements of an array of Bay
Area radical groups in something
other than a march down the
street.
However, the shortcomings of
last week's activities were
immediately evident and it is, I
think, time that those opposed to
the war in Vietnam begin to
reconsider, in light of the events

consoling everything.
Just as the police riot at the
Chicago Convention and the
murders at People's Park, Jackson
State, and Kent State all passed
without a single guilty policeman
or National Guardsman being
jailed, so do the routine police
beatings of demonstrators today
elicit only passing mention in
press coverage.
The substantial escalation in
the intensity and extent of the
police and military response to
protest has been paralleled by the
escalated rhetoric of "liberal"
politicians, on and off campus.
The most recent rationalizations
were provided by Mayor Joseph
Alioto last Tuesday. "Our
definition of violence includes the
physical obstruction of any street,
sidewalk, or public entrance to a
building."
And our own Richard Lyman
recently declared sit-ins an
"unacceptable" form of protest
that cannot be tolerated. (Why
the Nobel Prize Committee should
have awarded Rev. Martin Luther
King, master of such civil
disobedience tactics as the sit-in,
its Peace Prize will apparently be
forever shrouded in mystery.)
Small wonder that such monthly
redefinitions of the word
"violence" have rendered its
meaning so vague and ephemeral
as to be unintelligible.
Concerned Liberals
Recognizing that the police
invariably have the upper hand in
anti-war demonstrations, what
have those of us who claim to be
so passionately opposed to the
war done in response? A number
have joined (assuming they ever
actually left) the ranks of
concerned liberals who, opposing
whatever suits their particular
definition of "violence," limit
themselves mainly to signing
occassional petitions, or to
strolling along on one or two
"safe" marches, or to the
comfortable inactivity so
characteristic of student-faculty
vegetables. A few others have
taken to individual, sporadic acts
such as bombings.
But, many others have

continued using the same tactics
of relatively peaceful disruption
which, with some variations, have
really changed little in the past
four years (unless one regards
their seemingly decreased
effectiveness this year as a
change). There definitely was a
concerted effort in the
Washington Mayday protests to
direct the activities of a large
number of local groups toward a
coordinated disruption of
"business as usual" in the Capitol.
However, 12,000 arrests later, it is
clear that something went wrong.
Active Opposition?
What went wrong in
Washington and in San Francisco
may be partially visible, in
microcosm at Stanford. Active
opposition to the Vietnam War on
this campus can generally be said
to fall under two headings:
disorganized or nonexistent. That
so many supposedly "educated"
people at this University can still
casually ignore the American-led
and financed slaughter of millions
of Asian peasants is, perhaps, a
matter best left to psychologists
and priests.
Some, enthralled by the
wonders of communes, sensitivity
sessions, and all the equipment of
the New Life Style child, are
simply too busy concoling one
another over the spiritual-in
tellectual anguish of the
middle-class student to be
bothered with uncouth "politics."
Planetary significance is to be
found in dope and ink drawings.
Others have no excuses at all.
Those who have engaged in
various forms of active radical
protest have, despite the
importance of such protest, been
unable or unwilling to combine
into the cohesive, permanent units
required by the administration's
increasingly aggressive actions
against demonstrators. Indeed, at
a time when discontent over
domestic and foreign policy has
almost never been so widespread,
radical groups remain just that -
"groups" of individuals without
real coherence or discipline and
thus largely unable to decide and
act effectively upon carefully
considered plans for anti-war
activity.
Organization Failure
There have seldom if ever been
attempts at Stanford (with the
possible exception of
Venceremos) to form anything
more stable than loose ad hoc
committees or even looser
discussion projects in which the
campus' many unaffiliated leftists
come temporarily together in

Grove lounge to discuss why it is
that they have come together.
It should be painfully clear to
all of us by now that rugged
individualism of the radical
variety, just as much as fervent
devotion to non-programs for
magically altered consciousness a
la Charles Reich, will only serve to
preserve the disorganized nature
of protest actions (to which police
tac squads owe much of their
deadly effectiveness) and to deter
more people away from active
opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
It is time, then, that we begin
seriously considering and acting
upon a few, basic issues: 1. While
the majority of radicals still cling
mainly to earlier forms of protest,
military, government, corporate,
and academic institutions have
coordinated their own forces to
an unprecedented degree in
increasingly powerful and
injurious acts against
demonstrators. The extent of
disorganization on the Left is so
severe that there has been almost
no attempt to imitate, much less
to refine, some of the more
successful tactics long-employed
by radicals in Paris and Berlin.
The building of elaborate street
barricades to allow people some
room in which to maneuver away
from rampaging police, and the
reliance (though only on a small
scale) on trained units, each
numbering 10 to 20 male and
female members, to rescue
individual protesters attacked by
police provide, at the very least, a
small measure of the
organizational security so
necessary for the physical safety
of demonstrates, and so lacking
in America. If large-scale
disruptive tactics are to be a viable
form of protest at this time, we
must have more in our arsenal
than spontaneous enthusiasm.
2. The attempts to counter
anti-radical actions by means of a
political organization, internally
cohesive and with a sizeable,
broadly representative
membership, have thus far met
with considerable opposition, not
only from liberals, but from a few
sources on the Left as well.
There sometimes appears to be
a peculiar fascination, often
evident within and between
anti-war groups at Stanford, with
the sort of senseless personal
criticisms which Mao Tse-Tung
denounced, in his Military
Writing, ("On Correcting Mistaken
Ideas in the Party") as "a
manifestation of petty-bourgeois
individualism." American radicals,
a good deal less organized than
the Red Army, can scarcely afford
more internal divisiveness.
Vanguardism
Also, there has for some time
been a handful of groups suffering
from premature exclusivity, in
that their desire to be labeled the
premier vanguard party has often
clouded the urgent need to
attract, through continual
education and organization, the
large numbers of people who
alone can provide a base for the
mass protest action of which
scattered, closed "affinity groups"
are incapable. It is encouraging
that this fact has now been
recognized even by Weatherman,
in the recent communique "New
Morning — Changing Weather"
(see David Horowitz's discussion
in the March, 1971, Ramparts).
3. Finally, it is one of the
outstanding advantages of
genuinely radical analyses that
they realize the interconnected
ness of American counter-insur
gency (not only in Vietnam, of
course, but throughout the world)
and the basic interests of the U.S.
power structure. Many liberals,
unwilling to recognize the past
decades of U.S. —supported
counter-revolutionary activities as
something more than unfortunate
"accidents" of otherwise
honorable and selfless government
and corporate policy-makers, may
be quite content with temporary
and loosely-organized "dovish"
reform groups.
Radicals, however, cannot. If
nothing else, I have tried to
suggest here, however sketchily,
that mass protest actions of the
type planned for Washington, San
Francisco, and several other cities
last week inevitably suffered from
the predominantly unorganized
and unprepared nature of the
scores of local groups which
composed them.
Radicalism, by the very depth
and scope of its analysis and its
hopes for a just social order,
demands the kind of long-term
organization which those of us at
Stanford have not as yet
established. We had best begin to
do so quickly.

of conversations between Greg
DeFreitas and I)ru Cornell, both

''Market Street Tieup Fizzles"
that was the way last
Wednesday's Examiner described
Mayday in San Francisco. What
was supposed to be a highpoint of
the Spring Offensive winds up a
frustrated traffic jam? For a
number of us who participated,
this does seem to be one time in
which the newspaper report of a
radical protest demonstration
borders on accuracy. This is not
to say that the day was without
positive value, for it marked an
important attempt to focus
anti-war attention on the major
war-making role of U.S.
corporations and to coordinate
the movements of an array of Bay
Area radical groups in something
other than a march down the
street.
However, the shortcomings of
last week's activities were
immediately evident and it is, I
think, time that those opposed to
the war in Vietnam begin to
reconsider, in light of the events
of Mayday, both the specific
tactical problems of such protest
actions and the general directions
in which the "anti-war
Movement" appears to be moving.
Police Maneuvers
It may, at the start, be
instructive to look briefly at the
methods of those who
commanded the city last
Wednesday, i.e., the police. Using
minibikes, motorcycles, cars, and
horses, the police held control
throughout the day by riding
closely alongside demonstrators,
often jabbing into the crowd with
clubs swinging.
A favorite police maneuver for
some time now has been to rush
into a fleeing group, isolate and
beat a small number of people
(see the front page photograph of
last Thursday's Daily), and then
continue pursuing the mass of
frightened protestors. Through

their continuous, well-organized
movements, the police easily
suceed in keeping demonstrators
nervous, fearful, and in disarray.
No Punishment
The police seldom have serious
difficulty shattering any
demonstration, no matter how
peaceful it may be, for they are
ever raising the level of threatened
injury to protesters. The police
have little to fear, the protesters
consoling everything.
Just as the police riot at the
Chicago Convention and the
murders at People's Park, Jackson
State, and Kent State all passed
without a single guilty policeman

Small wonder that such monthly
redefinitions of the word
"violence" have rendered its
meaning so vague and ephemeral
as to be unintelligible.
Concerned Liberals
Recognizing that the police
invariably have the upper hand in
anti-war demonstrations, what
have those of us who claim to be
so passionately opposed to the
war done in response? A number
have joined (assuming they ever
actually left) the ranks of
concerned liberals who, opposing
whatever suits their particular
definition of "violence," limit
themselves mainly to signing
occassional petitions, or to
strolling along on one or two
"safe" marches, or to the
comfortable inactivity so
characteristic of student-faculty
vegetables. A few others have
taken to individual, sporadic acts
such as bombings.
But, many others have

continued using the same tactics
of relatively peaceful disruption
which, with some variations, have
really changed little in the past
four years (unless one regards
their seemingly decreased
effectiveness this year as a
change). There definitely was a
concerted effort in the
Washington Mayday protests to
direct the activities of a large
number of local groups toward a
coordinated disruption of
"business as usual" in the Capitol.
However, 12,000 arrests later, it is
clear that something went wrong.
Active Opposition?
What went wrong in
Washington and in San Francisco
may be partially visible, in
microcosm at Stanford. Active
opposition to the Vietnam War on
this campus can generally be said
to fall under two headings:
disorganized or nonexistent. That
so many supposedly "educated"
people at this University can still
casually ignore the American-led
and financed slaughter of millions
of Asian peasants is, perhaps, a
matter best left to psychologists
and priests.
Some, enthralled by the
wonders of communes, sensitivity
sessions, and all the equipment of
the New Life Style child, are
simply too busy concoling one
another over the spiritual-in
tellectual anguish of the
middle-class student to be
bothered with uncouth "politics."
Planetary significance is to be
found in dope and ink drawings.
Others have no excuses at all.
Those who have engaged in
various forms of active radical
protest have, despite the
importance of such protest, been
unable or unwilling to combine
into the cohesive, permanent units
required by the administration's
increasingly aggressive actions
against demonstrators. Indeed, at
a time when discontent over
domestic and foreign policy has
almost never been so widespread,
radical groups remain just that -
"groups" of individuals without
real coherence or discipline and
thus largely unable to decide and
act effectively upon carefully
considered plans for anti-war
activity.
Organization Failure
There have seldom if ever been
attempts at Stanford (with the
possible exception of
Venceremos) to form anything
more stable than loose ad hoc
committees or even looser
discussion projects in which the
campus' many unaffiliated leftists
come temporarily together in

Grove lounge to discuss why it is
that they have come together.
It should be painfully clear to
all of us by now that rugged
individualism of the radical
variety, just as much as fervent
devotion to non-programs for
magically altered consciousness a
la Charles Reich, will only serve to
preserve the disorganized nature
of protest actions (to which police
tac squads owe much of their
deadly effectiveness) and to deter
more people away from active
opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
It is time, then, that we begin
seriously considering and acting
upon a few, basic issues: 1. While
the majority of radicals still cling
mainly to earlier forms of protest,
military, government, corporate,
and academic institutions have
coordinated their own forces to
an unprecedented degree in
increasingly powerful and
injurious acts against
demonstrators. The extent of
disorganization on the Left is so
severe that there has been almost
no attempt to imitate, much less
to refine, some of the more
successful tactics long-employed
by radicals in Paris and Berlin.
The building of elaborate street
barricades to allow people some
room in which to maneuver away
from rampaging police, and the
reliance (though only on a small
scale) on trained units, each
numbering 10 to 20 male and
female members, to rescue
individual protesters attacked by
police provide, at the very least, a
small measure of the
organizational security so
necessary for the physical safety
of demonstrates, and so lacking
in America. If large-scale
disruptive tactics are to be a viable
form of protest at this time, we
must have more in our arsenal
than spontaneous enthusiasm.
2. The attempts to counter
anti-radical actions by means of a
political organization, internally
cohesive and with a sizeable,
broadly representative
membership, have thus far met
with considerable opposition, not
only from liberals, but from a few
sources on the Left as well.
There sometimes appears to be
a peculiar fascination, often
evident within and between
anti-war groups at Stanford, with
the sort of senseless personal
criticisms which Mao Tse-Tung
denounced, in his Military
Writing, ("On Correcting Mistaken
Ideas in the Party") as "a
manifestation of petty-bourgeois
individualism." American radicals,
a good deal less organized than
the Red Army, can scarcely afford
more internal divisiveness.
Vanguardism
Also, there has for some time
been a handful of groups suffering
from premature exclusivity, in
that their desire to be labeled the
premier vanguard party has often
clouded the urgent need to
attract, through continual
education and organization, the
large numbers of people who
alone can provide a base for the
mass protest action of which
scattered, closed "affinity groups"
are incapable. It is encouraging
that this fact has now been
recognized even by Weatherman,
in the recent communique "New
Morning — Changing Weather"
(see David Horowitz's discussion
in the March, 1971, Ramparts).
3. Finally, it is one of the
outstanding advantages of
genuinely radical analyses that
they realize the interconnected
ness of American counter-insur
gency (not only in Vietnam, of
course, but throughout the world)
and the basic interests of the U.S.
power structure. Many liberals,
unwilling to recognize the past
decades of U.S. —supported
counter-revolutionary activities as
something more than unfortunate
"accidents" of otherwise
honorable and selfless government
and corporate policy-makers, may
be quite content with temporary
and loosely-organized "dovish"
reform groups.
Radicals, however, cannot. If
nothing else, I have tried to
suggest here, however sketchily,
that mass protest actions of the
type planned for Washington, San
Francisco, and several other cities
last week inevitably suffered from
the predominantly unorganized
and unprepared nature of the
scores of local groups which
composed them.
Radicalism, by the very depth
and scope of its analysis and its
hopes for a just social order,
demands the kind of long-term
organization which those of us at
Stanford have not as yet
established. We had best begin to
do so quickly.

DeFreitas and I)ru Cornell, both

''Market Street Tieup Fizzles"
that was the way last
Wednesday's Examiner described
Mayday in San Francisco. What
was supposed to be a highpoint of
the Spring Offensive winds up a
frustrated traffic jam? For a
number of us who participated,
this does seem to be one time in
which the newspaper report of a
radical protest demonstration
borders on accuracy. This is not
to say that the day was without
positive value, for it marked an
important attempt to focus
anti-war attention on the major
war-making role of U.S.
corporations and to coordinate
the movements of an array of Bay
Area radical groups in something
other than a march down the
street.
However, the shortcomings of
last week's activities were
immediately evident and it is, I
think, time that those opposed to
the war in Vietnam begin to
reconsider, in light of the events
of Mayday, both the specific
tactical problems of such protest
actions and the general directions
in which the "anti-war
Movement" appears to be moving.
Police Maneuvers
It may, at the start, be
instructive to look briefly at the
methods of those who
commanded the city last
Wednesday, i.e., the police. Using
minibikes, motorcycles, cars, and
horses, the police held control
throughout the day by riding
closely alongside demonstrators,
often jabbing into the crowd with
clubs swinging.
A favorite police maneuver for
some time now has been to rush
into a fleeing group, isolate and
beat a small number of people
(see the front page photograph of
last Thursday's Daily), and then
continue pursuing the mass of
frightened protestors. Through

their continuous, well-organized
movements, the police easily
suceed in keeping demonstrators
nervous, fearful, and in disarray.
No Punishment
The police seldom have serious
difficulty shattering any
demonstration, no matter how
peaceful it may be, for they are
ever raising the level of threatened
injury to protesters. The police
have little to fear, the protesters
consoling everything.
Just as the police riot at the
Chicago Convention and the
murders at People's Park, Jackson
State, and Kent State all passed
without a single guilty policeman
or National Guardsman being
jailed, so do the routine police
beatings of demonstrators today
elicit only passing mention in
press coverage.
The substantial escalation in
the intensity and extent of the
police and military response to
protest has been paralleled by the
escalated rhetoric of "liberal"
politicians, on and off campus.
The most recent rationalizations
were provided by Mayor Joseph
Alioto last Tuesday. "Our
definition of violence includes the
physical obstruction of any street,
sidewalk, or public entrance to a
building."
And our own Richard Lyman
recently declared sit-ins an
"unacceptable" form of protest
that cannot be tolerated. (Why
the Nobel Prize Committee should
have awarded Rev. Martin Luther
King, master of such civil
disobedience tactics as the sit-in,
its Peace Prize will apparently be
forever shrouded in mystery.)
Small wonder that such monthly
redefinitions of the word

direct the activities of a large
number of local groups toward a
coordinated disruption of
"business as usual" in the Capitol.
However, 12,000 arrests later, it is
clear that something went wrong.
Active Opposition?
What went wrong in
Washington and in San Francisco
may be partially visible, in
microcosm at Stanford. Active
opposition to the Vietnam War on
this campus can generally be said
to fall under two headings:
disorganized or nonexistent. That
so many supposedly "educated"
people at this University can still
casually ignore the American-led
and financed slaughter of millions
of Asian peasants is, perhaps, a
matter best left to psychologists
and priests.
Some, enthralled by the
wonders of communes, sensitivity
sessions, and all the equipment of
the New Life Style child, are
simply too busy concoling one
another over the spiritual-in
tellectual anguish of the
middle-class student to be
bothered with uncouth "politics."
Planetary significance is to be
found in dope and ink drawings.
Others have no excuses at all.
Those who have engaged in
various forms of active radical
protest have, despite the
importance of such protest, been
unable or unwilling to combine
into the cohesive, permanent units
required by the administration's
increasingly aggressive actions
against demonstrators. Indeed, at
a time when discontent over
domestic and foreign policy has
almost never been so widespread,
radical groups remain just that -
"groups" of individuals without
real coherence or discipline and
thus largely unable to decide and
act effectively upon carefully
considered plans for anti-war
activity.
Organization Failure
There have seldom if ever been
attempts at Stanford (with the
possible exception of
Venceremos) to form anything
more stable than loose ad hoc
committees or even looser
discussion projects in which the
campus' many unaffiliated leftists
come temporarily together in

Grove lounge to discuss why it is
that they have come together.
It should be painfully clear to
all of us by now that rugged
individualism of the radical
variety, just as much as fervent
devotion to non-programs for
magically altered consciousness a
la Charles Reich, will only serve to
preserve the disorganized nature
of protest actions (to which police
tac squads owe much of their
deadly effectiveness) and to deter
more people away from active
opposition to the war in
Southeast Asia.
It is time, then, that we begin
seriously considering and acting
upon a few, basic issues: 1. While
the majority of radicals still cling
mainly to earlier forms of protest,
military, government, corporate,
and academic institutions have
coordinated their own forces to
an unprecedented degree in
increasingly powerful and
injurious acts against
demonstrators. The extent of
disorganization on the Left is so
severe that there has been almost
no attempt to imitate, much less
to refine, some of the more
successful tactics long-employed
by radicals in Paris and Berlin.
The building of elaborate street
barricades to allow people some
room in which to maneuver away
from rampaging police, and the
reliance (though only on a small
scale) on trained units, each
numbering 10 to 20 male and
female members, to rescue
individual protesters attacked by
police provide, at the very least, a
small measure of the
organizational security so
necessary for the physical safety
of demonstrates, and so lacking
in America. If large-scale
disruptive tactics are to be a viable
form of protest at this time, we
must have more in our arsenal
than spontaneous enthusiasm.
2. The attempts to counter
anti-radical actions by means of a
political organization, internally
cohesive and with a sizeable,
broadly representative
membership, have thus far met
with considerable opposition, not
only from liberals, but from a few
sources on the Left as well.
There sometimes appears to be
a peculiar fascination, often
evident within and between
anti-war groups at Stanford, with
the sort of senseless personal
criticisms which Mao Tse-Tung
denounced, in his Military
Writing, ("On Correcting Mistaken
Ideas in the Party") as "a
manifestation of petty-bourgeois
individualism." American radicals,
a good deal less organized than
the Red Army, can scarcely afford
more internal divisiveness.
Vanguardism
Also, there has for some time
been a handful of groups suffering
from premature exclusivity, in
that their desire to be labeled the
premier vanguard party has often
clouded the urgent need to
attract, through continual
education and organization, the
large numbers of people who
alone can provide a base for the
mass protest action of which
scattered, closed "affinity groups"
are incapable. It is encouraging
that this fact has now been
recognized even by Weatherman,
in the recent communique "New
Morning — Changing Weather"
(see David Horowitz's discussion
in the March, 1971, Ramparts).
3. Finally, it is one of the
outstanding advantages of
genuinely radical analyses that
they realize the interconnected
ness of American counter-insur
gency (not only in Vietnam, of
course, but throughout the world)
and the basic interests of the U.S.
power structure. Many liberals,
unwilling to recognize the past
decades of U.S. —supported
counter-revolutionary activities as
something more than unfortunate
"accidents" of otherwise
honorable and selfless government
and corporate policy-makers, may
be quite content with temporary
and loosely-organized "dovish"
reform groups.
Radicals, however, cannot. If
nothing else, I have tried to
suggest here, however sketchily,
that mass protest actions of the
type planned for Washington, San
Francisco, and several other cities
last week inevitably suffered from
the predominantly unorganized
and unprepared nature of the
scores of local groups which
composed them.
Radicalism, by the very depth
and scope of its analysis and its
hopes for a just social order,
demands the kind of long-term
organization which those of us at
Stanford have not as yet
established. We had best begin to
do so quickly.
(This article initially arose out
of conversations between Greg
DeFreitas and I)ru Cornell, both
of whom are radical students
here.)
