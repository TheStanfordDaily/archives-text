Today In The 'Daily'
Twenty-eight years and twelve days ago today, Dean John
Bunn announced that the "Army Will Take Toy on By
Monday." The U.S. Army. Our Army.
Bunn said that there were over 800 soldiers on campus with
more pouring in every day. Toyon was the third dormitory to
be taken over by the Army, after Sequoia and Branner. The
displaced students were moved to Encina, fraternities, or their
own devices. Pacified.
"Dean Bunn stated that the annual Toyon Spring Formal
will go on as scheduled, even if the soldiers were running around
the halls." Bight on, Bunn!
The Toyon Spring Formal will be postponed indefinitely this j
year, pending the Second Coming of the Mystery Tapestry.
