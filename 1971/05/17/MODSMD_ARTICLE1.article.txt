# Tom Hayden Arrested
## Police Scatter Park Crowd 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
The fence was ripped, but still
standing following clashes between
police and demonstrators on the second
anniversary of People's Park in
Berkeley Saturday.
Police split the crowd of 1,000
people on Telegraph Ave. using tear
gas, peper fog, and the shooting of
putty pellets to prevent the "retaking"
of the Park.
Forth one people were arrested and
at least eight injuries to demonstrators
and police resulted. One of those
arrested, Tom Hayden, a founder of
SDS, was booked for participating in
the riot. Other people were arrested on
malicious mischief, interfering with an
officer and assulting an officer.
Demonstrators tossed rocks, bottles,
cans, shoes and erected street
barricades, aflaming wooden one
guarded the entrance to Sproul Plaza
for a time.
Only one store was trashed. Missies
thrown by demonstrators sometimes
missed the 100 Berkeley and Alameda
County police and struck buildings and
demonstrators. Concrete planters were
rolled in the streets to prevent traffic

flow, especially the police pepper fog
car.
Impetus for the rally was provided
by the Daily Cal which urged that the
Park be "rededicated" in last Tuesday's
front page editorial.
It said, "We don't intend to provoke
any violence because we think it
doesn't take any violence to pull down
a fence."
The editorial, decided in a 3-2 split
by the editorial board, caused
dissension among the lower staffers and
two editorials Thursday.
'Daily Cal' Leaflet
Friday afternoon, the paper
circulated a leaflet which stated, "A
violent confrontation will not return
the park to the people. It will only lead
to the kind of senseless tragedy we saw
two years ago."
Following Saturday's violence, the
Daily Cal felt "the violence and
confrontations which occured today
were a dis-service to the spirit which
originally created the park. All
concerned citizens must now make
certain that acts such as occured today
do not reoccur."
In days of rioting in 1969, one
person was shot to death, one blinded,
and nearly 1,000 arrested after the
university, which owned the property
and didn't use it, erected a chain-link
fence and evicted students and street
people hwo had created a community
recreational facility.
The Park, now a parking lot and
field, has been successfully boycotted
for two years. The university failed to
even schedule intramural leagues there
as players held games miles away rather
than use the Park.
The fence, torn in an early
confrontation, was repaired while street
battles raged on Telegraph Ave. The
majority of the action took place away
from the Park.
The afternoon began with a rally
across from the Park on Haste St.
Speakers debated holding a picnic in
the Park, forcibly retaking it, or leaving
to build for a May 30 takeover.
The demonstrators rejected the
celebration in the Park as it "would be
dancing on the grave of James Rector"
(person shot to death in 1969). They
decided to march around the fence in
protest against it.

The march stopped as people tore
sections of the fence down and chanted
"We Want Our Park." When one person
was arrested for trying to cut the fence,
people attempted to surround the
police car and prevent it from leaving.
The car gunned its way through and the
demonstrators spilled into Haste St.
and the parking lot across from the
Park.
People trashed an unmarked police
car parked there and threw a few
bottles at police standing guard at the
Park. Police cleared the lot by firing the
putty pellets and tear gas canisters.
Demonstrators fled in panic when the
rifleman first fired, many assuming
bullets were to be shot.
Berkeley police reinforcements were
called in to protect the car and aid in
tiie dispersal of the crowd, following an
illegal assembly declaration at 2* 14
p.m.
Police continuously used the pellets
and tear gas to break up any crowd
which formed. Police on rooftops
occasionally threatened the crowd by
waving rifles which had no putty
pellets.
At 3:50, a police car spraying
pepper fog out its exhaust toured the
area. This left groups of people widely
separated and prevented any future
mass action.
Alameda County Sheriff deputies
were arrived an hour later and secured
intersections, at Berkeley police did
most of the crowd dispersal.
By 6:00 p.m., traffic had begun
flowing again on Telegraph Ave. A
police car, taking a corner sharply had
banged into a parked car and a crowd
gathered. After 15 minutes, a person
yelled, "Well, time to get back to the
riot."

Park Quiet

The Park remained quiet as at most
10 people were in it. Campus police
refused entry to people carrying garden
tools, although gates to the Park
remained open. The ebb and flow of
the demonstrators confined itself on
Telegraph Ave. Stores along the Avenue
closed for the afternoon, few of which
provided havens for demonstrators
during police sweeps.
