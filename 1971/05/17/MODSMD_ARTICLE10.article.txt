# Lyman Predicts Longer Education

"The tendency to regard a
college education as everyone's
birthright will grow inexorably"
in the future, prompting "marked
increases in the numbers of people
dropping in and out and back into
institutions of higher learning,"
according to President Richard
Lyman.
Addressing the Association of
Research Libraries on May 24,
Lyman also predicted growth of
the "educational stretch-out,
whereby even the Ph.D. does not
constitute the end of the line.
He added that, "the loosening
of the bonds once provided by
curriculum requirements, and by
compulsory reading assignments
will doubtless continue."
"However, I doubt if most
students really want to be quite as
free from requirements, and
therefore guidance, as their
rhetoric would cause one to
imagine—or as the ablest and most
independent-minded of them in

fact are."
Commenting on "the personal
and institutional conditions of
life, as they are likely to affect
research libraries," Lyman noted,
"We have already seen instances
of brutal disregard for the fragility
of a great library and for the
rights of other users."
Lyman called arson, theft and
careless or outright destructive
misuse "merely one more
expression of that pervasive
disrespect for cultural heritage
and for the authority of
established institutions,, that
affects rich and poor alike."
Citing the difficulty of devising
effective regulations, and the
impracticality of "differentiating
among users according to need,"
he contended that "equal
treatment generally takes the
form of equal immunity for all,
rather than equal subjection to
rational regulation for all.
"It is probably no accident

that some of the most egregious
faculty scoff-laws—the ones who
take out hundreds of books and
return them never, counting on
immunity from fines to shield
them—are to be found amongst
the ranks of the faculty
sympathizers with the newest
New Left," he added.

Eight law students and two
other graduate students were
placed on six months' probation
Friday, May 14, in San Jose
Municipal Court for blocking the
San Jose draft board three weeks
ago.
A condition of the probation
was that they not trespass for
political reasons.
The sentence followed their
conviction Wednesday on a
trespassing charge.
