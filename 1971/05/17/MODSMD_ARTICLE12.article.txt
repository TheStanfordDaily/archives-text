# Movie To Glorify Protein Synthesis
## 
### JOANNE JACOBS 
"Our objective is to bring
together two basic life
forms—human expression and
biochemistry."
Greg O'Leary and 15-20 fellow
freaks hope to lure at least 200
people to the lawn next to Hulme
in Escondido Village on Sunday.

May 23 to film "a choreography
of protein synthesis."
Individuals will represent
amino acids, KNA, nucleotides,
and auxiliary molecular
structures, while 50-80 people
make up a ribosome. However, no
knowledge of biology is necessary
to participate the sponsors

emphasize, since the operation has
been elaborately planned.
"Each individual will be
allowed to interpret his role in the
reaction and dance it out
accordingly-within the structure
of the model, of course," O'Leary
says.
One camera on top of an
over-looking eight-story building
will film the chemical goings-on,
while a camera on the ground will
record the actors' expressions.
Nucleotides will be color-coded
for identification and amino acids
will sport body paint. The
members of the ribosome will be
clad in hospital scrub suits to
perform as an amorphous mass.
The film will deal with a
dynamic process, as messenger
RNA moves through the ribosome
and transfer RNA picks up free
amino acids and shuttles them to
the mRNA at the ribosome, site
of protein synthesis.
In the cellular process, the
order of four nucleotide
bases—adenine, thymine, guanine
and cytosine—codes for a specific
protein. However, thousands of
actors would be needed to code
for an entire protein chain, so the
actors will not produce a real
protein.
Many of the film's sponsors are
medical students, but modern
dance people, a local carpenter,
and a UC San Diego film group
are also involved. The project is
financed by a grant (of the UCSD
group) and a gift from an
enthused doctor.
"The event will combine
esthetic and educational aspects,"
according to O'Leary, who is a
graduate student in English. "We

are doing this for the pleasure of
the experience and consider the
film primarily as a work of art
that portrays a beautiful process,
both human and biochemical." He
expects the filming to be fun for
the participants, even if they learn
nothing from it.
Although the group hopes to
market the film to biology
departments, the commercial
aspects are secondary. If they do
make money from the venture,
they may produce a more
ambitious project. DNA
replication? Meiosis? Sexual
reproduction?
"As far as we know, nothing
like this has been done before,"
O'Leary states. "This amounts to
a molecular happening on an epic
scale."
People with molecular acting
ambitions should appear at the
Hulme lawn in Escondido Village
at 11 a.m. this Sunday. The event
should last a few hours, but
nobody knows for sure how long
it will take. Nothing like this has
been done before.

"As far as we know, nothing
like this has been done before,"
O'Leary states. "This amounts to
a molecular happening on an epic
scale."
People with molecular acting
ambitions should appear at the
Hulme lawn in Escondido Village
at 11 a.m. this Sunday. The event
should last a few hours, but
nobody knows for sure how long
it will take. Nothing like this has
been done before.

PEEK-A-BOO—Steven Weber, Miranda Barry and Jeffrey Schmidt
play the sinister children in Gertrude Stein's "In A Garden, part of
the Drama Department production, "Limited Engagements,' opening
this week.

"Our objective is to bring
together two basic life
forms—human expression and
biochemistry."
Greg O'Leary and 15-20 fellow
freaks hope to lure at least 200
people to the lawn next to Hulme
in Escondido Village on Sunday.

May 23 to film "a choreography
of protein synthesis."
Individuals will represent
amino acids, KNA, nucleotides,
and auxiliary molecular
structures, while 50-80 people
make up a ribosome. However, no
knowledge of biology is necessary
to participate the sponsors

emphasize, since the operation has
been elaborately planned.
"Each individual will be
allowed to interpret his role in the
reaction and dance it out
accordingly-within the structure
of the model, of course," O'Leary
says.
One camera on top of an
over-looking eight-story building
will film the chemical goings-on,
while a camera on the ground will
record the actors' expressions.
Nucleotides will be color-coded
for identification and amino acids
will sport body paint. The
members of the ribosome will be
clad in hospital scrub suits to
perform as an amorphous mass.
The film will deal with a
dynamic process, as messenger
RNA moves through the ribosome
and transfer RNA picks up free
amino acids and shuttles them to
the mRNA at the ribosome, site
of protein synthesis.
In the cellular process, the
order of four nucleotide
bases—adenine, thymine, guanine
and cytosine—codes for a specific
protein. However, thousands of
actors would be needed to code
for an entire protein chain, so the
actors will not produce a real
protein.
Many of the film's sponsors are
medical students, but modern
dance people, a local carpenter,
and a UC San Diego film group
are also involved. The project is
financed by a grant (of the UCSD
group) and a gift from an
enthused doctor.
"The event will combine
esthetic and educational aspects,"
according to O'Leary, who is a
graduate student in English. "We

are doing this for the pleasure of
the experience and consider the
film primarily as a work of art
that portrays a beautiful process,
both human and biochemical." He
expects the filming to be fun for
the participants, even if they learn
nothing from it.
Although the group hopes to
market the film to biology
departments, the commercial
aspects are secondary. If they do
make money from the venture,
they may produce a more
ambitious project. DNA
replication? Meiosis? Sexual
reproduction?
