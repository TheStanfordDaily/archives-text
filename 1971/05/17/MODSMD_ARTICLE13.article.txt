# Students Publish Review
## 
### KELLY SMITH 
Student initiative in education
is a notion that has catalyzed a
number of projects designed and
coordinated by students here. One
such project has evolved into the
"Stanford Quarterly Review," a
new publication devoted to
undergraduate research.
"Outstanding research papers
usually are read only by the
author and one faculty member,"
says Brooke Shearer,
editor-in-chief. "The Review, we
hope, will serve as an incentive for
undergraduates to prepare and
publish essays of outstanding
merit.
The Review, which comes out
today, contains four articles

chosen from an original group of
40.
"We solicited all academic
departments for research-oriented
papers, rather than creative
writing," explains Shearer.
"Professors sent them in, and
students came in on their own
when they heard about us."
Once submitted, the papers are
read three or four times by an
editorial board before final
selections are made. To be
accepted, the essays must
demonstrate competent
scholarship as well as readability.
The four papers featured in
this quarter's Review are
"Progress and Population: The
Problem of Communist China,"

by Jamie Horsley, "Nathaniel
West's A Cool Million," by
Elizabeth Smith, "The Problems
of Translating Shakespeare into
German," by Chandler Stolp, and
"Why McLean Lost: An Analysis
of Survey Data," by Larry
Diamond.
Students working with Shearer
are Kathy Foote, Pamela Heggen,
Andres Walkover, associate
editors; Bay Manning, art director;
John Page, business manager; and
Dennis Shaver, circulation
manager.
The faculty review board
includes Profs. David Levin,
English; Robert Packenham,
Political Science; Peter Raven,
Biology; John Manning,
Engineering; and James Gibbs,
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
Dean Gibbs mentioned the
possibility of such a publication
last fall while talking to alumni,
and Shearer, who was on the
panel with him, followed up on
the idea. John Grube, assistant to
the Dean of Students, offered the
assistance of his Student Services
Task Force, and the project was
under way.
Copies of the "Stanford
Quarterly Review" are now
available at the Review desk on
White Plaza or through the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies office.
A single issue is $1; subscriptions
are $3.75.
