# Indians Seek PAC-8 Titles
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
The time has come for all good
Stanford teams to prove their
worth in the Pacific-8
Championships to be held this
week for baseball, golf, track, and
tennis.
By virtue of the baseball team's
last minute qualification for the
post-season tournament, the
Indians will be represented in
every major sport in the
conference playoffs which are
stepping stones for national
competition and rankings.
UCLA's twins losses to the
unbeaten Trojans, coupled with
the Cards' sweep of a weekend
series with Cal thrust Stanford
into the playoffs. Although the
Bruins ended the regular season
action with a 9-6 record identical
to the Indians', two losses in their

three game series with Coach Ray
Young's men eliminated them
from the tournament.
Action begins on Thursday at
Washington State and Stanford's
first opponent will be the host
squad. The tournament is a
double elimination affair and the
favorite has to be the powerful
USC team. The Trojans will play
northern runnerup Oregon in the
opening round.
The Cougars have lost two of
their three game series with the
Cards, winning only the first game
of a doubleheader at the Sunken
Diamond on May 1,5-3. Stanford
came back to crush WSU in the
nightcap by the score of 11 -1. The
host squad for the tournament
compiled a weak 7-8 record in
Pac-8 play and Oregon (7 -9) did
not do much better. The stronger

Southern Division teams should
eliminate their Northern rivals and
meet in the finals.
Golfers on Spot
The Indian golfers begin Pac-8
Championship play today at
Eugene in an attempt to defend
their conference title. Coach Bud
Finger's men handed a poor
UCLA squad its only victory of
the season last Saturday on the
Stanford Golf Course and must
shoot much better golf to turn
back the expected challenge of
the Trojans in the 72 hole event.
Tom Watson and John Beers
have been shooting very well the
past few weeks and they will be
joined in the Pac-8 meet by Pete
Harpster and Gary Vanier. This
strong nucleus of players has
performed well in big

tournaments this year and should
be the favorite to take this
season's Pac-8 crown.
The track team will send its
best performers to the Pac-8
Championship to be held this
Friday and Saturday at Seattle,
the home of the Huskies.
Although the squad won only one
conference meet, it has a strong
group of individuals who could
challenge for a high place in the
NCAA Championships.
Led by Randy White, Rick
Tipton, Don Kardong, Casey
Carrigan, Allen Meridith, Tom
Anderson, and Steve Davis,
Stanford will make a strong
showing.
Tennis Hopes
Coach Dick Gould's netmen
will vie for the conference crown
this Thursday through Saturday at
Oregon State. UCLA, top ranked
nationally, has to be favored to
win the championship. Stanford
will be the only squad to give the
Bruins a problem in the
tournament. The Indians should
outpoint Cal and USC for second
place but it is unlikely that
anyone will be able to deprive
UCLA of the Championship.
The Bruins will be led by Jeff
Borowiak from Berkeley.
Borowiak has defeated the Cards'
Roscoe Tanner twice already this
season in the two matches.
Number two man for UCLA is
Haroon Rahim, Pakistani Davis
cupper. Rahim is a strong player
and could go far in the
tournament. The number three
man for the Bruins will be
National Junior Champion Jimmy
Connors.
