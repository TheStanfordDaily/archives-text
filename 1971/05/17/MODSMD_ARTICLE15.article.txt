# Cards Nip Cal Twice, Cinch PAC-8 Playoff
## 
### 
every necessary condition
fell into place, Stanford's baseball
team battled its way into the
playoffs. While UCLA was losing
to USC 1-0 and 6-3, the Indians
fulfilled their half of the bargain
by coming back in the ninth
inning of each game to win two
from Cal, 4-3 and 2-1, on Friday
and Saturday.
The double win by Stanford
and the two narrow losses by
UCLA gave each team an 11-6
record, but Stanford got the
playoff bid by virtue of its 2-1
edge in the season series with the
Bruins. USC topped the southern
division with a perfect 17-0
record.
Stanford now advances to the
first round of the playoffs, being
held at the University of Oregon,
where the Indians will face
Washington State on Thursday.
Oregon, the second place team in
the north, will take on the
formidable Trojans.
Rod Boone was the hero of
Friday's game in Berkeley,

powering a home run in the ninth
inning which gave the Indians the
4-3 victory. On Saturday, after
Cal had tied the game in the top
of the ninth, three straight
Stanford hits provided Bob
Kammeyer with a well-earned 2-1
win.


STANFORD RECORD HOLDER Terri Allen, shown here in the
butterly, set a Stanford record of 27.6 for the 50 yard free style in the
Women's Invitational meet Saturday. Stanford placed fourth in the
meet.
