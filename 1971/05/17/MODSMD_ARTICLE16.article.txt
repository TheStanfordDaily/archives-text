# Ralston Drills Ends
## 
### 
The twentieth and final spring
football practice ended Saturday
with the annual Red and White
scrimmage, won by the Reds,
24-13. Performing as though he
had no intention of becoming a
third stringer, 6'3", 195 lb. Mike
Boryla assumed the starring role
in his quarterback position,
completing 17 of his 22 passes for
230 yards and two touchdowns.
Boryla established a good deal
order in a game that was
otherwise very sloppy in many
spots. Twenty-six seniors had
been given the week off by coach
John Ralston who felt that they
had worked enough during the
season and for the Rose Bowl.
Boryla's competitor Jess
Freitas, didn't enjoy quite as
outstanding a day as the Denver
native. Freitas hit only 11 of his
twenty passes for 108 yards and
one interception.
Tight end Bill Scott was the
best receiver of the day as he
solidified his hold on Bob Moore's
spot. Scott hauled in seven passes
for a total of 73 yards.
John Winesberry, a freshman
who should see plenty of
action next year at running back or
the wide receiver slot, played with
a bruised thigh, but still stood out
as one of the day's best
performers. The 6'l", 190 lb.
native of Tulsa caught four passes
for 69 yards and carried the ball

14 times, gaining 71 yards.
Gordon Riegel made the
biggest hit on defense and should
probably fill Ron Kadziel's
outside linebacker spot next fall.
Riegel showed a lot of power as
his 220 lb. frame would seem to
indicate and made consecutive
tackles on numerous occasions.
