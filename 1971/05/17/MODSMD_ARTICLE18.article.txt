# Final Match Before PAC-B's
## Netmen Whip Berkeley, 6-3 
### 
The Stanford tennis team
defeated Cal, 6-3 in their final
natch before the Pac-S
championships next week at
Oregon State.
In the singles only Roscoe
Tanner at number one and Stan
Pasarell at number four won
without difficulty. Tanner,
volleying easily, disposed of Bob
Alloo, 6-3, 6-4. Roscoe broke his
opponent the first time he served
in both sets. Pasarell defeated the
Bear's Mike Mullin, 6 -2, 7 -5.
Number two man for the
Cards, Sandy Mayer, ousted Steve
Stefanki, 7-6, 6-4, in a grueling
match. Gery Grosilmond at
number six, lost the first set, 7-€,
and trailed in the second 3-2.
However, his return of serve got

better and he broke his
opponent's serve in the next
game. This provided him with
enough impetus to win the next
three games. Grosilmond took the
third set, 6-4. His volleying was
accurate and consistent
throughout the match.
Sophomore Rick Fisher at
number three was off his game
and lost to Larry Parker in
straight sets. Fisher lacked finesse
and couldn't put his shots away.
His opponent played well, angling
his shots all over the court. At
number six Freshman Paul Sidone
lost a marathon three-set duel to
Peter Campbell. Sidone, like
Fisher, couldn't seem to put away
any of his shots and lacked
consistency with his serve.

In the doubles Tanner and
Mayer started slowly and weren't
quite as quick as their opponents.
They lost the first set, 7 -5.
However, they reverted to a
defensive style of playing back
and lobbing, only occasionally
rushing the net. The strategy
worked and Tanner and Mayer
cruised the rest of the way,
winning 5-7,6-1,6-2.
The third doubles combo of
juniors MacClaflin and Rick Evans
also took a while to get warmed
up, but won 4-6, 7-6, 6-4. The
Card tandem gained momentum
as their return of serves were more
accurate and outplayed their
opponents the last two sets.
