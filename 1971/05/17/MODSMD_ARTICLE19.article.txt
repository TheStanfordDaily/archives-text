# Student Arrested In Campus Bust
## 
### 
A Stanford student and three
teenagers were arrested for possession
and sale of marijuana last Thursday
night on the University campus. These
may be the first drug arrests at
Stanford in two years.
The four defendants were arrested
by two Palo Alto policemen. They,
apparently, had been tipped off by an
undercover agent, whom police will not
identify, who had been following one
of the teenagers.
The student has been identified as
John F. Eiseman, 21.
The transaction that was to be made
involved one kilo of marijuana,
apparently priced at $200. Other
material which is believed to be
'restricted dangerous drugs' was also
seized. However, police are waiting for
the results of a lab report analyzing
their content.
Three of the four suspects were
charged with felonies; they were
booked into North Santa Clara County
Jail and released on bail. The fourth, a

juvenile, was booked into Santa Clara
County Juvenile Hall.
One of the arrested teenagers is the
son of former Palo Alto Police Chief
William Hydie.
The police did not have a warrant
for the arrest of any of the suspects.
They said the arrest was made because
there was "probable cause" that a
criminal situation existed.
The transaction was to have been

completed at the Stanford Shopping
Center, but the site was shifted to ZAP
House, a coed living group, where the
arrests were made.
The University administration was
never informed of the situation prior to
the arrests; Robert Rosenzweig,
Associate Provost, and John Schwartz,
Assistant to the President, said last
night that they were surprised that a
bust had even taken place at Stanford.
