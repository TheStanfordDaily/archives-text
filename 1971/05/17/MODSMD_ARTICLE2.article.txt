# Minority Law Admissions Revised
## 
### ROBIN STICKNEY 
Law School admission policies were
amended last week to grant admission
"substantially automatically" to
minority applicants whose Law Board
scores are somewhat below those of
present non-minority students. The
new guidelines provide for the
admission of 11 minority students in
addition to 29 admitted under the
normal academic criteria.
"Under the assumption that we
receive the normal percentage of
acceptances from these 40 students,
there will be 10 to 13 minority
students in the incoming class,"
commented Francisco Barba, a first
year law student. "10 to 13 students is
not a substantial number of minority
students for next semester.
"At this stage of the game, this late,
it will be hard to cash in on the
increased number of acceptances," he
continued. "We are competing against
other schools which have more money
and better programs. Our goal is to turn
as many applications into actual
acceptances as possible."
The decision to revise admissions
criteria has come in the wake of

criticism by students and a major
revision of the minority program at the
law school. Bayless Manning, Dean of
the Law School, recently announced
the suspension of the Legal Educational
Opportunity Program, a four year
program aimed at minority students
with "outstanding promise" but
inadequate preparation for Stanford.
Students now participating in the
program are to be phased into the
regular curriculum on an individual
basis. "The program has not gone well
and probably its basic premise is
wrong," said Dean Manning.
Minority students involved in the
program agree that it has been a failure,
but are cautious about applauding the
decision to discontinue the program
without workable alternatives. "Our
goal is to get a minimum working
number of minority students," stated
Barba. "There are a number of possible
qualifications for law students."
Minority students asked the
Administration to consider applicants
with Board scores up to 100 points
below the lowest LSAT and LQI scores
for a regular non-minority student in
the 1970 entering class. "We believe

this middle group could do the work
here on a completely competitive basis
with non-minority students,"
emphasized Victor Vilaplana, a first
year student who is Chairman of the
Chicano Law Students Association.
The new administrative guidelines
have set the limit not more than 50
points below the lowest scores of 1970
admissions. Dean Manning believes that
such criteria "should never be
inflexibly mechanical . . . the hands of
the [admissions officers] are not rigidly
tied."
"We want students v : no can do the
work, and a certain admissions standard
is necessary to achieve that goal,"
stated Thelton Henderson, Assistant
Dean. "The median LSAT score is 688
and the median GPA is 3.4 for Stanford
Law students. If grades mean anything,
students admitted at substantially
lower levels are a high risk."
Ralph Arreola, who has a Masters in
Engineering from Berkeley and who
was admitted to the four-year program
last year, feels that this is a particularly
paternalistic attitude. Most of the
students in the program have had
graduate training in some field other
than law.
Mel Kennedy, a first-year black
student, said it was ironic that the
Administration had frequently agreed
that undergraduate grades and LSAT
scores were not good indicators of
performance in law school, and yet
placed so much emphasis on LSAT and
grade point in admissions.
"We have tried to explain to them
how inconsistent their policies are, but
the Administration is not willing to do
what it takes to rectify the situation,"
claims Barba. "We have been treated as
if we were retarded."

One of the major criticisms of the
four-year program by minority students
was the feeling that they were seen as
potential failures. This became a
"self-fulfilling prophesy."
The LEOP four-year program had
students take first year Law School
courses over a two year period.
However, participants soon found that
they could not function as law
students.
Students forced to take only two
out of four courses found it difficult to
contribute to study groups and also to
learn without benefit of information on
the courses not taken. This created
psychological as well as academic
problems. "We felt like we had to
explain or ask for an excuse because of
our four-year status," they said.
"Non-minority students are actually
prevented from going on sabbatical
because the school feels that there is an
underlying continuity in the courses.
The structure of the four-year program
practically assured failure."
Another problem of the program
seemed to be the lack of
communication between students and
administrators, although one student
claims he spent an average of 15 hours
per week talking to the Administration
on "other than academic matters."
Students spoke of being "arbitrarily"
placed in classes and dropped from
others "without consultation or
explanations."
Though minority students seem
pleased with the decision to
discontinue the four-year program,
they agree that "there are many
problems outside the program which
the program has only highlighted.
These problems will have to be dealt
with in their own right."
