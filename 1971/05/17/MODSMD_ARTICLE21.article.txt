Sadat Freedom Plea
CAIRO — President Anwar Sadat appealed to Egyptian
police yesterday to help him build a "new state in which
every citizen can feel free and secure."
Speaking to a group of security police who visited him
at Kubbeh Republic Palace to express their support, Sadat
said: "With your help-men of the police we can safeguard
the unity of our nation. By keeping order at home, your
brothers at the front will no longer feel insecure."
He warned them it was no longer the police's job to
keep tabs on individual citizens because citizens will be able
to defend themselves and not be subject to blackmail.
The interior minister he ousted last Thursday, Sharawi
Gomaa, was accused of widescale wire tapping, including
Sadat's own office.

Rail Strike Called
WASHINGTON — The signalmen's union called a
nationwide rail strike from 6:01 a.m. this morning after
last-minute efforts by the Labor Department to bring about
an accord fell through.

Labor Secretary James D. Hodgson appeared at a 1:30
a.m. EDT news conference to make the announcement. He
said he was bitterly disappointed but that disagreement
over wages had proved an insurmountable hurdle.
LBJ Missed Peace Chance
NEW YORK — Former British Prime Minister Harold
Wilson is quoted as saying that former President Lyndon
Johnson missed a chance to end the Vietnam war in 1967
by withdrawing a truce proposal after it had been handed
to Soviet Premier Aleksei Kosygin for transmission to
Hanoi.
Wilson's version of the incident is carried in this week's
Life magazine in an excerpt from Wilson's forthcoming
memoirs.
