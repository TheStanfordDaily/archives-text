# Land Use Meeting
## 
### 
The third public hearing of the Quarter on the
Livingston and Blayney policy/plan for Stanford land
use will be held tonight by the University Committee
on Land and Building Development.
The session is set for 7:30 p.m. in Bishop
Auditorium in the Graduate School of Business.
Professor of Chemical Engineering David Mason,
chairman of the committee, said that groups which
prepared statements for an April hearing, but were
not heard at that time, would first present their views
Monday night. They will be followed by other groups
that have since submitted statements to the
Committee. Finally, comments from the floor will be
welcomed.
