# Black Plebiscite Seeks Support For Demands
## 
### KATHY EISSLER 
The Black Students Union plebiscite
of the Stanford community asks
support for the recently issued black
demands as first steps towards
eliminating racial inequities at
Stanford. Issues raised during the BSU
convocation last week were discussed
last Friday at 3 p.m. in Tresidder 282.
Their statement read in part, "we
are innocent of all charges, save that of
being opposed to racism!" Whereas all
individuals hold the right to love and
hate other individuals intrinsic, limited
only in that no other individual's need
be obtruded, be it resolved that no
institution further perpetrate these acts
deemed racism by the group action."
"Hopefully racism is based on
ignorance . . . The result of ignorance is
only greater polarization . . . (the
ignorance may) not necessarily be
factual, but would leave a basic part of
the Stanford community unknowing,"
according to Ron Bailey, graduate
student and member of the BSU. "The
only thing the BSU is interested in
provoking is greater sensitivity to the
uniqueness of Black problems in

America and getting some action to
them," Bailey stressed.
Raymond Bachetti, Associate
Provost, described three strategies of
attack for this problem: One
straight-out pressure, which has proved
successful only when it did not create
more problems than it solved—when it
pushed people over the threshhold of
the problem and induced positive
action.
Henry Organ, of the General
Secretary's Office, remarked that black
institutions did move forward
noticeably recently after recent
national tragedies, resulting in more
employment of blacks and greater
percentages of black enrollment at
universities, but he questioned whether
this could also have been due to guilt,
Bachetti's second strategy.
Bachetti's third strategy, that of
overcoming ignorance, is the basis for
the plebiscite. Sotere Torregian, writer
in residence for the Afro-American
program, declares "The problem of
class struggle in America is a matter of
life and death. When you receive that
plebiscite you've got to realize that the
people involved are going to jail."
