# Clebsch-Faculty Must Innovate
## 
### BOB BACON 
"In the last analysis, the University consists of
departments, and the way to reform the University is
to reform the departments and the faculty members."
That is the prescription for academic change
offered by William A. Clebsch, chairman of the
Department of Humanities Special Programs. He
holds possibly the best position on campus for
putting that plan into practice, for, as he puts it, "in
this department, innovation is the name of the
game."
Clebsch's department differs from others in that it
consists entirely of experimental and innovative
programs that have not yet attained, and may never
attain, departmental status.
Clebsch, a former chairman of the Academic
Senate, is outspoken in his belief that University
reform begins with the faculty. "The faculty must
provide the foresight, rigor, and permanence to make
genuine reform possible. Neither students nor
presidents are around long enough to achieve it; so
neither can do it without the faculty."
He continues, "I believe that many students look
to the faculty to lead the way to educational reform,
but too damn many faculty think of leadership as
following the students wherever they want to go. But
I'm with the students in looking to the faculty for
leadership."
An important reform, according to Clebsch, would
be faculty evaluation of each other's teaching. "In no
other profession is there more isolation between
colleagues. The faculty don't look over one another's
shoulders. We need fraternal correction in this
profession more than in any other," he insists.
Evaluation of Teaching
Clebsch sees the value of student evaluation of
teaching used in conjunction with faculty
self-evaluation, but warns that "it's long-range trends
in student evaluation date that count. The evaluations
shouldn't be used to pander to students' momentary
pleasures, but rather to build educational techniques
and aims."

"Long-range improvement of and by faculties will
command new respect for academia if anything will,"
he asserts.
Clebsch has been a member of the Faculty Senate
since its inception three years ago, and served for two
years as director of the Freshman Seminar Program.
He says that he takes part in such activities "not
trying to get more say in university administration for
the faculty, but trying to turn the faculty toward
transformation and renewal of education."
Colleagues in the Senate describe Clebsch as "very
hard-working; decisive and firm but also scrupulously
fair and kindly." They paint a picture of a man who
combines shrewdness and hard work to produce
effectiveness. One pointed out that "Bill is very
powerful in the Senate. His voice carries lots of votes;
people listen to him."
A trained historian, the 47-year-old professor
holds a joint appointment in two of the programs in
his department, religion and humanities. He
specializes academically in the history of Christianity
in England and America. By birth a Tennessean, he
holds an undergraduate degree from University of
Tennessee and advanced degrees from Union
Theological Seminary.
Clebsch will be on leave next year, researching a
history of religious thought in America under a grant
from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
He plans to publish a book dealing with his
conviction that leading religious thinkers both
reflected and shaped the American scene. He is the
author of five books.
Highly Knowledgeable
Students report that Clebsch is highly
knowledgeable, with a brilliant mind and an uncanny
acquaintance with the literature and ideas of his field.
He is described as "very proper; cordial but a bit
aloof" in his dealings with students. He is thorough
and rigorous in his academic work; and the program
which he directs mirrors this, but he is not afraid to

enliven his classes with his sense of humor or his
talent for overdramatic reading.
A member of his department stated that Clebsch
"has been known to boggle the minds of students by
his encyclopedic knowledge of revival hymns and his
willingness to sing them."
Clebsch, crew-cut and bow-tied, perenially
smoking a pipe, speaks slowly and deliberately with a
trace of a southern accent. His quiet manner of
speech belies his outspokenness on matters that
concern him — academic and otherwise. Expounding
in his combination office and seminar room on the
Inner Quad, he points out that his principal interest is
in academic reform, but also expresses his feelings
about social activism by clergymen:
"I wonder if the clergy- don't more effectively
mold the attitudes of their followers by subtle and
rather silent means than by noisy news worthiness. Of
course, most do.
"Most clergy do their jobs well, but they're the
unsung ones. One of the problems with American
religion today is that it's the noisy priest who gets in
the news, but maybe it's the silent priest who really
changes minds and hearts.
"However, in their favor is the fact that the clergy
as a profession were very early alert to the moral as
well as material damage of the Vietnam War. They
saw the profundity of damage before the politicians
did.
"I entirely respect the right and duty of a
clergyman or anyone else to be a responsible citizen.
Hut it seems that the clergy as a group are more
tempted than others to be universal experts on a
thousand issues. I have an inherent mistrust of a
know-it-all. be he clergyman or otherwise."
Stanford's "most tenaciously self-reforming
department" has in William Clebsch a chairman who
is outspoken in his loyalty to the university and his
dedication to academic self-reform and who practices
what he preaches in the department and in the
university as a whole.

That is the prescription for academic change
offered by William A. Clebsch, chairman of the
Department of Humanities Special Programs. He
holds possibly the best position on campus for
putting that plan into practice, for, as he puts it, "in
this department, innovation is the name of the
game."
Clebsch's department differs from others in that it
consists entirely of experimental and innovative
programs that have not yet attained, and may never
attain, departmental status.
Clebsch, a former chairman of the Academic
Senate, is outspoken in his belief that University
reform begins with the faculty. "The faculty must
provide the foresight, rigor, and permanence to make
genuine reform possible. Neither students nor
presidents are around long enough to achieve it; so
neither can do it without the faculty."
He continues, "I believe that many students look
to the faculty to lead the way to educational reform,
but too damn many faculty think of leadership as
following the students wherever they want to go. But
I'm with the students in looking to the faculty for
leadership."
An important reform, according to Clebsch, would
be faculty evaluation of each other's teaching. "In no
other profession is there more isolation between
colleagues. The faculty don't look over one another's
shoulders. We need fraternal correction in this
profession more than in any other," he insists.
Evaluation of Teaching
Clebsch sees the value of student evaluation of
teaching used in conjunction with faculty
self-evaluation, but warns that "it's long-range trends
in student evaluation date that count. The evaluations
shouldn't be used to pander to students' momentary
pleasures, but rather to build educational techniques
and aims."

"Long-range improvement of and by faculties will
command new respect for academia if anything will,"
he asserts.
Clebsch has been a member of the Faculty Senate
since its inception three years ago, and served for two
years as director of the Freshman Seminar Program.
He says that he takes part in such activities "not
trying to get more say in university administration for
the faculty, but trying to turn the faculty toward
transformation and renewal of education."
Colleagues in the Senate describe Clebsch as "very
hard-working; decisive and firm but also scrupulously
fair and kindly." They paint a picture of a man who
combines shrewdness and hard work to produce
effectiveness. One pointed out that "Bill is very
powerful in the Senate. His voice carries lots of votes;
people listen to him."
A trained historian, the 47-year-old professor
holds a joint appointment in two of the programs in
his department, religion and humanities. He
specializes academically in the history of Christianity
in England and America. By birth a Tennessean, he
holds an undergraduate degree from University of
Tennessee and advanced degrees from Union
Theological Seminary.
Clebsch will be on leave next year, researching a
history of religious thought in America under a grant
from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
He plans to publish a book dealing with his
conviction that leading religious thinkers both
reflected and shaped the American scene. He is the
author of five books.
Highly Knowledgeable
Students report that Clebsch is highly
knowledgeable, with a brilliant mind and an uncanny
acquaintance with the literature and ideas of his field.
He is described as "very proper; cordial but a bit
aloof" in his dealings with students. He is thorough
and rigorous in his academic work; and the program
which he directs mirrors this, but he is not afraid to

enliven his classes with his sense of humor or his
talent for overdramatic reading.
A member of his department stated that Clebsch
"has been known to boggle the minds of students by
his encyclopedic knowledge of revival hymns and his
willingness to sing them."
Clebsch, crew-cut and bow-tied, perenially
smoking a pipe, speaks slowly and deliberately with a
trace of a southern accent. His quiet manner of
speech belies his outspokenness on matters that
concern him — academic and otherwise. Expounding
in his combination office and seminar room on the
Inner Quad, he points out that his principal interest is
in academic reform, but also expresses his feelings
about social activism by clergymen:
"I wonder if the clergy- don't more effectively
mold the attitudes of their followers by subtle and
rather silent means than by noisy news worthiness. Of
course, most do.
"Most clergy do their jobs well, but they're the
unsung ones. One of the problems with American
religion today is that it's the noisy priest who gets in
the news, but maybe it's the silent priest who really
changes minds and hearts.
"However, in their favor is the fact that the clergy
as a profession were very early alert to the moral as
well as material damage of the Vietnam War. They
saw the profundity of damage before the politicians
did.
"I entirely respect the right and duty of a
clergyman or anyone else to be a responsible citizen.
Hut it seems that the clergy as a group are more
tempted than others to be universal experts on a
thousand issues. I have an inherent mistrust of a
know-it-all. be he clergyman or otherwise."
Stanford's "most tenaciously self-reforming
department" has in William Clebsch a chairman who
is outspoken in his loyalty to the university and his
dedication to academic self-reform and who practices
what he preaches in the department and in the
university as a whole.

holds possibly the best position on campus for
putting that plan into practice, for, as he puts it, "in
this department, innovation is the name of the
game."
Clebsch's department differs from others in that it
consists entirely of experimental and innovative
programs that have not yet attained, and may never
attain, departmental status.
Clebsch, a former chairman of the Academic
Senate, is outspoken in his belief that University
reform begins with the faculty. "The faculty must
provide the foresight, rigor, and permanence to make
genuine reform possible. Neither students nor
presidents are around long enough to achieve it; so
neither can do it without the faculty."
He continues, "I believe that many students look
to the faculty to lead the way to educational reform,
but too damn many faculty think of leadership as
following the students wherever they want to go. But
I'm with the students in looking to the faculty for
leadership."
An important reform, according to Clebsch, would
be faculty evaluation of each other's teaching. "In no
other profession is there more isolation between
colleagues. The faculty don't look over one another's
shoulders. We need fraternal correction in this
profession more than in any other," he insists.
Evaluation of Teaching
Clebsch sees the value of student evaluation of
teaching used in conjunction with faculty
self-evaluation, but warns that "it's long-range trends
in student evaluation date that count. The evaluations
shouldn't be used to pander to students' momentary
pleasures, but rather to build educational techniques
and aims."

"Long-range improvement of and by faculties will
command new respect for academia if anything will,"
he asserts.
Clebsch has been a member of the Faculty Senate
since its inception three years ago, and served for two
years as director of the Freshman Seminar Program.
He says that he takes part in such activities "not
trying to get more say in university administration for
the faculty, but trying to turn the faculty toward
transformation and renewal of education."
Colleagues in the Senate describe Clebsch as "very
hard-working; decisive and firm but also scrupulously
fair and kindly." They paint a picture of a man who
combines shrewdness and hard work to produce
effectiveness. One pointed out that "Bill is very
powerful in the Senate. His voice carries lots of votes;
people listen to him."
A trained historian, the 47-year-old professor
holds a joint appointment in two of the programs in
his department, religion and humanities. He
specializes academically in the history of Christianity
in England and America. By birth a Tennessean, he
holds an undergraduate degree from University of
Tennessee and advanced degrees from Union
Theological Seminary.
Clebsch will be on leave next year, researching a
history of religious thought in America under a grant
from the National Endowment for the Humanities.
He plans to publish a book dealing with his
conviction that leading religious thinkers both
reflected and shaped the American scene. He is the
author of five books.
Highly Knowledgeable
Students report that Clebsch is highly
knowledgeable, with a brilliant mind and an uncanny
acquaintance with the literature and ideas of his field.
He is described as "very proper; cordial but a bit
aloof" in his dealings with students. He is thorough
and rigorous in his academic work; and the program
which he directs mirrors this, but he is not afraid to

enliven his classes with his sense of humor or his
talent for overdramatic reading.
A member of his department stated that Clebsch
"has been known to boggle the minds of students by
his encyclopedic knowledge of revival hymns and his
willingness to sing them."
Clebsch, crew-cut and bow-tied, perenially
smoking a pipe, speaks slowly and deliberately with a
trace of a southern accent. His quiet manner of
speech belies his outspokenness on matters that
concern him — academic and otherwise. Expounding
in his combination office and seminar room on the
Inner Quad, he points out that his principal interest is
in academic reform, but also expresses his feelings
about social activism by clergymen:
"I wonder if the clergy- don't more effectively
mold the attitudes of their followers by subtle and
rather silent means than by noisy news worthiness. Of
course, most do.
"Most clergy do their jobs well, but they're the
unsung ones. One of the problems with American
religion today is that it's the noisy priest who gets in
the news, but maybe it's the silent priest who really
changes minds and hearts.
"However, in their favor is the fact that the clergy
as a profession were very early alert to the moral as
well as material damage of the Vietnam War. They
saw the profundity of damage before the politicians
did.
"I entirely respect the right and duty of a
clergyman or anyone else to be a responsible citizen.
Hut it seems that the clergy as a group are more
tempted than others to be universal experts on a
thousand issues. I have an inherent mistrust of a
know-it-all. be he clergyman or otherwise."
Stanford's "most tenaciously self-reforming
department" has in William Clebsch a chairman who
is outspoken in his loyalty to the university and his
dedication to academic self-reform and who practices
what he preaches in the department and in the
university as a whole.
