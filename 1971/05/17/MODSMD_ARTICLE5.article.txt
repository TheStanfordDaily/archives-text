## Abolish Mail Monopoly 
### 
Postage rates went up yesterday. It now costs
eight cents to mail the same first-class letters that I
can remember taking three-cent, purple "Statue of
Liberty" stamps.
Yesterday's rate hike and the recent
organizational re-shuffling in the Post Office are no
deviation from the pattern which emerges from the
Post Office's sorry history.
It is a pattern of political censorship,
comstockery, mail covers, patronage pay-offs, and
inefficient management. The United States Post
Office was set up in 1789; it went $40 into the red
that year. Being a losing proposition is a
time-honored custom in the Post Office.
Censorship Connection
We are familiar with the fact that officers censor
the mail enlisted men send home in wartime and the
fact that mail sent to and by prisoners in jail is
censored. But there seems to be little recognition of
how closely these two cases resemble the situation
in which we all find ourselves. For every
governmental decision banning pornography from
the mails or forcing recipients to register with the
government their desire to receive Marxist literature
sent to them from foreign countries, there is some
parallel possible interdiction which describes and
proscribes what we ourselves receive or send
through the mail.
The New York Times of March 31, 1971, carries
a story which begins: "A confidential Army
directive obtained from Vietnam shows that Army
commanders have been ordered to intercept and
confiscate personal, first-class mail containing
anti-war or other dissident publications sent to
soldiers here."
History repeats itself. At the turn of the century,
when the United' States was putting down the
Filipino national liberation movement led by Emilio
Aguinaldo, Edward Atkinson, an American

hernando tristero

laissez-faire liberal, sent anti-imperialist material to
American soldiers in the Philippines.
On May 2, 1899, Postmaster-General Charles
Emory Smith ordered his postmaster in San
Francisco to remove Atkinson's pamphlets from the
Manila mails. The Springfield Republican found in
the seizure "the mailed hand of the rule of blood
and iron being gradually disclosed . . . which will
next fall heavily upon freedom of speech within the
old borders of the United States."
Civil War-era jurist Lysander Spooner spoke
directly to the problem we all face when he wrote:
"Any law which compels a man to pay a certain
sum of money to the government for the privilege
of speaking to a distant individual, or which debars
him of the right of employing such a mesenger as he
perfers to entrust with his communications,
'abridges' his 'freedom of speech.' "
Post Office Conscription
A new and innovative link in the chain of social
control and suppression of freedom of discourse has
been added in our own time. In Ohio, truants,
whose violation of compulsory attendance laws was
deserting the public high school to attend anti-war
rallies, have as punishment been conscripted into
working for the Post Office.
What began as conscription of the people's
resources to finance the government post office and
included efforts to conscript the mind by
controlling communications, has now been
recognized to have new potential. Perhaps the
prototype of national service (servitude) we see in
Governor Ronald Reagan's Ecology Corps camps
will be extended to conscripting youth into the
postal system.
For the sake of free speech and a free society, we
must abolish the postal monopoly. (Hernando

anti-war or other dissident publications sent to
soldiers here."
History repeats itself. At the turn of the century,
when the United' States was putting down the
Filipino national liberation movement led by Emilio
Aguinaldo, Edward Atkinson, an American

hernando tristero

laissez-faire liberal, sent anti-imperialist material to
American soldiers in the Philippines.
On May 2, 1899, Postmaster-General Charles
Emory Smith ordered his postmaster in San
Francisco to remove Atkinson's pamphlets from the
Manila mails. The Springfield Republican found in
the seizure "the mailed hand of the rule of blood
and iron being gradually disclosed . . . which will
next fall heavily upon freedom of speech within the
old borders of the United States."
Civil War-era jurist Lysander Spooner spoke
directly to the problem we all face when he wrote:
"Any law which compels a man to pay a certain
sum of money to the government for the privilege
of speaking to a distant individual, or which debars
him of the right of employing such a mesenger as he
perfers to entrust with his communications,
'abridges' his 'freedom of speech.' "
Post Office Conscription
A new and innovative link in the chain of social
control and suppression of freedom of discourse has
been added in our own time. In Ohio, truants,
whose violation of compulsory attendance laws was
deserting the public high school to attend anti-war
rallies, have as punishment been conscripted into
working for the Post Office.
What began as conscription of the people's
resources to finance the government post office and
included efforts to conscript the mind by
controlling communications, has now been
recognized to have new potential. Perhaps the
prototype of national service (servitude) we see in
Governor Ronald Reagan's Ecology Corps camps
will be extended to conscripting youth into the
postal system.
For the sake of free speech and a free society, we
must abolish the postal monopoly. (Hernando
Joaquin de Tristero y Calavera is a member of the
Stanford Radical Libertarian Alliance.)
Postage rates went up yesterday. It now costs
eight cents to mail the same first-class letters that I
can remember taking three-cent, purple "Statue of
Liberty" stamps.
Yesterday's rate hike and the recent
organizational re-shuffling in the Post Office are no
deviation from the pattern which emerges from the
Post Office's sorry history.
It is a pattern of political censorship,
comstockery, mail covers, patronage pay-offs, and
inefficient management. The United States Post
Office was set up in 1789; it went $40 into the red
that year. Being a losing proposition is a
time-honored custom in the Post Office.
Censorship Connection
We are familiar with the fact that officers censor
the mail enlisted men send home in wartime and the
fact that mail sent to and by prisoners in jail is
censored. But there seems to be little recognition of
how closely these two cases resemble the situation
in which we all find ourselves. For every
governmental decision banning pornography from
the mails or forcing recipients to register with the
government their desire to receive Marxist literature
sent to them from foreign countries, there is some
parallel possible interdiction which describes and
proscribes what we ourselves receive or send
through the mail.
The New York Times of March 31, 1971, carries
a story which begins: "A confidential Army
directive obtained from Vietnam shows that Army
commanders have been ordered to intercept and
confiscate personal, first-class mail containing
anti-war or other dissident publications sent to
soldiers here."
