fascism
Editor, THE DAILY:
On Tuesday night, May 11, I
came to the International Center
to relax and enjoy its facilities. On
entering the building, I was
amazed and shocked to see a flag
displayed that has, for 31 years,
represented fascism, oppression,
and organized political crime. This
flag represents the brutal
dictatorship presently ruling
Spain. This dictatorship, under
the head of "Generalising"
Francisco Franco, was imposed by
the military force of Adolf Hitler
and his allies.
To see this flag is to bring back
memories of torture, death, and
other cirmes against the Spanish
people, many of whom still fill
the jails of Spain today. These are
not just the crimes and injustices
of the past, but continue to the
present. To see this flag is to recall
to mind the poverty of the
Spanish people and the
suppression of their basic human
rights. This suppression, which
followed the destruction of the
Republic of Spain, its People, and
their Freedom, has continued
unceasingly since Franco took
over in 1939.
In the name of those Spaniaids
that fought and died for Freedom
during the Civil War... In the
name of those Spaniards that are
fighting today for the same
cause ... In the name of liberty
and justice, principles that are so
highly thought of in these United
States, I beg, please, do not
display this symbol of Fascism
and Oppression in front of the
International Center or elsewhere
on the campus.

For Peace
I received your letter of April
28, concerning your intention to
demonstrate your opposition to
the war in Southeast Asia by
blocking the entrance to the

Oakland Induction Center, just as
word came through that you had
done so, with 13 arrests resulting
from it. You ask for my support
of your actions. I know of no
form in which I can lend support,
but you do have my
understanding and respect for
your acts of witness to your
convictions.
I believe that any intentional
breach of law probably carries
with it some social cost in the
sense that respect for the law is
diminished thereby. That cost
may be worth paying, however, if
the wrong protested against is
sufficiently serious, and the
protest is accompanied by
willingness to submit to the
consequences. The bridge between
intrinsic respect for the law and
respect for a morality that
extends beyond human
instruments can be built by acts
of conscience, carefully weighed,
nonviolently performed, and kept
within the limits of respect for the
interests of others.
However, I believe that your
linking of this with my recent
statements concerning sit-ins at
Stanford reflects a degree of
confusion over the issue, or at
least over the intent and meaning
of my statements.
In attempting to make clear
that the University will move to
bring sit-ins to an end as
expeditiously as possible, I was
adding nothing and changing
nothing of the principles and
processes on which the University
acted in the past.
It is, of course, conceivable
that members of the University
might choose to violate University
policy deliberately, because they
could find no other way to call
attention to their opposition to
University policy, and be willing
to take the consequences in the
way of conviction and penalty, as
I infer from your letter and
subsequent actions you are willing
to do while bearing witness
against the war. But what gave rise
to my statement was not that
kind of principled resort to illegal
but nonviolent protest.
Rather, it was a very different
sort of sit-in, i.e., a coercive action
aimed at forcing the institution to

grant concessions or change
policies as the price of being
allowed to go on functioning, in
whole or in part. Furthermore, on
this occasion there was no
willingness to "bear witness" by
being identified and prosecuted
for the violation of law or policy
involved. Instead there was a
resort to barricades, followed by a
violent fight with police, initiated
by the demonstrators.
In short, to return to your
letter, I respect "individual acts of
conscience," but I think that the
difference between such acts and
acts of extortion and coercion
must be made clear, and be
recognized by all concerned.

graduation
Editor, THE DAILY:
After a week of maintaining a
table in front of the Bookstore, it
has become apparent to the
Disrobe for Peace Committee that
several aspects of the project need
clarification.
First of all, contrary to the
implication of the notice that was
sent to all degree candidates, Caps
and Gowns are not Required for
participation in commencement
exercises. According to the Public
Events Office, robes are only
(however strongly) recommended.
Graduating seniors, therefore,
need not fear exclusion for the
ceremony if they decide to donate
their cap and gown money to an
anti-war cause. The same is true
for recipients of masters and
doctoral degrees, with the
exception of law students, who', as
we understand, have been
required to wear gowns.
Secondly, this project was not
undertaken to imply in any way
that those who decide to wear
robes are against peace or do not

desire an end to the war.
Refusing to wear robes is
merely one of the ways some of
us have chosen to remind people
that the war is still on, that
despite the blue skies and warm
sun, despite the shining feelings of
pride and satisfaction that will
pervade commencement
ceremonies, and despite that
peaceful Sunday afternoon
euphoria that will make it appear
thaâ€ž all is well, all is not well!
We are destroying the land,
cultures, and peoples of Southeast
Asia. Those words have become a
cliche, but it does not appear
from our business-as-usual activity
that we understand their meaning.
In addition to the symbolic
act, the Disrobe for Peace
Committee feels that graduation
provides a good opportunity, or
excuse, if you wish, to help
groups that have, in fact, moved
beyond symbols to aclion. These
groups include the Agape
Foundation, the Committee of
Responsibility, Inc., and Draft
Refusers Support, one or all to
which people may contribute
either their cap and gown rental
fee or their deposit money.
We urge people at least to
consider the choice before them.
The message can be a powerful
one if many graduates participate.
