# Gunmen Rob Trailer
## 
### 
A Manzanita Trailer Park resident reported Wednesday, that he was
robbed of $71 by three armed men who allegedly held one of the
residents at gunpoint and demanded that he turn over "all his dope."
According to the victim, when the assailants were told by the
occupants of the trailer that there was no "dope," they proceeded to
ransack the living room. Unsuccessful in their attempts to find any,
one of the men allegedly held a neighbor on the floor and proceeded
to kick him in the ribs and back.
The assailants then left without any dope, but the victim reported
that his wallet with $71 inside was taken.
Police arrived at the trailer at 11:30 a.m. While investigating they
were reported to have seen some marijuana in a drawer. The detective
supposedly said, "We aren't here to make a dope bust, but are here to
apprehend criminals."
The alleged assailants, described by the victims as three blacks,
were then identified from photographs kept in Santa Clara County
files.
The victim proceeded to join the sheriffs in search of a car
described as "an old black car- a Plymouth or Buick, with a hot
engine. A car fitting that that description was spotted in the parking
lot between the Alumni and Black Houses.
According to the victim a group of five or six persons left Black
House and proceeded to move the car. One student, Elections
Commissioner Louis Humphrey, was asked by the sherriff if he knew
who the car belonged to. Humphrey replied that he did not. He said it
belonged to "a friend of a guy in the Black House." Humphrey also
said that he was told to move the car because it was parked illegally.
About this time, former BSU chairman, Leo Bazile, who was on his
way to Tresidder, came by to "see what was going on." According to
Bazile, a plainclothes policeman shook his finger in Bazile's face and
told him that he was interfering with the investigation. Bazile said that
he apologized for interfering and he and Humphrey went back to
Black House.
While inside Bazile said that Humphrey returned the car keys to
the person who gave them to him. All three then went outside where
the car owner was then questioned by the police. After a while Bazile
said he asked the officer if anyone was under arrest. When the officer
said no, the three of them left.
According to the Santa Clara County Sheriffs, the robbery is still
under investigation.
