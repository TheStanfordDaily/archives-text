# Con Home Week Aids Hospital Fund
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Con-Home week ended Friday
with relatively little fanfare, the
same way it had begun. This
annual Cardinal's Board-sponsored
event to raise funds for the
Stanford Children's Convalescent
Hospital seemed overshadowed by
other events, notably the BSU
Convocation on Institutional
Racism and midterms.
The on-campus events
consisted of three White Plaza
booths; a Mirlo-sponsored ice
cream stand, a Muir-manned crafts
and baked goods concession, and
a cotton candy booth staffed by
Durand House.
In addition a Lathrop party
helped to channel in funds. The
total amount of money raised will
not be known until after next
week when freshman solicitations
are completed.
Freshman solicitations plan to
have duos of freshman canvassing
community precincts at least two
afternoons a week, soliciting
funds. The collectors will try at
the same time to relate to the

community the work of the
Childrens Hospital.
Mila Ott, Cardinal's Board
member, related that an
off-campus carnival which had
been held in previous years "fell
through" this year. She also noted
that the hydra follies which are
held on campus would probably
not occur this year due to
financial problems of the
Cardinal's Board. This event
would require $500 to cover
insurance according to Mila and
the Cardinal' Board appears
unable to pay this sum.
The money raised will be used
to help complete construction
payments on the new eight unit
Hospital complex completed in
1969. For this, $1,500,000 is
needed in addition to an
endowment increase of
$5,500,000 by 1974 to finance
expanded programs of medical
and rehabilitative care.
Such funding drives are being
coordinated by the hospital's
"Progress Fund" organization, a
group originally formed when the
old structures of the hospital built

in 1970,1928, and 1929 were con
demned by the State Fire Mar
shall's office and the Bureau of
Hospitals as no longer being suit
able for occupancy by cronically ill
and crippled young patients.
The Children's Hospital itself is
affiliated with the Medical School
and is staffed by Medical School
faculty, as well as private
physicians working on a variety of
chronic disease and physical
rehabilitation problems. The
Hospital provides rehabilitation
and long-term care of children
suffering from rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and
birth defects just to name a few of
the physical disorders and chronic
diseases.
Positive results have been
achieved through the integration
of medical supervision, planning,
and care by teams of trained
specialists working on the 26 acre
site acquired from the University.
Aside from its proximity to the
University and association with
the School of Medicine, the
Children's Hospital is partly
staffed by Student volunteers.

Karen Hoffman, a senior in
History, related her experience as
an assistant to a physical
education instructor.
"Once a week I worked with
kids who wanted to play under a
directed study program from the
Physical Education Department
here. The kids are sometimes
moody but are happy to do
anything outside whether
throwing a ball through a hoop or
bowling. It is amazing how kids
overcome what is wrong."
Hoffman observed that there is
a real need for male students who
can do this kind of work on a
regular basis and provide a model
and a "good buddy" for
handicapped children. She felt
that this could easily be arranged
through the Hospital.
The academic teaching which
complements the physical and
recreational therapy is handled by
the Palo Alto Univied School
District at all grade levels, so
hospitalized students may
continue their studies.
No child has even been refused
admission to the Children's
Hospital for financial reasons, so
operating deficits do exist. To
continue its work the Hospital
depends on gifts, donations and
the continued support of its fund
raising auxiliaries.

other events, notably the BSU
Convocation on Institutional
Racism and midterms.
The on-campus events
consisted of three White Plaza
booths; a Mirlo-sponsored ice
cream stand, a Muir-manned crafts
and baked goods concession, and
a cotton candy booth staffed by
Durand House.
In addition a Lathrop party
helped to channel in funds. The
total amount of money raised will
not be known until after next
week when freshman solicitations
are completed.
Freshman solicitations plan to
have duos of freshman canvassing
community precincts at least two
afternoons a week, soliciting
funds. The collectors will try at
the same time to relate to the

community the work of the
Childrens Hospital.
Mila Ott, Cardinal's Board
member, related that an
off-campus carnival which had
been held in previous years "fell
through" this year. She also noted
that the hydra follies which are
held on campus would probably
not occur this year due to
financial problems of the
Cardinal's Board. This event
would require $500 to cover
insurance according to Mila and
the Cardinal' Board appears
unable to pay this sum.
The money raised will be used
to help complete construction
payments on the new eight unit
Hospital complex completed in
1969. For this, $1,500,000 is
needed in addition to an
endowment increase of
$5,500,000 by 1974 to finance
expanded programs of medical
and rehabilitative care.
Such funding drives are being
coordinated by the hospital's
"Progress Fund" organization, a
group originally formed when the
old structures of the hospital built

in 1970,1928, and 1929 were con
demned by the State Fire Mar
shall's office and the Bureau of
Hospitals as no longer being suit
able for occupancy by cronically ill
and crippled young patients.
The Children's Hospital itself is
affiliated with the Medical School
and is staffed by Medical School
faculty, as well as private
physicians working on a variety of
chronic disease and physical
rehabilitation problems. The
Hospital provides rehabilitation
and long-term care of children
suffering from rheumatoid
arthritis, asthma, diabetes, and
birth defects just to name a few of
the physical disorders and chronic
diseases.
Positive results have been
achieved through the integration
of medical supervision, planning,
and care by teams of trained
specialists working on the 26 acre
site acquired from the University.
Aside from its proximity to the
University and association with
the School of Medicine, the
Children's Hospital is partly
staffed by Student volunteers.

Karen Hoffman, a senior in
History, related her experience as
an assistant to a physical
education instructor.
"Once a week I worked with
kids who wanted to play under a
directed study program from the
Physical Education Department
here. The kids are sometimes
moody but are happy to do
anything outside whether
throwing a ball through a hoop or
bowling. It is amazing how kids
overcome what is wrong."
Hoffman observed that there is
a real need for male students who
can do this kind of work on a
regular basis and provide a model
and a "good buddy" for
handicapped children. She felt
that this could easily be arranged
through the Hospital.
The academic teaching which
complements the physical and
recreational therapy is handled by
the Palo Alto Univied School
District at all grade levels, so
hospitalized students may
continue their studies.
No child has even been refused
admission to the Children's
Hospital for financial reasons, so
operating deficits do exist. To
continue its work the Hospital
depends on gifts, donations and
the continued support of its fund
raising auxiliaries.
Con-Home week ended Friday
with relatively little fanfare, the
same way it had begun. This
annual Cardinal's Board-sponsored
event to raise funds for the
Stanford Children's Convalescent
Hospital seemed overshadowed by
other events, notably the BSU
Convocation on Institutional
Racism and midterms.
