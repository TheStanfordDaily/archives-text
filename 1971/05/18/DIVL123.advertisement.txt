Today In The 'Daily'
Today is Tuesday, May 18, 1971. One year ago today, White
House Director of Communications Herbert G. Klein called U.S.
military operations in Cambodia a "story of success" that
would enhance President Nixon's credibility. As if President
Nixon's credibility was ever in doubt!
If you hear of any success stories, call our news editor at
ext. 4632. If you'd like to help one of the Horatio Alger in our
business office achieve his dream of success, call ext. 4630 and
place an ad.
Daily staff lunch at noon today.
