# Affirmative Action Plan Seeks Equality For Women
## 
### KATHY WEINBERGER 
"Women arc fundamentally weaker than men in all that
makes for endurance, in muscular strength, in nervous
energy, in the power of persistent application and
attention."
—Decision of the U.S. Supreme Court, MulJer vs.
Oregon, 1 908.
Attitudes have changed over the past 60 years. But in
the area of sex discrimination, many feel that society has
stagnant; only the rhetoric has become more
subtle.
At Stanford, an attempt is currently underway to
alleviate the problems of discrimination against women in
at least one important area—that of employment. In
February , Anne Miner was asked by President Lyman to
study the University's policies and practices of employment
of women and to recommend changes "needed to achieve
the elimination of sex discrimination in employment
actions." She took a temporary leave from her duties in the
General Secretary's office to work on this study, which will
culminate in a report to President Lyman in June.

Miner sees the employment problem at Stanford as quite
similar to that at other universities. "There is no problem in
getting women employees at Stanford," she said. "The
problem is where the women are working. We need to talk
about redistributing workers so that not all women are
given menipi jobs.
Special Problems
According to Miner, it is important not to ignore the
special problems that minority women face in employment.
"We don't want to confirm the beliefs of those who see
women's liberation as a substitute for dealing with with the
problems of discrimination that minorities face. You can't
administratively divorce the two."
Miner cited as an example, the case of a white women
with a Masters degree who is given a secretarial job, while a
minority woman with a high school diploma who is
qualified for the secretarial job is not hired at all
Miner thinks the difficulties with fair employment for
women stem mostly from unwritten informal practices
rather than from existing written policies. She explained
that the personnel office attempted to remove sex
differentiation from some of its official forms.
No longer is a woman applicant asked how many
children she has unless men are also asked. Job descriptions
no longer describe all managers as "he" while describing
office workers as "she."
A recent ruling from the Provost's office has ended any
hiring restrictions based on fear of nepotism. Now, there is
no policy prohibiting employment of a husband and wife in
the same department, even if one is the department
chairman. The only restriction is against the chairman
participating in a tenure decision concerning his or her
spouse.
Practice, Not Policies
Some institutional policies are not intended to
discriminate against women, but in practice they have that
tendency. Miner cites the policy on maternity leaves as an
example. She claims that the leaves are technically
permissible now, but they are not really viewed as a right,
as they should be.

"Stanford needs to publicize and clarify such policies,"
she said. "However, the University is very decentralized and
people do all kinds of things in their departments" which
are discriminatory.
Miner's job is to suggest how to end this unwritten
discrimination.
"Affirmative action" describes a plan to create
institutional change. Miner believes, as do spokesmen for
most minority groups, that discrimination will not
magically end once an institution claims to be an equal
opportunity employer.
"An institution has to take an affirmative stand, has to
recruit minority employees, in order to actually be
non-discriminitory. We have learned that institutions need
to adopt the same approach for ending discrimination
against women," she said.
She envisions a plan to recruit more women faculty,
more women on committees, and create a better balanced
representation of minority and non-minority women in
staff jobs.
Keep The Culture In Mind
Although her current position as consultant to the
President primarily involves working to improve women's
positions at Stanford, Miner is actually concerned with
more than just the University. "Institutionally, I'm
concerned with how Stanford can be a better employer for
women," she said, "but you must take the whole question
of sex-role stereotyping into accoung when making
institutional changes. You make intelligent choices as to
what is important in relation to the entire culture."
She emphasizes the need to discourage highly
sex-stereotyped jobs, because the female almost always
ends up with lower pay, even if she has a great deal of
expertise.
Institutional changes alone will not end the
discrimination against-women problem. "Even if the
University took a very forward-looking and aggressive
stance on employment of women, there is not now enough
sense in the community that this is an important issue," she
said. Miner worries that community awareness will be much

more difficult to achieve on a large scale than mere changes
in the institution itself.
Not An Arm
"But we shouldn't delude ourselves that the goal of
Stanford University is to be an arm of women's liberation,"
she added. "It's not. Stanford's role is not to reform
society—though some people think it should be."
Although Miner herself has not been responsible for
inviting women's liberation-minded guest speakers such as
Aileen Hernandez of NOW and Germaine Greer, author of
The Female Eunuch, to speak on campus, she says she is
glad they have come "so we can build a little community
understanding."
Miner assumes that people will have little difficulty
adjusting to women's new positions in the University.
"People will have to learn. They now assume strange things,
such as the common belief that women working for other
women will fight.
"This is an example of fear of the unknown. Once
women are there, they will do the job and relate to one
another. The problem will be getting the bodies there- the
rest will follow."

WOMEN'S ADVOCATE—Anne Miner, appointed by
President Lyman to study job discrimination against
women, has found Stanford to be not unlike many other
universities—the problem is not as much the number of
women hired as it is what positions they hold.

LACK OF AWARENESS—"There is not now enough sense
in the community that discrimination against women is an
important issue ' 112 said Anne Miner. "We need to build some
understanding.
