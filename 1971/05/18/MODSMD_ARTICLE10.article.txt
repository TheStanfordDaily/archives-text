posts for the present.
The appointment was made upon

and Computer Science Departments.
Support For Lyman
Over 1,000 Stanford students,
faculty and staff members to date have
signed a letter of support to University

members sponsored the document.
The returns to date are weighted
heavily with the signatures of staff
employees, who constitute nearly
two-thirds of the signers. The

"We, the undersigned, wish to
express our full support of your efforts
to solve the problems of unrest and
discord on this campus. We abhor
non-negotiable demands by any group
for whatever reason, unequivocally

Support For Lyman
Over 1,000 Stanford students,
faculty and staff members to date have
signed a letter of support to University
President Richard W. Lyman. The letter
offers to help him end "unrest and
discord" on the campus.
The letter was privately initiated and
circulated by staff employees. A
17-member group of faculty and staff
members sponsored the document.
The returns to date are weighted
heavily with the signatures of staff
employees, who constitute nearly
two-thirds of the signers. The
remainder is about equally divided
between student and faculty signatures.

Addressed to President Lyman, the
letter reads:
"We, the undersigned, wish to
express our full support of your efforts
to solve the problems of unrest and
discord on this campus. We abhor
non-negotiable demands by any group
for whatever reason, unequivocally
condemn coercion and violence as
instruments of change within a
democratic system, and support
rational negotiation of differences.."
