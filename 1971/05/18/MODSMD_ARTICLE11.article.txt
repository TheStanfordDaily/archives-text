# UCCM Budget Cuts Stand; Minister's Firing Likely
## 
### 
The continued employment of a
radical member of the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM) was put in
doubt Saturday when United Ministries
in Higher Education, the Northern
California regional parent of UCCM,
upheld a disputed $14,000 budget cut.
UCCM had protested the cut-back
but the budget reduction was
nevertheless approved by a 20-3 vote.
The cut is expected to be
implemented by the dismissal of either
Richard Roe or Joseph Hardegree, the
two UCCM ministers here. Hardegree, a

self-proclaimed radical, has said that he
"informally" understands that he will
be the one dismissed.
A meeting of the local UCCM
governing board will be held tonight at
7:30 p.m. in the Clubhouse to
formulate a response to the cut.
The UCCM board is comprised of
representatives of six local Protestant
churches, several students, and several
campus Protestants. Political Science
Professor David Abernathy is
Chairman.
The meeting will be closed to the
public.
