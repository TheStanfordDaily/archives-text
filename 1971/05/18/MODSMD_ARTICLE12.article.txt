Rail Strike Begins
WASHINGTON — A nationwide railroad strike sent mounting ripples of paralysis
through much of the economy for the second day today as Congress considered
an emergency bill to halt the walkout.
Major steel and automobile firms slashed production, tons of perishable foods
piled up on rail sidings, 300,000 commuters had to find other transportation and
the New York stock market suffered its sharpest loss in a year.
President Nixon, telling Congress "it is essential that our railroads continue to
operate," asked the strike be halted until July 1 to allow more time for the
industry to bargain with the 13,000 members of the striking Brotherhood of
Railroad Signalmen.
The Senate Labor Committee, after hearing from the railroads, the union and
Nixon administration spokesmen, indicated sentiment for extending the delay to
Oct. 1 and writing signalmen an immediate pay increase.
Both sides in the dispute promised to abide by such a plan which would raise
top pay for signalmen from the present $3.80 an hour to $4.46.
Payments Deficit Increases
WASHINGTON — The deficit in the U.S. balance of payments took a sharp and
record-breaking turn for the worse from January through March, the government
said yesterday.
A yardstick which measures transactions with foreign governments and foreign
central banks showed the first-quarter payments deficit climbed to a record $5.5
billion.
Another measure of the balance of payments taking into account all foreign
transactions set the first-quarter deficit at $3 billion, the second-highest on record.
"Those results are bad," Treasury Secretary John B. Connally told a Senate
Finance subcommittee. "Clearly, that level of deficit is not sustainable."
The sharp rise in deficit mirrored the causes for the recent international
monetary crisis in which the dollar eroded in value in relation to other currencies
in Europe.
Two main reasons have been given for the dollar crisis, the continuing high U.S.
balance-of-payments deficit and a rapid flow of dollars to Europe where interest
rates are higher.
