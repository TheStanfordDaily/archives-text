# Membership Decline Puts Frats Into Debt
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
A Dean of Students Office report
issued last week revealed that 17 of
Stanford's 19 fraternities are in debt to
the University.
The paper "Fraternities at
Stanford", dated April 30th and
distributed to all fraternities, states that
"17 fraternities have a debt to the
University resulting from inability to
make monthly payments on rent and
current operating expenses." These
debts, says the report, range "from
$200 to $27,000" and are primarily
caused by drops in membership.
The statement, has drawn fire from
several houses because of some new
University policies which the statement
contains. These new policies require
that:
—each house maintain membership
above an established minimum level; if
the membership drops below minimum,
the house will be given one year's
probation, then ordered to close if
membership has not increased;
- any house owing over $3,000 to
the University submit a repayment plan
by May 31 or be prohibited from
opening next fall;
—each house submit a financial
statement to the University every
quarter.
Many fraternity members have
labelled the document "too negative."
University administrators, however,
contend that the new regulations
represent "a positive attempt" to help
out currently weak houses.
Fraternities in housing clusters seem
to be suffering the most. Members
claim their difficulties began when they
were forced to move into new houses
too large for their needs. The newest
cluster, near Cowell Health Center,
originally housed five fraternities, two
have since gone co-ed, one has moved
back into an older house, and a fourth
will move by next fall.
Fraternity problems are
compounded by the fact that small
co-ed and theme houses offer attractive
housing alternatives; the frats must
compete with these houses for
members. Besides the advantages of
co-educational living, these houses

often are viewed as being more flexible
than fraternities.
At least one fraternity here has
entered the Housing Draw, as a member
of the house said, "to attract people
who want to experiment with living
alternatives."
Some University administrators have
advocated a University-wide housing
system, based on a draw, which would
include fraternities. Although this
housing plan is as yet mere conjecture,
many fraternity men fear the recent
policy statement as the first step in
establishing such a housing
amalgamation.
Others view the new policies as the
beginning of an anti-fraternity
campaign on the part of the University.
The minimum membership
requirement has drawn the heaviest
criticism. Hardest hit by the
requirement are the cluster houses,
which must pay rent and operating
costs to the University.


MORE TROUBLE TO COME—After violence flared last Saturday in Berkeley the
publishing board of the DAILY CALIFORNIAN met to consider punitive action
against members of the paper's editorial board. The DAILY CAL published a
front-page editorial last Tuesday advocating retaking of the People's Park.
