# People's Park Controversy
## 'Daily Cal' Faces Possible Censure 
### TOM GIVEN 
A review board postponed a decision
yesterday on whether or not to punish
editors of the Daily Californian, the
U.C. Berkeley student newspaper, for
an editorial last week urging people to
"take back" People's Park, and have a
party there.
A majority of the 11-man Publishing
Board indicated that they would
support some sort of disciplinary
action. The board composed of
students, faculty, and administrators, is
empowered to suspend, fire, censure or
dock the paychecks of Daily Cal
personnel.
A resolution to fire four of the five
members of the Student Editorial
Board was amended to exclude the

editor-in-chief, John Emschwiller. Still
facing possible penalties are City Editor
Trish Hall, Opinions Editor David
Dozier, and Junior Staff Representative
James Blodgett.
The board postponed its decision to
allow the editors a chance to consider
the defense and to work out new
procedures for approval of editorials.
Daily Cal staff members refused to
comment, pending the publishing
board's decision.
The University Board of Regents are
also expected to take action against the
paper. According to University sources a
group of Regents will meet informally
today to discuss, among other things,
the possible immediate cessation of
University subsidies to all student
newspapers in the California state
system, the New York Times reported
yesterday.
The Regents have been angered by
stories and actions of student papers on
all nine of the University campuses
during the past few years. They will
hold their regular meeting in San
Francisco on Thursday and Friday.
The controversy over the Daily Cal's
editorials began last week when a
front-page editorial urged readers to
"retake the park." It was not explicit in
how the park should be re-taken but it
suggested donations of food, dope,
wine, or wire-cutters to an effort to
"take it back in the same spirit as it was
first taken with joy and spontaneity
and dedication."

It also said that, "we don't intend to
provoke any violence because we think
it doesn't take any violence to pull
down a fence."
In Thursday's paper, there were
majority and minority editorials, with
the majority of the staff supporting the
initial statements. A unanimous
editorial issued Friday urged dedication
of the park in a spirit of nonviolence.
Daily Cal staff members attended
Saturday's demonstration, urging
demonstrators to remain nonviolent.
Nonetheless, the second anniversary of

Bloody Thursday, when James Rector
was killed and another student blinded,
was marked by minor violence.
A group of 1000 demonstrators
attempted to tear down the fence
surrounding the park site, resulting in
44 arrests and eight injuries. Police
dispersed the crowd with tear gas,
pepper fog, and nonlethal ricochet
bullets.
People's park, which is owned by
the University, is now the site of a
soccer field and two parking lots. It has
remained largely unused by students
for the past two years.

attempted to tear down the fence
surrounding the park site, resulting in
44 arrests and eight injuries. Police
dispersed the crowd with tear gas,
pepper fog, and nonlethal ricochet
bullets.
People's park, which is owned by
the University, is now the site of a
soccer field and two parking lots. It has
remained largely unused by students
for the past two years.
A review board postponed a decision
yesterday on whether or not to punish
editors of the Daily Californian, the
U.C. Berkeley student newspaper, for
an editorial last week urging people to
"take back" People's Park, and have a
party there.
A majority of the 11-man Publishing
Board indicated that they would
support some sort of disciplinary
action. The board composed of
students, faculty, and administrators, is
empowered to suspend, fire, censure or
dock the paychecks of Daily Cal
personnel.
A resolution to fire four of the five
members of the Student Editorial
Board was amended to exclude the

editor-in-chief, John Emschwiller. Still
facing possible penalties are City Editor
Trish Hall, Opinions Editor David
Dozier, and Junior Staff Representative
James Blodgett.
The board postponed its decision to
allow the editors a chance to consider
the defense and to work out new
procedures for approval of editorials.
Daily Cal staff members refused to
comment, pending the publishing
board's decision.
The University Board of Regents are
also expected to take action against the
paper. According to University sources a
group of Regents will meet informally
today to discuss, among other things,
the possible immediate cessation of
University subsidies to all student
newspapers in the California state
system, the New York Times reported
yesterday.
The Regents have been angered by
stories and actions of student papers on
all nine of the University campuses
during the past few years. They will
hold their regular meeting in San
Francisco on Thursday and Friday.
The controversy over the Daily Cal's
editorials began last week when a
front-page editorial urged readers to
"retake the park." It was not explicit in
how the park should be re-taken but it
suggested donations of food, dope,
wine, or wire-cutters to an effort to
"take it back in the same spirit as it was
first taken with joy and spontaneity
and dedication."

It also said that, "we don't intend to
provoke any violence because we think
it doesn't take any violence to pull
down a fence."
In Thursday's paper, there were
majority and minority editorials, with
the majority of the staff supporting the
initial statements. A unanimous
editorial issued Friday urged dedication
of the park in a spirit of nonviolence.
Daily Cal staff members attended
Saturday's demonstration, urging
demonstrators to remain nonviolent.
Nonetheless, the second anniversary of

Bloody Thursday, when James Rector
was killed and another student blinded,
was marked by minor violence.
A group of 1000 demonstrators
attempted to tear down the fence
surrounding the park site, resulting in
44 arrests and eight injuries. Police
dispersed the crowd with tear gas,
pepper fog, and nonlethal ricochet
bullets.
