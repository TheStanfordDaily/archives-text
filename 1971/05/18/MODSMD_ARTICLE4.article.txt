# Experimental Program To Begin
## 
### 
The humanities, social sciences, and
natural sciences will be united this fall
in Stanford's newest interdisciplinary
special program.
The experimental program in
"Values, Technology, and Society,"
consisting of nine courses, will bring
together specialists from more than ten
academic disciplines to study "man, his
hopes, his environment, and his
society."
A number of the classes will be small
seminars, with as many as three faculty
members leading each course. Courses
scheduled for the program include:
"Comparative World Views and
Scientific Thought," "The Professions

in Our Society," and "Human Values
and Contemporary Society."
If the program, which will be
evaluated hv all participants from the
start, is successful, more courses will be
added, moving toward a complete
undergraduate program in 1972-73.
The program will be administered by
the Department of Humanities Special
Programs, which consists of
interdisciplinary and extradepartmental
programs.
William A. Clebsch, chairman of the
department, explains the rationale for
the program: w lt is the duty of
education to integrate knowledge, not
just hand it out in separate pieces and
leave it up to the students to try to
integrate it themselves.

"Each of the three fields is available,
of course, but there is no real impact
until they are brought together to show
how all scholarly specialties boar on the
understanding of man and his society.
"The main idea is not to make
scientists out of non-scientists or vice
versa, but to enable each to understand
the work of the other," he said
Pat Windham. a sophomore
interested in the program, feels that
"Since technology is such a pervasive
force in the world today; by focusing
on that today, we can better
understand our society and the world."
Some organizers of the program feel
that it may become a type of general
education for the 20th century.
