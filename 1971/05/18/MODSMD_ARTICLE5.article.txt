# Alumni See Stanford As 'More Decisive'
## 
### 
Stanford graduates, especially those
living in the Bay Area, believe the
University has become "more decisive"
in responding to campus disruption and
violence, a survey released last week
indicates.
Responses from 4,000 degree
holders show 60 percent feel the
University has become "more decisive
than it was," while 17 percent believe it
is about the same, one percent regard it
as less decisive, and the rest don't know
or have no opinion.
The survey is one in a continuing
series by the Stanford Alumni
Association. It was conducted in March
and April, just prior to the bombing of
the President's Office and the burning
of the Junipero House lounge.
No Conspiracy
The survey showed that two-thirds
of the University's graduates disagree
with the idea that "there is actually
some kind of conspiracy afoot to
destroy our universities." In the fall of

1969, alumni felt Stanford "seems to
have handled . . . problems better than
most" other universities by a 2 to 1
margin. By this spring, however,
opinion on this question had become
evenly divided.
Alumni Association Director
Thomas Newell, a former research
analyst with the Gallup Poll, said this
finding "is understandable in the light
of wide publicity given the many
demonstrations and the widespread
trashing last spring."
In response to the statement "Much
of the blame for student disorders
should be laid to faculty members who
either encourage disruptive behavior or
do nothing to discourage it," 54
percent agreed while 37 percent
disagreed.
Neighbors More Opinionated
Those who live closest to the
campus were more likely to have an
opinion and to regard the University's
response to .disruption as being more
decisive than those living elsewhere in
the state or nation.
Out of every 10 graduates living in
the Bay Area, seven believe the
University is now "more decisive," two
say it's about the same, and one has no
opin ion.
Among those living outside
California, half feel Stanford is now
more decisive, but more than a third
have no opinion or don't know.
The survey results are based on
questionaires sent a randomly selected
sample of one-tenth of all the
University's degree holders. The
response rate exceeded 60 percent.
Alumni Association President
William F. Kartozian called the results
of the survey "heartening" evidence
that "alumni are aware of the
decisiveness President Lyman has
exibited in the face of extremely
complex and difficult problems."
