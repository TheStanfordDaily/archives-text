Editor, THE DAILY:
At the BSU seminar on
institutional racism last Thursday,
I was asked to address my remarks
to whites. In so doing, I ended
with a strong plea for
non-violence on the part of
whites. Indeed, the plea was
strong enough so that a subsequent
speaker, not sharing my
viewpoint, referred to it as an
example of the typical white
liberal cop-out.
I am therefore much concerned
at the wrong implication that can
be drawn (and has been drawn by
a number of people) from the
brief reference to my remarks in
Friday's Daily, where I am
reported only as saying that
non-violent tactics are something
that "I don't think I'm entitled to
suggest for minority people." This

seems to imply, contrary to my
intent, that I endorse or
encourage violence by blacks.
What I was trying to say was
that the plea for non-violence as
an appropriate strategy for
minority groups comes most
convincingly from members of
such groups themselves; when
Cesar Chavez, or Martin Luther
King, or Archbishop Helder
Comara of Brazil, urge and
embody non-violence, nobody can
write them off as examples of
"the typical white liberal
cop-out."
Thus while I have no reason to
expect that members of minority
groups will listen very seriously
to me on this point, I do expect and
hope that they will listen very
seriously indeed to such men as
those cited above.
indeed to such men as those cited
above.
I undoubedly made the point

awkwardly in the Old Student
Union Courtyard and hope that
the above statement clears the air,
for it is the farthest thing from
my mind - or heart - to want to
encourage violence on the
campus, where I believe it can
only have counter-productive
results.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The ASSU Council of
Presidents' personal attack on
Pres. Lyman in Friday's Daily
makes us sad. Pres. Lyman's
long-term record against racism
requires no defense. But how
defend the ASSU Council of
Presidents, so talented as
individuals, who collectively assail
the motives of those who fail to
march to their drum? This kind of
tactic will keep the ASSU strident
and ineffective.
There must be room
somewhere in any university for
people who won't vote "yes" or
"no" to a package of one or two
dozen demands, of which they
support some and reject others.
Are all these people racists?
