## Frantz Fanon Revisited 
### 
sieve langdon

The power and potency of the thought of Germaine Greer lies in
her ability to move beyond the ordinary rhetoric about liberating
women in this culture and society from their humdrum, mindless
existence and sexual exploitation, to more profound concerns for the
liberation of all humans from the brutalization of this system.
The woman has a powerful tool, her feminity, with which to effect
the radical humanization of modern man. Miss Greer seeks an atypical
revolution; a revolution which rather than replacing one powerful elite
with another, will do away with power completely. To effect such a
change, she implies that a combination of all oppressed peoples into a
revolutionary front is necessary.
At the very least such revolutionary movements should not
dissipate essential energy through in-fighting, the result of which can
only be the weakening of such movements and the strengthening of
the white male decision-makers. Her image of the ironic confrontation
between black policemen and women in front of the Pentagon is an
extremely striking portrayal of the oppressed destroying the
oppressed.
Although these sentiments appear quite laudatory superficially, 1
have an acute and actual rather than a vague sense of uneasiness as to
exactly where Germaine Greer's revolutionary fervor has its psychic
source, particularly with regard to racism, sexism and blackness in
America.
This feeling finds an empirical foundation in a quotation from Miss
Greer which appeared in a recent issue of Jet magazine and which she
repeated at last Thursday's noon rally (which in reality and despite
Miss Greer's protestations may be seen as an advertising gimmick, the
hip revolutionary's equivalent of an author autograph party, both
rally and party being primarily designed to give public exposure to the
author in order to increase book sales).
The quotation by Miss Greer is, "I would rather have a child by a
black man than a white man;" she further elaborated on this
statement Thursday giving some deference to the legitimacy of the
black woman's angry response to such a position and expressing a
desire to be worthy of sisterhood with her black counterpart.
Her explanation was that a white woman's giving birth to a black
child in this society "niggerizes" (Miss Greer's term) both the child
and the mother thus making the white mother in some sense black
and providing an entry into the black experience. Miss Greer went on
to note that actually she preferred being brown to being white.
What we have in Miss Greer seems to be a living example of Frantz
Fanon's explanatory analysis of miscegenation turned on its head. In
Black Skins, White Masks, Fanon points out that the black woman
who seeks a child by a white man is engaging in identification with the
oppressor. By associating with the white man, she in some sense
becomes white obtaining legitimacy and power from this
identification. She is thus alienated from herself and attempts to

escape her own blackness by becoming the concubine of the white
master.
Calvin Hernton in Sex and Racism in America makes some of the
same points. But what do we find in Miss Greer's statements? She
obviously seeks identification with the oppressed through the black
man's oppression and the oppression that she and her child would
receive. The implications of this particular form of identification with
the downtrodden are threefold.
Firstly, it displays the fact that Miss Greer does not really feel
oppressed as a white woman or at least not as oppressed as black
Americans are and as her fervent wish is to be oppressed, what better
way to that end than by becoming black? Secondly, her statement
concerning her own preference for brown over white uncovers a basic
alienation from herself, not as a woman per se but from her whiteness
and its manifestation in her past role as Ultrafeminine Doll.
Finally is it not possible that such self-alienation and identification
with blacks produces in Miss Greer the incarnation of Lula, the white
woman of Baraka's (Leßoi Jones) Dutchman, who seeks to suck the
vitality and essence which she has forfeited for the pleasures of
capitalistic materialism from the black man, in the play represented
by Clay?
I have not contended that women are not oppressed in this society
because I firmly believe that they are. However their oppression is not
the same nor is it as intense as that of the black individual in this
society. There exists a pleasurable and comfortable role for the white
woman in the society as the Ultrafeminine Doll if she chooses to opt
for it.
The psychic damage to a woman's self-image is of a totally
different nature than the constant economic and physical oppression
of blacks who have no role option, no physically comfortable
alternative to retreat to if the going gets too rough. Miss Greer thus
does not and cannot feel as oppressed as a black without becoming
one; she retains a sense of guilt for being white and for not being as
oppressed as she wished she were.
The miscegenated relationship (blackman, white woman; white
man, black woman) in modern society is a tenuous and strained one,
compromised by untold pressures from both racial groups, black and
white, as well as difficulties in the individual psychic constructs and
motivations of the two persons involved. Although an extremely rare
occurence in this society, a successful interracial relationship is
transcendent; it requires two exceptionally mature people, both
having a sympathetic understanding as well as a deep emotional
feeling for the other, in addition to a strong, stable sense of self by
which I mean the recognition of who one is, where one comes from
and what one believes.
Needless to say Miss Greer's self-alienation does not provide a
foundation for such a transcendent relationship: in fact she wishes,
once again, to use the black man to reach her own egocentric ends -
that is obtaining a complete feeling of oppression which she now
lacks.
Finally Miss Greer is totally correct in her cry for the destruction
of our present system but she must recognize that sexism and racism
are not the same thing and that the oppression due to the former pales
in comparison with the letter.
To move forward with the humanization of modern man we do not
need these useless attempts to who and what one is and can be. Only
when this is clearly recognized and obtained can we hope to find
legitimate steps toward change and coming together.

alienation from herself, not as a woman per se but from her whiteness
and its manifestation in her past role as Ultrafeminine Doll.
Finally is it not possible that such self-alienation and identification
with blacks produces in Miss Greer the incarnation of Lula, the white
woman of Baraka's (Leßoi Jones) Dutchman, who seeks to suck the
vitality and essence which she has forfeited for the pleasures of
capitalistic materialism from the black man, in the play represented
by Clay?
I have not contended that women are not oppressed in this society
because I firmly believe that they are. However their oppression is not
the same nor is it as intense as that of the black individual in this
society. There exists a pleasurable and comfortable role for the white
woman in the society as the Ultrafeminine Doll if she chooses to opt
for it.
The psychic damage to a woman's self-image is of a totally
different nature than the constant economic and physical oppression
of blacks who have no role option, no physically comfortable
alternative to retreat to if the going gets too rough. Miss Greer thus
does not and cannot feel as oppressed as a black without becoming
one; she retains a sense of guilt for being white and for not being as
oppressed as she wished she were.
The miscegenated relationship (blackman, white woman; white
man, black woman) in modern society is a tenuous and strained one,
compromised by untold pressures from both racial groups, black and
white, as well as difficulties in the individual psychic constructs and
motivations of the two persons involved. Although an extremely rare
occurence in this society, a successful interracial relationship is
transcendent; it requires two exceptionally mature people, both
having a sympathetic understanding as well as a deep emotional
feeling for the other, in addition to a strong, stable sense of self by
which I mean the recognition of who one is, where one comes from
and what one believes.
Needless to say Miss Greer's self-alienation does not provide a
foundation for such a transcendent relationship: in fact she wishes,
once again, to use the black man to reach her own egocentric ends -
that is obtaining a complete feeling of oppression which she now
lacks.
Finally Miss Greer is totally correct in her cry for the destruction
of our present system but she must recognize that sexism and racism
are not the same thing and that the oppression due to the former pales
in comparison with the letter.
To move forward with the humanization of modern man we do not
need these useless attempts to who and what one is and can be. Only
when this is clearly recognized and obtained can we hope to find
legitimate steps toward change and coming together.

The power and potency of the thought of Germaine Greer lies in
her ability to move beyond the ordinary rhetoric about liberating
women in this culture and society from their humdrum, mindless
existence and sexual exploitation, to more profound concerns for the
liberation of all humans from the brutalization of this system.
The woman has a powerful tool, her feminity, with which to effect
the radical humanization of modern man. Miss Greer seeks an atypical
revolution; a revolution which rather than replacing one powerful elite
with another, will do away with power completely. To effect such a
change, she implies that a combination of all oppressed peoples into a
revolutionary front is necessary.
At the very least such revolutionary movements should not
dissipate essential energy through in-fighting, the result of which can
only be the weakening of such movements and the strengthening of
the white male decision-makers. Her image of the ironic confrontation
between black policemen and women in front of the Pentagon is an
extremely striking portrayal of the oppressed destroying the
oppressed.
Although these sentiments appear quite laudatory superficially, 1
have an acute and actual rather than a vague sense of uneasiness as to
exactly where Germaine Greer's revolutionary fervor has its psychic
source, particularly with regard to racism, sexism and blackness in
America.
This feeling finds an empirical foundation in a quotation from Miss
Greer which appeared in a recent issue of Jet magazine and which she
repeated at last Thursday's noon rally (which in reality and despite
Miss Greer's protestations may be seen as an advertising gimmick, the
hip revolutionary's equivalent of an author autograph party, both
rally and party being primarily designed to give public exposure to the
author in order to increase book sales).
The quotation by Miss Greer is, "I would rather have a child by a
black man than a white man;" she further elaborated on this
statement Thursday giving some deference to the legitimacy of the
black woman's angry response to such a position and expressing a
desire to be worthy of sisterhood with her black counterpart.
Her explanation was that a white woman's giving birth to a black
child in this society "niggerizes" (Miss Greer's term) both the child
and the mother thus making the white mother in some sense black
and providing an entry into the black experience. Miss Greer went on
to note that actually she preferred being brown to being white.
What we have in Miss Greer seems to be a living example of Frantz
Fanon's explanatory analysis of miscegenation turned on its head. In
Black Skins, White Masks, Fanon points out that the black woman
who seeks a child by a white man is engaging in identification with the
oppressor. By associating with the white man, she in some sense
becomes white obtaining legitimacy and power from this
identification. She is thus alienated from herself and attempts to

escape her own blackness by becoming the concubine of the white
master.
Calvin Hernton in Sex and Racism in America makes some of the
same points. But what do we find in Miss Greer's statements? She
obviously seeks identification with the oppressed through the black
man's oppression and the oppression that she and her child would
receive. The implications of this particular form of identification with
the downtrodden are threefold.
Firstly, it displays the fact that Miss Greer does not really feel
oppressed as a white woman or at least not as oppressed as black
Americans are and as her fervent wish is to be oppressed, what better
way to that end than by becoming black? Secondly, her statement
concerning her own preference for brown over white uncovers a basic
alienation from herself, not as a woman per se but from her whiteness

the white male decision-makers. Her image of the ironic confrontation
between black policemen and women in front of the Pentagon is an
extremely striking portrayal of the oppressed destroying the
oppressed.
Although these sentiments appear quite laudatory superficially, 1
have an acute and actual rather than a vague sense of uneasiness as to
exactly where Germaine Greer's revolutionary fervor has its psychic
source, particularly with regard to racism, sexism and blackness in
America.
This feeling finds an empirical foundation in a quotation from Miss
Greer which appeared in a recent issue of Jet magazine and which she
repeated at last Thursday's noon rally (which in reality and despite
Miss Greer's protestations may be seen as an advertising gimmick, the
hip revolutionary's equivalent of an author autograph party, both
rally and party being primarily designed to give public exposure to the
author in order to increase book sales).
The quotation by Miss Greer is, "I would rather have a child by a
black man than a white man;" she further elaborated on this
statement Thursday giving some deference to the legitimacy of the
black woman's angry response to such a position and expressing a
desire to be worthy of sisterhood with her black counterpart.
Her explanation was that a white woman's giving birth to a black
child in this society "niggerizes" (Miss Greer's term) both the child
and the mother thus making the white mother in some sense black
and providing an entry into the black experience. Miss Greer went on
to note that actually she preferred being brown to being white.
What we have in Miss Greer seems to be a living example of Frantz
Fanon's explanatory analysis of miscegenation turned on its head. In
Black Skins, White Masks, Fanon points out that the black woman
who seeks a child by a white man is engaging in identification with the
oppressor. By associating with the white man, she in some sense
becomes white obtaining legitimacy and power from this
identification. She is thus alienated from herself and attempts to

escape her own blackness by becoming the concubine of the white
master.
Calvin Hernton in Sex and Racism in America makes some of the
same points. But what do we find in Miss Greer's statements? She
obviously seeks identification with the oppressed through the black
man's oppression and the oppression that she and her child would
receive. The implications of this particular form of identification with
the downtrodden are threefold.
Firstly, it displays the fact that Miss Greer does not really feel
oppressed as a white woman or at least not as oppressed as black
Americans are and as her fervent wish is to be oppressed, what better
way to that end than by becoming black? Secondly, her statement
concerning her own preference for brown over white uncovers a basic
alienation from herself, not as a woman per se but from her whiteness
and its manifestation in her past role as Ultrafeminine Doll.
Finally is it not possible that such self-alienation and identification
with blacks produces in Miss Greer the incarnation of Lula, the white
woman of Baraka's (Leßoi Jones) Dutchman, who seeks to suck the
vitality and essence which she has forfeited for the pleasures of
capitalistic materialism from the black man, in the play represented
by Clay?
I have not contended that women are not oppressed in this society
because I firmly believe that they are. However their oppression is not
the same nor is it as intense as that of the black individual in this
society. There exists a pleasurable and comfortable role for the white
woman in the society as the Ultrafeminine Doll if she chooses to opt
for it.
The psychic damage to a woman's self-image is of a totally
different nature than the constant economic and physical oppression
of blacks who have no role option, no physically comfortable
alternative to retreat to if the going gets too rough. Miss Greer thus
does not and cannot feel as oppressed as a black without becoming
one; she retains a sense of guilt for being white and for not being as
oppressed as she wished she were.
The miscegenated relationship (blackman, white woman; white
man, black woman) in modern society is a tenuous and strained one,
compromised by untold pressures from both racial groups, black and
white, as well as difficulties in the individual psychic constructs and
motivations of the two persons involved. Although an extremely rare
occurence in this society, a successful interracial relationship is
transcendent; it requires two exceptionally mature people, both
having a sympathetic understanding as well as a deep emotional
feeling for the other, in addition to a strong, stable sense of self by
which I mean the recognition of who one is, where one comes from
and what one believes.
Needless to say Miss Greer's self-alienation does not provide a
foundation for such a transcendent relationship: in fact she wishes,
once again, to use the black man to reach her own egocentric ends -
that is obtaining a complete feeling of oppression which she now
lacks.
Finally Miss Greer is totally correct in her cry for the destruction
of our present system but she must recognize that sexism and racism
are not the same thing and that the oppression due to the former pales
in comparison with the letter.
To move forward with the humanization of modern man we do not
need these useless attempts to who and what one is and can be. Only
when this is clearly recognized and obtained can we hope to find
legitimate steps toward change and coming together.

The power and potency of the thought of Germaine Greer lies in
her ability to move beyond the ordinary rhetoric about liberating
women in this culture and society from their humdrum, mindless
existence and sexual exploitation, to more profound concerns for the
liberation of all humans from the brutalization of this system.
The woman has a powerful tool, her feminity, with which to effect
the radical humanization of modern man. Miss Greer seeks an atypical
revolution; a revolution which rather than replacing one powerful elite
with another, will do away with power completely. To effect such a
change, she implies that a combination of all oppressed peoples into a
revolutionary front is necessary.
At the very least such revolutionary movements should not
dissipate essential energy through in-fighting, the result of which can
only be the weakening of such movements and the strengthening of
the white male decision-makers. Her image of the ironic confrontation
between black policemen and women in front of the Pentagon is an
extremely striking portrayal of the oppressed destroying the
oppressed.
