# Cal Editors Fired; Will Defy Board
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
Editors and staff members of the
Daily Californian, student newspaper of
U.C. Berkeley, plan to defy a
Publications Board order firing three of
the paper's five member Senior
Editorial Board (5.E.8.).
The Publications Board had voted
7-4 last night to punish the student
editors for their front-page editorial last
Tuesday which advocated the retaking
of People's Park.
Fired were David Dozier, Editorial
Page Editor; James Glodgett, Managing
Editor; and Fran Hawthorne, Lower
Staff Representative. Editor-in-Chief
John Emshwiller and City Editor Trish
Hall, remaining members of the S.E.B.
promptly resigned in protest.
Several members of the lower staff
submitted their resignations, although
Emshwiller requested that junior
personnel remain at work for the
security of the paper.
Denying Authority
A subsequent meeting of the entire
staff voted to deny the authority of the
Publications Board over the paper. A
spokeswoman for the Daily Cal
indicated that, "We will publish
independently of them, for as long as
possible. We won't quit working until
we're physically stopped." All members
of the staff, including those fired, will
continue to work.
The paper has been working towards
independent status, by 1972. It
currently receives some funding and
office space from the University.
Under the terms of a resolution
sponsored last year by Regent John S.
Canaday, the paper will lose these and
its on-campus newstands if published
independently.
The Publishing Board was acting on
a resolution by the Chancellor's
representative, Public Information
Officer Richard Hafner. The resolution
charged the three editors with
"irresponsible and immature action."
The editorial urged readers to
"retake the Park" to mark the second
anniversary of Bloody Thursday, when
James Rector was killed and another
student blinded.
It was not explicit in its directions,
but it did suggest donations of dope,
food, wine, or wire-cutters to an effort
to "take it back in the same spirit as it
was first taken - with joy and
spontaneity and dedication."

Later editorials toned down the
original stance, with a unanimous
editorial on Friday urging a dedication
of the park with a spirit of nonviolence.
A number of Daily Cal staff
members attended the Saturday rally,
urging demonstrators to remain
nonviolent. Nonetheless, demonstrators
did attempt to tear down the fence
surrounding the park, and were routed
by police using tear gas and nonlethal
ricochet bullets. Forty-four persons
were arrested by Berkeley police.
Regents Upset
Action on the editorial is not likely
to be limited to the Publishing Board.
Regent Canaday has requested that the
matter by put on the agenda for the
Regents' meeting to be held tomorrow
in San Francisco.
Governor Ronald Reagan, ex-office
member of the Board of Regents has
indicated that the question will arise
during the Regents' Friday meeting. He
noted that the editorial will not be the
only item for discussion. "Other
matters" involving "violations of
guidelines" by the student newspaper
will be discussed.
