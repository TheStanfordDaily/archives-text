# Emblems Still Sell
## 
### KAREN KAUSER DON TOLLEFSON 
Commentary
One day while shopping at the Stanford
Bookstore for Elsie Borden's "Sticky Fingers" glue,
we happened to stop at a display table near the
photo developing department. Everyone who has
been in the bookstore has probably gone by this
table on their way to some other section.
But until one really stops and explore this table
and other nearby crans and nookies, he hasn't
really seen all the incredible amount of genuine
Stanford memorabilia available at the Bookstore.
In less than 100 square feet of shelf space, a
person can find five kinds of gold-rimmed,
Stanford-emblemmed glasses, six kinds of bookends,
three sizes of photo albums, nine kinds of ashtrays,
seven kinds of key rings and around 12 or so kinds
of mugs. And every item has some kind of Stanford
insignia on it.
But on another nearby shelf, hidden between
pennants and eight kinds of decals is the killer of
the entire inventory—a "three-dimensional,
multi-purpose wall placque" that functions as a
combination desk ornament, paper weight, ashtray
and wall placque and which sells for a mere $3.95.
Old German Favorite
On the inner surface of this ashtray among
ashtrays is enshrined the immortal German phrase
"Die Luft Das Freiheft Weht" or "The Air the
Freedom Blows."
Before breaking into your roomate's piggy bank
and rushing down to buy one of these placques, be
forewarned that you may get into more than you or
your wallet can handle.
For on these few shelves are found enough items
to solve all the fashion, academic and gift needs a
student might have while at Stanford.
All Stanford students at one time or another will
face two great problems—what gifts to send their
parents and how to plan their next campus card
party. But your Bookstore is here to help.
Theorizing that you run into a few academic
problems and require 18 years to earn your degree,
you could still send your parents a different
Stanford mug or ashtray each Christmas without
ever repeating yourself.
But while you are earning that degree you will
still have to worry about planning those
innumerable card parties you'll have to give. But
your Bookstore can provide you with everything
from monogrammed playing cards to napkins.
They also stock emblematic notebooks and a
fake mother of pearl and red mechanical pencil for
scoring. Red and white or blue and white "Hoover
Tower" plates and monogrammed mugs are
available for snacks. They even have smaller note
paper to use for invitations.
They don't have the food to feed the other

players, but they can help you with preparing it.
The Easy Gourmet From Stanford has recipes for
such cardplaying favorites as "Chicken Cashew
Casserole with Molded Cranberry Salad," "Velma's
Apology Pie," "Green Chili Com Bread" and
"Eggplant Caviar."
In case anyone needs to be hospitalized following
their meal, they can be kept warm with an official
Stanford blanket, the most expensive of all
emblematic items, at $2.50. Any mess left over can
be quickly cleaned up with a giant-size Stanford
beachtowel, complete with footprints.
As a surprise gift idea, you might affix a decal to
each of your guest's cars or bikes while they are
playing, eating or recuperating. Evidently quite a
few card party hosts have already been doing this.
A totally irresponsible and undependable Daily
poll taken last Saturday found that 76 out of 146
cars on campus possessed decals. The Theta Delta
Chi fraternity parking lot led all lots with a 70
percent decalled rate.
But as with all emblematic items, the decals now
being sold no longer include the caricature of the
Stanford Indian which was declared objectionable in
September. A few items with the old emblem are
still available upon request, since the bookstore has
not sold all the stock it had when the decision was
reached.
Some of the old Indian items have been sold to a
store in Oregon which uses the Indian as a mascot
and has school colors of red and white. But in
Mountain View carehouse there are still sizeable
numbers of old Indian dolls which were purchased
by the boatload from Japan.
New Indian Missing
As of yet, the new mascot, a chief or the Plains
Indians with full headress has not been used on any
emblematic items. The Stanford seal has replaced
the Indian in most instances. The change has
apparently not made much difference in total sales.
Although student tastes have changed and the
attractiveness of emblematic articles has lessened,
sales of these items along with greeting cards and
stationary account for 11 or 12 percent of total
bookstore sales. According to Kathy Stookey,
purchasing agent for the department, a large amount
of purchases are made by alumni, tourists and
students buying for their family.
"Naturally we do well around the start of the
year, Christmas and just before school gets out. On
days of football games there is also usually a lot of
business.
Although many students may consider it rah-rah
and un-cool, T-shirts and to a lesser extent,
sweatshirts are still seen frequently around campus.
When asked why they wore them students replied
with such reasons as "It was the only thing that was
clean," "My parents bought it for me the first day
that I came here, and"It covers my acne."

The following is the list of
students who will graduate with
"Great Distinction" and with
"Distinction" at Commencement
this year.
The University awards the
Bachelor's degree with "Great
Distinction" to approximately
five percent, and with
"Distinction" to approximately
fifteen percent of the graduating
class. This award is based
primarily on the work of the last
two years.
