# CLO Revives Old 'Holiday'
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Summer is approaching, ACT has folded up shop, and the San
Francisco Civic Light Opera has come to town. Light opera is a
euphemism for musical comedy, and this year the CLO will be
presenting "Candide," and "Company," in addition to an uncertain
production of "Knickerbocker Holiday," which opened last week in
the Curran Theater.
To say that "Knickerbocker Holiday" is an uncertain production
means, really, that I am uncertain about it. Presumably Maxwell
Anderson and Kurt Weill knew what they were about when they
wrote the thing in 1938, and the poeple at the CLO who are in charge
of planning repertories probably had good reasons for attempting to
revive it; and I must assume that Director Albert Marre knew what he
was doing when he cast Burt Lancaster as, of all things, Pieter
Stuyvesant.
I am sure all these poeple knew what they were doing. I just
haven't completely figured it out yet.
Transitional Play
"Knickerbocker Holiday" is a transitional play, a musical that fits
historically between the empty-headed operetta's of the twenties and
earlier, and the "modern" musical, with integrated book and music,
the original being Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oklahoma," which
opened in 1943.
If "Oklahoma" represented a revolution in musical theater,
"Knickerbocker Holiday" was equivalent to Madame Defarge taking
knitting lessons. Both writer-lyricist Maxwell Anderson and composer
Kurt Weill were serious artists. 1938 was a very grim time, with most
of the world still suffering from the economic depression, the Spanish
Civil War just winding down, the Nazis just winding up, not to
mention the Fascists in Ethiopia and the Japanese in Manchukuo, just
winding around.
Both Anderson and Weill were sensitive about the preservation of
liberty in the face of rampant oppression (that's oppression folks, not
repression; they weren't kidding in those days).
"Knickerbocker Holiday" was an attempt to deliver a political
message (Freedom is Good, Tyranny is Bad) dressed up in the vacuous
medium of the musical comedy.
The result is a strange concoction. The first act is so bad that you
have to feel sorry for the actors.
With the exception of "September Song," the melodies are among
Weill's most forgettable. The book is inane, the jokes are pallid or

archaic ("Rooseveltâ€”that's a strange name"), the characters, when not
stock charactures, are deadly bores.
Act Two Differs
Act Two is a different story altogether. It's as if Anderson and
Weill had made their concession to public taste, had their audience
hooked, and were ready to give'em the business.
The political message is mild by our standards, and probably
seemed pale even then. But for a musical to say anything at all was
unheard of in those days, and Anderson and Weill must have seemed
quite adventurous to the theater patron of 1938.
In Act Two we begin to hear the Kurt Weill of "Threepenny
Opera" and the Maxwell Anderson of "Cry the Beloved Country."
The songs bear titles such as "Our Ancient Liberties" and "Dirge For
A Soldier." The play becomes more serious, more meaningful, more
modern.
By the time it is over, you can almost forget the dreadful first act,
and you are touched by the simple, quiet finale. How much you can
enjoy this show is very much dependent on how quickly you can
forget the first hour.
The story is a very fanciful account of the coming of Governor
Pieter Stuyvesant to Nieuw Amsterdam, in 1647. Stuyvesant is a
legendary figure in New York history, a sort of a Founding Father.
He is also universally acknowledged to have been a sonofabitch,
and Anderson drew upon this image to make him into a proto-fascist,
a tyrant who replaces the corrupt but lovable regime of Dutch
burghers with an equally corrupt, steel-fisted military dictatorship.
(Because this is a musical, the new regime is only a little less lovable.)
Lancaster Sings?
Burt Lancaster, who cannot sing, is cast as Stuyvesant. Well, it was
an interesting idea, and maybe it should have worked. But it didn't.
Mr. Lancaster is certainly an excellent actor, a versatile and
commanding figure on the screen. But the night I saw the play he
seemed to be having trouble staying awake.
Whether as the Birdman of Alcatraz or as Elmer Gantry, I have
always associated him with characters of great energy and intensity. In
"Knickerbocker Holiday" he is so out of it that he has trouble
remembenng his lines.
Yet, Burt Lancaster, even when he's not in his prime, is a figure to
reckon with. He manages to make Stuyvesant a complex, sometimes
pathetic figure. His presence is so overwhelming that he steals scenes
just by being on stage. And I shall never forget his singing (?)
"September Song" ('Septembah .. . Novembah').
Professional Cast
The rest of the cast is thoroughly professional, with David Holliday
making a pleasant leading tenor, Anita Gillette a pretty soprano
ingenue, and Gino Conforti a charming and funny Councilman
Roosevelt.
The costumes are gorgeous, the dancing is inspired, and the set
clever and effective. Credit Director Albert Marre for putting it
together into one package.
"Knickerbocker Holiday" will play at the Curran Theater through
the end of June.
