# Beers Paces Team To Lead In PAC-8
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
John Beers shot a two over par
146 for 36 holes on Monday to tie
for the lead in the Pac-8 Golf
Championships at Eugene and
propel Stanford into a five stroke
advantage over the field at the
midway mark in the competition.
The defending champions
ended the first day of play with
598 strokes. Oregon held onto
second with 603, followed by
UCLA and USC with totals of 606
and 609.
Shooting rounds of 76 and 70,
Beers tied with Doug Roxburgh of
Oregon. Tom Watson carded an
opening round of 72, but faded to
a 76 in the afternoon for a total
of 148 which deadlocked him
with Craig Griswold of Oregon for
third place.
The Indian's Gary Vanier also
produced a morning round of
even par 72 but could manage
only a 79 in his second round to
put him in a tie for sixth. Pete

Harpster completed Stanford's
scoring with 153, two strokes
behind Vanier. Dennis Conrad and
Clem Richardson played for the
Cards, although their scores of
154 and 164 did not count
towards the team's score.
The bright spots for Coach Bud
Finger were the performances of
sophomore Beers and his
freshman teammate, Conrad. Both
of these golfers have played very
well under high pressure
conditions and will give strength
to future Indian teams.
Oregon, UCLA and USC are all
within range of the Cards and will
challenge for the championship.
Stanford's top ranked status inthe
southern division of the Pac-8 will
probably net the team an NCAA
invitation but a win in the
conference meet at the Eugene
Country Club would insure a bid
to the national collegiate
championships to be held at the
University of Arizona from June
21-6.
