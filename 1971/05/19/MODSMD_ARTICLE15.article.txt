# Travel To OSU
## Netters Vie For Championship 
### 
Stanford's varsity tennis team,
which finished second this year in
conference play, travels to Oregon
State early today for the Pac-8
team championships.
The Tribe, whose only season
losses came at the hands of the
defending NCAA champions from
UCLA, will face either
Washington or Oregon in their

first match on Thursday. In the
projected semi-final matches
Friday, Stanford should face USC
while UCLA should meet Cal.
Last weekend in Los Angeles,
SC came within five points of
upsetting the UCLA Bruins before
losing, 6-3. In two crucial
matches, the Trojans held match
point in the first singles and saw

their second doubles team lose
after Tom Leonard lost his serve
while serving for the match.
"Every guy on this team is
going to have to fight," said
Coach Dick Gould somberly
about the probable encounter
with Troy. "My guys really want
to play UCLA again, but we've
got to beat SC first."
Gould will go with his regular
season line-up of Roscoe Tanner,
Alex Mayer, and Rick Fisher in
the top three singles positions.
Stan Pasarell, Paul Sidone, and
Gery Groslimond fill out the
starting six. In doubles, Tanner
and Mayer will lead off, followed
by Fisher and Pasarell, and Rick
Evans and Sidone.
Coach Gould's concern is
shared by his young, loose team.
"This is the one that counts, the
only ones that matter... in the
record book," Gould concluded.
