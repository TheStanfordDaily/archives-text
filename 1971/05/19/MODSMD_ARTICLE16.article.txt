# Lacrosse All-Stars Chosen

### TOM QUINN 
After their 8-4 triumph on
Sunday over Golden Gate boosted
their record to 9-4, coach Bill
Fakland's laxmen got another bit
of encouraging news as their
season comes to a close. Butch
Hazlett, Wade Killifer, and Paul
Tittmann were named to the
Northern California Lacrosse
Association All-Star team Monday
along with midfielder Stu Childs
and goalie Fred Choate who were
names as alternates.
Hazlett who plays attack,
Killifer, a defenseman, and
midfielder Tittman will be part of
the twenty man first team that
will fourney to Los Angeles on
May 29 to play a team of
southern all-stars who lost to the
North last year. In fact, the North
willbe trying to break a precidentin
which the home team has always
been the winner throughout the
series.
Before the quintet assumes
their all-star roles, the Indians

close out their season against
undefeated Cal (Berkeley) at
Strawberry Canyon field at 1:00
p.m. this Saturday. The Bears,
who have fielded their finest team
in recent years, top the league
standings with a perfect 11-0
mark.
Stanford rests in third place
with no hope of moving up in the
standings. The Palo Alto Lacrosse
Club has a firm lock on the
second spot since its 9-1 record
gives it a two and a half game lead
over the Indians with only this
last game to be played.
The major incentive for
Stanford Saturday will be the
desire to retain the Abercrombie
and Fitch Broken Stick Award,

the symbol of victory in the
Stanford-Cal series. However, the
Indians will have to stage a major
upset to hold the trophy. Cal has
won the first game of the two
game set, 11-7 and since the
trophy goes to the team with the
highest two game composite of
goals, the Indians will have to win
big.
Commenting on the upset
possibilities, Eakland noted, "the
play at midfield will decide the
game. Cal has two all-stars, Del
Hart and Mike Weber, at this
position, and our strength just
doesn't lie there. If we can get a
good game here we might be able
to the beat the Bears."
