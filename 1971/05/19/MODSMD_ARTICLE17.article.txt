# Cards Fly To Spokane For Pacific-8 Playoffs
## 
### 
Coach Ray Young's Indians fly
to Spokane today to meet
Washington State in the first
round of the PAC-8 playoffs on
Thursday. USC plays Oregon in
the first game at 1:00 p.m.,
followed by the Stanford-WSU
confrontation at 3:00 p.m.
Young declared, "Everybody's
ready to go and prepared to take
the title. Our pitching's strong and
we have the depth to win the
three or four games in a row. In
addition, when we're away from
home, we seem to play much
better. The team has only baseball
on its mind and usually does
exceptionally as the Riverside
championship indicates."
Young isn't sure which of his
top three hurlers will be on the
mound Thursday. Dan Shaw, Bob
Kammeyer, and Bruce Schoen
who have all pitched well in the
stretch and should see action in
the tournament.
The set-up for the tournament
is double elimination. After the
four teams play on Thursday, the
two losers meet Friday morning
to eliminate one entrant and the
two winners play each other in

the afternoon. The nightcap of
the tripleheader matches the two
teams with one loss. The final
game on Saturday matches the
two time winner with the winner
of Friday's last game.
The champion of the PAC-8
then enters the District 8 regionals
on May 28-29 from which the
winner goes on to the College
World Series in Omaha, Nebraska,
June 7-12.
Stanford will need every bit of
their depth to come out of the
grind with the NCAA
championship. Their victims
would probably have to include
USC, San Jose State, and Arizona
State, all teams which have beaten
the Indians at least once during
the season.
However, Young has the
number two batter in PAC-8 play,
A 1 O'Brien (.364), along with
Mike Nelson (.327), Mark Lucich
(.327), and Rod Boone (.298) to
provide him with the cannon
power in case the pitching needs
extra support. TTiis shouldn't
happen since the Indians' big four
all rank among PAC-8 leaders in
wins, E.R.A., and strikeouts.
