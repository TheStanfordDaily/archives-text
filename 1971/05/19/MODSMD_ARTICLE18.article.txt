6 Tough Cop 9 Rizzo Wins
PHILADELPHIA — Frank L. Rizzo, a self-styled "tough cop," rode the law and
order issue to a surprisingly easy victory last night for the Democratic nomination
for mayor of Philadelphia.
He defeated a young liberal congressman and a black lawyer with an avalanche
of votes that cut even into black ghettos where his enemies had tagged him as a
racist and "brutal cop."
Rizzo, who resigned as police commissioner to make the race after 28 years as
a cop, was denounced by Gov. Milton J. Shapp as the captive of the party bosses.
And Green millri Rizzo the hand-picked choice of retiring Mayor James H.J. Tate,
who could not run for a third straight term.
Rizzo described the allegations as "just smears."
North Viets Attack In Laos
SAIGON — The North Vietnamese are on a rampage in southern Laos, almost
wiping out one town with a barrage, ambushing troops fleeing the town and
sending rockets into a city on the Mekong River.
American dependents yesterday were taken out of Pakse, on the Mekong River
near Bolovens Plateau, which was overrun Sunday by the North Vietnamese,
giving them control of strategic roads.
On the even of the 81st anniversary of the birth of Ho Chi Minh, North
Vietnamese troops appeared on the move in much of the landlocked kingdom

possibly in a drive to expand the Ho Chi Minh supply trail to the west.
The North Vietnamese also could be trying to pressure the Laotian government
in v ientiane into accepting the latest demand of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao.
The Pathet Lao last week called for a halt of all U.S. bombing in Laos as a
precondition for a cease-fire.
Whatever the objective, North Vietnamese forces followed up their capture of
two government towns in the Bolovens Plateau Sunday with attacks at several
points in other parts of Laos.
Poll Says 4 Out Now 9
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Poll reported that a survey on administration
Vietnam policies indicated 70 percent of Californians favor removal of all
American ground troops by the end of this year.
The poll, operated by Mervin Field, found that 59 percent strongly favored a
quick pullout even if the rest of the world viewed it as a military and political
defeat, and 18 percent agreed somewhat.
On the straight proposition of a pullout by year's end, it said 50 percent were
strongly in favor and 20 percent agreed somewhat.
On other questions, Field reported that 16 percent felt strongly and 10 percent
moderately that losing the war must be avoided at all cost, while 60 percent
disagreed.
He said 39 percent agreed strongly and 30 percent to some degree that they
found it hard to believe the administration was "giving us the whole story" on
Vietnam.

North Viets Attack In Laos
SAIGON — The North Vietnamese are on a rampage in southern Laos, almost
wiping out one town with a barrage, ambushing troops fleeing the town and
sending rockets into a city on the Mekong River.
American dependents yesterday were taken out of Pakse, on the Mekong River
near Bolovens Plateau, which was overrun Sunday by the North Vietnamese,
giving them control of strategic roads.
On the even of the 81st anniversary of the birth of Ho Chi Minh, North
Vietnamese troops appeared on the move in much of the landlocked kingdom

possibly in a drive to expand the Ho Chi Minh supply trail to the west.
The North Vietnamese also could be trying to pressure the Laotian government
in v ientiane into accepting the latest demand of the pro-Communist Pathet Lao.
The Pathet Lao last week called for a halt of all U.S. bombing in Laos as a
precondition for a cease-fire.
Whatever the objective, North Vietnamese forces followed up their capture of
two government towns in the Bolovens Plateau Sunday with attacks at several
points in other parts of Laos.
Poll Says 4 Out Now 9
SAN FRANCISCO — The California Poll reported that a survey on administration
Vietnam policies indicated 70 percent of Californians favor removal of all
American ground troops by the end of this year.
The poll, operated by Mervin Field, found that 59 percent strongly favored a
quick pullout even if the rest of the world viewed it as a military and political
defeat, and 18 percent agreed somewhat.
On the straight proposition of a pullout by year's end, it said 50 percent were
strongly in favor and 20 percent agreed somewhat.
On other questions, Field reported that 16 percent felt strongly and 10 percent
moderately that losing the war must be avoided at all cost, while 60 percent
disagreed.
He said 39 percent agreed strongly and 30 percent to some degree that they
found it hard to believe the administration was "giving us the whole story" on
Vietnam.
