# BSU Schedules Rally; Vote Ends
## 
### 
A noon rally will be held today on White Plaza to
commemorate the birthday of Malcolm X. Willie Newberry,
chairman of the Black Student Union, will speak. Tapes of
Malcolm's speeches will also be played.
Another activity of the BSU's week-long convocation,
the community plebiscite on institutional racism, concludes
today.
The plebiscite, which is meant to be a first step towards
eliminating institutional racism at Stanford, has received a
moderate to light turnout of voters during the past two
days. The polls will be open today from 10:00 to 4:00 at
Encina, Tresidder, the Post Office, Medical School and
Engineering Corner of the Quad.
The results will be announced next Monday as a
culmination of the BSU convocation activities which began
last week.
The first of two resolutions on the plebiscite asking for a
yes or no vote reads in part, "Be it highly resolved that the
Stanford community abhors the racism and imperialism

inherent in the institution, Stanford . . .
"Be it further resolved that the implementation of the
demands presented by the black community is the
necessary first step toward ending racist inequities inherent
in the institution Stanford."
Two of the black demands are that student admissions
be 12 and one-half percent black, with necessary financial
aid by fall 1972, and that Stanford establish and fund an
"institute for black studies."
Part of the second resolution reads, "Whereas previous,
predominantly white attempts at institutional reform have
been accompanied by minimal penalties. . . and the recent
attempt at institutional reform led and initiated by Black
people was greeted by the most severe and repressive
measures in Stanford's history . . .
"Be it resolved that Stanford should utilize all means at
its disposal to insure that none of the Black Demand
negotiators and supporters be imprisoned, suspended or
expelled."
