# SCIRE Proposes Urban Campus To Integrate Theory, Experience
## 
### KIM McCALL 
A new "Urban Campus" program to
integrate theoretic and experiential
aspects of education has been
developed by community members
associated with the Student Center for
Innovation in Research and Education
(SCIRE).
The innovative proposal is being
released to the community this week
for support and criticism There will be
an open meeting tomorrow at 7:30
p.m. in Tresidder, room 281 for all
interested.
The program would involve 30
students and at least two professors.
According to Gail Bingham who
coordinated the development of the
program, the participants would live
together in a house in San Francisco
much as students in the Overseas
Campus program do now. They would

study subjects from fine arts to
community involvement in seminars
designed especially for the program and
would spend from 10 to 40 hours each
week in intensive involvement in
internships in fields of their interest.
The new program would increase the
depth of educational opportunity at
Stanford by allowing students to
practically explore potential careers or
new areas of interest in an academic
setting.
Through the living situation students
would have the opportunity to
exchange observations and experiences,
and when they returned to the main
campus they would bring fresh
perspectives and ideas, Bingham said.
Each session of the campus would
last two quarters and would center
around two broad themes. The themes
would serve as focusing points for the
seminars and as catalysts for discussion.
Proposed themes have included urban
planning, social problems, environment,
government, and education. Adopted as
the themes for the tentative first
session, to begin in January 1972 were
the arts and community involvement.
Intern Program
Through the volunteer internship
program, which will be arranged by the
mutual participation of the Urban
Campus, the student, and the
employer, the student is expected to
learn skills, explore questions, and
discover trends in a field of interest to
him. Ten units of credit will be granted
per quarter for this work by the SCIRE
Policy Board.
Internships for the first session
could include musician, experimental
film producer, legal aide, free clinic
work, etc. Speaking of the relation of
the student to the program, Bingham
said, "This will be more something they
use then something that is given to
them."
The program is expected to fall
under the auspices of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies and under the
credit granting power of SCIRE.
It will be administered by a full time
Director who will coordinate
internships, and act as a liaison between
the program and the University.
Housing
Ideally, the housing will be centrally

located in the city and will be run
semi-cooperatively. The house is
envisioned as a center for teaching and
community interaction.
The role of faculty will be "to
create, through seminars, a framework
through which to understand the
experiences of an internship in an
urban community," Bingham
explained. They may work in the
program for one or two quarters and
will retain the same relationship to
their departments as faculty in the
Overseas Campus program.
She said that some of the seminars
might be taught by experienced people
other than faculty as are many SWOPSI
courses. They will explore the academic
foundations from which to understand
the internship experiences. Four
courses will be offered each quarter
from which each student must chose
two.
Centering Seminars
Explaining the courses, Bingham
said they, "will serve as a cohesive
factor in bringing together both the
individual student's academic pursuits
and the varying experiences and
resulting knowledge of all the
participants." They will seek to develop
certain aspects of the themes, but the
student is not restricted to working
within one theme.
