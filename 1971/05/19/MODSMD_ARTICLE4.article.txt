# Nixon Signs Bill Ends Rail Strike
## 
### 
President Nixon signed an
emergency law last night ordering an
end to a two-day nationwide railroad
strike that stranded trainloads of
commuters and cargo and was
beginning to cripple much of American
industry.
Southern Pacific announced
Tuesday night its San Jose-San
Francisco trains carrying 11,500
commuters would resume regular
operation Wednesday morning with the
end of the strike.
Nixon acted within hours after
Congress sent him the hastily enacted
measure giving 13,000 striking railroad
signalmen a 13.5 percent wage hike and
ordering a halt to the walkout at least
until Oct. 1.
Gov. Chamberlain, president of the
striking AFL-CIO Brotherhood of
Railroad Signalmen, quickly issued a
statement saying the strike had ended.
"We are directing our members to
remove their picket lines from each
railroad and return to their regular
assignments at once," he said. "We
regret that Congress has once again felt
it necessary to intervene in a railroad
labor-management dispute. However,
we will abide by the law."
Secretary of Labor James D.
Hodgson said earlier the strikers and
500,000 other rail workers respecting
their picket lines could be back on the
job by Wednesday morning. And across
the nation railroads began calling their
employes back to work.
The retroactive wage hike covers the
16 months the signalmen have been
without a new wage agreement during
protracted negotiations under the
Railway Labor Act.

W.E. Crawford, the union's general
chairman for the Southern Pacific and
Western Pacific lines, said he was
telephoning orders to withdraw all
pickets.
He acted after being advised by
phone from the Chicago headquarters
of the Brotherhood of Railroad
Signalmen that President Nixon had
signed the emergency bill passed by
Congress ordering the strike ended.
Southern Pacific said pickets were
not withdrawn from its San Jose yards
until 9:45 p.m. and the order to call in
mid-night shift crews did not go out
until then.
The effects of the strike in
California were relatively minor. The
Southern Pacific commute run between
San Jose and San Francisco remained
idle yesterday. The California Highway
Patrol reported no special problems as
the commuters took to buses and cars.
The Post Office said that most mail
continued to move during the strike
under a contingency plan.
House Republican Leader Gerald
Ford of Michigan earlier in the day had
emerged from a White House talk with
Nixon and accused the
Democratic-controlled Congress of
dragging its feet on the strike-stopping
legislation. Congress had moved much
more quickly in the last nationwide rail
strike Dec. 10, whipping legislation
through both chambers and on to
Nixon's desk in just one day.
The latest national rail strike crisis
appeared likely to finally stir action in
Congress on Nixon's proposal for
permanent legislation to give him more
powers to deal with emergency strikes
in all transportion industries.
