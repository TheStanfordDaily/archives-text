# NLRB Rejects Bridges' Case; USE To Appeal
## 
### 
The National Labor Relations Board
Tuesday (May 18) ruled that the firing
of Sam Bridges by Stanford University
Hospital was "for reasons related to his
work performance."
The NLRB ruling came in response
to a charge filed April 7 on behalf of
Bridges by the United Stanford
Employees that he was unfairly
dismissed.
USE charged that Stanford
University Hospital "had interfered
with, restrained and coerced and finally
fired . . . Bridges in his exercise of the
rights" guaranteed by the National
Labor Relations Act.
Jim Berk president of USE, plans to
obtain a review of this action on the
grounds that the NLRB concentrated
on the issue of the firing of Bridges to
the exclusion of the lesser charges of
interfering with, restraining and

coercing Bridges' union activities.
Bridges, a Black hospital employee,
was dismissed March 19 after a few
weeks of employment at the hospital.
His dismissal was cited as a reason for a
demonstration early in April which
resulted in some 28 arrests and a
$100,000 damage at the hospital.
In letters to Berk, and to the
Stanford hospital, NLRB Regional
Director Roy O. Hoffman wrote:
"The investigation (conducted by
NLRB) disclosed insufficient evidence
to support the conclusion that Sam
Bridges was discharged in violation of
the Act. Rather, it appears that he was
terminated for reasons related to his
work performance.
"Therefore,... it is concluded that
further proceedings are not warranted.
I am therefore refusing to issue
complaint in this matter."
