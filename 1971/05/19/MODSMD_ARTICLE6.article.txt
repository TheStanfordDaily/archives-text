# UCCM Drops Hardagree
## 
### CHARLES FIELD, JR 
The governing Board of the United
Campus Christian Ministry (UCCM)
voted last night "with extreme
reluctance" to terminate the services of
self-proclaimed radical Joseph
Hardegree, one of the two UCCM
ministers.
The decision was made in response
to a $14,000 cut in the annual funds
given to UCCM by the United
Ministries in Higher Educationâ€”North
ern California, the UCCM parent body.
When UMHE voted last Saturday to
slash UCCM funds, it became evident
that either Hardegree or Richard Roe,
the other UCCM minister, would
probably be dismissed.
In a preliminary open session of the
UCCM governing Board, an audience
composed largely of Hardegree
supporters questioned the necessity of
dismissing either of the ministers. After
two hours, in which alternate
suggestions were made, the Board went
into closed session and voted to
terminate Hardegree.
No Surprise
Hardegree expressed no surprise at
the outcome. "During the meeting I
began to feel that the possibilities of a
better solution were stronger," he said.
"I still didn't feel it was likely I would
be kept on."
In a statement issued later in the
evening, the Board called for UHME to
"assume special responsibility for the
employment of the Rev. Mr. Hardegree,
within the framework of the Christian
Church, preferably in a campus

ministry under the jurisdiction of
UHME."
The statement goes on to say "the
Board stands by its earlier affirmation
of the value of ministry such as his
(Hardegree's), which deals openly and
seriously with radical political
idealogies."
Fears of Unemployment
Hardegree had earlier expressed fears
that he would not be able to find
employment in another campus
ministry because of his association with
radical causes.
In a statement made in the open
meeting, Roe asked the Board to
"choose the kind of ministry you feel
you can support. If you can't make the
choice, I urge you to maintain Joe. It's

true that I can get a job more easily
than he can." Roe said debts prevented
him from accepting a salary cut, one of
the alternative responses that had been
suggested.
Action Anticipated
Hardegree had anticipated the action
of the Board. In an interview with the
Daily earlier in the week he had
summarized his view of the situation:
"Marx and Lenin were essentially right
when they stated that religion is a
bastion of reaction. When the chips are
down, those wielding power in the
Church side with their class interests.
"They forget that the Christian
symbol is a cross, and that the number
one man in Christianity was executed
for sedition, among other things."
