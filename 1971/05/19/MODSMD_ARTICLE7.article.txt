## Israel's Expansionistic Policy 
### 
On May 14 Israel celebrated
the 23rd anniversary of its
aggression against the Palestinian
people. In our concern over
Vietnam, the American public
should not forget that the Western
belief in "might makes right" has
resulted in war in the Middle East
as well as in Southeast Asia.
The military might of Israel has
been proven in three wars. So has
its policy of expansionism. As
Bertrand Russell wrote just before
he died: "The aggression
committed by Israel must be
condemned not only because no
state has the right to annex
foreign territory, but because
every expansionism is also an
experiment to discover how much
more aggression the world will
tolerate."
The facts are clear for those
who are willing to face them. In
1922, soon after Zionists had put
pressure on Britain to enunciate
the Balfour Declaration, Palestine
has a population of 668,000
Arabs owning 98 percent of the
land, in contrast to 84,000 Jews
owning 2 percent of the land. And
in 1946, on the eve of the U.N.

partition plan and Israel's initial
aggression, the 1,237,000 Arabs
owned 92 percent of the land
while Jews numbering 608,000
owned less than 8 percent of the
lanjd.
The U.N. partition plan of
1947 was to give the Jewish state
57 percent of Palestine. To call
that justice in face of the
demographic facts is truly
hypocrisy. But without the
advantage of world pressure and
military might the Arab call for
self-determination fell on deaf
ears.
After three wars, the Israelis
control all of Palestine and parts
of Egypt, Jordan and Sgypt,
Jordan and Syria. They justify
this position as a means of
defending pre-'67 Israel - which
itself was the product of
aggression. But if this is
acceptable, what is to prevent
them from consolidating this
position and expanding still
further in a future war to
"defend" post-'67 Israel?
Israel's occupation is unlike
colonialism elsewhere in the
world. For Israel wants the land
and is quite willing to be rid of

the indigenous population. Many
impartial accounts of Red Cross
and U.N. personnel can attest to
that. Israel feels Palestinians
should resettle in Arab countries
rather than in their own
homeland. Thus Israel opens its
doors to unlimited Jewish
immigration but will allow only
token repatriation of Palestinians.
It wants "Israel to be as Jewish
as England is English" - which
leaves little room for Palestinian
Arabs who are Moslem and
Christian. If we denounce the
exclusivism that has denied
American Indians and South
African blacks their rights, then
we must not accept, or worse,
justify, that same exclusivism in
Israel.
In order to stop aggression,
injustice, and imperialism, we
must resist it wherever it exists. In
regard to the Middle East, we can
do the following:
1. Demand that Israel resettle
the refugees, relinquish occupied
territory, and enforce equality
between Jews and Arabs in Israel.
2. Show our representatives
that we oppose sending weapons
and planes to Israel to maintain
the occupation of Arab territory.

3. Oppose the Zionist
propaganda effort which seeks to
equate purely political opposition
to Israel with anti-Semitism. Such
name-calling seeks to silence all
criticism of Israel, no matter how
justified.
4. Indicate our opposition to
the de facto censorship of the
mass media about the Middle East
which prevents information that
criticizes Israel or supports the
Arabs.
Hiding the facts will not make
them go away. While a solution to
the Palestine problem will not be
easy to find or execute, one thing
must be realized. The solution
must correct the injustices done
to the Palestine Arabs if it is to
create true and lasting peace in
the Middle East.

On May 14 Israel celebrated
the 23rd anniversary of its
aggression against the Palestinian
people. In our concern over
Vietnam, the American public
should not forget that the Western
belief in "might makes right" has
resulted in war in the Middle East
as well as in Southeast Asia.
The military might of Israel has
been proven in three wars. So has
its policy of expansionism. As
Bertrand Russell wrote just before
he died: "The aggression
committed by Israel must be
condemned not only because no
state has the right to annex
foreign territory, but because
every expansionism is also an
experiment to discover how much
more aggression the world will
tolerate."
The facts are clear for those
who are willing to face them. In
1922, soon after Zionists had put
pressure on Britain to enunciate
the Balfour Declaration, Palestine
has a population of 668,000
Arabs owning 98 percent of the
land, in contrast to 84,000 Jews
owning 2 percent of the land. And
in 1946, on the eve of the U.N.

partition plan and Israel's initial
aggression, the 1,237,000 Arabs
owned 92 percent of the land
while Jews numbering 608,000
owned less than 8 percent of the
lanjd.
The U.N. partition plan of
1947 was to give the Jewish state
57 percent of Palestine. To call
that justice in face of the
demographic facts is truly
hypocrisy. But without the
advantage of world pressure and
military might the Arab call for
self-determination fell on deaf
ears.
After three wars, the Israelis
control all of Palestine and parts
of Egypt, Jordan and Sgypt,
Jordan and Syria. They justify
this position as a means of
defending pre-'67 Israel - which
itself was the product of
aggression. But if this is
acceptable, what is to prevent
them from consolidating this
position and expanding still
further in a future war to
"defend" post-'67 Israel?
Israel's occupation is unlike
colonialism elsewhere in the
world. For Israel wants the land
and is quite willing to be rid of

the indigenous population. Many
impartial accounts of Red Cross
and U.N. personnel can attest to
that. Israel feels Palestinians
should resettle in Arab countries
rather than in their own
homeland. Thus Israel opens its
doors to unlimited Jewish
immigration but will allow only
token repatriation of Palestinians.
It wants "Israel to be as Jewish
as England is English" - which
leaves little room for Palestinian
Arabs who are Moslem and
Christian. If we denounce the
exclusivism that has denied
American Indians and South
African blacks their rights, then
we must not accept, or worse,
justify, that same exclusivism in
Israel.
In order to stop aggression,
injustice, and imperialism, we
must resist it wherever it exists. In
regard to the Middle East, we can
do the following:
1. Demand that Israel resettle
the refugees, relinquish occupied
territory, and enforce equality
between Jews and Arabs in Israel.
2. Show our representatives
that we oppose sending weapons
and planes to Israel to maintain
the occupation of Arab territory.

propaganda effort which seeks to
equate purely political opposition
to Israel with anti-Semitism. Such
