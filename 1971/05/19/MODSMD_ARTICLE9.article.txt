Editor, THE DAILY:
We are disgusted by the
third-rate journalism you have
been presenting during this
academic year. The number of
pages have been reduced and the
Daily filled with ads. For
economy's sake this austerity is
understandable - but only if
justice is done to the remaining
pages of the Daily by including

only those news items and
analyses of real relevance or
concern to the Stanford
community. Unfortunately the
Daily has disappointed us.
We find a smiling king of the
"Hobos" and a trite commentary
on his life-style covering a quarter
of the front page of the Daily,
while during that same week the
Bangla Desh Committee of
Stanford had been urging the
Daily to print their appeal for
support against the massacre of
hundreds of thousand of innocent
civilians in East Pakistan
The above mentioned
committee had organized a
well-attended (approximately 250
people), informative teach-in on
Bangla Desh at the Art
Auditorium on May 13. KZSU
made a recording of the entire
proceedings. On opening a copy
of the Daily on the next day (May
14), we found one third of the
front page devoted to Miss Greer,
a women's lib prophet whose
singular proficiency seemed to be
in using obscenities (judging from
what we heard at White Plaza),
while no mention was made about
the teach-in.
What is more urgent
dramatizing the exploits of the
King of the Vagabonds or the
plight of the millions of people in
Bangla Desh? Which is more
justified - publicising the
pseudo-philosophy of Miss Greer
or the teach-in on the newest
genocide in Asia?

Editor, THE DAILY:
An Open Letter To The
Instigators Of Violence:
We, the students, of a class in
Social Protest at San Carlos High
School would like to express our
concern over the recent violence
occuring on your campus.
We feel that violence is an act
of ignorance that defeats the
purpose of protest. The bombings
and malicious destruction of
public and private property
accomplish one thing: abhorrence
of both you and vour goals.
Social protest is indeed
necessary to the survival of
democracy; but peace is even
more necessary to the survival of
mankind.
As high school students we are
particularly affected by the
senseless waste of your actions.

Due to a typocgraphical error,
several words were deleted from
the last paragraph of Steve
Langden's column, Franz Fanon
Revisited, in yesterday's Daily.
The first sentence should have
read, "To move forward with the
humanization of modern man we
do not need these useless attempts
at becoming something one is not
but an understanding and
acceptance of who and what one
is and can be."
The Daily apologizes to Mr.
Langdon and to our readers.

King of the Vagabonds or the
plight of the millions of people in
Bangla Desh? Which is more
justified - publicising the
pseudo-philosophy of Miss Greer
or the teach-in on the newest
genocide in Asia?

Editor, THE DAILY:
An Open Letter To The
Instigators Of Violence:
We, the students, of a class in
Social Protest at San Carlos High
School would like to express our
concern over the recent violence
occuring on your campus.
We feel that violence is an act
of ignorance that defeats the
purpose of protest. The bombings
and malicious destruction of
public and private property
accomplish one thing: abhorrence
of both you and vour goals.
Social protest is indeed
necessary to the survival of
democracy; but peace is even
more necessary to the survival of
mankind.
As high school students we are
particularly affected by the
senseless waste of your actions.

Due to a typocgraphical error,
several words were deleted from
the last paragraph of Steve
Langden's column, Franz Fanon
Revisited, in yesterday's Daily.
The first sentence should have
read, "To move forward with the
humanization of modern man we
do not need these useless attempts
at becoming something one is not
but an understanding and
acceptance of who and what one
is and can be."
The Daily apologizes to Mr.
Langdon and to our readers.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We are disgusted by the
third-rate journalism you have
been presenting during this
academic year. The number of
pages have been reduced and the
Daily filled with ads. For
economy's sake this austerity is
understandable - but only if
justice is done to the remaining
pages of the Daily by including

only those news items and
analyses of real relevance or
concern to the Stanford
community. Unfortunately the
Daily has disappointed us.
We find a smiling king of the
"Hobos" and a trite commentary
on his life-style covering a quarter
of the front page of the Daily,
while during that same week the
Bangla Desh Committee of
Stanford had been urging the
Daily to print their appeal for
support against the massacre of
hundreds of thousand of innocent
civilians in East Pakistan
The above mentioned
committee had organized a
well-attended (approximately 250
people), informative teach-in on
Bangla Desh at the Art
Auditorium on May 13. KZSU
made a recording of the entire
proceedings. On opening a copy
of the Daily on the next day (May
14), we found one third of the
front page devoted to Miss Greer,
a women's lib prophet whose
singular proficiency seemed to be
in using obscenities (judging from
what we heard at White Plaza),
while no mention was made about
the teach-in.
What is more urgent
dramatizing the exploits of the
King of the Vagabonds or the
plight of the millions of people in
Bangla Desh? Which is more
justified - publicising the
pseudo-philosophy of Miss Greer
or the teach-in on the newest
genocide in Asia?
