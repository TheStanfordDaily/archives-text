# White House Concedes
## Senate Vote Defeats SST 
### 
WASHINGTON - The Senate
yesterday rejected any revival of federal
subsidies for an American supersonic
transport in a vote underscoring a
concession of defeat earlier in the day
by the White House.
The defeat was the third in a row for
the project intended to put the United
States in competition with the Soviet
Union, Britain and France to fly a fleet
of faster-than-sound commercial
passenger jets.
House Republican Leader Jerry
Ford, given much credit for the House's
turn-about decision last week restoring
SST funds, said he has little doubt the
House will accept the Senate decision,
thus killing the program.
Presidential press secretary Ronald
L. Ziegler had earlier conceded defeat
in a press briefing.
Contract Problems
He said SST contractors would not
give way on demands for more
favorable contracts and that it would
now cost hundreds of millions more
dollars to continue the program than to
cancel it.
Reporting on two days of
negotiations with the SST contractors,
Ziegler placed the chief blame for the
denouncement on the Boeing Co., and
said the firm had demanded $350
million extra for the development of
new engines for the SST prototypes.
Before the demand, Ziegler said, the
White House had been confident the
total costs of restarting the program
would be less than the costs of killing
it.
He conceded the White House was
giving up all attempts to convince the
Senate to follow the lead of the House
which last week voted to convert a
$85.3 million termination fund into
revival money.
PoUs
All polls, including one by The
Associated Press, concluded SST revival
would fail decisively in the Senate.
The Senate vote may end a

decade-long battle over the project
hailed by supporters as vital to
continued American aviation-market
dominance and condemned by critics as
a grossly wasteful economic and
environmental disaster.
Sens. Alan Cranston and John V.
Tunney, California Democrats,
yesterday spurned a request from

California Gov. Ronald Reagan to
support revival of the supersonic
transport plane. Responding to a
telegram from the governor, the
senators said California and the nation
would benefit more by putting SST
money into urgent domestic programs.
They said their mail is running 4 to
1 against further SST expenditures.
