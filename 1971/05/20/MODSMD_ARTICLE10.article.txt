# New Party Plans Strategy For National Spoiler Role
## 
### DAN BRENNER 
"... all real organizing and
campaigning should be conceived
of only as how it can relate to the
spawning counter-culture groups
in different communities."
So reads the preamble of the
charter of the New Party of
California, the statewide affiliate
of New Party, a national coalition
of third party movements that
will collaborate for the 1972
elections.
The New Party will receive its
strength from many current
statewide political groups. Among
these are: Peace and Freedom
Party (Calif., R. 1.); the
Independant New Mexican Party
(N.M.); the Statehood Party
(Penn.), and the Wisconsin
Alliance Party (Wise). All of these
separate parties have qualified for
the 1972 Presidential ballot, but
New Party lacks a candidate.
This absence is intentional
Education Professor Martin
Camoy, head of the Western
States regional office explains:
"We want to orient people out of
the personality bag and into the
issue bag." The populist coalition
also rejects out of hand a
compromise with the Democratic
Party, from whom they believe,

their rank and file will flow.
The purpose of New Party,
then, is to act as an affiliative
organization through which
statewide and community third
parties can gain national
prominence. Furthermore, they
hope to a play spoiler role in
national or state contests. Carnoy
cites the presence of the Peace
and Freedom Party's spoiler
attorney general candidate in
California's 1970 elections as the
source of the Republican victory.
Hopefully, New Party would
be able to woo someone like
Ralph Nader to its ranks as a
Presidential contender. As yet, he
has refused to run. Among other
major party leaders are national
chairmen Benjamin Spock and
Gore Vidal; Paul Ehrlich, Josiah
Williams, and Mark Raskin
There are a number of
problems the party faces in trying >

to challenge the "big money,
corporate controlled" two parties.
Not being a personality party in a
nation that thrives on personality
politics, its role as "the
alternative" is somewhat
diminished. Furthermore, it is
having difficulties getting on the
ballot in all 50 states, which is its
immediate objective. In over 20
states, a party's candidate must be
listed, not just the party, as is the
case in California.
As for 1972 and the White
House sweepstakes, Carnoy says
the party will run a national
spoiler, but admits that the Party
will probably have to wait until
1976 for a real chance. In the
meantime, the plan calls for local
elections of New Party candidates
(as well as partisans like Abzug or
Dellums), registering the 18
year-old voters, and promoting a
national image as the true populist
party of the 1970'5.

The purpose of New Party,
then, is to act as an affiliative
organization through which
statewide and community third
parties can gain national
prominence. Furthermore, they
hope to a play spoiler role in
national or state contests. Carnoy
cites the presence of the Peace
and Freedom Party's spoiler
attorney general candidate in
California's 1970 elections as the
source of the Republican victory.
Hopefully, New Party would
be able to woo someone like
Ralph Nader to its ranks as a
Presidential contender. As yet, he
has refused to run. Among other
major party leaders are national
chairmen Benjamin Spock and
Gore Vidal; Paul Ehrlich, Josiah
Williams, and Mark Raskin
There are a number of
problems the party faces in trying >

to challenge the "big money,
corporate controlled" two parties.
Not being a personality party in a
nation that thrives on personality
politics, its role as "the
alternative" is somewhat
diminished. Furthermore, it is
having difficulties getting on the
ballot in all 50 states, which is its
immediate objective. In over 20
states, a party's candidate must be
listed, not just the party, as is the
case in California.
As for 1972 and the White
House sweepstakes, Carnoy says
the party will run a national
spoiler, but admits that the Party
will probably have to wait until
1976 for a real chance. In the
meantime, the plan calls for local
elections of New Party candidates
(as well as partisans like Abzug or
Dellums), registering the 18
year-old voters, and promoting a
national image as the true populist
party of the 1970'5.
"... all real organizing and
campaigning should be conceived
of only as how it can relate to the
spawning counter-culture groups
in different communities."
So reads the preamble of the
charter of the New Party of
California, the statewide affiliate
of New Party, a national coalition
of third party movements that
will collaborate for the 1972
elections.
The New Party will receive its
strength from many current
statewide political groups. Among
these are: Peace and Freedom
Party (Calif., R. 1.); the
Independant New Mexican Party
(N.M.); the Statehood Party
(Penn.), and the Wisconsin
Alliance Party (Wise). All of these
separate parties have qualified for
the 1972 Presidential ballot, but
New Party lacks a candidate.
This absence is intentional
Education Professor Martin
Camoy, head of the Western
States regional office explains:
"We want to orient people out of
the personality bag and into the
issue bag." The populist coalition
also rejects out of hand a
compromise with the Democratic
Party, from whom they believe,

their rank and file will flow.
