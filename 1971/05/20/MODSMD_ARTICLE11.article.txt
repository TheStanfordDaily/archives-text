# Summer Daily
## 
### 
Competence? Who needs
it, particularly when the sun
is warm, the wine cool, and
the evenings sultry?
Still interested? There will
be a meeting for anyone
interested in working for the
DAILY'S summer
companion, the Incomperable
SUMMER DIALY today at
2:00 p.m. in the DAILY'S
Storke Publications building
offices.
If you can't make it, call
x 4632 and leave a message
for Bob Litterman. He's been
chosen the People's
Slavemaster for the summer
quarter.
