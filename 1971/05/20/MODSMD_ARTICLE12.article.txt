WASHINGTON — President Nixon's forces scored a
decisive victory Wednesday in rejecting the first in a series
of Senate proposals to cut U.S. forces in Europe.
By an unexpectedly large margin of 63 to 26, the Senate
Gay lord Nelson, D-Wis., for a phased 50 percent cutback of
the 300,000 U.S. troops over a three-year period unless
East-West talks start promptly on the possibility of mutual
withdrawals.
The heavy vote underscored the view of White House
backers that they would be able to block all moves for a
unilateral U.S. troop reduction.
Principal target for administration forces is an
amendment to draft-extension legislation offered by the
Senate majority leader, Mike Mansfield, D-Mont. This
would reduce U.S. forces by half by the end of this year.
Slaying At Soledad
SOLEDAD — A program administrator at Soledad Prison
was stabbed fatally in the back of the head Wednesday as
he sat at his desk. Two other prison officers in the room
suffered minor injuries in overpowering two convicts and
seizing a prison made knife, officials said.
The slaying of Kenneth E. Conant, 49, was the fourth of

a Soledad official since Jan. 16, 1970 at the State's
maximum security prison.
Since Jan. 13, 1970, four black and two white prisoners
have been killed and there have been numerous nonfatal
attacks on guards and prisoners.
All those involved in the Wednesday slaying were white.
Black Sheriff Acquitted
OPELIKA, Ala. — An all white jury acquitted black Sheriff
Lucius Amerson and his black chief deputy of beating a
Negro prisoner after a jailhouse gunfight.
After 65 minutes of deliberations Wednesday, the jury
returned separate verdicts finding Amerson, 37, and Chief
Deputy Richard Coleman Jr.. 27, innocent of violating the
civil rights of the prisoner, Wilbert Dean Harris.
The two officers were indicted by a federal grand jury
after Harris complained that he was beaten and kicked after
he surrendered following the shootout in the Macon
County jail in nearby Tuskegee last Aug. 22. Harris had
been brought to the jail after being arrested on drunk
driving charges.
Amerson, who took office in January 1967 as the first
black sheriff in Alabama since Reconstruction, said after
the trial that he felt the verdict from the jury of seven men
and five women "indicated justice can prevail and did
prevail."
