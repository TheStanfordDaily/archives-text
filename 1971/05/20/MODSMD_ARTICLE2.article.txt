# 'Daily Cal' Editors Defy Recent Firings
## 
### 
The three fired editors of the Daily Californian, student newspaper at U.C.
Berkeley, continued to work yesterday in defiance of a Publishing Board order to
resign from the staff.
Other staff members supported the move, announcing in a front page editorial
that all Daily Cal personnel would remain in their positions and that the staff
would "rescind" the board's authority to control the newspaper.
"We took this action not out of concern for the editors'jobs, which were due
to expire in two weeks," they said, "but out of our commitment to good
journalism and the needs of the community."
Editorial page editor, David Dozier, one of the three fired, said, "we will
continue to put out a newspaper according to the spirit of our by-laws but we
refuse to recognize the legitimacy of the board action because of the chilling
effect on the future of newspapers."
Legal Advice
The staff has retained an attorney to study the possibility of court action to
overturn the decision.
The editors were fired for an editorial that they wrote and approved, calling for
the removal of the fence surrounding People's Park.
The Publishing Board held a special meeting yesterday afternoon to consider
the challenge to its authority. It adjourned without acting on a motion by
Chancellor's representative, Public Information Officer Richard Hafner, which
would have ordered editor-in-chief John Emshwiller to come up with a plan for
the continued operation of the paper "within the by-laws of the Publisher's
Board."
They plan to meet again tomorrow, and will most likely consider the motion
once again. Members of the Daily Cal staff speculate that it might attempt to
order the paper to suspend publication.
The University of California Board of Regents is expected to discuss the matter
either tomorrow or Friday at its meeting in San Francisco. Regent John S. Canday
has indicated that he may introduce a resolution demanding that the
administration fire the editors.
Governor Reagan has also indicated that he would like to discuss the editorial
and other matters pertaining to the Daily Cal.
