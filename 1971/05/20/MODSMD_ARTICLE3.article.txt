# ASSU Senate Committee Holds Hearing On Union
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
A committee of the ASSU Senate
began hearings last night to investigate
the managerial efficiency and
employment practices of Tresidder
Union. After a second hearing tonight,
they plan to prepare a report of their
findings for the next meeting of the
Board of Trustees.
A number of Food Service and
Coffee House employees cited unfair
pay scales, poor supervision and
planning by their superiors, and lack of
adequate staff during times of heavy
business in giving their observations of
how Tresidder is run.
The impetus for the investigation
came from ASSU president Doug
McHenry who wrote a letter on April
23 to President Lyman, requesting a
clear-cut reply to questions he had on
complaints about Tresidder policy.
McHenry asked how new employees
were advised of their rights to a
grievance procedure, and whether any
grievances had been filed at Tresidder
in past years. In addition the letter
requested to know what accounting
methods were used to determine the
price policy for food sold there.
Reply Made
A reply was prepared by Tregea for
Lyman, and forwarded to the
investigating committee, run by student
senators Scott Burke and Travis
Hudson. It claims that a text of the
grievance procedures is given to new
full-time employees.
It adds that food pricing is done in
such a way to provide competitive
prices with eating places and cafeterias
in the general area of Stanford.
Tresidder has come under increasing
attention not only because of the
layoff of 12 workers at the end of last
quarter, but also because this year it
required $110,000 of support from the
University and will request $160,000
for next year.
ASSU senators Scott Burke and
Travis Hudson, who conducted the
hearings, heard testimony from
Tresidder employees saying that they
were not informed of grievance
procedures and did not know of others
who had been. Workers are supposed to
have the right to a hearing if they are
fired, and to be able to formally protest
conditions on the job.
Witnesses
Asked to testify were a one-time
co-manager of the Coffee House and
ex-student, a part-time student
employee at the Food Service, and two
former part-time student employees
among others.
Several of the allegations appear to

be in violation of present University
employment policy. Craige McKnight,
the former co-manager of the Coffee
House said most full-time workers there
were classified as "Food Service I",
indicating they performed unskilled,
supervised work.
McKnight, now a regular employee
at the Coffee House, contended that
work was rarely performed under
managerial supervision. Also, it
required a moderate amount of skill
and experience entitling employees to a
"Food Service 11" classification with
better pay.
A fire warning system was lacking in
the Coffee House added McKnight,
citing an occasion where a Stanford
policeman walked in to find the place
full, while an alarm was ringing in
Tresidder itself.

He added that Rafeal Henao, a
business student who manages the
Coffee House presently, employs his
wife there which committee members
felt was unwarranted under University
employment practices.
Job descriptions are lacking for new
employees in many cases, said Mike
McConnell, a part-time student worker
with three years experience at
Tresidder. In addition, on-the-job
training for them is often haphazard
and places a great burden on those who
work there already, he claimed.
Chris Hocker, an editor of the Arena
suggested franchising parts of Tresidder
to private concerns, such as a discount
record store, in order to increase its
revenue. He added that as it is
managed, "Tresidder can't change,
doesn't change, and can't improve."
