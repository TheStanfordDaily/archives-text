# Student Report Urges Transport Changes
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL 
Christopher Lovelock, a Ph.D.
candidate in business, yesterday
recommended that the ratio of
commuter autos to commuters on
campus be reduced by 50 percent in
the next five years as a step to save the
University over a million dollars in
transportation related costs.
The recommendation came at a
public presentation at the business
school on Bay Area Transportation by
Lovelock and members of his SWOPSI
seminar on Transportation in the Bay
Area.
The presentation began with an
assessment of the present campus
situation. There are currently 10,234
off street parking spaces and 1678 on
street spaces. About 2,600 spaces are
located in the sites of planned buildings
and will have to be replaced when they
are built. New parking spaces cost
$400-450 per space. At present, most
of those parking spaces are used by
commuters to campus. A recent survey
taken between Arboretum Road and
Campus Drive indicates that 61 percent
of commuters drive to campus alone as
compared to a mere 5 percent who
bicycle.
Buzz Battle, a freshman member of
the class, explained that the total net
cost of the University for 1969-70 for
vehicles on campus was $101,307.00.

This figure includes the revenues which
are received from student registrations
of vehicles ($33,995) and the revenue
gained from parking tickets ($11,272),
and underestimates of the amoung of
money spent for new roads, parking
lots, and other capital costs.
Battle noted that in a survey of 38
schools that most schools charged as
much or more than Stanford's $10 per
year student fee, and many of the
schools charge their staff, something
which Stanford does not do. There are
10,262 faculty and staff cars registered
as opposed to the 3,752 student cars
registered.
The main plan of action proposed
by the class includes a two pronged
attack on automobile transportation
which will make automobiles less
desirable and make other alternatives
more available and desirable. The
University Planning Office has plans to
move traffic away from the center of
campus by moving Campus Drive out
to Junipero Serra Blvd. and Mayfield
Avenue so it circumvents the campus.
Parking lots will also be moved away
from the campus center.
The class recommends a raise in
registration fees to $20 for the
1971-1972 academic year with a
subsequent $5 increase each year until
1975 when the fee will be $40 to all
students, faculty, and staff.
Motor Vehicle Registration and
Parking Recommendations include
assigning all resident students spaces
next September and charge visitors for
parking. Fine enforcement should be
more stringent with a rise from $2 to
$3 for citations. The University should
consider the use of part of the
Shopping center parking lot with a
shuttle service and should encourage
car pooling among faculty and staff.
The recommendations also contain a
myriad of suggestions for extending
and improving bicycle paths and access
roads. Better locking facilities at
dormitories and a possible one time
mandatory registration are also
proposed.
