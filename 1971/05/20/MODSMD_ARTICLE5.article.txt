# William Leland: Stands Up For What He Believes
## 
### PEGGY SONNENSCHEIN 
"I consider myself relatively apolitical," says
Associate Dean of Students Bill Leland. "I stand up
in personal ways for the things in which I believe. I
try to do that in everything I do."
Five weeks ago, Leland — along with 13 other
people — stood blocking the entrance to Berkeley
draft board. He was promptly arrested, and later
spent five days in Santa Rita prison. Prior to the
Berkeley demonstration, the bearded young
administrator participated in similar protests in front
of the San Mateo draft board. However, police
steadfastly refused to move in and make arrests at
those demonstrations.
Leland admits that he is "astounded" that he was
not arrested in front of the San Mateo draft board.
He saw the situation as a "wonderful opportunity" to
talk with the 150-180 persons who were not
permitted to enter the offices.
Arrest "Consistent"
Leland does not believe his political activities
affect his position as Associate Dean. He views his
arrest as "consistent with other things I do."
Three years ago, Leland was a draft counselor
here, and last year he served as Associate Dean in
charge of residences.
In his current status, Leland is primarily involved
with counseling students on a personal basis. Among
his other responsibilities are serving as a goodwill
representative" to visitors to Stanford, initiating
proposals for student services, and holding counseling
seminars with resident assistants.
With an air of relaxed warning Leland says he feels
"far more comfortable being out of a position of

power." One of his basic principles is that "people
ought to have maximum control over their own
lives." He finds that institutions, such as schools and
governments, often interfere with this goal. Leland
believes that people turn over control of their lives to
these institutions, and as a consequence are used by
those in positions of po
those in positions of power.
Whole Other Trip
Asked about his experiences in Santa Rita, Leland
smiled and said, "It was a whole other trip." It was,
he said, "an awful, horrible thing to experience or
observe." He regards his own experiences as
irrelevant. What concerns him is the overall prison
situation. "One thing that was very clear was the
socio-economic implications. It was irrelevant what
we were in for. What was important was that we were
white." Leland felt that he and his companion, the
only whites in their barracks were "able to receive
some support and receive some respect from the
blacks..." He stressed that he found the attitude of
resentment among the prisoners "very
understandable," and was concerned with the guards
attitude of condescension.
"The general feeling is that six to nine months in
Santa Rita is equivalent to about two years in San
Quentin. It's strictly negative, punitive. They reduce
prisoners to a childlike, dependent existence. In a
way, it is a gross absurdity which, in my mind, can
have no possible justification," he said.
However, Iceland was not deterred by his recent
experiences. "I in no way regret what I've
done . . . even knowing now the discomfort and
horror or prison, I'm certain that I will have to engage

in some kind of civil disobedience in the future." He
paused and added, "I don't look forward to it."
Personal Conviction
Bill Leland is a man who acts strictly out of strong
personal conviction and is relatively uninfluenced by
external pressures. Although he hopes that his recent
activities will increase public awareness about the
draft, the deeper motive for his actions was personal
commitment.
"We all try to decrease the discrepancy between
what we say and do. This doesn't mean all 1 do is
consonant with what I say, but it's one way of
moving in a direction of being more honest with
myself."
Although he vehpmently opposes the draft, Leland
does not consider himself a proponent of an
all-volunteer army.
"People always ask, 'Well, what if no one
volunteered?' Behind this lies the gross assumption
that somehow you have to wage war. There are other
ways of doing things besides killing people . . . My
hope is that someday, no matter how much they're
willing to pay, people won't volunteer."
Honesty and Power
Pausing reflectively, Leland discussed the
relationship of individual honesty to possession of
power.
"By the nature of an institution, when people in a
position of power are dishonest, their dishonesty is
amplified throughout the system in which they have
that power. Those who suffer are those at the bottom
of the power structure . . . this was made particularly
clear to me in terms of who was in prison."

power.
"By the nature of an institution, when people in a
position of power are dishonest, their dishonesty is
amplified throughout the system in which they have
that power. Those who suffer are those at the bottom
of the power structure . . . this was made particularly
clear to me in terms of who was in prison."

THE DEAN'S LlST—Standing in front of draft boards is only one on Associate
Dean of Students Iceland's list of activities. Leland says he doesn't feel
blocking draft boards affects his position as Associate Dean but is "consistent
with other things I do."
"I consider myself relatively apolitical," says
Associate Dean of Students Bill Leland. "I stand up
in personal ways for the things in which I believe. I
try to do that in everything I do."
Five weeks ago, Leland — along with 13 other
people — stood blocking the entrance to Berkeley
draft board. He was promptly arrested, and later
spent five days in Santa Rita prison. Prior to the
Berkeley demonstration, the bearded young
administrator participated in similar protests in front
of the San Mateo draft board. However, police
steadfastly refused to move in and make arrests at
those demonstrations.
Leland admits that he is "astounded" that he was
not arrested in front of the San Mateo draft board.
He saw the situation as a "wonderful opportunity" to
talk with the 150-180 persons who were not
permitted to enter the offices.
Arrest "Consistent"
Leland does not believe his political activities
affect his position as Associate Dean. He views his
arrest as "consistent with other things I do."
Three years ago, Leland was a draft counselor
here, and last year he served as Associate Dean in
charge of residences.
In his current status, Leland is primarily involved
with counseling students on a personal basis. Among
his other responsibilities are serving as a goodwill
representative" to visitors to Stanford, initiating
proposals for student services, and holding counseling
seminars with resident assistants.
With an air of relaxed warning Leland says he feels
"far more comfortable being out of a position of

power." One of his basic principles is that "people
ought to have maximum control over their own
lives." He finds that institutions, such as schools and
governments, often interfere with this goal. Leland
believes that people turn over control of their lives to
these institutions, and as a consequence are used by
those in positions of po
those in positions of power.
Whole Other Trip
Asked about his experiences in Santa Rita, Leland
smiled and said, "It was a whole other trip." It was,
he said, "an awful, horrible thing to experience or
observe." He regards his own experiences as
irrelevant. What concerns him is the overall prison
situation. "One thing that was very clear was the
socio-economic implications. It was irrelevant what
we were in for. What was important was that we were
white." Leland felt that he and his companion, the
only whites in their barracks were "able to receive
some support and receive some respect from the
blacks..." He stressed that he found the attitude of
resentment among the prisoners "very
understandable," and was concerned with the guards
attitude of condescension.
"The general feeling is that six to nine months in
Santa Rita is equivalent to about two years in San
Quentin. It's strictly negative, punitive. They reduce
prisoners to a childlike, dependent existence. In a
way, it is a gross absurdity which, in my mind, can
have no possible justification," he said.
However, Iceland was not deterred by his recent
experiences. "I in no way regret what I've
done . . . even knowing now the discomfort and
horror or prison, I'm certain that I will have to engage

in some kind of civil disobedience in the future." He
paused and added, "I don't look forward to it."
Personal Conviction
Bill Leland is a man who acts strictly out of strong
personal conviction and is relatively uninfluenced by
external pressures. Although he hopes that his recent
activities will increase public awareness about the
draft, the deeper motive for his actions was personal
commitment.
"We all try to decrease the discrepancy between
what we say and do. This doesn't mean all 1 do is
consonant with what I say, but it's one way of
moving in a direction of being more honest with
myself."
Although he vehpmently opposes the draft, Leland
does not consider himself a proponent of an
all-volunteer army.
"People always ask, 'Well, what if no one
volunteered?' Behind this lies the gross assumption
that somehow you have to wage war. There are other
ways of doing things besides killing people . . . My
hope is that someday, no matter how much they're
willing to pay, people won't volunteer."
