# EDITORIAL
## 
### 
Last week, the Daily Californian, U.C.
Berkeley's student newspaper, invited its
readers to a party at People's Park. The
festivities were scheduled to begin at noon
on Saturday, to commemorate the second
anniversary of a fence-the fence that
surrounds the soccer field and parking lots
that were once a community park.
In the nine days since that editorial
graced the front page of the paper, the Daily
Cal has been in the midst of controversy.
Despite four subsequent editorials issued to
clarify the paper's position against violence,
a riot errupted at the "party."
Then on Tuesday, one week after the
original editorial had appeared, three senior
editors of the Daily Cal were fired from their
jobs by the paper's Publisher's Board. The
paper's staff took the only available course
of action -they ignored the decisions of the
Publisher's Board. In yet another editorial,
they proclaimed "We Won't Quit."
We're glad they didn't.
The obvious issue at stake is freedom of
the press. The senior editorial board of the
Daily Cal can be found guilty of, at most,
ambiguity in the writing of their
controversial editorial. True, they called for
people to "take back the park," and
suggested someone bring some wirecutters,
but they continued by reminding their
readers that the liberation of People's Park
must be done nonviolently.
The editors' continued pleas throughout
the week to "keep things cool" apparently
went unnoticed by the Publisher's Board, a's
did the fact that all five members of the
senior editorial board acted as monitors

trying to calm the crowd Saturday.
It appears that the agents of the same
authority that successfully built a fence
around People's Park two years ago are now
determined to fence in the free press. While
only three of the five editors were fired with
the lower staff remaining intact,
nevertheless, this kind of control threatens
the editorial integrity of the paper—without
which no paper can survive.
The University Regents, many of
whom-noteably Governor Reagan and John
S. Canady-have been outspoken in their
opposition to the political stance of the
Daily Cal and other U.C. newspapers, will
discuss this decision in their meeting today.
Although it is already fairly clear what
further action the Board of Regents will
take, endorsement of Monday's Publisher's
Board decision can only be viewed as
another attempt on their part to dictate
what a U.C. campus newspaper may and
may not print.
The 11-member Publisher's Board also
meeting again today, must reconsider their
decision and hopefully find agreement with
the four students on their board who
opposed the firings.
No one has yet proved a connection
between the Tuesday editorial and the
violence on Saturday. No one ever can. The
Regents must not tamper with the freedom
of the press, and the Publisher's Board must
re-evaluate their stand. Politicians and
political appointees are not the legitimate
guardians of press responsibility.
The Daily Californian has always served
its readers well. We commend the Daily Cal's
stand and fervently hope this will not be its
last. POWER TO THE PRESS!

ambiguity in the writing of their
controversial editorial. True, they called for
people to "take back the park," and
suggested someone bring some wirecutters,
but they continued by reminding their
readers that the liberation of People's Park
must be done nonviolently.
The editors' continued pleas throughout
the week to "keep things cool" apparently
went unnoticed by the Publisher's Board, a's
did the fact that all five members of the
senior editorial board acted as monitors

trying to calm the crowd Saturday.
It appears that the agents of the same
authority that successfully built a fence
around People's Park two years ago are now
determined to fence in the free press. While
only three of the five editors were fired with
the lower staff remaining intact,
nevertheless, this kind of control threatens
the editorial integrity of the paper—without
which no paper can survive.
The University Regents, many of
whom-noteably Governor Reagan and John
S. Canady-have been outspoken in their
opposition to the political stance of the
Daily Cal and other U.C. newspapers, will
discuss this decision in their meeting today.
Although it is already fairly clear what
further action the Board of Regents will
take, endorsement of Monday's Publisher's
Board decision can only be viewed as
another attempt on their part to dictate
what a U.C. campus newspaper may and
may not print.
The 11-member Publisher's Board also
meeting again today, must reconsider their
decision and hopefully find agreement with
the four students on their board who
opposed the firings.
No one has yet proved a connection
between the Tuesday editorial and the
violence on Saturday. No one ever can. The
Regents must not tamper with the freedom
of the press, and the Publisher's Board must
re-evaluate their stand. Politicians and
political appointees are not the legitimate
guardians of press responsibility.
The Daily Californian has always served
its readers well. We commend the Daily Cal's
stand and fervently hope this will not be its
last. POWER TO THE PRESS!
Last week, the Daily Californian, U.C.
Berkeley's student newspaper, invited its
readers to a party at People's Park. The
festivities were scheduled to begin at noon
on Saturday, to commemorate the second
anniversary of a fence-the fence that
surrounds the soccer field and parking lots
that were once a community park.
In the nine days since that editorial
graced the front page of the paper, the Daily
Cal has been in the midst of controversy.
Despite four subsequent editorials issued to
clarify the paper's position against violence,
a riot errupted at the "party."
Then on Tuesday, one week after the
original editorial had appeared, three senior
editors of the Daily Cal were fired from their
jobs by the paper's Publisher's Board. The
paper's staff took the only available course
of action -they ignored the decisions of the
Publisher's Board. In yet another editorial,
they proclaimed "We Won't Quit."
We're glad they didn't.
The obvious issue at stake is freedom of
the press. The senior editorial board of the
Daily Cal can be found guilty of, at most,
ambiguity in the writing of their
controversial editorial. True, they called for
people to "take back the park," and
suggested someone bring some wirecutters,
but they continued by reminding their
readers that the liberation of People's Park
must be done nonviolently.
