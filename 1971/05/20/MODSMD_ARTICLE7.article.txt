Editor, THE DAILY:
Apropos the Board of Trustees'
decision in respect of the
"Campaign G.M.," the organizers
of the movement to force
American industrial corporations
to leave the Republic of South

Africa either show the most
callous disregard for the
well-being of the Africans, of that
country or they have been
seriously misinformed about the
facts.
The fact is, I believe, that the
organizers know the truth while
their supporters have been
hoodwinked by slanted reporting.
I charge virtually all the American
press, apart from the Christian
Science Monitor, of serious
factual distortion.
The greatest hope for the
South African non-Whites lies in
an acceleration of the present
clearly observable transition away
from an Apartheid founded on
domination by the Whites, to
"Separate Development" with
"Separate Representation,"
accompanied by official
encouragement of mutual respect
and consideration for people of all
races.
The speed of this transition
will be increased the more rapidly
the present South African
prosperity is fed by outside
capital; for the most significant
relaxations of the time-honored
injustices of the regime have been
brought about through attempts
to overcome an acute labor
shortage, which has been steadily
growing in intensity. The South
Africans are groping towards a
peaceful solution of the problem
of race relations.
Their leaders are handicapped
by a deeply religious, white
proletariat, indoctrinated by their
church with notions of the
inherent inferiority of non-white
races. But their leaders (political
and spiritual) have achieved what
I regard as fantastic changes in
electoral opinion. For instance,
those Afrikaner politicians who
clong to the 1947 outlook on
Apartheid (the "Verkramptes")
all lost their seats at the last
election.
Give South Africa a chance.
Informed criticism will help, but
it will not be informed in the
United States until the American
press begins to report objectively.
Unfortunately, the revolutionaries
seem to fear that the emergence
of enlightenment in South Africa,
with harmonious race relations
developing, will damage their
cause, and they are prepared to
use the non-white peoples as mere
pawns, showing contempt for
their material well-being. Any
exodus of foreign capital would,
they must know, damage the
non-Whites far more than it would
the Whites.

Editor, THE DAILY:
President Lyman, in his letter
of May 17 to the Stanford
Medical Community for Peace
stated that the difference between
individual acts of conscience and

"acts of extortion and coercion
must be made clear, and be
recognized by all concerned."
While astute in recognizing a
difference, the President neglected
to state what, in fact, makes the
two so distinct.
In the letter, Lyman defines an
act of conscience as one in which
an individual feels compelled by a
morality beyond the law to take a
symbolic stand and accept the
legal consequences. The President
considers these acts devoid of any
purpose other than the purging of
individual feelings of guilt or
complicity.
However, if the acts were
intended to change the situation
in any way, then by his definition
("aimed at forcing the institution
to grant concessions or change
policies") they would no longer
by simply acts of conscience, but
rather acts of coercion. In this
sense, any potentially effective
action is implicitly coercive.
While this fact doesn't come as
a surprise to most people,
Lyman's own words and actions
are remarkably inconsistent in this
regard. At the conclusion of SJC
Case no. 65, involving a protest at
the speech of war criminal Henry
Cabot Lodge, Lyman responded
to this issue of "effective" dissent.
On February 25 he stated that "if
by effective dissent one means
dissent that achieves some specific
object utterly regardless of the
means used to achieve it, then
this, argument if accepted, would
replace the rule of law in the
University with the rule of brute
force."
To Lyman's way of thinking,
any action which opposes
traditional interests and advocates
change necessarily appears
threatening, and in that sense
coercive. Brute force, on the other
hand, involves complete disregard
for such things as human beings,
their lives and welfare.
Brute force in this University is
a police riot, not a peaceful sit-in.
Lymam's letter, while full of
admiring rhetoric for "individual
acts of conscience," basically
reiterated his intent to suppress
by any means possible effective
dissent on this campus.

Once again the time has come
to fill A.S.S.U. Committee
positions up with interested,
qualified, and eager students. So
goes the script. The script,
unfortunately, is rarely followed,
Usually one of two things has
happened to the Committees.
Either a clique has taken over, or
the committee positions have
never been filled. Many people
have taken this to be the sign of
Stanford Apathy, that chronic
ailment of diseoncern. 1 disagree.

Students have never been
offered a chance to really make
any decisions about the policies of
Stanford University. Where there
are student positions, there are a
minimal number of seats available.
For example, seven to eight
faculty, and or administrators on
a committee with two or three
students.
In this situation one is given
the opportunity to talk until the
cows come home and watch the
votes go the other way. However,
the minute there is a crisis on
campus which relates to any of
these committees, we hear how
we have student representatives
on the committee to whom we
should address ourselves! This
happens frequently because the
committees on which students are
outnumbered decide policy which
affect a primarily the lives of
students.
This situation is deplorable to
say the least. However, it didn't
just happen. Although I don't
think it is apathy that keeps
hordes of students from applying
to committees, it was apathy that
created the kind of farcical
situation that now exists.
Not just on the part of the
student body as a whole but also
on the part of their elected
politicos. Formerly LASSU, and
now the Senate have chosen not
to set up their own committees
(and invite faculty and
administrators to serve on them).
Also, the ever infamous Council
of Presidents, formerly
President/Vice-President, up until
this time, have never taken it
upon themselves to see what's
happening and change it.
We have got to get ourselves
together and make some changes
this year. However, in order to
either increase the number of
students on existing committees
or the set up Senate alternatives,
the students have got to prove
that they're serious about what
they say.
The committees have been
reopened for applicants. All ASSU

still opened. Again we ask you,

racism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Langdon, in his article
"Franz Fanon Revisited" in
Tuesday's Daily, was somewhat
less perceptive than Germaine
Greer. It is too bad that
institutionalized racism is so little
understood that we mistake
attempts to restructure the system
for psychological perversities.
Consider that at Stanford when
you see a family on the street it is
most likely to consist of a white
mother, a white father, and white
child. Much less frequently you
will see a family with a black
mother, a black father, and a
black child. Almost never will you
see a white mother and a black
father and a black child.
This is how institutionalized
racism is maintained. Miss Greer's
statement, "I would rather have a
child by a black man than a white
man," recognizes a need to change
the structure, no matter what her
psychological motives.
I was much more impressed
with Anne Miner's statement on
the front page with regard to
discrimination against women at
Stanford, "The problem will be
getting the bodies there the rest
will follow."

President Lyman, in his letter
of May 17 to the Stanford
Medical Community for Peace
stated that the difference between
individual acts of conscience and

"acts of extortion and coercion
must be made clear, and be
recognized by all concerned."
While astute in recognizing a
difference, the President neglected
to state what, in fact, makes the
two so distinct.
In the letter, Lyman defines an
act of conscience as one in which
an individual feels compelled by a
morality beyond the law to take a
symbolic stand and accept the
legal consequences. The President
considers these acts devoid of any
purpose other than the purging of
individual feelings of guilt or
complicity.
However, if the acts were
intended to change the situation
in any way, then by his definition
("aimed at forcing the institution
to grant concessions or change
policies") they would no longer
by simply acts of conscience, but
rather acts of coercion. In this
sense, any potentially effective
action is implicitly coercive.
While this fact doesn't come as
a surprise to most people,
Lyman's own words and actions
are remarkably inconsistent in this
regard. At the conclusion of SJC
Case no. 65, involving a protest at
the speech of war criminal Henry
Cabot Lodge, Lyman responded
to this issue of "effective" dissent.
On February 25 he stated that "if
by effective dissent one means
dissent that achieves some specific
object utterly regardless of the
means used to achieve it, then
this, argument if accepted, would
replace the rule of law in the
University with the rule of brute
force."
To Lyman's way of thinking,
any action which opposes
traditional interests and advocates
change necessarily appears
threatening, and in that sense
coercive. Brute force, on the other
hand, involves complete disregard
for such things as human beings,
their lives and welfare.
Brute force in this University is

Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Langdon, in his article
"Franz Fanon Revisited" in
Tuesday's Daily, was somewhat
less perceptive than Germaine
Greer. It is too bad that
institutionalized racism is so little
understood that we mistake
attempts to restructure the system
for psychological perversities.
Consider that at Stanford when
you see a family on the street it is
most likely to consist of a white
mother, a white father, and white
child. Much less frequently you
will see a family with a black
mother, a black father, and a
black child. Almost never will you
see a white mother and a black
father and a black child.
This is how institutionalized
racism is maintained. Miss Greer's

President Lyman, in his letter
of May 17 to the Stanford
Medical Community for Peace
stated that the difference between
individual acts of conscience and

"acts of extortion and coercion
must be made clear, and be
recognized by all concerned."
While astute in recognizing a
difference, the President neglected
to state what, in fact, makes the
two so distinct.
In the letter, Lyman defines an
act of conscience as one in which
an individual feels compelled by a
morality beyond the law to take a
symbolic stand and accept the
legal consequences. The President
considers these acts devoid of any
purpose other than the purging of
individual feelings of guilt or
complicity.
However, if the acts were
intended to change the situation
in any way, then by his definition
("aimed at forcing the institution
to grant concessions or change
policies") they would no longer
by simply acts of conscience, but
rather acts of coercion. In this
sense, any potentially effective
action is implicitly coercive.
While this fact doesn't come as
a surprise to most people,
Lyman's own words and actions
are remarkably inconsistent in this
regard. At the conclusion of SJC
Case no. 65, involving a protest at
the speech of war criminal Henry
Cabot Lodge, Lyman responded
to this issue of "effective" dissent.
On February 25 he stated that "if
by effective dissent one means
dissent that achieves some specific
object utterly regardless of the
means used to achieve it, then
this, argument if accepted, would
replace the rule of law in the
University with the rule of brute
force."
To Lyman's way of thinking,
any action which opposes
traditional interests and advocates
change necessarily appears
threatening, and in that sense
coercive. Brute force, on the other
hand, involves complete disregard
for such things as human beings,
their lives and welfare.

racism
Editor, THE DAILY:
Mr. Langdon, in his article
"Franz Fanon Revisited" in
Tuesday's Daily, was somewhat
less perceptive than Germaine
Greer. It is too bad that
institutionalized racism is so little
understood that we mistake
attempts to restructure the system
for psychological perversities.
Consider that at Stanford when
you see a family on the street it is
most likely to consist of a white
mother, a white father, and white
child. Much less frequently you
will see a family with a black
mother, a black father, and a
black child. Almost never will you
see a white mother and a black
father and a black child.
This is how institutionalized
racism is maintained. Miss Greer's
statement, "I would rather have a
child by a black man than a white
man," recognizes a need to change
the structure, no matter what her
psychological motives.
I was much more impressed
with Anne Miner's statement on
the front page with regard to
discrimination against women at
Stanford, "The problem will be
getting the bodies there the rest
will follow."

south africa
Editor, THE DAILY:
Apropos the Board of Trustees'
decision in respect of the
"Campaign G.M.," the organizers
of the movement to force
American industrial corporations
to leave the Republic of South

Africa either show the most
callous disregard for the
well-being of the Africans, of that
country or they have been
seriously misinformed about the
facts.
The fact is, I believe, that the
organizers know the truth while
their supporters have been
hoodwinked by slanted reporting.
I charge virtually all the American
press, apart from the Christian
Science Monitor, of serious
factual distortion.
The greatest hope for the
South African non-Whites lies in
an acceleration of the present
clearly observable transition away
from an Apartheid founded on
domination by the Whites, to
"Separate Development" with
"Separate Representation,"
accompanied by official
encouragement of mutual respect
and consideration for people of all
races.
The speed of this transition
will be increased the more rapidly
the present South African
prosperity is fed by outside
capital; for the most significant
relaxations of the time-honored
injustices of the regime have been
brought about through attempts
to overcome an acute labor
shortage, which has been steadily
growing in intensity. The South
Africans are groping towards a
peaceful solution of the problem
of race relations.
Their leaders are handicapped
by a deeply religious, white
proletariat, indoctrinated by their
church with notions of the
inherent inferiority of non-white
races. But their leaders (political
and spiritual) have achieved what
I regard as fantastic changes in
electoral opinion. For instance,
those Afrikaner politicians who
clong to the 1947 outlook on
Apartheid (the "Verkramptes")
all lost their seats at the last
election.
Give South Africa a chance.
Informed criticism will help, but
it will not be informed in the
United States until the American
press begins to report objectively.
Unfortunately, the revolutionaries
seem to fear that the emergence
of enlightenment in South Africa,
with harmonious race relations
developing, will damage their
cause, and they are prepared to
use the non-white peoples as mere
pawns, showing contempt for
their material well-being. Any
exodus of foreign capital would,
they must know, damage the
non-Whites far more than it would
the Whites.

lyman, dissent
Editor, THE DAILY:
President Lyman, in his letter
of May 17 to the Stanford
Medical Community for Peace
stated that the difference between
individual acts of conscience and

"acts of extortion and coercion
must be made clear, and be
recognized by all concerned."
While astute in recognizing a
difference, the President neglected
to state what, in fact, makes the
two so distinct.
In the letter, Lyman defines an
act of conscience as one in which
an individual feels compelled by a
morality beyond the law to take a
symbolic stand and accept the
legal consequences. The President
considers these acts devoid of any
purpose other than the purging of
individual feelings of guilt or
complicity.
However, if the acts were
intended to change the situation
in any way, then by his definition
("aimed at forcing the institution
to grant concessions or change
policies") they would no longer
by simply acts of conscience, but
rather acts of coercion. In this
sense, any potentially effective
action is implicitly coercive.
While this fact doesn't come as
a surprise to most people,
Lyman's own words and actions
are remarkably inconsistent in this
regard. At the conclusion of SJC
Case no. 65, involving a protest at
the speech of war criminal Henry
Cabot Lodge, Lyman responded
to this issue of "effective" dissent.
On February 25 he stated that "if
by effective dissent one means
dissent that achieves some specific
object utterly regardless of the
means used to achieve it, then
this, argument if accepted, would
replace the rule of law in the
University with the rule of brute
force."
To Lyman's way of thinking,
any action which opposes
traditional interests and advocates
change necessarily appears
threatening, and in that sense
coercive. Brute force, on the other
hand, involves complete disregard
for such things as human beings,
their lives and welfare.
Brute force in this University is
a police riot, not a peaceful sit-in.
Lymam's letter, while full of
admiring rhetoric for "individual
acts of conscience," basically
reiterated his intent to suppress
by any means possible effective
dissent on this campus.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Once again the time has come
to fill A.S.S.U. Committee
positions up with interested,
qualified, and eager students. So
goes the script. The script,
unfortunately, is rarely followed,
Usually one of two things has
happened to the Committees.
Either a clique has taken over, or
the committee positions have
never been filled. Many people
have taken this to be the sign of
Stanford Apathy, that chronic
ailment of diseoncern. 1 disagree.

Students have never been
offered a chance to really make
any decisions about the policies of
Stanford University. Where there
are student positions, there are a
minimal number of seats available.
For example, seven to eight
faculty, and or administrators on
a committee with two or three
students.
In this situation one is given
the opportunity to talk until the
cows come home and watch the
votes go the other way. However,
