# Gibbons Offers Aid

The Gibbons Plan, a minority program for
promising skilled technicians already in industry, is
the only graduate level program of its kind at
Stanford.
In 1964, black and chicano students combined
accounted for less than one percent of the
approximately 1,200 students receiving
baccalaureate degrees from Stanford University. In
comparison, the population of California, which
supplies about half of the University's enrollment,
included about one million black people and one
million chicanos.
These minority group's credentials for admission
were basically indistinguishable from those of any
other 1964 Stanford graduate. All had excellent
grades from a top high school, had taken all the
college preparatory subjects, and had an impressive
list of extracurricular activities. Here they
encountered an environment in which they seemed
to feel very much at home.
Dr. James F. Gibbons, professor of electrical
engineering at Stanford (now on sabbatical) and
originator of the program, designed it as part of the
effort to respond to the needs of the community—in
particular, the socially disadvantaged—as determined
by his studies on the Study of Education at
Stanford committee. Realizing that many capable
persons of minority background have no
opportunity to attend college due to social and
familial pressures, Gibbons, with the support of Dr.
John G. Linvill, dean of the electrical engineering
school (also on sabbatical), passed through the
program University channels for acceptance by the
summer of 1969.
Admission to the program is granted to persons

who have demonstrated high technical skills in
electronics on the job. Those accepted are admitted
directly into candidacy for a master's degree.
However, studies are begun at the most basic level:
the candidate audits a summer course in algebra and
trigonometry. The candidates are then evaluated as
to their ability to complete regular Stanford course
work with a "B" average.
Those finally accepted begin the calculus series
and follow it the next year with the physics series,
completing their undergraduate requirements with
junior and senior level courses in engineering. The
units earned from these courses may later be applied
towards a bachelor's degree, but he goal of this
program is the successful completion of 45 units of
"B" average work in cohesive graduate level courses.
The entire program can be completed in five to six
years.
As a special opportunities program, Dr. Gibbons
placed the program under the jurisdiction of the
graduate schools, a move necessitated by the
university's strict regulations against any program of
undergraduate part-time study. The advantages of
this gambit are many: one) requirements for a
master's degree are less extensive and much more
flexible than those for a bachelor's degree; two) the
individual departments have primary responsibility
for admissions criteria and decisions at the graduate
level (the university has this responsibility at the
undergraduate level); three) students in the program
(whose average age is 27 and have been working for
several years) are more interested in a technical
engineering career-they can therefore better
appreciate the professional value of a master's
degree, as compared to a bachelor's degree; and
four) an industrial cooperative program allows the
student to work while taking a part-time course
load.

LASCIVIOUS LAKE LIFE—For the above age Stanford student it is disconcerting to imagine the
trauma he endures suppressing his desire to do something constructive, like play sandbox with those
kids. Instead, he must get back to rolling under the rays, chief pastime on Lake Lagunita this spring
