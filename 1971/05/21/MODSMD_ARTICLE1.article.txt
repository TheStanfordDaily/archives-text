# Final Exams Find Greater Glory

### TERRIE McDONALD 
Final exams tend to be like elementary school
flour and water graphic relief maps. They require a
certain amount of initial output, but rarely serve a
larger purpose than providing the student with a
grade and a disposal problem.
One exception to this rule was Professor Ben
Page's assignment and subsequent treatment of papers
for Political Science 131. Students in his "Democratic
Control of American Foreign Policy" course adopted
the perspective of an American expatriate advising
Premier Pham Van Dong of North Vietnam.
The assignment — prepare viable suggestions to aid
the North Vietnamese in achieving goals of stopping
the bombing in Vietnam and Laos and effecting
withdrawal of foreign troops from Vietnam,
permitting the formation of a neutralist government
in the South.
Of the 80 to 90 finals, all of which Page termed
"unusually good," Jim Newcomer, the course reader,
selected 13 as contributory material for a magazine
article on the exam topic. He plans to incorporate
two complete papers, representing major recurring
themes, using excerpts from the other exams. The final
draft will be sent to the Bay Area Institute and a
publisher will be sought through that organization.
The hypothetical situation takes place in
November 1971 when the 1972 American elections
are the focus of North Vietnamese strategy. There is a
continued presence of 150,000 American support
troops, and daily bombing of Vietnam and Laos
continues while the American people are told the war
has ended, since American casualties have fallen to
zero.
The two major strategies mapped out by students
to effect an American defeat reflected Page's personal
emphasis on public opinion as the decisive factor in
influencing non-crisis foreign policy decisions. One
approach is based on public opinion polls indicating
that Americans evaluate the cost of the war in
numbers of American dead only. The students
concentrated on tactics that would make the war
more costly to the U.S. Their premise was that a war
f ought with Asian lives would continue while a war

costing American lives would be priced into peace.
The second tack pursued by many students
assumed that with election time approaching, there
would be a number of politicians campaigning on a
platform of total troop withdrawal. The North
Vietnamese could theoretically capitalize on the
situation by having the Viet Cong appear to fade
away, by stopping terrorist attacks, and by releasing
token numbers of POW's to help make total
withdrawal a respectable stand for peace candidates.
At least one student suggested the North
Vietnamese release POWs directly to George
McGovem. The object would be a public relations job
for the benefit of the American public and the
election of a candidate who would remove American
forces.
Students did not emphasize the State Department,
the Defense Department, the C.I.A. or Congress as
being particularly influential in determining the
direction of foreign policy.
Newcomer constructed a verbal scenario dismissing
them all as ineffectual. "No one bureaucratic element
can change policy direction," he said, "but that does
leave the President. He feels the pressure when it
comes down to being elected or not being elected."
Newcomer felt the best papers dealt with the
dynamics of election politics and the means necessary
to communicate the situation to the American public
through the media. Students realized the North
Vietnamese need to do "large theatrical things in
negotiations or on the battlefield," he said. They (the
North Vietnamese) would then have to rely on
candidates to use the events to the candidates' own
advantage.
Commenting on the unusual perspective of the
exam, one student said his first reaction was to think
of reasons why particular tactics would not work.
Newcomer felt this exemplified the government
official's daily problem of formulating positive
suggestions. The student, however, recovered
sufficiently to think of some positive suggestions and
write an "A" paper.
The students, Newcomer said, apparently
approached the exam as a game situation. "They were
getting out of the American stream of values, leaving

their own context to go outside and take a look back
at the foreign policy process."
Professor Page, noting that most exams are
"wasted" said he would count the endeavor a success
if the article stemming from the papers could be
printed and "some insightful analysis reach the
public." When questioned about the possible
ramifications of such anti-American strategies
reaching print, Page pointed out that there are people
in the Pentagon doing the same thing. "And,"he said,
"if it's a suggestion that is to the other side's
advantage, the chances are the other side will already
have thought of it."
Newcomer's attitude concerning the implications
of having the exams printed differs somewhat from
Page's. He notes that an American had discussed, in
essence, the exam situation with Madame Binh's press
secretary- in Paris. "The best idea they could come up
with was Premier Pham Van Dong filming a fireside
chat for the American people. He would have to learn
15 minutes worth of English. Eighty undergraduates
came up with better ideas in the first five minutes,
and after that..."
"Students showed more than a grasp of the
material presented (in class). They demonstrated a
fair ability to go to broader situations and put in their
own ideas," he said. Some of the answers included
"good practical examples of breaking the propaganda
barrier of the American media."
When asked if he saw the potential for an
undergraduate think factory, Newcomer replied,
"Sure; "A 19 year old can contribute as much to his
society as anyone 45, but people don't generally
listen to him. They tell him to be patient and wait a
few years . . . The chances are he's going to be pretty
discouraged by 45."
Page called the exam "an attempt to involve
students in the workings of American foreign policy
in an interesting way by presenting a current
problem." Students felt that it was "a great
exam . . . better than the course."
Of those students who have been contacted for
permission to use their exams in the article, none
have refused and only one has asked to remain
anonymous.

Commenting on the unusual perspective of the
exam, one student said his first reaction was to think
of reasons why particular tactics would not work.
Newcomer felt this exemplified the government
official's daily problem of formulating positive
suggestions. The student, however, recovered
sufficiently to think of some positive suggestions and
write an "A" paper.
The students, Newcomer said, apparently
approached the exam as a game situation. "They were
getting out of the American stream of values, leaving

their own context to go outside and take a look back
at the foreign policy process."
Professor Page, noting that most exams are
"wasted" said he would count the endeavor a success
if the article stemming from the papers could be
printed and "some insightful analysis reach the
public." When questioned about the possible
ramifications of such anti-American strategies
reaching print, Page pointed out that there are people
in the Pentagon doing the same thing. "And,"he said,
"if it's a suggestion that is to the other side's
advantage, the chances are the other side will already
have thought of it."
Newcomer's attitude concerning the implications
of having the exams printed differs somewhat from
Page's. He notes that an American had discussed, in
essence, the exam situation with Madame Binh's press
secretary- in Paris. "The best idea they could come up
with was Premier Pham Van Dong filming a fireside
chat for the American people. He would have to learn
15 minutes worth of English. Eighty undergraduates
came up with better ideas in the first five minutes,
and after that..."
"Students showed more than a grasp of the
material presented (in class). They demonstrated a
fair ability to go to broader situations and put in their
own ideas," he said. Some of the answers included
"good practical examples of breaking the propaganda
barrier of the American media."
When asked if he saw the potential for an
undergraduate think factory, Newcomer replied,
"Sure; "A 19 year old can contribute as much to his
society as anyone 45, but people don't generally
listen to him. They tell him to be patient and wait a
few years . . . The chances are he's going to be pretty
discouraged by 45."
Page called the exam "an attempt to involve
students in the workings of American foreign policy
in an interesting way by presenting a current
problem." Students felt that it was "a great
exam . . . better than the course."
Of those students who have been contacted for
permission to use their exams in the article, none
have refused and only one has asked to remain
anonymous.
Final exams tend to be like elementary school
flour and water graphic relief maps. They require a
certain amount of initial output, but rarely serve a
larger purpose than providing the student with a
grade and a disposal problem.
One exception to this rule was Professor Ben
Page's assignment and subsequent treatment of papers
for Political Science 131. Students in his "Democratic
Control of American Foreign Policy" course adopted
the perspective of an American expatriate advising
Premier Pham Van Dong of North Vietnam.
The assignment — prepare viable suggestions to aid
the North Vietnamese in achieving goals of stopping
the bombing in Vietnam and Laos and effecting
withdrawal of foreign troops from Vietnam,
permitting the formation of a neutralist government
in the South.
Of the 80 to 90 finals, all of which Page termed
"unusually good," Jim Newcomer, the course reader,
selected 13 as contributory material for a magazine
article on the exam topic. He plans to incorporate
two complete papers, representing major recurring
themes, using excerpts from the other exams. The final
draft will be sent to the Bay Area Institute and a
publisher will be sought through that organization.
The hypothetical situation takes place in
November 1971 when the 1972 American elections
are the focus of North Vietnamese strategy. There is a
continued presence of 150,000 American support
troops, and daily bombing of Vietnam and Laos
continues while the American people are told the war
has ended, since American casualties have fallen to
zero.
The two major strategies mapped out by students
to effect an American defeat reflected Page's personal
emphasis on public opinion as the decisive factor in
influencing non-crisis foreign policy decisions. One
approach is based on public opinion polls indicating
that Americans evaluate the cost of the war in
numbers of American dead only. The students
concentrated on tactics that would make the war
more costly to the U.S. Their premise was that a war
f ought with Asian lives would continue while a war

costing American lives would be priced into peace.
The second tack pursued by many students
assumed that with election time approaching, there
would be a number of politicians campaigning on a
platform of total troop withdrawal. The North
Vietnamese could theoretically capitalize on the
situation by having the Viet Cong appear to fade
away, by stopping terrorist attacks, and by releasing
token numbers of POW's to help make total
withdrawal a respectable stand for peace candidates.
At least one student suggested the North
Vietnamese release POWs directly to George
McGovem. The object would be a public relations job
for the benefit of the American public and the
election of a candidate who would remove American
forces.
Students did not emphasize the State Department,
the Defense Department, the C.I.A. or Congress as
being particularly influential in determining the
direction of foreign policy.
Newcomer constructed a verbal scenario dismissing
them all as ineffectual. "No one bureaucratic element
can change policy direction," he said, "but that does
leave the President. He feels the pressure when it
comes down to being elected or not being elected."
Newcomer felt the best papers dealt with the
dynamics of election politics and the means necessary
to communicate the situation to the American public
through the media. Students realized the North
Vietnamese need to do "large theatrical things in
negotiations or on the battlefield," he said. They (the
North Vietnamese) would then have to rely on
candidates to use the events to the candidates' own
advantage.

"unusually good," Jim Newcomer, the course reader,
selected 13 as contributory material for a magazine
article on the exam topic. He plans to incorporate
two complete papers, representing major recurring
themes, using excerpts from the other exams. The final
draft will be sent to the Bay Area Institute and a
publisher will be sought through that organization.
The hypothetical situation takes place in
November 1971 when the 1972 American elections
are the focus of North Vietnamese strategy. There is a
continued presence of 150,000 American support
troops, and daily bombing of Vietnam and Laos
continues while the American people are told the war
has ended, since American casualties have fallen to
zero.
The two major strategies mapped out by students
to effect an American defeat reflected Page's personal
emphasis on public opinion as the decisive factor in
influencing non-crisis foreign policy decisions. One
approach is based on public opinion polls indicating
that Americans evaluate the cost of the war in
numbers of American dead only. The students
concentrated on tactics that would make the war
more costly to the U.S. Their premise was that a war
f ought with Asian lives would continue while a war

costing American lives would be priced into peace.
The second tack pursued by many students
assumed that with election time approaching, there
would be a number of politicians campaigning on a
platform of total troop withdrawal. The North
Vietnamese could theoretically capitalize on the
situation by having the Viet Cong appear to fade
away, by stopping terrorist attacks, and by releasing
token numbers of POW's to help make total
withdrawal a respectable stand for peace candidates.
At least one student suggested the North
Vietnamese release POWs directly to George
McGovem. The object would be a public relations job
for the benefit of the American public and the
election of a candidate who would remove American
forces.
Students did not emphasize the State Department,
the Defense Department, the C.I.A. or Congress as
being particularly influential in determining the
direction of foreign policy.
Newcomer constructed a verbal scenario dismissing
them all as ineffectual. "No one bureaucratic element
can change policy direction," he said, "but that does
leave the President. He feels the pressure when it
comes down to being elected or not being elected."
Newcomer felt the best papers dealt with the
dynamics of election politics and the means necessary
to communicate the situation to the American public
through the media. Students realized the North
Vietnamese need to do "large theatrical things in
negotiations or on the battlefield," he said. They (the
North Vietnamese) would then have to rely on
candidates to use the events to the candidates' own
advantage.
Commenting on the unusual perspective of the
exam, one student said his first reaction was to think
of reasons why particular tactics would not work.
Newcomer felt this exemplified the government
official's daily problem of formulating positive
suggestions. The student, however, recovered
sufficiently to think of some positive suggestions and
write an "A" paper.
The students, Newcomer said, apparently
approached the exam as a game situation. "They were
getting out of the American stream of values, leaving

their own context to go outside and take a look back
at the foreign policy process."
Professor Page, noting that most exams are
"wasted" said he would count the endeavor a success
if the article stemming from the papers could be
printed and "some insightful analysis reach the
public." When questioned about the possible
ramifications of such anti-American strategies
reaching print, Page pointed out that there are people
in the Pentagon doing the same thing. "And,"he said,
"if it's a suggestion that is to the other side's
advantage, the chances are the other side will already
have thought of it."
Newcomer's attitude concerning the implications
of having the exams printed differs somewhat from
Page's. He notes that an American had discussed, in
essence, the exam situation with Madame Binh's press
secretary- in Paris. "The best idea they could come up
with was Premier Pham Van Dong filming a fireside
chat for the American people. He would have to learn
15 minutes worth of English. Eighty undergraduates
came up with better ideas in the first five minutes,
and after that..."
"Students showed more than a grasp of the
material presented (in class). They demonstrated a
fair ability to go to broader situations and put in their
own ideas," he said. Some of the answers included
"good practical examples of breaking the propaganda
barrier of the American media."
When asked if he saw the potential for an
undergraduate think factory, Newcomer replied,
"Sure; "A 19 year old can contribute as much to his
society as anyone 45, but people don't generally
listen to him. They tell him to be patient and wait a
few years . . . The chances are he's going to be pretty
discouraged by 45."
Page called the exam "an attempt to involve
students in the workings of American foreign policy
in an interesting way by presenting a current
problem." Students felt that it was "a great
exam . . . better than the course."
Of those students who have been contacted for
permission to use their exams in the article, none
have refused and only one has asked to remain
anonymous.
Final exams tend to be like elementary school
flour and water graphic relief maps. They require a
certain amount of initial output, but rarely serve a
larger purpose than providing the student with a
grade and a disposal problem.
One exception to this rule was Professor Ben
Page's assignment and subsequent treatment of papers
for Political Science 131. Students in his "Democratic
Control of American Foreign Policy" course adopted
the perspective of an American expatriate advising
Premier Pham Van Dong of North Vietnam.
The assignment — prepare viable suggestions to aid
the North Vietnamese in achieving goals of stopping
the bombing in Vietnam and Laos and effecting
withdrawal of foreign troops from Vietnam,
permitting the formation of a neutralist government
in the South.
