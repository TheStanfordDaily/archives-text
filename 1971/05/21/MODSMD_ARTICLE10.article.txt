A death sentence has been approved by the
board of the United Christian Campus Ministry at
Stanford in the case of Joe Hardegree. It is a
condemnation of the life-giving message of the
gospels because it rejects the basic premise of love:
to feed the hungry, to clothe the naked, to take
care of the sick and visit the imprisoned.
By their refusal to even take care of the basic
needs of their own, Joe Hardegree, his vvife, and
family, the majority of the board members have
condemned themselves. The board blames the
higher body which initiated the problem. Such
shifting of responsibility is like Pontius Pilate who
attempted to wash his hands of any guilt related to
the judgment of getting rid of Christ, the
religious-political leader.
Pilate has been condemned for his cowardice
throughout history, but he had one redeeming
quality: he never boasted with empty piety that he
"affirmed" Christ's ministry nor did he proclaim:
"I am a practicing Christian."
Mast of Concern
The UCCM board meeting compares to many
other gatherings in which one side wears the mask
of concern while the other side negotiates for
survival. It happened in Stanford Hospital
negotiations with Drs. Wilson and Gonda; it
happens weekly in the Paris Peace talks, and
similarly with the BSU demands of reparation.
In all these instances, the people responsible at
this time for the decision-making policies dodge
behind numerous complexities: Sam Bridges
cannot be rehired because of this and that
(likewise for Bruce Franklin); the troops cannot be
pulled out of Indo-China because of something or
other; and all the BSU demands can't be met
because of certain existing priorities. Imperialism
seeps into all these decisions because it has
conditioned many of us to seek our own comfort,

our own success and our own prestige which leads
us to submit to the massive violence that brutalizes
the downtrodden peoples of the world.
Ironically, the move to cut the budget that
enables the board to remove Joe from Stanford
came the same week The Black Panther put out an
issue on "The Role of the Church and the Survival
Programs." There are concrete proposals as to how
churches can implement programs for survival and
liberation. The article by Father Earl Neil traces
the history of the Black Church in helping slaves
escape, in educating slaves to engage in acts of
rebellion.
Freedom and Passion
In the past, the Black Church had the true spirit
of freedom and passion for survival. Father Neil
urges the Church to recapture that early
leadership. Most of the UCCM members do not
seem to hear the cries of people suffering under
the weight of imperialism. They do not seem to
understand that they had an obligation to sustain
their brother in his efforts to "minister" through a
liberation struggle.
Joe Hardegree will continue to love and serve
the people because his practice has already
indicated that. His community will get stronger
and will win its liberation along with all oppressed
peoples of the world.
Those people who make the death sentences
now will be replaced by those who will implement
the basic needs of the poor. Board members and
their constituencies will continue for awhile to
repress; they will continue to issue policies which
help their self-interests. Like Herod, however, they
will be eaten away by worms and will die in their
own rotten degradation. Their acts already
produce a deadly stench.
