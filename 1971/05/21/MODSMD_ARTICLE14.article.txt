kzsu
Editor, THE DAILY:
Wednesday and Thursday of
next week (May 26 and 27) the
students of the University will
decide whether KZSU, the
Stanford community radio
station, will be able to continue
effectively its role in the
community. On those days a
special ASSU election will be held
to determine whether students
will be assessed $1.00 Autumn
Quarter to finance the operation
of KZSU. This money will be used
wholly by KZSU and no other
organization.
We at KZSU feel this step
necessary because KZSU will
receive no money from the ASSU
(there is no money to give), and
advertising revenues from the AM
portion of the station are
dwindling. If the students do not
vote to finance the station, its
operation will be very severely
impaired.
This past year we have
upgraded our Public Affairs and
News programs, aiming at
educating the community about
the issues at hand, both during
times of crisis and times of peace.
Also, our musical programming
has been brought more into line
with the likes and dislikes of the
Stanford community.
In short, we at KZSU feel that
the station is developing in a
direction beneficial to the
Stanford community. But all this
can be lost if the proper finances
are not available. By voting YES
next week you will spend only
SI.OO and you will insure that the
present trend at KZSU will
continue. We hope your decision
is to support the station and keep
KZSU on the air.

Station Manager,

staff of KZSU
unfair
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tina Swent's letter on
"Lyman, Dissent" would be a
more impressive argument had she
not attributed to me a view that I
do not hold and did not express in
the document she is discussing.
Speaking of acts of civil
disobedience undertaken with the
willingness to accept the legal
consequences, she says:"The
President considers these acts
devoid of any purpose other than
the purging of individual feelings
of guilt or complicity."
In so saying, Miss Swent is

unfair both to my position and to
the convictions and actions of the
Medical Community for Peace,
which were the subject of my
original letter. Surely they did not
block entrances to selective
service offices with no more in
mind than "purging of individual
feelings of guilt or complicity";
they intended to call attention to
the depth and force of their
objection to the draft and the war
by demonstrating their willingness
to make a personal sacrifice
themselves, and thus to have an
effect on policy.
I do not see how Miss Swent
can fail to see that, or to see the
difference between that kind of
moral pressure and "acts of
extortion and coercion." I should
have imagined that her service this
year as a member of the SJC
would have made her aware of
distinctions of this kind, and
sensitive to their importance.

assu committees
Editor, THE DAILY:
Ann Kimball's letter of May 20
is laudable in that it encourages
students to apply for vacancies on
faculty-student committees. I
strongly support her plea. In
addition to apathy on students'
part (which she cites as one reason
for the usual dearth of
applications), however, I would
add the procedures of A.S.S.U.
nominations which have often
been interminably slow. All
efforts to speed up that process
are to be commended.
I object, however, to her
statement that students who have
served on committees have "the
opportunity to talk until the cows
come home and watch the vote go
the other way."
That statement unjustifiably
distorts the operations of such
committees with several implied
generalities: 1) all students on
committees vote the same way, 2)
all faculty vote the same way, 3)
the two viewpoints are irrevocably
opposed, 4) students' opinions are
"unheeded" or "not heard" when
someone disagrees with them, 5)
only students are entitled to be
dissatisfied if they don't agree
with a decision.
I have served on many
committees with students. The
atmosphere has been congenial,
and never — not once — has a vote
split along the lines of students
versus other members. In
addition, neither students as one
constituency nor faculty as
another vote in the same way.

The notion of some kind of
monolithic, a priori, and
doctrinaire agreement between all
students or all faculty on a
committee contributes,
unfortunately, to the kind of
categorization which destroys
effective dialogue and
relationships. After all, why invite
students to a faculty committee (
or faculty to a student
committee!) if we already know
how they are going to vote?
Students who approach their
work on a committee with an
open mind and an uncommitted
vote are a great asset regardless of
how they vote; those representing
a dogma are bound to be
disappointed even with the
possibility of a vote going another
way. I strongly urge students
interested in helping with
committee work to apply.

parking
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to the article in the
Stanford Daily on May 20
proposing an increase in parking
fees in order to reduce campus
commuting by car. First, I do
believe that faculty and staff
should pay a parking fee as do
students, mainly as they are in a
better position to do so anyway
(they earn money).
Also, they represent the larger
proportion of people who drive to
campus. Thus, it is only fair that
they be charged equally, instead
of continuing the present system
whereby the poorer community
(students) are being forced to pay
for the parking spaces for the
richer community (faculty and
staff).
This change would, essentially,
eliminate the cost versus income
from fees' gap, as stated in the
aforementioned article.
Secondly, I deny the statement
that an increase in the parking fee
will reduce automobile
commuters. Those who live a
ways from campus must drive to
campus anyway, fee or no fee.
Worse, those who live on
campus will be forced to pay the
fee if they have a car, whether
they use it on campus or not. The
faculty and staff, comprising the
majority of automobile
commuters, will pay the fee
anyway, as they can easily afford
it.
Increasing the fee too much, of
course, will encourage massive
violations, as students will tend
not to pay the fee, and park on
campus anyway. This would be

undesireable and costly to the
univeristy, forcing higher fees.
I do, however, propose another
method of decreasing some
commuter driving to school.
Increase fees for parking in areas
close to the main campus,
designating them as, say, prime
parking areas.
Only the wealthy will park
there, as only they can afford the
extra cost. Meanwhile, the poorer
students can park only a little
farther away.
Students living in dorms and
student apartments still pay
regular fees for parking, and they
will be hesitant to drive closer to
campus, as they must pay a higher
fee.
Finally, once the university
gets the fee money, they are
obligated to use it for campus
roads and parking lots. The fee
should not be an extra source of
funds for general use.
This is unfair to people who
must have their car on campus or
must commute. However, there
are numerous road improvements
and needed parking facilities upon
which this money would find
justifiable use.

insincerity
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last weekend the Crow Indians
of Oklahoma had a Pow Wow at
the Polo Field featuring Indian
dances, songs costumes, and
displays
There were hundreds of
Indians participating, but very few
whites in the audience, which
included almost no students.
I question the sincerity of a
group that claims to have the
interest of minority groups at
heart, yet fails to support
anything as fascinating and
beautiful that is a part of the
heritage of us all.
