# minimal resource drain
## Return To Glass Bottles! 
### 
The Stanford community has a
size and affluence that make it a
formidable consumer. Since our
life styles make large demands
upon the resources of our
environment, it is worthwhile to
question our consumer habits and
tiieir consequences, and to seek
alternatives. Our aim should be
minimal drain on resources and
maximum reuse and recycling of
materials used.
One small, easy change can be

made now, making little demand
on our time, and placing no
financial burden on us or the
University. It is simply the
conversion of the vending
machines from bi metal soft drink
cans to returnable glass bottles,
and paper cups for higher volume
areas. The student body has had a
chance to enact such a change by
signing the petition going around
the last ten days.
Vending Machines
There are 70 vending machines
on campus with an annual volume
of 400,000 bi-metal cans. These
tin-plated steel cans with
aluminum tops are a waste; almost
all end up in the garbage. The few
"recycled" are of minimal value as
an industrial copper precipitate,
worth only $10 per ton.
Yet these destroyed cans have
to be replaced for future
consumption, thus generating new
power demands and air and water
pollution from the production
process. Moreover, the demand
for the metals to manufacture the
cans spurs American corporations
in their headlong drive to exploit
the world's natural resources, with
the resulting corporate
intervention in the case of tin into
such countries as Bolivia, Malaysia
and Thailand. Though Stanford's
consumption does not cause a
large part of these problems, it
does contribute by its
unquestioned generation of waste.
To end this irrational situation
there are two alternatives for
Stanford; one, switching to
aluminum cans or, two,
reinstalling glass bottles which will
cost 20 cents with a 5 cent return
on the bottle from a campus
collection center.
It is this latter alternative that
we the study committee of the
Stanford Community for a
Responsible Environmental Policy
(SCREP) propose for student
body consideration.
Glass Bottles
The glass bottles are re-usable
without any fundamental
recycling, needing only a washing,
which means less energy

consumption and primary and
secondary air and water pollution.
Secondly, considering that no
return system will be perfect, the
waste of glass, being primarily
sand, is less significant a waste
than is aluminum.
Finally, even the inital glass
production, compared with that
of cans, demands less energy, less
resources and produces less
pollution. If we can minimize
breakage, implement reusable
glass containers, we could come
nearer our goal of resource
conservation.
The events that led up to this
chance for students to make the
decision were an aftermath of
winter quarter Recycle Day. We
want to build one strong support
that Recycle Day received into
permanent change. SCREP was
established and student members
met with University officials. We
received warm cooperation, help
and advice from Alan Cummings,
Manager University Residences

stacey fitzsimmons, steve miller

and Mr. John Marston, Purchasing
Dept.,. Then we met with Mr.
Jerry Scott, and Mr. Chandler,
Canteen Inc., who hold the
University contract for the
vending service.
Student Support
They assured us of their
cooperation to make any change
providing we could demonstrate
student support for the 20 cents
price a bottle versus 15 cents a
can and accept the responsibility
for obtaining the 5 cents
difference by returning the bottles
at a University reclamation center.
In high volume areas, paper cup
vending machines for 10 cents per
eight ounce could be installed.
This is an easy change to make
because there are no financial
interests threatened among the
parties who hold authority to
make the decision.

the last ten days.
Vending Machines
There are 70 vending machines
on campus with an annual volume
of 400,000 bi-metal cans. These
tin-plated steel cans with
aluminum tops are a waste; almost
all end up in the garbage. The few
"recycled" are of minimal value as
an industrial copper precipitate,
worth only $10 per ton.
Yet these destroyed cans have
to be replaced for future
consumption, thus generating new
power demands and air and water
pollution from the production
process. Moreover, the demand
for the metals to manufacture the
cans spurs American corporations
in their headlong drive to exploit
the world's natural resources, with
the resulting corporate
intervention in the case of tin into
such countries as Bolivia, Malaysia
and Thailand. Though Stanford's
consumption does not cause a
large part of these problems, it
does contribute by its
unquestioned generation of waste.
To end this irrational situation
there are two alternatives for
Stanford; one, switching to
aluminum cans or, two,
reinstalling glass bottles which will
cost 20 cents with a 5 cent return
on the bottle from a campus
collection center.
It is this latter alternative that
we the study committee of the
Stanford Community for a
Responsible Environmental Policy
(SCREP) propose for student
body consideration.
Glass Bottles
The glass bottles are re-usable
without any fundamental
recycling, needing only a washing,
which means less energy

consumption and primary and
secondary air and water pollution.
Secondly, considering that no
return system will be perfect, the
waste of glass, being primarily
sand, is less significant a waste
than is aluminum.
Finally, even the inital glass
production, compared with that
of cans, demands less energy, less
resources and produces less
pollution. If we can minimize
breakage, implement reusable
glass containers, we could come
nearer our goal of resource
conservation.
The events that led up to this
chance for students to make the
decision were an aftermath of
winter quarter Recycle Day. We
want to build one strong support
that Recycle Day received into
permanent change. SCREP was
established and student members
met with University officials. We
received warm cooperation, help
and advice from Alan Cummings,
Manager University Residences

stacey fitzsimmons, steve miller

and Mr. John Marston, Purchasing
Dept.,. Then we met with Mr.
Jerry Scott, and Mr. Chandler,
Canteen Inc., who hold the
University contract for the
vending service.
Student Support
They assured us of their
cooperation to make any change
providing we could demonstrate
student support for the 20 cents
price a bottle versus 15 cents a
can and accept the responsibility
for obtaining the 5 cents
difference by returning the bottles
at a University reclamation center.
In high volume areas, paper cup
vending machines for 10 cents per
eight ounce could be installed.
This is an easy change to make
because there are no financial
interests threatened among the
parties who hold authority to
make the decision.

The Stanford community has a
size and affluence that make it a
formidable consumer. Since our
life styles make large demands
upon the resources of our
environment, it is worthwhile to
question our consumer habits and
tiieir consequences, and to seek
alternatives. Our aim should be
minimal drain on resources and
maximum reuse and recycling of
materials used.
One small, easy change can be

made now, making little demand
on our time, and placing no
financial burden on us or the
University. It is simply the
conversion of the vending
machines from bi metal soft drink
cans to returnable glass bottles,
and paper cups for higher volume
areas. The student body has had a
chance to enact such a change by
signing the petition going around
the last ten days.
