# Parks, Preserve Planned For Area
## 
### BOB DRAZOVICH 
The President's Land and
Building Development Committee
has approved plans for the
development of two new
conservation areas on the
Stanford Campus. The James
Michael Levin Memorial Park is a
recreation field being constructed
next to the Florence Moore
Dormitory.
The 2.1 acre site will be graded
and turfed to provide a field
similar to the grassed area next to
Wilbur Hall. Trees will be planted
arour.d the perimeter of the site.
Dan Rolfs of the University
Planning Office expressed the
need for such an area, pointing
out that there is no grass
recreation field anywhere on that
side of the campus.
Levin Park
The project is being financed
by Adam Levin, member of the
1970-71 ASSU Council of
Presidents. He has donated
$20,000 to the development of
the park, which is a memorial to
his brother James Michael. Levin's
brother died several years ago in
an automobile accident.

A second proposed
developmment is a "natural
preserve," for which 50 acres of
land between the Old Page Mill
Road and the New Page Mill
Freeway has been set aside.
The site, which borders
Matedero Creek, will be for
exclusive use of pedestrains. It
will be fenced to prohibit access
by bikes, cycles, and other motor
driven vehicles.
Minimum Development
The land will be for minimum
development, limited to only a
few foot paths. Because of the
lack of university funds for
establishment and upkeep of the
area, the Conservation Club is
attempting to organize student
assistnace to build the trails and
bridges, and to keep the area clean
after it is opened.
The Conservation Club hopes
that the area can be maintained
and administered without
university funds.
Both development areas have
to be approved by President
Lyman and the Development
Committee of the Board of
Trustees before work on
improvements can begin.

what you would have seen, the method of a master.

MAN'S BEST FRIEND—This little lad by the banks of Lake Lag is
not too sure that this large Labrador is really just curious. But then
perhaps he has a right to be cautious, since his friend may be looking
for a new partner in stick-retrieving.
