# Program Trains Minority Engineers
## 
### KATHY EISLER 
(Part Two of a Two-part Series)
The Electrical Engineering
Department, with the largest
graduate enrollment of any
department in the University,
implemented the Gibbons Plan for
the training of minority students
several years ago.
Dr. Gibbons, an Electrical
Engineer professor, was
motivitated to establish the
program in the Electrical
Engineering Department because,
in his opinion, studies of
mathematics, science, and
engineering are relatively free
from influences of cultural bias
that exist in other disciplines,
such as history or sociology.
The initial evaluation of a
candidate is based on an extensive
(but low pressure) personal
interview with the applicant, as
well as interviews with his

employer and other references
named by the candidate. Much
emphasis is placed on student
interest and recommendations.
After acceptance at this level,
the candidate then audits a
summer course in mathematics.
This trial period helps advisors
estimate the student's appropriate
academic starting point and also
his aptitude for the theoretical
side of engineering.
The final admissions decision is
based on the performance of the
candidate in this trial course.
Candidates who prove capable of
doing at least "B" level work in
regular Stanford courses, or who
otherwise give some evidence of
their academic abilities are
admitted to the program.
Two very important aspects of
the program are its lack of a quota
system and the fact that it is
self-sufficient. No quotas exist for

total numbers in the program or
for the ethnic distribution within
it. To date 17 blacks, five
Chicanos, one American Indian,
and one white are enrolled. Each
student is sponsored by his
company for complete tuition
(which is almost double the
part-time graduate student rate);
tutor salaries are supplied by the
EE Department.
Tutors are assigned on a
one-to-one basis with the students
for one hour of tutoring per hour
of class each week. Their job is to
help the student understand the
academic material and to act as a
friendly intermediaries between
the student and the University, to
ease the student through the
period of adjustment to school
life.
Most of the 23 tutors are Ph.D.
candidates and represent those
areas of science and math

included in the program. As in the
case of Ralph Kimball, the
program's first tutor, some of
them have also spent their
undergraduate years here. In order
to prevent any possible feelings of
dependency on the part of tht
student, tutors are changed even
quarter.
Although Gibbons is the
originator of the plan, Dr. Louis
Padulo, visiting professor from
Morehouse College, presently
administers the program. Padulo,
Chairman of the Math
Department at the black school in
Atlanta, Georgia, has taught at
Columbia and Harvard, and has
worked extensively for black
programs on the national level.
Throughout the program the
student remains a part of his
community. In effect, the
program is "continual, on-the-job
training," as Padulo says, for the

student earns more responsibility
for his work as he learns more.
Padulo's job has been to make
the program work. He spends up
to forty hours per week in the
selection, counseling, and
scheduling of courses and turoring
assignments of the students. When
questioned as to why he has
involved himself in the program,
Padulo says that "the worst crime
is insensitivity."
Padulo, aware of the extremely
experimental nature of the
program, has tried to anticipate
many of the possible objections,
and has worked to make the
program self-sufficient. It now
costs the EE department only
$3500 per year to run the
program (to pay one professor
half-time to head the program,
and tutors $3.50 per hour).
As yet the most advanced
students are just completing the
physics series. However, the
success of the program can be
measured partially by the
confidence of the participating
companies.
The future of the entire
program is unknown at this point.
Padulo would welcome an
increase in enrollment and states
that even a large influx of
students could be accomodated. It
should be noted that Padulo's
two-year invitation is almost
completed, and his status with
respect to the program is
uncertain.
Other departments at Stanford,
and many other universities, have
shown great interest in the
program. And, as Associate
Chairman of the EE Department
Ralph Smith states, "the program
will definitely be continued. We
are very pleased with it so
far. . . (it is) just a question of
who and how it (the
responsibility) will be divided."

two-year invitation is almost
completed, and his status with
respect to the program is
uncertain.
Other departments at Stanford,
and many other universities, have
shown great interest in the
program. And, as Associate
Chairman of the EE Department
Ralph Smith states, "the program
will definitely be continued. We
are very pleased with it so
far. . . (it is) just a question of
who and how it (the
responsibility) will be divided."
(Part Two of a Two-part Series)
The Electrical Engineering
Department, with the largest
graduate enrollment of any
department in the University,
implemented the Gibbons Plan for
the training of minority students
several years ago.
Dr. Gibbons, an Electrical
Engineer professor, was
motivitated to establish the
program in the Electrical
Engineering Department because,
in his opinion, studies of
mathematics, science, and
engineering are relatively free
from influences of cultural bias
that exist in other disciplines,
such as history or sociology.
The initial evaluation of a
candidate is based on an extensive
(but low pressure) personal
interview with the applicant, as
well as interviews with his

employer and other references
named by the candidate. Much
emphasis is placed on student
interest and recommendations.
After acceptance at this level,
the candidate then audits a
summer course in mathematics.
This trial period helps advisors
estimate the student's appropriate
academic starting point and also
his aptitude for the theoretical
side of engineering.
The final admissions decision is
based on the performance of the
candidate in this trial course.
Candidates who prove capable of
doing at least "B" level work in
regular Stanford courses, or who
otherwise give some evidence of
their academic abilities are
admitted to the program.
Two very important aspects of
the program are its lack of a quota
system and the fact that it is
self-sufficient. No quotas exist for

total numbers in the program or
for the ethnic distribution within
it. To date 17 blacks, five
Chicanos, one American Indian,
and one white are enrolled. Each
student is sponsored by his
company for complete tuition
(which is almost double the
part-time graduate student rate);
tutor salaries are supplied by the
EE Department.
Tutors are assigned on a
one-to-one basis with the students
for one hour of tutoring per hour
of class each week. Their job is to
help the student understand the
academic material and to act as a
friendly intermediaries between
the student and the University, to
ease the student through the
period of adjustment to school
life.
Most of the 23 tutors are Ph.D.
candidates and represent those
areas of science and math

included in the program. As in the
case of Ralph Kimball, the
program's first tutor, some of
them have also spent their
undergraduate years here. In order
to prevent any possible feelings of
dependency on the part of tht
student, tutors are changed even
quarter.
Although Gibbons is the
originator of the plan, Dr. Louis
Padulo, visiting professor from
Morehouse College, presently
administers the program. Padulo,
Chairman of the Math
Department at the black school in
Atlanta, Georgia, has taught at
Columbia and Harvard, and has
worked extensively for black
programs on the national level.
Throughout the program the
student remains a part of his
community. In effect, the
program is "continual, on-the-job
training," as Padulo says, for the

student earns more responsibility
for his work as he learns more.
Padulo's job has been to make
the program work. He spends up
to forty hours per week in the
selection, counseling, and
scheduling of courses and turoring
assignments of the students. When
questioned as to why he has
involved himself in the program,
Padulo says that "the worst crime
is insensitivity."
Padulo, aware of the extremely
experimental nature of the
program, has tried to anticipate
many of the possible objections,
and has worked to make the
program self-sufficient. It now
costs the EE department only
$3500 per year to run the
program (to pay one professor
half-time to head the program,
and tutors $3.50 per hour).
As yet the most advanced
students are just completing the
physics series. However, the
success of the program can be
measured partially by the
confidence of the participating
companies.
The future of the entire
program is unknown at this point.
Padulo would welcome an
increase in enrollment and states
that even a large influx of
students could be accomodated. It
should be noted that Padulo's
two-year invitation is almost
completed, and his status with
respect to the program is
uncertain.
