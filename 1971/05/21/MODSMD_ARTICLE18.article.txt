# YR President
## 
### 
Noel Casey, a first-year
business student and Reagan
supporter, was elected President
of the Stanford Chapter of the
Young Republicans last night,
defeating Barry Whitesides, a
backer of Republican maverick
Paul McCloskey (R-San Mateo).
Nick Neubauer, a second-year
law student, was elected
Executive Vice President, and
Peter Brimelow, also a business
student, was chosen as Treasurer.
Immediately following his
election, Casey declared that "The
Stanford Young Republicans will
support the superb programs of
the Republican administration in
Sacramento." Casey also
remarked that McCloskey "is
unwittingly echoing Radio
Hanoi's attack on American
motives and tactics in Indochina."
