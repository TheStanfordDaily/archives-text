# Nixon Announces Breakthrough In US, USSR Nuclear Arms Talks
## 
### 
WASHINGTON AP - President Nixon
announced yesterday what he termed a
major step in breaking the stalemate on
nuclear arms talks between the United
States and the Soviet Union.
Nixon * went on nationwide
radio-television at noon to read a brief
statement about the long-stalled U.S.
Soviet Strategic Arms Limitation Talks,
SALT, timed with a similar statement
issued in Moscow.
The President said that as a result of
negotiations at the highest level, the
United States and the Soviet Union:
"Have agreed to concentrate this
year on working out an agreement for
the limitation of the deployment of
antiballistic missile systems ABM's."
"Have also agreed that, together
with concluding an agreement to limit
ABM's they will agree on certain
measures with respect to the limitation
of offensive strategic weapons."
"The two sides are taking this course
in the conviction that it will create

more favorable conditions for further
negotiations to limit all strategic arms,"
the statement added.
"These negotiations will be actively
pursued."
Republicans and some other
Democrats rated the development
favorable.
Whether the two superpowers will
actually reach a disarmament accord in
the talks that began in 1969 remains to
be seen. White House officials
acknowledged that the two sides have
not abandoned basic positions, which
so far have defied lengthy efforts by
negotiators for an agreement.
But the high level announcement did
seem to indicate an interest by the
leaders of both great powers in pushing
ahead with the search for an accord on
curbing the nuclear arms race, rather
than letting the effort die in a
diplomatic stalemate.
White House officials declined to
predict an arms limiting agreement with

the Soviets will be reached this year.
But they said that with the new high
level political impetus from Washington
and Moscow they expect the pace of
negotiations to quicken.
Whether either the United States or
the Soviet Union made much of a
concession in issuing Thursday's
statement was not clear from the public
wording. Varying interpretations were
offered here and in Moscow.
The SALT talks which got underway
in Finland in the fall of 1969 have been
bogged down since last year over what
strategic weapons should be included in
an arms control deal. The basic U.S.
negotiating proposal as SALT has been
to offer a curb on ABM's in return for a
limit on offensive missiles, particularly

the giant Soviet SS9's.
White House officials said the work
on the Safeguard ABM will be going
ahead pending what might come out of
the SALT talks in the future.
The wording from Moscow of the
new statement clearly left open the
possibility that the Soviets will still
push for a separate ABM's only
agreement. They have a relatively small
ABM system now installed around
Moscow.
According to White House officials,
1. negotiations for curbs on offensive
nuclear weapons will be pursued at the
same time as the talks on ABM's and 2.
no ABM deal will be concluded without
an agreement also on limiting offensive
weapons.
