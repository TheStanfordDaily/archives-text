# Friend Of Leary
## Panama Stresses Unity, Action, Love 
### KATHY EISSLER 
"I assume full responsibility
for this planet and do here-by
declare it to be a disaster area."
John Dudley Panama, reborn
Brahma Putra and friend of
Timothy Leary, will lead a
student discussion on
"Revolution-Internal and
External" today at 12:15 p.m. in
Tresidder's small lounge.
"The world needs help -DO IT
NOW ... for if you don't do it, it
won't get done." Panama founded
"The Universal Church" on this
tenet in April (at the age of 22)
and is extablishing his first center
for PROJECT UNITY in Palo
Alto. "My life purpose is to
prepare the way for a has age by
unselfish derotion to Mankind,
but you've got to take the first
step in order to make the whole
thing possible."
This first step, according to
Panama, is the manifestation of an
internal change, of a revolution.
Any revolution has to occur first
in the mind; yet why are
revolutions necessary?
"Revolutions occur because we
want to create a rapid change in
ideas, concepts or states. The
means are many: LSD,
communication, personal
expression, self-discipline, God
('He's the best way I think so
far'), but they all relate to the
search for truth—for a way."
"Einstein proved that there is

some ultimate cause with Emc2,
but it is as yet undefined, other
than that we do know it exists."
This search for truth has placed
man on a cause-effect gradient,
where our relationship with men
is constantly varying. "We are all
people motivators. We either
motivate in a positive manner or a
negative one, lifelike or
deathlike."
"The truth makes us happy
and it does solve all our problems.
It's what we determine our life
by, but we don't even know what
it is. Each self is unique; each self
has its own truth. We all want to
link ourselves to the truth."
This is PROJECT UNITY-unity
through action and love.
Beginning in the Palo Alto area,
Panama will visit each college and
organize people interested in
helping the earth. Two people
from each group will then declare
the city a disaster area and state
that they will assume full
responsibility for it."The concept
is unique-no one has ever offered
to take responsibility for our
condition; its success is inherent
and predictable."
United Front
The next step will be calling
representatives from all religious
and humanitarian service groups
together to plan one project that
they can do together to help the
city, whether it be building parks
or planting trees. The goal is a

coordinated, united front on a
city level, the process consisting
of steps, gradually leading up to a
national effort.
"What is there to run to? What
is there to run from? Why don't
you just be here and confront
what must be done? .. . The
basic, basic problem on this planet
lies not in the political systems,
but in the reactive sections of the
minds which create and operate
said systems. If you yell,
'communism' or 'capitalism' is
wrong, you are wrong, because
the wrongness lies in the mind
which is operating the
system... not in the system
itself."
"The real world leaders are the
people with the money strings
tied to their politician puppets.
Less than ten men control this
planet and less than 50 men know
who they are. This is why no real
change occurs when a new
president, etc., takes office ... for
the people above this political
puppet don't want to change their
workable world marketing plan."
Panama is not bitter about the
system, however; he merely
advocates change, drastic but
nonviolent.
Instigator Interests
"War is a low vibratory form of
communication . . . when
someone shoots at you they are
trying to tell you
something ... The war in
Vietnam is a business where the
heads of the corporations involved

have ordered their employees to
kill each other over a bad real
estate deal. War is a
problem ... all problems can be
solved by locating the source of
the problem. The two parties
involved should sit down and
locate who is making a profit off
of their conflict. They will then
find the 'real promoter' and can
remove him."
Panama believes that those
involved are never the promoters,
that the instigators are by
definition third parties to the
scene and can include people
ranging with industrial interests to
entire countries.
Unification is Panama's
answer-unification through love
and action. The present welfare
system is a failure, Panama
believes, because it pays people
not to work. It is a reflection of
our entire economic system, for
full employment should be a goal,
a goal made possible by retraining
of individuals to find their own
valuable niche in society. This
internal revolution takes place
now in the school, but it must be
available to all.
Get Together
"In 1984 or thereabouts there
will be an open meeting between
our governments and the so-called
aliens!. .. . Flying saucers are
nothing more than inter-galactic,
electromagnetic, cosmic fastbacks.
No one is from another planet, for
no one is really from any planets.

for this planet and do here-by
declare it to be a disaster area."

nothing more than inter-galactic,
electromagnetic, cosmic fastbacks.
No one is from another planet, for
no one is really from any planets.
"I assume full responsibility
for this planet and do here-by
declare it to be a disaster area."
John Dudley Panama, reborn
Brahma Putra and friend of
Timothy Leary, will lead a
student discussion on
"Revolution-Internal and
External" today at 12:15 p.m. in
Tresidder's small lounge.
"The world needs help -DO IT
NOW ... for if you don't do it, it
won't get done." Panama founded
"The Universal Church" on this
tenet in April (at the age of 22)
and is extablishing his first center
for PROJECT UNITY in Palo
Alto. "My life purpose is to
prepare the way for a has age by
unselfish derotion to Mankind,
but you've got to take the first
step in order to make the whole
thing possible."
This first step, according to
Panama, is the manifestation of an
internal change, of a revolution.
Any revolution has to occur first
in the mind; yet why are
revolutions necessary?
"Revolutions occur because we
want to create a rapid change in
ideas, concepts or states. The
means are many: LSD,
communication, personal
expression, self-discipline, God
('He's the best way I think so
far'), but they all relate to the
search for truth—for a way."
"Einstein proved that there is

some ultimate cause with Emc2,
but it is as yet undefined, other
than that we do know it exists."
This search for truth has placed
man on a cause-effect gradient,
where our relationship with men
is constantly varying. "We are all
people motivators. We either
motivate in a positive manner or a
negative one, lifelike or
deathlike."
"The truth makes us happy
and it does solve all our problems.
It's what we determine our life
by, but we don't even know what
it is. Each self is unique; each self
has its own truth. We all want to
link ourselves to the truth."
This is PROJECT UNITY-unity
through action and love.
Beginning in the Palo Alto area,
Panama will visit each college and
organize people interested in
helping the earth. Two people
from each group will then declare
the city a disaster area and state
that they will assume full
responsibility for it."The concept
is unique-no one has ever offered
to take responsibility for our
condition; its success is inherent
and predictable."
United Front
The next step will be calling
representatives from all religious
and humanitarian service groups
together to plan one project that
they can do together to help the
city, whether it be building parks
or planting trees. The goal is a

coordinated, united front on a
city level, the process consisting
of steps, gradually leading up to a
national effort.
"What is there to run to? What
is there to run from? Why don't
you just be here and confront
what must be done? .. . The
basic, basic problem on this planet
lies not in the political systems,
but in the reactive sections of the
minds which create and operate
said systems. If you yell,
'communism' or 'capitalism' is
wrong, you are wrong, because
the wrongness lies in the mind
which is operating the
system... not in the system
itself."
"The real world leaders are the
people with the money strings
tied to their politician puppets.
Less than ten men control this
planet and less than 50 men know
who they are. This is why no real
change occurs when a new
president, etc., takes office ... for
the people above this political
puppet don't want to change their
workable world marketing plan."
Panama is not bitter about the
system, however; he merely
advocates change, drastic but
nonviolent.
Instigator Interests
"War is a low vibratory form of
communication . . . when
someone shoots at you they are
trying to tell you
something ... The war in
Vietnam is a business where the
heads of the corporations involved

have ordered their employees to
kill each other over a bad real
estate deal. War is a
problem ... all problems can be
solved by locating the source of
the problem. The two parties
involved should sit down and
locate who is making a profit off
of their conflict. They will then
find the 'real promoter' and can
remove him."
Panama believes that those
involved are never the promoters,
that the instigators are by
definition third parties to the
scene and can include people
ranging with industrial interests to
entire countries.
Unification is Panama's
answer-unification through love
and action. The present welfare
system is a failure, Panama
believes, because it pays people
not to work. It is a reflection of
our entire economic system, for
full employment should be a goal,
a goal made possible by retraining
of individuals to find their own
valuable niche in society. This
internal revolution takes place
now in the school, but it must be
available to all.
Get Together
"In 1984 or thereabouts there
will be an open meeting between
our governments and the so-called
aliens!. .. . Flying saucers are
nothing more than inter-galactic,
electromagnetic, cosmic fastbacks.
No one is from another planet, for
no one is really from any planets.

"I assume full responsibility
for this planet and do here-by
declare it to be a disaster area."
John Dudley Panama, reborn
Brahma Putra and friend of
Timothy Leary, will lead a
student discussion on
"Revolution-Internal and
External" today at 12:15 p.m. in
Tresidder's small lounge.
"The world needs help -DO IT
NOW ... for if you don't do it, it
won't get done." Panama founded
"The Universal Church" on this
tenet in April (at the age of 22)
and is extablishing his first center
for PROJECT UNITY in Palo
Alto. "My life purpose is to
prepare the way for a has age by
unselfish derotion to Mankind,
but you've got to take the first
step in order to make the whole
thing possible."
This first step, according to
Panama, is the manifestation of an
internal change, of a revolution.
Any revolution has to occur first
in the mind; yet why are
revolutions necessary?
"Revolutions occur because we
want to create a rapid change in
ideas, concepts or states. The
means are many: LSD,
communication, personal
expression, self-discipline, God
('He's the best way I think so
far'), but they all relate to the
search for truth—for a way."
"Einstein proved that there is

some ultimate cause with Emc2,
but it is as yet undefined, other
than that we do know it exists."
This search for truth has placed
man on a cause-effect gradient,
where our relationship with men
is constantly varying. "We are all
people motivators. We either
motivate in a positive manner or a
negative one, lifelike or
deathlike."
"The truth makes us happy
and it does solve all our problems.
It's what we determine our life
by, but we don't even know what
it is. Each self is unique; each self
has its own truth. We all want to
link ourselves to the truth."
This is PROJECT UNITY-unity
through action and love.
Beginning in the Palo Alto area,
Panama will visit each college and
organize people interested in
helping the earth. Two people
from each group will then declare
the city a disaster area and state
that they will assume full
responsibility for it."The concept
is unique-no one has ever offered
to take responsibility for our
condition; its success is inherent
and predictable."
United Front
The next step will be calling
representatives from all religious
and humanitarian service groups
together to plan one project that
they can do together to help the
city, whether it be building parks
or planting trees. The goal is a

coordinated, united front on a
city level, the process consisting
of steps, gradually leading up to a
national effort.
"What is there to run to? What
is there to run from? Why don't
you just be here and confront
what must be done? .. . The
basic, basic problem on this planet
lies not in the political systems,
but in the reactive sections of the
minds which create and operate
said systems. If you yell,
'communism' or 'capitalism' is
wrong, you are wrong, because
the wrongness lies in the mind
which is operating the
system... not in the system
itself."
"The real world leaders are the
people with the money strings
tied to their politician puppets.
Less than ten men control this
planet and less than 50 men know
who they are. This is why no real
change occurs when a new
president, etc., takes office ... for
the people above this political
puppet don't want to change their
workable world marketing plan."
Panama is not bitter about the
system, however; he merely
advocates change, drastic but
nonviolent.
Instigator Interests
"War is a low vibratory form of
communication . . . when
someone shoots at you they are
trying to tell you
something ... The war in
Vietnam is a business where the
heads of the corporations involved

have ordered their employees to
kill each other over a bad real
estate deal. War is a
problem ... all problems can be
solved by locating the source of
the problem. The two parties
involved should sit down and
locate who is making a profit off
of their conflict. They will then
find the 'real promoter' and can
remove him."
Panama believes that those
involved are never the promoters,
that the instigators are by
definition third parties to the
scene and can include people
ranging with industrial interests to
entire countries.
Unification is Panama's
answer-unification through love
and action. The present welfare
system is a failure, Panama
believes, because it pays people
not to work. It is a reflection of
our entire economic system, for
full employment should be a goal,
a goal made possible by retraining
of individuals to find their own
valuable niche in society. This
internal revolution takes place
now in the school, but it must be
available to all.
