# Avalanche Of Addicts Expected In Bay Area
## 
### 
Perhaps as many as 5,000
returning veterans who became
heroin addicts in Vietnam will
flood the San Francisco Bay Area
within the next year, an ex-user
who now heads a drug prevention
program said yesterday.
Kenneth McDonald, president
of Drug Awareness Inc. of
Mountain View, told Professor
Zimbardds social psychology
class at least 1,000 are likely to
settle in Santa Clara County.
McDonald, 42, said he "kicked
the habit" with methadone
treatment after 27 years of daily
use. He outlined plans to
campaign for $50,000 in an
attempt to get $150,000 in
federal matching funds to
establish a drug clinic.
He said such clinics would

provide medical help and
counseling to the predicted inflow
of Vietnam addicts and the
existing group of users, estimated
at 2,500.
McDonald said addicts need
$100 per day to maintain a habit,
often obtained by some form of
theft. With 2,500 addicts in the
county, he said, this represents
about $250,000.
McDonald said if the influx of
new GI users materializes, the cost
of crime will substantially increase
since each addict usually "turns
up" four or five friends.
He said his drug awareness
program, based primarily on a
transition to methadone, would
substantially reduce the cost of
crime in the county which is
reflected in taxes, insurance, court
costs and police work.
