# Low-Cost Housing
## 
### JIM DEERINGER 
"Many of our urban poor literally have nothing to lose if our cities
burn," states Neal Mitchell, world-renowned pioneer in the field of
low-cost housing. "We must build housing units that have spacial
flexibility over time to meet the needs of dynamic families." He
cautions, however, "Faceless modules such as Secretary of Hud
George Romney wants will be a disaster."
Mitchell, probably the only man to have ever resigned from a full
professorship at Harvard at the age of 35, gave three presentations
yesterday concerning the problems of low-cost housing. He has
devoted the past seven years to the research, design, and development
of innovative housing through the use of systems that can be altered
to meet changing needs. He is now the head of his own consultant
firm.
Mitchell finds much to criticize in the way professionals have gone
about providing low-cost housing. "Government housing projects
provide housing for those in an area of relative stability," he states,
rather than for the "bridgeheaders" who live in utter squalor and need
low-cost housing most. The government, charges Mitchell, determines
who is eligible for housing aid by asking questions like, 'Is he a good
citizen?' or 'Is he productive?' Thus, those who need low-cost housing
most go virtually unaided.
HUD is interested in the system that is cheapest in the short run,
according to Mitchell. "If we had that in the field of transportation,"
he quips, "we'd still be on horseback."
"We've managed to build a static housing system," says Mitchell.
"It is simply not responsive to the needs of people." Livability and
human satisfaction are difficult criteria to quantify, he admits, "but if
we don't, we're nowhere."
Negative System
In the U.S., Mitchell charges, our housing system is negative,
degenerating. We manage to get consumer goods into slums but don't
provide sufficient living space. Slum housing in underdeveloped
couniries by contrast strikes Mitchell as being "increasing, expanding,
upbuilding" in nature; marked by "hope rather than despair."
"Housing is very low on our list of national priorities," Mitchell
notes. "Every administration that comes in thinks that a viable
housing system should be developed in six months." Little thoughtful,
long-range planning has gone into housing systems development,
however.
Mitchell is doing about as much as one man could possibly do to
advance the cause of livable low-cost housing.
