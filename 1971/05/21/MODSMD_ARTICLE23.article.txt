# Hornsby's Hysteria
## Spirit Freshens Jazz-Rock 
### CAPTAIN HORNSBY (Spirit—Twelve Dreams of Dr. Sardonicus) (Epic Records E30267) 
The whole brouhaha about the
fusion of rock and jazz has
spawned some curious anomalies.
The concept of jazz-rock was
originated about four years ago by
some nameless apologist who felt
that the connotations of jazz as a
musically sophisticated art form
would lend further legitimacy to a
style of music which the Beatles
had managed to make respectable.
This concept was picked up in
turn by a horde of publicists and
hype-artists and carried to
ludicrous lengths. Record
company biographies of their rock
stars carefully noted that the boys
in the band had listened
ceaselessly to recordings of
Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday,
Bessie Smith, Leadbelly, Charles
Ives, and Wagner during their
formative years, and had managed
to meld these musical inspirations
with their impressions of life out
on the street to thrust them into
the vanguard of the rock
happening, into far-out, heavy
places where the hand of man had
never before set foot.
Publicity
The second Blood, Sweat, and
Tears album, after the departure
of A 1 Kooper, was a brilliant
example of jazz-rock publicity.
The sparse liner notes are a
triumph of bullshit: "Nine
musicians—vital and diverse. Their

rich musical tapestries will stun
you. Brash and exciting, their
music is a wedding of jazz and
rock. For you and for those who
have waited so long—with
polished prose fancies—this album
is a joy of vision and design, the
freshest experience of its kind."
Yeah, but even when it's fr**sh,
bullshit is still bullshit. Eric Satie
and Billie Holiday together on one
album for the very first time—too
much.
Authentic 'Spirit'
And what of the poor
musicians who really did pay their
dues, who not only had listened
voluntarily to those old artists the
publicists had prated about but
also had appreciated them enough
to learn from them rather than to
exploit their names. The answer is
that they turn out some very good
albums that don't sell.
Spirit is an excellent case in
point. All five of the musicians in
Spirit have some sort of a
background in jazz, especially
pianist John Locke and guitarist
Randy California. All of their
material is original. Since the
summer of 1968, they have put

out four excellent albums, the
latest of which, "Twelve Dreams
of Dr. Sardonicus," was released
just a couple of months ago.
They play rock music very
well, and California's guitar
playing is consistently inspired.
He can play in an incredible
number of styles and has a
harmonic sense which is unique.
Few Sales
Spirit moves, but their record
sales don't. They've gotten very
little airplay, except for two cuts
culled from their albums as 4 s's,
"I Got A Line On You" and
"Nature's Way."
On all their albums, Spirit has
displayed an ability to sustain
musical themes from song to song.
There is a strong sense of
continuity in their music which
emerges most strikingly when you
listen to a couple of their albums
played in succession. It's sort of
an intangible quality which grows
on you with repeated listenings,
sort of a spirit which pervades all
their work.
That may not be why they call
themselves Spirit, but it's not a

bad reason. Spirit is worth
listening to. Try it sometime.
Rock On:
This weekend, the Rascals are
at the Fillmore with their new
chick singer and new guitarist and
minus their former resident
whirling dervish, Eddie Brigati.
The Rascals will undoubtedly do
several things from their new,
double record album on
Columbia, in which they move in
some new directions. Also on the
bill are Grootna and Grin.
On Sunday, the East Bay gives
you a choice between Johnny
Cash at the Oakland Coliseum and
the Incredible String Band at
Berkeley Community Theatre. Or
if you'd prefer to be talked at
instead of sung at, Comedian
Richard Pryor is at Mandrake's in
Berkeley.
Lone Mountain College's
production of the Who's
"Tommy" was apparently such a
success that it is being performed
again tonight and tomorrow night
as well as on four nights next
week. On Saturday, June 5,
singer-pianist-composer Roberta

Flack will be at the Berkeley
Community Theatre.
In Palo Alto this weekend, the
"Poppycock" at 135 University
will celebrate its Second
Reincarnation, this time being
transmogrified from "Mom's"
into "In Your Ear." "In Your
Ear" will try to bring a little bit of
the Fillmore to the Peninsula by
presenting two or three groups in
concert every Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Beer and food will
be served, with wine soon to
come.
For its first bill, "In Your Ear"
is presenting Shanti, an Indian
group which performed at
Fillmore West last weekend,
Festival of Light, a jazz-oriented
group from Santa Cruz, and an
acoustic group called Topsoil.
Admission is $ 2.0 0, and there's no
minimum.
Upcoming groups include
Gideon and Power, Dan Hicks and
His Hot Licks, John Lee Hocker,
Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGhee, Eric Andersen, and Cal
Tjader.
One last warning: The Tijuana
Brass is back.

SPIRIT—And you think you've got problems. Spirit is a solid
jazz-rock group, the Captain says, but they don't sell records like they
ought to. And they melt in the rain, not to mention water balloons. It
sure was a hell of a party Friday night, and we all had a good time.
But this is ridiculous.

sort of a spirit which pervades all
their work.
That may not be why they call
themselves Spirit, but it's not a

bad reason. Spirit is worth
listening to. Try it sometime.
Rock On:
This weekend, the Rascals are
at the Fillmore with their new
chick singer and new guitarist and
minus their former resident
whirling dervish, Eddie Brigati.
The Rascals will undoubtedly do
several things from their new,
double record album on
Columbia, in which they move in
some new directions. Also on the
bill are Grootna and Grin.
On Sunday, the East Bay gives
you a choice between Johnny
Cash at the Oakland Coliseum and
the Incredible String Band at
Berkeley Community Theatre. Or
if you'd prefer to be talked at
instead of sung at, Comedian
Richard Pryor is at Mandrake's in
Berkeley.
Lone Mountain College's
production of the Who's
"Tommy" was apparently such a
success that it is being performed
again tonight and tomorrow night
as well as on four nights next
week. On Saturday, June 5,
singer-pianist-composer Roberta

Flack will be at the Berkeley
Community Theatre.
In Palo Alto this weekend, the
"Poppycock" at 135 University
will celebrate its Second
Reincarnation, this time being
transmogrified from "Mom's"
into "In Your Ear." "In Your
Ear" will try to bring a little bit of
the Fillmore to the Peninsula by
presenting two or three groups in
concert every Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Beer and food will
be served, with wine soon to
come.
For its first bill, "In Your Ear"
is presenting Shanti, an Indian
group which performed at
Fillmore West last weekend,
Festival of Light, a jazz-oriented
group from Santa Cruz, and an
acoustic group called Topsoil.
Admission is $ 2.0 0, and there's no
minimum.
Upcoming groups include
Gideon and Power, Dan Hicks and
His Hot Licks, John Lee Hocker,
Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGhee, Eric Andersen, and Cal
Tjader.
One last warning: The Tijuana
Brass is back.

SPIRIT—And you think you've got problems. Spirit is a solid
jazz-rock group, the Captain says, but they don't sell records like they
ought to. And they melt in the rain, not to mention water balloons. It
sure was a hell of a party Friday night, and we all had a good time.
But this is ridiculous.
The whole brouhaha about the
fusion of rock and jazz has
spawned some curious anomalies.
The concept of jazz-rock was
originated about four years ago by
some nameless apologist who felt
that the connotations of jazz as a
musically sophisticated art form
would lend further legitimacy to a
style of music which the Beatles
had managed to make respectable.
This concept was picked up in
turn by a horde of publicists and
hype-artists and carried to
ludicrous lengths. Record
company biographies of their rock
stars carefully noted that the boys
in the band had listened
ceaselessly to recordings of
Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday,
Bessie Smith, Leadbelly, Charles
Ives, and Wagner during their
formative years, and had managed
to meld these musical inspirations
with their impressions of life out
on the street to thrust them into
the vanguard of the rock
happening, into far-out, heavy
places where the hand of man had
never before set foot.
Publicity
The second Blood, Sweat, and
Tears album, after the departure
of A 1 Kooper, was a brilliant
example of jazz-rock publicity.
The sparse liner notes are a
triumph of bullshit: "Nine
musicians—vital and diverse. Their

rich musical tapestries will stun
you. Brash and exciting, their
music is a wedding of jazz and
rock. For you and for those who
have waited so long—with
polished prose fancies—this album
is a joy of vision and design, the
freshest experience of its kind."
Yeah, but even when it's fr**sh,
bullshit is still bullshit. Eric Satie
and Billie Holiday together on one
album for the very first time—too
much.
Authentic 'Spirit'
And what of the poor
musicians who really did pay their
dues, who not only had listened
voluntarily to those old artists the
publicists had prated about but
also had appreciated them enough
to learn from them rather than to
exploit their names. The answer is
that they turn out some very good
albums that don't sell.
Spirit is an excellent case in
point. All five of the musicians in
Spirit have some sort of a
background in jazz, especially
pianist John Locke and guitarist
Randy California. All of their
material is original. Since the
summer of 1968, they have put

out four excellent albums, the
latest of which, "Twelve Dreams
of Dr. Sardonicus," was released
just a couple of months ago.
They play rock music very
well, and California's guitar
playing is consistently inspired.
He can play in an incredible
number of styles and has a
harmonic sense which is unique.
Few Sales
Spirit moves, but their record
sales don't. They've gotten very
little airplay, except for two cuts
culled from their albums as 4 s's,
"I Got A Line On You" and
"Nature's Way."
On all their albums, Spirit has
displayed an ability to sustain
musical themes from song to song.
There is a strong sense of
continuity in their music which
emerges most strikingly when you
listen to a couple of their albums
played in succession. It's sort of
an intangible quality which grows
on you with repeated listenings,
sort of a spirit which pervades all
their work.
That may not be why they call

bad reason. Spirit is worth

on the street to thrust them into
the vanguard of the rock
happening, into far-out, heavy
places where the hand of man had
never before set foot.
Publicity
The second Blood, Sweat, and
Tears album, after the departure
of A 1 Kooper, was a brilliant
example of jazz-rock publicity.
The sparse liner notes are a
triumph of bullshit: "Nine
musicians—vital and diverse. Their

rich musical tapestries will stun
you. Brash and exciting, their
music is a wedding of jazz and
rock. For you and for those who
have waited so long—with
polished prose fancies—this album
is a joy of vision and design, the
freshest experience of its kind."
Yeah, but even when it's fr**sh,
bullshit is still bullshit. Eric Satie
and Billie Holiday together on one
album for the very first time—too
much.
Authentic 'Spirit'
And what of the poor
musicians who really did pay their
dues, who not only had listened
voluntarily to those old artists the
publicists had prated about but
also had appreciated them enough
to learn from them rather than to
exploit their names. The answer is
that they turn out some very good
albums that don't sell.
Spirit is an excellent case in
point. All five of the musicians in
Spirit have some sort of a
background in jazz, especially
pianist John Locke and guitarist
Randy California. All of their
material is original. Since the
summer of 1968, they have put

out four excellent albums, the
latest of which, "Twelve Dreams
of Dr. Sardonicus," was released
just a couple of months ago.
They play rock music very
well, and California's guitar
playing is consistently inspired.
He can play in an incredible
number of styles and has a
harmonic sense which is unique.
Few Sales
Spirit moves, but their record
sales don't. They've gotten very
little airplay, except for two cuts
culled from their albums as 4 s's,
"I Got A Line On You" and
"Nature's Way."
On all their albums, Spirit has
displayed an ability to sustain
musical themes from song to song.
There is a strong sense of
continuity in their music which
emerges most strikingly when you
listen to a couple of their albums
played in succession. It's sort of
an intangible quality which grows
on you with repeated listenings,
sort of a spirit which pervades all
their work.
That may not be why they call
themselves Spirit, but it's not a

bad reason. Spirit is worth
listening to. Try it sometime.
Rock On:
This weekend, the Rascals are
at the Fillmore with their new
chick singer and new guitarist and
minus their former resident
whirling dervish, Eddie Brigati.
The Rascals will undoubtedly do
several things from their new,
double record album on
Columbia, in which they move in
some new directions. Also on the
bill are Grootna and Grin.
On Sunday, the East Bay gives
you a choice between Johnny
Cash at the Oakland Coliseum and
the Incredible String Band at
Berkeley Community Theatre. Or
if you'd prefer to be talked at
instead of sung at, Comedian
Richard Pryor is at Mandrake's in
Berkeley.
Lone Mountain College's
production of the Who's
"Tommy" was apparently such a
success that it is being performed
again tonight and tomorrow night
as well as on four nights next
week. On Saturday, June 5,
singer-pianist-composer Roberta

Flack will be at the Berkeley
Community Theatre.
In Palo Alto this weekend, the
"Poppycock" at 135 University
will celebrate its Second
Reincarnation, this time being
transmogrified from "Mom's"
into "In Your Ear." "In Your
Ear" will try to bring a little bit of
the Fillmore to the Peninsula by
presenting two or three groups in
concert every Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday. Beer and food will
be served, with wine soon to
come.
For its first bill, "In Your Ear"
is presenting Shanti, an Indian
group which performed at
Fillmore West last weekend,
Festival of Light, a jazz-oriented
group from Santa Cruz, and an
acoustic group called Topsoil.
Admission is $ 2.0 0, and there's no
minimum.
Upcoming groups include
Gideon and Power, Dan Hicks and
His Hot Licks, John Lee Hocker,
Sonny Terry and Brownie
McGhee, Eric Andersen, and Cal
Tjader.
One last warning: The Tijuana
Brass is back.

SPIRIT—And you think you've got problems. Spirit is a solid
jazz-rock group, the Captain says, but they don't sell records like they
ought to. And they melt in the rain, not to mention water balloons. It
sure was a hell of a party Friday night, and we all had a good time.
But this is ridiculous.
The whole brouhaha about the
fusion of rock and jazz has
spawned some curious anomalies.
The concept of jazz-rock was
originated about four years ago by
some nameless apologist who felt
that the connotations of jazz as a
musically sophisticated art form
would lend further legitimacy to a
style of music which the Beatles
had managed to make respectable.
This concept was picked up in
turn by a horde of publicists and
hype-artists and carried to
ludicrous lengths. Record
company biographies of their rock
stars carefully noted that the boys
in the band had listened
ceaselessly to recordings of
Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday,
Bessie Smith, Leadbelly, Charles
Ives, and Wagner during their
formative years, and had managed
to meld these musical inspirations
with their impressions of life out
on the street to thrust them into
the vanguard of the rock
happening, into far-out, heavy
places where the hand of man had
never before set foot.
