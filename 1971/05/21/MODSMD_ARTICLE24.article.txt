# 'King' Explodes In Church
## Revue Celebrates Acting

lonesco, from 'Exit the King'
And Mem Chu has turned into
a theater. Though it's a rather
unearthly place to stage a play,
The Company has pulled it off.
Their fast-paced opening night
production of "Exit The King"
was energetic, aggressive, and in
general quite an experience.
The playwright, Eugene
lonesco, has created his usual
high-intensity abstract
commentary in this play, which
revolves around a dying monarch.
King Berenger I is shown realizing
the inevitability of his death, then
rejecting it, and finally accepting
it.
As he moves toward his death,
his kingdom dissolves around him.
But, don't worry, fans, Mem
Chu is still standing. The
Company has even added three
thrones, the central one raised by
a series of steps, to form a set.
Thanks to some clever lighting
and satisfactory acting, the
symbolic crumbling of the
kingdom is achieved.
The production under the
direction of Glen Thompson,
manages to possibly hurdle
lonesco's staging roadblocks.
The play is held together by
the quick, self-exploding
characterization of Berenger
created by Colin Bruce. His insane
and intriguing facial expressions
combine with his mediocre
acrobatics to give a character
which the audience becomes
immediately attached to. Most
interesting is just where he does

his climbing on and around the
Mem Chu altar.
Debby Pauly, who plays the
personification of pervading doom
as Queen Marguerite, is adequate.
Though between lines she seems
more like a marble statue than a
character, when she does deliver a
line it is sharp and rather nasty in
keeping with Marguerite's nature.
Pauly seems to be yelling a good
deal, but then there are those ugly
Mem Chu acoustics to fight.
Berenger's second wife, Marie,
is played by Jane Hastings.
Although a bit unsure of herself at
first, she soon became the needed
princess of fantasy and hope for
King Berenger.
Scott Hunter, as the Doctor,
Executioner, and Astrologist is a
marvelous, exuberant old chap
whose lines never cease to bring
out a laugh.
Jeanne Keller as the Domestic
Help and Nurse is weak compared
to the rest of the cast, but
acceptable. The Guard and Army
is played by Clyde Dodge who
constructed a successfully dumb
back-up man when it comes to
alluding to the state of the
kingdom.
"Exit The King" is a play in
which believable characters must
be combined with unrealistic lines
and happenings. The difficulty lies
in making this incongruity work.
And The Company has done an
ample job of it.
"Exit The King" will be
playing at 8 :00 p.m. in Mem Chu
tonight and tomorrow night. One
of the details which serves to
embellish the production is that
it's free.

Wednesday night "Limited
Engagements" opened in the
Little Theater to the enthusiastic
cheers of the first night audience.
The show, or revue, is an
intriguing collection of short
pieces from various dramatic
genres ranging from straight
comedy, to musical, to the more
abstract experimental theater of
Samuel Beckett.
"Limited Engagements" is
therefore a sort of latter-day
vaudeville, offering something for
every taste. Its underlying theme,
which binds so effectively the
different pieces, appears to be
that the theater is not dead and
has only begun to realize its
potential.
By experimenting both
technically and with the acting,
each piece provides a different
perspective, a fresh interpretation
of the dramatic medium. And in
the end when the characters from
all the different pieces join in a
free-for-all finale, we realize that
"Limited Engagements" is a
celebration of the thrill of drama,
the joy of acting.

The pieces are well chosen by
director John Olon-Serymgeour
and energetically acted. Even
though some of the acting is a
little mechanical, I think the stress
is on exuberant performance and
this brings the production off as a
whole.
I have never been quite sure
how Gertrude Stein intended her
plays to be performed, yet the
interpretation of "In a Garden"
answers most of my questions.
The childlike atmosphere created
by the Lord Fauntelroy costumes
and the storybook scenery was
particularly effective.
"Out of the Flying Pan" (No,
that's not a typo) by David
Campton, was a fine parody of
present day political rhetoric
although it tended to lag after a
while. Leslie Muchmore and Terry
Hinz did an excellent job of
mocking the political doubletalk
which we have become so
accustomed ot.
The Beckett pieces "Come and
Go" and "Act Without Words"
were both well-staged even though
I must confess I didn't fully

understand them. Then again, I
don't think I was supposed to.
I was especially impressed by
Albee's "The Sandbox." This in
my eyes is some of Albee's better
work, before his more recent
fiascos. Sue Bales as the
overbearing wife and Cecily
Morgan as the persecuted
Grandmother, both turned in
admirable performances and the
skit was solidly directed.
The combination film-play
"Bitter Dialogue" of Garcia Lorca
was interesting but not wholly
successful. The rough transition
from theater to film, along with
the muffled soundtrack, tended to
obscure what was going on. The
montage was a bit clumsy, but on
the whole the work proved to be a
fascinating attempt to reconcile
the rivalry between theater and
film.
Praise should also go to the too
often unsung lighting crew who
came up with a number of
imaginative effects.
And despite all I've said, it is
worth a dollar. The show runs
tonight, tomorrow, and next
week, May 26-29 at 8 :00 p.m.

King Berenger I is shown realizing
the inevitability of his death, then
rejecting it, and finally accepting
it.
As he moves toward his death,
his kingdom dissolves around him.
But, don't worry, fans, Mem
Chu is still standing. The
Company has even added three
thrones, the central one raised by
a series of steps, to form a set.
Thanks to some clever lighting
and satisfactory acting, the
symbolic crumbling of the
kingdom is achieved.
The production under the
direction of Glen Thompson,
manages to possibly hurdle
lonesco's staging roadblocks.
The play is held together by
the quick, self-exploding
characterization of Berenger
created by Colin Bruce. His insane
and intriguing facial expressions
combine with his mediocre
acrobatics to give a character
which the audience becomes
immediately attached to. Most
interesting is just where he does

his climbing on and around the
Mem Chu altar.
Debby Pauly, who plays the
personification of pervading doom
as Queen Marguerite, is adequate.
Though between lines she seems
more like a marble statue than a
character, when she does deliver a
line it is sharp and rather nasty in
keeping with Marguerite's nature.
Pauly seems to be yelling a good
deal, but then there are those ugly
Mem Chu acoustics to fight.
Berenger's second wife, Marie,
is played by Jane Hastings.
Although a bit unsure of herself at
first, she soon became the needed
princess of fantasy and hope for
King Berenger.
Scott Hunter, as the Doctor,
Executioner, and Astrologist is a
marvelous, exuberant old chap
whose lines never cease to bring
out a laugh.
Jeanne Keller as the Domestic
Help and Nurse is weak compared
to the rest of the cast, but
acceptable. The Guard and Army
is played by Clyde Dodge who
constructed a successfully dumb
back-up man when it comes to
alluding to the state of the
kingdom.
"Exit The King" is a play in
which believable characters must
be combined with unrealistic lines
and happenings. The difficulty lies
in making this incongruity work.
And The Company has done an
ample job of it.
"Exit The King" will be
playing at 8 :00 p.m. in Mem Chu
tonight and tomorrow night. One
of the details which serves to
embellish the production is that
it's free.

Wednesday night "Limited
Engagements" opened in the
Little Theater to the enthusiastic
cheers of the first night audience.
The show, or revue, is an
intriguing collection of short
pieces from various dramatic
genres ranging from straight
comedy, to musical, to the more
abstract experimental theater of
Samuel Beckett.
"Limited Engagements" is
therefore a sort of latter-day
vaudeville, offering something for
every taste. Its underlying theme,
which binds so effectively the
different pieces, appears to be
that the theater is not dead and
has only begun to realize its
potential.
By experimenting both
technically and with the acting,
each piece provides a different
perspective, a fresh interpretation
of the dramatic medium. And in
the end when the characters from
all the different pieces join in a
free-for-all finale, we realize that
"Limited Engagements" is a
celebration of the thrill of drama,
the joy of acting.

The pieces are well chosen by
director John Olon-Serymgeour
and energetically acted. Even
though some of the acting is a
little mechanical, I think the stress
is on exuberant performance and
this brings the production off as a
whole.
I have never been quite sure
how Gertrude Stein intended her
plays to be performed, yet the
interpretation of "In a Garden"
answers most of my questions.
The childlike atmosphere created
by the Lord Fauntelroy costumes
and the storybook scenery was
particularly effective.
"Out of the Flying Pan" (No,
that's not a typo) by David
Campton, was a fine parody of
present day political rhetoric
although it tended to lag after a
while. Leslie Muchmore and Terry
Hinz did an excellent job of
mocking the political doubletalk
which we have become so
accustomed ot.
The Beckett pieces "Come and
Go" and "Act Without Words"
were both well-staged even though
I must confess I didn't fully

understand them. Then again, I
don't think I was supposed to.
I was especially impressed by
Albee's "The Sandbox." This in
my eyes is some of Albee's better
work, before his more recent
fiascos. Sue Bales as the
overbearing wife and Cecily
Morgan as the persecuted
Grandmother, both turned in
admirable performances and the
skit was solidly directed.
The combination film-play
"Bitter Dialogue" of Garcia Lorca
was interesting but not wholly
successful. The rough transition
from theater to film, along with
the muffled soundtrack, tended to
obscure what was going on. The
montage was a bit clumsy, but on
the whole the work proved to be a
fascinating attempt to reconcile
the rivalry between theater and
film.
Praise should also go to the too
often unsung lighting crew who
came up with a number of
imaginative effects.
And despite all I've said, it is
worth a dollar. The show runs
tonight, tomorrow, and next
week, May 26-29 at 8 :00 p.m.

acrobatics to give a character
which the audience becomes
immediately attached to. Most
interesting is just where he does

his climbing on and around the
Mem Chu altar.
Debby Pauly, who plays the
personification of pervading doom
as Queen Marguerite, is adequate.
Though between lines she seems
more like a marble statue than a
character, when she does deliver a
line it is sharp and rather nasty in
keeping with Marguerite's nature.
Pauly seems to be yelling a good
deal, but then there are those ugly
Mem Chu acoustics to fight.
Berenger's second wife, Marie,
is played by Jane Hastings.
Although a bit unsure of herself at
first, she soon became the needed
princess of fantasy and hope for
King Berenger.
Scott Hunter, as the Doctor,
Executioner, and Astrologist is a
marvelous, exuberant old chap
whose lines never cease to bring
out a laugh.
Jeanne Keller as the Domestic
Help and Nurse is weak compared
to the rest of the cast, but
acceptable. The Guard and Army
is played by Clyde Dodge who
constructed a successfully dumb
back-up man when it comes to
alluding to the state of the
kingdom.
"Exit The King" is a play in
which believable characters must
be combined with unrealistic lines
and happenings. The difficulty lies
in making this incongruity work.
And The Company has done an
ample job of it.
"Exit The King" will be
playing at 8 :00 p.m. in Mem Chu
tonight and tomorrow night. One
of the details which serves to
embellish the production is that
it's free.

Wednesday night "Limited
Engagements" opened in the
Little Theater to the enthusiastic
cheers of the first night audience.
The show, or revue, is an
intriguing collection of short
pieces from various dramatic
genres ranging from straight
comedy, to musical, to the more
abstract experimental theater of
Samuel Beckett.
"Limited Engagements" is
therefore a sort of latter-day
vaudeville, offering something for
every taste. Its underlying theme,
which binds so effectively the
different pieces, appears to be
that the theater is not dead and
has only begun to realize its
potential.
By experimenting both
technically and with the acting,
each piece provides a different
perspective, a fresh interpretation
of the dramatic medium. And in
the end when the characters from
all the different pieces join in a
free-for-all finale, we realize that
"Limited Engagements" is a
celebration of the thrill of drama,
the joy of acting.

The pieces are well chosen by
director John Olon-Serymgeour
and energetically acted. Even
though some of the acting is a
little mechanical, I think the stress
is on exuberant performance and
this brings the production off as a
whole.
I have never been quite sure
how Gertrude Stein intended her
plays to be performed, yet the
interpretation of "In a Garden"
answers most of my questions.
The childlike atmosphere created
by the Lord Fauntelroy costumes
and the storybook scenery was
particularly effective.
"Out of the Flying Pan" (No,
that's not a typo) by David
Campton, was a fine parody of
present day political rhetoric
although it tended to lag after a
while. Leslie Muchmore and Terry
Hinz did an excellent job of
mocking the political doubletalk
which we have become so
accustomed ot.
The Beckett pieces "Come and
Go" and "Act Without Words"
were both well-staged even though
I must confess I didn't fully

understand them. Then again, I
don't think I was supposed to.
I was especially impressed by
Albee's "The Sandbox." This in
my eyes is some of Albee's better
work, before his more recent
fiascos. Sue Bales as the
overbearing wife and Cecily
Morgan as the persecuted
Grandmother, both turned in
admirable performances and the
skit was solidly directed.
The combination film-play
"Bitter Dialogue" of Garcia Lorca
was interesting but not wholly
successful. The rough transition
from theater to film, along with
the muffled soundtrack, tended to
obscure what was going on. The
montage was a bit clumsy, but on
the whole the work proved to be a
fascinating attempt to reconcile
the rivalry between theater and
film.
Praise should also go to the too
often unsung lighting crew who
came up with a number of
imaginative effects.
And despite all I've said, it is
worth a dollar. The show runs
tonight, tomorrow, and next
week, May 26-29 at 8 :00 p.m.

lonesco, from 'Exit the King'
And Mem Chu has turned into
a theater. Though it's a rather
unearthly place to stage a play,
The Company has pulled it off.
Their fast-paced opening night
production of "Exit The King"
was energetic, aggressive, and in
general quite an experience.
The playwright, Eugene
lonesco, has created his usual
high-intensity abstract
commentary in this play, which
revolves around a dying monarch.
King Berenger I is shown realizing
the inevitability of his death, then
rejecting it, and finally accepting
it.
As he moves toward his death,
his kingdom dissolves around him.
But, don't worry, fans, Mem
Chu is still standing. The
Company has even added three
thrones, the central one raised by
a series of steps, to form a set.
Thanks to some clever lighting
and satisfactory acting, the
symbolic crumbling of the
kingdom is achieved.
The production under the
direction of Glen Thompson,
manages to possibly hurdle
lonesco's staging roadblocks.
The play is held together by
the quick, self-exploding
characterization of Berenger
created by Colin Bruce. His insane
and intriguing facial expressions
combine with his mediocre
acrobatics to give a character
which the audience becomes
immediately attached to. Most
interesting is just where he does

his climbing on and around the
Mem Chu altar.
