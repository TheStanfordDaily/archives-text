# Eastwood Dominates 'Beguiled'
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
To say that "The Beguiled" is the best
American film so far this year is not to say all that
much, though the film is a fascinating one. It is
notable as well, since it marks Don Siegel's first
excursion into conspicuously personal film-making
after a long career as an entertainingly efficient
director. Siegel has taken the plunge and even
some of his cult followers have withheld support
of "The Beguiled," but I think the case may be
that Siegel's most personal film is also his best.
The film can most easily be called a southern
gothic horror story, and while that only begins to
describe the film, it is more effective on that most
superficial level than anything Tennessee Williams
has done in years.
Clint Eastwood plays a wounded Union soldier
who is, at first, reluctantly taken in to recuperate
on an isolated southern plantation for girls. It isn't
long before each of the deprived women is
affected by the powerfully attractive Eastwood in
a very important way. Despite each one's intricate
schemes to lay claim to him, it is Eastwood,
despite his immobility, who remains in complete
control of the situation until the girls' final ghastly
coup.
On the most interesting level, the film is a story
of deprivation, jealousy and scheming, of women

without men, of an opportunistic male. The
emotional cross-currents between the women are
quite complex, as are the various relationships
Eastwood manages to carry on with them
simultaneously.
The film could perhaps also be taken as a study
of deterioration and death, of how assorted people
choose to fill the void between birth and death,
but this is probably more intellectual than Siegel
would intend.
"The Beguiled" marks Clint Eastwood's third
film for Don Siegel ("Dirty Harry," currently
shooting in San Francisco, is his fourth) and it is
undoubtedly his most impressive appearance yet.
To praise Eastwood may seem to be a joke, but
this is the first time he has been at all called upon
to act, to deliver lines with sub-texts, to deal with
the ambiguities of a situation.
What's more, Eastwood has what very few
recently risen actors have—a genuine screen
presence. Eastwood's persona has remained
relatively consistent ever since he strode upon the
scene in "A Fistful of Dollars" and even now, four
years and nine films later, it hasn't changed all that
much.
Eastwood has been cagey about his career and
it seems to have paid off—he's had more successful
films and fewer flops (both in number and
percentage-wise) than any other of the few
remaining stars.
