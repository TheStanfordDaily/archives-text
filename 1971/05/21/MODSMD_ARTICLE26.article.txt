# 'Tommy' Excells As Rock Opera
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The idea of a small college
being able to present a successful
multi-media production of the
Who's rock-opera, "Tommy" once
seemed as implausible to me as
Pat Paulsen defeating Richard
Nixon for the presidency.
But Lone Mountain College, a
small school in San Francisco, has
taken on the challenge with a
little help from a few students
from other colleges and some
other amateur performers and has
put together one of the finer local
entertainment events of the year.
Dancing, mime, singing,
instrumental music and film have

been combined into an amazing 1
hour and 4 0 minute experience
which moves as quickly and as
smoothly as almost any amateur
theater production I have seen in
recent years.
Since "Tommy" is the
prototype of the rock-opera, there
are few other similar productions
to compare it with and any
comparison with a more
conventional form of theater
would be grossly unfair.
Moving Experience
Still standing by itself as a
unique theatrical event, it is one
of the more moving theatrical
experiences I have had. Many

people are familiar with some of
the fine songs from the opera,
including "Pinball Wizard,"
"We're Not Gonna Take It"and
"See Me, Feel Me, Touch Me,
Heal Me," but one cannot really
appreciate "Tommy" until it is
performed on the stage.
The opera is a telling picture of
how a person can "see but still be
blind" and "hear but still be
deaf." And its personifications of
perversity trying to destroy
handicapped and innocent people
through drugs, sexual molestation,
and outright physical torture is
well-taken.
Unconventional Opera
The revelations the opera
provides in spots are quite
valuable, and although it lacks the
continuity and order of more
conventional works, its effect is
still strong. And its impact when
performed in this multi-media
manner is much greater than any
purely musical performance
could've been.
In any multi-media production,
it is the co-ordination between
different areas which is essential
to the success of the show. And
c ho r e og rapher-d irector John

Pasqualetti had done an
outstanding job in this area.
The use of multiple slides,
especially those of fields of
flowers when Tommy is being
given a bouquet, and those of
clouds when he has regained his
senses, add considerably to the
effect.
Outstanding Tommy
John Laschmann as Tommy is
outstanding. His dancing is strong
and his facial expressions are
remarkable examples of mime.
And when he has regained his
senses and "I'm Free" is being
played, his dancing and
movements convey freedom so
well that you really want to jump
out of your own skin.
The singing and instrumental
music are both remarkably close
to that of the Who's recorded
performance. But there are a few
problems.
One girl's facial contortions
make it appear as if she is dying
with almost every word. She has a
good, although sometimes
overly-harsh, voice and would be
allright if she only controlled her
disconcerting facial movements.

be sung by one of the two males,
as was intended. In today's world
of remarkable operations anything
is conceivable, but to have a girl
sing a song which beings: "When 1
was a young boy, I played the
silver ball," is just a bit strange.
Other than this -all the singers
are fine and both males did
outstanding jobs especially in
"See Me, Feel Me,. .and "I'm
Free."
The music as a whole was as
remarkable as the show. And it
ends with one of the greatest
theatrical climaxes 1 have ever
seen. When Tommy utters his
final dire lament of "See Me—Feel
Me—Touch Me—Heal Me" and the
music picks up into its "Listening
to you, 1 get the music" finale,
many people in the audience were
on their feet, clapping and
stomping. It is an outstanding
ending to a fine performance.
"Tommy" will continue
tonight, tomorrow night and next
Wednesday through Saturday with
performances nightly at 8:30,
with an added show on Friday
and Saturday at 10:45. Tickets
are $2.00 for students and $3.00
general and the college is located
at Turk and Masonic Streets in the
Ci!\
