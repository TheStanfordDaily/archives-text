# Tracksters In PAC-8 Meet
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Records will be shattered
today and tomorrow as athletes
compete in Seattle for conference
honors in the annual Pac-8 Track
and Field Championships.
Stanford will be represented by
a strong 19 man squad that hopes
to improve on its last place
standing in the conference after
the end of the dual meet season.
The trackmen will go into the
annual classic buoyed by their
exciting 76-69 victory over Cal,
last year's disqualified NCAA
champions.
Two Indians will go into the
meet having recorded the fastest
times in their events in the Pac-8
this season. Randy White,
undefeated in the 440
Intermediate Hurdles, bested Jim
Seymor of Washington at the scene

of the Pac-8 meet earlier this year
with a time of 50.7 to Seymour's
51.0. These two times are the best
in the conference by a wide
margin and White should win if he
continues the consistent
improvement he has shown
throughout the season.
Tim Nicholson did not
compete until a few weeks before
the end of the dual meet schedule,
but he already has recorded the
fastest time for the 880 in the
PAC- and has an excellent
chance for a first. Pete Fairchild
will also run in the 880.
Olympian Casey Carrigan has
vaulted 16-7 this season and has
the second highest mark in the
Pac-8 thus far this year. There are
four vaulters with marks of 16-6
behind Carrigan, however, and he
will have to vault well to gain any

points for the Indians.
Don Kardong and Arvid Kretz
have the best times in the three
mile behind the amazing Steve
Prefontaine of Oregon. Duncan
Mac Donald and Bob Coe will run
for the Cards in the mile but
Prefontaine is favored to win the
mile, two mile, and three mile
runs. All of the Card long distance
men have good chances of placing
behind the Oregon star, however.
Chuck Francis will carry
Stanford's hopes in the sprints.
Willie Deckard of USC leads the
conference in both the 100 and
the 220 with times of 9.2 and
20.2. Francis has run a 9.5 this
year and could win points for the
team.
One of the best opportunities
Stanford has to win an event is in
the 120 High Hurdles. Rick
Tipton has run the best Pac-8 time
this year and is tied with Lance
Babb at 13.7. These two runners
are tremendous rivals and the
competition should be intense.
Tipton will be joined by rivals and
the competition in the high
hurdles by teammate Tom Long
whose best time is 14.2.
Defending triple jump
champion Allen Meredith will
have a tough time this year since
seven men have had better jumps
this season. Meredith will have to
markedly improve on his best
1971 jump of 50-0 to defend his
crown against men like Cal's Jim
Fraser who jumped 53-1/4 against
UCLA.
Steve Davis will compete for
the Indians in the discus and the
shotput, and Steve Hopkins will
enter the javelin throw. Tom
Anderson faces tough competition
in the high jump and long jump
and the general outlook for
Stanford's chances in the field
events is bleak.

the 120 High Hurdles. Rick
Tipton has run the best Pac-8 time
this year and is tied with Lance
Babb at 13.7. These two runners
are tremendous rivals and the
competition should be intense.
Tipton will be joined by rivals and
the competition in the high
hurdles by teammate Tom Long
whose best time is 14.2.
Defending triple jump
champion Allen Meredith will
have a tough time this year since
seven men have had better jumps
this season. Meredith will have to
markedly improve on his best
1971 jump of 50-0 to defend his
crown against men like Cal's Jim
Fraser who jumped 53-1/4 against
UCLA.
Steve Davis will compete for
the Indians in the discus and the
shotput, and Steve Hopkins will
enter the javelin throw. Tom
Anderson faces tough competition
in the high jump and long jump
and the general outlook for
Stanford's chances in the field
events is bleak.

BREAKING AWAY-Clutching the baton passed by Rufus Shaw, Rick Tipton sprints away from his
OSU opponent as miler Duncan Mac Donald looks on. The Indians will compete in the Pac-8
Championships tomorrow in Seattle with television coverage of the finals beginning at 2 p.m. on KTVU.
Records will be shattered
today and tomorrow as athletes
compete in Seattle for conference
honors in the annual Pac-8 Track
and Field Championships.
Stanford will be represented by
a strong 19 man squad that hopes
to improve on its last place
standing in the conference after
the end of the dual meet season.
The trackmen will go into the
annual classic buoyed by their
exciting 76-69 victory over Cal,
last year's disqualified NCAA
champions.
Two Indians will go into the
meet having recorded the fastest
times in their events in the Pac-8
this season. Randy White,
undefeated in the 440
Intermediate Hurdles, bested Jim
Seymor of Washington at the scene

of the Pac-8 meet earlier this year
with a time of 50.7 to Seymour's
51.0. These two times are the best
in the conference by a wide
margin and White should win if he
continues the consistent
improvement he has shown
throughout the season.
Tim Nicholson did not
compete until a few weeks before
the end of the dual meet schedule,
but he already has recorded the
fastest time for the 880 in the
PAC- and has an excellent
chance for a first. Pete Fairchild
will also run in the 880.
Olympian Casey Carrigan has
vaulted 16-7 this season and has
the second highest mark in the
Pac-8 thus far this year. There are
four vaulters with marks of 16-6
behind Carrigan, however, and he
will have to vault well to gain any

points for the Indians.
Don Kardong and Arvid Kretz
have the best times in the three
mile behind the amazing Steve
Prefontaine of Oregon. Duncan
Mac Donald and Bob Coe will run
for the Cards in the mile but
Prefontaine is favored to win the
mile, two mile, and three mile
runs. All of the Card long distance
men have good chances of placing
behind the Oregon star, however.
Chuck Francis will carry
Stanford's hopes in the sprints.
Willie Deckard of USC leads the
conference in both the 100 and
the 220 with times of 9.2 and
20.2. Francis has run a 9.5 this
year and could win points for the
team.
