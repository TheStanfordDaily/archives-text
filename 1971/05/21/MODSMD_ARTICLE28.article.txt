# Golfers Slip To Third In Conference Finale
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
After leading for 36 holes, the Stanford golf team was overtaken
by USC and Oregon in the Pac-8 championships at Oregon last
Tuesday. Stanford finished third with 1205 strokes. The Indians were
14 strokes behind champion USC and eight behind the runner-up
Ducks.
In the individual standings Scott Masingill of Oregon State nipped
Doug Roxburgh by a stroke. Masingill finished with a four round
score of 292. The Cards' Tom Watson was five strokes back in seventh
place, while John Beers was in a three way tie for ninth place at 299.
The Indian golfers had a five-stroke lead at the halfway mark.
However, the Trojans, though 11 strokes behind the Cards, staged a
magnificent comeback to overtake the favored Indians. Stanford
coach Bud Finger said USC "played tremendous golf. USC played a
great golf game while we just played mediocre."
Finger went on to say that even if Stanford had played well, they
might have had trouble holding off the hot USC squad. The Trojan
team was led by Gary Sanders and Alan Tapio who tied with Oregon's
Dave Glenz for third place.
Cards Set For NCAA Championships
The Cards now face the NCAA championships to be held at the
University of Arizona from June 21 through 26. Though not yet
invited Finger's squad "is a cinch" to be asked. Six teams will go to
Tuscon from the West Coast. Finger rates Stanford, Oregon, and USC
as the top three, and all are sure to receive invitations. San Diego
State, Long Beach State, Fresno State, San Jose State, UCLA, and Los
Angeles State are all possible candidates for the remaining three spots.
Finger's outlook on the nationals is optimistic. It is unlikely that
Stanford will be on top after the tournament is over, but the Cards
"could possibly pull it off," according to the Stanford coach.
Houston, Texas, BYU, Florida, and Wake Forest have a pretty firm
hold on the top five spots. But the Indians, along with Oregon, USC,
Oklahoma State, Arizona State, and Oklahoma will vie for the lower
half of the top 10 college golf teams in the U.S.
Stanford aces Tom Watson and John Beers are both up for possible
All-American honors. Of course all will depend on their performance
in the NCAA's. Finger feels Beers has come along way since the
beginning of the season, and, if his performance continues in Tuscon
he could place high in the individual standings.
