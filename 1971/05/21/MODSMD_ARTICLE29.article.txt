# Face USC Today
## Stanford Tops Cougars, 8-4 
### 
EUGENE, Oregon: Stanford
began the road to a conference
championship on a triumphant
note yesterday afternoon at
Washington State by trouncing
WSU, 8-4. A two run outburst in
the sixth inning brought the Cards
from a 4-3 deficit into a
never-to-be-surmounted 5-4 lead.
Coach Ray Young's team now
faces its arch-rival USC in the
second game today. The Trojans
whipped Oregon, 6-2, in the first
game to set up the Stanford-IJSC
confrontation. Young plans on
throwing a left-hander, Jim Coate,
against SC to negate their hitting
power.
If the Indians beat USC, they
won't have to play again until the
final game Saturday afternoon
when either Bruce Schoen or Bob
Kammeyer will be hurling.
However, if Stanford loses, the
team will have to play the winner
of the Oregon-WSU game in the
nightcap of the tripleheader
today. The winner of that game
would then play USC on
Saturday.
Glen Johnson, Dan Shaw, A 1
O'Brien, and Dave Edson were the
heroes of yesterday's game.
Johnson, who got the starting
assignment at catcher, went two
for two at the plate and scored a
run. After a rocky second inning
in which the Cougars scored all
their runs, Dan Shaw settled down
to blank WSU the rest of the way
to improve his season record to
12-4.
O'Brien and Edson were the
standouts in the go-ahead sixth.
O'Brien singled home the tying
run and then Edson followed by
singling home the eventual
winner. Mike Nelson continued to
flex his regained batting strength

with a 400 foot homer in the late
innings.
Stanford had two of its stars
named to the first team of the
PAC- All-Conference team
Wednesday. Rod Boone, who
broke four Stanford single season
records in hits, at-bats, runs
scored, and RBl's while also tying
the home run mark, and A 1
O'Brien, who batted .364 in
conference play, were selected for
first team honors.
Named to the second team
were three more Indians, junior
pitcher Bob Kammeyer (4-2, 3.13
ERA), freshman first baseman
Mark Lucich (.317), and

sophomore right fielder Mike
Nelson (.327).
USC headed the list of all-star
performers by placing four of its
members on the first team:
re cord-setting pitcher Steve
Busby, second baseman Mike Ball,
shortstop Jeff Port, and outfielder
Tim Steele. Cal also placed two of
its players, PAC- batting
champion Gary Hernandez (.459)
and outfielder Steve Ohland.
The team was loaded with
youth; in fact, only three seniors
made the team, highlighting the
fact that most of the older players
have turned professional as many
of these stars will when they reach
the age of 21 or graduate.
