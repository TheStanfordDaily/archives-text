# 'Daily Cal' Publication May End This Monday
## 
### TOM GIVEN 
The U.C. Berkeley Publisher's Board
has delivered an ultimatum to the Daily
Californian, giving the student
newspaper until noon Monday to
publish without the three editors fired
Tuesday or face suspension of
publication.
The Board's decision came following
a four hour meeting where Public
Information Officer Richard Hafner,
representing Chancellor Heyns, asked
for an immediate suspension.
The Hafner motion was amended by
Matt Wilson, a student member of the
Board, proposing a Monday deadline to
give the staff time to comply.
The staff will meet on Sunday to
decide its response to the Board's
demand. It had voted earlier to support
the editors in their defiance of the
Board.
Statement Issued
The five-person Senior Editorial
Board of the paper has issued a
statement saying that after consulting
with its attorney, "it is our position
that this action is a clear violation of
the First Amendment."
"We are being disciplined for
exercising out rights as a free press,"
the statement added. "Our defense
will be that a free press has the
legitimate right to raise issues and that
the university has no right to attempt
to suppress the free press."
The three editors fired by the Board
also indicated that they have received
letters formally starting disciplinary
action by the University.

James Blogett, David Dozier, and
Fran Hawthorne said they received
letters yesterday from Willis A.
Shotwell, faculty coordinator of
university rules and facilities. They said
the letters invited them to come in for
hearing dates on charges of misconduct
that threatens the health or safety of
others, conduct affecting the suitability
to remain as students, and using
university facilities to organize
unlawful conduct.
Shotwell confirmed that three
students had been sent notices but
withheld their names, a standard
policy.
Findings of such a hearing can range
from clearance to expulsion.
Regents Stay Out
The U.C. Regents, meeting in San
Francisco, declined yesterday to add
their voices to the growing controversy.
They plan to remain quiet as long as
Berkeley administrators handle the
matter to their satisfaction.
As long as Berkeley administrators
were in control, "the less said by the
Regents, the better," noted Regent
Dean Watkins.
Regent John Canaday, a frequent
critic of student newspapers, said, "it
seems to me the Berkeley campus
administration has done an admirable
job. This, to me, is not a Regent's
matter."
The Regents will meet again
tomorrow, but no further action is
expected, until such time as the
Berkeley paper may choose to ignore
the Publisher's Board ultimatum.

hearing dates on charges of misconduct
that threatens the health or safety of
others, conduct affecting the suitability
to remain as students, and using
university facilities to organize
unlawful conduct.
Shotwell confirmed that three
students had been sent notices but
withheld their names, a standard
policy.
Findings of such a hearing can range
from clearance to expulsion.
Regents Stay Out
The U.C. Regents, meeting in San
Francisco, declined yesterday to add
their voices to the growing controversy.
They plan to remain quiet as long as
Berkeley administrators handle the
matter to their satisfaction.
As long as Berkeley administrators
were in control, "the less said by the
Regents, the better," noted Regent
Dean Watkins.
Regent John Canaday, a frequent
critic of student newspapers, said, "it
seems to me the Berkeley campus
administration has done an admirable
job. This, to me, is not a Regent's
matter."
The Regents will meet again
tomorrow, but no further action is
expected, until such time as the
Berkeley paper may choose to ignore
the Publisher's Board ultimatum.
