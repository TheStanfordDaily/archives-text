Market May Take Britain
PARIS — President Georges Pompidou and Prime
Minister Edward Heath ranged over Europe's future
yesterday with France authoritatively reported resolved
to let Britain join the Common Market.
Word of the historic shift in the position of the
Pompidou government came from high French
sources. They acknowledged, under questioning,
some tough issues have yet to be negotiated.
There was no confirmation from the British, who
twice were barred from membership by French vetoes
in the 1960'5.
British sources went no further than to say the
atmosphere was one of relaxed friendliness, without
formalities.
The president and prime minister were said to have
swapped ideas first about the sort of Europe each
wants. Then they were said to have discussed the role
a united Western Europe could play in the world,
meaning in such flashpoint areas as the Mideast, Asia
and in relations with the United States and with the
Communist powers.
Later, Pompidou and Heath outlined the sort of
parliamentary situation each faces on the question of
Common Market enlargement. This gave Heath the
chance to explain how his government expects to
cope with the fierce resistance within his own

Conservative party, and within the opposition Labor
party, on the matter of British entry. All British party
leaders are pledged to support him providing the terms
are not too stiff.
Russian Jews Convicted
MOSCOW — Nine Jews who had hoped to emigrate to
Israel were convicted yesterday in Leningrad of
charges stemming from an attempted air hijacking.
They received sentences ranging from one to 10 years
at hard labor.
The Tass news agency said the sentences read out
by Chief Judge Nina Isakova were greeted with
"general approval" in the courtroom.
Attendance at the trial was by written invitation
only from Judge Isakova.
Thus the nine-day trial ended as it began, in virtual
secrecy, although Tass contended all along it was an
open procedure.
"After a 1 1/2 week open trial in Leningrad," Tass
reported, "the court has passed sentence on a group
of criminals."
The 12 persons, tried and convicted last
December, were arrested on the tarmac of
Leningrad's Smolnoye Airport before they could
reach the 12 seater plane. In all, 23 others were
arrested that day or soon afterward, indicating the

police had advance knowledge of the attempt.
What the defendants had in common was their
wish to go to Israel. Most had applied for exit visas
and had been turned down. Others had spoken about
it.
Tass never reported their interest in leaving Russia,
except inferentially, by their alleged participation in
the plot.
Weapons Bill Approved
WASHINGTON — Rejecting efforts to put a Jan. 1,
1972, deadline on the Indochina war and to halt such
major weapons as the Safeguard anti-missile system,
the House Armed Services Committee approved
Thursday a $21.88 billion military hardware bill.
VC Supply Line Opened
SAIGON — The North Vietnamese gained a new
supply route through southern Laos yesterday just as
monsoons began flooding older routes farther to the
north.
This setback to allied commands in Indochina
came with the abandonment by Royal Laotian forces
of the last remaining outpost on the Bolovens Plateau
in southernmost Laos.
