# Preliminary Hearings On Tresidder Close
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
An ASSU Senate investigation of the management and employment policy of
Tresidder Union ended its preliminary hearings last night with many allegations
left in mid-air, but having uncovered what appear to be concrete violations of
University policy.
These charges will be brought up before the Tresidder Union Committee by the
four students recently appointed to it by the ASSU Senate, at a committee
meeting called for next Wednesday.
Says Scott Burke, who conducted the present hearings and demanded the
meeting, "There are so many things going wrong there at Tresidder, it's about time
we did something. They (the violations) have got to be stopped immediately."
The Committee is composed of four faculty, three members of the
administration, the four students, and Tresidder Director Forrest Tregea, who will
be faced with the responsibility of replying to the charges.
Two complaints likely to be raised are that the wives of two top managers of
Tresidder, Philip Duffy, Business Manager, and Rafael Henao, Director of the
Coffee House, also work at Tresidder, contrary to University regulations.
Certain to be raised is the question of grievance procedures. Mike Edwards, a
representative for the United Stanford Employees, an unofficial labor
organization on campus, stated that half of the workers laid off last February did
not know of the grievance procedures available, and most of those who did were
afraid to use them.
Conditions at the Tresidder Food Service were the subject of a wide range of
opinion. Walter Hare, one of the 12 workers laid off last February, was asked
what he thought of the sanitation. "The sanitation is very poor," he answered,
"None of the workers eat there."
Mrs. Harold Bacon, representing the alumni group Cap and Gown, described
the excellent catering service she received from Tresidder. "If you would look at
Unions throughout the country," she said, "you would see that we are very
fortunate."
The hearing also covered accusations made in an article appearing in The
Chaparral, published yesterday, which said that Tresidder had "achieved a new
high in mismanagement."
Editor John Shoch claimed that there were many ways in which the Tresidder
management could make it appear as though different services were losing money,
by the way in which janitorial and maintenance costs were assigned to them.
He hinted, but was unwilling to explicitly state that the Tresidder management
was deliberately trying to close the Coffee House using as justification
questionable methods of assigning the custodial costs, to make it appear that it
operates at a loss.
