# Zurcher Aims For Neutral Policy
## 
### MARK WEAVER 
Police should be "confrontation
resolving agencies" and should try to
avoid taking sides between forces of
change and a government resisting
change, according to Palo Alto Police
Chief James Zurcher.
Zurcher, who has been Palo Alto
Chief for less than a year, has already
come under fire from some sectors of
the Stanford community. He has been
criticized for his handling of the recent
Medical Center demonstration in which
several of his officers were injured, and
for the subsequent police search of the
Daily offices.
But Zurcher recognizes his problems
and notes that this is "a particularly
trying time for a police chief." As a
neutral agency within society, "it is
important that the police not take
sides, we shouldn't harass one side or

the other, our position certainly is one
of neutrality and we need to do our
work walking a tightrope," he says.
His desire to see the police act as a
confrontation resolving agency was
frustrated in the Stanford Medical
Center sit-in. When he was "asking to
speak to whomever thought he might
be the leader.. ." he says"I was
shouted down with obscenities and
threats . . ."
He feels that the police were "not
involved early enough" in the sit-in and
that "things had deteriorated to the
point where the demonstrators felt that
it was necessary ... to do what they
did." However, by that time "it
certainly was necessary for the good of
the hospital to remove them and we set
about our task of doing it,"he feels.
Reflecting his philosophy of
neutrality, the stern police chief
believes that "We're not there to

support either one, we're there to
insure that there are no law violations
and that the rights of any group or any
individual are not trampled."
"Uur plans were for a very peaceful
sort of thing, we intended to come to
the door to speak to them, urge them
to leave the premises. Our intentions
then were to allow an exit for them,
escort them out away from the
building, no arrests, no anything." The
Chief anticipated that a few would
passively sit-down and was prepared to
"gently pick them up and take them off
to the jail."
When asked about charges of police
brutality and unusual beatings, Zurcher
responds inquisitively: "You mean the
unusual beatings were directed toward
the policemen, is that what you're
saying? . . . Knowing of course that we
had 1 3 injuries, some so serious that
the officers are still off duty."
But does that justify the police
acting with violence?"lt certainly does,
when they're busy defending
themselves. I'm certain that if
somebody attacked you with a club
you would certainly want to defend
yourself, or suffer the consequences of
a very foolhearty non-defense.
"This is the situation the police were
in when the demonstrators charged. It
was a very vicious and savage attack,
certainly not something that we had
expected.
"We have found no observors who
indicate that there was any misuse of
Zurcher, in referring to the recent
arson and bombings, offers little hope
for solution and prevention of terrorist
crimes which "are activities that are
accomplished in stealth, utilizing
everything that the terrorist has to
provide for anonymity."
Zurcher opposes recent proposals to
give police powers to campus security
police. He feels it "is a very serious
problem to give police powers to a
group of people who are not

answerable to any elected
representative." (In Palo Alto the
Police Chief is not elected, but he is
answerable to the City Manager, who
takes policy guidelines from the City
Councilâ€”an elected body.)
"I don't think that in our system it's
proper for all the police power to be
lodged in policemen who are not
answerable at some stage to the
electorate. I think that's unreasonable."
However, he does not feel that
neighborhood control of police is
necessary because most of the laws
police enforce are state laws, and
professional policemen "are honest and
apply the law as not only set by
statutes but as interpreted by the
court."
When speaking of the April search of
the Daily offices, the Chief sighs and
lowers his voice. "I'm very sensitive to
the area which we are now speaking of
and I am very sensitive to first
amendment rights and freedom of the
press." He notes that the warrant
specifically stated photographs and that
"we're not interested in personal notes.
We were interested in matters of
evidenciary value, which were the
photographs.
Zurcher states that, "I would
support every legitimate and legal
means and method to secure evidence."
He does not believe that a widespread
practice of searching newspaper offices
would have an adverse effect on
freedom of the press, but rather, "it
would force all of the tned'a to find
ways to do a better job . . . Perhaps the
media might find itself in the same
positions that we in police service do,
because we don't forcefully take
confessions from people any
more ... we don't engage in
entrapment; and all of these things have
made us a more professional
organization to do the job we have to
do."
