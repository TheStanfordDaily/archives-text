"Our tradition is that of Joe Hill and the IWW. It
is William Lloyd Garrison, Wendell Phillips,
Charles Sumner and John Brown. It is Tecumseh,
Sitting Bull, Nat Turner, Harriet Tubman, all of
whom are closer to whites than Che or Ho can ever
be. "
—Julius Lester
Radicals should not hate America. You know,
"Free Ericka, smash America,"and "Don't Bank
on Amerika."
At the end of a guerrilla theater in the San
Francisco Mayday demonstrations, the American
flag was burned. Since part of the thrust of all
demonstrations is education, this was a bad tactic.
It shifted the focus of attack from the war
corporations to America as a whole. Many people
who identify with the flag, but have reason to
oppose those corporations, saw the burning of the
flag as an attack on themselves.
NLF Flag
There is all the difference in the world between
burning an American flag and carrying a Viet Cong
flag. The former is an act of emotionalism that
does not appeal to anyone who is not already a
radical; the latter can be a noticeable educational
tool. Moderates against the war will ask why you
carry the NLF flag. Then you can explain to them
that the only just position on the war is support
for the Vietnamese revolution.
You whip out your list of facts showing (with
AID figures) that the only significant land reform
in Vietnam has been effected by the NLF, offering
myriad evidences (including Pentagon data) that
they are supported by the Vietnamese. Then your
listeners say Far Out and rush down to their local
war profiteers and seize the means of production.
The internationalist spirit of the American
student left has been important for breaking us
loose from racism and assumptions we had
engrained in us during high school, but it has
focused entirely on the Third World. We have lost
out on the valuable experience of recent Italian
labor struggles, of the French student revolt of
May, 1 968, and the lessons of Czechoslovakia's
attempt to wed plan and market in building a truly
democratic socialism. Most important, we have
lost touch with a great part of America.
If we want to build a mass movement toward a
humanitarian society we must love all of the
American people. America is NOT just General
Westmoreland and General Motors, even though it
is by them that the Third World most often knows
her. Still, if—as countless stories tell us—the
Vietnamese can distinguish between the rulers of
this country and America, so must we.

Where we direct our energies, whether it be
student organizing or supporting working class
struggles, it is a tactical decision. The revolution
must be for everyone, including camera shop
salesmen, doctors, engineers, or Stanford students
trying desperately to live up to stereotypes.
To build a movement here, we must understand
and acknowledge our American tradition. An
understanding of American history is crucial to
building a working analysis. We must understand
our own radical past, also. The one historical
American group that the Left pays attention to is
the Wobblies.
Palmer Raids
But the Socialist Party, the populists, and the
feminists all were making radical demands and
taking militant action in the early twentieth
century. To ask why the populists turned into a
lobbying group and why the feminists became
suffragettes is not posing an academic question. It
was not merely the Palmer raids that decimated
this country's Old Left.
Christopher Lasch's Agony of the American
Left, and For a New America, an anthology of
essays on American radical history from back
issues of Studies on the Left (eds. Weinstein and
Eakins) are two excellent books which deal with
these problems and draw conclusions applicable to
our movement. Staughton Lynd's "Prospects for
the New Left," (Liberation, February 20, 1971 )
compares strengths and weaknesses of the Old and
New Left and offers a general organizational
strategy for the future.
This may be interpreted as just one more of
Weil's red-baiting, anti-Venceremos columns. But
Venceremos has done a lot more-through the
Tenant's Union, People's Medical Clinic, and
support of workers' struggles, on campus and
off--to bridge the gap between student radicals
and the rest of America than groups whose
ideology I feel closer to have done.
Student Isolations
I really freaked when I read about passengers
on a train in Nanterre, France helping the police
beat students who were singing the Internationale
last year. In the reddest part of a country where
socialism is not a bad word, the most advanced
Western student movement seemed terrifyingly
isolated from the rest of the country.
Hopefully, continued "Serve the People"
projects combined with an understanding of our
American tradition will prevent this isolation here
when we take necessary future actions.
