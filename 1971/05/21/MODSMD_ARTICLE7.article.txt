## Is Distribution The Only Problem? 
### 
Americans awakening to the
realities of population pressure
now find themselves being
reassured by eminent wishful
thinkers that it's all a matter of
how the people are distributed.
Such a contention is predicated
upon a misapprehension of which
aspects of the population/
environment situation are critical,
and it simplistically assumes that
growth rate and distribution
patterns are independent
quantities. Also implicit is the
notion that redistribution is
"easy," as compared with facing
up to population growth itself.
The recently released report of
the Presidential Commission on
National Goals did not escape
these pitfalls; it identified
distribution as the major
population problem in the United
States, and implied that its
resolution would render
continued population growth and
quality of life in America
compatible. The time is therefore
appropriate to examine some of
the relevant arguments.
The average population density
of the United States is about
fifty-five persons per square mile
of land area (roughly the same as
the world average), as compared
to five persons per square mile in
Canada, 960 per square mile in
the Netherlands, and 75,000 per
square mile in Manhattan. The
figure for the Netherlands is

occasionally offered as "proof"
that the U.S. and the world as a
whole are hugely underpopulated;
the fact that the Netherlands is
self-sufficient in practically
nothing, relying on a more
sparsely populated world to
supply her with resources, is
overlooked. More generally, such
population density figures are
misused to argue that only urban
areas have population problems
(suggesting that congestion, heavy
smog, and sewage disposal
problems are the only symptoms
of overpopulation recognized by
those who so argue).
Unfortunately, the human
carrying capacity of a nation or a
continent is, in general, limited by
such factors as the quality of the
soils, the availability of water and
mineral resources, and the ability
of the environment to absorb
without lasting damage the
effluents of agricultural and
industrial technology. Vast
amounts of surface area may be
uninhabitable, uncultivable, or
simply very disagreeable places to
live.
Compelling Indicators
The most compelling indicators
of world overpopulation today
include the stress on food
supplies, the rapid depletion of
many high-grade resources, and
the threats to the viability of
life—giving environmental
systems. The first problem is
largely independent of population
distribution, as are the most

serious components of the third.
As we suggest below, all would
most probably be aggravated if
population distribution were
made more uniform. With regard
to resources and environmental
threats, of course, the
overdeveloped countries are the
prime offenders.
Consider the following largely
"distribution-free" problems.
Measurements at such diverse
locations as the mid-Pacific, the
Caucasus Mountains of the Soviet
Union, and Davos, Switzerland,
indicate that atmospheric
dustiness is increasing by perhaps
30 percent per decade. This global
blanket of dust, much of it of
agricultural origin, poses a serious
threat to the climatological
balance, and thus to world
agriculture itself. Residues of
chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides are now found
everywhere, including in the fat of
Antarctic penguins and in the
Greenland icecap. It has been
estimated that by the year 20 00
one-third to one-half of the
average daily fresh water runoff of
the United States will be flowing
through steam-electric power
stations, to be warmed by 10 to
20 degrees Fahrenheit in the
process. (This thermal impact will
occur regardless of where in the
United States the generated power
is consumed.) Liquid fossil fuels
are being burned at rates that
would exhaust estimated world
reserves in well under a century,
undermining preferable uses for
these large molecules in

Paul ehrlich, john holdren

lubrication, in the production of
plastics, and in protein culture.
Moving people to more
"habitable" areas, such as the
central valley of California or,
indeed, most suburbs, exacerbates
another serious problem—the
paving-over of prime farmland.
This is already so serious in
California that if current trends
continue, about 5 0 percent of the
best acreage in the nation's
leading agricultural state will be
destroyed by the year 2020.
Encouraging that trend hardly
seems wise with an inevitable
prospect of shrinking per capita
food supplies over the next
decades.
Whatever attempts may be
made to solve distribution-related
problems, they will be
undermined if population growth
continues, for two reasons. First,
population growth and the
aggravation of distribution
problems are correlated—part of
the increase will surely be
absorbed in urban areas that can
least afford the growth. Indeed,
barring the unlikely prompt
reversal of present trends, most of
it will be absorbed there. Second,
population growth puts a
disproportionate drain on the very
financial resources needed to
combat its symptoms. Economist
Joseph Spengler has estimated
that 4 percent of national income
goes to support our 1 percent per
year rate of population growth in
the United States. The 4 percent
figure now amounts to about
$30 -billion per year. It seems safe
to conclude that the faster we
grow, the less likely it is that we
will find the funds either to alter
population distribution patterns
or to deal more comprehensively
and realistically with our
problems.

California that if current trends
continue, about 5 0 percent of the
best acreage in the nation's
leading agricultural state will be
destroyed by the year 2020.
Encouraging that trend hardly
seems wise with an inevitable
prospect of shrinking per capita
food supplies over the next
decades.
Whatever attempts may be
made to solve distribution-related
problems, they will be
undermined if population growth
continues, for two reasons. First,
population growth and the
aggravation of distribution
problems are correlated—part of
the increase will surely be
absorbed in urban areas that can
least afford the growth. Indeed,
barring the unlikely prompt
reversal of present trends, most of
it will be absorbed there. Second,
population growth puts a
disproportionate drain on the very
financial resources needed to
combat its symptoms. Economist
Joseph Spengler has estimated
that 4 percent of national income
goes to support our 1 percent per
year rate of population growth in
the United States. The 4 percent
figure now amounts to about
$30 -billion per year. It seems safe
to conclude that the faster we
grow, the less likely it is that we
will find the funds either to alter
population distribution patterns
or to deal more comprehensively
and realistically with our
problems.

Americans awakening to the
realities of population pressure
now find themselves being
reassured by eminent wishful
thinkers that it's all a matter of
how the people are distributed.
Such a contention is predicated
upon a misapprehension of which
aspects of the population/
environment situation are critical,
and it simplistically assumes that
growth rate and distribution
patterns are independent
quantities. Also implicit is the
notion that redistribution is
"easy," as compared with facing
up to population growth itself.
The recently released report of
the Presidential Commission on
National Goals did not escape
these pitfalls; it identified
distribution as the major
population problem in the United
States, and implied that its
resolution would render
continued population growth and
quality of life in America
compatible. The time is therefore
appropriate to examine some of
the relevant arguments.
The average population density
of the United States is about
fifty-five persons per square mile
of land area (roughly the same as
the world average), as compared
to five persons per square mile in
Canada, 960 per square mile in
the Netherlands, and 75,000 per
square mile in Manhattan. The
figure for the Netherlands is

occasionally offered as "proof"
that the U.S. and the world as a
whole are hugely underpopulated;
the fact that the Netherlands is
self-sufficient in practically
nothing, relying on a more
sparsely populated world to
supply her with resources, is
overlooked. More generally, such
population density figures are
misused to argue that only urban
areas have population problems
(suggesting that congestion, heavy
smog, and sewage disposal
problems are the only symptoms
of overpopulation recognized by
those who so argue).
Unfortunately, the human
carrying capacity of a nation or a
continent is, in general, limited by
such factors as the quality of the
soils, the availability of water and
mineral resources, and the ability
of the environment to absorb
without lasting damage the
effluents of agricultural and
industrial technology. Vast
amounts of surface area may be
uninhabitable, uncultivable, or
simply very disagreeable places to
live.
Compelling Indicators
The most compelling indicators
of world overpopulation today
include the stress on food
supplies, the rapid depletion of
many high-grade resources, and
the threats to the viability of
life—giving environmental
systems. The first problem is
largely independent of population
distribution, as are the most

serious components of the third.
As we suggest below, all would
most probably be aggravated if
population distribution were
made more uniform. With regard
to resources and environmental
threats, of course, the
overdeveloped countries are the
prime offenders.
Consider the following largely
"distribution-free" problems.
Measurements at such diverse
locations as the mid-Pacific, the
Caucasus Mountains of the Soviet
Union, and Davos, Switzerland,
indicate that atmospheric
dustiness is increasing by perhaps
30 percent per decade. This global
blanket of dust, much of it of
agricultural origin, poses a serious
threat to the climatological
balance, and thus to world
agriculture itself. Residues of
chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides are now found
everywhere, including in the fat of
Antarctic penguins and in the
Greenland icecap. It has been
estimated that by the year 20 00
one-third to one-half of the
average daily fresh water runoff of
the United States will be flowing
through steam-electric power
stations, to be warmed by 10 to
20 degrees Fahrenheit in the
process. (This thermal impact will
occur regardless of where in the
United States the generated power
is consumed.) Liquid fossil fuels
are being burned at rates that
would exhaust estimated world
reserves in well under a century,
undermining preferable uses for
these large molecules in

Paul ehrlich, john holdren

lubrication, in the production of
plastics, and in protein culture.
Moving people to more
"habitable" areas, such as the
central valley of California or,
indeed, most suburbs, exacerbates
another serious problem—the
paving-over of prime farmland.
This is already so serious in
California that if current trends
continue, about 5 0 percent of the

overdeveloped countries are the
prime offenders.
Consider the following largely
"distribution-free" problems.
Measurements at such diverse
locations as the mid-Pacific, the
Caucasus Mountains of the Soviet
Union, and Davos, Switzerland,
indicate that atmospheric
dustiness is increasing by perhaps
30 percent per decade. This global
blanket of dust, much of it of
agricultural origin, poses a serious
threat to the climatological
balance, and thus to world
agriculture itself. Residues of
chlorinated hydrocarbon
pesticides are now found
everywhere, including in the fat of
Antarctic penguins and in the
Greenland icecap. It has been
estimated that by the year 20 00
one-third to one-half of the
average daily fresh water runoff of
the United States will be flowing
through steam-electric power
stations, to be warmed by 10 to
20 degrees Fahrenheit in the
process. (This thermal impact will
occur regardless of where in the
United States the generated power
is consumed.) Liquid fossil fuels
are being burned at rates that
would exhaust estimated world
reserves in well under a century,
undermining preferable uses for
these large molecules in

Paul ehrlich, john holdren

lubrication, in the production of
plastics, and in protein culture.
Moving people to more
"habitable" areas, such as the
central valley of California or,
indeed, most suburbs, exacerbates
another serious problem—the
paving-over of prime farmland.
This is already so serious in
California that if current trends
continue, about 5 0 percent of the
best acreage in the nation's
leading agricultural state will be
destroyed by the year 2020.
Encouraging that trend hardly
seems wise with an inevitable
prospect of shrinking per capita
food supplies over the next
decades.
Whatever attempts may be
made to solve distribution-related
problems, they will be
undermined if population growth
continues, for two reasons. First,
population growth and the
aggravation of distribution
problems are correlated—part of
the increase will surely be
absorbed in urban areas that can
least afford the growth. Indeed,
barring the unlikely prompt
reversal of present trends, most of
it will be absorbed there. Second,
population growth puts a
disproportionate drain on the very
financial resources needed to
combat its symptoms. Economist
Joseph Spengler has estimated
that 4 percent of national income
goes to support our 1 percent per
year rate of population growth in
the United States. The 4 percent
figure now amounts to about
$30 -billion per year. It seems safe
to conclude that the faster we
grow, the less likely it is that we
will find the funds either to alter
population distribution patterns
or to deal more comprehensively
and realistically with our
problems.

Americans awakening to the
realities of population pressure
now find themselves being
reassured by eminent wishful
thinkers that it's all a matter of
how the people are distributed.
Such a contention is predicated
upon a misapprehension of which
aspects of the population/
environment situation are critical,
and it simplistically assumes that
growth rate and distribution
patterns are independent
quantities. Also implicit is the
notion that redistribution is
"easy," as compared with facing
up to population growth itself.
The recently released report of
the Presidential Commission on
National Goals did not escape
these pitfalls; it identified
distribution as the major
population problem in the United
States, and implied that its
resolution would render
continued population growth and
quality of life in America
compatible. The time is therefore
appropriate to examine some of
the relevant arguments.
The average population density
of the United States is about
fifty-five persons per square mile
of land area (roughly the same as
the world average), as compared
to five persons per square mile in
Canada, 960 per square mile in
the Netherlands, and 75,000 per
square mile in Manhattan. The
figure for the Netherlands is

occasionally offered as "proof"
that the U.S. and the world as a
whole are hugely underpopulated;
the fact that the Netherlands is
self-sufficient in practically
nothing, relying on a more
sparsely populated world to
supply her with resources, is
overlooked. More generally, such
population density figures are
misused to argue that only urban
areas have population problems
(suggesting that congestion, heavy
smog, and sewage disposal
problems are the only symptoms
of overpopulation recognized by
those who so argue).
Unfortunately, the human
carrying capacity of a nation or a
continent is, in general, limited by
such factors as the quality of the
soils, the availability of water and
mineral resources, and the ability
of the environment to absorb
without lasting damage the
effluents of agricultural and
industrial technology. Vast
amounts of surface area may be
uninhabitable, uncultivable, or
simply very disagreeable places to
live.
Compelling Indicators
The most compelling indicators
of world overpopulation today
include the stress on food
supplies, the rapid depletion of
many high-grade resources, and
the threats to the viability of
life—giving environmental
systems. The first problem is
largely independent of population
distribution, as are the most

serious components of the third.
As we suggest below, all would
most probably be aggravated if
population distribution were
made more uniform. With regard
to resources and environmental
threats, of course, the
overdeveloped countries are the
prime offenders.
