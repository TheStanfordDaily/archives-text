## McGovern: New Politician 
### 
George McGovern is a Senator
from South Dakota who is
running for the Presidency of the
United States. McGovern is 4 8
years old and not particularly
handsome. He speaks with a quiet
voice in simple, easy-to-under
stand terms. Once you hear him
speak you realize that there is
nothing very elaborate or fancy
about what he has to say. He tells
you what he believes in, and what
he intends to do if elected
President to help make America a
decent place to live.
But, more importantly George
McGovern represents a change in
American politics; a change from
the politics of power and
self-glorification, to a new politics
of honesty and conviction—a

change that many of us long for in
this critical period of American
history.
America is faced with
tremendous problems that the
present administration refuses to
confront. The slaughter and
destruction of Southeast Asia
continues with no end in sight.
Racism is rampant. Our decaying
cities are suffering from years of
neglect created by an insane
preoccupation with war and the
development of the weaponry of
war. Millions of Americans live in
abject poverty, suffering from
malnutrition and hopelessness.
These crucial problems and
Nixon's failure to deal with them
point to the critical importance of
the 19 72 elections for America's
future. It is clear that the charm
and charisma of some of the other
leading candidates for the
Presidency is simply not what is
needed to deal with these issues.
George McGovern possesses
other much more important
qualities that are to be found only
to a significantly lesser degree in
the other candidates. McGovern is
a good man with honesty,
conviction, integrity, and
forthrightness. His record proves
it.
George McGovern drafted the
original "McGovem-Hatfield
Amendment to End the War," and

he is the acknowledged leader of
the Senate doves in their struggle
to end the war. McGovern has
pledged that his first act if elected
President will be to pull out of
Vietnam immediately, and to seek
a forty billion dollar cut in the
Defense budget. George
McGovern has fought a long battle
to insure a decent diet for every
hungry American.
He has played an important
role as a principal sponsor of most
of the present food-stamp and
free school-lunch programs that
provide desperately needed
nutrition to millions of hungry
Americans.
His concern for the oppressed
people of this country prompted
the Rev. Jesse Jackson to say
recently, that McGovern was his
"President-in-exile." McGovern,
along with Representatives John
Conyers and Ron Dellums, has
called for full-scale congressional
investigations of war crimes in
Vietnam on the basis of the
Winter Soldier Testimony in
Detroit.
These are only a few of the
areas in which George McGovern
has played a leading role as
sponsor and advocate of
meaningful legislation. His record
clearly speaks for itself; but we in
the McGovern campaign believe

zach zwerdling

there is another extremely
important quality George
McGovern possesses that makes
him a unique candidate for the
Presidency.
George McGovern is honest. He
is the only announced candidate
for the Presidency at this time for
exactly that reason. His consistent
stand against our involvement in
Vietnam, first made public in a
speech on the Senate floor in
1963, is another example.
McGovern is not afraid to speak
his mind or conscience.
He believes that elections can
be won with honesty and
conviction; his career has proven
him right. The people of South
Dakota, a conservative
mid western state, have re-elected
George McGovern to national
office three times.
McGovern's record and
conviction clearly set him apart
from other prospective
candidates. It is this candor that
prompted Bobby Kennedy to say
shortly before his assassination
that "George McGovern is the
only decent man in the United
States Senate." This is why we are
supporting George McGovern.
George McGovern represents the
last chance we have for a new and
better America. 1 976 is too late.

his mind or conscience.
He believes that elections can
be won with honesty and
conviction; his career has proven
him right. The people of South
Dakota, a conservative
mid western state, have re-elected
George McGovern to national
office three times.
McGovern's record and
conviction clearly set him apart
from other prospective
candidates. It is this candor that
prompted Bobby Kennedy to say
shortly before his assassination
that "George McGovern is the
only decent man in the United
States Senate." This is why we are
supporting George McGovern.
George McGovern represents the
last chance we have for a new and
better America. 1 976 is too late.
(Zach Zwerdling is a
sophomore history major.)
George McGovern is a Senator
from South Dakota who is
running for the Presidency of the
United States. McGovern is 4 8
years old and not particularly
handsome. He speaks with a quiet
voice in simple, easy-to-under
stand terms. Once you hear him
speak you realize that there is
nothing very elaborate or fancy
about what he has to say. He tells
you what he believes in, and what
he intends to do if elected
President to help make America a
decent place to live.
But, more importantly George
McGovern represents a change in
American politics; a change from
the politics of power and
self-glorification, to a new politics
of honesty and conviction—a

change that many of us long for in
this critical period of American
history.
America is faced with
tremendous problems that the
present administration refuses to
confront. The slaughter and
destruction of Southeast Asia
continues with no end in sight.
Racism is rampant. Our decaying
cities are suffering from years of
neglect created by an insane
preoccupation with war and the
development of the weaponry of
war. Millions of Americans live in
abject poverty, suffering from
malnutrition and hopelessness.
These crucial problems and
Nixon's failure to deal with them
point to the critical importance of
the 19 72 elections for America's
future. It is clear that the charm
and charisma of some of the other
leading candidates for the
Presidency is simply not what is
needed to deal with these issues.
George McGovern possesses
other much more important
qualities that are to be found only
to a significantly lesser degree in
the other candidates. McGovern is
a good man with honesty,
conviction, integrity, and
forthrightness. His record proves
it.
George McGovern drafted the
original "McGovem-Hatfield
Amendment to End the War," and

he is the acknowledged leader of
the Senate doves in their struggle
to end the war. McGovern has
pledged that his first act if elected
President will be to pull out of
Vietnam immediately, and to seek
a forty billion dollar cut in the
Defense budget. George
McGovern has fought a long battle
to insure a decent diet for every
hungry American.
He has played an important
role as a principal sponsor of most
of the present food-stamp and
free school-lunch programs that
provide desperately needed
nutrition to millions of hungry
Americans.
His concern for the oppressed
people of this country prompted
the Rev. Jesse Jackson to say
recently, that McGovern was his
"President-in-exile." McGovern,
along with Representatives John
Conyers and Ron Dellums, has
called for full-scale congressional
investigations of war crimes in
Vietnam on the basis of the
Winter Soldier Testimony in
Detroit.
These are only a few of the
areas in which George McGovern
has played a leading role as
sponsor and advocate of
meaningful legislation. His record
clearly speaks for itself; but we in
the McGovern campaign believe

zach zwerdling

there is another extremely
important quality George
McGovern possesses that makes
him a unique candidate for the
Presidency.
George McGovern is honest. He
is the only announced candidate
for the Presidency at this time for
exactly that reason. His consistent
stand against our involvement in
Vietnam, first made public in a
speech on the Senate floor in
1963, is another example.
McGovern is not afraid to speak
his mind or conscience.
