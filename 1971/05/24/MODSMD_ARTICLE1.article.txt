# Praises Elijah Muhammad
## Ali Denounces Malcolm X 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
Former boxing king, Muhammad
Ali, floated into Frost Amphitheatre
and stung like a bee Friday afternoon,
as he told the black members of an
audience that exceeded 2500 that they
were being "misled and brainwashed"
by white people into accepting the
leadership of Malcolm X.
The former heavyweight champion,
who was described by a taller Leo
Bazile as a "genuine, 100 percent hero
of black America," was introduced
after the performance of a musical
tribute to Malcolm X by about 50
students from Bell Haven elementary
school.
Ali was visibly disturbed by the
commemoration to the slain black
leader, and accused the white man of
convincing black people to "follow a
hero after he's dead. How's he gonna
lead you when he's dead?"
But the thrust of the ex-champion's
fiery opening remarks was a vehement
denunciation of Malcolm X and equally
vigorous praise for Eligah Muhammad,
the head of the Black Muslims, who Ali
called the real leader of the black
people.
Racial Harmony
"The only reason Malcolm X said
racial harmony was possible was so he
could marry a white women," Ali
charged. "The reason people follow
him today is because he's dead, and
they can twist his words so that they
mean something else."
The audience, which moments
before had enthusiastically applauded
the musical tribute, listened silently as
Ali continued.
"Whenever I go into a college
dormitory," he shouted, "I see posters
of Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver,
Muhammed Ali, and Angela Davis. But
I've never seen one of Eligah
Muhammad, and he taught all of them!
The Afro don't mean a damn thing, and
'Right On Brother' don't mean a damn
thing if you don't recognize your
leader.

"You don't follow him because the
white man don't like him," he
continued. "They've (the white man)
decided that now that it's time for you
to go black, they'll tell you who your
heroes are."
Ali told the sundrenched listeners
that the white man approved of
Malcolm X because he went to school
and because he admitted the possibility
of racial harmony. Eligah Muhammad,
however, is a black nationalist, spouses
black separatism, and owns business
enterprises that are operated
exclusively by black people.
College Speaking Tour
The former boxing king, whose
appearance here is part of a nationwide
college speaking tour, moved from his
extemporaneous tongue-lashing into a
prepared "lecture" on the
"intoxications of life." Later, in a
fast-paced question-and-answer session,
Ali was asked why, if he thought all
black people were beautiful, did he call
the current heavyweight champion, Joe
Frazier, and the late Sonny Liston ugly.
"Just promotions," he replied,
calmly, referring to attempts to
publicize his fights. "But you know,"
he added, "some people really are
ugly . .. especially Joe Frazier."
Ali seemed perplexed as he began to
explain a Vitalis commercial in which
he and Frazier appeared shortly before
their March 8 title fight. "How did they
get two black brothers like Joe Frazier
and me to do a commercial using
Vitalis?" he asked. "We don't use
Vitalis. We use grease."
The former champion drew applause
when he told listeners, "I lost the
decision but Frazier took a whippin'.
"He (Frazier) hits hard though," Ali
admitted. "He hit me so hard in the
15th round that he jarred my kin folks
in Africa."
Belle Haven Admirers
When one of his young admirers
from Bell Haven elementary school

asked him if he "slipped on water" in
the 15th, Ali could only reply, "You're
my buddy."
Ali said that it costs him "$5,000 a
month to exist" and answered a flat no
when asked if he would go to Africa for
a fight.
"There's not enough money in it,"
he continued. "The promoters
wouldn't put up the money for a fight
there because Africa doesn't have a
contender. I'd much rather have a fight
here and let the Africans see it free via
satellite."
When asked if he would win his
draft appeal (Ali refused induction in
1967) now pending before the Supreme
Court, Ali replied, "I don't know; I
don't care. I'm just waiting for the
outcome."

a fight.
"There's not enough money in it,"
he continued. "The promoters
wouldn't put up the money for a fight
there because Africa doesn't have a
contender. I'd much rather have a fight
here and let the Africans see it free via
satellite."
When asked if he would win his
draft appeal (Ali refused induction in
1967) now pending before the Supreme
Court, Ali replied, "I don't know; I
don't care. I'm just waiting for the
outcome."

INTENT—Muhammed Ali stands with some admirers as he listens to the speakers
who preceded his talk given in Frost last Friday.
Former boxing king, Muhammad
Ali, floated into Frost Amphitheatre
and stung like a bee Friday afternoon,
as he told the black members of an
audience that exceeded 2500 that they
were being "misled and brainwashed"
by white people into accepting the
leadership of Malcolm X.
The former heavyweight champion,
who was described by a taller Leo
Bazile as a "genuine, 100 percent hero
of black America," was introduced
after the performance of a musical
tribute to Malcolm X by about 50
students from Bell Haven elementary
school.
Ali was visibly disturbed by the
commemoration to the slain black
leader, and accused the white man of
convincing black people to "follow a
hero after he's dead. How's he gonna
lead you when he's dead?"
But the thrust of the ex-champion's
fiery opening remarks was a vehement
denunciation of Malcolm X and equally
vigorous praise for Eligah Muhammad,
the head of the Black Muslims, who Ali
called the real leader of the black
people.
Racial Harmony
"The only reason Malcolm X said
racial harmony was possible was so he
could marry a white women," Ali
charged. "The reason people follow
him today is because he's dead, and
they can twist his words so that they
mean something else."
The audience, which moments
before had enthusiastically applauded
the musical tribute, listened silently as
Ali continued.
"Whenever I go into a college
dormitory," he shouted, "I see posters
of Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver,
Muhammed Ali, and Angela Davis. But
I've never seen one of Eligah
Muhammad, and he taught all of them!
The Afro don't mean a damn thing, and
'Right On Brother' don't mean a damn
thing if you don't recognize your
leader.

"You don't follow him because the
white man don't like him," he
continued. "They've (the white man)
decided that now that it's time for you
to go black, they'll tell you who your
heroes are."
Ali told the sundrenched listeners
that the white man approved of
Malcolm X because he went to school
and because he admitted the possibility
of racial harmony. Eligah Muhammad,
however, is a black nationalist, spouses
black separatism, and owns business
enterprises that are operated
exclusively by black people.
College Speaking Tour
The former boxing king, whose
appearance here is part of a nationwide
college speaking tour, moved from his
extemporaneous tongue-lashing into a
prepared "lecture" on the
"intoxications of life." Later, in a
fast-paced question-and-answer session,
Ali was asked why, if he thought all
black people were beautiful, did he call
the current heavyweight champion, Joe
Frazier, and the late Sonny Liston ugly.
"Just promotions," he replied,
calmly, referring to attempts to
publicize his fights. "But you know,"
he added, "some people really are
ugly . .. especially Joe Frazier."
Ali seemed perplexed as he began to
explain a Vitalis commercial in which
he and Frazier appeared shortly before
their March 8 title fight. "How did they
get two black brothers like Joe Frazier
and me to do a commercial using
Vitalis?" he asked. "We don't use
Vitalis. We use grease."
The former champion drew applause
when he told listeners, "I lost the
decision but Frazier took a whippin'.
"He (Frazier) hits hard though," Ali
admitted. "He hit me so hard in the
15th round that he jarred my kin folks
in Africa."
Belle Haven Admirers
When one of his young admirers
from Bell Haven elementary school

asked him if he "slipped on water" in
the 15th, Ali could only reply, "You're
my buddy."
Ali said that it costs him "$5,000 a
month to exist" and answered a flat no
when asked if he would go to Africa for
a fight.
"There's not enough money in it,"
he continued. "The promoters
wouldn't put up the money for a fight
there because Africa doesn't have a
contender. I'd much rather have a fight
here and let the Africans see it free via
