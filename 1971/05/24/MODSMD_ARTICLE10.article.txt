# stringer system
## Solve Readability Gap 
### 
rae poodell

Scientists can't write, and writers
can't understand science- trite but
usually true. As a result, the public
can't understand either science or what
is written about it.
The damage caused by this
readability gap is of course
immeasurable, Ultimately the public
lias the decisions about what will
happen to science, since only the
government can afford <o finance most
basic research. The public's current
ignorance about the workings ol
science breeds fear, awe,
contempt and irrational decisions.
The question is what to do about it.
Most scientists blame the news media
for the poor way in which scientific
information is conveyed to the public.
They point out that news stories are
often sensationalized: the reporter
twists each new development into a
"major new breakthrough" in order to
win space from Ins editor. And the
selection of information is erratic:
stories come to the attention of the
press usually by means of a convention,
a university public relations bureau, or
the scientist himself
Inaccuracies accumulate at each step

in the information chain. The news
bureau, for instance, translates the
scientist's report into "newsworthy"
copy; the reporter rewrites the bureau's
story; the editor deletes and alters parts
of the reporter's story and the reader
adds his own interpretation.
One of the worst sins of the media,
in the scientist's mind, is that science
reporters have no real training in
science. "If a sports writer knew as
little about baseball as a science writer
knows about science, he'd be drummed
out of the corps," as Dr. Wolfgang K.H.
I'anofsky. Director of SI,AC, puts it.
Newsmen do not have the background
to interpret new developments and put
ilirm into perspective, (leorge Dusheek
of KQKD's Newsroom once said he
docs not understand himself some of
the technical information lie passes on
to his viewers.
One of the few constructive
suggestions from a scientist about the
science reporting dilemma was made by
Dr. I'anofsky in an interview May 12.
lie proposed a stringer system, similar
to the kind used in sports reporting,
(iraduate students in kc\ university

departments could be hired to report to
a newspaper or wire service any
significant developments within their
department. Most scientists can't write;
it would be a matter of "finding the
one who can."
Such a system would put the
selection and writing of science news in
the hands of people trained in science.
It would also eliminate one or two of
the potential sources of inaccuracy in
the information chain: the story could
go from scientist to editor.
The idea has problems which would
have to be worked out, of course.
There is, for example, the question of
whether science students could be
found with sufficient training and
inclination to serve as stringers.
The media would undoubtedly have
to take the initiative. Most would not
be interested. Hut perhaps a few, those
which now have full-time science
reporters, would. These full-time
reporters could conceivably set lip an
ad hoc stringer system 011 their own.
Why not? It's at least worth
considering.

Scientists can't write, and writers
can't understand science- trite but
usually true. As a result, the public
can't understand either science or what
is written about it.
The damage caused by this
readability gap is of course
immeasurable, Ultimately the public
lias the decisions about what will
happen to science, since only the
government can afford <o finance most
basic research. The public's current
ignorance about the workings ol
science breeds fear, awe,
contempt and irrational decisions.
The question is what to do about it.
Most scientists blame the news media
for the poor way in which scientific
information is conveyed to the public.
They point out that news stories are
often sensationalized: the reporter
twists each new development into a
"major new breakthrough" in order to
win space from Ins editor. And the
selection of information is erratic:
stories come to the attention of the
press usually by means of a convention,
a university public relations bureau, or
the scientist himself
Inaccuracies accumulate at each step

in the information chain. The news
