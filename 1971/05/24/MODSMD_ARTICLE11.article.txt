## Remarks To Engineers By An Engineer 
### 
stan glantz

I feel anxious about attitudes
in the School of Engineering and
about the possibility of violence
between Stanford's technical and
non-technical communities. I fear
that the actions of extremists in
each community will bring the
moderates into opposition.
While the School of
Engineering complains about lack
of understanding of Engineering
in the outside world, it has made
little effort to understand why
people are so upset. In their
ignorance engineers often take a
condescending and closed-minded
attitude toward outsiders, a
situation hardly conducive to a
reasoned discussion aimed at
discovering what the people
involved want and why.
All rational discussion is based
on axioms. Since the basic laws of
engineering are fundamental and
unchanging, we tend to forget
that these laws are based on
axioms. We tend to forget that all
rational conclusions are based on
axioms, and that if you change
the axioms, the conclusions
change.
Technical education glosses
over this point; when people
suggest what they consider
reasonable actions (based on their
axioms), we dismiss them as
irrational and appear
condescending and snobbish.
Instead, we ought to examine the
axioms.
Axioms
I take A Communication to the
School of Engineering from Dean
Joseph M. Pettit (May 1970) and
An Introspection of SEL
Research: The Case for a Review

as my main sources of the
School's axioms.
To begin discussion the
School's relationship with DOD,
we ought to put the War in
Indochina in its proper
perspective. Both Communication
and Introspection take great pains
to point out that Stanford is
doing nothing to prosecute the
daily war in Indochina;
Communication states:
There is also an expressed
belief that we can truly cripple
the national war machine by
forcing some of our colleagues to
stop thinking about scientific
matters because it is contributing
to the present war. We would
cripple only ourselves. The impact
on military operations would be
negligible.
War Made Possible
Almost everyone I have heard
speak here agrees that changing
the nature of Stanford's research
would not affect the current war.
People do, however, speak of the
basic work Stanford did years ago
that made this war possible, and
of the work that Stanford is doing
to make future wars possible with
ever more sophisticated methods
and weapons.
Introspection would deny even
this allegation; it states:
"... [In] DOD funding of basic
research any 'mission relevancy'
was typically unidentifiable." On
the other hand, if we examine for
example, the contracts valued
over $75,000 listed in DOD
Sponsored Research on the
Stanford Campus, 1968, we get a
slightly different picture.
The contracts in this list

involved about 70 percent of the
DOD funded research in the
School and about 40 percent of
the total funded research. Many
of these projects have clear and
present military applications. As
for potential civilian applications,
1 generally agree with ex-Secretary
of Commerce Luther Hodges.
Of the total present research
and development effort,
overwhelmingly oriented to
defense, relatively little is directed
toward the creation of new
consumer products, or to improve
machines to make the products,
or to improve the processes to
make the machines.
Contrary to the School's
axioms, the source of funding has
effected the kinds of questions
that have been studied here. While
it is impossible to forsee all
applications of a given research,
we are developing the kind of
technology that the military
needs, as opposed to the
technologies most of society
needs.
I have talked to many faculty
members who want to turn from
the theoretical problems
generated by military and space
technology to the theoretical
problems generated by medical,
transit, or housing technologies.
Professor Richard Pantell is
moving from quantum electronics
to ecological problems of the Bay
Area. He comments:
If the scientists views himself
as a modeler he can apply his
ability as a modeler to new
problems. Unfortunately, while
general modelling ability will
transfer, most particular expertise

will not. Essentially, you must
become a novice in your new
field. In addition, the indicators
used in the academic reward
system drop. It all adds up to a
strong incentive to stay in your
current area of expertise.
Agencies Identified
Some people believe that the
source of funding does not affect
the kinds of questions studied.
This belief is reflected in the
axiom that it is nearly impossible
to sort the DOD contracts from
the NSF contracts. I randomly
selected ten DOD and ten NSF
current Stanford contracts, and
asked a number of graduate
students in engineering and
science to identify the funding
agency. I expected an average of
ten errors. Instead the mean error
rate is between three and four!
Hardly consistent with the axiom.
Furthermore, if you insist that
this axiom holds for your area, I
submit that it is further evidence
of how DOD — as the prime
source of funding — has effected
the kinds of questions that are
asked. If a professor told me, "I
am interested in studying X, and
the DOD just happens to be
interested in funding it," I would
reply that he is interested in X
because X is what other people
have been able to get funding to
study.
The School's booklet,
Sponsored Research in the School
of Engineering — The Role of
Research Coordination points out
that faculty ought to maintain
similar interests with those of
their sponsors:
A strong and direct contact
between the principal investigator
and the research sponsor
(technical staff, mainly) must be
developed and maintained
throughout the contract period to
guarantee the optimum
coordination of interests, transfer
of results, etc. (This evidence of
personal interest is of most
genuine value when contract
renewal time again approaches.)
Some engineers point out that
they do basic research and if
someone else uses it for something
else, it is not their fault. This is a
school of engineering — of applied
science — not of physics. We are
concerned with how to do things,
not how the universe works.
Getting Answers
While we do contribute to
man's knowledge, our activities
are primarily aimed at getting
answers and making things work,
not merely understanding natural
phenomena. While most of the
research done here is abstracted a
few steps from real existing or

anticipated problems, it often can
be traced to these same problems.
In other words, there are
different kinds of technologies.
We are still clinging to the kind of
technology the military needs
while giving little attention to
other technologies. This conflict
between the goals of the military
and the general social welfare has
not always been present.
During and after World War 11,
technology's most important
contribution to the general
welfare was helping defend the
nation. But World War II ended a
generation ago, and things have
changed.
AGGRESSIVE NATION
Consider how you would view
the School of Engineering at
Stanford, if, for the sake of
argument you accepted General
David Shoup's (retired
Commandant of the Marine
Corps) statements:
1. America has become a
belligerent and aggressive nation.
2. In spite of civilian controls
and the national desire for peace,
this small group of men [defense
industries and military
establishment] exert much
influence on the government.
3. Somewhat like a religion,
the basic appeals of
anti-communism, national
defense, and patrioism provide the
foundation for a powerful
national creed upon which the
defense establishment can build,
grow, and justify its cost.
4. The dynamism of the
defense establishment and its
culture is also inspired and
stimulated by vast amounts of
money, by the new creations of
military research and material
development, and by the concepts
of Defense Department-supported
"th ink-factories."
Any citizen who accepts Gen.
Shoup's observations and the fact
that university research lays the
groundwork and sets the direction
for tomorrow's development,
must seriously question the
propriety of much of the research
that has been done and is being
done here.
OVERKILL
I have never advocated total
withdrawal of all kinds of
technology that are important for
the nation's military strength. To
do so would be to commit suicide.
But now that we have 250 times
overkill, we can end our
preoccupation with military kinds
of technology and reduce our
DOD funding to a more
reasonable level (say 10-15
percent of the research going on
in the School), and our talents can
also be applied to developing the

technologies of a livable world.
We must recognize the
concepts that:
We are abusing rationality by
using it as a defense mechanism to
avoid facing conclusions based on
anything but the values we
currently accept.
There is a strong, logically
consistent case that the kind of
work being done in the School is
helping keep the United States a
militarist and aggressive nation.
The notion of "basic research"
often acts as a smokescreen to
hide what we are doing from
others as well as to avoid facing
the consequences ourselves.
Many who oppose the kinds of
technology we are developing, do
so out of disappointment with
what we are doing, not
anti-intellectualism or opposition
to all research.
While much of our
fundamental knowledge will
transfer to other areas, many
poeple will be leaving years of
practical experience behind.
University research is not the
nation's highest priority.
If we come to grips with these
problems, and begin moving, I am
certain we will have the support
of the rest of the University.
If, on the other hand, we
continue setting up other people's
arguments as straw men, if we
continue to refuse to take a hard
look in the mirror, I can foresee
only more alienation, more

broken windows, and more time
lost. Even worse, 1 feel I would be
forced out of the profession
which 1 am most at home
intellectually and emotionally,
save my moral stance.
