# SWOPSI Research Study
## 
### 
Early this June SWOPSI will publish a report on "Sponsored
Research at Stanford," the outcome of a study performed this
term by the members of SCTR 151, a course organized by grad
student Stan Glantz, of the Department of Applied Mechanics,
and Prof. Holt Ashley, from the Department of Aeronautics and
Astronautics.
Actually a compendium of reports on each individual research
contract, the study is designed to give those not familiar with the
sciences and their associated technical vocabularies an
understanding of the nature of the research supported by these
contracts. In addition, brief statements from the points of view of
both the principal investigators and the contracting agencies (in
most cases, the Department of Defense) will be presented in an
attempt to point out the various, sometimes disparate,
explanations for and justifications of research done at
Stanford.
Realizing that bias can never be eliminated from such a study
(merely executing the study can be seen as a politically biased
act), we have made every effort to insure fairness in the
presentation of data on a very sensitive issue. Our statements are
extensively documented, from such sources as contract proposals
and interviews with the researchers. Furthermore, each researcher
will have ample space in the report to comment on or criticize
our presentation of his work.
Using this assemblage of data we hope to spend this summer
writing an analysis of sponsored research at Stanford, to be
published in a second volume next autumn.â€”Norm Albers.
