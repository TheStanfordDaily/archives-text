# SCIRE Programs
## Course Presentations Set 
### LARRY HUMMER CHARLES MERRILL 
In most classes students are
given an opportunity to learn and
then are left to find their own
applications for what they have
learned. SCIRE courses, designed
by students themselves, on the
other hand consider applications
as integral parts of the learning
process.
Three such action-oriented
courses created this quarter
concerned narcotics addiction,
police-student communications
and homosexuality. This week the
classes will hold open meetings to
report their progress to the
community.
The study program in narcotics
addiction, organized by
undergraduate Psychology majors
Richard Guajardo and Chuck
Klein, is oriented toward the
psychological treatment of
addiction.
The two students studied the
county methadone treatment
program, by reading about
methadone treatments, visiting
county treatment facilities, and
talking with counselors and
administrators in an effort to
formulate their own program.
"When we get all through with
this thing," Guajardo said, "we're
going to put together a report
with appendices and we'll make it
available to others."

They have also founded a
voluntary organization called
Drug Abuse Training Assistance
(DATA) to help train those
interested in counselling addicts.
Counselors would help the addict
undergoing methadone treatment
to attain competence at
educational, vocational, and social
skills.
It would not be a
psychotherapy program delving
into the addicts' past; instead, the
counsellors would tutor and
socialize with the addicts.
Involved in activities with
legitimate rewards and surrounded
by people liking him as a normal
person, the addict could end his
dependence on narcotics,
including methadone.
Break Stereotypes
The pol ice-student
communications class was
organized by Gary Reed, a
philosophy major who graduated
last spring. The course is designed
to break down stereotypes
through discussions between
students and policemen.
Fourteen students and ten
police officers from Menlo Park
and the Santa Clara County
Sheriff's Department signed up
for the course. The class read and
discussed a number of books on
police-community relations. Reed
also encouraged the students to
discuss politics, in an effort to
teach them how to talk with
people of different views.
In addition to discussion
sessions, the students rode in

police cars for a full eight-hour
shift.

SCIRE has also scheduled a
discussion of homosexuality at
8:00 p.m. tonight in the Donner
Lounge. The meeting will be led
by Maud Hamison, a senior in
creative writing. She is a
homosexual who told the Daily,
"By speaking, I'm trying to break
down all the mess people have
about gay women.
"I'm teaching an
Undergraduate Special about the
sex roles people get put into. My
basic philosophy is that there
shouldn't be sex roles. Very
strong roles tend to be destructive
to character."
To see the effects sex roles
have on character, she has had her
class examine the characters in six
books and two plays. "The
stereotypes are more obvious in
literature," Haimson said. "It
reflects the whole social structure.
Most playwrights are men. They
put women in a remarkable
position, but a quite usual one."
She gave Mailer, Wilder, and
Williams as examples of writers
who do this.
"We took two plays "Our
Town" and "A Streetcar Named
Desire," she said, and took scenes
from them and had men play
women, women play men. It
really revealed a lot of the more
subtle aspects of role definition.
"The guys would say things
possible for women, that women
do say, are expected to say, that
for men sound ridiculous." She
said it is more acceptable for

women to be strong than for men
to be subordinate.
Role Reversal
"The best thing was when we
were doing Nightwood. She said,
"a thirties novel about a
homosexual. It shows the position
people have been put in, what we
have been told for so long we are.
It reveals a lot of the prejudices.
The homosexual is supposed to bi
bestial, supposed to be sexually
active, because it is excessive il
goes into decay.
"People have to realize the
effects society has on them. A gay
is told he's immature, psychotic,
erotic, neurotic, frightened of the
opposite sex, narcissitic."
Haimson sees an affinity
between gay lib and women's lib
"Both are fighting the belief that
dominance is necessary, that you
can only establish your identity
by stepping on somebody else.
"A woman has a lot more
purpose than pure sexual
reproduction."
Stud Image
Haimson talked about roles she
believes men are put into. She said
there was a "Fighting, machismo,
stud image of males."
She believes that there are
advantages in being homosexual.
"We've got a lot of freedoms, we
don't have to break downroles."
She is thinking about
organizing a symposium on
homosexuality for the staff and
faculty at Stanford. She
mentioned one that had taken
place recently at Berkeley, and
there have been others on
different campuses. One last April
in Oakland for high school PE and
health teachers was she felt,
particularly good, because the
audience was not afraid to ask a
lot of questions.
Haimson said Stanford has a
reputation of being very hard on
gay people. "So many people are
being damaged by this
university," she said, "this limits
the freedom of many because it
would be very dangerous for them
to admit they're gay. Stanford is
the only at all reputable college
without a homosexuality class."
