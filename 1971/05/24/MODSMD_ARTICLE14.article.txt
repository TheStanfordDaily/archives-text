# Graduates Rate Teaching Central Part Of Education
## 
### KATHY MORTON 
In a recent survey covering
topics from interdisciplinary
work to social contacts with
professors, graduate students have
indicated a marked interest in
teaching as a central element in
graduate education.
The survey conducted by an ad
hoc committee of seven students
and one faculty member, was
compiled last Spring in an effort
to obtain information on graduate
education, not covered in the SES
(Study of Education at Stanford)
report.
"SES didn't do anything on
graduate education," states Keith
Nelson, a faculty member of the
committee.
The committee had no
intentions of implementing
changes, but was merely
interested in compiling
information which would be
useful in departmental reform and
graduate education in general.
In an introduction to the
survey, committee members
Nelson and Grady McGonagill
warn against assuming any
generalities about graduate
education, as the responses are as
varied as the departments.
"Beware of any general trends;
fifty-five departments means
fifty-five response patterns."
The survey does reveal one
general trend, however. Graduate
students have indicated that they
perceive a need for a greater
emphasis on teaching as a major
factor in graduate education.
By contrast, traditional means
of acquiring knowledge, such as
preparing for comprehensive
written and oral exams and
completing courses given by

faculty members, rated quite low.
One question concerning the
future of graduate student
teaching which received
overwhelming favorable response
concerned the establishment of a
Ph.M. program such as Yale's.
The program is for students
who wish to emphasize teaching
rather than research in pursuing
their doctorate. The requirements
are similar to those for a Ph.D.,
minus the dissertation. More than
3/4 of the responses indicated
they were in favor of establishing
such a degree. A little less than
1/4 indicated they not only
favored such a program, but
would participate in it, should it
exist.
Graduates were also asked to

comment on the interest shown
by faculty members in the
development of students as
teachers; 4/ f of the faculty were
rated excellent, 30% declared
"so-so", and 13% abysmal."
However, this low rating is the
lowest in the entire survey.
Students were much more
enthusiastic about their professors
in terms of flexibility granted in
their choice of research topics
other than dissertation research;
67% rated their faculty excellent
or good.
However, the study further
indicated that graduate students
are dissatisfied with both the
quality and quantity of teaching
positions available here at
Stanford; 20% felt that the
opportunities were non-existent.
