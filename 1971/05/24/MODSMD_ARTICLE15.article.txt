# Films Draw To Close; 'High Country' On Tap
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This is the last of my Films on
Campus columns for the year and
really the last significant week for
films at Stanford anyway. There
were so few films scheduled for
last week that a column seemed
unnecessary, but at the last
minute at least four films were
scheduled for the weekend.
Tuesday night Clive Miller will
be showing the film that initiated
critical interest in Sam Peckinpah,
"Ride the High Country." Joel
McCrea and Randolph Scott star
in this beautiful mythic western,
which is paired with "On the
Town," perhaps the epitome of
the American sailor musicals.

Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and
Vera-Ellen star in this entertaining
and innovative film, which was
directed by Kelly and Stanley
Donen.
The final International
Association film of the year is the
celebrated and oft-banned
"Ecstasy," in which Hedy Lamarr
takes her nude swim. On
Thursday at 7:45 in Cubberley.
On Friday, "From Here to
Eternity" will be shown at
Tresidder. This Oscar winner has
certainly lost much of its impact
since 1953, but remains
interesting for the performances
of Montgomery Clift, Frank
Sinatra and Donna Reed.
Next Tuesday, Clive Miller will
be closing out the season with a
momentous double bill, "The
Lady Eve" and "Casablanca."
"Eve" is a bit more lightweight
than other Preston Sturges films,
but is still evidence of Sturges'
genius in his prime. "Casablanca,"
of course, is immortal and
remains, Clive says, "my most
favorite movie."
