# 'Little Prince' Stimulates
## 
### ED HARRIS 
"The Little Prince" which is
playing this week in Branner
Lounge, is an imaginative
free-form adaptation of Antoine
de St. Exupery's children's tale.
The story is a defense of
fantasy, a birthday party for that
childish hedonism which has not
yet learned to be decadent. The
characters move about in an
innocent world which views adult
seriousness as absurd and futile.

John Harvey, who conceived
and skillfully staged this
adaptation, has chosen to dispense
with costumes, sets, and lighting
in order to give a greater freedom
of expression to the actors. By
diminishing the distance between
the actors and the audience he has
created a more personal
relationship between them.
But, as all good existentialists
know, greater freedom implies
greater responsibility; the actors
can no longer rely on the script or
the decor to carry them along or
to create an impression.
Instead of the strict continuity
of a plot we have a series of
expressionistic tableaux in which
all the resources of the actors are
brought into play.
John Harvey's troupe has done
an admirable job in meeting these
responsibilities, yet problems do
remain. The play is performed in
the round, compensating for the
lack of and a stage or lighting to
focus our attention on the playing
space, the actors have to develop a
powerful stage presence.
The acting is inspired, but from
time to time the pace slackened
dangerously. However, I must
admit that this is one of the first
times I have seen actors take full
advantage of performing in the
round, each of them playing
effectively to all sides of the

room. This gives the play a
pulsating rhythm which expands
the contracts instead of the two
dimensional rhythm of
conventional theater which rises
and falls.
Another problem of playing in
the round in this way is that each
actor must project his voice in all
directions and not just forward,
and be able to be heard over the
actors when they are singing or
making noise. At first I had a hard
time hearing many of the lines,
but as the play went on the
diction became clearer.
Also in a play which is
basically unstructured and
depends entirely on expression,
there must be a great precision of
gesture and movement. In this
respect the performance was
occasionally slipshod, lacking that
intensity which draws our
attention and makes us feel the
mood, but on the whole the
childhood atmosphere was
convincingly maintained.
The show is definitely worth
seeing, not only for the delightful
story, but for John Harvey's
original interpretation.
Incidentally, the play is so
free-form it doesn't cost a cent. It
will be performed in the Branner
lounge at 8:30 p.m. every night
through Saturday.

pulsating rhythm which expands
the contracts instead of the two
dimensional rhythm of
conventional theater which rises
and falls.
Another problem of playing in
the round in this way is that each
actor must project his voice in all
directions and not just forward,
and be able to be heard over the
actors when they are singing or
making noise. At first I had a hard
time hearing many of the lines,
but as the play went on the
diction became clearer.
Also in a play which is
basically unstructured and
depends entirely on expression,
there must be a great precision of
gesture and movement. In this
respect the performance was
occasionally slipshod, lacking that
intensity which draws our
attention and makes us feel the
mood, but on the whole the
childhood atmosphere was
convincingly maintained.
The show is definitely worth
seeing, not only for the delightful
story, but for John Harvey's
original interpretation.
Incidentally, the play is so
free-form it doesn't cost a cent. It
will be performed in the Branner
lounge at 8:30 p.m. every night
through Saturday.
"The Little Prince" which is
playing this week in Branner
Lounge, is an imaginative
free-form adaptation of Antoine
de St. Exupery's children's tale.
The story is a defense of
fantasy, a birthday party for that
childish hedonism which has not
yet learned to be decadent. The
characters move about in an
innocent world which views adult
seriousness as absurd and futile.

John Harvey, who conceived
and skillfully staged this
adaptation, has chosen to dispense
with costumes, sets, and lighting
in order to give a greater freedom
of expression to the actors. By
diminishing the distance between
the actors and the audience he has
created a more personal
relationship between them.
But, as all good existentialists
know, greater freedom implies
greater responsibility; the actors
can no longer rely on the script or
the decor to carry them along or
to create an impression.
Instead of the strict continuity
of a plot we have a series of
expressionistic tableaux in which
all the resources of the actors are
brought into play.
John Harvey's troupe has done
an admirable job in meeting these
responsibilities, yet problems do
remain. The play is performed in
the round, compensating for the
lack of and a stage or lighting to
focus our attention on the playing
space, the actors have to develop a
powerful stage presence.
The acting is inspired, but from
time to time the pace slackened
dangerously. However, I must
admit that this is one of the first
times I have seen actors take full
advantage of performing in the
round, each of them playing
effectively to all sides of the

room. This gives the play a
pulsating rhythm which expands
the contracts instead of the two
dimensional rhythm of
conventional theater which rises
and falls.
Another problem of playing in
the round in this way is that each
actor must project his voice in all
directions and not just forward,
and be able to be heard over the
actors when they are singing or
making noise. At first I had a hard
