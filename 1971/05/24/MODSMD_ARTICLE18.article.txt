# 'Toad' Entertains
## 
### LYNN BARRE 
It is a quarter to eight and two
people are sitting in Branner's
dining hall, waiting to see a
production of "Toad of Toad
Hall, A.A. Milne's musical
adaptation of "Wind in the
Willows."
A field mouse scampers over to
ask if we know when the review is
to be done. She is stricken to hear
that this is the night. It can't be,
because we are the only audience
expected, this is the first time
with the orchestra, it is like a
dress rehearsal, etc. These are all
good reasons, and assured that it
won't be reviewed tonight, the
fieldmouse scoots back to director
Michael Barry to reassure him.
The rest of the "unexpected"
audience arrives and the play
begins with the song and dance of
rabbits, mice, weasels and assorted
furry folk.
I realized right away that
whenever the chorus got together
it was going to be great, and it
was. The blocking was a bit
hampered because of the quarters,
but the cast adapted easily, even
to the dogs that occasionally
decided to join the fun.
The most unimaginative person
could have no trouble accepting
Toad Hall, since the costuming
and the set were simple but
effective, and the
characterizations—from the
chattering of the wood animals to
the cocking of Mole's head-were
excellent.

Most notable, of course, was
Toad, who could be recognized
anywhere by his "boop, boop."
Emmitt O'Neil played the
conceited animal, backing him up
were Glen Holland as the ancient,
bowlegged Badger, who knew
Toad's father, his grandfather, and
his esteemed uncle the
arch-deacon; and Bruce Janger's
Rattie, author and performer of
the now-famous "Up Tails All."
My favorite was the timid
Mole, played by Cris Rose. In
addition, the whole cast hams it
up, making "Toad" a very funny
show.
I felt the second act dragged
compared to the first, but lines
must have been memorized and
the pace quickened since opening
night. Reports from Friday and
Saturday nights say some of those
scenes were the funniest of the
play.

"Toad" is a travelling show,
which can be seen at 8:00 p.m.
tonight in the Old Union,
Wednesday at Grove House
outside. Thursday in Roble, and
Friday in Serra. The outdoors
performances are especially
recommended.
The show company-sponsored
is free, but go anyway; you'll love
it.

could have no trouble accepting
Toad Hall, since the costuming
and the set were simple but
effective, and the
characterizations—from the
chattering of the wood animals to
the cocking of Mole's head-were
excellent.

Most notable, of course, was
Toad, who could be recognized
anywhere by his "boop, boop."
Emmitt O'Neil played the
conceited animal, backing him up
were Glen Holland as the ancient,
bowlegged Badger, who knew
Toad's father, his grandfather, and
his esteemed uncle the
arch-deacon; and Bruce Janger's
Rattie, author and performer of
the now-famous "Up Tails All."
My favorite was the timid
Mole, played by Cris Rose. In
addition, the whole cast hams it
up, making "Toad" a very funny
show.
I felt the second act dragged
compared to the first, but lines
must have been memorized and
the pace quickened since opening
night. Reports from Friday and
Saturday nights say some of those
scenes were the funniest of the
play.
"Toad of Toad Hall rates with
Winnie-the-Pooh and Peter Pan,
since 1 found myself in tears at
the end. (Editors Note: The

"Toad" is a travelling show,
which can be seen at 8:00 p.m.
tonight in the Old Union,
Wednesday at Grove House
outside. Thursday in Roble, and
Friday in Serra. The outdoors
performances are especially
recommended.
The show company-sponsored
is free, but go anyway; you'll love
it.
It is a quarter to eight and two
people are sitting in Branner's
dining hall, waiting to see a
production of "Toad of Toad
Hall, A.A. Milne's musical
adaptation of "Wind in the
Willows."
A field mouse scampers over to
ask if we know when the review is
to be done. She is stricken to hear
that this is the night. It can't be,
because we are the only audience
expected, this is the first time
with the orchestra, it is like a
dress rehearsal, etc. These are all
good reasons, and assured that it
won't be reviewed tonight, the
fieldmouse scoots back to director
Michael Barry to reassure him.
The rest of the "unexpected"
audience arrives and the play
begins with the song and dance of
rabbits, mice, weasels and assorted
furry folk.
I realized right away that
whenever the chorus got together
it was going to be great, and it
was. The blocking was a bit
hampered because of the quarters,
but the cast adapted easily, even
to the dogs that occasionally
decided to join the fun.
