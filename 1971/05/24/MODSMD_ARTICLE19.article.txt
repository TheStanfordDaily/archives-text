# Alea II To Open New Music Week
## 
### 
Contemporary Week, sponsored by the ensemble for new music,
Alea 11, will begin Tuesday night with original student and faculty
compositions.
Three concerts, all free, will be presented in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium this week. Programs Tuesday and Friday begin at 8:00
p.m.; Wednesday afternoon's lecture-concert starts at 4:15.
Using everything from wood blocks to computer-generated music,
students have created new sounds and combinations of styles for the
concerts tomorrow and Friday.
Hal Peterson's "The Con Man," which he describes as "a synthesis
of classical, rock and jazz" achieves the combination by shifting
instrumental groupings within the ensemble. Traditional instruments
play in tandem with conga drums and electric piano, guitar and bass.
Peterson composed the music for the Drama Department
production of "Ondine" this year.
Tuesday's audience will hear Paul Fink's "Concerto for Ego and
Orchestra," a short piece for brass, percussion, "ego soloist" and
audience participation.
Martin Bresnick, whose "Ocean of Storms" premiered with the
Symphony Orchestra here on May 23, will offer a choral piece
entitled "Where Is the Way."
One of Prof. Leland Smith's original compositions, "Rhapsody for
Flute and Computer," will be performed Friday night.
Also planned are the student works "Picomotions for Brass," by
Ronald Sverdlove; "Two Madrigals," by Michael Andrews; "Two
Dances," short twelve-tone pieces by Pattie Madsen, and music by
Charles Wolterink, Steve Martin and others.
Karlheinz Stockhausen, the only non-Stanford composer
represented in the contemporary festival, is one of the leading
exponents of new music. His "Refrain" features Charles Dowd,
percussion, David Rada, piano and woodblocks, and Suzanne Beicken,
celeste and antique cymbals.
Alea II is performing group for 20th-century works, especially
"new" (post-1950) music. Directors of the group are two
contemporary specialists from the Music Department facultyâ€”John
Chowning, who teaches percussion, acoustics, and computer music,
and Stephen Albert, teacher of new music and theory and a two-time
winner of the Prix de Rome in composition.
Chowning's research in computer-generated sound will figure in the
Wednesday afternoon lecture-concert. He will play examples of
computer techniques for localizing sound and creating illusory
space that is, generating tones on the computer and making them
seem to originate at a certain point or be arranged in the room in a
certain spatial pattern.
A computer can also "play" a work composed for traditional
instruments and performers, as Prof. Smith will demonstrate with
"Binary Bach," a computer realization of six pieces by J.S. Bach.
Although the computer can be programmed to imitate any
instrument, Smith has juggled musical characteristics to create a few
"nonsuch" timbres, giving Bach's music a different and strangely
modern sound.
Exploration of theatrical elements in music may lead to some
audience participation, Chowning warns. He adds that persons
attending the Tuesday concert are requested to wear hats. No reason
is given.
