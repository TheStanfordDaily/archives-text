# New Quad To Be Built
## 
### GORDON IMRIE 
A new quadrangle, the third on
campus, is now closer to completion as
excavation continues near Meyer
Library for the new Stanford Center
for Research and Development in
Teaching (SCRDT).
The new $8.5 million facility is
scheduled for completion before
Autumn Quarter, 1972. All of the
classroom space in the center will be
devoted to research and development.
Prof. Robert N. Bush, the center's
director, said the new facility will
"observe, record and reproduce the
activities of students and teachers. It
will attempt to delineate the necessary
and appropriate new roles for the
teacher as modern technology moves
into a central place in the schools.
"(The Center) will give us something
we never had before — a laboratory
equipped with the technology of the
1970'5, devoted entirely to the study of
how teaching in schools and colleges

can be improved," he said.
The SCRDT building is planned to
anchor one corner of a new quadrangle
that in addition will include the Post
Office and Bookstore, the proposed
new Law School, Meyer Library and an
as-of-yet unspecified building.
Interior features of the building
include a large TV-film studio, a 3500
square foot research lab, a language lab
area, a library and a "large group
instruction area" seating 158 persons.
The center will consist of two
parallel, three-story buildings with a
skylighted mall between them.
Half of the money for the center
came from the U.S. Office of
Education and the building will be
operated under contract with that
agency.
Much of the building's staff, which
will number nearly 180, will consist of
researchers from the School of
Education and the Departments of
Sociology Linguistics, Physhology and
Economics.
