# Cards Sixth
## Bruins Win Pac-8 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Indian trackmen found out
once again last Saturday why the
Pacific-8 is the strongest
conference in the country. From
their sixth place vantage point in
the meet held at the University of
Washington, the Cards watched
the Bruins edge Oregon and USC
for the Pac-8 crown.
The highlight of the meet for
Stanford was the brilliant three
mile run of All-American Don
Kardong. Steve Prefontaine of
Oregon won the race as expected
but Kardong battled him down to
the tape, losing by only three
seconds and cutting eight seconds
off his life-time best performance
with a 13:20.7. Arvid Kretz took
fourth in the event for the
Indians.
Randy White suffered his first
defeat of the 1971 season in the
440 hurdles as Jim Seymour of
Washington caught White at the
finish to win with the time of
50.9. Seymour avenged a loss to
White earlier in the year on the
same track as the Stanford ace
completed the last race in his
Pac-8 career in a time of 51.1.
Tom Long took sixth in the
intermediates.
The Indian's only other second
place finish was provided by Rick
Tipton in the 120 yard high
hurdles. The expected duel
between Tipton and USC's Lance
Babb did not materialize as Babb

powered to a 13.8 clocking while
Tipton fought off four other
runners who were only a tenth of
a second off his 14.3 clocking.
Tom Anderson put together
the best long jump of his life,
25-2'/2, but it was only good
enough for sixth place in a field
that included defending champion
Henry Hines of USC and Oregon's
Bouncy Moore who upset Hines
to take the 1971 crown with a
jump of 26-6'/2.
Duncan Macdonald held the
lead for most of the mile run, but
a Prefontaine-led caravan of
Ducks paraded by on their way to
a sweep of the event for Oregon.
Prefontaine was timed in 4:01.5
while Macdonald turned in a
4:05.1 for fifth place.
UCLA won the meet with a
total of 126 points by virtue of a
tremendous comeback that caught
the Ducks flatfooted and left
them in second with 117. The
Trojans took third and California
came in fourth while the Indians
wound up in sixth with 36 points.
Oregon dominated the distance
events and the Bruins gathered in
most of the points in the sprints.
The tough competition was
exemplified by the fact that
outstanding Stanford performers
like Casey Carrigan, Allen
Meredith, and Tim Nicholson
were deprived of any placings.
