# Crew Places Sixth In Western Sprints
## 
### SCOTT THACHER 
The varsity and freshman
eights of the Stanford Crew
placed sixth and fifth in their
finals of the Western Sprints held
on Lake Washington in Seattle last
Friday and Saturday. Meanwhile
the University of Washington,
fiercely maintaining its pride in
dominating West Coast crews,
swept away with three victories
against Varsity, J.V., and Frosh
boats from a dozen schools.
A third place in the Friday
morning heat forced the Stanford
Varsity eight into a second heat in
order to qualify for the finals,
where they beat Cal in a photo
finish.
The Stanford-Cal rivalry which
prompted both boats to put in
excellent races, left Stanford too
worn out to perfoim well in the
next day's finals against a
collection of all the crews which
had beaten them this season. They
placed sixth behind Washington,
British Columbia, Loyola, Long
Beach and UCLA.
High hopes for the freshman
boat were dashed by a fifth place
in Saturday's finals behind
Washington, UCLA, Orange Coast
and Loyola. Although Cal trailed
in sixth place, the frosh might

have expected to make third, as
they had beaten Loyola but not
raced Orange Coast.
The Friday morning heat
brought a measure of revenge to
the Junior Varsity boat when they
placed third by turning the tables
on Oregon State. They did not
reach the finals though, and won
the consolation race.
Recently the Stanford boats
have fared roughly since a few
years ago when the first boat beat
Washington State, one of the best
crews going on the Coast.
Crew is not a prestige sport at
Stanford and as a club it receives
only moderate support from the
Atheletic Department. But it is un
fair to say that Stanford suffers
alongside more lavishly
maintained crews, because its
spirit of independence will
probably be an equally important
factor for future success.
