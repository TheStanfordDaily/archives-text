# Indians Knocked Out Of Playoffs
## 
### 
Stanford was eliminated from
the Pac-8 baseball playoffs Friday
by Washington State, 4-2, after
the Indians had dropped the first
game of the day, 9-3, to the
eventual champion, USC. Two
Stanford errorsin the eighth inning
of the second game gave WSU a
3-2 lead which proved
insurmountable.
Stanford had begun the day by
hurling lefty Jim Coate against
USC's ace, Steve Busby. The
Indians had jumped into a 2-1
lead in the third inning on
back-to-back homers by Dave
Edson and Mike Nelson.
After USC had regained a 3-2
lead behind Mike Ball's hitting,
the game remained close until the
eight. The Trojans exploded in
that inning for five runs to put the
game out of reach and hand
Busby his tenth win of the season.
Then in the last game of the
day's tripleheader, Stanford met
the Cougars whom the Cards had
beaten on Thursday, 8-4. Dave
Edson put Stanford ahead in the
first with his fifth home run of
the year, and Mike Nelson drove
in a run in the seventh to give the
Indians a 2-0 lead.

However, the problem which
had bothered Stanford earlier in
the day, struck with a vengeance
in the eighth. WSU pinch hitter
Chuck Hawthorne was safe on an
error and was driven home by Bob
Waites who scored the tying run
from third on a wild throw to the
plate.
A sacrifice fly drove home the
winning run and Waites scored an
insurance run in the ninth to nail
hard luck pitcher Bruce Schoen
with his fourth loss. Schoen only
gave up one earned run, but the
four Stanford miscues added the
rest.
WSU went on to upset USC,
10-5, in the first game on
Saturday, but the Trojans came

back in the second game of the
day to take the Cougars and the
championship, 6-3.
Bobby Waites, who later
received the most valuable player
award for the tournament, forced
the playoffs into the extra game
by slamming two homers for WSU
in the first game 10-5 win.
USC will now meet the winner
of the Santa Clara-San Jose State
NCAA district playoff. Santa
Clara took the first of the three
game series with San Jose, 5-0, on
Sunday. The winner of this
match-up, which in all likelihood
will be USC, then travels to the
College World Series in Omaha,
Nebraska.
