# Politicization Hit

W. Glenn Campbell director of the
Hoover Institution thinks that the
nation's colleges are too concerned
with the world's ills and not paying
enough attention to teaching and
research.
A member of the University of
California Board of Regents, Campbell
urges our universities to get back to the
historic function of academics lest they
become hopelessly "politicized" by
their pursuit of social and political
action. "They have tried," he asserts,
"with distinct lack of success to solve

all the nation's problems, ranging from
the war in Vietnam through the
problems of the cities."
Campbell was especially critical of
the "character assasination that takes
place on American campuses
today. . . the reckless charges of
profiteering, war mongering, racism,
imperialism, genocide and other high
crimes and misdemeanors." — a "verbal
pollution" he says which makes "the
behavior of the late senator from
Wisconsin, Joseph McCarthy, seem like
a kindergarten excercise."
