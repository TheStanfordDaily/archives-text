# Excess Freedom Causes Unrest
## 
### 
In a speech delivered Saturday to
the Stanford Alumni Association's
Campus Conference, President Richard
Lyman told how proliferating freedoms
may contribute to uneasiness among
the young and lead people to seek
authoritation relief from the problems
of choice.
Lyman spoke specifically of how
four freedoms—travel, religion, culture
and education—have contributed to
unrest among youth who are searching
for an escape from the anguishing
experience of making a choice.
Citing Eric Fromm's book, Escape
From Freedom, he spoke about "our
frequent human tendency to huddle
together, even to accept dictatorship
and totalitarian systems as preferable to
enduring the agonies of choice and the
adjustments required of us when other
people, having values different from
our own, possess the same freedom that
we do."
"Advanced in travel throughout the
world "add up to a virtual revolution in
attitudes toward homes and hearth,"
Lyman said.

"Religious options, which have
probably been increasing gradually for
centuries, have in this century
multiplied with bewildering speed."
"Freedom of speech and political
association has gone so far that no
subjects are beyond the pale and
organizations proliferate so fast and so
casually that often one does not know
what they represent or whom," Lyman
added.
But Lyman connected the spread of
these freedoms with increased unrest
among young people. "Mobility has
increased, but at a real cost in sense of
belonging, in sense of identification
with one place or region.
Cultural choice is enormous, but so
much so the choosing itself becomes an
agony, something one would rather not
think about.
"Freedom of speech, of association,
of confrontation are more widespread
than ever, but the thrill of exercising
these freedoms does subside after a
time. When the ground is then surveyed
in search of concrete gains achieved
through their exercise, the results are
often discouraging," Lyman further
stated.
"As for education, everyone agrees
that freedom has not brought
satisfaction. Indeed, one may ask
whether abandonment of the effort to
prescribe any common basis of general
education in college hasn't left a
vacuum, as much moral and spiritual as
educational.
"But universities do not exist for the
purpose of saving souls or
single-mindedly remodeling the world.
They exist to help people, in the ways
that education can help, to decide
whether their souls need saving and if
so how to do it, whether the world
needs remodeling and if so how to do
it."
