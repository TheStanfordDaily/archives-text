# Stanford Summary

### 
Students Sentenced
Three law students who blocked the
San Jose Draft Board offices in San
Jose last month were ordered to pay a
$50 fine last Thursday in San Jose
Municipal Court. The three, Nick
Dreher, Mick Goldstein, and Greg
Melchor, refused to pay a fine and will
serve five days in jail instead. Ten
others had previously been placed on
summary probation in connection with
the same incident.
In a statement to Judge Louis Doll,
Goldstein argued that the court should
"take into account what we did and
what we were trying to help halt. No
one now claims that the war is anything
more than a tragic mistake.
Therefore-though the President wants
the war to continue for a timeâ€”it is to
be done with a minimum of further
American casualties. By replacing men
with bombs and slowly withdrawing
ground troops, he will reach that
minimum by the time he must face the
voters. Yet he has also made it clear
that he will prolong the agony long
enough so that the Saigon generals need
not come to terms with their popular
and powerful opponents until after the
presidential election here. Thus Mr.
Nixon intends to have his cake and eat
it too, though it be drenched in the
blood of thousands more Americans
and an even greater number of Asians."
One hundred sixty students at the
law school have signed a statement
endorsing the action of the defendants.
Solomon Appointed
Ezra Solomon, professor of finance
has been appointed to President
Nixon's Council of Economic Advisors.
He will replace Hendrick Houthakker,
who will return to the Harvard faculty
on July 1, after 2 1/2 years on the
council. He has angered representatives
of the copper, oil, gas, and steel

industries by his public criticism of
some of their practices.
Solomon, 51, has been Dean Witter
professor of finance here since 1965,
and for the four previous years was
director of the University's
International Center for the
Advancement of Management
Education.
During an earlier tenure in the
University of Chicago Graduate School
of Business, Solomon was a colleague
of George P. Schultz, director of the
Office of Management and Budget and
considered the most influential White
House advisor on economic issues.
Professor Solomon is the author of a
number of important books, including
"Money and Banking" and"The
Theory of Financial Management."
