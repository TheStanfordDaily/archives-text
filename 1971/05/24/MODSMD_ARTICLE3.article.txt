# SWOPSI And SCIRE: Autonomy?
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Quite simply, it's a question of CUS
and the ODUS agreeing with the policy
boards of SWOPSI and SCIRE on a
charge for the future which will also
pass the CoC Senate. In other words,
what follows is a case study of
bureaucracy, Stanford—style.
But behind all of the administrative
maneuvers of the group's listed above
lies the very real problem of future
prospects for SCIRE and SWOPSI,
Stanford's experiments in
student-initiated education.
The conflict is between the
"autonomy" of SWOPSI and SCIRE as
"student centers" part of campus
operations, according to SCIRE
Director Lana De Salvo.
Since fall, 1969, more than 2,000
students have taken courses sponsored
by the Stanford Workshops On Political
and Social Issues (SWOPSI). SWOPSI's
courses, taught by non-faculty
volunteers under faculty sponsors, are
designed by students to tackle
"revelant" issues.
The Stanford Center for Innovation
in Research and Education (SCIRE) has
enrolled more than 455 students in
special projects since its start last
spring. SCIRE concentrates on helping
students put together independent and
small-group projects in any field of
study.
Established Place
Dean of Undergraduate Studies

James Gibbs (DUS) said SWOPSI and
SCIRE have now "established a place in
the University." But he said that also
means they have become
"administrative offices" which must
make their peace with the University
administration.
SWOPSI and SCIRE clearly come
under the "area of concern" of the
Office of the Dean of Undergraduate
Studies (ODUS), according to Gibbs.
Although the programs were begun
before his position was established,
Gibbs said, "It was clear in the
(Academic) Senate's mind" from the
start that his office would supervise
SWOPSI and SCIRE.
Although those in charge of the
programs have accepted some
supervision by Gibbs as inevitable, De
Salvo said they have resisted becoming
just "a Dean's advisory group." The
biggest issue has been exactly how
Gibbs will be involved in the process
which grants academic credit to
SWOPSI and SCIRE projects.
SCIRE and SWOPSI supporters say
they most feared Gibbs would seek
direct veto power over the credit
proposals. But Gibbs insisted that he
never wanted more than the limited
involvement provided in the
compromise plan he, SWOPSI, and
SCIRE now endorse.
The compromise would preserve the
present credit-granting machinery.
Proposed courses would be approved
bv the "Policy Boards" of SWOPSI and

SCIRE, which have student majorities.
They would next be reviewed by the
supervising Committee on
Undergraduate Studies (CUS), also
numerically dominated by students.
Review Committee
The only new step would be a
"review committee," which would
check any credit plans questioned by
either Gibbs or the CUS chairman. The
committee, appointed by CUS — met
by Gibbs, as the programs' supporters

feared would include 4 faculty
members, 2 students and an ex-office
member from Gibb's office.
Gibbs said the compromise would
allow him a "close consulting
relationship" without "bruising the
programs." SCIRE's De Salvo agreed
the proposal does not "compromise
away the essence" of SCIRE and
SWOPSI as centers for student
innovation.

WERE YOU THERE?—Nobody really knows why Carlos Santana, Ruddy Miles, and Co. dropped into Frost yesterday, but
over 9,000 people can swear that it actually happened. Coming at the tail end of the afternoon concert sponsored by
"Education As Awareness" Santana flashed new material for most of an hour but finished with a slightly incredible version of
'Soul Sacrifice.' Then came drummer Buddy Miles and 4 5 minutes of a cookin' jam session-highlighted by Mr. Miles,
Santana's new second lead guitarist can you believe 16 years old and some fine trumpet and sax. By the way, see you at the
Dead concert Friday and Saturday.
