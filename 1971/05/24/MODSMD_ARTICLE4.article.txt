# 'Daily Cal' Hopes For Compromise Solution
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Editors of the Daily Californian will
enter into negotiations with the paper's
publishing board this morning, in an
attempt to reach a compromise
solution allowing the student
newspaper to finish its publication
schedule this spring.
The publishing board delivered an
ultimatum to the paper last Thursday
giving it till noon today to publish
without three editors fired last
Tuesday, or face suspension of
publication.
The editor's proposal hinges on
keeping the three fired editors on the
staff while a new editprial board is
trained. The results of elections for a
new editor-in-chief and editorial page
editor — who will serve as the nucleus
of the new editorial board — will be
announced this morning.
The new editor will take office May
29, the day after the Daily Cal's last
issue for the spring is published.
A further suggestion of the editors is
that the University withdraw funds
from the paper for this last week of
publication, or until the Daily Cal staff
informs the publisher's board of new
editorial board's installment.

The Daily Cal editor-in-chief and
editorial page editor are elected by the
entire staff; the city editor and
managing editors are appointed by the
incoming editor. The lower staff
representative is elected by the lower
staff after a new editor has taken
office. These five comprise the paper's
editorial board.
David Dozier, editorial page editor
and one of the three editors fired
following the publication two weeks
ago of an editorial urging the retaking
of People's Park, stated last night that
the paper could fund its own
publication for the remaining four
issues with advertising revenue or with
its $200 reserve fund.
"Our primary consideration (in the
negotiations) is keeping the paper going
and to go independent as soon as
possible," Dozier stated.
He added that, if the publishing
board rejects the proposal and the
negotiations break down, publication
for the remainder of the year would
most likely be suspended. The Daily
Cal this year has been making efforts to
become independent of the University
and the student government as soon as
possible.
