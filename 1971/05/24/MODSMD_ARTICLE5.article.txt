# IRS After Telephone Tax Evaders
## 
### CARLA KALLAN 
Students who have protested the
Vietnam war by withholding payment
of the federal tax on their telephone
bills, may find their past efforts voided
by the recent action of the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS).
The IRS has been serving some 12
notices of levy per month for the
nonpayment of telephone taxes, to the
Student Accounting Office of the
university. Rather than immediately
attaching student accounts, the office
referred the entire matter to Noel
Fletcher of the Controller's staff for
consideration.
Fletcher, after studying the form,
determined that the IRS has legal
authority to attach any funds "due and
payable" to an individual. This includes
payroll, funds on deposit with the
university, accounts payable to
individuals, and some scholarships. The
IRS also seems to be focusing on
personal bank accounts of students in
the area.
The most fruitful target for the IRS,
however, may be the $50 housing
deposit, since it is universally required
of each student living within the
housing system. This deposit could be
attached at the time it is "due and
payable" to the student, which is when
he leaves university residences.

The entire operation is costly and
inconvenient for just about everybody.
According to Fletcher, the university
spends some $10 in processing costs in
attaching the property of each student.
"If we had a legal option, we wouldn't
do this," he commented. "We can't
afford to throw away monev."
It is also a nuisance to the IRS. "An
agent may work all day to collect some
$3," Fletcher said. "My impression is
that the operation is being conducted
without enthusiasm."
The IRS is spending much more
than it is collecting, which "raises the
question of the sanity of the tax
division," commented Assistant Dean
of Students William Stone.
The Pacific Telephone Company,
alone, is "off the hook." The only
money that it stands to lose is a
minimal expense needed for additional
clerical functions.
Local manager Jeff Wilkes,
explained that Pacific Telephone does
not function as a collection agency for
the ten percent tax. Rather, it is "an
accounting system for the
government." It maintains records of
those who do not pay the tax, and their
reasons, and sends this list to the IRS.
It has no responsibility to secure
payment.

It takes several months, or even a
year, for the IRS to process each levy
in the case of nonpayment of the
phone tax. There are no available
estimates on the number of students
involved in this war protest.
But a recent incident demonstrated
that the Stanford community is
definitely not alone. On May 12,
Franklin Jack Burr Jr., half-owner of an
Indian handicraft shop in San Anselmo,
discovered that Wells Fargo Bank had
deducted $10.48 from his account. He
soon learned that $2.98 had been

deducted as the tax from his phone bill,
and that $7.50 was a service charge by
the bank.
Burr stormed out, but later returned
and attempted to hold up the bank for
$10.48. After a brief scuffle, Burr was
taken to the psychiatric ward of Marin
General Hospital.
Burr was booked on charges of
attempted robbery and assault and
battery. Later these were reduced to
battery and disturbing the peace. He is
nowfree on $250 bail.
