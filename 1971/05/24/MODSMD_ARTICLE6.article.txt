# RESEARCH FORUM

### 
The issue of research policy has been the object of
heated debate and sometimes violent conflict at Stanford.
The April 3rd Movement of 1969 coalesced around the
issues of counter-insurgency, classified and other
war-related research. This controversy led to the Applied
Electronics Laboratory sit-in, the Encina sit-in and the
SRI Hanover demonstrations. On a more positive note,
A3M also led to the adoption by the Academic Senate of
guidelines for classified research.
Subsequent demonstrations and investigations prove
that many questions concerning the proper stance of the
University with regard to research are still unanswered. Of
special note is a committee of the Academic Senate, headed
by Dr. Joshua Lederberg of the Department of Genetics,

which will submit its report on research policy at the
Senate meeting.
The columns published in today's Forum hardly begin
to touch the extent of viewpoints and considerations that
must be examined in formulating a policy on University
Research. Not considered, for example, are the political
effects on peoples of the Third World of economic and
sociology research done at Stanford.
It is obvious that any action taken by the Academic
Senate in response to the report of the Lederberg
Committee could have far-reaching consequences. All
members of the Stanford Community must consider the
implications of adopting any policy on research.
