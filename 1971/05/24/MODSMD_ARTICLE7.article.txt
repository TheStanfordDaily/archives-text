## U.S. Policy Determines Application 
###

The issue of university research
policy—particularly on Department of
Defense contracts-is a complex one
that precludes blanket statements. For
example, the opponent of all DOI)
research must recognize that the
Navy-sponsored shock recovery
experiments here have little anti-life
potential and in fact may save many
highway accident victims. To even hope
to make honest decisions, the Stanford
community has to take a hard look at
the myths and realities surrounding
campus research.
One prevalent myth is that science is
a world in itself, outside and above
society. In fact, people make scientific
discoveries, people apply those
discoveries to further their interests,
and people are inevitably affected by
discoveries and applications. The
scientist exists in the context of his
society; it is inconceivable that he be
considered apart from it. Nor is
technology good or evil per se; politics
determines whether knowledge will
mean increased human welfare or
destruction, oppression, and murder.
The moral man must consider scientific
questions within their political context.
Consequently, the scientist must
consider not only the technical results
of his work but how the power
structure will define its meaning in
society. The history of the laser,
developed in university labs on DOD
contracts, clearly demonstrates this.
The laser has great potential in surgery
and in pollution control; it also has
myriad military uses and is already
being used very successfully in bombing
runs over Indochina. Since our
imperialist elite sees its own interests
served more by bombing Asians than
by those applications which would
benefit the groat majority of people, it
is not surprising that the nation spends
seven times more on military lasers
than on peaceful uses. In the
never-never land of "disinterested"
study, the laser is considered a
politically neutral advance of man's
knowledge; in the real world, it is
anything but neutral. And we- like the

Vietnamese who are being bombed
more effectively than before- live in
the real world.
Intellectual Curiosity
Most researchers can honestly and
sincerely claim that their personal
involvement stems from intellectual
curiosity. This does not change the
objective fact that in effect they allow
their intellects and work to be
channeled by the military. Refusal to
face the concrete effects of one's
actions is frighteningly irresponsible
when the stakes are so high.
The Artificial Intelligence Study
(AIF) is an illustration. (I chose this
one because it is not intrinsically evil,
unlike obviously militarized projects
like the one to improve eye protection
for pilots making nuclear strikes.)
Last month, AIP was linked with the
Electronic Battlefield (EB) program in
an article in Washington Monthly.
Leonard Sullivan, top technology man
for Vietnam, sums up the EB concept:
"When one realizes that we can detect
anything that perspires, moves, carries
metal, makes a noise, or is hotter or
colder than its surroundings, one begins
to see the potential. This is the
beginning of the instrumentation of the
entire battlefield." This is no fantasy;
many components are already in the
field. In General Westmoreland's
words: "With cooperative effort, no
more than 10 years should separate us
from the Automated Battlefield."
Pressures Resisted
The AIP person I talked to
disclaimed any knowledge of a
connection between the project and
Electronic Battlefield but stated that
the project did have obvious military
uses (among others). He felt that the
predominately anti-war research group
resisted what he termed light DOI)
pressures but that DOI) did in effect set
parameters on experimental
applications.
Two uses for the project's findings

are apparent at this point. One is
helping autistic children (not
DOD-funded); the other is military. In
strict technical terms, they may be
equal. If we ask what the actual use will
be, the only honest answer is that the
major use will probably be by the
ruling class in places like Vietnam. The
corporate elite and its military machine
simply have more political power than
autistic kids do, regardless of
researchers' desires.
Should one continue research with
the knowledge that his work will have
military as well as socially useful uses,
and that in the present
political-economic context the
destructive potential of his work will
much more likely be realized than will
the humane possibilities? Many think
not, especially in view of Defense
Research and Development Director
John Foster's detailed accounts of how
basic research and development areas
have been and are vital to the U.S.
effort in Vietnam. He considers
university research essential to the
Pentagon.
'Free University'
The "free university" is perhaps the
prime defense of DOD contracting. In
essence, it is a social contract that "you
can do your thing and I can do mine."
But consider what DOD's thing is. If
Foster is correct about the importance
of R&D in Vietnam, then we are
legitimizing the killing of these people
if we accord DOD the right to follow
its present course. And of course DOD
research is not the advocacy of ideas; it
is simply building a technological base
for the use of force.
President Lyman once proposed that
instead of attacking research, dissidents
should change the system and thus
change the direction of research.
Unfortunately, the U.S.'s imperialist
policy has been and is in the interests
of America's ruling class, and so they
are not very open to persuasion. The
alternative—forcible revolution

appears impossible in the forseeable
future. Lyman is right about final goals.
But with scant hope of soon changing
research by radically changing society,
we are still left with the fact that most
DOD research can be expected to hurt
people and we still face the question of
how we will respond.
This is not advocacy of a particular
program or an expose of AIP. It is too
easy for a history major with nothing
to lose to demand Draconian measures
for DOD-supported researchers. Still, I
hope that we will be able to make a
realistic analysis of this very
"un-neutral" work and eventually
implement higher values than the
Pentagon's.
(Guy Whitehead is a junior history
major with nothing to lose.)
