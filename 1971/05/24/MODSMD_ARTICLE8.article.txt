## Research And Teaching 
### 
Robert L white

One frequently hears the argument that Stanford would
be a much better educational institution it the faculty
would quit their research and turn their energies to
teaching. Iti my opinion, this argument has some
considerable merit in a purely undergraduate institution,
but totalk unsupportable in an institution which has
graduate education as ;i major component of its educational
thrust.
1 wish to argue that research at the graduate level, at
least in the iences and engineering, is primarily a teaching
activity. and is a teaching activity of the type toward which
most educational reform is directed; a small-numbers,
intense-interaction affair.
A primary consideration in the selection ol research
projects for proposal to the various funding agencies is that
the research have a substantial educational component.
Any research which does not have as a major objective the
training of graduate students has no place on campus.
Identity Problems
The training of a graduate student means teaching him
to identify and define problems, to formulate elfective
attacks upon the problems selected, and to recognize the
context and implications of solutions which may emerge.
Training a graduate student implies sensitizing him to
observe the unexpected, perhaps unwanted, data that turns
up. and teaching him to be willing to accept that data as
lust valid and compelling as the hoped for data.
The thesis supervisor often initiates problems in the
sens* that he directs the graduate student's attention to a
problem or an area in which problems exist but almost
never, within my experience, truly formulates the thesis
research in any detail. This failure to think the thesis
problem through is not a derelection of duty on the part of
the advisor, for him to do so would emasculate the thesis
research as a learning experience for 'he student.
No Lackey
There is a tendency for those not involved with thesis
research to think of the graduate student as a lackey, as
cheap labor set to carrying out relatively automatically or
mindlessly the calculations or experiments masterminded
and controlled by his advisor. Within the research format
with which I am familiar, graduate students supported

directly on their thesis research by grants or contracts, this
is virtually never the case. I would say that the converse
case is more common; most graduate students shudder
when their advisor approaches their apparatus lest he
dabble with something he doesn't understand. That, too, I
would argue is proper, for the advisor's function is
generally advice on general principles, not detailed
supervision on daily routines.
The advisor should understand the thesis area
thoroughly. He should not allow the student to work on a
problem which is trivial, or which has been done, or which
is nearly done somewhere else, or on a problem which is
insoluble, or on one where prior work indicates the answer
is very probably negative. lie should be aware, as the
student cannot be expected to be, of previous work in the
relevant area, of the implication of work in peripheral areas
for the thesis research, and vice versa. He has strong and
binding responsibilities as a supervisor, and should argue
out with his student the proposed course of action and
conclusions as they shape up I lis relationship, however, is
not that of foreman to workman: his relationship is that of
teacher to student.
Major Complaint
A major complaint against the large university is the
depersonalization of the teaching. Though the
depersonalization can occur in the lecture context, it is all
but impossible in the thesis research context. Here there are
small numbers of people involved; at most a handful ol
graduate students per faculty members, and I ear assure
you that each graduate student is a distinct personality of
his thesis advisor.
In summary, I wish to present the proposition that the
supervision of thesis research is not only a form ol
teaching, but is teaching in one of its most personal and
intensive forms. There are fringe benefits to lecture
teaching derived from participation in active research, but I
would argue that these are indeed fringe benefits, and that
the direction of thesis research is a primary and important
teaching activity in itself
