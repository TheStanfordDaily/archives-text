## Is Your Research Moral?

Nowadays science and scientists are
being attacked from all directions. On
the one side there are those in congress,
the military and the general public who
say that, if science were doing what is
expected, it would have won the war in
Vietnam and produced horrible new
weapons to terrify all possible enemies.
On the other side many students and
intellectuals, even including some
scientists, say that if scientists were
doing their job properly, they should
have produced an end to poverty,
racism, air pollution, over-population
and war. Strangely, both opposed
groups of critics argue that since
science has not performed according to
their specifications, either scientsts are
misdirecting their efforts or perhaps
science is irrelevant and has little to
contribute to the solution of important

human problems. Both groups equally
fail to understand the real nature of
scientific discovery and the ways in
which scientific knowledge eventually
makes possible the goals people desire.
A fuller understanding of nature is
esthetically pleasing and deeply
satisfying, but its social significance
comes because it is also useful. It makes
us prophets so that we and our
successors can predict what can happen
and can even tell something of the
consequences that will follow if we
make something occur. Part of the
attraction of physics is that simple laws
and concepts have extremely
far-reaching consequences and apply in
a very wide range of situations. It is for
just this reason that the ultimate
applications of physical discoveries are
almost never apparent at the beginning.
Let me give two examples from
relatively recent technological history.
The first I know personally, for when
Townes and I were trying in 1957 to
see whether the maser principle could
yield a generator of coherent radiation
in or near the range of visible
wavelengths, we gave almost no
thought to applications. I had never
heard of a detached retina, and yet one
of the earliest applications of lasers was
for eye surgery to prevent retinal
detachment. Although lasers are still
quite primitive and many of the more
obvious applications remain
impractical, they have been applied to a
wide range of needs, most of which
could hardly have been foreseen except
by a person who specialized in the
particular area of application. But if we
had tried to attack these needs head on,
as might have been done by a specialist
in eye surgery, we would never had
been thinking about stimulated
emission from atomic systems.
Considerably more important
consequences have come from Felix
Bloch's discovery' of the concept of
energy bands in solids and their
influence on conduction of electricity.
In the twenty years after Bloch's 1928
thesis, the band ideas guided the whole
development of solid state physics. And

yet, as late as 1953, twenty five years
after the discovery, one could have said
truthfully that these ideas had not led
to greatly improved metals nor to any
other important practical
consequences. But a year or so later,
there began serious applications of the
transistor.
Now, the impact of the use of
transistors and other semiconductor
devices on human life is already
enormous. To take a few examples,
there are cardiac pacemakers and the
Ã¼biquitous transistor radio which is
playing such an important role in
unifying some developing countries.
Without semiconductor devices the
entire space program would be nearly
impossible.
None of this could possibly have
been foreseen at the time of the
original scientific discover}'. Yet from
all our experience we should have faith
that scientific ideas do have
consequences, important consequences
which greatly increase the range of
decisions that man can make.
It is the nature of man to make
choices and to master his environment.
With science and its consequences we
have the tools to make decisions, good
or bad. If we sacrifice scientific
research for immediate social gains, we
might have a short range benefit but we
are surely mortgaging our future.
After applications of science become
apparent, the people and their
representatives must decide whether
the applications are good or bad. Here
scientists must play a part by sharing
knowledge of the possible courses and
their likely consequences. If the facts
are known, we can be optimistic that
the people will more often chose
courses to their own benefit than the
reverse. Every thinking scientist must
have faced this question and concluded
that, broadly, scientific discoveries do
eventually open up badly needed
alternatives from which more good
than evil will be extracted.
