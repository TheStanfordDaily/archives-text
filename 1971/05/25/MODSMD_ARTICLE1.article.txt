# SCIRE Authority May Be Lessened Under New Plan
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS) has recommended that
the Faculty Senate renew the SCIRE
(Student Center for Innovation in
Research and Education) "mandate for
one year under a revised charter. . . "
But it is still unclear as to what
changes the revised charter will include.
CUS has said they will present a
detailed charge to the Faculty Senate at
a future meeting.
At the same time, the Faculty
Senate's Committee on Committees
(CoC) has recommended that, under a
new charge, the CUS establish for no
longer than one year "no more than
three Special Joint Agencies of (CUS)
and Dean of Undergraduate Studies" to
deal with extra-departmental courses
and projects based on student
initiation, normal activities of SCIRE.
Evidently, the CoC proposal, if
approved, will take away from SCIRE
the administrative responsibilities it has
had this year and give them to the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies. SCIRE will
then set policy and the Dean will
enforce that policy in individual cases if
the proposal is approved.
For example, SCIRE—or the agency
of the CUS—would set policy on
granting credit for student-initiated
workshops and courses and the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would
evaluate the individual proposals
according to that policy.

During the past academic year
SCIRE has had both the administrative
and policy setting functions.
"Veto Power"
Some critics of this proposal feel
that any change such as this would give
the Dean "veto power" over student
proposals. They feel the idea behind
SCIRE was to allow a committee with a
majority of students to grant credit for
student-initiated proposals.
Supporters of the revised charge
point out that when SCIRE was formed
the Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies had not yet
been created and that the CUS was
given, for a one year period only, both
administrative and policy-setting
responsibility.
They also urge that the authority of
the Academic Senate over credit be
maintained through the CUS and say
that in any proposals for granting
credit, the faculty has always
maintained its ultimate authority.
Both the report of the CUS on
SCIRE and the COC charge to the
Committee on Undergraduate Studies
will be considered at this Thursday's
Faculty Senate meeting.
In a report to the Faculty Senate on
SCIRE, the CUS praises the
committee's efforts "to enable students
to develop their own individual and
group projects as well as small group
courses and to receive credit for these

activities" and adds, "SCIRE is playing
an important role in the development
and facilitation of innovation in
undergraduate studies at Stanford."
The report also recommends that
under the revised charter for SCIRE, its
activities come "under the guidance of
the Dean of Undergraduate Studies."
How much guidance is the question
that has been bothering some SCIRE
supporters. As reported in yesterday's
Daily a compromise plan reportedly
calls for a "review committee"
appointed by the CUS to check any
credit plans approved by SCIRE but
questioned by the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies or Chairman of
the CUS.
The CUS report on SCIRE praises
"the significant progress" the policy
board has made in spite of the
difficulty of maintaining its full
complement of 11 members. According
to the report, more than 850 students
have participated in some 104 courses
or projects of the Center during its
five-quarters of operation.
But there have been problems in
SCIRE's actions, according to the
report. SCIRE's flexibility has caused
problems in its relationship with
established departmental
undergraduate degree programs, the
report noted, and such problems should
be examined.
The CUS urges SCIRE to "assess" its
activities "in order to present them to
the departments for consideration as
part of the regular undergraduate
curriculum."
Also, the CUS feels "SCIRE must
improve its publicity to reach a broader
spectrum of the student body than has
been the case so far." Finally, the
report says "an approach to the
evaluation of innovation itself must be
made in order to develop guidelines
concerning the nature of those
activities that SCIRE can properly and
successfully develop in the University."
The CUS feels that the Dean's Office
can "contribute both organizationally
and intellectually to the development
of SCIRE's activities." Furthermore,
" . . . SCIRE can benefit
administratively from closer
cooperation and integration with the
ODUS (Office of the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies)."
SCIRE was formed in January, 1970
by the Faculty Senate and began its
operations in earnest in Spring Quarter,
1970. It was to "be concerned with the
implementation of student-designed
innovations in undergraduate
education" and as a subcommittee of
the CUS was given special power to
grant academic credit with certain
restrictions.
The Student center was proposed by
the ASSU Council of Presidents during
the 1969-70 academic year and has
operated with virtual autonomy on an
experimental basis this current
academic year.
