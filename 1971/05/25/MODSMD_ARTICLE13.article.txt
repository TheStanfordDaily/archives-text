# More Female Profs Asked

The nation's most respected
universities should "provide
examples for their young women
students" by hiring more female
professors, especially on a
part-time basis, according to
economist and educational
administrator Rita R. Campbell of
Stanford's Hoover Institution.
These universities, Dr.
Campbell believes, have "failed
miserably" to consider this
emulative aspect in women's
choices of life paths:
"Less than three percent of
their tenured faculties [are]

women, married or single.
"Because of the prestige of
these universities they attract the
brightest of our young women
and yet by mere example it is
made clear to them that a
professional career on the one
hand and marriage and children
on the other are separate paths,
and only in exceptional
circumstances is it possible to
combine them."
Mrs. Campbell cited Harvard
University's plans for "part-time
faculty appointments and
part-time graduate study which
will enable women with family

responsibilities to pursue scholarly
careers."
She noted that giving them the
"lreedom of choice" to combine
careers with motherhood "does
not mean that women in the
future will hold an equal
percentage with men of high-pay,
career-type jobs. Many capable
women having favorable economic
circumstances choose not to
work; many do volunteer work
and follow creative pursuits of
their own."
"Women," she concluded,
"will not even begin to improve
their economic rewards until they
enter in larger numbers the higher
paying fields." And, significantly,
"the numbers of women working
part time have been increasing
much faster than the number of
full-time women workers."
