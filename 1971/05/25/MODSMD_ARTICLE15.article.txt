John Kerry, leader of Vietnam
Veterans who protested in
Washington during recent anti-war
activities will be speaking in
Memorial Auditorium on
Thursday evening, June 3.
The former lieutenant testified
extensively before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee in
late April.
Kerry holds three Purple
Hearts, the Bronze Star and the
Silver Star. He was wounded three
times in Vietnam and thus was
allowed to return to duty in the
United States in 1969.
