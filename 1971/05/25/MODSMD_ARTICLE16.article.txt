# 'Rascals' Progress To Mellower Music
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Progression is a word often heard in rock music
circles. In a strictly musical sense it refers to a
succession of tones or chords. But it also refers to
how groups move forward and mature. And how
they avoid the security trip of remaining in a
successful vein and instead, change and experiment.
Naturally the Beatles come to mind first when
talking about progressive groups. Possibly the most
successful group of all time, they were not willing to
rest on their laurels and just keep cranking out
million-sellers. They kept moving and experimenting
and finally split up when they had gone as far as
they thought they could as a four-man group.
To mention the Rascals, formerly the Young
Rascals, in the same breath as the Beatles may seem

to some a grave sacrilege of rock music. I might have
thought so myself until I heard the Rascals new
double album and one of their shows last weekend
at Fillmore West.
No one would claim that the Rascals could ever
move as far forward as the Beatles. The creativity
and musical genius of those four Englishmen may
never be matched in rock music. But the Rascals
have come a long way since their younger days.
Began In 1965
The Young Rascals began to be recognized in the
summer of 1965 when they played to packed
houses in New York. Their sound was characterized
as "blue-eyed soul and rhythm and blues." They
played classic R&B hits such as "Mustang Sally"
and "In the Midnight Hour" and soon produced a
number of single hits including "Good Lovin'," "I've

Been Lonely Too Long" and"I Ain't Gonna Eat
Out My Heart Anymore."
But as time went by they began to move forward
from the strictly hit-45 scene. They discarded the
knickers and Lord Fauntleroy look which had been
one of their early trademarks. They moved into a
little more meaningful music such as their beautiful
"People Got To Be Free" which represented one of
the high points of their career.
But now the Rascals have done a little more than
produce a worthwhile single Two of the original
members, Gene Cornish and Eddie Brigati have left
the group and a number of new people have been
added, increasing the group's size to seven. They
have gotten into a much mellower and less harsh
sound and are playing a more R&B/jazz type of
music.
Cavaliere Continues
Organist vocalist Felix Cavaliere is still the
central figure of the group. He still writes almost all
of their material and is usually the lead singer. His
distinctive pleading, soulful voice is one of the few
reminders of the old Rascals.
Two of the additions to the group are female
vocalists, Ann Sutton and Molly Holt, who offset
Cavaliere nicely. The new bass player, Robert
Popwell is a veteran studio musician. His solos
indicate that he deserves a little more recognition
than his name on the liners of albums.
Now when they play old songs like "Mustang
Sally," "I've Been Lonely Too Long" and "People
Got To Be Free" they play them with an easier, less
intense sound. A lengthened and more instrumental
version of "People ..." was one of the highlights of
Saturday's show.
'Peaceful World'
As is traditional, the Rascals played a number of
selections from their new "Peaceful World" album
(Columbia—G3o462). It is an easy-listening album
which you can play for quite a while without tiring
of it. It has some beautiful instrumentation and the
lyrics are much more meaningful and full-bodied
than in previous albums.
The Rascals played a number of cuts off it
including "Love Me," a nice introduction to the
new sound of two female vocalists and "Love
Letter" a strong sensual song which has received
some local FM radio airplay.
Unfortunately they neglected to play what I
consider to be two of the finest cuts on the
album—"ln and Out Of Love," a lovely blues

selection written by guitarist Buzzy Feiten and
"Little Dove," a very beautiful number which
includes the unique sound of a harp, an instrument
heard rarely in rock music.
Gauguin Cover
The album is climaxed by a 21-minute title song
which demonstrated all the varied sounds and areas
the new Rascals have moved into. The album cover
has a lovely Paul Gauguin picture on it which
accentuates the title perfectly and which is a
refreshing change from the
Let's-stage-a-picture-with-the-whole-group cover
routine.
Preceding the Rascals on the Fillmore bill were
two relatively unknown groups, Grootna and Grin,
both of whom showed some strong promise. Grin is
a three man group composed of some people who
played formerly with Neil Young. Nils Lofgren is a
strong lead guitarist who does some good
Hendrix-Winter type work.
The group did an outstanding encore of
"Smokestack Lightning" and might do well.
Lofgren's voice was a bit fuzzy in person, but on
their first album, "Grin" (Spin Dizzy Z20321), he
sounds much clearer and gives indications of
becoming one of the better new guitar-vocalists.
Grootna Sounds Good
Grootna is a six-member group 1 heard earlier
this year with Santana. They feature a female lead
singer who looks a bit like Bobbie Gentry and who
sings in the style of Lydia Pense from Cold Blood.
She has a fine voice and is particularly impressive in
sensual selections such as "You're Driving Me
Crazy" and the old Tina Turner classic, "Crazy Bout
You Baby."
Grootna also has an amazing guitarist who is
skinny, incredibly limber and loose as a rubber
goose. He is another one of those unique musicians
who can boogie while playing. He is featured on
some Elvin Bishop-type boogie numbers including
"Can't Get No Nookie" an outstanding ballad about
some woman who told her frustrated lover to cran
it.
The whole bill was greatly aided by the fact that
none of the groups felt the necessity of throwing in
a five-minute drum solo, which has become an all
too often part of every show. The audience was
strangely mellower than usual and maybe with more
shows like this, rock's leading entrepeneur, Bill
Graham, might reconsider and keep Fillmore open
past this fall.

knickers and Lord Fauntleroy look which had been
one of their early trademarks. They moved into a
little more meaningful music such as their beautiful
"People Got To Be Free" which represented one of
the high points of their career.
But now the Rascals have done a little more than
produce a worthwhile single Two of the original
members, Gene Cornish and Eddie Brigati have left
the group and a number of new people have been
added, increasing the group's size to seven. They
have gotten into a much mellower and less harsh
sound and are playing a more R&B/jazz type of
music.
Cavaliere Continues
Organist vocalist Felix Cavaliere is still the
central figure of the group. He still writes almost all
of their material and is usually the lead singer. His
distinctive pleading, soulful voice is one of the few
reminders of the old Rascals.
Two of the additions to the group are female
vocalists, Ann Sutton and Molly Holt, who offset
Cavaliere nicely. The new bass player, Robert
Popwell is a veteran studio musician. His solos
indicate that he deserves a little more recognition
than his name on the liners of albums.
Now when they play old songs like "Mustang
Sally," "I've Been Lonely Too Long" and "People
Got To Be Free" they play them with an easier, less
intense sound. A lengthened and more instrumental
version of "People ..." was one of the highlights of
Saturday's show.
'Peaceful World'
As is traditional, the Rascals played a number of
selections from their new "Peaceful World" album
(Columbia—G3o462). It is an easy-listening album
which you can play for quite a while without tiring
of it. It has some beautiful instrumentation and the
lyrics are much more meaningful and full-bodied
than in previous albums.
The Rascals played a number of cuts off it
including "Love Me," a nice introduction to the
new sound of two female vocalists and "Love
Letter" a strong sensual song which has received
some local FM radio airplay.
Unfortunately they neglected to play what I
consider to be two of the finest cuts on the
album—"ln and Out Of Love," a lovely blues

selection written by guitarist Buzzy Feiten and
"Little Dove," a very beautiful number which
includes the unique sound of a harp, an instrument
heard rarely in rock music.
Gauguin Cover
The album is climaxed by a 21-minute title song
which demonstrated all the varied sounds and areas
the new Rascals have moved into. The album cover
has a lovely Paul Gauguin picture on it which
accentuates the title perfectly and which is a
refreshing change from the
Let's-stage-a-picture-with-the-whole-group cover
routine.
Preceding the Rascals on the Fillmore bill were
two relatively unknown groups, Grootna and Grin,
both of whom showed some strong promise. Grin is
a three man group composed of some people who
played formerly with Neil Young. Nils Lofgren is a
strong lead guitarist who does some good
Hendrix-Winter type work.
The group did an outstanding encore of
"Smokestack Lightning" and might do well.
Lofgren's voice was a bit fuzzy in person, but on
their first album, "Grin" (Spin Dizzy Z20321), he
sounds much clearer and gives indications of
becoming one of the better new guitar-vocalists.
Grootna Sounds Good
Grootna is a six-member group 1 heard earlier
this year with Santana. They feature a female lead
singer who looks a bit like Bobbie Gentry and who
sings in the style of Lydia Pense from Cold Blood.
She has a fine voice and is particularly impressive in
sensual selections such as "You're Driving Me
Crazy" and the old Tina Turner classic, "Crazy Bout
You Baby."
Grootna also has an amazing guitarist who is
skinny, incredibly limber and loose as a rubber
goose. He is another one of those unique musicians
who can boogie while playing. He is featured on
some Elvin Bishop-type boogie numbers including
"Can't Get No Nookie" an outstanding ballad about
some woman who told her frustrated lover to cran
it.
The whole bill was greatly aided by the fact that
none of the groups felt the necessity of throwing in
a five-minute drum solo, which has become an all
too often part of every show. The audience was
strangely mellower than usual and maybe with more
shows like this, rock's leading entrepeneur, Bill
Graham, might reconsider and keep Fillmore open
past this fall.
Progression is a word often heard in rock music
circles. In a strictly musical sense it refers to a
succession of tones or chords. But it also refers to
how groups move forward and mature. And how
they avoid the security trip of remaining in a
successful vein and instead, change and experiment.
Naturally the Beatles come to mind first when
talking about progressive groups. Possibly the most
successful group of all time, they were not willing to
rest on their laurels and just keep cranking out
million-sellers. They kept moving and experimenting
and finally split up when they had gone as far as
they thought they could as a four-man group.
To mention the Rascals, formerly the Young
Rascals, in the same breath as the Beatles may seem

to some a grave sacrilege of rock music. I might have
thought so myself until I heard the Rascals new
double album and one of their shows last weekend
at Fillmore West.
No one would claim that the Rascals could ever
move as far forward as the Beatles. The creativity
and musical genius of those four Englishmen may
never be matched in rock music. But the Rascals
have come a long way since their younger days.
Began In 1965
The Young Rascals began to be recognized in the
summer of 1965 when they played to packed
houses in New York. Their sound was characterized
as "blue-eyed soul and rhythm and blues." They
played classic R&B hits such as "Mustang Sally"
and "In the Midnight Hour" and soon produced a
number of single hits including "Good Lovin'," "I've

Been Lonely Too Long" and"I Ain't Gonna Eat
Out My Heart Anymore."
But as time went by they began to move forward
from the strictly hit-45 scene. They discarded the
knickers and Lord Fauntleroy look which had been
one of their early trademarks. They moved into a

than in previous albums.
The Rascals played a number of cuts off it
including "Love Me," a nice introduction to the
new sound of two female vocalists and "Love
Letter" a strong sensual song which has received
some local FM radio airplay.
Unfortunately they neglected to play what I
consider to be two of the finest cuts on the
album—"ln and Out Of Love," a lovely blues

selection written by guitarist Buzzy Feiten and
"Little Dove," a very beautiful number which
includes the unique sound of a harp, an instrument
heard rarely in rock music.
Gauguin Cover
The album is climaxed by a 21-minute title song
which demonstrated all the varied sounds and areas
the new Rascals have moved into. The album cover
has a lovely Paul Gauguin picture on it which
accentuates the title perfectly and which is a
refreshing change from the
Let's-stage-a-picture-with-the-whole-group cover
routine.
Preceding the Rascals on the Fillmore bill were
two relatively unknown groups, Grootna and Grin,
both of whom showed some strong promise. Grin is
a three man group composed of some people who
played formerly with Neil Young. Nils Lofgren is a
strong lead guitarist who does some good
Hendrix-Winter type work.
The group did an outstanding encore of
"Smokestack Lightning" and might do well.
Lofgren's voice was a bit fuzzy in person, but on
their first album, "Grin" (Spin Dizzy Z20321), he
sounds much clearer and gives indications of
becoming one of the better new guitar-vocalists.
Grootna Sounds Good
Grootna is a six-member group 1 heard earlier
this year with Santana. They feature a female lead
singer who looks a bit like Bobbie Gentry and who
sings in the style of Lydia Pense from Cold Blood.
She has a fine voice and is particularly impressive in
sensual selections such as "You're Driving Me
Crazy" and the old Tina Turner classic, "Crazy Bout
You Baby."
Grootna also has an amazing guitarist who is
skinny, incredibly limber and loose as a rubber
goose. He is another one of those unique musicians
who can boogie while playing. He is featured on
some Elvin Bishop-type boogie numbers including
"Can't Get No Nookie" an outstanding ballad about
some woman who told her frustrated lover to cran
it.
The whole bill was greatly aided by the fact that
none of the groups felt the necessity of throwing in
a five-minute drum solo, which has become an all
too often part of every show. The audience was
strangely mellower than usual and maybe with more
shows like this, rock's leading entrepeneur, Bill
Graham, might reconsider and keep Fillmore open
past this fall.
Progression is a word often heard in rock music
circles. In a strictly musical sense it refers to a
succession of tones or chords. But it also refers to
how groups move forward and mature. And how
they avoid the security trip of remaining in a
successful vein and instead, change and experiment.
Naturally the Beatles come to mind first when
talking about progressive groups. Possibly the most
successful group of all time, they were not willing to
rest on their laurels and just keep cranking out
million-sellers. They kept moving and experimenting
and finally split up when they had gone as far as
they thought they could as a four-man group.
To mention the Rascals, formerly the Young
Rascals, in the same breath as the Beatles may seem

to some a grave sacrilege of rock music. I might have
thought so myself until I heard the Rascals new
double album and one of their shows last weekend
at Fillmore West.
No one would claim that the Rascals could ever
move as far forward as the Beatles. The creativity
and musical genius of those four Englishmen may
never be matched in rock music. But the Rascals
have come a long way since their younger days.
Began In 1965
The Young Rascals began to be recognized in the
summer of 1965 when they played to packed
houses in New York. Their sound was characterized
as "blue-eyed soul and rhythm and blues." They
played classic R&B hits such as "Mustang Sally"
and "In the Midnight Hour" and soon produced a
number of single hits including "Good Lovin'," "I've

Been Lonely Too Long" and"I Ain't Gonna Eat
Out My Heart Anymore."
But as time went by they began to move forward
from the strictly hit-45 scene. They discarded the
knickers and Lord Fauntleroy look which had been
one of their early trademarks. They moved into a
little more meaningful music such as their beautiful
"People Got To Be Free" which represented one of
the high points of their career.
But now the Rascals have done a little more than
produce a worthwhile single Two of the original
members, Gene Cornish and Eddie Brigati have left
the group and a number of new people have been
added, increasing the group's size to seven. They
have gotten into a much mellower and less harsh
sound and are playing a more R&B/jazz type of
music.
Cavaliere Continues
Organist vocalist Felix Cavaliere is still the
central figure of the group. He still writes almost all
of their material and is usually the lead singer. His
distinctive pleading, soulful voice is one of the few
reminders of the old Rascals.
Two of the additions to the group are female
vocalists, Ann Sutton and Molly Holt, who offset
Cavaliere nicely. The new bass player, Robert
Popwell is a veteran studio musician. His solos
indicate that he deserves a little more recognition
than his name on the liners of albums.
Now when they play old songs like "Mustang
Sally," "I've Been Lonely Too Long" and "People
Got To Be Free" they play them with an easier, less
intense sound. A lengthened and more instrumental
version of "People ..." was one of the highlights of
Saturday's show.
'Peaceful World'
As is traditional, the Rascals played a number of
selections from their new "Peaceful World" album
(Columbia—G3o462). It is an easy-listening album
which you can play for quite a while without tiring
of it. It has some beautiful instrumentation and the
lyrics are much more meaningful and full-bodied
than in previous albums.
The Rascals played a number of cuts off it
including "Love Me," a nice introduction to the
new sound of two female vocalists and "Love
Letter" a strong sensual song which has received
some local FM radio airplay.
