# 'Bananas': Flawed, But Funny
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Woody Allen's "Bananas" is
probably the most laugh-infested
film since Woody Allen's "Take
the Money and Run." Though
Woody has clearly circumvented
the sophomore jinx, what
appeared to be minor
inadequacies in his debut promote
near-major reservations about his
present effort.
Allen's comic style has
remained quite consistent since
his days as king of the cellar night
club circuit without developing
significantly.
His forte is still verbal rather
than visual virtuosity. A scene in
which a newly-ascended
revolutionary leader of a tiny
Latin American country- proclaims
Swedish as the national language
is merely one of dozens of
possible examples of Allen's still
fertile imagination for the
exclusively verbal joke; the
physical gags don't come off
nearly so well unless used in
tandem with dialogue. (One
striking exception to this is the
sight of our hero bound and
gagged at his trial.)
Nightclub Routines
Allen occasionally translates
portions of his nightclub routines
into sequences for his films. In
"Take the Money and Run,"he
recreates the image of chain gang
convicts escaping posing as an
immense charm bracelet.
In "Bananas," an early scene
shows the meek Woody, who has
just screwed up the courage to
buy a dirty magazine, mocking
and then being terrorized by two
gruesome thugs. This a variant on
another of his monologues.
As for Allen's own appearance,
he seems just as anxious here as he
did in his Broadway play, "Play It
Again, Sam," to play upon his
fantasy of Woody as the World's
Greatest Lover.
Silly Putty
What this amounts to is a self
conscious facade of mince-meat
machismo built upon a foundation
of Silly Putty, as Woody is only
able to satisfy the girl he loves
once he has donned the garb of a
Castro-like figure. The women in
Woody's world are precisely
idealized to serve his projected
self, as they are pretty,
self-sacrificing, generous, endlessly

understanding and hopelessly in
love.
Despite all the laughter,
"Bananas" seems somewhat
insubstantial and unsatisfying
almost instantly after it is over. I
think the basic problem with the
structure that causes the entire
film to seem more lightweight
than it is lies in Allen's shotgun
use of gags as opposed to a
developed, inter-related use of
them. There must be two or three
hundred gags throughout the
film's eighty minutes, but they are
mostly disconnected, having little
or nothing to do with anything
else in the film.
Keaton And Chaplin
The genius of Buster Keaton
lay in his consistent ability to
build gags one on top of another,
to make them flow naturally in
order to tell the story, yet to time
them tightly enough so that they
were still unpredictable and
funny.
Allen seems much closer to
Keaton than to Chaplin in his
comic orientation, though he tries
to have it both ways when he
plays the romantic scenes for all
the pseudo-Chaplinesque comic
pathos he can. In these scenes, he
comes across as a mischievous
puppy trying to make up to his
master by acting mournful but
guiltless.
This would normally be fine,
but these are the only scenes in
which Woody seems to take his
own character seriously and he
frames the shots so tightly that we
are almost asked to believe the
action, which constitutes a
temporary violation of the comic
environment and a feeble attempt
to introduce drama into the
proceedings.
Comic Conception
What Woody Allen does have is
a very accurate notion of what
screen comedy is all about, and
this is something no other
American comic has had in years,
at least since the disintegration of
the studio system. As Chaplin
wrote on the subject of movie
comedy, "nothing transcended
personality," and Allen is smart
enough to keep his comic persona
consistent.
Not only does Allen always
play himself, but Howard Cosell

makes a memorable screen debut
playing himself. "Bananas" gives
no evidence that Woody Allen has
begun to work out the few
creative problems he does have,
but at least he's keeping us
laughing, which is something very
few people seem able to do these
days.

physical gags don't come off
nearly so well unless used in
tandem with dialogue. (One
striking exception to this is the
sight of our hero bound and
gagged at his trial.)
Nightclub Routines
Allen occasionally translates
portions of his nightclub routines
into sequences for his films. In
"Take the Money and Run,"he
recreates the image of chain gang
convicts escaping posing as an
immense charm bracelet.
In "Bananas," an early scene
shows the meek Woody, who has
just screwed up the courage to
buy a dirty magazine, mocking
and then being terrorized by two
gruesome thugs. This a variant on
another of his monologues.
As for Allen's own appearance,
he seems just as anxious here as he
did in his Broadway play, "Play It
Again, Sam," to play upon his
fantasy of Woody as the World's
Greatest Lover.
Silly Putty
What this amounts to is a self
conscious facade of mince-meat
machismo built upon a foundation
of Silly Putty, as Woody is only
able to satisfy the girl he loves
once he has donned the garb of a
Castro-like figure. The women in
Woody's world are precisely
idealized to serve his projected
self, as they are pretty,
self-sacrificing, generous, endlessly

understanding and hopelessly in
love.
Despite all the laughter,
"Bananas" seems somewhat
insubstantial and unsatisfying
almost instantly after it is over. I
think the basic problem with the
structure that causes the entire
film to seem more lightweight
than it is lies in Allen's shotgun
use of gags as opposed to a
developed, inter-related use of
them. There must be two or three
hundred gags throughout the
film's eighty minutes, but they are
mostly disconnected, having little
or nothing to do with anything
else in the film.
Keaton And Chaplin
The genius of Buster Keaton
lay in his consistent ability to
build gags one on top of another,
to make them flow naturally in
order to tell the story, yet to time
them tightly enough so that they
were still unpredictable and
funny.
Allen seems much closer to
Keaton than to Chaplin in his
comic orientation, though he tries
to have it both ways when he
plays the romantic scenes for all
the pseudo-Chaplinesque comic
pathos he can. In these scenes, he
comes across as a mischievous
puppy trying to make up to his
master by acting mournful but
guiltless.
This would normally be fine,
but these are the only scenes in
which Woody seems to take his
own character seriously and he
frames the shots so tightly that we
are almost asked to believe the
action, which constitutes a
temporary violation of the comic
environment and a feeble attempt
to introduce drama into the
proceedings.
Comic Conception
What Woody Allen does have is
a very accurate notion of what
screen comedy is all about, and
this is something no other
American comic has had in years,
at least since the disintegration of
the studio system. As Chaplin
wrote on the subject of movie
comedy, "nothing transcended
personality," and Allen is smart
enough to keep his comic persona
consistent.
Not only does Allen always
play himself, but Howard Cosell

makes a memorable screen debut
playing himself. "Bananas" gives
no evidence that Woody Allen has
begun to work out the few
creative problems he does have,
but at least he's keeping us
laughing, which is something very
few people seem able to do these
days.

Correction: "Ecstasy" will be
screened on Wednesday at 7:45
p.m. in Bishop Auditorium, not
Thursday as reported in
yesterday's film summary.

Woody Allen's "Bananas" is
probably the most laugh-infested
film since Woody Allen's "Take
the Money and Run." Though
Woody has clearly circumvented
the sophomore jinx, what
appeared to be minor
inadequacies in his debut promote
near-major reservations about his
present effort.
Allen's comic style has
remained quite consistent since
his days as king of the cellar night
club circuit without developing
significantly.
His forte is still verbal rather
than visual virtuosity. A scene in
which a newly-ascended
revolutionary leader of a tiny
Latin American country- proclaims
Swedish as the national language
is merely one of dozens of
possible examples of Allen's still
fertile imagination for the
exclusively verbal joke; the
physical gags don't come off
nearly so well unless used in
tandem with dialogue. (One
striking exception to this is the
sight of our hero bound and
gagged at his trial.)
