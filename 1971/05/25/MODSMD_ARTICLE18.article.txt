SOLEDAD — Forty of Soledad Prison's toughest convicts
were forcibly routed from their maximum security cells
with the aid of tear gas and moved to other state prisons
Saturday, it was disclosed yesterday.
Another 30 from the general prison population,
designated as "disruptive" after reviews of their files, were
transferred peacefully Saturday morning, prison officials
announced.
At the same time it was announced that on Saturday
evening, after the moves, guard Yoshynobu Teruya, 41,
suffered a minor abdominal wound when attacked by a
presoner to whom he was serving food in the maximum
security wing.
Vietnamese Attack
SAIGON — North Vietnamese assault troops, attacking in
darkness under cover of a mortar barrage, struck at an
encampment of American armored cavalrymen near Saigon
early today but were repulsed, the U.S. Command
reported.
It said eight American soldiers were killed and nine were

Chattanooga Riot Death
CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. (AP) — A 22-year-old Negro man
was shot to death by police Monday night in a fourth night
of Chattanooga disorders that had resulted in 2,000
National Guardsmen being called in.
Except for the shooting, however, police said violence
had subsided Monday compared to the three previous
nights of disorders, which largely had occurred in Negro
sections.
All incoming commercial airline flights were cancelled
from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m., said Phil Maxwell, chief of the
Federal Aviation Administration control tower at the
airport.
This period coincided with a countrywide curfew.

Maxwell said all aircraft were warned to avoid flying over
downtown Chattanooga because Guard helicopters, flying
without lights, would be patrolling the city.
The two battalions of guardsmen from East Tennessee
moved in with fixed bayonets during the early morning
hours Monday on orders of Gov. Winfield Dunn, after
smouldering racial tension was triggered by failure of a
black soul singer to perform at a scheduled concert Friday.
"Bringing the National Guard ain't gonna help a bit,"
one beret-wearing Negro told a friend in the heart of the
black business district. "I've been watching them National
Guard trucks and 1 haven't seen a black man yet.
