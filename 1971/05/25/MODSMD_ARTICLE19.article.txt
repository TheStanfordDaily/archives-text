# New Editors Take Over Daily Cal; Paper To Continue Publication
## 
### FRED MANN 
In an informal meeting with its Publisher's
Board yesterday, the Daily Californian staff
voted to allow a newly appointed editorial board
to take over immediate control of the paper.
The editors had previously hoped to delay
the official takeover by the new board until
after Friday, the last day of publication for the
paper this quarter.
The decision, expected to be approved by the
Publisher's Board this morning, means today's
paper and the three more after it will be under
the direction of the editorial board normally
elected to serve for a year starting in the
summer.
This satisfies the ultimatum delivered by the
Publisher's Board last Thursday stating that the
three editorial board members responsible for
the publication of a front page editorial calling
for the retaking of People's Park be removed
from office by noon yesterday, or publication
would be halted.
The three, Managing Editor James Blodgett,

Editorial Page Editor David Dozier, and Lower
Staff Representative Fran Hawthorne will all
remain on the paper in positions other than
those of editors. Only Dozier will graduate in
June.
Editor-in-Chief John Emshwiller, who
resigned in protest over the controversy will also
remain in a non-editorial position.
The fifth member of the old editorial board,
City Editor Trish Hall is the only one to
continue in her capacity as a member of the
newly installed board.
Hall remarked last night that the Daily Cal
staff was divided as to whether or not the
compromise decision could be viewed as a
victory for the paper.
She stated the paper hopes to become
independent of all University and student
government control by the beginning of
September, and therefore would most likely not
be faced with any similar problems in the future.
The newly elected editor is Toni Martin,2o, a
junior and former managing editor.
