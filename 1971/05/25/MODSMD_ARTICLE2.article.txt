# Advisory Board Meets On Date For Franklin
## 
### JONATHAN DEDMON 
The Faculty Advisory Board will
meet Wednesday afternoon at 1:00
p.m. to discuss a date to hear charges
against suspended English Professor H.
Bruce Franklin.
Thus far no official date has been set
for the case of the controversial Maoist
Melville scholar whom President Lyman
suspended last February 12. Franklin
faces possible dismissal.
At tomorrow's meeting the Advisory
Board—the seven man faculty group
hearing Franklin's case - will hear
arguments from the Administration's
and Franklin's counsels when the
Marxist professor's hearing should take
place. Following the meeting, the
Board will decide upon an appropriate
time for the hearing.
Franklin is currently seeking a
continuance of the case until early fall
quarter, claiming that "it's important
for students to see what's going on. It's
far more educational than some of the
things that pass for classes."
Franklin charges that the
Administration has "stalled" his case

until a time when students are busy or
on vacation.
"They said their counsel was
unavailable until mid-May, which was a
stall on their part," Franklin explains.
"Now they're trying a big rush so that
the hearing will be at a time when
students are very busy or until June or
July when no students are here."

the unavailability of Franklin's
attorney, Michael Kennedy, has been
the main reason for the hearing's delay.
The Administration had proposed
today as the date when the hearing
should begin.
However, Franklin's attorney is
abroad until June 13, and the Advisory
Board has indicated that because
Franklin is currently without his
counsel, "some" postponement in the
case is indicated."
In other matters concerning the case
a petition is being circulated on campus
asking that Franklin's case be
continued until the fall. It states, "In
the interests of fairness and
responsibility, we urge that the hearings
of the Advisory Board on the Bruce
Franklin matter be deferred until early
in Fall Quarter so that students and
faculty may have an unrestricted
opportunity to consider the details and
ramifications of this extremely
important case."
