# Art Students Sleep-In For Classes
## 
### LYNNE JONES 
Six students "slept-in" in the lobby
of the Cummings Art Building Sunday
night. There were no arrests, and no
injuries. The act, one which has taken
place every quarter for the past year,
was apolitical. But it occurred for good
reason.
If you've ever decided to take a
basic studio art course, you'll
understand why the hard tile floor has
became a popular sleeping place.
There is one, and only one, way to

get the jump on hoards of other latent
artists for the few places open to
non-art majors in the introductory
course of your choice: get in line the
night before pre-reg and stay there until
morning.
"I've been trying for three quarters
to get into an art course here," said one
bleary-eyed senior who had just
survived the ordeal. "Last quarter there
were already about 70 people in line
for photography at 6:30 in the
morning. So I decided to sleep in
overnight."
This quarter there were only about
20 people in line when sign-ups started.
According to Acting Department
Chairman Albert Elsen, "Spring
pre-registration is light because people
figure out they still have a chance. Fall
and winter quarters are hell. We have
kids signing between the lines."
The Art Department is painfully
aware of its inability to meet student
demand for studio courses. Elsen says
simply, "There isn't any money."
Last quarter the department made
their plight graphically clear to the
controllers of the purse strings. They
sent xerox copies of the waiting lists
for studio courses and photographs of
their lobby full of sleeping students to
the office of the Dean of Humanities
and Sciences.
A demand for studio art courses is a
particularly hard one to meet. About
half of the Art professors are on the
studio side of the Department, but they
cannot hope to teach as many students
as the art historians. Unlike lecture
classes, a studio course demands that
the professor work with every student.
"Forty students a week is all they can
handle, according to Elsen.

Every quarter a major effort is made
to fund studio courses, but the
prospects are not getting any better.
Elsen admits that, "There is a
possibility that there might be no
photography course next year."
The people who spent Sunday night
on the floor might not be happy to
hear that.
