# YR Impeachment (?) Causes Stir
## 
### TONY BOLLEN 
The newly-elected President of
Stanford Young Republicans, Noel
Casey, may be on the verge of
impeachment by a Young Republican
Executive Board. Casey claims the
board is powerless because it was never
actually appointed.
The impeachment move came during
a noon meeting at the Business School
yesterday, when liberal former YR
President Roman Buhler and four other
members of the organization voted
Casey—along with YR Vice president
Nick Neubauer—out of office.
Buhler contends the four members
who voted in favor of impeachment
had been appointed to the
organization's Executive Board only
moments before by Casey himself, a
contention which Casey vigorously
denies.
Roman's Word
"I was forced to take Roman's word
as to who were members and who
weren't," said Casey. "He knows the
members better than I do." But the
four who voted Casey out of office,
Casey reiterated, "were not appointed"
to the Executive Board, which holds
impeachment powers.
(The Board, as defined by the YR
Constitution, includes all present
officers, the past president- Buh
ler—plus four appointed members.)
Casey, a business school student, a
"Nixon-Republican," and former
Membership Chairman of the Stanford
Republican group, was elected YR
President last Thursday night, defeating
both moderate Republican Dan Hall,
and Barry Whitesides, a supporter of
Republican anti-war Congressman Pete
McCloskey.

According to Buhler, Casey's recent
charge that McCloskey "unwittingly
echoes the Soviet position on
Indochina" convinced the liberal
Republican faction that Casey's
presidency "is neither proper nor in the
best interests of the organiza
tion"—hence the impeachment action.
Getr Together?
Casey claims yesterday's meeting
was merely an unofficial get-together,
while Buhler contends it was an official
Executive Board meeting called by
Casey himself.
Buhler and the four club members
were present when Casey, Vice
President Neubauer, and Treasurer

Peter Brimelow came in. A
conversation ensued, during which,
Buhler says, Casey appointed the four
YR's whom Casey did not know to the
Executive Board.
Buhler then immediately introduced
a resolution calling for Casey's
impeachment, the disputed members
and Buhler voted in favor of removing
Casey from office.
Casey, Neubauer, and Brimelow,
however, did not vote, and quickly left
the meeting. Had they stayed and voted
against impeachment, Buhler said, the
measure might have failed to receive
the two-thirds majority required by the
YR Constitution, but, as it was, the 5-0
vote sufficed—provided that the

Executive Board was really the
Executive Board, which Casey says it
wasn't.
The Young Republican's
Constitution requires a second vote of
the Executive Board for impeachment
to become final. This vote is slated for
next Tuesday, June 1.
Conservatives Upset
Ed Jagels, a Casey supporter and
member of the Free Campus
Movement, said yesterday,"The
conservative contingent will get rather
upset when they hear about this."
Both Buhler and Casey denied the
conflict is caused by any deep
personality clash. Casey, Buhler said,
wants to "use the office (of president)
to say things that just don't represent
the .opinions of the membership." He
cited Casey's statement about
McCloskey, calling it "an irresponsible
attack on a Republican Congressman."
"I support all Republicans ard
always have," Casey stated.
What will happen now regarding
Casey's "impeachment"?
Casey discounted the whole issue as
"sheer nonsense," "a very foolish
action that can only hurt the club,"
and says he hopes there will be no YR
split. But Buhler feels a power struggle
is "inevitable"; regarding a split, he
added, "If Casey wants to start a
competing club, he'll have to work his
ass off."
The vital question centers on
whether yesterday's four votin (
Executive Board members were or were
not properly appointed. The answer
will shape the politics of the Young
Republicans at Stanford, a group with
considerable influence in the YR
statewide organization.

members better than I do." But the
four who voted Casey out of office,
Casey reiterated, "were not appointed"
to the Executive Board, which holds
impeachment powers.
(The Board, as defined by the YR
Constitution, includes all present
officers, the past president- Buh
ler—plus four appointed members.)
Casey, a business school student, a
"Nixon-Republican," and former
Membership Chairman of the Stanford
Republican group, was elected YR
President last Thursday night, defeating
both moderate Republican Dan Hall,
and Barry Whitesides, a supporter of
Republican anti-war Congressman Pete
McCloskey.

According to Buhler, Casey's recent
charge that McCloskey "unwittingly
echoes the Soviet position on
Indochina" convinced the liberal
Republican faction that Casey's
presidency "is neither proper nor in the
best interests of the organiza
tion"—hence the impeachment action.
Getr Together?
Casey claims yesterday's meeting
was merely an unofficial get-together,
while Buhler contends it was an official
Executive Board meeting called by
Casey himself.
Buhler and the four club members
were present when Casey, Vice
President Neubauer, and Treasurer

Peter Brimelow came in. A
conversation ensued, during which,
Buhler says, Casey appointed the four
YR's whom Casey did not know to the
Executive Board.
Buhler then immediately introduced
a resolution calling for Casey's
impeachment, the disputed members
and Buhler voted in favor of removing
Casey from office.
Casey, Neubauer, and Brimelow,
however, did not vote, and quickly left
the meeting. Had they stayed and voted
against impeachment, Buhler said, the
measure might have failed to receive
the two-thirds majority required by the
YR Constitution, but, as it was, the 5-0
vote sufficed—provided that the

Executive Board was really the
Executive Board, which Casey says it
wasn't.
The Young Republican's
Constitution requires a second vote of
the Executive Board for impeachment
to become final. This vote is slated for
next Tuesday, June 1.
Conservatives Upset
Ed Jagels, a Casey supporter and
member of the Free Campus
Movement, said yesterday,"The
conservative contingent will get rather
upset when they hear about this."
Both Buhler and Casey denied the
conflict is caused by any deep
personality clash. Casey, Buhler said,
wants to "use the office (of president)
to say things that just don't represent
the .opinions of the membership." He
cited Casey's statement about
McCloskey, calling it "an irresponsible
attack on a Republican Congressman."
"I support all Republicans ard
always have," Casey stated.
What will happen now regarding
Casey's "impeachment"?
Casey discounted the whole issue as
"sheer nonsense," "a very foolish
action that can only hurt the club,"
and says he hopes there will be no YR
split. But Buhler feels a power struggle
is "inevitable"; regarding a split, he
added, "If Casey wants to start a
competing club, he'll have to work his
ass off."
The vital question centers on
whether yesterday's four votin (
Executive Board members were or were
not properly appointed. The answer
will shape the politics of the Young
Republicans at Stanford, a group with
considerable influence in the YR
statewide organization.

IMPEACHED?—NoeI Casey, Nixon-Republican, was impeached yesterday by the
Young Republican Executive Board—or so says Roman Buhler, past YR President
and spearhead of the impeachment move. Casey tells a different story • that the
group that impeached him was not the Executive Board at all.
The newly-elected President of
Stanford Young Republicans, Noel
Casey, may be on the verge of
impeachment by a Young Republican
Executive Board. Casey claims the
board is powerless because it was never
actually appointed.
The impeachment move came during
a noon meeting at the Business School
yesterday, when liberal former YR
President Roman Buhler and four other
members of the organization voted
Casey—along with YR Vice president
Nick Neubauer—out of office.
Buhler contends the four members
who voted in favor of impeachment
had been appointed to the
organization's Executive Board only
moments before by Casey himself, a
contention which Casey vigorously
denies.
Roman's Word
"I was forced to take Roman's word
as to who were members and who
weren't," said Casey. "He knows the
members better than I do." But the
four who voted Casey out of office,
Casey reiterated, "were not appointed"
to the Executive Board, which holds
