# ASSU Special Election
## Vote On KZSU, Legal Aid 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
Initiatives calling for student levies
to support KZSU and "Legal Offense,"
an ASSU-incorporated organization,
will appear on the ASSU special
election ballot this Wednesday and
Thursday.
KZSU. the campus radio station, is
seeking a one dollar per student special
assessment during Autumn Quarter
1971-1972.
Will Pape, KZSU station manager,
wrote in a letter to the Daily published
last Friday, "Wednesday and Thursday
of next week (May 26 and 27) the
students of the University will decide
whether KZSU .. . will be able to
continue effectively its role in the
community."
According to Pape, the initiative was
made necessary by the zero dollar
ASSU fee assessment passed by the
student body in April. KZSU currently
receives money from the Student
Senate. Advertising revenues from the
AM portion of the station have
dwindled, adding to their financial
bind.
"Severely Impaired"
"If the students do not vote to
finance the station, its operation will be
severely impaired," stated Pape's letter.
The Legal Offense initiative appears
as a result of a bill passed by the
Student Senate. Yale Braunstein, who
sponsored the bill in the Senate states,
"Legal Offense ... is seeking funding
from the student body to initiate a
program of assistance to students in
legal matters."
Braunstein explained, "Part of this
program will be modeled after a similar
system now operating at San Jose State

College. There students can get free
legal advice from a local lawyer in all
Housing matters such as understanding
lease requirements, obtaining deposit
refunds and fighting housing
discrimination."
Salary and Expenses
The one dollar per student per
quarter levy could cover the salary and
expenses of a lawyer who will have
office hours on campus for four days
each week, according to Braunstein.
The lawyer would be available to the
ASSU, all student organizations
(including publications), and all
registered students.
"While the levy will probably not be
sufficient to cover any costs involved in
cases that go to court, it should be
adequate to cover all consultations
before trial and could enable students

to stay out of court," Braunstein
concluded.
KZSU
Be it enacted by the Associated Students
of Stanford University that a one dollar per
student special assessment will be levied
during Autumn Quarter 1971-72 to finance
the voluntary organization known as KZSU,
the Stanford student operated radio station.
Legal Offense
Be it enacted by the Associated Students
of Stanford University that a special
assessment of one dollar per student shall be
levied during the Autumn, Winter, Spring,
and Summer quarters, 1971-1972, for the use
of Legal Offense to take the initiative in legal
and quasi-legal matters affecting the Stanford
community or to help members of this
community obtain legal assistance. The
monies assessed shall be used for basic office
and investigators expenses and for legal
consultation of student government, its
officers, and subsidiary organizations (the
individual or organization to pay Santa Clara
County Bar Association minimums for
additional work); plus full legal consultation
for all registered students.

SLEEP-INâ€”President Lyman may have outlawed sit-ins as incorrect political actions, but he has never mentioned sleep-ins
which are getting to be almost as popular. Last fall, students spent the night in line waiting for Rose Bowl tickets. Last week,
they camped out at the Art Department hoping to get into classes. See story on page 6.
