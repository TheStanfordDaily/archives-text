# Seale Jury Deadlocked; Judge Declares Mistrial

NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Judge
Harold M. Mulvey declared a mistrial
yesterday in the six-month trial of
Black Panther Chairman Bobby G.
Seale and a local Panther leader. The
prosecutor said he would bring them to
trial again.
The Superior Court judge made his
ruling after the jury of five blacks and
seven whites, selected over a period of
four months, insisted it could not agree
on verdicts on any of the charges faced
by Seale or Ericka Huggins arising from
the slaying of Alex Rackley, another
party member.
"I declare a mistrial for the reason
that the jury has failed to reach a
verdict on all of the charges" in the two
cases, Mulvey said. He thanked the 12
jurors and discharged them. They had
deliberated for 23 hours over a six-day
period.
The judge set for today a meeting in
court with both defendants, their
attorneys and the prosecutor. He did
not explain the purpose of the meeting,
but the subjects under discussion were
expected to include a date for a new
trial and requests that Seale and Mrs.
Huggins be released on bail.
"I absolutely will prosecute again,"
said State's Atty. Arnold Markle.
Supporters of the defendants who
had been coming to the marble court
building throughout the trial were
speechless.
As the judge announced his decision,
Seale cocked his head, smiled and made
a facial expression that indicated
resignation at the outcome. Mrs.
Huggins smiled slightly but had no
other visible reaction.
When the two left the building to
the chants of "Free Bobby and Ericka"

by some 100 supporters, Seale raised
his hands-handcuffed and holding a
briefcaseâ€”in a gesture to the crowd.
A court order prevented the
attorneys or the judge in the case from
commenting on the trial. But Theodore
Keskoff, the attorney for a Black
Panther convicted of conspiring to
murder Rackley, said the charges
against Seale and Mrs. Huggins should be
dropped.
