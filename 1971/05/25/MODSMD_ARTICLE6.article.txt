# Death, Arrests In Travis Riots

TRAVIS \IR FORCE BASE (AP) -
About 500 military personnel brawled
last night and several incidents of arson
were reported in what a post
spokesman here said was racial
disorder.
At least 70 arrests and several
injuries were reported.
A fireman died, apparently from
smoke inhalation, while fighting the
blazes, a base spokesman said. Another
fireman was hospitalized with facial
bums.
A Travis spokesman said the trouble
broke out during the evening meal in
one of the dining halls for this
sprawling base with about 1,500
personnel. It is about 45 miles
northeast of San Francisco and serves
as a major embarkation point for
Vietnam.
The spokesman said the outbreak
seemed to be connected with two
weekend incidents, which he said were
racially inspired. A series of fights
resulted in half-dozen minor injuries
and two arrests during the weekend.
