what election?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Did you know there is going to
be an ASSU election this week?
Can you tell me what measures
are going to be voted on? I made a
few phone calls Monday morning
to learn what I would be voting
on later this week. Most people
contacted knew of the
election(although ;ome did not).
Evidently they had read the
small OFFICIAL NOTICE placed
in the Daily about the middle of
last week giving the dates and
times for the two day election.
Some had also seen the letter
from the KZSU staff in last
Friday's Daily. All that one could
learn was that there is to be an
election this week and one of the
measures to be voted on concerns
an assessment for KZSU.
The amazing thing is that two
days before the election the only
person who seems to know what
is going to be voted on is Mr.
Humphrey, the election
commissioner. I contacted the
Daily, KZSU (who knew about
their own measure), and the
ASSU office. No one could tell
me a thing! I'm beginning to
wonder for whom this election is
to be held? Evidently Mr.
Humphrey is planning to hold his
own private election.
I question the validity of the
entire forth coming election. Is
there not a clause in the ASSU
Constitution requiring that
election measures be published in
the Daily one week prior to the
election?
Does the electorate not have
the right to know what measures
are to be voted on in a reasonable
length of time (hopefully more
than two days!) prior to the
election? By not letting out
specifics Mr. Humphrey is
effectively stifling any support or
opposition to the election
measures.
I hope other students will take
note of this and raise an
objection! It is going to be very
interesting to find out at the polls
on Wednesday what items on the
ballot required all this secrecy.

"Public notice of such an election
shall be given in the Stanford
student newspaper not less than
four days before it shall take
place." No mention is made that
the specific proposals are to be
printed in the Daily. The
Elections Commissioner did not
send the Daily a copy of the
ballot proposals till yesterday
afternoon. See front page

Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read, with shock,
horror and disbelief, the UPI
account in today's Philadelphia
Daily News of some studies by
Stanford University physicist, Dr.
Philip Shockley. According to
Shockley, the introduction of
white genes into Black Americans
both raises their mental capacities
and lowers their physical
performance.
As proof, Shockley cites
differences in performance on IQ
tests by Black people in Ga., with
a lower proportion of white genes,
and those in Calif., with a higher
proportion of white genes. The
Black people in Calif, scored
higher in the tests given.
No mention is made of the
inferiority of the school system in
Ga., the terrible poverty, the
malnutrition, the lack of adequate
medical care — or any of the other
conditions under which Black
people are forced to live in the
racist state of Georgia.
If there are any differences in
scoring in IQ tests between Black
Americans in Ga. and those in
Calif., it is most certainly a result
of these factors — not any
supposed racial inferiority!
As an alumni of Stanford
University Graduate School, I
must protest this outragious
propagation of racist ideology in
the name of "science." Such false
notions can only serve the
purposes of the most reactionary,
racist elements in our society. For
what is the logic of such a
position?
The first conclusion that will
be drawn bv racist, fascist-minded

elements ir that whites are
inherently superior to Black
people.
The second conclusion that
will be drawn is that intermarriage
between races will be a disaster
because it will lower the IQ of
whites.
The third conclusion to be
drawn is that slavery, with all its
horrors, can be justified on the
grounds that Black Africans were
made more "intelligent" through
the blessing of being oppressed,
stolen from their homeland, and
raped by white slave owners.
Does this abuse of science not
lay the basis for a facist policy of
genocide against Black
Americans? Is this not identical to
Hitler's use of racist notions to
justify mass murder of six million
Jews?
A university such as Stanford
has fallen far short of the ideal of
the search for truth which is the
sole reason for existence of a
university. It has become a center
for the perpetuation of racism
under the false banner of science.

supposed racial inferiority!
As an alumni of Stanford
University Graduate School, I
must protest this outragious
propagation of racist ideology in
the name of "science." Such false
notions can only serve the
purposes of the most reactionary,
racist elements in our society. For
what is the logic of such a
position?
The first conclusion that will
be drawn bv racist, fascist-minded

elements ir that whites are
inherently superior to Black
people.
The second conclusion that
will be drawn is that intermarriage
between races will be a disaster
because it will lower the IQ of
whites.
The third conclusion to be
drawn is that slavery, with all its
horrors, can be justified on the
grounds that Black Africans were
made more "intelligent" through
the blessing of being oppressed,
stolen from their homeland, and
raped by white slave owners.
Does this abuse of science not
lay the basis for a facist policy of
genocide against Black
Americans? Is this not identical to
Hitler's use of racist notions to
justify mass murder of six million
Jews?
A university such as Stanford
has fallen far short of the ideal of
the search for truth which is the
sole reason for existence of a
university. It has become a center
for the perpetuation of racism
under the false banner of science.

what election?
Editor, THE DAILY:
Did you know there is going to
be an ASSU election this week?
Can you tell me what measures
are going to be voted on? I made a
few phone calls Monday morning
to learn what I would be voting
on later this week. Most people
contacted knew of the
election(although ;ome did not).
Evidently they had read the
small OFFICIAL NOTICE placed
in the Daily about the middle of
last week giving the dates and
times for the two day election.
Some had also seen the letter
from the KZSU staff in last
Friday's Daily. All that one could
learn was that there is to be an
election this week and one of the
measures to be voted on concerns
an assessment for KZSU.
The amazing thing is that two
days before the election the only
person who seems to know what
is going to be voted on is Mr.
Humphrey, the election
commissioner. I contacted the
Daily, KZSU (who knew about
their own measure), and the
ASSU office. No one could tell
me a thing! I'm beginning to
wonder for whom this election is
to be held? Evidently Mr.
Humphrey is planning to hold his
own private election.
I question the validity of the
entire forth coming election. Is
there not a clause in the ASSU
Constitution requiring that
election measures be published in
the Daily one week prior to the
election?
Does the electorate not have
the right to know what measures
are to be voted on in a reasonable
length of time (hopefully more
than two days!) prior to the
election? By not letting out
specifics Mr. Humphrey is
effectively stifling any support or
opposition to the election
measures.
I hope other students will take
note of this and raise an
objection! It is going to be very
interesting to find out at the polls
on Wednesday what items on the
ballot required all this secrecy.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just read, with shock,
horror and disbelief, the UPI
account in today's Philadelphia
Daily News of some studies by
Stanford University physicist, Dr.
Philip Shockley. According to
Shockley, the introduction of
white genes into Black Americans
both raises their mental capacities
and lowers their physical
performance.
As proof, Shockley cites
differences in performance on IQ
tests by Black people in Ga., with
a lower proportion of white genes,
and those in Calif., with a higher
proportion of white genes. The
Black people in Calif, scored
higher in the tests given.
No mention is made of the
inferiority of the school system in
Ga., the terrible poverty, the
malnutrition, the lack of adequate
medical care — or any of the other
conditions under which Black
people are forced to live in the
racist state of Georgia.
If there are any differences in
scoring in IQ tests between Black
Americans in Ga. and those in
Calif., it is most certainly a result
of these factors — not any
supposed racial inferiority!
