# legitimized crime
## Strip Miners, Power Co. Profiteering 
### 
An advertisement appeared in
the Chronicle of Thursday, May
20, paid for by several groups of
environmentalists and
conservationists from the
Southwest, titled: "... Like
Ripping Apart St. Peter's In Order
To Sell the Marble."
The appearance of this ad
elucidates two issues: first, it most
probably went undiscovered by
too many of us (although it
appeared last week in at least one
other newspaper, the L.A.Times,)
and more importantly, it is but
another indication that we usually
learn of legitimized crime in this
country after the fact, it at all.
Heinous as this situation is, it is
not the most immediate issue
facing us this particular Tuesday
morning. More important today is
the activity which these people
have revealed to us and of which
they beg us to seek curtailment:
the operations already underway
by the Peabody Coal Company
around Black Mesa, Arizona.
Ash And Soot
Peabody has plans to build six
enormous coal-burning power
plants in and around Black Mesa
in the heart of the Four Corners
area. Two of them, one near

Farmington, New Mexico, and the
other in the Navajo country in
northern Arizona, are already
built.
The Farmington plant alone is
already putting out 350 tons of
fly ash and soot each day. (By
comparison, Bay area figures for
particulate put into the air by five
oil refineries and 10 power plants
in 1970 were 176 tons a day.)
And if the project is not impeded,
then 1 will be six times as much
pollution when the other plants
are operative.
The purpose of these monsters
is to provide additional electrical
power—not for the Four Corners
area- but for those three centers
of natural beauty, Phoenix, Las
Vegas, and Los Angeles. The
reason the plants could not be
constructed in or near any of
these cities is that such pollutants
as they produce (sulphur oxides,
nitrogen oxides, ash, soot, and
other particulates) are illegal in
Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Los
Angeles.
Thus the perfect place to put
them is in the last 100,000 square
miles of open country and clean
air in the U.S., for that land is
only inhabited by animals, trees,
farm produce, and 250,000 Hopi
and Navajo Native Americans.
Of course all of this can be
sacrificed to 24-hour neon signs
for Las Vegas, not to mention
that this area has been a favorite
of boatsmen (Lakes Powell and
Mead will be affected), hikers,
climbers, fishermen, swimmers
and campers. Obviously the
Federal Power Commission and
Peabody Coal have no qualms
about sacrificing our property
(yes, yours and mine) to
"growth."
Two-Headed Monster
Peabody's monster, as you may
have guessed, is two-headed. In
order to keep these plants
running, coal is being stripmined
from three huge areas around
Black Mesa.
As residents of West Virginia
know only too well, strip mining

simply moans carving the
landscape. It is probably the most
ecologically destructive method of
coal mining, but it is also the
cheapest, and therefore endears
itself to Peabody officials.
Black Mesa is not just a piece
of land with a lot of coal in it. It
has been home for the Hopi for
one thousand years. It was a
perfect place for the Hopi
reservation, as the government
most likely found it too arid and
desolate for Anglo habitation.
The Hopi, however, consider
Black Mesa sacred
ground—" ... the spiritual center
of this land," says John Lansa, a
Hopi elder quoted in the full-page
spread. They believe they grew
directly from this land; ripping it
apart will destroy their People.
This is actually a more
practical than a spiritual view, as
the 3,168,000 gallons of water
Peabody is extracting each day for
a coal slurry pipeline may very
well exhaust the supply of the
region and thus phase the Hopi
out of existence.
Railroad Plans
In addition to the mines and
plants, blueprints (which have
never been subject to public
scrutiny, impartial studies on
alternatives or reports to the
Federal Power Commission) also
call for construction of an 80 mile
coal-hauling railroad (across
Havajo land), a 273 mile slurry
pipeline across Navajo and Hopi
lands, hundreds of miles of work
roads and thousands of miles of
power lines - in the largest
remaining open space in America.
We ought not neglect the
Peabody Coal Company in our
outrage. Yes, they say they have a
legal lease for the use of the land,
signed by the Hopi Tribal Council.
That would be well and good
except for the minor fact that the
Hopi recognize no such
hierarchical structure: it was
created by the Bureau of Indian
Affairs as a matter of practicality
(the implications of this are

marcy kahn

horrifying) and the Hopi say that
they completely repudiate its
legitimacy in speaking for the
Nation.
Who is Peabody Coal
Company, anyway? Since 1968,
Peabody has been a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Kennecott Copper
Corporation, which those of us
from the Southwest know only
too well for their major role in
phasing clean air out of the
climatic picture in Phoenix and
much of Southeastern Arizona,
where their Ray Mines Division
operates a 2100 acre copper
mining and smelting operation (at
one time underground, now open
pit).
Kennecott also has 41 other
strip and bituminous coal mines in
eight states and Australia, while,
as the world's largest copper
producer, it also owns 49 porcent
of the Sociedad Minera El
Teniente S.A. in Chile.
Anti-trust Charge
What is less known about
Kennecott and its acquisition of
Peabody is that in August, 1968,
the Federal Trade Commission
issued a complaint against the
Company alleging that the
acquisition of the business and
assets of Peabody Coal Co. and its
subsidiaries violated Section Seven
of the Clayton Anti-Trust Act of
1914.
In March, 1970, a hearing was
held, and the examiner
recommended dismissal of the
complaint, as in his view (which is
subject to review by the whole
commission), the Clayton
Anti-trust Act was not violated by
the company as charged by the
FTC. His prediction was that
Kennecott was not a potential
entrant into a coal business and
that the coal industry was not a
highly concentrated one.
This is interesting, for eight
months later, Kennecott
announced that Peabody just
finished negotiating with the
Tennessee Valley Authority to
amend an existing contract
(thereby doubling its previous
shipment to TVA's Shawnee
steam plant of 15,000 tons of coal
per week) and seal two others,
covering fifteen years and
4,365,000 tons of coal. This is
without even considering
Peabody's escapades in the
Southwest. It certainly is difficult
to believe that Kennecott is not in
the coal business.
Hearings
This week hearings are going
on in Albuquerque and elsewhere
under the chairmanship of
Senator Henry Jackson, Chairman
of the Senate Interior committee.
He ought to receive telegrams
from us immediately.
It might be wise to inform him
that the total emissions from this
plant—even with pollution control
devices—would be equivalent to
the exhaust of 1.5 million
automobiles; or that the sulfur
oxides produced (2,166) tons per
day, with controls) are almost 10
times as great as those produced
by all sources, including
automobiles, in Los Angeles (275
tons per day) or the Bay Area (237
tons per day). His address is
Senate Office Bldg., Wash., D.C.
20510.
Mr. John Nicholas Nassikas,
Chairman of the Federal Power
Commission, would also love to
hear from us. His address is 441
"G" Street N.W., Wash., D.C.
20426. One thing he might be
told is that smoke from the
Farmington plant was
photographed by a Gemini
satellite recently—and that it was
the only product of man visible
from out there.
