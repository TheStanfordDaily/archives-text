learning
by david nyberg
U This book is about how people treat one another in
_ _ classroom situations, with some implications for how
mZ&C people could (o should) treat each other in such situations.
It explores, in the light of contemporary scientific and
-du social theory, workable ideas and theoretical bases for
developing a more effective (and tolerable) educational
'.> environment. 11 treats, in a nonlinear way, the need
y to combine the terms "humane' 'and "human" into one,
i chiefly through the connection of thought and feeling.

delightful candor, and high enthusiasm for the potential
inherent in each teacher-pupil relationship.
