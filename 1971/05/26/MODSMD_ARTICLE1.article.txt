# ASSU To Expose Tresidder Flaws
## 
### SCOTT THACHER News Analysis 
Anyone who has become disgruntled with the
cheeseburger he bought at the Tresidder food service
or bussed dishes off Tresidder's heavily frequented
patio at noontime, has an opinion on why the hours
are shorter and its finances are in bad shape.
A budgetary crisis not only precipitated the layoff
of 12 food service employees in February, but has
forced Tresidder to request $160,000 in aid from the
University for next year. Although Tresidder has been
subsidized since its beginning, this is a $50,000
increase over the amount budgeted for the present
fiscal year.
The ASSU Senate, doubtful that management and
employment practices there were on the level,
sponsored two hearings last week as the first step of a
full investigation of the operations there.
The Senate also appointed four new student
members to a committee responsible for running
Tresidder. The new members hope to use their
position to probe more deeply into the Union's
operation.
The people who spoke at the ASSU hearings
largely employees and former employees, described
poor sanitary conditions, bad relations with their
supervisors, and a lack of adequate personnel during
periods of heavy business, as being important reasons
for dissatisfaction with Tresidder.
Tresidder's problem, aside from the fact that it
may provoide bad service, is that not enough money
is made downstairs to support the operations upstairs.
When it was built, ground floor profits from the food
service, drugstore, bowling alley, and later the Coffee

House paid custodial and administrative costs for
meeting rooms and the browsing area upstairs.
This is less and less true. In the last three years the
number of poeple using the food service has dropped
by 33 percent, while the number using the
non-revenue producing areas upstairs has increased by
60 percent.
Tregea says use of the food service has declined
since many other eating places have become available
on campus. He also cites inflation and the preference
of many students to cook in their own kitchen to
explain the drop in patronage.
Scott Burke, an ASSU senator co-ordinating the
investigations, is not willing to describe what he has
found before the investigations are completed. The
intent of the hearings had been to hear testimony
which would lead to questions important enough to
pursue.
He does say, however, that a report where
"definite charges will be brought out" is going to be
ready in about a week, when he hopes to broadcast it
over KZSU.
The Tresidder committee, which has the four new
student members along with faculty and
administrators, will also be asked to take action on
the report. The Board of Trustees will be presented
with the findings in June.
The report will look carefully at how grievances
are handled at Tresidder. At the hearings, Craige
McKnight, who works at the Coffee House, stated he
knew of an employee who had filed a grievance, but
felt it unwise to give his name.
On the other hand Tregea stated in a recent

interview that as far as he knew no employee
grievances had been filed against Tresidder during its
existence.
Specific violations of University employment
policies, particularly at the ( Coffee House may be
brought up. Also under question is the accounting
method which is used to show whether a "profit" or
a "loss" is being made by different operations at
Tresidder.
At the moment Tregea claims that the profit he
calculates for each area, such as drugstore or food
service, is done by subtracting the direct cost of labor
and supplies from the total money it takes in.
Many people familiar with Tresidder's operations
claim that when it comes to dividing up the indirect
costs — utilities, maintenance, and janitorial care-a
method is used that can be unfair.
In fact, one employee at the Coffee House said
this system was so open to manipulation that he felt
the management could use it as an "ace in the hole in
case the Coffee He use got uppity," to show them
operating at a loss.
Tregea contends that no system of assigning
indirect costs is used in his accounts. According to
him decisions on opening or closing different
operations are made on the basis of usage and not
profit or loss.
As far as outright misdoings go, Tresidder is not an
obvious site of scandal. This year's financial manager,
Chuck Peterson is generally skeptical of University
operations. He says,"the evidence doesn't look much
worse than you find in any other part of the
University."
