# thoughts on the american revolution
## What It Is, Or What It Was? 
### 
joknie scott

It is not amiss to note that the
"American Revolution" has
turned 360 degrees in the 195
years this country has called itself
a sovereign state, free to fly its
own colors, free to sing its own
priases, free to wage its own wars.
By that, and I ask you all to
consider carefully what I say,
America has gone through a great
many changes, all of which have
played an important part in
affecting the thinking and
behavior of the one group in
America locked in a standstill
while European immigrants
crossed the Atlantic searching for
that equal opportunity so
apparently lacking in the Old
Country.
One Group
That one group was here to see
the American Indian reduced to
reservation status. That same
group saw the Chinese brought to
these shores first as coolies, later
to assume control of their own
banking institutions while
preserving some semblance of a
culture 5 000 years old.
That same group saw the

Germans, the Poles, Hungarians,
Slavs, Russians, Belgians, Italians
all come over to these shores in
successive waves—first, as illiterate
(non-English speaking)
immigrants, then, to move into
the economic mainstream. This
group lived through the American
Revolution, the Spanish-American
War, the two World Wars, Korea,
Indochina, and now, Vietnam.
It is the peculiar history of this
group, its birth on American
shores as "slaves" rather than
"indentured servants," its central
role in America's first war of
conscience, that Civil War which
resulted in their "Emancipation."
It is this peculiar history,
neglected and at times blatantly
ignored in the teaching of the
America past, that highlights what
is now emerging as America's
second war of conscience.
Would you let your daughter
marry a Negro?
We all know it is true that this
question goes to the heart of
every American's bias towards the
Black. We all know it is true
because individuals who do cross
this taboo zone in social relations
hang in a special limbo within the
American psyche.
A young white girl, about 20
years old or so, told me the other
day that her "upbringing" was
such that she could approve of
any social relationship,
intercourse even, but that she
couldn't get next to the notion of
a black and white tying that knot.
She was from Redwood City. Her
father sold life insurance and her
mother was an alcoholic.
To me, she wasn't anything,
the young girl, so much as she was
here and now, 1971, real-life flesh
and blood, someone who had

gotten aboard the Great
Existential American Covered
Wagon and headed West once
again, only this time the frontier
consisted not so much of land as
it did of men's souls, their minds,
and their oft-times frightening
habits.
Babbitt
She was strange, this white girl.
Her conversation dwelt not so
much on Vietnam, or the
reduction of troops in Europe, or
the exploitation of blacks in
South Africa and South America
as it did on her past. She was not
talking about English Literature,
but you could see that her father
in many ways was similar to that
character Babbitt.
Babbitt, the confused and Ugly
American, economically secure
but angry and depressed because
the world around him was visibly
in the midst of a social upheaval.
Babbitt and the millions of
Americans like him in real-life, the
proud fathers and judges of this
country.
It always struck me as strange
that we never really got to talk
about George Babbitt, or Willy
Loman, and that when it did
happen that such a conversation
took place, it was in polite dining
areas rather than in the streets.
It was as though someone
wanted to protect Babbitt in his
old age, as though someone had
declared a cease-fire where the
American Identity was or might
have been concerned.
Up Against the Wall,
Muthafucka, This is a Stick-up!
It became, in a way, much
easier to be shocked in this
country by profanity than by
massacres or court-sanctioned
executions.

It has even become possible to
1 censor words and phrases like the
above, as though through such an
act the phrase will pass out of
mind, never admitting to the fact
that the people who utter these
words, who live by them, again
come from that group which has
watched so many different groups
pass from immigrant status into
the American Mainstream, or else
pass from an original freedom into
the ignominy of the Reservation.
Re-evolution of the Afro-American
Things are going to come to a
head in this decade. This country
will soon be 200 years old. Many
faces have appeared and since
departed from the American
stage. From Jack Johnson to Joe
Louis to Floyd Patterson may
have said a great deal, for
instance, about the re-evolution
the Afro-American himself was
going through.
Things had to bring forth a
man named Muhammad Ali.
Whether America never likes
him—and America never has!—it
does have to admit to the truth he
uttered just this past week at
Stanford, and which he is carrying
all across the country to all the
colleges, to all the students, black
or white, radical or moderate,
militant or dilettante.
You are always worshipping
dead people!
And we, who laughed, publicly
or privately, smarted under the
truth of those words. We have
become, in spite of ourselves, all
of us, a cult, a nation, of
death-worshippers. Who will hide
it?

here and now, 1971, real-life flesh
and blood, someone who had

gotten aboard the Great
Existential American Covered
Wagon and headed West once
again, only this time the frontier
consisted not so much of land as
it did of men's souls, their minds,
and their oft-times frightening
habits.
Babbitt
She was strange, this white girl.
Her conversation dwelt not so
much on Vietnam, or the
reduction of troops in Europe, or
the exploitation of blacks in
South Africa and South America
as it did on her past. She was not
talking about English Literature,
but you could see that her father
in many ways was similar to that
character Babbitt.
Babbitt, the confused and Ugly
American, economically secure
but angry and depressed because
the world around him was visibly
in the midst of a social upheaval.
Babbitt and the millions of
Americans like him in real-life, the
proud fathers and judges of this
country.
It always struck me as strange
that we never really got to talk
about George Babbitt, or Willy
Loman, and that when it did
happen that such a conversation
took place, it was in polite dining
areas rather than in the streets.
It was as though someone
wanted to protect Babbitt in his
old age, as though someone had
declared a cease-fire where the
American Identity was or might
have been concerned.
Up Against the Wall,
Muthafucka, This is a Stick-up!
It became, in a way, much
easier to be shocked in this
country by profanity than by
massacres or court-sanctioned
executions.

It has even become possible to
1 censor words and phrases like the
above, as though through such an
act the phrase will pass out of
mind, never admitting to the fact
that the people who utter these
words, who live by them, again
come from that group which has
watched so many different groups
pass from immigrant status into
the American Mainstream, or else
pass from an original freedom into
the ignominy of the Reservation.
Re-evolution of the Afro-American
Things are going to come to a
head in this decade. This country
will soon be 200 years old. Many
faces have appeared and since
departed from the American
stage. From Jack Johnson to Joe
Louis to Floyd Patterson may
have said a great deal, for
instance, about the re-evolution
the Afro-American himself was
going through.
Things had to bring forth a
man named Muhammad Ali.
Whether America never likes
him—and America never has!—it
does have to admit to the truth he
uttered just this past week at
Stanford, and which he is carrying
all across the country to all the
colleges, to all the students, black
or white, radical or moderate,
militant or dilettante.
You are always worshipping
dead people!
And we, who laughed, publicly
or privately, smarted under the
truth of those words. We have
become, in spite of ourselves, all
of us, a cult, a nation, of
death-worshippers. Who will hide
it?

It is not amiss to note that the
"American Revolution" has
turned 360 degrees in the 195
years this country has called itself
a sovereign state, free to fly its
own colors, free to sing its own
priases, free to wage its own wars.
By that, and I ask you all to
consider carefully what I say,
America has gone through a great
many changes, all of which have
played an important part in
affecting the thinking and
behavior of the one group in
America locked in a standstill
while European immigrants
crossed the Atlantic searching for
that equal opportunity so
apparently lacking in the Old
Country.
One Group
That one group was here to see
the American Indian reduced to
reservation status. That same
group saw the Chinese brought to
these shores first as coolies, later
to assume control of their own
banking institutions while
preserving some semblance of a
culture 5 000 years old.
That same group saw the

Germans, the Poles, Hungarians,
Slavs, Russians, Belgians, Italians
all come over to these shores in
successive waves—first, as illiterate
(non-English speaking)
immigrants, then, to move into
the economic mainstream. This
group lived through the American
Revolution, the Spanish-American
War, the two World Wars, Korea,
Indochina, and now, Vietnam.
It is the peculiar history of this
group, its birth on American
shores as "slaves" rather than
"indentured servants," its central
role in America's first war of
conscience, that Civil War which
resulted in their "Emancipation."
It is this peculiar history,
neglected and at times blatantly
ignored in the teaching of the
America past, that highlights what
is now emerging as America's
second war of conscience.
Would you let your daughter
marry a Negro?
We all know it is true that this
question goes to the heart of
every American's bias towards the
Black. We all know it is true
because individuals who do cross
this taboo zone in social relations
hang in a special limbo within the
American psyche.
A young white girl, about 20
years old or so, told me the other
day that her "upbringing" was
such that she could approve of
any social relationship,
intercourse even, but that she
couldn't get next to the notion of
a black and white tying that knot.
She was from Redwood City. Her
father sold life insurance and her
mother was an alcoholic.
To me, she wasn't anything,
the young girl, so much as she was
here and now, 1971, real-life flesh
and blood, someone who had

does have to admit to the truth he
uttered just this past week at
Stanford, and which he is carrying
all across the country to all the
colleges, to all the students, black
or white, radical or moderate,
militant or dilettante.
You are always worshipping
dead people!
And we, who laughed, publicly
or privately, smarted under the
truth of those words. We have
become, in spite of ourselves, all
of us, a cult, a nation, of
death-worshippers. Who will hide
it?

It is not amiss to note that the
"American Revolution" has
turned 360 degrees in the 195
years this country has called itself
a sovereign state, free to fly its
own colors, free to sing its own
priases, free to wage its own wars.
By that, and I ask you all to
consider carefully what I say,
America has gone through a great
many changes, all of which have
played an important part in
affecting the thinking and
behavior of the one group in
America locked in a standstill
while European immigrants
crossed the Atlantic searching for
that equal opportunity so
apparently lacking in the Old
Country.
One Group
That one group was here to see
the American Indian reduced to
reservation status. That same
group saw the Chinese brought to
these shores first as coolies, later
to assume control of their own
banking institutions while
preserving some semblance of a
culture 5 000 years old.
That same group saw the

Germans, the Poles, Hungarians,
Slavs, Russians, Belgians, Italians
all come over to these shores in
successive waves—first, as illiterate
(non-English speaking)
immigrants, then, to move into
the economic mainstream. This
group lived through the American
Revolution, the Spanish-American
War, the two World Wars, Korea,
Indochina, and now, Vietnam.
It is the peculiar history of this
group, its birth on American
shores as "slaves" rather than
"indentured servants," its central
role in America's first war of
conscience, that Civil War which
resulted in their "Emancipation."
It is this peculiar history,
neglected and at times blatantly
ignored in the teaching of the
America past, that highlights what
is now emerging as America's
second war of conscience.
Would you let your daughter
marry a Negro?
We all know it is true that this
question goes to the heart of
every American's bias towards the
Black. We all know it is true
because individuals who do cross
this taboo zone in social relations
hang in a special limbo within the
American psyche.
A young white girl, about 20
years old or so, told me the other
day that her "upbringing" was
such that she could approve of
any social relationship,
intercourse even, but that she
couldn't get next to the notion of
a black and white tying that knot.
She was from Redwood City. Her
father sold life insurance and her
mother was an alcoholic.
To me, she wasn't anything,
the young girl, so much as she was
here and now, 1971, real-life flesh
and blood, someone who had

gotten aboard the Great
Existential American Covered
Wagon and headed West once
again, only this time the frontier
consisted not so much of land as
it did of men's souls, their minds,
and their oft-times frightening
habits.
Babbitt
She was strange, this white girl.
Her conversation dwelt not so
much on Vietnam, or the
reduction of troops in Europe, or
the exploitation of blacks in
South Africa and South America
as it did on her past. She was not
talking about English Literature,
but you could see that her father
in many ways was similar to that
character Babbitt.
Babbitt, the confused and Ugly
American, economically secure
but angry and depressed because
the world around him was visibly
in the midst of a social upheaval.
Babbitt and the millions of
Americans like him in real-life, the
proud fathers and judges of this
country.
It always struck me as strange
that we never really got to talk
about George Babbitt, or Willy
Loman, and that when it did
happen that such a conversation
took place, it was in polite dining
areas rather than in the streets.
It was as though someone
wanted to protect Babbitt in his
old age, as though someone had
declared a cease-fire where the
American Identity was or might
have been concerned.
Up Against the Wall,
Muthafucka, This is a Stick-up!
It became, in a way, much
easier to be shocked in this
country by profanity than by
massacres or court-sanctioned
executions.

It has even become possible to
1 censor words and phrases like the
above, as though through such an
act the phrase will pass out of
mind, never admitting to the fact
that the people who utter these
words, who live by them, again
come from that group which has
watched so many different groups
pass from immigrant status into
the American Mainstream, or else
pass from an original freedom into
the ignominy of the Reservation.
Re-evolution of the Afro-American
Things are going to come to a
head in this decade. This country
will soon be 200 years old. Many
faces have appeared and since
departed from the American
stage. From Jack Johnson to Joe
Louis to Floyd Patterson may
have said a great deal, for
instance, about the re-evolution
the Afro-American himself was
going through.
Things had to bring forth a
man named Muhammad Ali.
Whether America never likes
him—and America never has!—it
does have to admit to the truth he
uttered just this past week at
Stanford, and which he is carrying
all across the country to all the
colleges, to all the students, black
or white, radical or moderate,
