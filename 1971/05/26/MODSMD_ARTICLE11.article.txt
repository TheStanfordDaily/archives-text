# 'if truly the will of this community'
## Packard's Resignation? 
### 
David packard

(On April 7, the Daily
published a letter from Elenor
Macoby, Robert Moulton, Jr., B.
Davie Napier, and Robert McAfee
Brown requesting Deputy
Secretary of Defense and former
Stanford Trustee David Packard
to resign. It urged him to do so
for "the physical survival of the
Vietnamese, and for the sake of
the moral survival of the United
States." The following is
Packard's reply, released through
his office—Ed.)
Dear Sirs and Madam:
I have received your
communication and I do, as you
expected, take it seriously. The
primary point I would make is
that I feel certain I can contribute
to the ultimate welfare of our
world much more effectively right
now from where 1 am rather than
from among a community whose
voice—representative or not—is
heard only through
mimeographed petitions.
Your petition does kindly
acknowledge certain "creative
things" I have done in the

Stanford community and my
demonstrated sensitivity to the
social issues which concern us all,
saying:
"We recognize that in the past
you have done many creative
things within the Stanford
community and have been
sensitive to many of the social
issues that concern us all. "
I believe this preamble
sentence of your petition
establishes a fair measure from
which you may understand my
personal values and actions I have
taken not just in the Stanford
community but also as Deputy
Secretary of Defense.
A man's cherished values do
not change with a temporary
change in geography or position.
My personal values—those that
have guided my past actions-are
the same values I apply to my
present responsibilities. These
values have guided me in
directions I believe both of us
favor. On some issues we may
differ on precise timing; but we
are together, not at odds, on our
objectives of ending U.S.
involvement in battle and
achieving a generation of peace.
One of my primary objectives
in coming to Washington was to
do what I could to reverse the
past trend of increasing U.S.
military involvement in Southeast
Asia. You are aware of the
withdrawal program now going
steadily forward. While I am not
the ultimate authority in this
Department, or in this
Administration, or for the
Congress, or for our nation, I do
value the opportunity I have had
to play a part in reversing U.S.
participation in the war.
Your petition takes particular
note of the issue of defoliation. I
have given close personal
attention to this issue. Here also
we have reversed previous policy;
defoliant use in Southeast Asia
now is governed by exactly the
same standards and restrictions we
use for ourselves in the United
States. I believe this change was
worth making, and I am glad I
could help do it.
In reflecting on the months 1
have spent in my present position,
I must candidly say that I am
simultaneously dissatisfied and
pleased.
I am dissatisfied that pressing
problems remain before us. I have

found that things do not always
move as fast or as smoothly here
in Washington as many of us
would like. But I did not expect
this to be an easy job. Neither did
I find it easy for me to be denied
an opportunity to speak last
month in my home city because
some of its citizens disagree with
the speed with which Americans
are coming home from Asia.
Nevertheless, I am pleased that
we have accomplished so much: a
Middle East ceasefire; on-going
strategic arms limitation talks;
improved Defense contracting;
increased minority employment
and supervisory participation;
steps toward a zero draft call;
reduced Defense budgets but
increased pay for all service
people. I believe these types of
complex problems are solved by
confronting them, not by
abandoning their challenge.
Everyone knows I am not and
will not become a career member
of the government. There will
come a time when I will leave the
Department of Defense and
Washington. My departure when it
comes will be for personal
reasons, not because I believe one
can accomplish more by talking
about a problem than he can by
acting on it.
If I were to leave tomorrow I
would do so in the sincere belief
that it has been useful to have in
just two years addressed the tasks
I mentioned above and also to
have played an active part in
turning America around away
from war and toward peace.
I take your petition seriously
for another reason. If the signers
of the petition reflect accurately
the attitudes of the Stanford
community toward me, I would
not want to force myself on this
community in any way.
If it is truly the will and desire
of this community that I
withdraw from it I will respond to
your request. I hope, therefore,
you will send me all the names
you collect so I can make the
assessment of whether the views
expressed in the petition are held
by the majority of the Stanford
faculty.
David Packard
P.S. I would be pleased if you
would share this personal letter
with those who have joined you in
signing the petition.
