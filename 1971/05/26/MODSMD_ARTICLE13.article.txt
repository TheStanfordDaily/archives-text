Mr. James M. Roche, Chairman of
the Board General Motors
Corporation
The Trustees of Stanford
Univeuity determined today to
abstain from voting Stanford's
shares either for or against
Stockholder Proposal VIII, which
directs the Corporation to cease
all manufacturing operations in
the Republic of South Africa.
We wish to express our reasons
for doing so, and, with the
realization that the Corporation
will probably continue to operate
in South Africa, to urge that it
take all feasible steps to culminate
discrimination against non-whites
in all activities with which it is
concerned.
Stanford University firmly
opposes all discrimination based
on race. We have abstained from
voting against Stockholder
Proposal VIII in order to avoid
any possible implication of
support for the policy of
apartheid.
We agree with the apparent
intent of the Proposal to oppose
racial discrimination, although we
do not agree with the steps it
proposes toward this end.
Most trustees doubt that
withdrawal from South Africa by
General Motors now would
significantly aid the cause of racial
equality in South Africa or
advance the welfare of non-white
subject to discrimination there.
On the contrary, withdrawal
now by General Motors, and other
comparable American
corporations, would reduce
employment for non-whites and
make their plight more difficult,
not easier. We believe that the
Corporation's greatest
contribution to lessening racial
discrimination in South Africa can
be made by using all feasible
means to combat it. We urge that
General Motors do so and keep
the public informed of its efforts
in this direction.

student vote
Dear Mr. Roche:
At its regular meeting on May
11, the Stanford Board of
Trustees, after a thorough
discussion, decided to vote against
General Motors Stockholder
Proposals V and VII, but directed
that I write you giving our reasons
for these actions.
The Board, in its decision on
proposal V, expressed sympathy
with shareholder efforts to
broaden the method of
designating nominees for
Directors and its belief that
management should develop
methods by which such efforts
can be implemented effectively.
However, the specific proposals
for achieving this purpose
contained in proposition V, were
not considered practical or
appropriate.
With respect to proposal VII,
the Board went on record as
urging General Motors
management to recognize the
desirability of publishing
additional information on matters
of minority recruiting and
employment. Again, however, the
Board could not support the
detailed proposals contained in
this particular proposition.
The trustees also asked me to
send you the results of a vote of
Stanford students taken in early
April on General Motors
Stockholder Proposals V, VI, VII
and VIII. They are as follows:
FOR AGAINST
V- 2,552 - 550
VI- 2,184- 686
VII- 2,415-342
VIII- 2,077- 846

Editor, THE DAILY:
At the risk of making even
more out of what is already a
tempest in a teapot, allow us to
add a few background facts
concerning the Stanford YR's.
Under Roman Buhler's
leadership, enthusiasm for the
club so mounted that only three
of the club's eight offices could be
filled at last Thursday's election.
Buhler's candidate lost, and since
then he has been trying to
eradicate whatever vestige of
vitality the club has by trying to

remove the newly elected officers,
thus leaving the club without
leadership in the fall.
The process culminated
monday in his attempt to tum an
informal meeting of the GSB
Republicans into an
"impeachment" proceeding, the
reasons being, that one officer was
a foreign student, that another
was, according to his standards,
politically unsuitable, and in the
third case, no reason was cited.
He brought along his own
voting support, four people who
had not seen fit to attend the
election meeting last week, and
then dashed over to the Daily
office to file a story.
The sense of last Thursday's
meeting was that the new officers
rebuild the club in a fall
membership drive, and have
elections to fill the remaining
offices. Membership is open to
Republicans of all persuasions •
this is the spirit in which we
intend to run the club, and we
reject the ideological narrowness
and ASSU-type machinations of
Roman Buhler.

research
Editor, THE DAILY:
The question of judging a
university research program in
terms of the military's interest in
a potential application which may
grow out of it is a real and a
complex one (as Guy Whitehead
pointed out in Monday's Daily)
particularly if the application is
considered undesirable. Although
we cannot dismiss lightly the
problems which may arise as a
consequence of such research, we
should be very critical of any
attempted solution which involves
prohibitions against the research
itself.
A similar concern—that
increased knowledge may lead to
harmful use of it—has arisen many
times in the past in connection
with teaching or the conveying of
knowledge: fear of the printing
press, censorship of "dangerous"
books, laws against teaching
certain subjects (such as
communism, or evolution).
For the most part we have
learned by now that whatever
may be the danger of such
knowledge (if any) it is far less

than the danger of trying to limit,
control, or prevent the
communication of knowledge.
Are we now to advocate a
solution for research which we
reject for teaching"? Can we
prevent uncovering new
knowledge by refusing to work on
itby refusing to let our fellow
man work on it? The history of
scientific discovery is rife with
examples of the same bit of
knowledge being uncovered
independently and in near
simultaneity by different people.
If we had stopped our work on
atomic chain reactions in 1940,
would that have prevented Stalin
from developing an atomic bomb?
If we close down the Artificial
Intelligence Project here, who
will stop Chairman Mao from
developing an automated
battlefield?
If we are concerned about
harmful applications, isn't the
answer to press for beneficial
applications? Shouldn't we
concentrate on controlling the
execution of the applications
rather than stopping the flow of
knowledge on which the
applications are based?
The problem is further
complicated by the temptation to
associate DOD interests with
undesirable applications—thereby
forgetting that part of "defense"
involves maintaining a healthy and
vigorous base of technical
knowledge, independent of
immediate application. Thus the
tendency toward censoring certain
areas of research takes the form of
moves to exclude particular

sources of support, such as DOD.
There are times when the
pursuit of truths involves courage.
It is an awesome thing to stand in
the light of a new discovery. And
it is all too easy for the awe to
turn to panic when destructive
uses are evident possibilities. But
if we are to avoid a dark ages of
ignorance or, worse, partial
knowledge, we cannot rely on the
delusion that by turning our back

on a question we can make its evil
aspects vanish.
Let us take the Pentagon's
money, and spend it on the
gathering of new or improved
knowledge, openly available to all,
and then, separately, see to it that
the knowledge is put to
constructive use in improving the
quality of life.
