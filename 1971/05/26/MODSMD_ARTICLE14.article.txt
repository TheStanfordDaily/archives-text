# Mayday Arrests Raise Constitutional Issues
## 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
An intense legal debate that could have repercussions
across the country for years to come is underway in
Washington, D.C. in the wake of the Mayday antiwar
demonstrations there earlier this month.
The principal question is this: Did the government
deliberately break the law in order to preserve order in the
Nation's Capitol during those demonstrations?
The Mayday demonstrators' plan, first announced in
August, 1970, was to block early morning commuter traffic
into the city Monday, May 3, and thereby strangle the
government's operation.
The D.C. police department, known as the Metropolitan
Police, aided by thousands of soldiers and acting in close
concert with high-ranking officials of the Nixon
administration, reacted to the Mayday plan by arresting
7,000 persons on one day, the largest such arrest in the
nation's history.
During the rest of the week, the Metropolitan Police
arrested another 5,000 demonstrators, literally flooding and
re-flooding the city's jails.
Civil Liberties Ignored
But the government, in its haste to keep the streets clear
of the "mobs," ignored the demonstrators' civil liberties to
an apparently unprecedented extent.
Atty. Gen. John N. Mitchell, who, like Vice President
Sprio T. Agnew frequently speaks for the President, called
the police department's reaction to the demonstrations a
"decisive opposition to mob force." Mitchell added that he
hoped the Metropolitan Police Department's actions "will set
an example for other communities, in similar circumstances,
to do the same."
The antiwar demonstrators, along with those arrested
downtown for no apparent reason, strongly disagree.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which is
now backing tests of the arrests in the courts, believes that
the government controlled the "mob" by "suspending the
rights guaranteed to us all under the Constitution."
Investigations Urged
One former Assistant U.S. Attorney, Robert L. Ackerly,
now a Washington lawyer, is receiving support for a proposal
that government officials be held responsible for their orders
in both civil damage suits and in criminal charges. He is
urging the convening of a special grand jury, led by a
prosecutor not connected with the Justice Department, to
investigate the government's actions.
And the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals, David
L. Bazelon, has named a special judicial panel to investigate
what happened during the demonstrations and to determine
what other alternatives were available to the police
department.
Among the topics under consideration are:
—Were the arrests of May 3-7 legal or in any other way
appropriate?
—Did the police act in a legitimate manner in suspending
standard procedures for arresting, charging and detaining
suspects?
—Was the traditional function of bail abused by police,
prosecutors or the courts?

—Did the government act properly in calling up troops
and managing the crisis?
—Were techniques designed to handle just such situations
ignored?
Pre-Planned Detention
According to high-ranking Justice Department officials,
the Department had decided in advance that the streets were
to be kept open at all costs and that those arrested were to
be detained for at least 12 hours to "keep them off the
streets."
Exactly how this was to have been done remains a
question, because no one person controlled all 7,000 May 3
arrests.
Most of the arrests, according to the Justice Department,
were justified. However, one Justice Department official said
on May 4 that "when you arrest 7,000 people, you're bound
to get a few who shouldn't be there." Atty. Gen. Mitchell,
breakfasting with reporters two weeks ago, maintained that
"most of those arrested were people who had been ordered
to clear an area."
Witnesses of the week's events however, have repeatedly
reported seeing arrests of people simply walking down the
street. Other persons were arrested at sites of demonstrations
before they had an opportunity to commit illegal acts.
'Free • Arrest Zone'
The ACLU, in a full-page advertisement in the Washington
Post last week, said that "the majority of those arrested were
not committing any offense whatever, and the government
knew it when they swept them up." Terming the
government's actions the "Vietnamization of America,"the
ACLU contended that a "free-arrest zone" — similar to a
free-fire zone in Indochina — was established in downtown
Washington.
"Anybody with a beard, long hair or unconventional dress
was marked for immediate arrest, no matter where they were
or what they were doing," the ACLU charged.
"They were the 'enemy' just as all civilian Vietnamese —
North or South, men, women and children — are the enemy
—'gooks,' 'slants,' and 'slopes.' "
Justification
The strongest justification for mass arrests and other
strong responses to citizen protests is the doctrine of raison
d'etat (reason of state). This principle, according to a
definition by Harvard University political scientist Carl J.
Friedrich, states that "whatever is required to insure the
survival of the state must be done by the individuals
responsible for it, no matter how repugnant such an act may
be to them in their private capacity as decent and moral
men."
However, no responsible official has said that the survival
of the nation — or even that of Washington — was at stake
during the Mayday protests. But Asst. Atty. Gen. William H.
Rehnquist, in a speech in North Carolina on May 5, suggested
that Washington was almost in a state of "qualified martial
law."
Qualified or not, martial law historically has permitted
numerous actions by government officials that would
normally be considered excessive or illegal.

The courts have ruled that the President is the only person
qualified to declare a state of martial law. If President Nixon
had chosen to declare martial law, he could have done so
without the approval of Congress, because a state of
emergency, declared in 1950 by President Harry S. Truman,
has never been rescinded.
But the President never declared martial law. He turned
over management of governmental response to a small group
of key advisers, led by Mitchell.
The Fourth, Sixth and Eighth Amendment, — which are
negated by the imposition of martial law — restrict the
government in its actions against citizens whom it presumes
to have committed crimes; they require probable cause for
arrest, that the suspect know of the charges against him, and
that he be given the rights of a reasonable bail and of a
speedy trial.
But, at least on Mayday, things just didn't work out that
way.
New Arrest Forms
After the 1968 riots in Washington that followed the
assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, the District
developed a new field arrest form that included specific
details of the arrest and a photograph of the arrestee.
However, Metropolitan Police Chief Jerry V. Wilson
suspended the use of the form early on the morning of May
3. He later reversed his decision.
Terming the situation "potentially riotious," a police
department lawyer said that policemen had no time to fill
out the forms because they were constantly under attack
from the demonstrators. Lawyers handling the protestors'
cases have contended, however, that the police had plenty of
time to fill out the simple forms. Reporters at the scenes of
arrests noted that some of those arrested waited with the
arresting officers for 45 minutes before being taken to
holding compounds.
The overall result of this practice was that the police and
prosecutors had thousands of persons in custody without any
idea of where, when or by whom they were arrested, the
specifics of their arrest or — in many cases — the names of
those arrested.
As the city courts become aware of these arrest practices,
they began dismissing charges in large numbers - some
before the accused appeared in court. In one week, they thus
disposed of nearly 6,000 cases.
The ACLU has directed attention to the "falsification of
records" after the arrests were made. Under the direct
supervision of an assistant attorney general, government
lawyers went through the Washington Coliseum, where
several thousand prisoners had been transferred for the night,
belatedly completing field arrest forms and inserting the
name of one of seven police officers — who were not
designated "arresting officers" as the field form requires, but
"court officers" for purposes of prosecution.
No Government Prosecution
The ACLU has charged that the"court officers" still
would not know with what each person specifically was
charged. And it also contends that the government had no
intention of getting convictions on its charges of disorderly
conduct, jaywalking or unlawful entry. What apparently

MASS PROTEST, MASS ARREST, AND THE
LAW—Threatened with civil disobedience in the wake of

authorities made a record number of arrests. The question
now is — were constitutional rights and liberties for the
individual lost in the shuffle?
happened, according to the ACLU, was that arrest
procedures "that would result in solid court cases" were
abandoned in favor practices that would simply keep people
off the streets.
The bail situation was similarly confused, as judges
alternately raised and lowered — depending on what Police
Chief Wilson requested — the amount required for release on
charges of disorderly conduct. Also, the judges determined
that the prisoners denied bail were being held under
conditions equivalent to "cruel and unusual punishment."
The police and Justice Departments have already
suggested that if they had confronted the demonstrators with
larger amounts of force — rather than arrest them —
additional violence and bloodshed would have been
inevitable.
But the ACLU and other non-law-enforcement groups
insist that the emergency would have been better resolved if
it had been permitted to evolve even further — with the
consequence that governmental operations would have been
slowed by about one hour — the same amount of time lost in
a moderate snow storm.
