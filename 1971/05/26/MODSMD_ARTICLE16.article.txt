# Relevant Education
## Urban Studies Faces City Problems 
### DANIEL BRENNER 
The college student trying to make his
education relevant to city problems is faced
with a serious dilemma.
How is he to involve himself in those
problems without making the experience a
sightseeing tour of inner city troubles? And
how does he balance the academic
nicetiesâ€”which legitimize University
sponsorship of his the hardnosed
realities of his work?
The solution to these dilemmas offered at
Stanford is the Program in Urban Studies.
Located in the caverns of the Nitery, Old
Union, the undergraduate staff of US is
developing an interdisciplinary program
which tries to combine the theoretical
approach of the classroom with the stark
facts urbania.
"Act with, not look at" the city, is the
thrust of the program, according to US staff
member Louise Bay. Started by Roy Childs,
it presented over 2 0 courses this term, which
were attended by over 200 students.
Internships
At present, the major offerings of US are
internships with groups concerned with the
city. The choice of intern programs offered
is designed to promote a reciprocal
relationship between student and
organization.
Organizations used for the program must
have some use for the student.
At the same time, the student can apply

his theoretical tools in first evaluating the
organization's performance relative to the
urban program. Subsequently the student
can recommend ways to improve the
program.
For many students, this involvement jars
them into making ideals fit reality. Interns,
who are usually juniors or seniors, then have
the time in their college career to return to
theoretical prognostications, carrying with
them the reality behind the words.
There are a wide variety of internship
offerings. Bi-lingual education, ecology, legal
aid, juvenile hall, and Planned Parenthood
are all areas of involvement.
While US invites all students to
participate in programs, it has become
especially useful for white students who are
faced with the challenge of wanting to do
something to combat racism and are told to
work within the white community.
For example, the course "The White
Problem: White Action Responses to
Racism" held this term, worked on the
problem of low-income housing in the
University area. Programs such as this, notes
Bay, make University curriculum vital, and
"down to earth."
Among other courses which are more
seminar and less field work oriented is
"Social Psychology of Community Design"
slated for fall, which will approach urban
problems viewing technology as directly
connected to the enhancement of social
institutions.

Another, "Regional Environmental
Planning" will first take a multi-faceted view
of water resource planning using pure
scientific and then political frameworks.
Among the instructors for this course will be
a worker of the Bay Area Water Planning
Commission.
The class will also examine a specific
county resource plan, trying to suggest ways
to improve it, based upon their theoretical
considerations during the first part of the
course.
The major problem US faces is in
establishing itself as a full University
Department, thereby generating a majors
sequence rather than the scattered offerings
which now formulate the program.
A proposal for such accredidation to the
Academic Senate will be submitted soon.
This summer, Bay and other members of the
planning committee will formulate a booklet
expanding on the purposes of US.
