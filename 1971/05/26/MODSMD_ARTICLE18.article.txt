# New Orientation Program May End Transfer Blues
## 
### CHRISTINE GRAY 
The plight of the dumped-on
transfer student may soon become
history. Through the efforts of a
new volunteer post-reg orientation
program, some of the pain of
being new, alone, and at the
bottom of every ladder on campus
may be relieved.
A new, volunteer
person-to-person orientation
program is now being prepared for
transfers during the first few
weeks of Fall Quarter. The
program's aim is to provide, on a
one-to-one basis, a campus
contact who will act as a big

brother or sister to a transfer
student after registration.
Obligations are few, costs are
non-existent.
Over 400 transfer students
arrive at Stanford every fall from
all over the country. Under
current University policy, they
will find little or no on-campus
housing available, will be last in
priority for financial aid and last
for class sign-ups as well.
No Red Carpet
Unlike Freshmen, who receive
the red carpet treatment and go
through extensive orientation
upon arrival, transfers have
traditionally been left to fend for
themselves.
Tales are told of transfers
hitching from airports, only to
find the University closed on
week-ends, people beginning the
academic quarter in motel rooms
without transportation to campus,
and a few turning around and
going back from where they came.

Any former transfer can
probably fill in the account with
his own tales of woe.
Gradually these little slips in
communication are being worked
out by the pre-reg committee and
through the September
Clearinghouse, but much remains
to be done to integrate transfers
into university life.
A Needed Improvement
The volunteer program is one
more facet in improvement of the
transfers' lot.
The committee suggests
volunteers invite a new transfer to
dinner at the volunteer's
residence, invite him or her to any
dorm or university functions, be
available to answer questions, and
generally help the transfer
through the first few weeks of
school in a strange atmosphere.
The amount of time spent is up
to each student. The University
will reimburse students for a
limited number of meals during
the quarter. Students will be
matched by their interests,
academic or otherwise.
Volunteers for the program
should call Shirley Peppers at the
Dean of Students Office, ext.
2733.

Tales are told of transfers
hitching from airports, only to
find the University closed on
week-ends, people beginning the
academic quarter in motel rooms
without transportation to campus,
and a few turning around and
going back from where they came.

Any former transfer can
probably fill in the account with
his own tales of woe.
Gradually these little slips in
communication are being worked
out by the pre-reg committee and
through the September
Clearinghouse, but much remains
to be done to integrate transfers
into university life.
A Needed Improvement
The volunteer program is one
more facet in improvement of the
transfers' lot.
The committee suggests
volunteers invite a new transfer to
dinner at the volunteer's
residence, invite him or her to any
dorm or university functions, be
available to answer questions, and
generally help the transfer
through the first few weeks of
school in a strange atmosphere.
The amount of time spent is up
to each student. The University
will reimburse students for a
limited number of meals during
the quarter. Students will be
matched by their interests,
academic or otherwise.
Volunteers for the program
should call Shirley Peppers at the
Dean of Students Office, ext.
2733.
