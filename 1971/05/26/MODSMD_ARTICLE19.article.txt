# PAC-8 Plans Two Divisions
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
At a meeting last week in
Seattle, the Pacific-8 schools
unanimously voted to restrict
conference play to the Northern
and Southern divisions in all
sports except football and
basketball.
This rule change serves only to
establish officially what has been
practiced in the Pac-8 for the past
few years. Economic
considerations have limited play
among the extreme northern and
southern schools in the
conference. Football and
basketball are the only sports that
have been able to provide enough
revenue to pay for the visiting
team's expenses.
Travel Expense
Many of the other sports,
notably track, have been losing
money because of the sharp
increase in travel expenses
incurred on long trips.
Responding to this financial crisis,
the schools removed any pressure
to compete with far flung
conference opponents.
Beginning next year, most
inter-divisional games will not
count in conference standings.
There will be some exceptions to
this rule, however, because some
schools have contractual
agreements that must be kept.
The Stanford swimming team is
committed to go north next
season and it has not been decided
yet whether the meet will affect
the Pac-8 standings.
Division Make-Up
The Southern division will
consist of USC, UCLA, Cal, and
Stanford. Washington, WSU,
Oregon, and Oregon State will
comprise the Northern division.
Stanford Athletic Director
Chuck Taylor assessed the impact
of the new ruling on Indian
sports. "We are fortunate because

our central location cuts down on
travelling costs, but the northern
schools were especially anxious to
limit play to divisions. Our
programs will not be significantly
affected with the exception of
baseball."
Coach Ray Young's baseball
team will have to replace its
normal six game schedule with
northern squads. The
diamondmen's schedule will
probably diminish next year in an

effort to hold down expenses. The
post-season baseball tournament
will not be held, and the
championship will be decided in a
game between the winners of the
two divisions.
The ruling will not bring a
total halt to competition between
the divisions, Taylor explained.
"If there is assurance that an
event will receive enough support
to pay for the visiting team's
expenses, we will schedule it."
