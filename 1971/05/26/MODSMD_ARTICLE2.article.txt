# Seale, Huggins
## Murder Charges Dropped 
### FRED MANN 
The presiding judge in the Bobby
Seale-Ericka Huggins
murder-kidnapping case yesterday
dismissed all charges against the two
defendants.
Claiming publicity surrounding the
trial would make it impossible to pick a
new impartial jury, Superior Court
Judge Harold M. Mulvey acted only 24
hours after the jury in the six-month
trial had given up, declaring itself
"hopelessly deadlocked."
The judge had accepted the jury's
statement and had declared a mistrial.
Huggins was immediately released,
and left the courtroom in tears. She
was mobbed by supporters who then
ran through the building laughing,
crying, and yelling.
She had been held in jail in
connection with the case for more than
two years.
Seale, co-founder of the Party,
reportedly was pleased with the
decision. He remained in custody,
pending appeal of his four-year
sentence for contempt of court at the
Chicago Seven conspiracy trial.
He has been in jail in Connecticut
for more than a year.
Seale and Huggins were two of 14
people charged in connection with the
death of Black Panther Alex Rackley in
May of 1969. The judge denied a
prosecution motion of appeal, and
under Connecticut law, the case is
dead. The defendants cannot be
reindicted.
Superhuman Effort
In announcing his unusual decision,

Judge Mulvey said, "With with massive
publicity attendant upon the trial just
completed, I find it impossible to
believe that an unbiased jury could be
selected without superhuman efforts
which this court, the state, and these
defendants should not be called upon
either to make or to endure."
The original selection of the jury for
the now-completed trial took four
months. The search virtually exhausted
the list of potential jurors.
Early yesterday, an unidentified
juror told the Associated Press that the
five black and seven white jurors had
been unanimously in favor of
acquitting Seale of all charges, but
during deliberation over the charges
against Huggins, some members
changed their minds. At the time they
finally gave up, the source indicated the
jury was nearly unanimous over a
verdict of innocent for both
defendants.
Unique Decision
Commenting on the decision, Paul
Halvonik, chief counsel of the Northern
California American Civil Liberties
Union said, "I've never seen anything
like it in my life."
Halvonik stated he assumed the
judge must have realized that the
prosecution did not have solid evidence
on which to convict the two. "I just
can't see a judge making a decision like
that if he felt the state had a substantial
case going," he said.
University attorney David Heilbron,
who has prosecuted numerous Stanford
radicals recently succeeded in obtaining
the injunction still in effect on campus

said, "This episode (the Seale decision)
plus the speedy acquittal of the
Panthers in New York two weeks ago
lends credence to what the Panthers are
saying is happening to them."
New Trend
Head of the Black Law Students
Association Jim Ware stated he believed
the acquittal of the New York Panthers
and now Seale and Huggins in New
Haven may have "set a trend." He was
doubtful however of the impact
yesterday's decision might have on the
Angela Davis-Ruchell Magee trial in
Marin County.
"Trial court decisions usually don't
have much impact outside of the state
in which they are made," he said. "And
the Angela Davis trial already smacks of
an attempt (by the prosecution) to
make sure everything is correct. They
are not going to allow the case to be
thrown out because of publicity."
Law student Walter Hunkler called
the dismissal of charges yesterday "a
tremendous victory," but felt the
decision would probably set no
precedent. "Probably the only thing
that will come of it will be an increased
use of the gag rule to limit publicity
surrounding trials," he said.

HILL FOR INDUSTRY—A new Motor Hotel-Restaurant to be placed in these rolling hills near SLAC is still "in the talking
stage" according to the university real estate office.
The presiding judge in the Bobby
Seale-Ericka Huggins
murder-kidnapping case yesterday
dismissed all charges against the two
defendants.
Claiming publicity surrounding the
trial would make it impossible to pick a
new impartial jury, Superior Court
Judge Harold M. Mulvey acted only 24
hours after the jury in the six-month
trial had given up, declaring itself
"hopelessly deadlocked."
The judge had accepted the jury's
statement and had declared a mistrial.
Huggins was immediately released,
and left the courtroom in tears. She
was mobbed by supporters who then
ran through the building laughing,
crying, and yelling.
She had been held in jail in
connection with the case for more than
two years.
Seale, co-founder of the Party,
reportedly was pleased with the
decision. He remained in custody,
pending appeal of his four-year
sentence for contempt of court at the
Chicago Seven conspiracy trial.
He has been in jail in Connecticut
for more than a year.
Seale and Huggins were two of 14
people charged in connection with the
death of Black Panther Alex Rackley in
May of 1969. The judge denied a
prosecution motion of appeal, and
under Connecticut law, the case is
dead. The defendants cannot be
reindicted.
Superhuman Effort
In announcing his unusual decision,

Judge Mulvey said, "With with massive
publicity attendant upon the trial just
completed, I find it impossible to
believe that an unbiased jury could be
selected without superhuman efforts
which this court, the state, and these
defendants should not be called upon
either to make or to endure."
The original selection of the jury for
the now-completed trial took four
months. The search virtually exhausted
the list of potential jurors.
Early yesterday, an unidentified
juror told the Associated Press that the
five black and seven white jurors had
been unanimously in favor of
acquitting Seale of all charges, but
during deliberation over the charges
against Huggins, some members
changed their minds. At the time they
finally gave up, the source indicated the
jury was nearly unanimous over a
verdict of innocent for both
defendants.
Unique Decision
Commenting on the decision, Paul
Halvonik, chief counsel of the Northern
California American Civil Liberties
Union said, "I've never seen anything
like it in my life."
Halvonik stated he assumed the
judge must have realized that the
prosecution did not have solid evidence
on which to convict the two. "I just
can't see a judge making a decision like
that if he felt the state had a substantial
case going," he said.
University attorney David Heilbron,
who has prosecuted numerous Stanford
radicals recently succeeded in obtaining
the injunction still in effect on campus

said, "This episode (the Seale decision)
plus the speedy acquittal of the
Panthers in New York two weeks ago
lends credence to what the Panthers are
saying is happening to them."
New Trend
Head of the Black Law Students
Association Jim Ware stated he believed
the acquittal of the New York Panthers
and now Seale and Huggins in New
Haven may have "set a trend." He was
doubtful however of the impact
yesterday's decision might have on the
Angela Davis-Ruchell Magee trial in
Marin County.
"Trial court decisions usually don't
have much impact outside of the state
in which they are made," he said. "And
the Angela Davis trial already smacks of
an attempt (by the prosecution) to
make sure everything is correct. They
are not going to allow the case to be
thrown out because of publicity."
Law student Walter Hunkler called
the dismissal of charges yesterday "a
tremendous victory," but felt the
decision would probably set no
precedent. "Probably the only thing
that will come of it will be an increased
use of the gag rule to limit publicity
surrounding trials," he said.
