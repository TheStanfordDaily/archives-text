# Women Gymnasts Set Pavilion Exhibition
## 
### 
The women's gymnastics
classes will be holding a
demonstration Thursday, May 27
at 4:30 p.m. in the Old Pavilion in
what will be their final program
this year.
The demonstration will consist
of group rhythmic gymnastics as
well as individual routines in the
four women's gymnastics events.
Free exercise combines
tumbling and dance moves set to
music. A routine is judged
according to its originality and
composition. The gymnast must
show flexibility and grace as well
as skill in executing some of the
more difficult tumbling moves.
Major vaults include layout
squats and straddles, handsprings,
and handspring variations.
Routines on the uneven
parallel bars consist of
continuous, swinging movements
between the two bars.
The balance beam, which is
four inches wide and four feet
high, is considered the most
difficult event in gymnastics.
Performers must execute dance
and tumbling movements
(cartwheels, handstands, rolls,
walkovers).

Dan Millman, the men's
gymnastics coach, will be doing
his sensational trampoline routine.
Girls gymnastics at Stanford
started five years ago under the
direction of Miss Heidi Klaus, one
of the main factors in the success
of gymnastics program here. In
the years she's been here, the
program has been expanded to
include four levels of gymnastics
class.
The gymnastics team had a
home meet in March this year and
also went to the Sacramento
Intercollegiate Competition where
Stanford placed first in the
advanced category.
Though gymnastics is a
rigorous and disciplined sport,
Miss Klaus conducts her classes
informally and stresses enjoyment
above all. Unfortunately this is
Miss Klaus's last year here and last
performance since she will be
returning to Germany this
summer.


THE SPLITSâ€”Candy Eggers hit the splits in one of her free exercise
routines earlier in the year. Women gymnasts will hold a
demonstration Thursday at 4:30 p.m. in the Old Pavilion.
