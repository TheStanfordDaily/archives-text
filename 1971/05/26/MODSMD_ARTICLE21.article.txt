## The 						Letdown 
### charlie hoffman 
A perusal of Monday's sports page was a depressing experience for
Stanford supporters. Every headline on the page informed the reader
of yet another sporting disaster. It became a creative challenge to
describe losing four different ways in the space allowed. "Bruins Win
Pac-8." "Trojans Upset Stanford In Tennis Semi-final." "Indians
Knocked Out of Playoff." "Crew Places Sixth In Western Sprints."
There are not words descriptive enough to give justice to the
disastrous culmination to the Indian's participation in the Pacific-B's
spring competition. The season is not over for some, however. The
golf team will probably get an invitation to the NCAA Championships
where they have recorded twin ninth place finishes in the last two
years. Coach Dick Gould plans to send a four man team to the
national collegiate tennis championships, and selected trackmen will
compete nationally in June.
Collapse Examined
Although Stanford has national hopes in golf, track, and tennis,
our collapse in Pac-8 championship play must be scrutinized. With the
exception of track, the Indian's spring squads have been in
contention. Yet when it comes time to vie for conference honors,
however, those evil teams from the south that get all the national
publicity always sneak in to spoil things.
The Trojans and Bruins, those darlings of Sports Illustrated,
perenially field excellent teams, and when it comes to Pac-8
competition, they are expected to win. More importantly, they expect
to win. It is difficult to compete against athletes who make the covers
of national magazines as sophomores and become folklore heroes.
National Image
To compound the problem, Stanford does not have a reputation as
an athletic power. Many people refuse to accept the fact that Stanford
beat Ohio State in the Rose Bowl and was ranked among the top ten
teams in the country. Next year's squad will have to go outandprove
to the country that it was not a fluke.
The point is that nobody expects Indian teams to win. Even when
this season's golf squad was the logical choice to win the Pac-8
tournament, most of the talk centered upon USC and Oregon. The
tennis team was supposed to breeze to the finals only to be sacrificed
to the Bruins. The baseball squad was slated to top all their opponents
on the way to sure defeat at the hands of the Trojans. Yet lowly WSU
proved that USC was not invincible but Stanford was not around to
absorb that "sure" defeat in the finals.
Support Needed
The Cards fielded highly respectable squads this season but most of
the talk surrounding the conference wind-ups had to do with the
"other" team. Indian squads were good enough to get far enough to
lose to the best. No hope was ever expressed that one of our teams
just might pull an upset. The press predicted a Stanford victory over
Cal's track team for a solid week before the meet and our athletes
were convinced that they could win. Indian sporting teams need more
of this kind of support and optimism in order to beat a few more of
the schools that are "supposed to win."
