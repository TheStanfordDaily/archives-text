# Bears Win In Two Overtimes, 6-5
## Laxmen Nearly Upset Cal 
### 
The Stanford Lacrosse team
almost spoiled Cal's bid for an
undefeated season as the Cards
battled through two overtimes
before the Bears triumphed, 6-5,
last Saturday at Cal's Strawberry
Canyon Field, concluding both
Stanford's and Cal's seasons.

Coach Bill Eakland's laxmen
had lost earlier to Cal by a four
goal margin but they were
determined to keep the Bears
from their first undefeated season.
"It was Stanford's best game of
the season," commented Eakland.
The Cards' co-captain Chip
Lovemann broke the scoring ice in
the first quarter. However, Cal
came back in the remainder of the
first half tallying three times to
lead, 3-1, with two quarters left.
In that first half Stanford had
little trouble with Cal's zone ride
defense and had several excellent
open goal opportunities. Although
some teams might have become
frustrated, the Card stickmen
"kept their poise and continually
pressured the highly touted Cal
team," according to Eakland.
In the third quarter both the
Indians and Bears played excellent
lacrosse. Cal was held scoreless.
In the final frame of regulation
play the hosts scored first. With
time running out for Stanford,
all-star senior Stuart Childs and
Peter Stoloff tallied on long shots
from mid-fiejd to send the game
into overtime.
The first overtime ended with

Cal on top, 5-4. Their goal was
scored with Stanford a man down
after a disputed call.
Cal upped the score to 6-4 in
the second overtime, but Stanford
came back and scored once. They
continued to pressure the Bear
defense, coming very close to
scoring on several occasions but
falling short at the end of the
extra period.
The loss cost Stanford the
Abercrombie and Fitch Broken
Stick Series, but had no effect on
their final standings.
For all but five members of the
Stanford squad the Lacrosse
season is over. Bill Eakland's
stickmen finished with a 9-5
record and a third place finish in
the Northern California Lacrosse
Association, the worst record in
five years for the team. Yet the
young team will return most of its
starters next year with only
captain Wade Killifer, defensman
Rod Lewis, and midfielder Stuart
Childs not returning next year.
Killfer and Childs, along with
sophomores Butch Hazelett, Paul
Tittmann, and Fred Choate will
travel to Los Angeles to play in
the North-South all-star game on
Saturday.


HIGH STICKINGâ€”Attack Chip Loveman takes to the air to block a clearing pass by the opposing goalie
as his teammates lend moral support. The Indians were bested by Cal, 6-5, last Saturday to end their
season.
