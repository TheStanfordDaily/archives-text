## Senate Nixes Draft Reform 
### 
WASHINGTON — The Senate refused yesterday to
bar the use of draftees for combat assignments in
Southeast Asia unless they volunteer.
The vote was 52 to 21 against the proposal by Sen.
Gaylord Nelson, D-Wis., who contended that "the
purpose of the draft is to implement national policy,
and national policy is to get out" of Vietnam.
Earlier, by an even more lopsided tally of 61 to 7,
the Senate rejected an amendment by Sen. John V.
Tunney, D-Calif., to bar the sending of draftees to
any combat area in the world unless they volunteer or
Congress authorizes it.
In the day's final vote, the Senate defeated, 49 to
25, a proposal by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.,
to eliminate the proposed combat enlistment bonus
of up to $6,000 over a two-year period.
Before Congress quits for the long Memorial Day
weekend, the Senate has scheduled votes today on
two major amendments: limiting draft extension to
18 months, instead of two years as contained in the
House-passed bill, and hiking proposed military pay
increases from the $1 billion in the bill to the $2.7
billion approved by the House.
