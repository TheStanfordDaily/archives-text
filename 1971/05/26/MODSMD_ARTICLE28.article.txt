# Calm Returns To Travis

TRAVIS AIR FORCE BASE - Maj. Gen. William G.
Moore, senior officer for this main air transport base
for Vietnam, said yesterday that a melee involving
about 600 men Monday night "is related to the
over-all U.S. racial dilemma."
While the base returned to normal operations
yesterday, security police guarded the burned
barracks and were in evidence elsewhere.
Air police and civilian officers ended fighting in
about three hours with the arrest of 135 men.
All but 89 were freed yesterday. A base
spokesman said 25 of those held were white, the
others black.
It was the third and largest outbreak in three
nights. There numerous minor injuries.
Moore, commanding the 22nd Air Force, which is
headquarter at Travis, told a news conference that
while the trouble was racially related, he knew of no
specific black grievances.
At the height of the disorders Monday night, a
civilian fireman died of what the Air Force said was
an apparent heart attack while fighting a fire which
swept a bachelor officers' quarters building.
Originally, the death was attributed to smoke
inhalation. Another fireman suffered facial burns.
A base spokesman, Lt. Dale Wilson, said damage
was estimated at about $5,000.
He said the fire apparently was set but was not

linked directly to the fighting.
Some 300 air police and 78 officers called in from
Napa and the Solano County sheriffs' offices and
other nearby towns quelled the disturbance shortly
after 11 p.m.
The officers blandished automatic weapons and
bayonetted rifles but no shots were fired and no tear
gas used.
Fighting among the men was mostly with fists but
with some clubs and thrown rocks, a spokesman said.
Several windows were broken by thrown r^ I '®
