# Berrigan Arraigned

### 
HARRISBURG, Pa. â€” The Rev. Philip Berrigan and
six other antiwar activists accused of conspiring to
kidnap presidential aid Henry Kissinger refused yesterday to
enter pleas at their arraignments in federal court.
Instead, Berrigan and the others tried
unsuccessfully to read statements saying, in effect,
that the only plea they would make would be for an
end to the Vietnam war.
Judge R. Dixon Herman of U.S. District Court cut
off the attempts and entered pleas of innocent on the
defendants' behalf.
"You are not telling me why you are not going to
plead, you are making a speech," the judge said in
interrupting Eqbal Ahmad, 40, a Pakistani graduate
student from Chicago, the first of the defendants to
be arraigned. "If you don't want to plead I will enter
a plea of not guilty for you."
The white-haired Berrigan appeared next and told
Herman, "My status is the same as Dr. Ahmad. I can't
relate to that indictment."
Berrigan, 47, had been brought here from a federal
prison at Danbury, Conn., where he is serving a
sentence for destroying draft board records in
Maryland.
