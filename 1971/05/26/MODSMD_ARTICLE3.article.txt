# Senate Focuses On Police, Court Hearing
## 
### 
ASSU President Doug McHenry told
the Student Senate last night that the
University Administration is ignoring
important questions in its
reorganization of the Campus Police.
McHenry stated that Associate
Provost Robert Rosenzweig considered
the primary responsibility of the
committee which is currently studying
reorganization of the police to be
finding a way to grant the security
guards peace officer status.
"This is not the most important
question," McHenry argued. "There are
much more important questions, such
as who will control the police (the
University or the Santa Clara County
Sheriff)?"
The Senate gave McHenry its
support in a meeting with President
Lyman on the matter tomorrow.
In other business, the Senate passed
a resolution urging that suspended
English Professor Bruce Franklin's
hearing before the Faculty Advisory
Board "be deferred until early in Fall
Quarter so that students and faculty
may have an unrestricted opportunity
to consider the details and
ramifications of this extremely
important case.
Senate Chairman Mike Dawson was
named Chairman of Pre-Registration

Commission. The Senate recommended
that he work closely with an existing
pre-registration committee which had
formed on its own initiative.
