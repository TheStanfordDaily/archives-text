CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. â€” Police and National
Guardsmen were ordered out of Negro areas of this
racially troubled city last night in a proposed
cooling-off period, but renewed reports of violence
resulted in their being sent back into some sections.
It was the fifth straight night of disorders which,
following a week of increasing racial tension, were
triggered Friday when a rock singer's refusal to
appear as scheduled sent young people on a rampage.
As black leaders pressed last night for a cooling-off
period, State Safety Commissioner Claude Armour
requested police and guardsmen to leave the Negro
public housing projects, where the outbreaks have
largely centered.
Police said firemen abandoned fighting two fires
because of what was described as sniper fire directed
at them. Police said that in both cases officers and
troops re-entered the areas to flush out the "snipers."
No injuries were reported.
The violence in the city of 119,000 has included
the shooting death of a young Negro by police.
Combatting the disorders have been about 1,500
guardsmen, 100 state troopers and 80 city police
officers.
