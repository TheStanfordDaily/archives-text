# Mayfield School Site
## University Plans Office Building 
### CRAIG NORDLUND News Analysis 
Conservationists and groups fighting
for low-cost housing on Stanford land
have lost their first battle to keep
industrial development from taking
over University property.
Emphasizing that decisions for the
use of the Mayfield School site on Page
Mill Road for an office building and the
Deer Creek Gulch area for a public golf
course were made before the
Livingston/Blayney report was released,
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice president
for finance, announced yesterday that
these parcels would be used for
commercial development instead of
low-cost housing or a day care center.
The University has already applied
for a zoning change in both areas. In a
letter sent to the City of Palo Alto
Planning Commission, Cuthbertson
stated that "Stanford University has a
proposal from a developer to lease the
property (corner of Page Mill and El
Camino) for an attractive commercial
development. .
In the past three open meetings of
the Committee on Land and Building
Development commercial use of the
Mayfield School has come under
very strong attack from surrounding
residents and conservation groups.
These groups have cited the already
severe traffic problem on this
intersection and have noted that the
soon-to-be completed Dillingham
Project will bring 1500 more people to
work in this already crowded area and
will increase traffic on El Camino by
8300 cars per day.

With housing already in very short
supply and automobiles in lethal
quantities, the community groups feel
that it is shortsighted and selfish for the
University to allow construction of
another large office building across
from Dillingham. The immediate
financial gain for the University will be
great ($1,000,000) but ten or twenty
years hence, they say, the sociological
and ecological cost to the community
may far surpass this figure.
The Deer Creek Gulch area near
Coyote Hill will be used for a public
golf course. This has been termed an
adequate compromise between income
and open space, but it does very little
toward easing the low cost housing
crisis.
Proposed Motor Hotel
Another "industry versus ecology"
crisis has evolved over the proposed
motor hotel-restaurant complex which
might be built as a "pump-primer" for
further industrial development on land
northwest of SLAC.
It would be constructed at Sand Hill
road and Junipero Serra freeway by Del
Monte Properties Company.
Cuthbertson said last week that Del
Monte representatives made the
proposal about nine months ago and
that it is still alive.
Boyd Smith, university real estate
manager, said the plan is "on the back
burner" until trustees settle land use
questions.
The spectre of a hotel and additional
factories and office buildings has raised
the ire of nearby residents who are

already opposed to construction of the
controversial Willow Expressway which
would run through the area.
The expressway would contribute to
industrial growth there, according to a
suppressed State Division of Highways
report on the road plans.
Overdevelopment
A spokesman for Project Dig-In,
which is committed to fighting
overdevelopment, said that that site
"should be used for either academic
reserve or low-moderate income
housing."
The Menlo Park Citizens Against the
Willow Expressway have adopted the
position of "no development, industrial
or otherwise," in the area of Sand Hill
Road and the freeway. Their perhaps
justifiable fear is that any industrial
development near the Junipero Serra
Freeway would necessitate a
connecting freeway link between
Interstate 280 and the Bayshore
Freeway.

If industrial development is not
halted and the Willow Freeway is built
the freeway will plow through 43:
units of already scarce low cost
housing. Aside from the additional
pollution created by a new freeway, the
housing loss will be "disastrous," the
citizens committee claims.
Vicious Circle
A vicious circle is developing in
which new industry brings in more
people who must live elsewhere because
they cannot find housing here in their
price range. Hence they commute to
work. This results in the need for more
freeways, more freeways mean more
industry and planned development
becomes uncontrolable
"overdevelopment."
If this spiral is not stopped soon say
the community action groups, the
Mid-Peninsula will become another Los
Angeles and its present beauty will be
destroyed.

A spokesman for Project Dig-In,
which is committed to fighting
overdevelopment, said that that site
"should be used for either academic
reserve or low-moderate income
housing."
The Menlo Park Citizens Against the
Willow Expressway have adopted the
position of "no development, industrial
or otherwise," in the area of Sand Hill
Road and the freeway. Their perhaps
justifiable fear is that any industrial
development near the Junipero Serra
Freeway would necessitate a
connecting freeway link between
Interstate 280 and the Bayshore
Freeway.

If industrial development is not
halted and the Willow Freeway is built
the freeway will plow through 43:
units of already scarce low cost
housing. Aside from the additional
pollution created by a new freeway, the
housing loss will be "disastrous," the
citizens committee claims.
Vicious Circle
A vicious circle is developing in
which new industry brings in more
people who must live elsewhere because
they cannot find housing here in their
price range. Hence they commute to
work. This results in the need for more
freeways, more freeways mean more
industry and planned development
becomes uncontrolable
"overdevelopment."
If this spiral is not stopped soon say
the community action groups, the
Mid-Peninsula will become another Los
Angeles and its present beauty will be
destroyed.
Conservationists and groups fighting
for low-cost housing on Stanford land
have lost their first battle to keep
industrial development from taking
over University property.
Emphasizing that decisions for the
use of the Mayfield School site on Page
Mill Road for an office building and the
Deer Creek Gulch area for a public golf
course were made before the
Livingston/Blayney report was released,
Kenneth Cuthbertson, vice president
for finance, announced yesterday that
these parcels would be used for
commercial development instead of
low-cost housing or a day care center.
The University has already applied
for a zoning change in both areas. In a
letter sent to the City of Palo Alto
Planning Commission, Cuthbertson
stated that "Stanford University has a
proposal from a developer to lease the
property (corner of Page Mill and El
Camino) for an attractive commercial
development. .
In the past three open meetings of
the Committee on Land and Building
Development commercial use of the
Mayfield School has come under
very strong attack from surrounding
residents and conservation groups.
These groups have cited the already
severe traffic problem on this
intersection and have noted that the
soon-to-be completed Dillingham
Project will bring 1500 more people to
work in this already crowded area and
will increase traffic on El Camino by
8300 cars per day.

With housing already in very short
supply and automobiles in lethal
quantities, the community groups feel
that it is shortsighted and selfish for the
University to allow construction of
another large office building across
from Dillingham. The immediate
financial gain for the University will be
great ($1,000,000) but ten or twenty
years hence, they say, the sociological
and ecological cost to the community
may far surpass this figure.
The Deer Creek Gulch area near
Coyote Hill will be used for a public
golf course. This has been termed an
adequate compromise between income
and open space, but it does very little
toward easing the low cost housing
crisis.
Proposed Motor Hotel
Another "industry versus ecology"
crisis has evolved over the proposed
motor hotel-restaurant complex which
might be built as a "pump-primer" for
further industrial development on land
northwest of SLAC.
It would be constructed at Sand Hill
road and Junipero Serra freeway by Del
Monte Properties Company.
Cuthbertson said last week that Del
Monte representatives made the
proposal about nine months ago and
that it is still alive.
Boyd Smith, university real estate
manager, said the plan is "on the back
burner" until trustees settle land use
questions.
The spectre of a hotel and additional
factories and office buildings has raised
the ire of nearby residents who are

already opposed to construction of the
controversial Willow Expressway which
would run through the area.
The expressway would contribute to
industrial growth there, according to a
suppressed State Division of Highways
report on the road plans.
