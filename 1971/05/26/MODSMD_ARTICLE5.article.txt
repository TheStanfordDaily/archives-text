Today's lesson in ancient history and irrelevant bygones: it is
suspected that on May 26, 800 years ago, Marco Polo split to
the Mongol Kingdom of Kublai Khan. Good riddance they
probably told him in Venice. Too bad his inspiration was
wasted on the soldiers sitting on Dunkerque beach, this day in
1940.
