A little-publicized election is facing the student
body today and tomorrow -one which was not
preceded with much fanfare and argument, yet one
which could end with the allocation of nearly
$50,000.
The inevitable danger of such a situation is that
only those who know about the proposals—usually
those who advocate them- bother to vote. We urge
all students to consider the propositions extremely
carefully, and then to vote-remember that $50,000
is at stake.
Our recommendations:
KZSU
During the past few years, when crisis became a
way of life, KZSU came fully into its own as a vital
communications medium on campus. It is the only
medium with the ability to convey the news as it
happens, and its staffers devote much of their time
and energy to providing just this sort of necessary
crisis coverage.
KZSU has also shown itself more and more
capable of providing this community-designed to
be a place for thought and debate-with public
service programming that recognizes its peculiar
needs. Airtime devoted to music, too, has markedly
improved, and the student D.J.'s have consistently
put together good musical programming.
Without this funding, KZSU's service will
undoubtedly fall short of the needs of this
community. Continuation of the technological
improvements the station has made this year will be
impossible. Whatever funding it can, get from tiie
University (probably $1000-$2000) alone will'not

allow it to adequately serve Stanford's needs. The
$12,000 you can vote them today will.
KZSU has already proved its worth. We urge a
YES vote on their $1 assessment for Fall Quarter.
LEGAL OFFENSE
The concept of students having their own legal
advocate is an excellent one. The proposition on the
ballot today is not the way to achieve it. It does not
specify how the students' lawyer is to be chosen, or
by whom.
It mentions specifically that he is to provide legal
aid for "members of the community," "the student
government, its officers, and subsidiary
organizations," and "all registered students." It
would seem that either he's going to be a very busy
person, or some individual or group will have to
make decisions about his priorities-whom he will
aid and when.
Before voting a large sum of money for this
lawyer, students should know exactly whom he is
serving. The criteria by which he will chose whom
to aid-particularly in the case of a dispute between
the groups listed in the ballot-should be clearly
specified. Under the present wording, this lawyer
could be used to the benefit of a very few students,
and the general student population would have no
access to him.
Students are being asked to vote $37,000 on the
faith that it will be put to use for their legal needs.
Although the idea it professes is praiseworthy, there
are too many unanswered questions about this
proposition. We urge a NO vote on the assessment
for Legal Offense.

which could end with the allocation of nearly
$50,000.
The inevitable danger of such a situation is that
only those who know about the proposals—usually
those who advocate them- bother to vote. We urge
all students to consider the propositions extremely
carefully, and then to vote-remember that $50,000
is at stake.
Our recommendations:
KZSU
During the past few years, when crisis became a
way of life, KZSU came fully into its own as a vital
communications medium on campus. It is the only
medium with the ability to convey the news as it
happens, and its staffers devote much of their time
and energy to providing just this sort of necessary
crisis coverage.
KZSU has also shown itself more and more
capable of providing this community-designed to
be a place for thought and debate-with public
service programming that recognizes its peculiar
needs. Airtime devoted to music, too, has markedly
improved, and the student D.J.'s have consistently
put together good musical programming.
Without this funding, KZSU's service will
undoubtedly fall short of the needs of this
community. Continuation of the technological
improvements the station has made this year will be
impossible. Whatever funding it can, get from tiie
University (probably $1000-$2000) alone will'not

allow it to adequately serve Stanford's needs. The
$12,000 you can vote them today will.
KZSU has already proved its worth. We urge a
YES vote on their $1 assessment for Fall Quarter.
LEGAL OFFENSE
The concept of students having their own legal
advocate is an excellent one. The proposition on the
ballot today is not the way to achieve it. It does not
specify how the students' lawyer is to be chosen, or
by whom.
It mentions specifically that he is to provide legal
aid for "members of the community," "the student
government, its officers, and subsidiary
organizations," and "all registered students." It
would seem that either he's going to be a very busy
person, or some individual or group will have to
make decisions about his priorities-whom he will
aid and when.
Before voting a large sum of money for this
lawyer, students should know exactly whom he is
serving. The criteria by which he will chose whom
to aid-particularly in the case of a dispute between
the groups listed in the ballot-should be clearly
specified. Under the present wording, this lawyer
could be used to the benefit of a very few students,
and the general student population would have no
access to him.
Students are being asked to vote $37,000 on the
faith that it will be put to use for their legal needs.
Although the idea it professes is praiseworthy, there
are too many unanswered questions about this
proposition. We urge a NO vote on the assessment
for Legal Offense.
A little-publicized election is facing the student
body today and tomorrow -one which was not
preceded with much fanfare and argument, yet one
which could end with the allocation of nearly
$50,000.
The inevitable danger of such a situation is that
only those who know about the proposals—usually
those who advocate them- bother to vote. We urge
all students to consider the propositions extremely
