# 1972 elections
## McCloskey Or Hatfield? 
### 
bill evers

The most important problem of the present time is ending the war
in Southeast Asia. Any political action must come down on one side
or the other of the question of war or peace. Similarly, members of
the academic community in deciding whom to cheer for, or whom to
vote for, in the 19 72 Presidential sweepstakes must make the
candidate's stand on the war the primary criterion.
In the two major political parties, the Republican and the
Democratic, two peace candidates stand out at the moment:
McCloskey and McGovern.
Of the current Democratic contenders, McGovern is preferable by
far. His position on the war is clear and unmistakable. Muskie and
Kennedy are both weaker in this realm. On the draft, McGovern
favors repeal, while Muskie and Kennedy favor extension. No
candidate better than McGovern appears likely to emerge from the
Democratic party.
In the Republican party, McCloskey is the only peace candidate
who has yet had the courage to take the plunge and declare himself an
anti-war candidate against Nixon. For this he deserves to be
commended and supported at present. Any decay of support for
Nixon's war policy within the Republican party will bring tremendous
pressure to bear on the President himself.
Much To Be Desired
Unfortunately, McCloskey in many ways leaves much to be
desired. He is the living embodiment of the Military Mind. When
North Korea seized the Pueblo, an American spy ship, McCloskey
favored declaring war against North Korea. McCloskey's experience
with the U.S. Marines appears to have had a decisive influence in the
formation of his character. In addition, he continues to adhere to the
myths and shibboleths of Cold War anti-Communism. He has come to
oppose the war primarily because of the widespread killing of
Vietnamese civilians.
On the draft, McCloskey's position is once again an example of the
Military Mind in action. On March 3,1971, he told the House Armed
Services Committee: ".. .it has always seemed to me that the
privileges and freedoms of being an American citizen justify two years
of service in times of war or threat to the national security .. . 'Duty,
honor, country' remain the words which underlie the strength of our
nation's armed services. Those who urge an end to the draft seem to
suggest that there be an end to 'duty' on the part of American
citizens."
There is a better Republican peace candidate: Senator Mark
Hatfield of Oregon. He has worked for in-depth reform of the code of
military justice, he co-sponsored the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment
to End the War, and year after year he has introduced legislation that
would repeal the draft.
'Vietnam—Our Colony'
In an article reviewing seven books on Vietnam for the July 1,
1 967 issue of Saturday Review, Hatfield wrote: "The word may seem
shocking, but Vietnam has become our colony."
In his speech at the University of California's 1969 Charter Day
ceremonies, Hatfield articulated an uncompromising and principled
stand on the draft:
"Prominent political liberals have advocated draft reform. To me,
that is like advocating slavery reform. We are asked to believe that the
lottery is an equitable compromise to the present draft law. Let me
ask you—what you you think of one who, during the last century,
advocated replacing slavery—which was involuntary servitude—with a
lottery system? Would that have changed the-matter any? Would that
have been a step toward justice? As far as the draft is concerned, I am
a committed abolitionist. I know that during their time, abolitionists
were considered too extreme, too radical; but I believe they were
right."
Potential support for a Hatfield candidacy would include the
Eugene McCarthy constituency (especially professors and students:
Hatfield is a former academician himself); the segments of the New
Left which subscribe to the thesis of Richard Barnett and Marcus
Raskin that America's global aggression can be traced to the power
lust of the National Security bureaucracy in Washington; and many of

the more individualistic members of the right wing, who supported
Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, but would like a return to the
non-interventionist foreign policy of Senator Robert A. Taft.
The major problems of America that a Hatfield candidacy could
and should address are (1) the Indochina war, (2) the draft, (3 ) police
harassment of youth and minority ethnic groups, and (4) the
increasing concentration of power in the hands of the central
government.
Furthermore, a Hatfield candidacy would be an occasion for
educating the vast tax-exploited middle class to the fact that they will
gain from a return to the libertarian principles of Jefferson's
Declaration of Independence.
Electoral politics is no cure-all. The political arena is, however, a
place where opponents of the war and proponents of a free society
can reach middle class citizens they can reach no other way. The 197 2
elections are an upcoming event whose outcome will affect us all.

Hatfield is a former academician himself); the segments of the New
Left which subscribe to the thesis of Richard Barnett and Marcus
Raskin that America's global aggression can be traced to the power
lust of the National Security bureaucracy in Washington; and many of

the more individualistic members of the right wing, who supported
Senator Barry Goldwater in 1964, but would like a return to the
non-interventionist foreign policy of Senator Robert A. Taft.
The major problems of America that a Hatfield candidacy could
and should address are (1) the Indochina war, (2) the draft, (3 ) police
harassment of youth and minority ethnic groups, and (4) the
increasing concentration of power in the hands of the central
government.
Furthermore, a Hatfield candidacy would be an occasion for
educating the vast tax-exploited middle class to the fact that they will
gain from a return to the libertarian principles of Jefferson's
Declaration of Independence.
Electoral politics is no cure-all. The political arena is, however, a
place where opponents of the war and proponents of a free society
can reach middle class citizens they can reach no other way. The 197 2
elections are an upcoming event whose outcome will affect us all.

The most important problem of the present time is ending the war
in Southeast Asia. Any political action must come down on one side
or the other of the question of war or peace. Similarly, members of
the academic community in deciding whom to cheer for, or whom to
vote for, in the 19 72 Presidential sweepstakes must make the
candidate's stand on the war the primary criterion.
In the two major political parties, the Republican and the
Democratic, two peace candidates stand out at the moment:
McCloskey and McGovern.
Of the current Democratic contenders, McGovern is preferable by
far. His position on the war is clear and unmistakable. Muskie and
Kennedy are both weaker in this realm. On the draft, McGovern
favors repeal, while Muskie and Kennedy favor extension. No
candidate better than McGovern appears likely to emerge from the
Democratic party.
In the Republican party, McCloskey is the only peace candidate
who has yet had the courage to take the plunge and declare himself an
anti-war candidate against Nixon. For this he deserves to be
commended and supported at present. Any decay of support for
Nixon's war policy within the Republican party will bring tremendous
pressure to bear on the President himself.
Much To Be Desired
Unfortunately, McCloskey in many ways leaves much to be
desired. He is the living embodiment of the Military Mind. When
North Korea seized the Pueblo, an American spy ship, McCloskey
favored declaring war against North Korea. McCloskey's experience
with the U.S. Marines appears to have had a decisive influence in the
formation of his character. In addition, he continues to adhere to the
myths and shibboleths of Cold War anti-Communism. He has come to
oppose the war primarily because of the widespread killing of
Vietnamese civilians.
On the draft, McCloskey's position is once again an example of the
Military Mind in action. On March 3,1971, he told the House Armed
Services Committee: ".. .it has always seemed to me that the
privileges and freedoms of being an American citizen justify two years
of service in times of war or threat to the national security .. . 'Duty,
honor, country' remain the words which underlie the strength of our
nation's armed services. Those who urge an end to the draft seem to
suggest that there be an end to 'duty' on the part of American
citizens."
There is a better Republican peace candidate: Senator Mark
Hatfield of Oregon. He has worked for in-depth reform of the code of
military justice, he co-sponsored the McGovern-Hatfield Amendment
to End the War, and year after year he has introduced legislation that
would repeal the draft.
'Vietnam—Our Colony'
In an article reviewing seven books on Vietnam for the July 1,
1 967 issue of Saturday Review, Hatfield wrote: "The word may seem
shocking, but Vietnam has become our colony."
In his speech at the University of California's 1969 Charter Day
ceremonies, Hatfield articulated an uncompromising and principled
stand on the draft:
"Prominent political liberals have advocated draft reform. To me,
that is like advocating slavery reform. We are asked to believe that the
lottery is an equitable compromise to the present draft law. Let me
ask you—what you you think of one who, during the last century,
advocated replacing slavery—which was involuntary servitude—with a
lottery system? Would that have changed the-matter any? Would that
have been a step toward justice? As far as the draft is concerned, I am
a committed abolitionist. I know that during their time, abolitionists
were considered too extreme, too radical; but I believe they were
right."
