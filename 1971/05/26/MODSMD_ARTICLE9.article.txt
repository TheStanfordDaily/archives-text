## Adult In A Child's World 
### 
► Charles burke

When we turn on our TV set for the eleven
o'clock news we find death and sadness:
Policemen slain, young black men murdered,
frustration, death—North Vietnamese atrocities,
our murders—maiming of the innocent caught in
the cross fire, kangaroo courts, prejudice,
economic and social, the grotesque spectre of sick
personalities and aggravated grievances acting out
their agonies in violence and emotional
verbage—where are we and what are we supposed
to do?
Am I supposed to hate the Fuzz, the blacks; am
I supposed to my own native nation, the
North Vietnamese or can I try to think these
things out without the emotional satisfaction of a
nice, pardon the pun, a black and white position.
More and more I feel that I and others around
me are confronted with the problem of being
adults in a child-parent world—Men rebel—the
children fighting to break the
politico-socio-economic chains of an established
order—parents in uniform enforce the law claiming
order as the atmosphere necessary for economic
growth and prosperity.
Back and forth, action and reaction—playing
the ancient human game of control and rebellion
and indulging something very basic and human in
us, the parent-child role dilemma—where do I fit?
Do I have the right to demand a place for an
adult—the chance to be looking for an answer to
peoples' problems—not the answer that satisfies
my emotions, but the answer that satisfies the
problem.
Can the adult community resist the combined
parent-child reaction? I have my doubts—and if we
can't, we are doomed to parent-child wars and
letting them, the parents and children, shape our
world. If the adult community can act for any
semblance of sanity, compromise and
communication we had best do so rapidly and

forcefully, because trying to move the immovable
object—the parents of our world—and the
irresistable force, the children, aspiring to
adulthood-but too often becoming repressive
parents themselves, will be no small job.
The adult community has the capacity to
channel the divergent groups toward a
task-oriented approach to socio-economic reform
and toward a balanced society. However,
interfering with others, retribution, xenophobia or
other causes more appealing to our instinctive
unconscious emotional energies are not part of the
adult bag.
As an adult I would be pleased to live a life free
of Cromwellian figures, 110 percenters,
superblacks, Mao Tse-tung, Hitler, Colonialists,
Zionists, Stalin, Jerry Rubin, Agnew, and hate
mongers in general; alive and free to enjoy the
diversity of experiences available in the relative
renaissance that we are witnessing in human
communications.
I feel sadly though that if the adult community
does not act soon, decisively and persistently we
shall find ourselves in another unbalanced
society—polarized- partisan--as in our own -and
perhaps worse.
It is not too late to inject a balance of reason
and love, once called Wisdom, into the human
community to stem the depersonalization of our
present system and the agonies of the existential
dilemma of our masses of socially striving peoples.
If we do not we, more than any other group,
shall suffer the coming repression or revolution
with its new class of oppressors. We must demand
a balanced community where all are relatively free
to think, create, grow and prosper without unduly
trampling on the right of others. If we do not we
shall justifiably suffer.
(Charles Burke is an alumnus of the class of
1968.)
