# Another Country Club?
## Vienna Campus Move Proposed 
### ROBIN STICKNEY 
Stanford's only urban overseas
campus may be in its last year.
The Sub-committee for
Stanford-in-Austria meets today to
decide whether the Austrian campus,
now located in downtown Vienna,
should be moved to suburban
Kahlenberg, 45 minutes travelling time
from the city.
The Vienna campus has suffered a
decline in applicants over the past year,
and the Overseas Campus Board is
searching for solutions to the problem.
Members of the sub-committee are
concerned about the loss of the urban
campus. There are advantages in Vienna
which are unique. "You work outside
your door and you're faced with an
abundance of things," commented Joel
Hyatt, a member of Austria X. "The
campus is only a block away from the
opera and theatre."
Part of Problem
There is an International Cultural
Center and a theatre group located in
the campus building, and a group of
Austrian students living on the fourth
floor. These non-Stanford activities are
sometimes cited as part of the problem.

Also, the Austrian food service,
operated by an Austrian concern,
Caritas, is expensive.
It is hoped that the move to
Kahlenberg would alleviate student
complaints about the small
accommodations, the noise, and the
heat in summer.
A questionnaire filled out by
students considering overseas campuses
indicated that many would hesitate to
choose Vienna, although most
returnees agree that the city location is
to be preferred.
Country Club
"Kahlenberg falls in line with other
overseas campuses . .. like a country
club. Maybe Stanford students like
that," says Hyatt.
"For the California student, it has
the big green fields where you can play
frisbee ..."
North of Vienna, on the Danube,
Kahlenberg has all the advantages of
the country. The rooms are more
attractive than in Vienna, and the
operation will be run completely by
Stanford.
Less Spaces
Kahlenberg has only 60 places

available, instead of the 80 at the
Viennese "Interstadt." According to
Robert Walker, Director of the
Overseas Campus program, the fall in
enrollment is a serious problem, and
the question of finances is a major
concern.
Other plans have been proposed,
including the implementation of a
family program and the appointment of
a full-time cultural chairman. Mrs.
Hersche V. Allen, Assistant Director of
Overseas Campuses, says, "We are
trying to strengthen and put substance
back into the program. These are the
kinds of questions which are
confronting the people making the
decisions."

TRANSPLANT?â€”The Stanford overseas campus in Austria, which, up until now has been thriving in the heart of Vienna's
red light district, may be transplanted to a quiet rural setting. Today's meeting will determine whether or not efforts to keep
the campus in Vienna's main artery will be in vain.
