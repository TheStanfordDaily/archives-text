## University's Social Function 
### 
Tina swent

When one examines the
University as it functions within
the whole of society, the conflict
between the myth of the
academic community and the
reality of the education
corporation becomes obvious.
In our mythology, the
University is the only place where
truth and knowledge are pursued
untainted by instrumental
motives; it is at once the
storehouse of accumulated truth
and culture and the center for
ongoing examination; it is the
place where people receive the
intellectual, critical skills that
make them the "informed citizens
on which a democracy depends."
But of course the University is
an intellectual construct and its
mythology bears very little
relationship to the
multi-dimensional reality. Ask the
staff and workers what the
University means to them—it is
just a non-union employer who
pays less than other Palo Alto
employers (particularly for
women and less-skilled workers),
has little or no job security, and
no unemployment compensation
program.
We see that to assert that pure
truth and knowledge are pursued

here without any instrumental
motives is simply fatuous. To
avoid mythology, we must ask
who in America benefits from
having universities as presently
constituted? Who does the
University serve? (The
government does not bankroll
anything out of disinterested
benevolence!)
War Effort
It serves the war effort through
ROTC (yes, it is still here) and
research which has the effect of
technologically continuing and
expanding the war. It serves the
national policy makers by
providing them with social
scientists and resources which are
used often in imperialistic ways
despite and against community
knowledge or needs.
By posing as the single
repository of truth and
knowledge, it cultivates elitist
attitudes on the part of the
academicians and students,
thereby maintaining and
strengthening the same class
structure.
If the university is at a
cross-roads of change, then it is
also at a crisis of identity, and the
model that is chosen will
determine the change that occurs.
Institutional Coattails
For a while, perhaps,
innovative and challenging
programs such as SWOPSI and
SCIRE can ride Stanford's
institutional coattails by
piecemeal collection of funds and
energy. Thus even while certain
professors do consulting for
conglomerate corporations
responsible for massive
exploitation of labor in the Third
World and pollution world-wide,
still a small group of students
studies ways to restrict those
pollutants.
Challenging and creative
programs can run on extra energy
internal to the university only as
long as they remain peripheral in
their requests and effects. Witness
the present crisis over control of
these programs.
The impossibility of significant
internal reform (i.e., within the
present conceptual, financial, and

service structure) is made clearer
when one considers some of the
analogies between the operations
of corporations and universities.
A guiding principle of
corporate law and business
organizations is that of
management prerogatives. That is,
investment decisions are made
solely by the men in control in
both instances. And what
corporations decide to produce is
management prerogative.
Final Control
That product may be damaging
to the health of the workers who
make it; it may be something
which, if the American people
held a national referendum, no
one would want produced; but
the management of the company
has final control.
In the university, similarly, no
person or constituency has
legitimate standing to question
what sort of work—teaching,
research, consulting, and land
use—is being done and for whom.
Growth Dominant
Again, the dominant motif in
American corporate history since
World War II has been that of
growth. We see this phenomenon
operating also at Stanford.
Stanford seems intent on
maintaining and expanding its
physical assets, a program that
began with the PACE program in
the 196 o 's, in selected areas:
various engineering, business and
other professional facilities.
The emphasis seems to be on
Build! Build! what will attract
more money and longer term
professional prestige to Stanford.
While construction escalates,
budgets for services, academic
programs, and workers' jobs are
cut back.
Chinese Experience
The role the university serves
in strengthening elitist attitudes
also limits the possibility of
internally generated change. The
Chinese experience is instructive
here. In China, people go to the
university after they have had the
kinds of work experience which
enable them to understand the
needs of their people and their
productive enterprises. Local

communities decide what skills
are needed and who is best
qualified to learn and then
transmit those skills.
In America, we have an inverse,
top-down approach; one must go
to college to get the credentials
and status to identify the "real
needs" of America (whether
educational, industrial,
distributive or social services).
Unconscious Elitism
But perhaps the worst part of
the unconscious elitism we
acquire can be traced back to the
mythology of the university. If
the university is the one
institution in America where truth
can be pursued and attention can
be devoted to gaining an overview
of the society, what does that say
about conditions in America?
It indicates an assumption that
non-academic people live by
blindly consuming, passively
accepting, lacking the ability to
question or understand their
work. This assumption is as much
a myth as our image of the
university, but both of them are
damaging in their acceptance.
To be concerned only with the
preservation-through-change of
the university is to misunderstand
our concern. We must devote
ourselves to creating the
conditions where what is positive
is part of the life of all people.
And we must rid ourselves of our
elitist assumption that only those
who have a degree can understand
what is happening here and what
America needs.
Mythology
In spite of the ego-satisfying
mythology which the university
feeds to its students and
academicians, the college
professionals must begin to realize
that they are not the only ones
qualified to make decisions.
This is not to say that we
should not direct our attention
toward Stanford. But the
university is organically linked
with the rest of society. We must
change the model for the social
function of the university if we
want to change its final product.
