## Mass Registration Necessary 
###

Last year the Supreme Court in a five to
four decision ruled that 18-21-year-olds could
vote in the national elections. With this
decision the Court substantially altered the
equation for electorial success in the American
political arena. Exactly what variables were
changed and in what magnitudes is the
question which presidential campaign
strategists are now scratching their heads over.
The question is of no small political
consequence. Eighteen and a half million
youthful voters will be eligible for the next
presidential elections. Of this figure eleven and
one half million will be between the ages of 18
and 21, and seven million will be 21 or 22. If
this group of younger voters were to cast their
ballots greatly in favor of one presidential
candidate then they could possible determine
the fate of the 1972 elections.
Liquor, Yes; Voting, No
Recently Representative Gerald Ford,
addressing a political science course here,
responded to the question of how he assessed
the effects of the 18-21 year old vote by
pointing out that, in his home state, 21 year
olds have consistently remembered to apply
for their liquor identification card needed to
purchase alcholic beverages in Michigan, but
generally have forgotten to register to vote.
Extrapolating upon this he went on to say
that he anticipated the new voters would have
little intluence on the final outcome of the
1972 elections. Many political strategists
especially in the Nixon camp have agreed with

this conclusion. The relatively low numbers of
18-21 year olds who have registered to date
has reinforced this contention.
Heed Opinions
With the new Supreme Court decision, we
as young people in America, now possess the
ability to force politicians like Gerald Ford and
Richard Nixon to heed our opinions.
If the youth of this country sincerely
desires to end the Vietnam War and get on
with solving the problems of America, then we
mu>t demonstrate to presidential contenders
of all political persuasions that we will not
tolerate further United States military
involvement in Southeast Asia.
The most effective means for proving our
convictions and the one means that politicans
truly understand is to register and vote in
mass. Studies conducted on voting patterns of
senators and representatives reveal that these
law makers generally vote in accordance with
their perception of constituent public opinion.
Future Issues
By registering in mass and making our
opposition to the war known, we may
significantly affect the perceptions of our
legislators on future votes which are critical to
the continuation of the Vietnam War, like the
Selective Services Act and Military
Appropriations bill.
Furthermore, we will demonstrate to
Democrat and Republican strategists alike that
the 18-24 year old vote is not to be written off

as insignificant.
In order to demonstrate our determination
and to gain political clout, it is critically
important that those students returning to
their homes for the summer go to their local
county clerks and register. In fact, students
who are sincerely interested in increasing the
impact of 18-21-year-olds should become
deputy registrars and promote voting drives at
local state colleges. Students interested in
becoming deputy registrars should inquire at
their local county clerks.
Register Movements
Movements to register the 18-21 year old
vote are getting underway now. The public
interest group, Common Cause, is supporting
registration drives on this campus.
This summer many students will return to
the "real world" of corporate enterprise to
type letters, sell towels, and program
computers. Whether they will register to vote
or attempt to become deputy registrars is yet
to be seen. The political fact remains, however,
that during the 1960's two presidential
elections were decided by less than one million
votes. The likelihood of similar occurences in
the 1970's is great.
It will be a tragedy, indeed, if future
historians record that student political apathy
in 1972 permitted four more years of war to
take place in Southeast Asia.

WHY IS THIS MAN SMIL
ING?â€”WeII, His name is Paul
Conrad, and he may be smiling
because he just received his
second Pulitzer Prize for his
editorial cartoons. Or perhaps he's
smiling because he just received
his royalty check from the

back on our pages next fall and
with some drawing lessons, you
could be on it, too.
