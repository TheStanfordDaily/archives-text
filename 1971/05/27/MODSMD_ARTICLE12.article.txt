Editor, THE DAILY:
We feel compelled by Mr.
Casey's letter of May 26 to state
more clearly our reasons for
voting for his removal from the
Presidency of the Young
Republicans.
During Mr. Casey's term as
membership chairman he
deliberately withheld full
information listed on club
membership forms to President
Roman Buhler. Casey explained
to Mr. Buhler after last Thursday's
election that this information
might have made Mr. Buhler "too
powerful." Ignoring the unethical
implications such action is a
violation of our constitution
which makes officers responsible
to the President.
Mr. Casey got himself elected
by concealing his candidacy from
all but a few of his YR friends in
the Business School and packing
the election meeting with those
same members. Mr. Casey
apparently sees the election
process as a manipulative tool for
gaining power rather than as a
form for expressing the will of the
club membership.
Mr. Casey's deliberate,
prepared statement that
Republican Congressman
McCloskey "is unwittingly
echoing Radio Hanoi with his
attacks of American motives and
tactics in Indochina" was only the
last straw; in a series of actions
that led us to believe "that it is
neither proper nor in the best
interests of the club for Mr. Casey
to serve as President."
We are all willing to work and
have already begun sending out
invitations to Republican speakers
for next fall, but we prefer to
work under an ethical leadership
that does not use its status to
make narrow, devisive and
irresponsible statements about
other Republicans. We found
evidence that many of our fellow
members considered Mr. Casey's
statements incompatible with
their continued membership in
the club.
If so many students had been
willing to work with Mr. Casey we
wonder why he could only find
two fellow business students to

run for office at the election. It is
also strange that after six months
as membership chairman, Mr.
Casey still does not know his own
membership outside the Business
School and had to depend on the
past President to find willing
workers for the executive board.
Since Monday's meet : ng, other
factors have reinforced our
opinion that Mr. Casey should be
removed. In the present edition of
the Stanford Observer, published
before the election, he has signed
his name President, Stanford GSB
Young Republicans.
Not only did he tell no one on
the Board about his little
"enterprise," but by using the YR
name without any authorization
he may be liable for suit by the
Californian Young Republicans
Incorporated.
Most important in our view
however are Mr. Casey and Mr.
Neubauer's statements in the
Daily on the legal status of our
actions. There is abundant
evidence that these statements are
simply not true.
1. That the meeting was not an
official meeting of the YR
executive board, during a
telephone conversation between
Mr. Casey and Mr. Buhler last
Saturday, Mr. Buhler asked if the
meeting Monday would be a
meeting of the executive board.
Mr. Casey replied "Yes." A notice
as to the time and place of the
meeting appeared in the GSB
Newsletter of Monday, May 24.
2. That the members of the
executive board who voted to
impeach Mr. Casey were not
actually appointed by him; every
member of the executive board
must have heard Mr. Buhler's
query at the meeting. "Well, are
they all appointed?" Mr. Casey's
reply, "Well, certainly."
Significantly at the meeting, Mr.
Casey chose to walk out rather
than challenge the validity of his
appointments that he "vigorously
denies" making in the Daily.
The Executive Board has
scheduled a second meeting for
7:30 June 1 at which Mr. Casey
will be given further opportunity
to defend himself and a final vote
on his removal will take place.

land use
Editor, THE DAILY:
Craig Nordlund's story about
Stanford's applications for zoning
actions that would make land
available for a public golf course
near Coyote Hill and for general
commercial use on El Camino
Real overlooked several important
points that I would like to make
at this time.
1. Both actions were proposed
before the Livingston and Blayney
report was undertaken. Asked
about them specifically,
Livingston and Blayney found
them to be appropriate uses of the
lands in question. The golf course
would be "an ideal buffer"
between Coyote Hill and a
proposed open space area of 190
acres to the south, they said,
while the El Camino site — a small
island surrounded by commercial
property — should be used for
office development.
2. Stanford proposes to take
22 acres of land out of research
park use for the golf course (along
with 32 other acres now in the
county), while asking that four
acres on El Camino be made
available for commercial use.
3. The zoning requested for the
Mayfield School site is exactly the
same as the zoning on all other El
Camino frontage in Palo Alto that
is not in public or educational use.
4. The University Committee
on Land and Building
Development, made up of six
faculty members, two staff
members and three student
representatives, approved both
requests after full discussions of
the traffic and housing
implications.
The requests will now be
considered by the Palo Alto

Planning Commission and City
Council. Those bodies will decide
if the Mayfield site, off the tax
rolls while in school use, should
be returned to the tax rolls now
that the Palo Alto Unified School
District no longer needs the
property.
5. The Sand Hill Road motel,
allegedly needed as a "pump
primer" for industrial
development in that area, is a
straw dummy. To begin with,
nearby land already is zoned for
light manufacturing, and could be
leased tomorrow with or without
a motel.
Secondly, the proposed motel
is not even under discussion, nor
is it at all certain that the
University would like one at that
site. Thirdly, no action of any
kind along Sand Hill Road is
contemplated until after the
Trustees reach basic land use
decisions next fall.
Let me reiterate in closing that
Stanford cannot do whatever it
wishes with its lands, no matter
how appropriate the proposed use
may be, nor how much Stanford
needs the income. Local
jurisdictions can, and do,
determine Stanford land use
through their own zoning,
annexation and subdivision
actions, all of which require
public hearings by two separate
bodies.
If the University's proposals
are as unreasonable as some critics
charge — a point that I strongly
dispute — those bodies will
consider those charges during
their deliberations in behalf of the
public's best interests.

report was undertaken. Asked
about them specifically,
Livingston and Blayney found
them to be appropriate uses of the
lands in question. The golf course
would be "an ideal buffer"
between Coyote Hill and a
proposed open space area of 190
acres to the south, they said,
while the El Camino site — a small
island surrounded by commercial
property — should be used for
office development.
2. Stanford proposes to take
22 acres of land out of research
park use for the golf course (along
with 32 other acres now in the
county), while asking that four
acres on El Camino be made
available for commercial use.
3. The zoning requested for the
Mayfield School site is exactly the
same as the zoning on all other El
Camino frontage in Palo Alto that
is not in public or educational use.
4. The University Committee
on Land and Building
Development, made up of six
faculty members, two staff
members and three student
representatives, approved both
requests after full discussions of
the traffic and housing
implications.
The requests will now be
considered by the Palo Alto

Planning Commission and City
Council. Those bodies will decide
if the Mayfield site, off the tax
rolls while in school use, should
be returned to the tax rolls now
that the Palo Alto Unified School
District no longer needs the
property.
5. The Sand Hill Road motel,
allegedly needed as a "pump
primer" for industrial
development in that area, is a
straw dummy. To begin with,
nearby land already is zoned for
light manufacturing, and could be
leased tomorrow with or without
a motel.
Secondly, the proposed motel
is not even under discussion, nor
is it at all certain that the
University would like one at that
site. Thirdly, no action of any
kind along Sand Hill Road is
contemplated until after the
Trustees reach basic land use
decisions next fall.
Let me reiterate in closing that
Stanford cannot do whatever it
wishes with its lands, no matter
how appropriate the proposed use
may be, nor how much Stanford
needs the income. Local
jurisdictions can, and do,
determine Stanford land use
through their own zoning,
annexation and subdivision
actions, all of which require
public hearings by two separate
bodies.
If the University's proposals
are as unreasonable as some critics
charge — a point that I strongly
dispute — those bodies will
consider those charges during
their deliberations in behalf of the
public's best interests.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We feel compelled by Mr.
Casey's letter of May 26 to state
more clearly our reasons for
voting for his removal from the
Presidency of the Young
Republicans.
During Mr. Casey's term as
membership chairman he
deliberately withheld full
information listed on club
membership forms to President
Roman Buhler. Casey explained
to Mr. Buhler after last Thursday's
election that this information
might have made Mr. Buhler "too
powerful." Ignoring the unethical
implications such action is a
violation of our constitution
which makes officers responsible
to the President.
Mr. Casey got himself elected
by concealing his candidacy from
all but a few of his YR friends in
the Business School and packing
the election meeting with those
same members. Mr. Casey
apparently sees the election
process as a manipulative tool for
gaining power rather than as a
form for expressing the will of the
club membership.
Mr. Casey's deliberate,
prepared statement that
Republican Congressman
McCloskey "is unwittingly
echoing Radio Hanoi with his
attacks of American motives and
tactics in Indochina" was only the
last straw; in a series of actions
that led us to believe "that it is
neither proper nor in the best
interests of the club for Mr. Casey
to serve as President."
We are all willing to work and
have already begun sending out
invitations to Republican speakers
for next fall, but we prefer to
work under an ethical leadership
that does not use its status to
make narrow, devisive and
irresponsible statements about
other Republicans. We found
evidence that many of our fellow
members considered Mr. Casey's
statements incompatible with
their continued membership in
the club.
If so many students had been
willing to work with Mr. Casey we
wonder why he could only find
two fellow business students to

run for office at the election. It is
also strange that after six months
as membership chairman, Mr.
Casey still does not know his own
membership outside the Business
School and had to depend on the
past President to find willing
workers for the executive board.
Since Monday's meet : ng, other
factors have reinforced our
opinion that Mr. Casey should be
removed. In the present edition of
the Stanford Observer, published
before the election, he has signed
his name President, Stanford GSB
Young Republicans.
Not only did he tell no one on
the Board about his little
"enterprise," but by using the YR
name without any authorization
he may be liable for suit by the
Californian Young Republicans
Incorporated.
Most important in our view
however are Mr. Casey and Mr.
Neubauer's statements in the
Daily on the legal status of our
actions. There is abundant
evidence that these statements are
simply not true.
1. That the meeting was not an
official meeting of the YR
executive board, during a
telephone conversation between
Mr. Casey and Mr. Buhler last
Saturday, Mr. Buhler asked if the
meeting Monday would be a
meeting of the executive board.
Mr. Casey replied "Yes." A notice
as to the time and place of the
meeting appeared in the GSB
Newsletter of Monday, May 24.
2. That the members of the
executive board who voted to
impeach Mr. Casey were not
actually appointed by him; every
member of the executive board
must have heard Mr. Buhler's
query at the meeting. "Well, are
they all appointed?" Mr. Casey's
reply, "Well, certainly."
Significantly at the meeting, Mr.
Casey chose to walk out rather
than challenge the validity of his
appointments that he "vigorously
denies" making in the Daily.
The Executive Board has
scheduled a second meeting for
7:30 June 1 at which Mr. Casey
will be given further opportunity
to defend himself and a final vote
on his removal will take place.

two fellow business students to

run for office at the election. It is
also strange that after six months
as membership chairman, Mr.
Casey still does not know his own
membership outside the Business
School and had to depend on the
past President to find willing
workers for the executive board.
Since Monday's meet : ng, other
factors have reinforced our
opinion that Mr. Casey should be
removed. In the present edition of
the Stanford Observer, published
before the election, he has signed
his name President, Stanford GSB
Young Republicans.
Not only did he tell no one on
the Board about his little
"enterprise," but by using the YR
name without any authorization
he may be liable for suit by the
Californian Young Republicans
Incorporated.
Most important in our view
however are Mr. Casey and Mr.
Neubauer's statements in the
Daily on the legal status of our
actions. There is abundant
evidence that these statements are
simply not true.
1. That the meeting was not an
official meeting of the YR
executive board, during a
telephone conversation between
Mr. Casey and Mr. Buhler last
Saturday, Mr. Buhler asked if the
meeting Monday would be a
meeting of the executive board.
Mr. Casey replied "Yes." A notice
as to the time and place of the
meeting appeared in the GSB
Newsletter of Monday, May 24.
2. That the members of the
executive board who voted to
impeach Mr. Casey were not
actually appointed by him; every
member of the executive board
must have heard Mr. Buhler's
query at the meeting. "Well, are
they all appointed?" Mr. Casey's
reply, "Well, certainly."
Significantly at the meeting, Mr.
Casey chose to walk out rather
than challenge the validity of his
appointments that he "vigorously
denies" making in the Daily.
The Executive Board has
scheduled a second meeting for
7:30 June 1 at which Mr. Casey
will be given further opportunity
to defend himself and a final vote
on his removal will take place.

land use
Editor, THE DAILY:
Craig Nordlund's story about
Stanford's applications for zoning
actions that would make land
available for a public golf course
near Coyote Hill and for general
commercial use on El Camino
Real overlooked several important
points that I would like to make
at this time.
1. Both actions were proposed
before the Livingston and Blayney
report was undertaken. Asked
about them specifically,
Livingston and Blayney found
them to be appropriate uses of the
lands in question. The golf course
would be "an ideal buffer"
between Coyote Hill and a
proposed open space area of 190
acres to the south, they said,
while the El Camino site — a small
island surrounded by commercial
property — should be used for
office development.
2. Stanford proposes to take
22 acres of land out of research
park use for the golf course (along
with 32 other acres now in the
county), while asking that four
acres on El Camino be made
available for commercial use.
3. The zoning requested for the
Mayfield School site is exactly the
same as the zoning on all other El
Camino frontage in Palo Alto that
is not in public or educational use.
4. The University Committee
on Land and Building
Development, made up of six
faculty members, two staff
members and three student
representatives, approved both
requests after full discussions of
the traffic and housing
implications.
The requests will now be
considered by the Palo Alto

Planning Commission and City
Council. Those bodies will decide
if the Mayfield site, off the tax
rolls while in school use, should
be returned to the tax rolls now
that the Palo Alto Unified School
District no longer needs the
property.
5. The Sand Hill Road motel,
allegedly needed as a "pump
primer" for industrial
development in that area, is a
straw dummy. To begin with,
nearby land already is zoned for
light manufacturing, and could be
leased tomorrow with or without
a motel.
Secondly, the proposed motel
is not even under discussion, nor
is it at all certain that the
University would like one at that
site. Thirdly, no action of any
kind along Sand Hill Road is
contemplated until after the
Trustees reach basic land use
decisions next fall.
Let me reiterate in closing that
Stanford cannot do whatever it
wishes with its lands, no matter
how appropriate the proposed use
may be, nor how much Stanford
needs the income. Local
jurisdictions can, and do,
determine Stanford land use
through their own zoning,
annexation and subdivision
actions, all of which require
public hearings by two separate
bodies.
If the University's proposals
are as unreasonable as some critics
charge — a point that I strongly
dispute — those bodies will
consider those charges during
their deliberations in behalf of the
public's best interests.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We feel compelled by Mr.
Casey's letter of May 26 to state
more clearly our reasons for
voting for his removal from the
Presidency of the Young
Republicans.
During Mr. Casey's term as
membership chairman he
deliberately withheld full
information listed on club
membership forms to President
Roman Buhler. Casey explained
to Mr. Buhler after last Thursday's
election that this information
might have made Mr. Buhler "too
powerful." Ignoring the unethical
implications such action is a
violation of our constitution
which makes officers responsible
to the President.
Mr. Casey got himself elected
by concealing his candidacy from
all but a few of his YR friends in
the Business School and packing
the election meeting with those
same members. Mr. Casey
apparently sees the election
process as a manipulative tool for
gaining power rather than as a
form for expressing the will of the
club membership.
Mr. Casey's deliberate,
prepared statement that
Republican Congressman
McCloskey "is unwittingly
echoing Radio Hanoi with his
attacks of American motives and
tactics in Indochina" was only the
last straw; in a series of actions
that led us to believe "that it is
neither proper nor in the best
interests of the club for Mr. Casey
to serve as President."
We are all willing to work and
have already begun sending out
invitations to Republican speakers
for next fall, but we prefer to
work under an ethical leadership
that does not use its status to
make narrow, devisive and
irresponsible statements about
other Republicans. We found
evidence that many of our fellow
members considered Mr. Casey's
statements incompatible with
their continued membership in
the club.
If so many students had been
willing to work with Mr. Casey we
wonder why he could only find
two fellow business students to

run for office at the election. It is
also strange that after six months
as membership chairman, Mr.
Casey still does not know his own
membership outside the Business
