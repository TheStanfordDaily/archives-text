# In Your Ear Gives Lift In Local

### LODI 
The ever-changing corner of University Avenue and High Street in
downtown Palo Alto has sprung to life once again with still another
music club attempting to establish the Stanford area as a community
able to draw first-rate entertainment.
And the new proprietors include two University law school
students, Jim Rummonds and Nick Clainos.
Following the demise of the Poppycock and just recently
Mom's—both live entertainment clubs—comes a third pretender to the
rock and folk music throne in the area. It is called In Your Ear, and it
promises to be the most successful of the three.
Citing a lack of commitment to good entertainment as the main
reason for the death of both of its predecessors, the management of In
Your Ear claims it will reverse the trend. Already booked for June
10-13 are Sunny Terry and Brownie McGee plus the Sam McGowan
Band.
Styling itself after successful clubs in San Francisco such as
Keystone Korner and The Matrix, the Palo Alto club has made
physical improvements in the building, hoping to make it a spot in
which popular entertainers would want to play when they arrive in
the Bay Area.
These improvements include building furnished band rooms in the
basement, doubling the size of the stage, and installing a ticket booth
outside the building. "We want to make it a performer's club," they
said, "a place where a name act will dig playing."
The door charge is $2 for all acts, and although the club is now
open only Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights, In Your Ear hopes
to operate more regularly before long.
Last weekend's opening engagement featured Shanti, an East
Indian rock group, Festival of Light, and Top Soil. Tonight through
Saturday, the club will present Gideon and Power plus The Real
Charles Ford Band. Music starts at 9 :00 p.m.
