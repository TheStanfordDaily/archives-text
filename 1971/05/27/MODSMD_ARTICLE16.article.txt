# Stanford Harbors Toy ROTC Fleet
## 
### KATHY MORTON 
Now hear this! The University
harbors a bathtub fleet, and it
doesn't sail on Lake Lag.
Tucked away behind Encina
Commons is a small building
(formerly a garbage shack)
containing a shallow pool, 16' x
20', a radio control transmitter,
and two small model ships
resembling U.S. Navy destroyer
escorts. This "toy" is one of the
Navy's latest training aids.
Here, in the safety of a
controlled environment, NROTC
midshipmen practice maneuvers.
The ships, each about three feet in
length, are outfitted with radio
receivers, and respond to
monitored commands, simulating
action of a "real" ship.
"The realistic aspect of the
system is the built-in delay in the
circuitry that allows action
comparable to that of a real
destroyer," states Lieutenant
Commander Christopher Clark.
There are two principle
advantages to the system: it
allows the midshipman to give
commands in the proper form to
allow efficient handling of the
ship (he masters the jargon), and
he learns the delays, pitfalls, hints
and tips concerning ship handling,
made of it because of campus
disruptions. According to Clark, it
has experienced the most use this

last quarter because of the
number of people preparing for
summer cruise.
And what will happen to this
"toy" when ROTC is phased out
in June 1973?
"The unit will be returned to
Naval Supply and 'recycled', I
suppose," Clark replied.
"There's not so much pressure
when you're dealing with a
model," Clark explained. "It's
quite a different thing when
you're up on the bridge of a real
destroyer."
Although the program is
voluntary, many students in the
NROTC program take advantage
of it because it offers excellent
preparation for the Navy summer
cruise required of NROTC
students.
"We have students from all
classes in the NROTC program
participate," Clark added. "I've
been quite pleased with the
response. I'd say a little over half
use it, once a week."
The system, which costs
around $6000.00 is financed
entirely by the Navy.
"We put in an order to Naval
Supply, and they sent us the
equipment," said Clark. "It's
standard Navy aid; they have
many on the shelf which they
issue on request. It's expensive
because it is custom made, for the
Navy."

voluntary, many students in the
NROTC program take advantage
of it because it offers excellent
preparation for the Navy summer
cruise required of NROTC
students.
"We have students from all
classes in the NROTC program
participate," Clark added. "I've
been quite pleased with the
response. I'd say a little over half
use it, once a week."
The system, which costs
around $6000.00 is financed
entirely by the Navy.
"We put in an order to Naval
Supply, and they sent us the
equipment," said Clark. "It's
standard Navy aid; they have
many on the shelf which they
issue on request. It's expensive
because it is custom made, for the
Navy."
