# Aguilar Case Closed; Other Trials Continue
## 
### ANDY ISRAEL THERESA RAMIREZ 
As the quarter draws to a close so
does Dr. Jose Aguilar's association with
the Stanford Medical School. All
Medical School committees concerned
with the issue have upheld the original
decision not to grant tenure to the
Chicano Neurosurgeon.
Bertha Gonzalez, medical student
and strong supporter of Dr. Aguilar
commented that "Dr. Hanberry's
decision is the decision." Dr. Hanberry
is Dr. Aguilar's division chief. She
added that "all the committees along
the way have agreed with Dr.
Hanberry's decision."
Although a group of Chicano
students representing the Medical
School student body and faculty
Chicano population have met with
President Lyman, Miss Gonzalez noted
that thus far there has been a refusal to
have an "unbiased committee " look
into the matter. Her definition of such
a committee is one on which the Dean
of the Medical School, the head of
Surgery, or the chief of Neurosurgery
do not sit.
Other cases stemming from events of
this and last quarter still have not been
resolved. An assault case against
Venceremos College director, Aaron
Manganiello, is going to jury tomorrow.
Manganicllo is currently being tried
on two counts of felonious assault and
battery against both officers Wayne
Warwick of the Stanford Police
Department, and John Barr of the
Stanford Fire Department. The alleged
assault on the two officers occurred on
January 28, at the first session of the
SJC's hearing on the Lodge disruption
of January 1 3.
Cases stemming from the Hospital
sit-in of April 9 are still in the pre-trial
hearing stages. The 18 arrested when
the Palo Alto police broke up the sit-in
April 1 0 have been arraigned and have
entered pleas of not guilty.
Six of the 18, including BSU
chairman Willie Newberry, were
charged with felonious assault on an
officer. Pre-trial motions will be heard
in Palo Alto Municipal Court by Judge
J. Barton Phelps, on June 1 , 2 and 3 for
those six.
Former BSU chairman Leo Bazile
and Black Liberation Front member

Chris Laury charged with the alleged
beating of Hospital worker Mary Jane
Schmidt, will be in court in Redwood
City on June 18, for a preliminary
hearing.
Bazile also pleaded not guilty in Palo
Alto on May 10 to two misdemeanor
charges stemming from the Hospital
sit-in.
The case of Sam Bridges and Chris
Laury arrested May 16 in Santa Rosa
by the Highway Patrol for possession of
Marijuana has been continued until
June 1.
