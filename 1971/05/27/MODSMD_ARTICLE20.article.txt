# Swedish Life Is A Rough Change For Deserters And Draft Evaders
## 
### LANG ATWOOD Special to the Stanford Daily 
UMEA, Sweden As the Vietnam War
winds down, fewer and fewer young
men have to face the decision of
whether to fight there or not, but this
is of little comfort to the 45 0 Gls and
draft resisters in Sweden today. Like
pawns in a chess game they have been
trapped and all but forgotten; unable to
return home they must face the
difficult adjustment to Swedish life.
Some are Gls who deserted from
their army units in Germany before
they could be sent to Vietnam, others
are draft resisters who fled here to
escape induction. They are all young,
between 18-25, and unlike other
immigrants they have no trade or
family to help ease the transition.
Sweden has been a somewhat
reluctant host, caught between a desire
to help and internal and external
political pressures. Since 1969 , a total
of 624 deserters and resisters have been
formally admitted, and they are still
coming at a rate of one or two a week.
Only 35 have been refused entry or
deported after their arrival.
Some of the political refugees
couldn't adjust for one reason or
another despite the help of Swedish
authorities. To date, 101 have
voluntarily returned to the U.S. even
though it usually meant facing a stiff
prison term, especially for the
deserters.
When an American war resister gets
into trouble, it makes headlines in both
the Swedish and American press, but in
fact, the majority of the 450 men
remaining here have begun to lead a
"normal" life again. This has been
possible because of the help offered by
the Swedes and the work of the
American Deserters Committee (ADC).
Free Housing
A newly arrived resister is given
temporary housing free of charge by
the government housing agency and
$18 a week to live on. He is also
encouraged to take free Swedish lessons
so that he can merge into Swedish life.
The ADC provides special counciling
and services and a place for the new
arrival to meet other people.
For many, this help is sufficient.
About 60 percent of the resisters now
have regular jobs. Another 25 percent
are studying in universities or trade
schools, while the rest are learning
Swedish, idle or sitting in jail.
The majority of the Americans live
in Sweden's three large cities:
Stockholm, Malmo and Gothenberg.
Many become involved in anti-war
activities but for some living in the big
cities only makes the adjustment
harder. The cost-of-living his high, and
the young Americans often find it
difficult to make ends meet on the
small stipend they receive from the
government.
It is next to impossible to get a

decent job if you can't speak Swedish,
and it takes at least six months to
attain reasonable fluency. During that
time some men wash dishes in
restaurants or take up other odd jobs to
supplement their income. For others,
dealing dope is the fastest way to make
money despite the risk of being caught
and put in jail or deported.
Robert Argento, a deserter who
works at the ADC center, estimates
that only 10 percent of the resisters
have gotten involved in Sweden's drug
problem. This small number, however,
has given the resisters a bad image in
the press and made it harder for them
to merge quietly into Swedish society.
The Swedish government is aware
that more could be done for the
deserters, but is fearful that if they
were given any special treatment it
would cause internal problems. Kristina
Nystrom, a social worker, explained
that the resisters get the same social
services as any new immigrant or
unemployed person—no more, no less.
To give them more money would raise
stronger opposition than we now have,
she explained.
Desertion—A Big Step
"Desertion, that's taking a big step,
often taken in desperation. They strike
out without thinking of the
consequences, for example, they can
never go home," said Nystrom.
"If you look beneath the surface
they are really young boys. They are
young and lost, more naive than
Swedes of their age, and at the same
time more isolated than other
immigrants who often come with a
trade and family," she continued.
The resisters feel that they need
more help in getting employment and

better language courses from the
government. While the Americans
blame the government for some of their
problems, some of the Swedish press
blame the deserters for raising the
crime rate and the level of drug
addiction. The recent case involving a
25-year old deserter who killed the
three-year old child of his German
girlfriend has not helped the public
image of the American war resister in
Sweden.
Future Uncertain
Nevertheless, it is the future which
concerns the stranded Americans most.
Almost all of them are without firm
plans, they talk vaguely of getting
married, better jobs and perhaps
returning to the U.S. if amnesty were
offered. So far, only one of them has
married.
"They spend all of their time, all of
their energy planning exactly how
they're going to escape the army and
Vietnam," says Desmond Carragher, a
draft resister himself. "They never
think through what is going to happen
afterwards."
Carragher is critical of the help he
has received. After eight weeks of
Swedish lessons they tell us, "OK boys,
go out and work," he explained.
"The only kind of work you can get
after that is in some factory or washing
dishes," he complained.
With no increased help forthcoming
from the government, the burden of
adjustment apparently will continue to
fall on the refugee.
"We must get them together with
Swedes and other foreigners that are
here, otherwise we will soon have a
ghetto," concludes Barry Winingham,
an American theology student working
at ADC.
