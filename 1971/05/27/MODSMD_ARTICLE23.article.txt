# Lyman's First Year: A Frontline Defense
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
In a year when many traditional structures and values of
the University have been under unusual attack, President
Richard Lyman's commitment to a free academic
community has often brought him to the frontlines of its
defense.
While the massive revolt of last Spring never
materialized, terrorism escalated and Stanford drew
national attention as a center of campus disruption.
In addition to facing the necessary problems of changing
the administration, cutting the budget, and having to fill
several important vacant posts, Lyman has had to take a
great but foundering university and defend it against
bombs, sit-ins, assorted vandalism, a riot, and perhaps even
more ominous, increasing outside intervention.
As the year began Lyman's forthright style repeatedly
brought him headlines. Facing his first demonstration at
the freshman convocation after just 32 hours in office, he
warned that the University's "body is being fought over"
and its "soul imperiled."
Ignoring a small group which chanted "Give 'em the
Axe!" he called for "individual political participation"
rather than "institutional commitment."
The first week he began what became weekly interviews

"A University is vulnerable on the surface, but tough underneath.
It's tough, that is, as long as-and only as long as its members
think for themselves, dodge the slogans and hysteria, and pursue
the examined life as individuals. " —Richard Lyman

on KZSU, announced he would stay in office at the most
ten years, and pushed the Daily toward independence while
attacking its having published a column by Diarmuid
McGuire as "a journalistic atrocity."
First Crisis
Two weeks into the quarter Lyman's first crisis came
when a scrawled note found at the Greyhound Bus Depot
in San Francisco threatened . . the Stanford stadium will
be blasted if the (USC football) game goes on."
Taking responsibility for allowing the game to be played
on schedule, Lyman addressed the 90,000 present shortly
before game time. "No one is able to ignore such threats in
view of the events elsewhere in the country," he said. "On
the other hand, blackmail and threats must not be allowed
to paralyze a nation or an institution. If it ever becomes
established that such tactics can succeed, we shall have
magnified enormously the capacity of a malicious few to
terrorize society."
Trashing, usually a Spring sport, first occurred late in
November in the wake of increased bombing in Indochina
and a futile U.S. raid on a North Vietnamese prisoner of
war camp.
"1 hope the student body is going to get fed up enough
with this irrelevency to make clear that it shouldn't happen
again," said Lyman. "I find it very discouraging, but short
of having a couple of thousand armed guards there's no
way to prevent it."
The next night Presidential assistant John Schwartz was
ejected from a radical meeting discussing the trashing
tactic. Lyman responded to this action with a clear
statement of policy on open and closed meetings.
Financial Crisis
In December one of the major underlying problems
which has faced Stanford this year, the shortage of
finances, surfaced. A December report of the Carnegie
Commission on Higher Education revealed a financial crisis,
it called "unmatched in its impact."
Lyman, who two days earlier had announced a $4
million budget cut over four years, reacted by saying the
report failed to put Stanford's finances in accurate
perspective. "We arc more fortunate than many institutions
in having set aside funds over the past 15 years for the
rainy days which arc now upon us," he said.
It was a fairly normal Autumn quarter.
Winter quarter is normally the quiet before the storm at
Stanford. Such was not the case this year.
Two weeks into the new quarter what was quietly billed
as a speech on the United Nations by the U.S. ambassador
to the Vatican became a major scandal for the University as
Henry Cabot Lodge was forced by hecklers to cancel his
scheduled talk.
Call for Prosecution
Lyman immediately called for prosecution against those
responsible and said the administration would "make every
possible effort to identify those who took part in the
disruption and bring appropriate charges."
He also noted, "We have nothing dramatic to propose in
the way and means of preventing this. Accountability after
the fact is an important aspect in this case. When it happens
something should follow from it, besides just clicking

tongues and expressions of sympathy in the newspapers."
Within a week seven students, a library worker, and
Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin were charged with
conduct violations.
SRI Violence
Violence erupted only a few days after the Lodge
charges were announced. Demonstrators clashed with
police at the Stanford Research Institute and trashed
buildings on campus. Nine were arrested.
The next day Franklin answered the charges against him
saying, "The appropriate response to war criminals (such as
Lodge) is not heckling, but what was done to them at
Nuremberg: they should be locked up or executed."
The next week Franklin was arrested at a Los Siete rally
in Redwood City, the trial of students before the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) was cancelled due to a disruptive
overflow crowd, and Lyman announced he would press for
Franklin's suspension.
As the SJC tried to continue hearings, four of the
defendants were cited for contempt of the chair and
suspended by Lyman for the duration of the proceedings.
The purpose of the suspensions, according to Lyman, was
to expedite the case.
Concern with the student hearings began to diffuse,

however, as news of an American supported invasion of
Laos began to leak through a news embargo imposed by the
military.
Laotian Invasion
Official word of the invasion on Sunday, Feb. 7,
touched off trashing that night involving some 250 persons
and at least 100 broken windows. In addition the ROTC
building and the Free Market, home of the conservative
Free Campus Movement, were targets of attempted
firebombings.
On Monday demonstrators trapped the Board of
Trustees in a meeting in the Graduate School of Business
and later held a peaceful sit-in in the Old Union. Police
were called in to clear both the Business School and the
Old Union, but both actions were peaceful. The incidents
followed a noon rally against the war in Indochina which
drew over 700 people.
Lyman's reaction that night was, "The broad campus

"(Franklin's suspension was) an extraordinary and unprecedented
violation of the principles of academic freedom and individual
rights-- a really dangerous introduction of authoritarianism in
the University. " — Linus Pauling

consensus, that the war is profoundly wrong, gets lost from
view as we struggle to find ways of coping with those
whose frankly avowed purpose is not to end the fighting
but to 'bring the war home to America."
Tuesday night a group of 250 students voted to strike in
protest against the Laotian invasion and announced that
after a noon rally the next day they would begin a roving
attempt to shut down various University departments
probably to include the computation center.
In a noon rally that same day the BSU announced ten
charges against the administration ranging from University
support of the Willow Expressway to the support of "racist
white regimes in Africa." The BSU gave Lyman one week
to answer.
Nighttime Clash
Wednesday afternoon radicals clashed with police at an
afternoon computation center takeover and that night with
members of the Free Campus Movement. Franklin, who
had been present at the disturbances throughout the day, at
an evening rally called for "people's war on campus." Two
persons were shot, three hospitalized with injuries and eight
arrested during the nighttime clash. Four were arrested
following the three-hour afternoon sit-in at the $5 million
computer facility.
In two broadcasts on KZSU the next day Lyman urged
community members to stay away from meetings,
disruptions, and marches, asking that all "refuse to be
drawn into the frankly declared attempt to reproduce as
much of the war as possible on the Stanford campus.
"The job of ending the war is tough enough without
these ego trips masquerading as revolution," he argued. The
issue is not "this or that tactic of warfare . . . the issue is
whether we arc going to be able to continue as a place of
learning and debate . . ."
The next day Lyman summarily suspended Franklin for
his "important role" in the "tragic events" of the previous
Wednesday night, and asked for Franklin's permanent
dismissal.
Franklin, with 16 named individuals and up to 1000
"John Does," was also enjoined by a Superior Court
temporary restraining order from committing destructive or
disruptive acts on campus.
Despite his suspension. Franklin continued to teach his
class on "Literature in the 1930'5" the next week.
Anti-war protest also continued, as 1000 people
marched from campus into Palo Alto to hold a non-violent
noon rally at Fl Camino Park.
Also That Week
The week also included a book-in by blacks in Meyer
library, apparently in reaction to the lack of administration
response to BSU demands, a recommendation of
suspension of from one to four quarters for the Lodge
disruption defendants, and hearings for library worker John
Keilch, who faced a three-month suspension for his
participation in the disruption of the Lodge speech.
In a faculty senate meeting Nobel Laureate Linus

Pauling severely criticized Lyman's suspension of Franklin
as "an extraordinary and unprecedented violation of the
principles of academic freedom and individual rights-really
dangerous introduction of authoritarianism in the
University."
It was also that week that Lyman was moved enough by
his opposition to the war to write a letter to the New York
Times. In it he stated, "If the war in Southeast Asia could
be ended by the anguished cries of university presidents it
would no doubt have been over long ago . ..
"We know something, by hard experience, of what this
far away conflict is costing in terms of democratic values
and the capacity for rational discourse on the campuses of
this country. The Vietnam war has doubtless been a limited
one, for Americans if not for Vietnamese. But its duration
now threatens us in deadly fashion..
In response to this letter Lyman was attacked on the
ABC network evening news program commentary by
Howard K. Smith for lying. Refering to Lyman's letter,
Smith said, ". . . it is unjust for leaders of institutions
designed to teach truth ... to propagate untruths about it
or about us."
On the same day that Lyman was criticized nationally
for his letter in the Times, he was criticized locally for his
lack of opposition to the war. Said an open letter from the
Newman Center clergy, "You have offered no leadership in
bringing the forces of Stanford and similar institutions to
bear against industrial support of the war."
The next week passed peacefully, but signs of discontent
continued to emerge. One such sign was a meeting between
Lyman and several hundred blacks which turned into an
acrimonious debate. BSU co-chairman Willie Newberry said
the president was "blatantly negative and evasive."
'Pretty Hostile'
Lyman himself described the meeting as "pretty
hostile." He said, "I'm not sure either of us gained as much
as we may have lost from the meeting."
In the Franklin case Lyman issued a specific set of
charges, stating that, "Franklin intentionally urged and
incited students and other persons present ... to shut
down a University computer facility . . . and to engage in
conduct which threatened injury to individuals and
property." Lyman also urged that Franklin be dismissed.
The University News Service described the case as "the
most serious disciplinary actions brought against a faculty
member since the early 1900'5."
As Winter Quarter came to a close anti-war protests
continued. Stanford students and faculty in separate
actions blocked draft boards. The students got arrested; the
faculty members didn't. The Faculty Senate condemned
the Laotian invasion and the Vietnam war.

The University also pushed its case for a preliminary
injunction to bar Franklin, six suspended students, and
seven non-students from campus. Nearly 500 faculty
members signed an open letter to Lyman supporting this
action and his efforts to "run the University by rational
and objective consideration of the facts and issues without
prejudicial coercion."
Opposition to the injunction by the defendants, 55
faculty members, trustee Denis Hayes, and the United
Stanford Employees were unsuccessful, and on March 10
the injunction was granted.
The last two weeks of the quarter also included the
suspension of library worker Keilch and a harrassment
campaign aimed at the main library which resulted in
damages of up to $ 1 5,000.
Spring Quarter
Spring Quarter began quietly enough as the student
elections got underway. There were some charges of racism
in the air-against the medical school in regard to Dr. Jose
Aguilar, and against the hospital in regard to a fired
maintenance worker, Sam Bridges-but these did not seem
overly serious.
Events escalatcd rapidly, however, and a sit-in which did
not begin as such became a club-swinging riot resulting in
$100,000 damage to the hospital.
Lyman was out of town when the delicate negotiations
between the demonstrators and administrators were
abandoned and police called in. However, he did support

that decision in an academic senate meeting when he
returned. "Occupying a building is not an acceptable form
of political action within the University," he stated.
He acknowledged, however, that, "every time it is
necessary to use the police at Stanford a defeat is suffered.
The defeat is not tactical or political; it consists of a blow
to the conception of the University as a place of reason,
not force ..
The aftermath of the sit-in also included criminal
charges against 22 persons, attempts to negotiate grievances
by black hospital workers, sets of demands by black and
Chicano groups, and sporadic acts of violence such as a
firebombing at the police station and vandalism at
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Stand Fast
Reacting to the violence, Lyman stated, "Stanford will
stand fast against those who attempt to damage the
institution as well as those who believe all-out police power
is the only solution to such attacks."
But again events escalated. This time stalled negotiations
became a brief hospital strike and sporadic violence grew
into bombing of Lyman's office and the fire-bombing of
the Junipero dorm lounge.
Lunching with students in the Junipero dorm the day
after the fire Lyman labelled the blaze "atrocious," and
said, "Terrorism tends to be a tactic taken by a protest
movement that docs not have a mass following."
Losing Proposition
Elaborating later, he stated, "In the long run, terrorism
is a losing proposition, if only because it lends to rebound
and to harm its perpetrators as much as its opponents.
"A university is vulnerable on the surface, but tough
underneath. It's tough, that is, as long as—and only as long
as-its members think for themselves, dodge the slogans and
hysteria, and pursue the examined life as individuals."
After the fire, issues remained, but the political
consciousness of the students seemed to be numbed.
Energies were directed into all-night dorm patrols, not the
affinity groups sponsored by Venceremos. The hospital
strike ended after one day without gaining significant
student support.
No Useful Purpose
The BSU issued another set of demands to Lyman, but
he replied that a new response would "serve no useful
purpose" and that the "29 sets of demands containing 182
separate items that the University has received this calendar
year" has led to "confusion and uncertainty," on the part
of administrators.
An incident stemming from the hospital strike led, in
early May, to the surprise arrests of Leo Bazile, former BSU
co-chairman and Chris Laury, a member of the hospital
negotiating team.
Immediately after the arrest Lyman and numerous other
friends of Bazile, including congressman Pete McCloskey,
raised money to pay bond for him. As it turned out, the
bond was not needed.
In other spring events the BSU held a three day
convocation on racism, the board of trustees rejected three

PERSISTENT THORN- Bruce Eranklin, shown here at the
computation center just before the police swept the area,
was a frequent participant in radical activities. Lyman's
response to the most overt of these acts was to suspend him
from his professorial duties and ask for his expulsion. In
doing so, he laid the groundwork for a precedent-setting
case which could define the role of a faculty member in the
University and the limits on that role.

campaign GM proposals despite Lyman's support of two of
them and the Stanford police chief resigned over
disagreements with the administration.
Many issues remain still unsolved, but as Spring Quarter
comes to a close the nationwide campus calm seems finally
to have caught up with Stanford.
As Lyman's first year ends, he too has begun to settle
down a bit. Speaking before the Alumni Association last
Saturday he admitted, "University presidents have perhaps
tended to spend too much time responding to criticism of
what they've done (or failed to do) lately, and too little on
the more difficult task of trying to shed some light, at least,
on the clashes of values and perceptions that are so
conspicuous and at times frightening an aspect of our era."
Explaining his concept of higher education, he said,

".. . universities do not exist for the purpose of savyis >,
souls or single-mindedly remodeling the world. They exist
to help people, in the ways that education can help, to
decide whether their souls need saving and how to do it;
whether the world needs remodeling and how to do it.
'They exist to enable men and women of all ages and all
races and all economic and social conditions to examine the
mysteries of human existence, and of the physical universe
around us, and find their ways to such answers as may be
reached by mortal beings.
"Universities exist to question everything, and to
persecute nothing. They will not be saved, nor will the
society around them, by recriminations and appeals to
force from whatever source. They need all the help they
can get, in a time of great division and bitterness. They can
live and further human freedom, that I do believe . . ."
