Looking back over the first year of a University
President, sharp outlines of events inevitably blur,
and specific criticisms blend into resignation - with
hope tagging along behind.
Richard Lyman had a number of
disappointments before he was appointed
President. And now that he's taken charge of a
much-attacked and badly battered institution, a
natural and even praiseworthy action is to rush to
its aid, and to shore up its defenses. A dangerous
accompanying tendency however, is to be content
with shoring up the defenses, and not setting up
directions and goals to move toward.
Universities have been asked to change more
rapidly in the past decade than in two or three
centuries preceding it. It now seems clear that no
single definition or goal is adequate for an
institution as diverse as Stanford. More than
anything, perhaps, it needs a constant drive within
in for self-examination and reform. It has proved
itself a nationwide leader in these areas over the
past few years but there are signs that it may be
slacking off.
An essential factor in any drive for innovation
is men with the ability to see the need for reform,
the flexibility to meet that need, and the
imagination to set up new forms where they are
needed. A number of key University posts are still
vacant. This type of educator could form the core
of one of the most forward-looking institutions in
the country.
We hope Lyman can find this type of educator
when it comes time to fill these posts. We hope,
too, that he will not feel the need to constantly
oversee them once they are appointed-it would
be hard for a single man to push an institution
toward some goal while tinkering with its internal
mechanics at the same time.
A University today can no longer be content to
hold only its traditional role. Someday it will
outlive the present age of crisis- both political and
financial. It must be prepared to adjust its role to
the needs of the society around it-and it needs a
strong leader, one untramelled by the machinery
within it. Lyman has shown himself forthright in
his defense of his ideals. We hope he will be as
forthright in setting its course for the future.
