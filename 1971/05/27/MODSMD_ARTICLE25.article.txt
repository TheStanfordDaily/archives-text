# Lyman Wins Support, But More Work Remains
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
As his first year in office draws to a close Richard
Lyman admits a feeling of "frustration because you didn't
get done things you wanted to get done."
This frustration, however, must be taken in the context
of what most observers consider to have been a job well
done.
Lyman has firmly managed the University during a time
when attacks from within and without, budget cuts, a lack

of direction, and a tension
and polarization of the
community have left it
vulnerable and often
defenseless.
Decisive Style
During this time
Lyman's decisive style, his
forthright willingness to
deal with problems, and
his articulate leadership
have become central in the
maintenance of the

"Universities do not exist for the
purpose of saving souls or single
mindedly remolding the world.
They exist to help people, in the
ways that education can help. "

university's integrity.
Both friend and opponent have been made aware of
Lyman's capabilities and his defense of the liberal academic
tradition.
Although he has often appeared machinelike in his
official role, where calm efficiency hides any emotions,
there is a human side to Lyman, and he has made some
attempts, in visiting and eating at dorms, to show it.
Students Suspicious
Unfairly perhaps, many students these days are
suspicious of any part of the establishment which is busy
defending itself, even an embroiled university. Thus, until
he is able to show more of himself as a person, students will
in general remain cautious, if not outrightly hostile, in their
judgment.
Especially in the black and radical segments of the
student body Lyman, while respected as an advisary, is
regarded with deep suspicion.
General Trust
The faculty, on the other hand, has known Lyman
longer and in general trusts him more than do students.
Most faculty members give him unqualified support. Says
Colin Pittendrigh, Professor of Biology, "He's been
superb!"
Criticisms of Lyman, in general, are mild, with specific
disagreements arising occasionally over the handling of the

Franklin case and hospital sit-in, but most concern for
more long-range and positive leadership.
Stafi, especially within the administration, is happy with
Lyman. Compared with the uncertainties of the recent
past, the reliability and self-assurance of Lyman make
working conditions more secure.
Outside the University, criticism has come almost
entirely from conservatives, for whom Lyman is just too
liberal. Even in those quarters, however, Lyman's press

image as a hardliner on law
and order has provided
some popularity.
Commenting from his
position as Chancellor of
Berkeley, Roger Heynes
says, "Lyman has done a
very fine job in a very
difficult first year. I'm
impressed wth his
thorough understanding,
honesty, directness, and
courage."

One of the common
themes of those trying to evaluate Lyman's first year is that
the job of university president, especially at Stanford, is
almost impossible. Says economics Professor George Bach,
"It's murder these days ... He has a very difficult knife
edge to walk on, and it's very easy to overreact. 1 think
Dick has really shown a lot of balance."
Another common theme has been Lyman's direct and
forceful speech. Says Howard Williams, head of the
Stanford Judicial Council, "He's made a genuine effort to
communicate with several constituencies, and he's been
extremely effective in articulating his positions."
Another faculty member concludes, "He is a clever
writer, and uses the language well. He says delicately the
things that have to be said, that people have to hear."
According to his wife Jing, Lyman writes all of his own
speeches. "He strongly feels the importance of giving
thought to a subject before he speaks," she says.
Other Qualities
Other qualities which most observers ascribe to Lyman
are intelligence, foresight, diligence, and a highly critical
mind.
Critics of Lyman say that he puts people on the
defensive. One faculty member who refused to be
identified complained, "He's a political man. He seems very
competitive and firm in his ways. He causes tensions by
handling things with too firm a hand."
Pierre Noyes, a Professor at SLAC, commented, "1 am
much disturbed by the appearance of political repression
given by his first year in office. His action against Franklin
is threatening political liberty on campus."
Noyes also expressed another criticism which several of
the faculty members who wished to remain anonymous
mentioned. "1 appreciate that the administration has
problems, but I had hoped for a more positive opposition
to the war, and a more positive and affirmative action
toward ending racism in the University."
Lyman counters that he has been very busy "fire
fighting" and that he has not had the time he had hoped
for to devote to these activities. Even so, he has often
expressed his vision of a free, open academic community
challenging the problems of society.
Lyman's actions this year may best be summed up by a
former special assistant to the President, Willard Wyman.
"Stanford has come dangerously close to the rocks
recently, and Lyman is now in the process of cautiously
getting the ship out to sea before he begins steering it on
his own course."

is tough enough without
these ego trips masquerading

judgment.
Especially in the black and radical segments of the
student body Lyman, while respected as an advisary, is
regarded with deep suspicion.
General Trust
The faculty, on the other hand, has known Lyman
longer and in general trusts him more than do students.
Most faculty members give him unqualified support. Says
Colin Pittendrigh, Professor of Biology, "He's been
superb!"
Criticisms of Lyman, in general, are mild, with specific
disagreements arising occasionally over the handling of the

Franklin case and hospital sit-in, but most concern for
more long-range and positive leadership.
Stafi, especially within the administration, is happy with
Lyman. Compared with the uncertainties of the recent
past, the reliability and self-assurance of Lyman make
working conditions more secure.
Outside the University, criticism has come almost
entirely from conservatives, for whom Lyman is just too
liberal. Even in those quarters, however, Lyman's press

image as a hardliner on law
and order has provided
some popularity.
Commenting from his
position as Chancellor of
Berkeley, Roger Heynes
says, "Lyman has done a
very fine job in a very
difficult first year. I'm
impressed wth his
thorough understanding,
honesty, directness, and
courage."

One of the common
themes of those trying to evaluate Lyman's first year is that
the job of university president, especially at Stanford, is
almost impossible. Says economics Professor George Bach,
"It's murder these days ... He has a very difficult knife
edge to walk on, and it's very easy to overreact. 1 think
Dick has really shown a lot of balance."
Another common theme has been Lyman's direct and
forceful speech. Says Howard Williams, head of the
Stanford Judicial Council, "He's made a genuine effort to
communicate with several constituencies, and he's been
extremely effective in articulating his positions."
Another faculty member concludes, "He is a clever
writer, and uses the language well. He says delicately the
things that have to be said, that people have to hear."
According to his wife Jing, Lyman writes all of his own
speeches. "He strongly feels the importance of giving
thought to a subject before he speaks," she says.
Other Qualities
Other qualities which most observers ascribe to Lyman
are intelligence, foresight, diligence, and a highly critical
mind.
Critics of Lyman say that he puts people on the
defensive. One faculty member who refused to be
identified complained, "He's a political man. He seems very
competitive and firm in his ways. He causes tensions by
handling things with too firm a hand."
Pierre Noyes, a Professor at SLAC, commented, "1 am
much disturbed by the appearance of political repression
given by his first year in office. His action against Franklin
is threatening political liberty on campus."
Noyes also expressed another criticism which several of
the faculty members who wished to remain anonymous
mentioned. "1 appreciate that the administration has
problems, but I had hoped for a more positive opposition
to the war, and a more positive and affirmative action
toward ending racism in the University."
Lyman counters that he has been very busy "fire
fighting" and that he has not had the time he had hoped
for to devote to these activities. Even so, he has often
expressed his vision of a free, open academic community
challenging the problems of society.
Lyman's actions this year may best be summed up by a
former special assistant to the President, Willard Wyman.
"Stanford has come dangerously close to the rocks
recently, and Lyman is now in the process of cautiously
getting the ship out to sea before he begins steering it on
his own course."

"The job of ending the war
is tough enough without
these ego trips masquerading
as revolution


As his first year in office draws to a close Richard
Lyman admits a feeling of "frustration because you didn't
get done things you wanted to get done."
This frustration, however, must be taken in the context
of what most observers consider to have been a job well
done.
Lyman has firmly managed the University during a time
when attacks from within and without, budget cuts, a lack

of direction, and a tension
and polarization of the
community have left it
vulnerable and often
defenseless.
Decisive Style
During this time
Lyman's decisive style, his
forthright willingness to
deal with problems, and
his articulate leadership
have become central in the
maintenance of the

university's integrity.
Both friend and opponent have been made aware of
Lyman's capabilities and his defense of the liberal academic
tradition.
Although he has often appeared machinelike in his
official role, where calm efficiency hides any emotions,
there is a human side to Lyman, and he has made some
attempts, in visiting and eating at dorms, to show it.
Students Suspicious
Unfairly perhaps, many students these days are
suspicious of any part of the establishment which is busy
defending itself, even an embroiled university. Thus, until
he is able to show more of himself as a person, students will
in general remain cautious, if not outrightly hostile, in their
judgment.

edge to walk on, and it's very easy to overreact. 1 think
Dick has really shown a lot of balance."
Another common theme has been Lyman's direct and
forceful speech. Says Howard Williams, head of the
Stanford Judicial Council, "He's made a genuine effort to
communicate with several constituencies, and he's been
extremely effective in articulating his positions."
Another faculty member concludes, "He is a clever
writer, and uses the language well. He says delicately the
things that have to be said, that people have to hear."
According to his wife Jing, Lyman writes all of his own
speeches. "He strongly feels the importance of giving
thought to a subject before he speaks," she says.
Other Qualities
Other qualities which most observers ascribe to Lyman
are intelligence, foresight, diligence, and a highly critical
mind.
Critics of Lyman say that he puts people on the
defensive. One faculty member who refused to be
identified complained, "He's a political man. He seems very
competitive and firm in his ways. He causes tensions by
handling things with too firm a hand."
Pierre Noyes, a Professor at SLAC, commented, "1 am
much disturbed by the appearance of political repression
given by his first year in office. His action against Franklin
is threatening political liberty on campus."
Noyes also expressed another criticism which several of
the faculty members who wished to remain anonymous
mentioned. "1 appreciate that the administration has
problems, but I had hoped for a more positive opposition
to the war, and a more positive and affirmative action
toward ending racism in the University."
Lyman counters that he has been very busy "fire
fighting" and that he has not had the time he had hoped
for to devote to these activities. Even so, he has often
expressed his vision of a free, open academic community
challenging the problems of society.
Lyman's actions this year may best be summed up by a
former special assistant to the President, Willard Wyman.
"Stanford has come dangerously close to the rocks
recently, and Lyman is now in the process of cautiously
getting the ship out to sea before he begins steering it on
his own course."

"The job of ending the war
is tough enough without
these ego trips masquerading
as revolution
