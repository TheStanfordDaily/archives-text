# Excellent 'Hamlet' To Climax Spring Term
## 
### JANEEN OLE OLSEN 
Starting tomorrow night at
8:00 p.m. in the Nitery, an
incredible production of
Shakespeare's "Hamlet," under
the strong direction of Mary
Geldard, will be presented. It's the
Elizabethan "Hamlet," and not
some abstract facsimile.
Probably the most criticized
play ever written, "Hamlet" is
also one of the most difficult to
produce. Problems of
interpretation pervade every
decision. How do you develop the
major characters to justify
Ophelia's suicide, Polonius' abrupt
murder, Gertrude's submission,
Hamlet's madness, and so on? The
most arresting question is, can
anyone really become Hamlet?
These puzzles were ruling my
mind as I sat Tuesday night on
Elsinore's buttressing. The set
surrounding me was murky black
with stained red planks covering
the platform surfaces. The lights
were dim, and some very
unearthly sounds were infiltrating
the atmosphere setting the mood
for the play to come.
I expected the usual nervous,
apprehensive cast. After all, it was
only a not-to-be-reviewed
rehearsal, and there were three
nights yet to go until the opening.
Instead, I was given an
outstanding performance more
worthy of a review than many
productions I have seen.
Sam Blackwell is Hamlet. His
characterization is quick, concise,
and remarkably moving.
Blackwell's performance is
obviously a result of a great deal

of close and careful study.
He mentioned that an actor
must not allow himself to be
mechanically manipulated by the
power of Shakespeare, but must
compromisingly give to and with
his character. Blackwell's
powerful use of gripping silence is
just one example of the artistry he
gives his part.
Humble Polonius is
marvelously played by Larry
Friedlander. His characterization
is fresh and strong and at many
points highlights the show in the
shadows of Sam Blackwell.
Robbi Levitow portrays a very
womanly, queenly Gertrude. Her
performance at times is amazingly
moving.
Crafty Claudius is played
satisfactorily by Michael
Goldstein. Goldstein improved as

the night went on and thus
promises well for Friday's opening
night performance.
Ophelia becomes very real
through Carlisle Ellis'
characterization, and her
adolescent brother Laertes is
adequately played by Peter
Samelson.
The special effects of sound
and lighting are very good. The
play has been exceptionally
blocked out down to the precision
of the curtain call. Cutting has
been very well done to keep the
basic form of the play. The
students of the Speech and Drama
department have been working on
this production as a class now for
two quarters, and it definitely
shows. But, watch out. What I saw
was only a rehearsal. It's going to
get better.

"Hamlet" will be playing at
8:00 p.m. in the Nitery every
night from May 2 8 to June 5 . The
tickets are well worth a dollar,
and the seats are on a first come,
first serve basis. Don't miss it.

Company's lively musical "Toad
of Toad Hall." It's performances

and Saturday 2:00 p.m. at Frost
Amphitheater. Free.

Brecht's "Mother Courage"
will play June 1-4 at Toyon
courtyard, 8 :30 p.m., free.

shown tonight through May 31 at
8 :00 p.m. in Dinkelspiel.

powerful use of gripping silence is
just one example of the artistry he
gives his part.
Humble Polonius is
marvelously played by Larry
Friedlander. His characterization
is fresh and strong and at many
points highlights the show in the
shadows of Sam Blackwell.
Robbi Levitow portrays a very
womanly, queenly Gertrude. Her
performance at times is amazingly
moving.
Crafty Claudius is played
satisfactorily by Michael
Goldstein. Goldstein improved as

the night went on and thus
promises well for Friday's opening
night performance.
Ophelia becomes very real
through Carlisle Ellis'
characterization, and her
adolescent brother Laertes is
adequately played by Peter
Samelson.
The special effects of sound
and lighting are very good. The
play has been exceptionally
blocked out down to the precision
of the curtain call. Cutting has
been very well done to keep the
basic form of the play. The
students of the Speech and Drama
department have been working on
this production as a class now for
two quarters, and it definitely
shows. But, watch out. What I saw
was only a rehearsal. It's going to
get better.

"Hamlet" will be playing at
8:00 p.m. in the Nitery every
night from May 2 8 to June 5 . The
tickets are well worth a dollar,
and the seats are on a first come,
first serve basis. Don't miss it.

Memorial Day concert.
Starting tomorrow night at
8:00 p.m. in the Nitery, an
incredible production of
Shakespeare's "Hamlet," under
the strong direction of Mary
Geldard, will be presented. It's the
Elizabethan "Hamlet," and not
some abstract facsimile.
Probably the most criticized
play ever written, "Hamlet" is
also one of the most difficult to
produce. Problems of
interpretation pervade every
decision. How do you develop the
major characters to justify
Ophelia's suicide, Polonius' abrupt
murder, Gertrude's submission,
Hamlet's madness, and so on? The
most arresting question is, can
anyone really become Hamlet?
These puzzles were ruling my
mind as I sat Tuesday night on
Elsinore's buttressing. The set
surrounding me was murky black
with stained red planks covering
the platform surfaces. The lights
were dim, and some very
unearthly sounds were infiltrating
the atmosphere setting the mood
for the play to come.
I expected the usual nervous,
apprehensive cast. After all, it was
only a not-to-be-reviewed
rehearsal, and there were three
nights yet to go until the opening.
Instead, I was given an
outstanding performance more
worthy of a review than many
productions I have seen.
Sam Blackwell is Hamlet. His
characterization is quick, concise,
and remarkably moving.
Blackwell's performance is
obviously a result of a great deal

of close and careful study.
He mentioned that an actor
must not allow himself to be
mechanically manipulated by the
power of Shakespeare, but must
compromisingly give to and with
his character. Blackwell's
powerful use of gripping silence is
just one example of the artistry he
gives his part.
Humble Polonius is
marvelously played by Larry
Friedlander. His characterization
is fresh and strong and at many
