# Advisory Board Letter

Following is the text of a letter from the Advisory
Board to President Richard W. Lyman and Associate Prof.
//. Bruce Franklin, distributed earlier this month to Aca
demic Council members, concerning the timing of its
hearings.
The Advisory Board now has before it written state
ments of position by both parties addressed to the appro
priate time for commencing the hearing requested by Pro
fessor Franklin concerning charges made against him by
the President of the University. The Board has made
known to the parties its desire to begin the hearing on
May 20. 1971. Counsel for the President propose May 25
as the date for beginning the hearing and oppose post
poning the matter until fall.
The Board has given careful consideration to the
grounds for postponement advanced by Professor Frank
lin's counsel. Briefly stated, they are: (1) unavailability of
counsel, (2) lack of adequate time to prepare and (3)
conflict between the proposed date of May 20 and the
onset of deadweek and final examinations for the spring
quarter. The Board is not persuaded that the first two
grounds are not, at least in part, self-created. As to the
third, the Board notes that deadweek does not begin until
more than a week after May 20th.
The Board thus finds itself put to a painful choice. We
have believed, and continue to believe, that the interests
of the parties and of the University community are best
served by resolution of this grave matter as quickly as
reasonably possible. If we were to give dominant weight
to that consideration, we would insist that the case pro
ceed to hearing this quarter. On the other hand, we con
sider it of first importance that we have the benefit, in
making our decision in the case, of a full and accurate
record and of thorough argument of all relevant issues,
and this requires adequately prepared counsel on both
sides. Whether or not counsel for Professor Franklin could
have been prepared for a hearing in the latter part of May,
we are now informed that they are not prepared and,
indeed, cannot be present. For Professor Franklin to
secure other counsel for an immediate hearing can hardly
be satisfactory. We recognize that delay is inherently dis
advantageous to the proponent in a case here, the Uni
versity administration. On the papers before us, however,
the only prejudice to which the administration points
stems from the possible unavailability in the fall of some
witnesses. How many of these witnesses there may be and
how crucial their testimony is to the administration's case
is not stated, nor is the question addressed whether their
testimony might be preserved now for use at a later hear
ing. rhe Board therefore concludes that some postpone
ment is indicated.
The charges in this case involve alleged incidents tak
ing place on January 11th and February 10th, 1971. On
February 12th President Lyman notified Professor Frank
lin that he would propose "that you be dismissed from
your position on the Stanford faculty." Formal charges
were issued by the President to the Board on March 22nd.
During the next several weeks Professor 112 ranklin was en
gaged in securing his present counsel. When the Board's
counsel, Professor Jan Vetter, then undertook to schedule
a preliminary meeting to explore matters of timing and
procedure for the hearing, it soon became clear that the
calendars of both parties' counsel would preclude any

hearing before the latter part of May. Accordingly, Pro
fessor Vetter wrote on April 21st to Raymond Fisher and
Michael Kennedy, counsel, respectively, for the adminis
tration and for Professor Franklin, informing them of the
Hoard's desire to set May 20th as the opening date for the
hearing so as to permit the Board to conclude its role in
the case by the end of the academic quarter. On April
26th Mr. Kennedy responded, stating, in part, "also please
be advised that 1 am scheduled to be abroad from the
16th of May through the 13th of June" and concluding
that, "in light of the work to be done in advance of the
hearing and the conflicting schedules of counsel, it would
appear to us that an attempt to have the hearing in May is
essentially impossible." This was followed by a letter
from Professor Vetter dated April 30th and addressed to
Messrs. Fisher and Kennedy, which expressed surprise
over the intervention of Mr. Kennedy's previously un
annnounced travel plans, called attention to the import
ance the Board attached to completion of the hearing in
the spring and asked for formal statements of positions
from the parties as to why the hearing should not proceed
on May 20th.
As stated above, the parties have now given their views
on a hearing date, with the administration requesting a
date of May 25th and Professor Franklin seeking a post
ponement to the fall "at a time and place to be designated
by the Board as quickly as possible."
We are hereby scheduling a meeting on Wednesday,
May 26th, 1971. at 1 p.m. in the office of the Chairman
of the Advisory Board. Room 111, Stauffer 111, Stanford
University, at which the Board will consider written or
oral statements as to the date for the hearing. Invited to
be present are counsel for the administration and for Pro
fessor Franklin. Professor Franklin and a representative of
the administration may also attend, of course, if they so
desire. Although the Board realizes that it may be diffi
cult to conduct a hearing during June or July, it wishes
each party to specify dates of availability during those
months. In the event a party considers a June or July
hearing impracticable, he should state his position, with
substantiating detail. Following the meeting, the Board
will select the earliest feasible date for commencing the
hearing up to some date early in the fall quarter.
The Board notes also that two preliminary meetings
have been scheduled in this case, both of which were
cancelled when Mr. Kennedy was unable to attend. We
also note that no written reply to the charges against
Professor Franklin has been filed, although Mr. Kennedy's
letter of April 26th to Professor Vetter states that a reply
will be "submitted forthwith." I he Board hereby requests
counsel for the parties to cooperate with ''rotessor Vetter
in setting a preliminary meeting as quickly .is possible and
requests as well the prompt tiling of ,i reply on behalf of
Professor Franklin.

as the date for beginning the hearing and oppose post
poning the matter until fall.
The Board has given careful consideration to the
grounds for postponement advanced by Professor Frank
lin's counsel. Briefly stated, they are: (1) unavailability of
counsel, (2) lack of adequate time to prepare and (3)
conflict between the proposed date of May 20 and the
onset of deadweek and final examinations for the spring
quarter. The Board is not persuaded that the first two
grounds are not, at least in part, self-created. As to the
third, the Board notes that deadweek does not begin until
more than a week after May 20th.
The Board thus finds itself put to a painful choice. We
have believed, and continue to believe, that the interests
of the parties and of the University community are best
served by resolution of this grave matter as quickly as
reasonably possible. If we were to give dominant weight
to that consideration, we would insist that the case pro
ceed to hearing this quarter. On the other hand, we con
sider it of first importance that we have the benefit, in
making our decision in the case, of a full and accurate
record and of thorough argument of all relevant issues,
and this requires adequately prepared counsel on both
sides. Whether or not counsel for Professor Franklin could
have been prepared for a hearing in the latter part of May,
we are now informed that they are not prepared and,
indeed, cannot be present. For Professor Franklin to
secure other counsel for an immediate hearing can hardly
be satisfactory. We recognize that delay is inherently dis
advantageous to the proponent in a case here, the Uni
versity administration. On the papers before us, however,
the only prejudice to which the administration points
stems from the possible unavailability in the fall of some
witnesses. How many of these witnesses there may be and
how crucial their testimony is to the administration's case
is not stated, nor is the question addressed whether their
testimony might be preserved now for use at a later hear
ing. rhe Board therefore concludes that some postpone
ment is indicated.
The charges in this case involve alleged incidents tak
ing place on January 11th and February 10th, 1971. On
February 12th President Lyman notified Professor Frank
lin that he would propose "that you be dismissed from
your position on the Stanford faculty." Formal charges
were issued by the President to the Board on March 22nd.
During the next several weeks Professor 112 ranklin was en
gaged in securing his present counsel. When the Board's
counsel, Professor Jan Vetter, then undertook to schedule
a preliminary meeting to explore matters of timing and
procedure for the hearing, it soon became clear that the
calendars of both parties' counsel would preclude any

hearing before the latter part of May. Accordingly, Pro
fessor Vetter wrote on April 21st to Raymond Fisher and
Michael Kennedy, counsel, respectively, for the adminis
tration and for Professor Franklin, informing them of the
Hoard's desire to set May 20th as the opening date for the
hearing so as to permit the Board to conclude its role in
the case by the end of the academic quarter. On April
26th Mr. Kennedy responded, stating, in part, "also please
be advised that 1 am scheduled to be abroad from the
16th of May through the 13th of June" and concluding
that, "in light of the work to be done in advance of the
hearing and the conflicting schedules of counsel, it would
appear to us that an attempt to have the hearing in May is
essentially impossible." This was followed by a letter
from Professor Vetter dated April 30th and addressed to
Messrs. Fisher and Kennedy, which expressed surprise
over the intervention of Mr. Kennedy's previously un
annnounced travel plans, called attention to the import
ance the Board attached to completion of the hearing in
the spring and asked for formal statements of positions
from the parties as to why the hearing should not proceed
on May 20th.
As stated above, the parties have now given their views
on a hearing date, with the administration requesting a
date of May 25th and Professor Franklin seeking a post
ponement to the fall "at a time and place to be designated
by the Board as quickly as possible."
We are hereby scheduling a meeting on Wednesday,
May 26th, 1971. at 1 p.m. in the office of the Chairman
of the Advisory Board. Room 111, Stauffer 111, Stanford
University, at which the Board will consider written or
oral statements as to the date for the hearing. Invited to
be present are counsel for the administration and for Pro
fessor Franklin. Professor Franklin and a representative of
the administration may also attend, of course, if they so
desire. Although the Board realizes that it may be diffi
cult to conduct a hearing during June or July, it wishes
each party to specify dates of availability during those
months. In the event a party considers a June or July
hearing impracticable, he should state his position, with
substantiating detail. Following the meeting, the Board
will select the earliest feasible date for commencing the
hearing up to some date early in the fall quarter.
The Board notes also that two preliminary meetings
have been scheduled in this case, both of which were
cancelled when Mr. Kennedy was unable to attend. We
also note that no written reply to the charges against
Professor Franklin has been filed, although Mr. Kennedy's
letter of April 26th to Professor Vetter states that a reply

grounds are not, at least in part, self-created. As to the
third, the Board notes that deadweek does not begin until
more than a week after May 20th.
The Board thus finds itself put to a painful choice. We
have believed, and continue to believe, that the interests
of the parties and of the University community are best
served by resolution of this grave matter as quickly as
reasonably possible. If we were to give dominant weight
to that consideration, we would insist that the case pro
ceed to hearing this quarter. On the other hand, we con
sider it of first importance that we have the benefit, in
making our decision in the case, of a full and accurate
record and of thorough argument of all relevant issues,
and this requires adequately prepared counsel on both
sides. Whether or not counsel for Professor Franklin could
have been prepared for a hearing in the latter part of May,
we are now informed that they are not prepared and,
indeed, cannot be present. For Professor Franklin to
secure other counsel for an immediate hearing can hardly
be satisfactory. We recognize that delay is inherently dis
advantageous to the proponent in a case here, the Uni
versity administration. On the papers before us, however,
the only prejudice to which the administration points
stems from the possible unavailability in the fall of some
witnesses. How many of these witnesses there may be and
how crucial their testimony is to the administration's case
is not stated, nor is the question addressed whether their
testimony might be preserved now for use at a later hear
ing. rhe Board therefore concludes that some postpone
ment is indicated.
The charges in this case involve alleged incidents tak
ing place on January 11th and February 10th, 1971. On
February 12th President Lyman notified Professor Frank
lin that he would propose "that you be dismissed from
your position on the Stanford faculty." Formal charges
were issued by the President to the Board on March 22nd.
During the next several weeks Professor 112 ranklin was en
gaged in securing his present counsel. When the Board's
counsel, Professor Jan Vetter, then undertook to schedule
a preliminary meeting to explore matters of timing and
procedure for the hearing, it soon became clear that the
calendars of both parties' counsel would preclude any

hearing before the latter part of May. Accordingly, Pro
fessor Vetter wrote on April 21st to Raymond Fisher and
Michael Kennedy, counsel, respectively, for the adminis
tration and for Professor Franklin, informing them of the
Hoard's desire to set May 20th as the opening date for the
hearing so as to permit the Board to conclude its role in
the case by the end of the academic quarter. On April
26th Mr. Kennedy responded, stating, in part, "also please
be advised that 1 am scheduled to be abroad from the
16th of May through the 13th of June" and concluding
that, "in light of the work to be done in advance of the
hearing and the conflicting schedules of counsel, it would
appear to us that an attempt to have the hearing in May is
essentially impossible." This was followed by a letter
from Professor Vetter dated April 30th and addressed to
Messrs. Fisher and Kennedy, which expressed surprise
over the intervention of Mr. Kennedy's previously un
annnounced travel plans, called attention to the import
ance the Board attached to completion of the hearing in
the spring and asked for formal statements of positions
from the parties as to why the hearing should not proceed
on May 20th.
As stated above, the parties have now given their views
on a hearing date, with the administration requesting a
date of May 25th and Professor Franklin seeking a post
ponement to the fall "at a time and place to be designated
by the Board as quickly as possible."
We are hereby scheduling a meeting on Wednesday,
May 26th, 1971. at 1 p.m. in the office of the Chairman
of the Advisory Board. Room 111, Stauffer 111, Stanford
University, at which the Board will consider written or
oral statements as to the date for the hearing. Invited to
be present are counsel for the administration and for Pro
fessor Franklin. Professor Franklin and a representative of
the administration may also attend, of course, if they so
desire. Although the Board realizes that it may be diffi
cult to conduct a hearing during June or July, it wishes
each party to specify dates of availability during those
months. In the event a party considers a June or July
hearing impracticable, he should state his position, with
substantiating detail. Following the meeting, the Board
will select the earliest feasible date for commencing the
hearing up to some date early in the fall quarter.
The Board notes also that two preliminary meetings
have been scheduled in this case, both of which were
cancelled when Mr. Kennedy was unable to attend. We
also note that no written reply to the charges against
Professor Franklin has been filed, although Mr. Kennedy's
letter of April 26th to Professor Vetter states that a reply
will be "submitted forthwith." I he Board hereby requests
counsel for the parties to cooperate with ''rotessor Vetter
in setting a preliminary meeting as quickly .is possible and
requests as well the prompt tiling of ,i reply on behalf of
Professor Franklin.

Following is the text of a letter from the Advisory
Board to President Richard W. Lyman and Associate Prof.
//. Bruce Franklin, distributed earlier this month to Aca
demic Council members, concerning the timing of its
hearings.
The Advisory Board now has before it written state
ments of position by both parties addressed to the appro
priate time for commencing the hearing requested by Pro
fessor Franklin concerning charges made against him by

known to the parties its desire to begin the hearing on
May 20. 1971. Counsel for the President propose May 25
as the date for beginning the hearing and oppose post
poning the matter until fall.
The Board has given careful consideration to the
grounds for postponement advanced by Professor Frank
lin's counsel. Briefly stated, they are: (1) unavailability of
counsel, (2) lack of adequate time to prepare and (3)
conflict between the proposed date of May 20 and the
onset of deadweek and final examinations for the spring
quarter. The Board is not persuaded that the first two
grounds are not, at least in part, self-created. As to the
third, the Board notes that deadweek does not begin until
more than a week after May 20th.
