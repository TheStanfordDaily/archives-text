# Tresidder Exhibit Of Peruvian Art Demonstrates Inca Culture
## 
### 
The names Chavin-Huantar, Paracas, and Chancay designate just a
few of the pre-Incan cultures which are represented in the Peruvian
handicraft exhibit now showing at Tresidder Union.
The three-week-old show, one of the most complete collections of
Peruvian handicraft ever presented in the Bay Area, includes extensive
material from pre-Incan, Incan, Spanish colonial and Republican
periods.
Reflecting Peru's three geographical areas, artifacts from the Costa,
Sierra, and Selva are amply displayed.
Organized by Amelia M. de Schumacher, wife of Dr. William
Schumacher, the large presentation of ceramics, pottery, weaving,
metal work, and sculpture is sponsored by the Industrial Engineering
Department under its project Reconstruction. The project is planning
urban reconstruction in Peru's Callejon de Huaylas, one of the regions
hardest hit in last year's earthquake.
The main goal of the exhibit is to introduce the Stanford
community to the tremendous richness of Peruvian cultural
expression in the hopes of strengthening cultural ties between
American and Peruvian communities.
Because the collection is sizeable and space in Tresidder is limited,
the artifacts on display will be changed every two weeks through the
second or third week of June.

community at an I-Center reception on June 8, from 5:00 to 7:00
p.m. The Center will show Guersoni's huge graphics from June 8
through July 2.
According to the artist, "Many of my elements are used in mass
communication, but they take a new significance in my work,
becoming symbolic structures that in some instances are reminiscent
of Hindu Mandalas.
