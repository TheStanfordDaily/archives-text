## Libertarians Supplant YAF 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
