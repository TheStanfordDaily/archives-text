# Rumble On The Right
## Libertarians Supplant YAF 
### ED KOHN News Analysis 
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
Goldwater lost. And after his overwhelming defeat the
libertarians in YAF struck out in three directions: one
group diversed itself from coalition (i.e., YAF-type)
politics; a second decided to continue working with the
conservatives; and a third began to work with what was at
the time the New Left. And it is the dialogue with the Left
that caused the downfall of the YAF and the general
tremors going through the conservative, Buckley-oriented
Right.
* * *
Between 1964 and 1969, there were several interesting
developments (aside from internal politics) within YAF:
—One entire YAF chapter (at the University of Kansas)
voted to become a chapter of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
—The head of the Brooklyn (N.Y.) College chapter
became a left-wing anarchist.
—AnObjectivistwho had spied on the SDS for the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee (now the House
Internal Security Committee) became an active, committed
member of SDS.
Many right-wing libertarians were fascinated with the
growth of radicalism on the Left. But they weren't really
sure how to react to this new trend: they simply knew
something was happening and that whatever it was, it could
not be ignored.
The Indochinese War played a major role in radicalizing
libertarians. Many libertarians tried to "work within the
system" to end the war, but they found that it didn't work
very well any more, and they continued to develop and
express admiration for the activities of the radical Left.
* * *
A libertarian caucus formed within YAF, and in August,
1969, when the group met in St. Louis for its ninth
convention, 300 of the 1200 delegates were (i) members of
the official "Libertarian Caucus" and (ii) ready to revolt.
None of the 12 slated convention speakers was a
libertarian; it was apparent from the start that the
convention was controlled by the 'traditionalists' and that
it would be hostile to the Libertarian Caucus.
Some anarchists invited Karl Hess, a former Goldwater
speech-writer turned anarchist, to speak to their own
"convention" on the opening night of the YAF assembly.
About 300 persons ignored the main YAF meeting and
attended Hess' speech, but the YAF leadership apparently
did not get the message. The second day's activities
remained uniformly traditionalist.
The Libertarian Caucus withdrew and planned for the
third day of the convention, when the votes would be
taken for the national officers and for the overall platform.
Among the caucus's proposals were:
—Immediate withdrawal from Indochina;
—Condemnation of domestic statism as an evil
equivalent to that of international communism;
—Legalization of marihuana; and
—Active resistance to the draft.
Every libertarian running for office was defeated. Every
libertarian proposal was voted down. And as the final vote
— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
the commies," they rushed the draft card burner and
attempted to attack him. The convention dissolved in an
uproar, and YAF was organizationally finished.
* * *
During its active existence, YAF was a curious
organization. Writing in the Sept. 12, 1969 edition of the
Los Angeles Free Press, J.M. Cobb noted:
"The real managers of YAF are not very young. For the
most part the managers are still the same people who
founded the organization at Buckley's house eight [sic]
years ago. I've known some of these people for several
years. As I was leaving the nominating session, I greeted
one of them and asked him what he thought of all the
action (he looked disturbed). His candor as to precisely
what Young Americans for Freedom was all about, and

how the anarchists were ruining everything, surprised me.
"The National Office of YAF is playing a noble game
with the older generation of businessmen and politicians
and making it pay. If they aren't making it pay, it's only
because their capacity for plush offices, secretaries, salaries,
expense accounts and other perquisites of ownership
exceeds their fund-raising skill.
"Last year, for example, the biggest money-raiser was the
Campaign for Voluntary Prayer in the public schools,
which was bringing in over $2000 per day from the
southwestern United States alone, at one point. This
program was used to cover money-losing projects, but ones
which "the kids" dug — such as abolishing the draft. . .
"YAF is upset because these crazy kids, with their
principled opposition to the state, are going to overturn the
National Office's carefully balanced financial-ideological
system. The only way the National Office people can get
away with their programs for fund-raising and
semi-reformist free-marketism is to promote the policy of
'fusionism,' an ideological gimmick Buckley's magazine,
National Review, has exploited for years."
* * *
The libertarians who left YAF joined with other
libertarians to form two organizations: the Society for
Individual Liberty (SIL) and the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). SIL was — and in some ways, still is — the
more middle-of-the-road organization of the two. These
two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis
for most libertarian activities during recent years. The
traditionalists, on the other hand, have been strangely
inactive.
The RLA, which has chapters from Harvard to Stanford,
has had a turbulent existence. On Colombus Day, 1969,
hundreds of RLA members met under a black flag in New
York City to debate the relative merits of communism and
individualism (many RLA members were already
communalists) and whether or not to act immediately for
revolution.
A confrontation developed at the Colombus Day
meeting: led by Hess and former SDS figures from Ann
Arbor, Mich., some 50 leftist members walked out to join
other radicals on an assault on Fort Dix, near Trenton,
N.J. One of the organization's theorists, Dr. Murray
Rothbard, an advocate of stateless laissez-faire capitalism,
denounced the walkout as "adventuristic" and with the
split, the RLA lost its potential as a national organization.
Hess is now a contributing editor of Ramparts and a
self-professed anarcho-syndicalist.
SIL, however, has not splintered, and now claims over
3,000 members. It is anarcho-capitalist and retains much of
Rand's "Objectivist" philosophy; the group has adopted a
black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.
Other libertarian organizations have sprung up across the
country as well. The California Libertarian Alliance
(basically composed of ex-YAF members) has held several
"Left-Right Festivals of Liberation" in Los Angeles that
have featured Hess, Rothbard, social critic Paul Goodman,
psychologist Thomas Szasz, and former national SDS
president Carl Ogelsby. In Arizona, the Student Libertarian
Action Movement has started a center for the elderly and
has been working with — and organizing — "street people."
Other campus groups are common in Southern California,
New England, the Midwest, and in the New
York-Philadelphia region. • i :
The libertarians (in effect, right-wing anarchists), tire
attempting to make themselves a cohesive political force
without becoming organizationally centralized — something
that they have repeatedly fought. They are becoming
increasingly active, fighting to revolutionize or destroy the
present arrangement of the state and its "monopoly on
violence."
The overall effects of the libertarian movement have yet
to be accurately measured, but one thing is certain: the old
Young Americans for Freedom is gone, and the politics of
the Buckley brothers, Reagan, Wayne, et al. will never be
quite the same again.

black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.
Other libertarian organizations have sprung up across the
country as well. The California Libertarian Alliance
(basically composed of ex-YAF members) has held several
"Left-Right Festivals of Liberation" in Los Angeles that
have featured Hess, Rothbard, social critic Paul Goodman,
psychologist Thomas Szasz, and former national SDS
president Carl Ogelsby. In Arizona, the Student Libertarian
Action Movement has started a center for the elderly and
has been working with — and organizing — "street people."
Other campus groups are common in Southern California,
New England, the Midwest, and in the New
York-Philadelphia region. • i :
The libertarians (in effect, right-wing anarchists), tire
attempting to make themselves a cohesive political force
without becoming organizationally centralized — something
that they have repeatedly fought. They are becoming
increasingly active, fighting to revolutionize or destroy the
present arrangement of the state and its "monopoly on
violence."
The overall effects of the libertarian movement have yet
to be accurately measured, but one thing is certain: the old
Young Americans for Freedom is gone, and the politics of
the Buckley brothers, Reagan, Wayne, et al. will never be
quite the same again.
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
Goldwater lost. And after his overwhelming defeat the
libertarians in YAF struck out in three directions: one
group diversed itself from coalition (i.e., YAF-type)
politics; a second decided to continue working with the
conservatives; and a third began to work with what was at
the time the New Left. And it is the dialogue with the Left
that caused the downfall of the YAF and the general
tremors going through the conservative, Buckley-oriented
Right.
* * *
Between 1964 and 1969, there were several interesting
developments (aside from internal politics) within YAF:
—One entire YAF chapter (at the University of Kansas)
voted to become a chapter of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
—The head of the Brooklyn (N.Y.) College chapter
became a left-wing anarchist.
—AnObjectivistwho had spied on the SDS for the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee (now the House
Internal Security Committee) became an active, committed
member of SDS.
Many right-wing libertarians were fascinated with the
growth of radicalism on the Left. But they weren't really
sure how to react to this new trend: they simply knew
something was happening and that whatever it was, it could
not be ignored.
The Indochinese War played a major role in radicalizing
libertarians. Many libertarians tried to "work within the
system" to end the war, but they found that it didn't work
very well any more, and they continued to develop and
express admiration for the activities of the radical Left.
* * *
A libertarian caucus formed within YAF, and in August,
1969, when the group met in St. Louis for its ninth
convention, 300 of the 1200 delegates were (i) members of
the official "Libertarian Caucus" and (ii) ready to revolt.
None of the 12 slated convention speakers was a
libertarian; it was apparent from the start that the
convention was controlled by the 'traditionalists' and that
it would be hostile to the Libertarian Caucus.
Some anarchists invited Karl Hess, a former Goldwater
speech-writer turned anarchist, to speak to their own
"convention" on the opening night of the YAF assembly.
About 300 persons ignored the main YAF meeting and
attended Hess' speech, but the YAF leadership apparently
did not get the message. The second day's activities
remained uniformly traditionalist.
The Libertarian Caucus withdrew and planned for the
third day of the convention, when the votes would be
taken for the national officers and for the overall platform.
Among the caucus's proposals were:
—Immediate withdrawal from Indochina;
—Condemnation of domestic statism as an evil
equivalent to that of international communism;
—Legalization of marihuana; and
—Active resistance to the draft.
Every libertarian running for office was defeated. Every
libertarian proposal was voted down. And as the final vote
— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
the commies," they rushed the draft card burner and
attempted to attack him. The convention dissolved in an
uproar, and YAF was organizationally finished.
* * *
During its active existence, YAF was a curious
organization. Writing in the Sept. 12, 1969 edition of the
Los Angeles Free Press, J.M. Cobb noted:
"The real managers of YAF are not very young. For the
most part the managers are still the same people who
founded the organization at Buckley's house eight [sic]
years ago. I've known some of these people for several
years. As I was leaving the nominating session, I greeted
one of them and asked him what he thought of all the
action (he looked disturbed). His candor as to precisely
what Young Americans for Freedom was all about, and

how the anarchists were ruining everything, surprised me.
"The National Office of YAF is playing a noble game
with the older generation of businessmen and politicians
and making it pay. If they aren't making it pay, it's only
because their capacity for plush offices, secretaries, salaries,
expense accounts and other perquisites of ownership
exceeds their fund-raising skill.
"Last year, for example, the biggest money-raiser was the
Campaign for Voluntary Prayer in the public schools,
which was bringing in over $2000 per day from the
southwestern United States alone, at one point. This
program was used to cover money-losing projects, but ones
which "the kids" dug — such as abolishing the draft. . .
"YAF is upset because these crazy kids, with their
principled opposition to the state, are going to overturn the
National Office's carefully balanced financial-ideological
system. The only way the National Office people can get
away with their programs for fund-raising and
semi-reformist free-marketism is to promote the policy of
'fusionism,' an ideological gimmick Buckley's magazine,
National Review, has exploited for years."
* * *
The libertarians who left YAF joined with other
libertarians to form two organizations: the Society for
Individual Liberty (SIL) and the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). SIL was — and in some ways, still is — the
more middle-of-the-road organization of the two. These
two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis
for most libertarian activities during recent years. The
traditionalists, on the other hand, have been strangely
inactive.
The RLA, which has chapters from Harvard to Stanford,
has had a turbulent existence. On Colombus Day, 1969,
hundreds of RLA members met under a black flag in New
York City to debate the relative merits of communism and
individualism (many RLA members were already
communalists) and whether or not to act immediately for
revolution.
A confrontation developed at the Colombus Day
meeting: led by Hess and former SDS figures from Ann
Arbor, Mich., some 50 leftist members walked out to join
other radicals on an assault on Fort Dix, near Trenton,
N.J. One of the organization's theorists, Dr. Murray
Rothbard, an advocate of stateless laissez-faire capitalism,
denounced the walkout as "adventuristic" and with the
split, the RLA lost its potential as a national organization.
Hess is now a contributing editor of Ramparts and a
self-professed anarcho-syndicalist.
SIL, however, has not splintered, and now claims over
3,000 members. It is anarcho-capitalist and retains much of
Rand's "Objectivist" philosophy; the group has adopted a
black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.

two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis
for most libertarian activities during recent years. The
traditionalists, on the other hand, have been strangely
inactive.
The RLA, which has chapters from Harvard to Stanford,
has had a turbulent existence. On Colombus Day, 1969,
hundreds of RLA members met under a black flag in New
York City to debate the relative merits of communism and
individualism (many RLA members were already
communalists) and whether or not to act immediately for
revolution.
A confrontation developed at the Colombus Day
meeting: led by Hess and former SDS figures from Ann
Arbor, Mich., some 50 leftist members walked out to join
other radicals on an assault on Fort Dix, near Trenton,
N.J. One of the organization's theorists, Dr. Murray
Rothbard, an advocate of stateless laissez-faire capitalism,
denounced the walkout as "adventuristic" and with the
split, the RLA lost its potential as a national organization.
Hess is now a contributing editor of Ramparts and a
self-professed anarcho-syndicalist.
SIL, however, has not splintered, and now claims over
3,000 members. It is anarcho-capitalist and retains much of
Rand's "Objectivist" philosophy; the group has adopted a
black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.
Other libertarian organizations have sprung up across the
country as well. The California Libertarian Alliance
(basically composed of ex-YAF members) has held several
"Left-Right Festivals of Liberation" in Los Angeles that
have featured Hess, Rothbard, social critic Paul Goodman,
psychologist Thomas Szasz, and former national SDS
president Carl Ogelsby. In Arizona, the Student Libertarian
Action Movement has started a center for the elderly and
has been working with — and organizing — "street people."
Other campus groups are common in Southern California,
New England, the Midwest, and in the New
York-Philadelphia region. • i :
The libertarians (in effect, right-wing anarchists), tire
attempting to make themselves a cohesive political force
without becoming organizationally centralized — something
that they have repeatedly fought. They are becoming
increasingly active, fighting to revolutionize or destroy the
present arrangement of the state and its "monopoly on
violence."
The overall effects of the libertarian movement have yet
to be accurately measured, but one thing is certain: the old
Young Americans for Freedom is gone, and the politics of
the Buckley brothers, Reagan, Wayne, et al. will never be
quite the same again.
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
Goldwater lost. And after his overwhelming defeat the
libertarians in YAF struck out in three directions: one
group diversed itself from coalition (i.e., YAF-type)
politics; a second decided to continue working with the
conservatives; and a third began to work with what was at
the time the New Left. And it is the dialogue with the Left
that caused the downfall of the YAF and the general
tremors going through the conservative, Buckley-oriented
Right.
* * *
Between 1964 and 1969, there were several interesting
developments (aside from internal politics) within YAF:
—One entire YAF chapter (at the University of Kansas)
voted to become a chapter of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
—The head of the Brooklyn (N.Y.) College chapter
became a left-wing anarchist.
—AnObjectivistwho had spied on the SDS for the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee (now the House
Internal Security Committee) became an active, committed
member of SDS.
Many right-wing libertarians were fascinated with the
growth of radicalism on the Left. But they weren't really
sure how to react to this new trend: they simply knew
something was happening and that whatever it was, it could
not be ignored.
The Indochinese War played a major role in radicalizing
libertarians. Many libertarians tried to "work within the
system" to end the war, but they found that it didn't work
very well any more, and they continued to develop and
express admiration for the activities of the radical Left.
* * *
A libertarian caucus formed within YAF, and in August,
1969, when the group met in St. Louis for its ninth
convention, 300 of the 1200 delegates were (i) members of
the official "Libertarian Caucus" and (ii) ready to revolt.
None of the 12 slated convention speakers was a
libertarian; it was apparent from the start that the
convention was controlled by the 'traditionalists' and that
it would be hostile to the Libertarian Caucus.
Some anarchists invited Karl Hess, a former Goldwater
speech-writer turned anarchist, to speak to their own
"convention" on the opening night of the YAF assembly.
About 300 persons ignored the main YAF meeting and
attended Hess' speech, but the YAF leadership apparently
did not get the message. The second day's activities
remained uniformly traditionalist.
The Libertarian Caucus withdrew and planned for the
third day of the convention, when the votes would be
taken for the national officers and for the overall platform.
Among the caucus's proposals were:
—Immediate withdrawal from Indochina;
—Condemnation of domestic statism as an evil
equivalent to that of international communism;
—Legalization of marihuana; and
—Active resistance to the draft.
Every libertarian running for office was defeated. Every
libertarian proposal was voted down. And as the final vote
— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
the commies," they rushed the draft card burner and
attempted to attack him. The convention dissolved in an
uproar, and YAF was organizationally finished.
* * *
During its active existence, YAF was a curious
organization. Writing in the Sept. 12, 1969 edition of the
Los Angeles Free Press, J.M. Cobb noted:
"The real managers of YAF are not very young. For the
most part the managers are still the same people who
founded the organization at Buckley's house eight [sic]
years ago. I've known some of these people for several
years. As I was leaving the nominating session, I greeted
one of them and asked him what he thought of all the
action (he looked disturbed). His candor as to precisely
what Young Americans for Freedom was all about, and

how the anarchists were ruining everything, surprised me.
"The National Office of YAF is playing a noble game
with the older generation of businessmen and politicians
and making it pay. If they aren't making it pay, it's only
because their capacity for plush offices, secretaries, salaries,
expense accounts and other perquisites of ownership
exceeds their fund-raising skill.
"Last year, for example, the biggest money-raiser was the
Campaign for Voluntary Prayer in the public schools,
which was bringing in over $2000 per day from the
southwestern United States alone, at one point. This
program was used to cover money-losing projects, but ones
which "the kids" dug — such as abolishing the draft. . .
"YAF is upset because these crazy kids, with their
principled opposition to the state, are going to overturn the
National Office's carefully balanced financial-ideological
system. The only way the National Office people can get
away with their programs for fund-raising and
semi-reformist free-marketism is to promote the policy of
'fusionism,' an ideological gimmick Buckley's magazine,
National Review, has exploited for years."
* * *
The libertarians who left YAF joined with other
libertarians to form two organizations: the Society for
Individual Liberty (SIL) and the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). SIL was — and in some ways, still is — the
more middle-of-the-road organization of the two. These
two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis

and making it pay. If they aren't making it pay, it's only
because their capacity for plush offices, secretaries, salaries,
expense accounts and other perquisites of ownership
exceeds their fund-raising skill.
"Last year, for example, the biggest money-raiser was the
Campaign for Voluntary Prayer in the public schools,
which was bringing in over $2000 per day from the
southwestern United States alone, at one point. This
program was used to cover money-losing projects, but ones
which "the kids" dug — such as abolishing the draft. . .
"YAF is upset because these crazy kids, with their
principled opposition to the state, are going to overturn the
National Office's carefully balanced financial-ideological
system. The only way the National Office people can get
away with their programs for fund-raising and
semi-reformist free-marketism is to promote the policy of
'fusionism,' an ideological gimmick Buckley's magazine,
National Review, has exploited for years."
* * *
The libertarians who left YAF joined with other
libertarians to form two organizations: the Society for
Individual Liberty (SIL) and the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). SIL was — and in some ways, still is — the
more middle-of-the-road organization of the two. These
two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis
for most libertarian activities during recent years. The
traditionalists, on the other hand, have been strangely
inactive.
The RLA, which has chapters from Harvard to Stanford,
has had a turbulent existence. On Colombus Day, 1969,
hundreds of RLA members met under a black flag in New
York City to debate the relative merits of communism and
individualism (many RLA members were already
communalists) and whether or not to act immediately for
revolution.
A confrontation developed at the Colombus Day
meeting: led by Hess and former SDS figures from Ann
Arbor, Mich., some 50 leftist members walked out to join
other radicals on an assault on Fort Dix, near Trenton,
N.J. One of the organization's theorists, Dr. Murray
Rothbard, an advocate of stateless laissez-faire capitalism,
denounced the walkout as "adventuristic" and with the
split, the RLA lost its potential as a national organization.
Hess is now a contributing editor of Ramparts and a
self-professed anarcho-syndicalist.
SIL, however, has not splintered, and now claims over
3,000 members. It is anarcho-capitalist and retains much of
Rand's "Objectivist" philosophy; the group has adopted a
black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.
Other libertarian organizations have sprung up across the
country as well. The California Libertarian Alliance
(basically composed of ex-YAF members) has held several
"Left-Right Festivals of Liberation" in Los Angeles that
have featured Hess, Rothbard, social critic Paul Goodman,
psychologist Thomas Szasz, and former national SDS
president Carl Ogelsby. In Arizona, the Student Libertarian
Action Movement has started a center for the elderly and
has been working with — and organizing — "street people."
Other campus groups are common in Southern California,
New England, the Midwest, and in the New
York-Philadelphia region. • i :
The libertarians (in effect, right-wing anarchists), tire
attempting to make themselves a cohesive political force
without becoming organizationally centralized — something
that they have repeatedly fought. They are becoming
increasingly active, fighting to revolutionize or destroy the
present arrangement of the state and its "monopoly on
violence."
The overall effects of the libertarian movement have yet
to be accurately measured, but one thing is certain: the old
Young Americans for Freedom is gone, and the politics of
the Buckley brothers, Reagan, Wayne, et al. will never be
quite the same again.
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
Goldwater lost. And after his overwhelming defeat the
libertarians in YAF struck out in three directions: one
group diversed itself from coalition (i.e., YAF-type)
politics; a second decided to continue working with the
conservatives; and a third began to work with what was at
the time the New Left. And it is the dialogue with the Left
that caused the downfall of the YAF and the general
tremors going through the conservative, Buckley-oriented
Right.
* * *
Between 1964 and 1969, there were several interesting
developments (aside from internal politics) within YAF:
—One entire YAF chapter (at the University of Kansas)
voted to become a chapter of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
—The head of the Brooklyn (N.Y.) College chapter
became a left-wing anarchist.
—AnObjectivistwho had spied on the SDS for the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee (now the House
Internal Security Committee) became an active, committed
member of SDS.
Many right-wing libertarians were fascinated with the
growth of radicalism on the Left. But they weren't really
sure how to react to this new trend: they simply knew
something was happening and that whatever it was, it could
not be ignored.
The Indochinese War played a major role in radicalizing
libertarians. Many libertarians tried to "work within the
system" to end the war, but they found that it didn't work
very well any more, and they continued to develop and
express admiration for the activities of the radical Left.
* * *
A libertarian caucus formed within YAF, and in August,
1969, when the group met in St. Louis for its ninth
convention, 300 of the 1200 delegates were (i) members of
the official "Libertarian Caucus" and (ii) ready to revolt.
None of the 12 slated convention speakers was a
libertarian; it was apparent from the start that the
convention was controlled by the 'traditionalists' and that
it would be hostile to the Libertarian Caucus.
Some anarchists invited Karl Hess, a former Goldwater
speech-writer turned anarchist, to speak to their own
"convention" on the opening night of the YAF assembly.
About 300 persons ignored the main YAF meeting and
attended Hess' speech, but the YAF leadership apparently
did not get the message. The second day's activities
remained uniformly traditionalist.
The Libertarian Caucus withdrew and planned for the
third day of the convention, when the votes would be
taken for the national officers and for the overall platform.
Among the caucus's proposals were:
—Immediate withdrawal from Indochina;
—Condemnation of domestic statism as an evil
equivalent to that of international communism;
—Legalization of marihuana; and
—Active resistance to the draft.
Every libertarian running for office was defeated. Every
libertarian proposal was voted down. And as the final vote
— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
the commies," they rushed the draft card burner and
attempted to attack him. The convention dissolved in an
uproar, and YAF was organizationally finished.
* * *
During its active existence, YAF was a curious
organization. Writing in the Sept. 12, 1969 edition of the
Los Angeles Free Press, J.M. Cobb noted:
"The real managers of YAF are not very young. For the
most part the managers are still the same people who
founded the organization at Buckley's house eight [sic]
years ago. I've known some of these people for several
years. As I was leaving the nominating session, I greeted
one of them and asked him what he thought of all the
action (he looked disturbed). His candor as to precisely
what Young Americans for Freedom was all about, and

how the anarchists were ruining everything, surprised me.
"The National Office of YAF is playing a noble game

— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
the commies," they rushed the draft card burner and
attempted to attack him. The convention dissolved in an
uproar, and YAF was organizationally finished.
* * *
During its active existence, YAF was a curious
organization. Writing in the Sept. 12, 1969 edition of the
Los Angeles Free Press, J.M. Cobb noted:
"The real managers of YAF are not very young. For the
most part the managers are still the same people who
founded the organization at Buckley's house eight [sic]
years ago. I've known some of these people for several
years. As I was leaving the nominating session, I greeted
one of them and asked him what he thought of all the
action (he looked disturbed). His candor as to precisely
what Young Americans for Freedom was all about, and

how the anarchists were ruining everything, surprised me.
"The National Office of YAF is playing a noble game
with the older generation of businessmen and politicians
and making it pay. If they aren't making it pay, it's only
because their capacity for plush offices, secretaries, salaries,
expense accounts and other perquisites of ownership
exceeds their fund-raising skill.
"Last year, for example, the biggest money-raiser was the
Campaign for Voluntary Prayer in the public schools,
which was bringing in over $2000 per day from the
southwestern United States alone, at one point. This
program was used to cover money-losing projects, but ones
which "the kids" dug — such as abolishing the draft. . .
"YAF is upset because these crazy kids, with their
principled opposition to the state, are going to overturn the
National Office's carefully balanced financial-ideological
system. The only way the National Office people can get
away with their programs for fund-raising and
semi-reformist free-marketism is to promote the policy of
'fusionism,' an ideological gimmick Buckley's magazine,
National Review, has exploited for years."
* * *
The libertarians who left YAF joined with other
libertarians to form two organizations: the Society for
Individual Liberty (SIL) and the Radical Libertarian
Alliance (RLA). SIL was — and in some ways, still is — the
more middle-of-the-road organization of the two. These
two groups — and their offspring - have formed the basis
for most libertarian activities during recent years. The
traditionalists, on the other hand, have been strangely
inactive.
The RLA, which has chapters from Harvard to Stanford,
has had a turbulent existence. On Colombus Day, 1969,
hundreds of RLA members met under a black flag in New
York City to debate the relative merits of communism and
individualism (many RLA members were already
communalists) and whether or not to act immediately for
revolution.
A confrontation developed at the Colombus Day
meeting: led by Hess and former SDS figures from Ann
Arbor, Mich., some 50 leftist members walked out to join
other radicals on an assault on Fort Dix, near Trenton,
N.J. One of the organization's theorists, Dr. Murray
Rothbard, an advocate of stateless laissez-faire capitalism,
denounced the walkout as "adventuristic" and with the
split, the RLA lost its potential as a national organization.
Hess is now a contributing editor of Ramparts and a
self-professed anarcho-syndicalist.
SIL, however, has not splintered, and now claims over
3,000 members. It is anarcho-capitalist and retains much of
Rand's "Objectivist" philosophy; the group has adopted a
black flag with a dollar sign as its emblem. SIL has
organized draft, tax and census resistance at points all
across the country.
Other libertarian organizations have sprung up across the
country as well. The California Libertarian Alliance
(basically composed of ex-YAF members) has held several
"Left-Right Festivals of Liberation" in Los Angeles that
have featured Hess, Rothbard, social critic Paul Goodman,
psychologist Thomas Szasz, and former national SDS
president Carl Ogelsby. In Arizona, the Student Libertarian
Action Movement has started a center for the elderly and
has been working with — and organizing — "street people."
Other campus groups are common in Southern California,
New England, the Midwest, and in the New
York-Philadelphia region. • i :
The libertarians (in effect, right-wing anarchists), tire
attempting to make themselves a cohesive political force
without becoming organizationally centralized — something
that they have repeatedly fought. They are becoming
increasingly active, fighting to revolutionize or destroy the
present arrangement of the state and its "monopoly on
violence."
The overall effects of the libertarian movement have yet
to be accurately measured, but one thing is certain: the old
Young Americans for Freedom is gone, and the politics of
the Buckley brothers, Reagan, Wayne, et al. will never be
quite the same again.
Once upon a time — not so long ago, really — there
existed a conservative political group calling itself the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). It boasted of a
membership numbering more than 50,000 (a figure always
open to question), mostly on college campusses across the
country. It enjoyed special popularity in the South and in
the Midwest. Among other functions, it operated a flashy
news service and maintained a well-stocked,
highly-publicized speakers' bureau.
Last fall brought the imminent threat of bankruptcy;
membership was in a steep decline and the group had
become organizationally dormant. It has not yet
re-awakened.
The story of the Young Americans for Freedom, its
political maneuverings, and the aftermath of its dissolution,
is a long and complicated one.
The world of the Young Americans for Freedom, of
Ronald Reagan, of John Wayne, and — last but certainly
not least — that of William F. Buckley Jr., a key man in the
formation of YAF, is slowly being revolutionized by
persons calling themselves libertarians and free-market
anarchists.
Groups like YAF and other bastions of traditional
conservativism are under fire from a new breed —
composed at least in part of their former compatriots —
dedicated to the Jeffersonian concept of decentralization,
tolerance and (conomic )laissez-fairc.
Down With Authoritarianism
In addition, these new libertarians denounce the
conservative principles of authority and of a strong state,
and many condemn present-day America with at least as

much vehemence as their counterparts on the political Left.
California libertarians, for example, last year announced
support for Dr. Timothy Leary (now living in exile in
Algiers with Black Panther Eldridge Cleaver) over Ronald
Reagan for governor. The major libertarian organizations
now recognize that some aspects of U.S. foreign policy are
imperialist and believe that the U.S. should no longer
interfere with Third World liberation struggles.
In the early 1950'5, a broad coalition — including
libertarians — fused around Buckley, who had published
the controversial book, God and Man at Yale (1951). It is
this alliance — of which the Young Americans for Freedom
was a vital member — that has recently been shattered,
along with many of the dreams of the adult Right.
The rise of the libertarian movement has close ties with
the publication of Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged (1958).
Buckley could not afford to ignore the "Objectivists," as
the Randians called themselves, because of their large
numbers, and so, in 1960, at his family estate in
Connecticut (and under his firm, guiding hand), YAF at its
formation cautiously admitted the libertarian faction into
the organization.
All For Barry
Thus, as Sen. Barry M. Goldwater began his candidacy
for the Vice Presidential nomination (and, indirectly, his
run for the 1964 Presidential sweepstakes), Buckley and a
number of other Goldwater supporters had effective
control of a youth-oriented organization. Factionsof YAF,
from the straightest conservative to the most extreme
libertarian, supported Goldwater with enthusiasm — even
Ayn Rand, who later said the only other Presidential
candidate she would have supported would have been
Jefferson himself.


THE OLD GUARD—David Keene, loft, who was elected national chairman at the
196 9 YAF convention but resigned later to work for Sprio Agnew, with Chairman
Bill.
Goldwater lost. And after his overwhelming defeat the
libertarians in YAF struck out in three directions: one
group diversed itself from coalition (i.e., YAF-type)
politics; a second decided to continue working with the
conservatives; and a third began to work with what was at
the time the New Left. And it is the dialogue with the Left
that caused the downfall of the YAF and the general
tremors going through the conservative, Buckley-oriented
Right.
* * *
Between 1964 and 1969, there were several interesting
developments (aside from internal politics) within YAF:
—One entire YAF chapter (at the University of Kansas)
voted to become a chapter of the Students for a
Democratic Society.
—The head of the Brooklyn (N.Y.) College chapter
became a left-wing anarchist.
—AnObjectivistwho had spied on the SDS for the House
UnAmerican Activities Committee (now the House
Internal Security Committee) became an active, committed
member of SDS.
Many right-wing libertarians were fascinated with the
growth of radicalism on the Left. But they weren't really
sure how to react to this new trend: they simply knew
something was happening and that whatever it was, it could
not be ignored.
The Indochinese War played a major role in radicalizing
libertarians. Many libertarians tried to "work within the
system" to end the war, but they found that it didn't work
very well any more, and they continued to develop and
express admiration for the activities of the radical Left.
* * *
A libertarian caucus formed within YAF, and in August,
1969, when the group met in St. Louis for its ninth
convention, 300 of the 1200 delegates were (i) members of
the official "Libertarian Caucus" and (ii) ready to revolt.
None of the 12 slated convention speakers was a
libertarian; it was apparent from the start that the
convention was controlled by the 'traditionalists' and that
it would be hostile to the Libertarian Caucus.
Some anarchists invited Karl Hess, a former Goldwater
speech-writer turned anarchist, to speak to their own
"convention" on the opening night of the YAF assembly.
About 300 persons ignored the main YAF meeting and
attended Hess' speech, but the YAF leadership apparently
did not get the message. The second day's activities
remained uniformly traditionalist.
The Libertarian Caucus withdrew and planned for the
third day of the convention, when the votes would be
taken for the national officers and for the overall platform.
Among the caucus's proposals were:
—Immediate withdrawal from Indochina;
—Condemnation of domestic statism as an evil
equivalent to that of international communism;
—Legalization of marihuana; and
—Active resistance to the draft.
Every libertarian running for office was defeated. Every
libertarian proposal was voted down. And as the final vote
— the one dealing with the "active resistance to the draft"
plank of the Libertarian Caucus was voted down — an
anarchist stood up and burned a facimile of his draft card.
The traditionalists were so stunned that they could only
sit back and watch for a few seconds. Then, shouting "Kill
