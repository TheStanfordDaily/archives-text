# Hornsby's Hyperbole
## Taj Captures Concert Spirit 
### PROGRESS HORNSBY 
(Taj Mahal, THE REAL
THING, recorded live at the
Fillmore East, Columbia
G30619).
The death throes of Bill
Graham's Fillmore East have
proved prolific indeed, with
several of the current top
performers scrambling to get out
recordings of live concerts there
before it closes.
About a month ago, Crosby,
Stills, Nash and Young released a
live double album titled
"Four-Way Street" from a concert
there. More recently, Elton John
(ne Reginald Kenneth Dwight)
came out with a live-at-the
Fillmore record called
"11-17-70," and now Taj Mahal
has released a double album titled
"The Real Thing."
Taj is the only one of the three
to be able to capture the real
feeling of their concerts on
record: the aura of rock history,
past and future, and the drama of
famous personalities on stage
before you is largely absent from
"Four-Way Street," as is the absurd
triumph of Elton John's
buffoonery.
Mellow Music
Taj Mahal's music is mellow
and easy-listening — the kind to
relax your mind and revive your
soul — and"The Real Thing"
comes on just that way. Most of
the songs on the album are
straightforward 12-bar blues
numbers, slightly upbeat and
stretched out to get you into the
spirit and get the musicians into
their solos.
Taj's band has changed
completely since the days of
"Giant Step." In addition to a
new guitar player, bassist, and
drummer, Taj has come up with a
pianist, a conga drummer, and a
brass section consisting of — can
you dig it? — four tubas.
Taj himself sings and plays
banjo, Mississippi National
steel-bodied guitar, chromatic
harmonica, and a six-holed "Spirit
of '76" fife. The overall effect is
somewhere . between old-style
Delta blues and funky jug-band.
Repeated Riff
After opening with the
standard "Fishin Blues" (you
remember "Many fish bites if you
got good bait"), Taj moves into
something called "Ain't Gwine to
Whistle Dixie (Any Mo')," a
simple four-measure riff repeated
over and over again which served
as the 60-second introductory cut
on the "Giant Step" album.
This time the song runs over

eight minutes, sets the tone of the
whole album, and includes a solo
from virtually everybody in the
group. (Guitarist John Hall's is
especially fine.) Taj gets in some
relaxed, if out-of-tune, whistling
and bass player Bill Rich manages
to keep eight minutes of one four-bar
chord progression from getting on
your nerves.
From there the group returns
to 12-bar blues songs for most of
the rest of the album, including
such classics as "You're Gonna
Need Somebody on Your Bond"
and "Going Up to the Country
and Paint My Mailbox Blue!"
Vocal Stylist
Taj has always been more a
vocal stylist than a singer, and on
a song called "Big Kneed Gal" he
spews out syncopated syllables at
lightning speed.
Side four is a 12-bar,
18-minute extravaganza called
"You Ain't No Street Walker
Mama, Honey But I Do Love the
Way You Strut Your Stuff,"
which contains the low point of

the album — a five-minute
dimineundo in which Taj seems
to have neither more nor less on
his mind than is on the mind of a
terrier watching a rathole.
My feeling about live
recordings is that, in general, they
reproduce existing songs but
rarely produce a definitive version
of anything, and hence are better
left as the province of
inspirational and virtuoso
performers such as the Cream (e.g.
"Wheels of Fire").
But Taj makes no pertension)
about "The Real Thing" being
anything other than relaxed,
good-time music, and in that
regard the album is undeniably a
success. Taj says it all in his liner
notes: "... and besides, this
album has all the time in the
world in it..."
