# French Film Engages, Entertains

### TODD McCARTHY 
Of all the films made during
my lifetime, I can think of none
that 1 would rather have made
than Eric Rohmer's "Claire's
Knee." Implicit in such a
statement is the suggestion that
my tastes, priorities, moral code
and sensibility are exceedingly
close to those of Rohmer and it
does not necessarily mean that the
film is a great one in the broadest
sense. However, I do think this is
one case where an emotional
favorite can hold its own
esthetically on even the most
strict and formal critical levels.
At the same time, "Claire's
Knee" manages to be
spontaneously intellectual,
unassumingly profound and
naturally beautiful, all in the most
extreme and perfect way. It also
satisfies the cinema's most
pressing requirements in being

engaging and entertaining as well.
Clearly, Rohmer is a deeply
committed romantic at heart,
albeit a rigidly intellectualized
one, but he is also a highly
disciplined scenarist, as his script
for "Claire's Knee" is a model of
formal structure filled with
careful plotting and subtle,
though definite, psychological
motivation.
Lazy Vacation
The fifth of Rohmer's Six
Moral Tales (The only other to
have been widely shown in the
States was "My Night at
Maud's.") "Claire's Knee" evokes
with extreme precision the
atmosphere of a lazy summer
vacation as Jerome (Jean-Claude
Brialy) comes to relax at a Swiss
lakeside resort before plunging
into the responsibilities of
marriage.
His principal companion there
is a slightly older female writer,

Aurora, whose intellectually
oriented, romantically-unresolved
relationship with Jerome where
everything is present but romantic
love.
Stunning Claire
Two half-sisters, Laura and
Claire, arrive and though Laura
learns something about life from
Jerome, it is the stunning Claire
that obsesses him. How can she be
so empty-headed and happy? How
can she go for that idiotic guy and
not even notice me? How can I
allow such a trifle of a girl to
disrupt my entire universe? Such
are the concerns of the
intellectual romantic.
Jerome ultimately decides that
the source of Claire's erotic allure
resides in her knee (just as logical
a choice as anywhere else, I
suppose) and resolves that he
cannot be satisfied until he
physically possesses that region
himself. He could, of course, just
thrust himself upon her, but that
would be graceless in a situation
where extreme delicacy is
required. A couple of Jerome's
attempts to hold her knee are
hilariously disastrous, but he
finally achieves success in a very
moving dramatic scene.
Emotionally Free
Once Jerome's sexual obsession
has been seen through to its
resolution, he is emotionally free
to terminate his vacation.
However, the story is hardly that
of Jerome the conqueror, for the
film ends in perfect symmetry,
with the characters having
developed significantly but
remaining on the same moral
plane.
The film's final shot is
extraordinary in its subtlety and
simplicity, as it shows a section of
a lakeside park, part of it in
sunshine and part in shade. Claire
and her brash boyfriend, who
represent a simple, but healthy,
heterosexual relationship—indeed,
they are the only two characters
with normal sexual lives—cross the
screen from left to right, passing

out of the sun and settling on a
bench in the shade.
Never-never Land
In terms of the intellectual
imaginations of the adult
characters and the proper viewer,
the shade represents the privileged
sanctuary of pure, carefree,
irrational love, uncomplicated by
the distinctions and moral codes
that can be placed upon u by the
mind. By the end of the film,
both Jerome and Aurora are
about to embark upon their own

respective marriages, but in both
cases these legal commitments
seem like something less than
what Claire and her boyfriend
have.
Rohmer has set his film in as
much of a never-never land as
exists in the real world, where all
outside responsibilities can be
temporarily forgotten, but the
characters carry their experiences
and sensibilities around with them
and it is impossible to shake them
off even in the most ideal
circumstances.
