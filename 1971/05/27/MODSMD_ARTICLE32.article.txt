# 1970-71 REPORT OF THE UNIVERSITY OMBUDSMAN
## 
### 
The background and functions of the office of the Uni
versity Ombudsman at Stanford were outlined in the An
nual Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21,
1970; Stanford Daily, October 23, 1970). This report sum
marizes our activities during the current academic year.
Since my term expires with the end of the present spring
quarter, this will be my last report to the Stanford com
munity.
The Ombudsman continued to operate this year on a
part-time (three days a week) basis with a full-time assist
ant-secretary. We were located on the Inner Quad, 81B. The
office was in operation starting with October 1, 1970, and
will remain open until the end of the spring quarter. Fol
lowing the summer quarter a new Ombudsman is expected
to take office for the academic year 1971-72.
Activities During 1970-71
During the period of eight months between October and
May a total of 125 persons contacted the office of the
Ombudsman. In attempting to resolve the grievances in
volved the Ombudsman had to see additional persons,
usually one more person per case. A breakdown of our
activities during this period is as follows.
1. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman: Grievances
accounted for about 62 percent of the cases that were
brought to us. The rest were requests for information and
assistance or suggestions and proposals for us to carry out.
During 1969-70, grievances accounted for 80 percent of the
cases.
2. Area of Complaint: Academic matters and student
services or activities each accounted for about 20 percent of
the complaints. Residences and dining halls; buildings and
grounds; tuition and financial aid; and matters pertaining to
University policies and procedures, each accounted for
about 10 percent of the complaints. The remaining 20 per
cent of problems related to a wide variety of areas.
The general substance of these grievances and issues were
quite similar to those detailed in our annual report for
1969-70.
3. Source of Complaints: By far the majority of persons
who came to see the Ombudsman were students (70%),
two-thirds undergraduates. About 20 percent were staff
members and the balance of about 10 percent were mem
bers of the faculty. These figures are very close to those of
1969-70.
4. Outcome: The 77 cases that involved specific griev
ances had the following outcomes: about half were re
solved; 12 were rejected; two were not resolved; 14 cases
were still pending at the time of the preparation of this
report; and the balance were referred elsewhere.
In one out of three cases that were brought to us, the
person did not wish to pursue the matter beyond our of
fice. Most of these involved requests for information. Of
the total group, about 15 percent were referred elsewhere.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
1. We issued a quarterly report summarizing our activi
ties for the fall quarter of 1970-71 (Campus Report, Feb
ruary 3, 1971; Stanford Daily, February 5, 1971). A similar
report was to be issued for the winter quarter but since
neither of our two projects described below could be com
pleted in time, this was not done. A spring quarter report is
not being issued because it would be redundant with the
present, more comprehensive, annual report.
2. To better evaluate the functions of the office of the
Ombudsman, we conducted a survey of all those who con
tacted us during the fall quarter. The results of this survey
are presented further on as part of the evaluation of this
year's activities.
3. The Ombudsman's office conducted an inquiry into
existing grievance procedures within the University. To this
end we requested 105 departments, divisions, and other
administrative units whose names appear in bold letters in
the Stanford telephone directory, to inform us of their cur
rent grievance procedures. We received 75 replies. In some
cases the procedure outlined covered several units. These
responses when added to existing University documents
pertinent to this issue constitute an adequate starting point
for evaluating current grievance procedures.
The results of this query show that at present there is a
wide range of approaches by which grievances are settled at
Stanford. Given the importance and complexity of this is
sue the Ombudsman's office has not attempted an informal
evaluation of these procedures. Instead, I will recommend
to the University administration that an appropriately rcp
resentive committee be assigned this task. Given the diversi
ty of University functions and constituencies it is unlikely
and perhaps not even desirable that a single, uniform code
be found to meet all needs. However, while allowing for a
certain measure of flexibility much may be gained by elimi
nating the present discrepancies in grievance procedures and
instituting a more consistent pattern which can then be
made known to all and hopefully optimally used.
4. The Ombudsman was invited to speak during the past
year to a number of groups about his functions within the
University and related matters. These included meetings of
Stanford alumni at Honolulu, Reno, and Tucson, I also
presented papers at a conference at the University of Roch
ester, New York, and at the annual meeting of the Ameri
can College Health Association in San Francisco, and gave
talks to other professional and student groups. We have also
had a number of contacts and some correspondence with
individuals and institutions interested in the Ombudsman.
Evaluation
In the annual report for 1969-70, I attempted to evalu
ate the office of the Ombudsman in terms of volume of
activity, success in settling grievances, and the scope and
nature of its interactions. Since these remarks by and large
would be applicable for the current year also they will not

be reiterated. What is more important, we have this year the
assessment of those who came to see us. To help evaluate
the functions of the office of the Ombudsman, we sent out
a seven-item questionnaire and covering letter to 58 of the
60 individuals who had contacted us during the fall quarter
of 1970-71. (Two had called in anonymously.) Forty-three
questionnaires were eventually returned to us. Some of
those who did not respond had left town and a few wrote
letters instead.
In response to the first question which pertained to the
helpfulness of the Ombudsman's office, 13 persons found it
"very helpful" and another 17, "helpful." Thus, in 30 cases
(70%) we seemed to have rendered some useful service. Ten
individuals (23%) were "uncertain" and three (7%) felt we
were "not helpful." In the "uncertain" category there were
a number of cases that were pending at the time and in two
out of three cases where we were seen as "not helpful" the
problem was outside of our purview. One of the three per
sons who thought us "not helpful" commented nevertheless
that, "The value of your office should no, be determined
by statistics let alone by those who came to ask your help."
He felt that students should have a place to complain even
if the complaint is not "legitimate."
Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we
had provided them with useful information, referred them
to the appropriate channels or assisted them in some other
way. (Since in many instances more than one category was
checked, these percentages exceed one hundred.)
Within the group of ten persons who were uncertain
about how useful we had been, four thought we had been
ineffective and one said we had failed to understand his
problem. Interestingly, seven persons in this group felt
nevertheless that we had been of some service by listening
to them, clarifying the problem and so on.
Two of the three persons who found us not helpful
ascribed this to the problem being outside of our purview
and the third said we were ineffective.
Irrespective of the outcome of their visit, we asked if
these persons felt it had been easy to contact the Ombuds
man: Thirty-seven (30C{) said "yes"; two were uncertain;
three had only seen my assistant; and the rest did not
answer the question. As to whether or not the Ombuds
man's assistant had been helpful, all who responded to the
question said, "yes." Would they come back or recommend
us to their friends? With the exception of a single person,
everyone responded positively.
Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons
thought the office was well known and the rest did not
answer the question.
The additional suggestions and comments that our re
spondents made confirmed the above. Their responses gen
erally ranged from glowing testimonials to faint praise. On
ly one person was disgruntled by the experience and felt
that we had merely served as a station on his way from one
set of bureacrats to another. Unfortunately, since this per
son did not identify himself we learned nothing through his
experience.
These same comments also reiterated the fact that the
Ombudsman's office is insufficiently known to the commu
nity. Many suggested ways of improving this and pointed
out the potentially much wider use that our office could be
put to.
Farting Remarks
At Stanford the position of Ombudsman is expected to
rotate yearly. Since my appointment came at the middle of
an academic year, 1 will have served in this capacity for
almost one and a half years.
As the University's first Ombudsman, my primary task
was to test the feasibility and usefulness of this office at
Stanford. I believe this task has been accomplished. There
is, of course, much I could have done and did not do and
some things I did that perhaps I should not have done or
should have done differently.
Whatever the value of my services to the community, I
learned much and have benefited greatly from the experi
ence. I feel obligated for this privilege to those who were
instrumental in my appointment and grateful to all who
placed their trust in me by bringing their problems to me.
Most everyone I dealt with has been reasonable and consi
derate. This applies to those who came to see me as well as
those whom I went to see myself.
Should the Ombudsman's office be continued? Apart
from the time and effort invested by all concerned, the
expense to the University is considerable. In fact, if compu
ted on a per grievance basis the cost would appear to be
staggering. While we cannot place price lags on justice, nor
can we disregard the fact that there are currently many
other vital areas that are begging lor funds.
I have recommended that the Ombudsman's office be
retained for at least another year. Despite the acute finan
cial needs the University faces in many areas, this recom
mendation has been accepted. Currently, a search commit
tee consisting of a student, a staff member, a member of
the faculty, and a representative of the administration is in
the .process of identifying potential candidates. Now that
the office is reasonably well established the next Ombuds
man will be in a position to make it better known and
develop il further in directions that seem appropriate to
him as well .is to the community. However, it the office is
to survive, the community must make adequate use of it
I lie days of luxury services are not with us anv more.

Should the Ombudsman's office be continued? Apart
from the time and effort invested by all concerned, the
expense to the University is considerable. In fact, if compu

staggering. While we cannot place price lags on justice, nor
can we disregard the fact that there are currently many
other vital areas that are begging lor funds.
I have recommended that the Ombudsman's office be
retained for at least another year. Despite the acute finan

the faculty, and a representative of the administration is in
the .process of identifying potential candidates. Now that

The background and functions of the office of the Uni
versity Ombudsman at Stanford were outlined in the An
nual Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21,
1970; Stanford Daily, October 23, 1970). This report sum
marizes our activities during the current academic year.
Since my term expires with the end of the present spring
quarter, this will be my last report to the Stanford com
munity.
The Ombudsman continued to operate this year on a
part-time (three days a week) basis with a full-time assist
ant-secretary. We were located on the Inner Quad, 81B. The
office was in operation starting with October 1, 1970, and
will remain open until the end of the spring quarter. Fol
lowing the summer quarter a new Ombudsman is expected
to take office for the academic year 1971-72.
Activities During 1970-71
During the period of eight months between October and
May a total of 125 persons contacted the office of the
Ombudsman. In attempting to resolve the grievances in
volved the Ombudsman had to see additional persons,
usually one more person per case. A breakdown of our
activities during this period is as follows.
1. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman: Grievances
accounted for about 62 percent of the cases that were
brought to us. The rest were requests for information and
assistance or suggestions and proposals for us to carry out.
During 1969-70, grievances accounted for 80 percent of the
cases.
2. Area of Complaint: Academic matters and student
services or activities each accounted for about 20 percent of
the complaints. Residences and dining halls; buildings and
grounds; tuition and financial aid; and matters pertaining to
University policies and procedures, each accounted for
about 10 percent of the complaints. The remaining 20 per
cent of problems related to a wide variety of areas.
The general substance of these grievances and issues were
quite similar to those detailed in our annual report for
1969-70.
3. Source of Complaints: By far the majority of persons
who came to see the Ombudsman were students (70%),
two-thirds undergraduates. About 20 percent were staff
members and the balance of about 10 percent were mem
bers of the faculty. These figures are very close to those of
1969-70.
4. Outcome: The 77 cases that involved specific griev
ances had the following outcomes: about half were re
solved; 12 were rejected; two were not resolved; 14 cases
were still pending at the time of the preparation of this
report; and the balance were referred elsewhere.
In one out of three cases that were brought to us, the
person did not wish to pursue the matter beyond our of
fice. Most of these involved requests for information. Of
the total group, about 15 percent were referred elsewhere.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
1. We issued a quarterly report summarizing our activi
ties for the fall quarter of 1970-71 (Campus Report, Feb
ruary 3, 1971; Stanford Daily, February 5, 1971). A similar
report was to be issued for the winter quarter but since
neither of our two projects described below could be com
pleted in time, this was not done. A spring quarter report is
not being issued because it would be redundant with the
present, more comprehensive, annual report.
2. To better evaluate the functions of the office of the
Ombudsman, we conducted a survey of all those who con
tacted us during the fall quarter. The results of this survey
are presented further on as part of the evaluation of this
year's activities.
3. The Ombudsman's office conducted an inquiry into
existing grievance procedures within the University. To this
end we requested 105 departments, divisions, and other
administrative units whose names appear in bold letters in
the Stanford telephone directory, to inform us of their cur
rent grievance procedures. We received 75 replies. In some
cases the procedure outlined covered several units. These
responses when added to existing University documents
pertinent to this issue constitute an adequate starting point
for evaluating current grievance procedures.
The results of this query show that at present there is a
wide range of approaches by which grievances are settled at
Stanford. Given the importance and complexity of this is
sue the Ombudsman's office has not attempted an informal
evaluation of these procedures. Instead, I will recommend
to the University administration that an appropriately rcp
resentive committee be assigned this task. Given the diversi
ty of University functions and constituencies it is unlikely
and perhaps not even desirable that a single, uniform code
be found to meet all needs. However, while allowing for a
certain measure of flexibility much may be gained by elimi
nating the present discrepancies in grievance procedures and
instituting a more consistent pattern which can then be
made known to all and hopefully optimally used.
4. The Ombudsman was invited to speak during the past
year to a number of groups about his functions within the
University and related matters. These included meetings of
Stanford alumni at Honolulu, Reno, and Tucson, I also
presented papers at a conference at the University of Roch
ester, New York, and at the annual meeting of the Ameri
can College Health Association in San Francisco, and gave
talks to other professional and student groups. We have also
had a number of contacts and some correspondence with
individuals and institutions interested in the Ombudsman.
Evaluation
In the annual report for 1969-70, I attempted to evalu
ate the office of the Ombudsman in terms of volume of
activity, success in settling grievances, and the scope and
nature of its interactions. Since these remarks by and large
would be applicable for the current year also they will not

be reiterated. What is more important, we have this year the
assessment of those who came to see us. To help evaluate
the functions of the office of the Ombudsman, we sent out
a seven-item questionnaire and covering letter to 58 of the
60 individuals who had contacted us during the fall quarter
of 1970-71. (Two had called in anonymously.) Forty-three
questionnaires were eventually returned to us. Some of
those who did not respond had left town and a few wrote
letters instead.
In response to the first question which pertained to the
helpfulness of the Ombudsman's office, 13 persons found it
"very helpful" and another 17, "helpful." Thus, in 30 cases
(70%) we seemed to have rendered some useful service. Ten
individuals (23%) were "uncertain" and three (7%) felt we
were "not helpful." In the "uncertain" category there were
a number of cases that were pending at the time and in two
out of three cases where we were seen as "not helpful" the
problem was outside of our purview. One of the three per
sons who thought us "not helpful" commented nevertheless
that, "The value of your office should no, be determined
by statistics let alone by those who came to ask your help."
He felt that students should have a place to complain even
if the complaint is not "legitimate."
Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we
had provided them with useful information, referred them
to the appropriate channels or assisted them in some other
way. (Since in many instances more than one category was
checked, these percentages exceed one hundred.)
Within the group of ten persons who were uncertain
about how useful we had been, four thought we had been
ineffective and one said we had failed to understand his
problem. Interestingly, seven persons in this group felt
nevertheless that we had been of some service by listening
to them, clarifying the problem and so on.
Two of the three persons who found us not helpful
ascribed this to the problem being outside of our purview
and the third said we were ineffective.
Irrespective of the outcome of their visit, we asked if
these persons felt it had been easy to contact the Ombuds
man: Thirty-seven (30C{) said "yes"; two were uncertain;
three had only seen my assistant; and the rest did not
answer the question. As to whether or not the Ombuds
man's assistant had been helpful, all who responded to the
question said, "yes." Would they come back or recommend
us to their friends? With the exception of a single person,
everyone responded positively.
Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons
thought the office was well known and the rest did not
answer the question.
The additional suggestions and comments that our re
spondents made confirmed the above. Their responses gen
erally ranged from glowing testimonials to faint praise. On
ly one person was disgruntled by the experience and felt
that we had merely served as a station on his way from one
set of bureacrats to another. Unfortunately, since this per
son did not identify himself we learned nothing through his
experience.
These same comments also reiterated the fact that the
Ombudsman's office is insufficiently known to the commu
nity. Many suggested ways of improving this and pointed
out the potentially much wider use that our office could be
put to.
Farting Remarks
At Stanford the position of Ombudsman is expected to
rotate yearly. Since my appointment came at the middle of
an academic year, 1 will have served in this capacity for
almost one and a half years.
As the University's first Ombudsman, my primary task
was to test the feasibility and usefulness of this office at
Stanford. I believe this task has been accomplished. There
is, of course, much I could have done and did not do and
some things I did that perhaps I should not have done or
should have done differently.
Whatever the value of my services to the community, I
learned much and have benefited greatly from the experi
ence. I feel obligated for this privilege to those who were
instrumental in my appointment and grateful to all who
placed their trust in me by bringing their problems to me.

Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons
thought the office was well known and the rest did not
answer the question.
The additional suggestions and comments that our re
spondents made confirmed the above. Their responses gen
erally ranged from glowing testimonials to faint praise. On
ly one person was disgruntled by the experience and felt
that we had merely served as a station on his way from one
set of bureacrats to another. Unfortunately, since this per
son did not identify himself we learned nothing through his
experience.
These same comments also reiterated the fact that the
Ombudsman's office is insufficiently known to the commu
nity. Many suggested ways of improving this and pointed
out the potentially much wider use that our office could be
put to.
Farting Remarks
At Stanford the position of Ombudsman is expected to
rotate yearly. Since my appointment came at the middle of
an academic year, 1 will have served in this capacity for
almost one and a half years.
As the University's first Ombudsman, my primary task
was to test the feasibility and usefulness of this office at
Stanford. I believe this task has been accomplished. There
is, of course, much I could have done and did not do and
some things I did that perhaps I should not have done or
should have done differently.
Whatever the value of my services to the community, I
learned much and have benefited greatly from the experi
ence. I feel obligated for this privilege to those who were
instrumental in my appointment and grateful to all who
placed their trust in me by bringing their problems to me.
Most everyone I dealt with has been reasonable and consi
derate. This applies to those who came to see me as well as
those whom I went to see myself.
Should the Ombudsman's office be continued? Apart
from the time and effort invested by all concerned, the
expense to the University is considerable. In fact, if compu
ted on a per grievance basis the cost would appear to be
staggering. While we cannot place price lags on justice, nor
can we disregard the fact that there are currently many
other vital areas that are begging lor funds.
I have recommended that the Ombudsman's office be
retained for at least another year. Despite the acute finan
cial needs the University faces in many areas, this recom
mendation has been accepted. Currently, a search commit
tee consisting of a student, a staff member, a member of
the faculty, and a representative of the administration is in
the .process of identifying potential candidates. Now that
the office is reasonably well established the next Ombuds
man will be in a position to make it better known and
develop il further in directions that seem appropriate to
him as well .is to the community. However, it the office is
to survive, the community must make adequate use of it

The background and functions of the office of the Uni
versity Ombudsman at Stanford were outlined in the An
nual Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21,
1970; Stanford Daily, October 23, 1970). This report sum
marizes our activities during the current academic year.
Since my term expires with the end of the present spring
quarter, this will be my last report to the Stanford com
munity.
The Ombudsman continued to operate this year on a
part-time (three days a week) basis with a full-time assist
ant-secretary. We were located on the Inner Quad, 81B. The
office was in operation starting with October 1, 1970, and
will remain open until the end of the spring quarter. Fol
lowing the summer quarter a new Ombudsman is expected
to take office for the academic year 1971-72.
Activities During 1970-71
During the period of eight months between October and
May a total of 125 persons contacted the office of the
Ombudsman. In attempting to resolve the grievances in
volved the Ombudsman had to see additional persons,
usually one more person per case. A breakdown of our
activities during this period is as follows.
1. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman: Grievances
accounted for about 62 percent of the cases that were
brought to us. The rest were requests for information and
assistance or suggestions and proposals for us to carry out.
During 1969-70, grievances accounted for 80 percent of the
cases.
2. Area of Complaint: Academic matters and student
services or activities each accounted for about 20 percent of
the complaints. Residences and dining halls; buildings and
grounds; tuition and financial aid; and matters pertaining to
University policies and procedures, each accounted for
about 10 percent of the complaints. The remaining 20 per
cent of problems related to a wide variety of areas.
The general substance of these grievances and issues were
quite similar to those detailed in our annual report for
1969-70.
3. Source of Complaints: By far the majority of persons
who came to see the Ombudsman were students (70%),
two-thirds undergraduates. About 20 percent were staff
members and the balance of about 10 percent were mem
bers of the faculty. These figures are very close to those of
1969-70.
4. Outcome: The 77 cases that involved specific griev
ances had the following outcomes: about half were re
solved; 12 were rejected; two were not resolved; 14 cases
were still pending at the time of the preparation of this
report; and the balance were referred elsewhere.
In one out of three cases that were brought to us, the
person did not wish to pursue the matter beyond our of
fice. Most of these involved requests for information. Of
the total group, about 15 percent were referred elsewhere.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
1. We issued a quarterly report summarizing our activi
ties for the fall quarter of 1970-71 (Campus Report, Feb
ruary 3, 1971; Stanford Daily, February 5, 1971). A similar
report was to be issued for the winter quarter but since
neither of our two projects described below could be com
pleted in time, this was not done. A spring quarter report is
not being issued because it would be redundant with the
present, more comprehensive, annual report.
2. To better evaluate the functions of the office of the
Ombudsman, we conducted a survey of all those who con
tacted us during the fall quarter. The results of this survey
are presented further on as part of the evaluation of this
year's activities.
3. The Ombudsman's office conducted an inquiry into
existing grievance procedures within the University. To this
end we requested 105 departments, divisions, and other
administrative units whose names appear in bold letters in
the Stanford telephone directory, to inform us of their cur
rent grievance procedures. We received 75 replies. In some
cases the procedure outlined covered several units. These
responses when added to existing University documents
pertinent to this issue constitute an adequate starting point
for evaluating current grievance procedures.
The results of this query show that at present there is a
wide range of approaches by which grievances are settled at
Stanford. Given the importance and complexity of this is
sue the Ombudsman's office has not attempted an informal
evaluation of these procedures. Instead, I will recommend
to the University administration that an appropriately rcp
resentive committee be assigned this task. Given the diversi
ty of University functions and constituencies it is unlikely
and perhaps not even desirable that a single, uniform code
be found to meet all needs. However, while allowing for a
certain measure of flexibility much may be gained by elimi
nating the present discrepancies in grievance procedures and
instituting a more consistent pattern which can then be
made known to all and hopefully optimally used.
4. The Ombudsman was invited to speak during the past
year to a number of groups about his functions within the
University and related matters. These included meetings of
Stanford alumni at Honolulu, Reno, and Tucson, I also
presented papers at a conference at the University of Roch
ester, New York, and at the annual meeting of the Ameri
can College Health Association in San Francisco, and gave
talks to other professional and student groups. We have also
had a number of contacts and some correspondence with
individuals and institutions interested in the Ombudsman.
Evaluation
In the annual report for 1969-70, I attempted to evalu
ate the office of the Ombudsman in terms of volume of
activity, success in settling grievances, and the scope and
nature of its interactions. Since these remarks by and large
would be applicable for the current year also they will not

be reiterated. What is more important, we have this year the
assessment of those who came to see us. To help evaluate
the functions of the office of the Ombudsman, we sent out
a seven-item questionnaire and covering letter to 58 of the
60 individuals who had contacted us during the fall quarter
of 1970-71. (Two had called in anonymously.) Forty-three
questionnaires were eventually returned to us. Some of
those who did not respond had left town and a few wrote
letters instead.
In response to the first question which pertained to the
helpfulness of the Ombudsman's office, 13 persons found it
"very helpful" and another 17, "helpful." Thus, in 30 cases
(70%) we seemed to have rendered some useful service. Ten
individuals (23%) were "uncertain" and three (7%) felt we
were "not helpful." In the "uncertain" category there were
a number of cases that were pending at the time and in two
out of three cases where we were seen as "not helpful" the
problem was outside of our purview. One of the three per
sons who thought us "not helpful" commented nevertheless
that, "The value of your office should no, be determined
by statistics let alone by those who came to ask your help."
He felt that students should have a place to complain even
if the complaint is not "legitimate."
Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we
had provided them with useful information, referred them
to the appropriate channels or assisted them in some other
way. (Since in many instances more than one category was
checked, these percentages exceed one hundred.)
Within the group of ten persons who were uncertain
about how useful we had been, four thought we had been
ineffective and one said we had failed to understand his
problem. Interestingly, seven persons in this group felt
nevertheless that we had been of some service by listening
to them, clarifying the problem and so on.
Two of the three persons who found us not helpful
ascribed this to the problem being outside of our purview
and the third said we were ineffective.
Irrespective of the outcome of their visit, we asked if
these persons felt it had been easy to contact the Ombuds
man: Thirty-seven (30C{) said "yes"; two were uncertain;
three had only seen my assistant; and the rest did not
answer the question. As to whether or not the Ombuds
man's assistant had been helpful, all who responded to the
question said, "yes." Would they come back or recommend
us to their friends? With the exception of a single person,
everyone responded positively.
Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons

Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we
had provided them with useful information, referred them
to the appropriate channels or assisted them in some other
way. (Since in many instances more than one category was
checked, these percentages exceed one hundred.)
Within the group of ten persons who were uncertain
about how useful we had been, four thought we had been
ineffective and one said we had failed to understand his
problem. Interestingly, seven persons in this group felt
nevertheless that we had been of some service by listening
to them, clarifying the problem and so on.
Two of the three persons who found us not helpful
ascribed this to the problem being outside of our purview
and the third said we were ineffective.
Irrespective of the outcome of their visit, we asked if
these persons felt it had been easy to contact the Ombuds
man: Thirty-seven (30C{) said "yes"; two were uncertain;
three had only seen my assistant; and the rest did not
answer the question. As to whether or not the Ombuds
man's assistant had been helpful, all who responded to the
question said, "yes." Would they come back or recommend
us to their friends? With the exception of a single person,
everyone responded positively.
Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons
thought the office was well known and the rest did not
answer the question.
The additional suggestions and comments that our re
spondents made confirmed the above. Their responses gen
erally ranged from glowing testimonials to faint praise. On
ly one person was disgruntled by the experience and felt
that we had merely served as a station on his way from one
set of bureacrats to another. Unfortunately, since this per
son did not identify himself we learned nothing through his
experience.
These same comments also reiterated the fact that the
Ombudsman's office is insufficiently known to the commu
nity. Many suggested ways of improving this and pointed
out the potentially much wider use that our office could be
put to.
Farting Remarks
At Stanford the position of Ombudsman is expected to
rotate yearly. Since my appointment came at the middle of
an academic year, 1 will have served in this capacity for
almost one and a half years.
As the University's first Ombudsman, my primary task
was to test the feasibility and usefulness of this office at
Stanford. I believe this task has been accomplished. There
is, of course, much I could have done and did not do and
some things I did that perhaps I should not have done or
should have done differently.
Whatever the value of my services to the community, I
learned much and have benefited greatly from the experi
ence. I feel obligated for this privilege to those who were
instrumental in my appointment and grateful to all who
placed their trust in me by bringing their problems to me.
Most everyone I dealt with has been reasonable and consi
derate. This applies to those who came to see me as well as
those whom I went to see myself.
Should the Ombudsman's office be continued? Apart
from the time and effort invested by all concerned, the
expense to the University is considerable. In fact, if compu
ted on a per grievance basis the cost would appear to be
staggering. While we cannot place price lags on justice, nor
can we disregard the fact that there are currently many
other vital areas that are begging lor funds.
I have recommended that the Ombudsman's office be
retained for at least another year. Despite the acute finan
cial needs the University faces in many areas, this recom
mendation has been accepted. Currently, a search commit
tee consisting of a student, a staff member, a member of
the faculty, and a representative of the administration is in
the .process of identifying potential candidates. Now that
the office is reasonably well established the next Ombuds
man will be in a position to make it better known and
develop il further in directions that seem appropriate to
him as well .is to the community. However, it the office is
to survive, the community must make adequate use of it

The background and functions of the office of the Uni
versity Ombudsman at Stanford were outlined in the An
nual Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21,
1970; Stanford Daily, October 23, 1970). This report sum
marizes our activities during the current academic year.
Since my term expires with the end of the present spring
quarter, this will be my last report to the Stanford com
munity.
The Ombudsman continued to operate this year on a
part-time (three days a week) basis with a full-time assist
ant-secretary. We were located on the Inner Quad, 81B. The
office was in operation starting with October 1, 1970, and
will remain open until the end of the spring quarter. Fol
lowing the summer quarter a new Ombudsman is expected
to take office for the academic year 1971-72.
Activities During 1970-71
During the period of eight months between October and
May a total of 125 persons contacted the office of the
Ombudsman. In attempting to resolve the grievances in
volved the Ombudsman had to see additional persons,
usually one more person per case. A breakdown of our
activities during this period is as follows.
1. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman: Grievances
accounted for about 62 percent of the cases that were
brought to us. The rest were requests for information and
assistance or suggestions and proposals for us to carry out.
During 1969-70, grievances accounted for 80 percent of the
cases.
2. Area of Complaint: Academic matters and student
services or activities each accounted for about 20 percent of
the complaints. Residences and dining halls; buildings and
grounds; tuition and financial aid; and matters pertaining to
University policies and procedures, each accounted for
about 10 percent of the complaints. The remaining 20 per
cent of problems related to a wide variety of areas.
The general substance of these grievances and issues were
quite similar to those detailed in our annual report for
1969-70.
3. Source of Complaints: By far the majority of persons
who came to see the Ombudsman were students (70%),
two-thirds undergraduates. About 20 percent were staff
members and the balance of about 10 percent were mem
bers of the faculty. These figures are very close to those of
1969-70.
4. Outcome: The 77 cases that involved specific griev
ances had the following outcomes: about half were re
solved; 12 were rejected; two were not resolved; 14 cases
were still pending at the time of the preparation of this
report; and the balance were referred elsewhere.
In one out of three cases that were brought to us, the
person did not wish to pursue the matter beyond our of
fice. Most of these involved requests for information. Of
the total group, about 15 percent were referred elsewhere.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
1. We issued a quarterly report summarizing our activi
ties for the fall quarter of 1970-71 (Campus Report, Feb
ruary 3, 1971; Stanford Daily, February 5, 1971). A similar
report was to be issued for the winter quarter but since
neither of our two projects described below could be com
pleted in time, this was not done. A spring quarter report is
not being issued because it would be redundant with the
present, more comprehensive, annual report.
2. To better evaluate the functions of the office of the
Ombudsman, we conducted a survey of all those who con
tacted us during the fall quarter. The results of this survey
are presented further on as part of the evaluation of this
year's activities.
3. The Ombudsman's office conducted an inquiry into
existing grievance procedures within the University. To this
end we requested 105 departments, divisions, and other
administrative units whose names appear in bold letters in
the Stanford telephone directory, to inform us of their cur
rent grievance procedures. We received 75 replies. In some
cases the procedure outlined covered several units. These
responses when added to existing University documents
pertinent to this issue constitute an adequate starting point
for evaluating current grievance procedures.
The results of this query show that at present there is a
wide range of approaches by which grievances are settled at
Stanford. Given the importance and complexity of this is
sue the Ombudsman's office has not attempted an informal
evaluation of these procedures. Instead, I will recommend
to the University administration that an appropriately rcp
resentive committee be assigned this task. Given the diversi
ty of University functions and constituencies it is unlikely
and perhaps not even desirable that a single, uniform code
be found to meet all needs. However, while allowing for a
certain measure of flexibility much may be gained by elimi
nating the present discrepancies in grievance procedures and
instituting a more consistent pattern which can then be
made known to all and hopefully optimally used.
4. The Ombudsman was invited to speak during the past
year to a number of groups about his functions within the
University and related matters. These included meetings of
Stanford alumni at Honolulu, Reno, and Tucson, I also
presented papers at a conference at the University of Roch
ester, New York, and at the annual meeting of the Ameri
can College Health Association in San Francisco, and gave
talks to other professional and student groups. We have also
had a number of contacts and some correspondence with
individuals and institutions interested in the Ombudsman.
Evaluation
In the annual report for 1969-70, I attempted to evalu
ate the office of the Ombudsman in terms of volume of
activity, success in settling grievances, and the scope and
nature of its interactions. Since these remarks by and large
would be applicable for the current year also they will not

be reiterated. What is more important, we have this year the
assessment of those who came to see us. To help evaluate
the functions of the office of the Ombudsman, we sent out
a seven-item questionnaire and covering letter to 58 of the
60 individuals who had contacted us during the fall quarter
of 1970-71. (Two had called in anonymously.) Forty-three
questionnaires were eventually returned to us. Some of
those who did not respond had left town and a few wrote
letters instead.
In response to the first question which pertained to the
helpfulness of the Ombudsman's office, 13 persons found it
"very helpful" and another 17, "helpful." Thus, in 30 cases
(70%) we seemed to have rendered some useful service. Ten
individuals (23%) were "uncertain" and three (7%) felt we
were "not helpful." In the "uncertain" category there were
a number of cases that were pending at the time and in two
out of three cases where we were seen as "not helpful" the
problem was outside of our purview. One of the three per
sons who thought us "not helpful" commented nevertheless
that, "The value of your office should no, be determined
by statistics let alone by those who came to ask your help."
He felt that students should have a place to complain even
if the complaint is not "legitimate."
Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we

nature of its interactions. Since these remarks by and large
would be applicable for the current year also they will not

be reiterated. What is more important, we have this year the
assessment of those who came to see us. To help evaluate
the functions of the office of the Ombudsman, we sent out
a seven-item questionnaire and covering letter to 58 of the
60 individuals who had contacted us during the fall quarter
of 1970-71. (Two had called in anonymously.) Forty-three
questionnaires were eventually returned to us. Some of
those who did not respond had left town and a few wrote
letters instead.
In response to the first question which pertained to the
helpfulness of the Ombudsman's office, 13 persons found it
"very helpful" and another 17, "helpful." Thus, in 30 cases
(70%) we seemed to have rendered some useful service. Ten
individuals (23%) were "uncertain" and three (7%) felt we
were "not helpful." In the "uncertain" category there were
a number of cases that were pending at the time and in two
out of three cases where we were seen as "not helpful" the
problem was outside of our purview. One of the three per
sons who thought us "not helpful" commented nevertheless
that, "The value of your office should no, be determined
by statistics let alone by those who came to ask your help."
He felt that students should have a place to complain even
if the complaint is not "legitimate."
Within the group of 30 persons who found us helpful
about one in four indicated that we had assisted him in
resolving his grievance, 30 percent said they obtained a bet
ter understanding of the problem, about 40 percent appre
ciated our lending a sympathetic ear, and over half felt we
had provided them with useful information, referred them
to the appropriate channels or assisted them in some other
way. (Since in many instances more than one category was
checked, these percentages exceed one hundred.)
Within the group of ten persons who were uncertain
about how useful we had been, four thought we had been
ineffective and one said we had failed to understand his
problem. Interestingly, seven persons in this group felt
nevertheless that we had been of some service by listening
to them, clarifying the problem and so on.
Two of the three persons who found us not helpful
ascribed this to the problem being outside of our purview
and the third said we were ineffective.
Irrespective of the outcome of their visit, we asked if
these persons felt it had been easy to contact the Ombuds
man: Thirty-seven (30C{) said "yes"; two were uncertain;
three had only seen my assistant; and the rest did not
answer the question. As to whether or not the Ombuds
man's assistant had been helpful, all who responded to the
question said, "yes." Would they come back or recommend
us to their friends? With the exception of a single person,
everyone responded positively.
Finally, we asked if the Ombudsman's office was suffi
ciently well known in the community. Twenty-eight (23%)
said "no"; 11 (9%) were uncertain. Only three persons
thought the office was well known and the rest did not
answer the question.
The additional suggestions and comments that our re
spondents made confirmed the above. Their responses gen
erally ranged from glowing testimonials to faint praise. On
ly one person was disgruntled by the experience and felt
that we had merely served as a station on his way from one
set of bureacrats to another. Unfortunately, since this per
son did not identify himself we learned nothing through his
experience.
These same comments also reiterated the fact that the
Ombudsman's office is insufficiently known to the commu
nity. Many suggested ways of improving this and pointed
out the potentially much wider use that our office could be
put to.
Farting Remarks
At Stanford the position of Ombudsman is expected to
rotate yearly. Since my appointment came at the middle of
an academic year, 1 will have served in this capacity for
almost one and a half years.
As the University's first Ombudsman, my primary task
was to test the feasibility and usefulness of this office at
Stanford. I believe this task has been accomplished. There
is, of course, much I could have done and did not do and
some things I did that perhaps I should not have done or
should have done differently.
Whatever the value of my services to the community, I
learned much and have benefited greatly from the experi
ence. I feel obligated for this privilege to those who were
instrumental in my appointment and grateful to all who
placed their trust in me by bringing their problems to me.
Most everyone I dealt with has been reasonable and consi
derate. This applies to those who came to see me as well as
those whom I went to see myself.
Should the Ombudsman's office be continued? Apart
from the time and effort invested by all concerned, the
expense to the University is considerable. In fact, if compu
ted on a per grievance basis the cost would appear to be
staggering. While we cannot place price lags on justice, nor
can we disregard the fact that there are currently many
other vital areas that are begging lor funds.
I have recommended that the Ombudsman's office be
retained for at least another year. Despite the acute finan
cial needs the University faces in many areas, this recom
mendation has been accepted. Currently, a search commit
tee consisting of a student, a staff member, a member of
the faculty, and a representative of the administration is in
the .process of identifying potential candidates. Now that
the office is reasonably well established the next Ombuds
man will be in a position to make it better known and
develop il further in directions that seem appropriate to
him as well .is to the community. However, it the office is
to survive, the community must make adequate use of it

The background and functions of the office of the Uni
versity Ombudsman at Stanford were outlined in the An
nual Report for 1969-70 (Campus Report, October 21,
1970; Stanford Daily, October 23, 1970). This report sum
marizes our activities during the current academic year.
Since my term expires with the end of the present spring
quarter, this will be my last report to the Stanford com
munity.
The Ombudsman continued to operate this year on a
part-time (three days a week) basis with a full-time assist
ant-secretary. We were located on the Inner Quad, 81B. The
office was in operation starting with October 1, 1970, and
will remain open until the end of the spring quarter. Fol
lowing the summer quarter a new Ombudsman is expected
to take office for the academic year 1971-72.
Activities During 1970-71
During the period of eight months between October and
May a total of 125 persons contacted the office of the
Ombudsman. In attempting to resolve the grievances in
volved the Ombudsman had to see additional persons,
usually one more person per case. A breakdown of our
activities during this period is as follows.
1. Reasons for Contacting the Ombudsman: Grievances
accounted for about 62 percent of the cases that were
brought to us. The rest were requests for information and
assistance or suggestions and proposals for us to carry out.
During 1969-70, grievances accounted for 80 percent of the
cases.
2. Area of Complaint: Academic matters and student
services or activities each accounted for about 20 percent of
the complaints. Residences and dining halls; buildings and
grounds; tuition and financial aid; and matters pertaining to
University policies and procedures, each accounted for
about 10 percent of the complaints. The remaining 20 per
cent of problems related to a wide variety of areas.
The general substance of these grievances and issues were
quite similar to those detailed in our annual report for
1969-70.
3. Source of Complaints: By far the majority of persons
who came to see the Ombudsman were students (70%),
two-thirds undergraduates. About 20 percent were staff
members and the balance of about 10 percent were mem
bers of the faculty. These figures are very close to those of
1969-70.
4. Outcome: The 77 cases that involved specific griev
ances had the following outcomes: about half were re
solved; 12 were rejected; two were not resolved; 14 cases
were still pending at the time of the preparation of this
report; and the balance were referred elsewhere.
In one out of three cases that were brought to us, the
person did not wish to pursue the matter beyond our of
fice. Most of these involved requests for information. Of
the total group, about 15 percent were referred elsewhere.
Additional Activities of the Ombudsman
1. We issued a quarterly report summarizing our activi
ties for the fall quarter of 1970-71 (Campus Report, Feb
ruary 3, 1971; Stanford Daily, February 5, 1971). A similar
report was to be issued for the winter quarter but since
neither of our two projects described below could be com
pleted in time, this was not done. A spring quarter report is
not being issued because it would be redundant with the
present, more comprehensive, annual report.
2. To better evaluate the functions of the office of the
Ombudsman, we conducted a survey of all those who con
tacted us during the fall quarter. The results of this survey
are presented further on as part of the evaluation of this
year's activities.
3. The Ombudsman's office conducted an inquiry into
existing grievance procedures within the University. To this
end we requested 105 departments, divisions, and other
administrative units whose names appear in bold letters in
the Stanford telephone directory, to inform us of their cur
rent grievance procedures. We received 75 replies. In some
cases the procedure outlined covered several units. These
responses when added to existing University documents
pertinent to this issue constitute an adequate starting point
for evaluating current grievance procedures.
The results of this query show that at present there is a
wide range of approaches by which grievances are settled at
Stanford. Given the importance and complexity of this is
sue the Ombudsman's office has not attempted an informal
evaluation of these procedures. Instead, I will recommend
to the University administration that an appropriately rcp
resentive committee be assigned this task. Given the diversi
ty of University functions and constituencies it is unlikely
and perhaps not even desirable that a single, uniform code
be found to meet all needs. However, while allowing for a
certain measure of flexibility much may be gained by elimi
nating the present discrepancies in grievance procedures and
instituting a more consistent pattern which can then be
made known to all and hopefully optimally used.
4. The Ombudsman was invited to speak during the past
year to a number of groups about his functions within the
University and related matters. These included meetings of
Stanford alumni at Honolulu, Reno, and Tucson, I also
presented papers at a conference at the University of Roch
ester, New York, and at the annual meeting of the Ameri
can College Health Association in San Francisco, and gave
talks to other professional and student groups. We have also
had a number of contacts and some correspondence with
individuals and institutions interested in the Ombudsman.
