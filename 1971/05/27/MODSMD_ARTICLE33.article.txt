# That Wonderful New Year's
## 
### FRED MANN 
Roses were everywhere:
painted on the field, emblazoned
on the referees' backs, and
carefully pinned to lapels in both
stands. NBC began the countdown
and flashed the peacock on the
screen. The day, already eight
hours old for most hardy parade
watchers, was in fact just
beginning. Irraseible Woody
Hayes, the visitors' coach,
connected his headset and began
to call plays devised by a helper
high above the field. Ralston
paced slowly back and forth,
continuing his discussions with
players and assistant coaches.
On the second play of the
game, the stadium clock refused
to move, causing a long delay.
One NBC technician screamed,
"unbelievable! They had a whole
year to fix that." The public
address announcer warned fans
that the wooden goal posts at
each end of the field, traditionally
demolished by the winning team's
supporters at the end of the game,
had been replaced this year with
steel posts, anchored in concrete.
It was thought to be a tough
break for Buckeye souvenir
hunters, some of whom h id been
counting on retrieving at least a
sliver of the uprights to prove
they had made the trip.
When the Stanford offense

took possession of the ball,
Ralston unveiled the first of his
new plays. The Ohio State defense
was thrown into a quandry when
Randy Vataha did not appear on
the lield. They had been
expecting him. Keying on him was
the major part of their defensive
plan. Vataha was busy hiding in
the dugout where the team bench
sat. His replacement, Eric Cross,
quickly took a reverse handoff
and ran 41 yards all the way to
the Ohio State 1 8 .
Stanford fans began looking at
each other. Was it possible? The
Indians scored, but it was called
back on a penalty. They scored
again, this time for real. Hearing
the score of the Notre Dame
surprise victory over Texas in the
Cotton Bowl, the Stanford
cheerleaders bellowed "Good Day
for an upset."
At the half, all attention was
turned to the band as leader
Geordie Lawry cavorted on a
tricycle in a rain slicker and
diapers. Even if the game was still
up in the air, there was no doubt
about the other entertainment—
the Stanford band had done it
again.
Tribe rooters were finally
beginning to realize that their
dreams of glory were just that
with Ohio State running at will all
over the Indian defense, when the
Buckeyes came up a few inches

short on the first play of the
fourth quarter. Stanford had
another chance. It was one of
those rare moments when one
could recognize a turning point
before the situation actually
changed.
The Stanford side knew this
was something big. The first real
smell of roses.
In 10 minutes, the stands
would be going wild with
anticipation. In 15, all the
injustices of the last three
years—USC, Purdue, UCLA and
more—would be forgotten. The
inadequate stadium lights would
be shining down on the new steel
goalposts, a beaten unbeatable
team, and thousands of happy Big
Red Rooters enveloping their
winners.
The traffic jam would begin,
but half of the crowd would not
mind. Old timers would call it
possibly the greatest Rose Bowl
ever. The sands of red and grey
pom-pons would lie scattered
unceremoniously on the benches
across the way discarded
mementos of a day Buckeye fans
would like to forget.
And the Stanford band would
play on into the night for students
and alumni alike, celebrating a
victory few had expected but-all
had enjoyed.

before the situation actually
changed.
The Stanford side knew this
was something big. The first real
smell of roses.
In 10 minutes, the stands
would be going wild with
anticipation. In 15, all the
injustices of the last three
years—USC, Purdue, UCLA and
more—would be forgotten. The
inadequate stadium lights would
be shining down on the new steel
goalposts, a beaten unbeatable
team, and thousands of happy Big
Red Rooters enveloping their
winners.
The traffic jam would begin,
but half of the crowd would not
mind. Old timers would call it
possibly the greatest Rose Bowl
ever. The sands of red and grey
pom-pons would lie scattered
unceremoniously on the benches
across the way discarded
mementos of a day Buckeye fans
would like to forget.
And the Stanford band would
play on into the night for students
and alumni alike, celebrating a
victory few had expected but-all
had enjoyed.
Roses were everywhere:
painted on the field, emblazoned
on the referees' backs, and
carefully pinned to lapels in both
stands. NBC began the countdown
and flashed the peacock on the
screen. The day, already eight
hours old for most hardy parade
watchers, was in fact just
beginning. Irraseible Woody
Hayes, the visitors' coach,
connected his headset and began
to call plays devised by a helper
high above the field. Ralston
paced slowly back and forth,
continuing his discussions with
players and assistant coaches.
On the second play of the
game, the stadium clock refused
to move, causing a long delay.
One NBC technician screamed,
"unbelievable! They had a whole
year to fix that." The public
address announcer warned fans
that the wooden goal posts at
each end of the field, traditionally
demolished by the winning team's
supporters at the end of the game,
had been replaced this year with
steel posts, anchored in concrete.
It was thought to be a tough
break for Buckeye souvenir
hunters, some of whom h id been
counting on retrieving at least a
sliver of the uprights to prove
they had made the trip.
When the Stanford offense

took possession of the ball,
Ralston unveiled the first of his
new plays. The Ohio State defense
was thrown into a quandry when
Randy Vataha did not appear on
the lield. They had been
expecting him. Keying on him was
the major part of their defensive
plan. Vataha was busy hiding in
the dugout where the team bench
sat. His replacement, Eric Cross,
quickly took a reverse handoff
and ran 41 yards all the way to
the Ohio State 1 8 .
Stanford fans began looking at
each other. Was it possible? The
Indians scored, but it was called
back on a penalty. They scored
again, this time for real. Hearing
the score of the Notre Dame
surprise victory over Texas in the
Cotton Bowl, the Stanford
cheerleaders bellowed "Good Day
for an upset."
At the half, all attention was
turned to the band as leader
Geordie Lawry cavorted on a
tricycle in a rain slicker and
diapers. Even if the game was still
up in the air, there was no doubt
about the other entertainment—
the Stanford band had done it
again.
Tribe rooters were finally
beginning to realize that their
dreams of glory were just that
with Ohio State running at will all
over the Indian defense, when the
Buckeyes came up a few inches

short on the first play of the
fourth quarter. Stanford had
another chance. It was one of
those rare moments when one
could recognize a turning point
before the situation actually
changed.
