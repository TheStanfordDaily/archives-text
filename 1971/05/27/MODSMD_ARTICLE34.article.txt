# Today's Dream, Tomorrow's Fact
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Back in August while most of
us were occupied with summer
jobs, studies and loves, one of the
more remarkable years in
Stanford's football history began.
The heartbreaks of seasons past
had been forgotten and the
proverbial next year was here.
A few weeks of drudgery and
hard work went by and
September 12 quickly arrived. A
few devoted supporters and those
insanely beautiful bandsmen were
there in the heart of Arkansas, but
most of us just took a break from
usual summer afternoon activities
and watched on TV.
It began like a dream. Delirium
rocked many a Stanford fan's
living room as the footballers
jumped out to a 27-0 lead. But
soon a deja vu began to reform.
The stupor of a seemingly
premature Budweiser celebration
wore off as Arkansas drove
towards the Stanford goal line.
Heartbreakers Aren't Repeated
It was hard to look when
Razorback quarterback Bill

Montgomery took the snap with
seconds remaining. But linebacker
Mike Simone destroyed that
oft-repeated scene when he
stopped Montgomery and ended
any chance of another last second
Stanford loss.
Luckily those heartbreakers
never really happened last year.
Of course there were those days
when Air Force and Purdue made
it look like the Indians had failed
to show up. And the Big Came
saw Cal reverse a recent pattern
when this time they salvaged
something out of an otherwise
disappointing season.
But nothing makes bad
moments easier to forget than a
lot of good ones. And last fall
they came often. There are far too
many to recount, but some can't
pass unrelived.
After Arkansas there was the
day in Eugene when they fought
back from a 3-0 Oregon halftime
shutout and showed that Arkansas
had been no' Joke. ' '*

Bomb Scare Stop Indians
Then there was the game a
bomb scare couldn't stop in which

USC had to head home without a
victory for the first time in over a
decade. Two weeks later the Cards
followed them into LA and
against UCLA changed a Coliseum
story which had been repeated
annually.
Finally back at home against
Washington, John Ralston won his
conference championship. It was
downhill from there for the rest
of 1 97 0.
But the new year began with
the biggest challenge of all.
Woody Hayes had brought his
Spartan troops into Pasadena and
some thought it would be the old
"throwing David to the lions"
scene.
The floats and friends and
parties were loads of fun, but they
were quickly forgotten as the
game began. But somehow the
Biblical script wasn't followed.
Stanford had destroyed many
other myths this year and they
weren't about to be stopped now.
Every player made one final
effort and the peak had been
reached. With help from an entire
team, Plunkett finally won the
Heisman trophy and all that
remained was the never ending
stream of parties and reunions
which would glorify these
moments forever.
Future Look Hopeful
But now another August is

near. Last year Stanford beat the
Coliseum, USC and won a Rose
Bowlâ€”can they do it again? The
choke image has been destroyed.
Now the winning tradition has to
be firmly established and the one
year fluke theory must be
overcome.
It won't be easy. From
Plunkett on down, a lot of people
are gone. Still a lot of talented
people return and they will be
joined by promising sophomores
and transfers. The potential is
there, but there are a lot of holes
to be filled.
Don Bunce will give Stanford a
strong option quarterback and he
will have a strong backfield to
work with. But an entirely new
crew of receivers and a largely
new offensive line will have hard
tests to pass.
The defense could be stronger
than ever. The backfield will be
composed almost totally of
veterans. Ail-American candidate
Jeff Siemon will lead a talented
crew of both veteran and new
linebackers. And the line will be
anchored by a number of
returning lettermen.
There will be a number of
problems, especially on offense.
Ralston feels that next year's
team will be improved, but until
the receivers and offensive
linemen face that first game, no
one can be sure. Still a trip to

Pasadena is lar trom impossible.
But there will be a lot of
potential heartbreakers along the
way. Every one of them will be
out to beat Stanford, not USC or
UCLA as previously.
Rest of League to be Tough
Sonny Sixkiller at Washington
and Dan Fouts at Oregon are just
two of the leaders of strong and
veteran Northwest teams. And
Oregon State has lost almost no
one from last year's squad.
Inside California the picture
looks even tougher. Cal has
bolstered themselves considerably
with a large number of junior
college transfers. And now in
addition to their usually awesome
talent, UCLA and USC will have
the added incentive of memories
of those days in last October.
Indians Out to Prove no Miracle
But while everyone else will be
remembering last season when
they face Stanford, the Indians
will be remembering those days
too. Last season they made a start
towards breaking down the
football dynasty so long held by
schools from Southern California.
When they face Missouri in three
and a half months, they'll be
beginning a season in which
they'll try to prove that it wasn't
just a miracle.


HE S GONE NOW The familiar number 16 won't be around next year to work those great double reverses with Jackie Brown and Eric-
Cross, but the Indians will be challenging for the title once again. John Ralston won't be lamenting too long after graduation day.
