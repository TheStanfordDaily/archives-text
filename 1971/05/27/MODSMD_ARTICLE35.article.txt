# Baseball's Future Spells Title
## 
### TOM QUINN 
The abrupt collapse of the
baseball team in the hinterlands of
the North left most Stanford
buffs sourly lamenting another
choke, but the tournament play
actually mirrored the whole
exciting season of the young
Cards in both the magnificent
heights to which they could rise
and the unexplainable blunders
that they were so capable of
perpetrating.
The Indians so often blasted an
opposing pitcher for four runs in
one inning only to blow their lead
with the same number of errors in
the next frame. The end result
would be usually a dramatic
Stanford comeback to win in the
ninth. The Cards combined the
excitement of the early Mets'
teams with a propensity to win
that New York's wonders never
approached.
No one dared to concede either
a playoff berth or a 159-20 record
to Stanford after looking at the
team on paper at the beginning of
the year. The team had only five
seniors on a roster of 2 0 players
and most of the rest were untried
freshmen and sophomores. The
pitching staff was crippled by the
loss of ace Steve Dunning who

graduated to the Cleveland
Indians.
Pitching Came Through
Yet it was the pitching that
came through and provided the
decisive wins in the games that
counted. Dan Shaw, an unproven
sophomore, moved up to the
varsity and became the ace of the
staff, winning 12 games. Bob
Kammeyer earned All-Conference
honors by virtue of his great Pac-8
play. Bruce Schoen and Jim Coate
provided the experience on the
staff, though both ended up hard
luck pitchers in the true sense of
the word.
When all is said and done, it
will be the offensive power that
must take the credit for the brunt
of this season's success. Coach
Ray Young captured the essence
of this power when he observed,
"Stanford has never had three
better overall power hitters than
Mike Nelson, Rod Boone, and
Mark Lucich."
The biggest weaknesses that
plagued the Indians throughout
the season and most noticeably in
the USC and Washington State
playoff games were the lack of
consistency and defensive lapses.
Young lamented, "If we just had a
bit more consistency, we would

have had it. In two innings out of
the tournament we blew it, but
this is the sign of a young club."
Indians Lose Five Men
From this year's team the
Indians lose five seniors of whom
two are dependable pitchers,
Coate Schoen, and two are this
year's captains, Dick Borchers and
Bob Marshall, labelled by Young
"as invaluable leaders and major
reasons for this year's success."
But Young has all his steady
infielders, Lucich, Dave Edson,
and A 1 O'Brien, and outfielders,
Boone, Nelson, and Kevin Cronin,
along with two of his ace hurlers,
Kammeyer and Shaw. His
catchers, Bob Reece and Glen
Johnson, he rates as the best in
the conference.
Young feels that third base and
center field will be the major
holes to be plugged defensively.
The pitching needs to be shored
up, but Young has three transfers
who sat out this year and should
step in to the staff next season.
His top four high school prospects
all signed letters of intent and
should help out both the pitching
and the defense.
As icing on the cake, Young
happily notes that he'll have more
players playing semi-pro summer

baseball than he's had since he's
been coach. Virtually all of his
starters will see action in leagues
from Alaska to the Basin League
in the Dakotas.
The new Pac-8 division
allignments put Stanford in a
tough position, having to face
powerhouse USC and UCLA more
often and having to beat out the
Trojans for first place. None of
the southern teams were overly
excited about bailing the northern
squads out of financial trouble
while also giving them temporarily
an easier division.
Young sees as the silver lining
in the cloud the better
competition that the Indians will
face day in and day out. He feels
that Stanford will have the
advantage because the Indians will
be matching their top three
hurlers against the other teams in
three consecutive games over a
weekend rather than three one
shot affairs in which a USC could
hurl its ace every time.
Given Stanford's incredible
depth next year, even if some of
the transfers and prospects pan
out, the Cards should find
themselves looking down at the
Trojans rather than this year's
decidedly different view.

hopes next year. The Indians have a host of returnees to boost hopes.

powerhouse USC and UCLA more
often and having to beat out the
Trojans for first place. None of
the southern teams were overly
excited about bailing the northern
squads out of financial trouble
while also giving them temporarily
an easier division.
Young sees as the silver lining
in the cloud the better
competition that the Indians will
face day in and day out. He feels
that Stanford will have the
advantage because the Indians will
be matching their top three
hurlers against the other teams in
three consecutive games over a
weekend rather than three one
shot affairs in which a USC could
hurl its ace every time.
Given Stanford's incredible
depth next year, even if some of
the transfers and prospects pan
out, the Cards should find
themselves looking down at the
Trojans rather than this year's
decidedly different view.

MAJOR HOPE—i Streaking freshman Mark Lucich will be a major figure in any Stanford championship
hopes next year. The Indians have a host of returnees to boost hopes.
The abrupt collapse of the
baseball team in the hinterlands of
the North left most Stanford
buffs sourly lamenting another
choke, but the tournament play
actually mirrored the whole
exciting season of the young
Cards in both the magnificent
heights to which they could rise
and the unexplainable blunders
that they were so capable of
perpetrating.
The Indians so often blasted an
opposing pitcher for four runs in
one inning only to blow their lead
with the same number of errors in
the next frame. The end result
would be usually a dramatic
Stanford comeback to win in the
ninth. The Cards combined the
excitement of the early Mets'
teams with a propensity to win
that New York's wonders never
approached.
No one dared to concede either
a playoff berth or a 159-20 record
to Stanford after looking at the
team on paper at the beginning of
the year. The team had only five
seniors on a roster of 2 0 players
and most of the rest were untried
freshmen and sophomores. The
pitching staff was crippled by the
loss of ace Steve Dunning who

graduated to the Cleveland
Indians.
Pitching Came Through
Yet it was the pitching that
came through and provided the
decisive wins in the games that
counted. Dan Shaw, an unproven
sophomore, moved up to the
varsity and became the ace of the
staff, winning 12 games. Bob
Kammeyer earned All-Conference
honors by virtue of his great Pac-8
play. Bruce Schoen and Jim Coate
provided the experience on the
staff, though both ended up hard
luck pitchers in the true sense of
the word.
When all is said and done, it
will be the offensive power that
must take the credit for the brunt
of this season's success. Coach
Ray Young captured the essence
of this power when he observed,
"Stanford has never had three
better overall power hitters than
Mike Nelson, Rod Boone, and
Mark Lucich."
The biggest weaknesses that
plagued the Indians throughout
the season and most noticeably in
the USC and Washington State
playoff games were the lack of
consistency and defensive lapses.
Young lamented, "If we just had a
bit more consistency, we would

have had it. In two innings out of
the tournament we blew it, but
this is the sign of a young club."
Indians Lose Five Men
From this year's team the
Indians lose five seniors of whom
two are dependable pitchers,
Coate Schoen, and two are this
year's captains, Dick Borchers and
Bob Marshall, labelled by Young
"as invaluable leaders and major
reasons for this year's success."
But Young has all his steady
infielders, Lucich, Dave Edson,
and A 1 O'Brien, and outfielders,
Boone, Nelson, and Kevin Cronin,
along with two of his ace hurlers,
Kammeyer and Shaw. His
catchers, Bob Reece and Glen
Johnson, he rates as the best in
the conference.
Young feels that third base and
center field will be the major
holes to be plugged defensively.
The pitching needs to be shored
up, but Young has three transfers
who sat out this year and should
step in to the staff next season.
His top four high school prospects
all signed letters of intent and
should help out both the pitching
and the defense.
As icing on the cake, Young
happily notes that he'll have more
players playing semi-pro summer

baseball than he's had since he's
been coach. Virtually all of his
starters will see action in leagues
from Alaska to the Basin League
in the Dakotas.

allignments put Stanford in a
