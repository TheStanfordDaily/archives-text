# Trackmen To Compete In NCAA's
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
Coach Pay ton Jordan came
into this 1971 track season with a
fine array of top individual
performers and a traditional depth
problem. The Indians were
impressive early in the year
against non-conference
competition, but the Pac-8 once
again produced phenomenal
trackmen who ran right by all but
the most talented of Jordan's
men.
The trackmen finished with a
4-5 dual meet record with their
only Pac-8 victory coming in the
big meet against California.
Stanford lost to UCLA, USC,
Oregon, Oregon State, and
Washington and placed sixth in
the conference meet. Injuries and
lack of depth plagued the Cards
all season and doomed them to
defeat in a conference that
contains the top four squads in
the country.
Kardong Comes Through
One of the individual highlights
for the Indians this year was the
tremendous long distance running
of two time All-American Don
Kardong. Proving his credentials

before a west coast television
audience, Kardong ran with Steve
Prefontaine of Oregon to the wire
in the Pac-8 three mile and
finished second in an all-time
Stanford record of 13 :20.7.
Kardong and Prefontaine rank
far above any other college runner
in the three mile, and the Indian
star should pick up points for the
Cards in the NCAA meet at
Seattle this June.
Intermediate hurdler Randy
White emerged as a nationally
ranked runner this season,
lowering his time to the third best
in the country, 50.7. White
enjoyed an undefeated season
until the Pac-8 meet when he was
upset by Jim Seymour of
Washington. Possessing the
potential to lower his time to

below 5 0 .0, White will be a threat
in the NCAA's.
High hurdler Rick Tipton
placed second in the Pac-B's and
has run a 13.7 this year. Tipton
racked up many points this season
and although he will have stiff
competition in the nationals he
could easily place and gain
All-American status.
The only other sure competitor
for Stanford will be Arvid Kretz
in the six mile run. Coach Jordan
has four other men who have to
improve in order to represent the
Cards in June.
Chuck Francis won the most
points this year through his
excellent running in the 100 and
the 2 20. Hampered by muscle
injuries that kept him out of the
finals at the Pac-8 meet, Francis is
aiming for the NCAA meet and

the Canadian National
Championships. His best times
this year of 9.5 and 21 .2 put him
in national contention.
Meredith Questionable
Triple jumper Allen Meredith
won the Pac-8 last year but did
not place last week as six other
jumpers got off tremendous leaps.
Although Meredith has jumped
eight inches over the national
qualifying mark of 4 9-3, he will
have to improve to stand a chance
in national competition.
Pole vaulter Casey Carrigan is
in the same position as Meredith,
having met the qualifying mark
but needing improvement to make
the trip to Seattle worthwhile.
Carrigan also did not place in the
confer- nee meet and will have to
consistently vault over this
season's best mark of 16-7 in

order to have hopes in national
competition.
Tom Anderson, Indian long
jumper, got off the best jump of
his life in the Pac-8 meet, 25-2+.
This mark was only good enough
for sixth place, however, and
although he has qualified
nationally, Anderson will have to
improve his life-best mark in order
to do well in the NCAA's.
Coach Jordan has these eight
NCAA hopefuls working out and
competing in post-season meets in
order to sharpen their skills. The
trackmen will run in the Modesto
games this weekend, the Kennedy
Games on June 5 , and the AAU
Championships on June 1 2.
NCAA Favorites
UCLA, USC, Oregon, Cal,
Kansas, and Villanova are the top
ranked teams in the national
coiiegiate championships
according to Coach Jordan. This
roster attests to the strength of
the Pac-8 in that four out of the
top six squads are in the
conference.
Although as many as eight
athletes will continue
competition, the season is over for
most of the Stanford trackmen.
The squad will lose 14 men to
graduation, many of them top
performers.
Jordan assessed next year's
prospects. "We will have a depth
problem again and it does not
look like we will have the number
of outstanding individuals we did
this season. 1 am proud of this
year's team, however, and sure
that the younger athletes will
continue their hard work and reap
the rewards that will result.
"This year's team did the best
job they could in the most
powerful track conference in the
country and if the spirit carries on
into next \ ear. we will be fine."

standout 6'B" Mike Mann, the return of numerous lettermen and top
prospect Rick Kelly, a seven footer, the Indians hold promise for the
future.

Championships on June 1 2.
NCAA Favorites
UCLA, USC, Oregon, Cal,
Kansas, and Villanova are the top
ranked teams in the national
coiiegiate championships
according to Coach Jordan. This
roster attests to the strength of
the Pac-8 in that four out of the
top six squads are in the
conference.
Although as many as eight
athletes will continue
competition, the season is over for
most of the Stanford trackmen.
The squad will lose 14 men to
graduation, many of them top
performers.
Jordan assessed next year's
prospects. "We will have a depth
problem again and it does not
look like we will have the number
of outstanding individuals we did
this season. 1 am proud of this
year's team, however, and sure
that the younger athletes will
continue their hard work and reap
the rewards that will result.
"This year's team did the best
job they could in the most
powerful track conference in the
country and if the spirit carries on
into next \ ear. we will be fine."


ALL-AMERICAN CANDIDATE—CIaude Terry duels with USC guard

FUTURE SPEEDSTERS—Freshman Ken Curl passes the baton to John Anderson against OSU. Both will
be back next year to brighten Payton Jordan's life. The two must help make up for the loss of 14 seniors
from this year's sixth place Pac-8 finishers.
Coach Pay ton Jordan came
into this 1971 track season with a
fine array of top individual
performers and a traditional depth
problem. The Indians were
impressive early in the year
against non-conference
competition, but the Pac-8 once
again produced phenomenal
trackmen who ran right by all but
the most talented of Jordan's
men.
The trackmen finished with a
4-5 dual meet record with their
only Pac-8 victory coming in the
big meet against California.
Stanford lost to UCLA, USC,
Oregon, Oregon State, and
Washington and placed sixth in
the conference meet. Injuries and
lack of depth plagued the Cards
all season and doomed them to
defeat in a conference that
contains the top four squads in
the country.
Kardong Comes Through
One of the individual highlights
for the Indians this year was the
tremendous long distance running
of two time All-American Don
Kardong. Proving his credentials

before a west coast television
audience, Kardong ran with Steve
Prefontaine of Oregon to the wire
in the Pac-8 three mile and
finished second in an all-time
Stanford record of 13 :20.7.
Kardong and Prefontaine rank
far above any other college runner
in the three mile, and the Indian
star should pick up points for the
Cards in the NCAA meet at
Seattle this June.
Intermediate hurdler Randy
White emerged as a nationally
ranked runner this season,
lowering his time to the third best
in the country, 50.7. White
enjoyed an undefeated season
until the Pac-8 meet when he was
upset by Jim Seymour of
Washington. Possessing the
potential to lower his time to

below 5 0 .0, White will be a threat
in the NCAA's.
High hurdler Rick Tipton
placed second in the Pac-B's and
has run a 13.7 this year. Tipton
racked up many points this season
and although he will have stiff
competition in the nationals he
could easily place and gain
All-American status.
The only other sure competitor
for Stanford will be Arvid Kretz
in the six mile run. Coach Jordan
has four other men who have to
improve in order to represent the
Cards in June.
Chuck Francis won the most
points this year through his
excellent running in the 100 and
the 2 20. Hampered by muscle
injuries that kept him out of the
finals at the Pac-8 meet, Francis is
aiming for the NCAA meet and

the Canadian National
Championships. His best times
this year of 9.5 and 21 .2 put him
in national contention.
Meredith Questionable
Triple jumper Allen Meredith
won the Pac-8 last year but did
not place last week as six other
jumpers got off tremendous leaps.
Although Meredith has jumped
eight inches over the national
qualifying mark of 4 9-3, he will
have to improve to stand a chance
in national competition.
Pole vaulter Casey Carrigan is
in the same position as Meredith,
having met the qualifying mark
but needing improvement to make
the trip to Seattle worthwhile.
Carrigan also did not place in the
confer- nee meet and will have to
consistently vault over this
season's best mark of 16-7 in

order to have hopes in national
competition.
Tom Anderson, Indian long
jumper, got off the best jump of
his life in the Pac-8 meet, 25-2+.
This mark was only good enough
for sixth place, however, and
although he has qualified
nationally, Anderson will have to
improve his life-best mark in order
to do well in the NCAA's.
Coach Jordan has these eight
NCAA hopefuls working out and
competing in post-season meets in
order to sharpen their skills. The
trackmen will run in the Modesto
games this weekend, the Kennedy
Games on June 5 , and the AAU
Championships on June 1 2.

Chuck Francis won the most
points this year through his
excellent running in the 100 and
the 2 20. Hampered by muscle
injuries that kept him out of the
finals at the Pac-8 meet, Francis is
aiming for the NCAA meet and

the Canadian National
Championships. His best times
this year of 9.5 and 21 .2 put him
in national contention.
Meredith Questionable
Triple jumper Allen Meredith
won the Pac-8 last year but did
not place last week as six other
jumpers got off tremendous leaps.
Although Meredith has jumped
eight inches over the national
qualifying mark of 4 9-3, he will
have to improve to stand a chance
in national competition.
Pole vaulter Casey Carrigan is
in the same position as Meredith,
having met the qualifying mark
but needing improvement to make
the trip to Seattle worthwhile.
Carrigan also did not place in the
confer- nee meet and will have to
consistently vault over this
season's best mark of 16-7 in

order to have hopes in national
competition.
Tom Anderson, Indian long
jumper, got off the best jump of
his life in the Pac-8 meet, 25-2+.
This mark was only good enough
for sixth place, however, and
although he has qualified
nationally, Anderson will have to
improve his life-best mark in order
to do well in the NCAA's.
Coach Jordan has these eight
NCAA hopefuls working out and
competing in post-season meets in
order to sharpen their skills. The
trackmen will run in the Modesto
games this weekend, the Kennedy
Games on June 5 , and the AAU
Championships on June 1 2.
NCAA Favorites
UCLA, USC, Oregon, Cal,
Kansas, and Villanova are the top
ranked teams in the national
coiiegiate championships
according to Coach Jordan. This
roster attests to the strength of
the Pac-8 in that four out of the
top six squads are in the
conference.
Although as many as eight
athletes will continue
competition, the season is over for
most of the Stanford trackmen.
The squad will lose 14 men to
graduation, many of them top
performers.
Jordan assessed next year's
prospects. "We will have a depth
problem again and it does not
look like we will have the number
of outstanding individuals we did
this season. 1 am proud of this
year's team, however, and sure
that the younger athletes will
continue their hard work and reap
the rewards that will result.
"This year's team did the best
job they could in the most
powerful track conference in the
country and if the spirit carries on
into next \ ear. we will be fine."


ALL-AMERICAN CANDIDATE—CIaude Terry duels with USC guard
Paul Westfall. Terry will be a definite All-America candidate for
Howie Dallmar's cagers next year. With the addition of freshman
standout 6'B" Mike Mann, the return of numerous lettermen and top
prospect Rick Kelly, a seven footer, the Indians hold promise for the
future.

FUTURE SPEEDSTERS—Freshman Ken Curl passes the baton to John Anderson against OSU. Both will
be back next year to brighten Payton Jordan's life. The two must help make up for the loss of 14 seniors
from this year's sixth place Pac-8 finishers.
Coach Pay ton Jordan came
into this 1971 track season with a
fine array of top individual
performers and a traditional depth
problem. The Indians were
impressive early in the year
against non-conference
competition, but the Pac-8 once
again produced phenomenal
trackmen who ran right by all but
the most talented of Jordan's
men.
The trackmen finished with a
4-5 dual meet record with their
only Pac-8 victory coming in the
big meet against California.
Stanford lost to UCLA, USC,
Oregon, Oregon State, and
Washington and placed sixth in
the conference meet. Injuries and
lack of depth plagued the Cards
all season and doomed them to
defeat in a conference that
contains the top four squads in
the country.
Kardong Comes Through
One of the individual highlights
for the Indians this year was the
tremendous long distance running
of two time All-American Don
Kardong. Proving his credentials

before a west coast television
audience, Kardong ran with Steve
Prefontaine of Oregon to the wire
in the Pac-8 three mile and
finished second in an all-time
Stanford record of 13 :20.7.
Kardong and Prefontaine rank
far above any other college runner
in the three mile, and the Indian
star should pick up points for the
Cards in the NCAA meet at
Seattle this June.
Intermediate hurdler Randy
White emerged as a nationally
ranked runner this season,
lowering his time to the third best
in the country, 50.7. White
enjoyed an undefeated season
until the Pac-8 meet when he was
upset by Jim Seymour of
Washington. Possessing the
potential to lower his time to

below 5 0 .0, White will be a threat
in the NCAA's.
High hurdler Rick Tipton
placed second in the Pac-B's and
has run a 13.7 this year. Tipton
racked up many points this season
and although he will have stiff
competition in the nationals he
could easily place and gain
All-American status.
The only other sure competitor
for Stanford will be Arvid Kretz
in the six mile run. Coach Jordan
has four other men who have to
improve in order to represent the
Cards in June.
Chuck Francis won the most
points this year through his
excellent running in the 100 and
the 2 20. Hampered by muscle
injuries that kept him out of the
finals at the Pac-8 meet, Francis is
aiming for the NCAA meet and

the Canadian National
Championships. His best times
