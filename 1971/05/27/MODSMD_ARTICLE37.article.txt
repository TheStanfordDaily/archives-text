# Golfers Eye NCAA Chance
## 
### CHARLIE HOFFMAN 
On April 15, the nation's golf
coaches ranked Stanford sixth and
yesterday Coach Bud Finger's
linksters received an invitation to
this year's NCAA Championship
meet to be held at the University
of Arizona from June 21-2,6.
The Indians added strength to
their national title hopes with an
impressive victory in the U.S.
Collegiate Invitational and a dual
meet win over USC. It appeared
that everything was going well for
the Cards, but a poor third place
finish in the Pac-8 tournament has
cast considerable doubt upon
their chances in national
competition this summer.
Stanford breezed through the
dual meet season with a 10-2
record before the UCLA match on
May 15. San Jose State defeated

the Indians twice in dual matches
and gained an NCAA invitation
for its accomplishments. Yet the
Cards had downed Cal twice and
USC once and appeared ready to
dispose of a weak UCLA team and
successfully defend their Pac-8
title.
The squad suffered a
disheartening loss to the Bruins,
however, and then lost the 36
hole lead in the conference
tourney and faded to third.
Although the team still has a
coveted NCAA invitation, the
question remains whether the
golfers can pull everything
together and play up to the
potential that has placed them in
the top ten in the past two
national championships.
Senior Tom Watson has played
excellent golf this year, winning
the U.S. Collegiate Invitational.

He has consistently been the top
performer for the Cards this
season and will lead Stanford into
the national championship. Last
year, Watson shot a one over par
289 to tie for fifth in the NCAA's.
He ranks among the top young
golfers in the country and his
departure from the Indian golf
scene will dim the team's future
hopes.
The big surprise for this year's
squad has been the fine play of
sophomore John Beers. He shot a
299 in the Pac-8 tournament to
place ninth. Improving
consistently throughout the
season, Beers should be a great
asset in the NCAA's.
Gary Vanier began the spring
with an impressive victory in the
San Francisco City
Championships. The quality of his
play fell off, however, and Vanier
shot a disappointing 306 in the
conference meet compared to his
score of 295 last year. If the
squad expects to challenge for the
national title, Vanier is going to
have to return to past form.
Another Indian golfer who has
had troubles this season has been
Pete Harpster whose usually
consistent game has not come
together this spring. Harpster
finished the Pac-8 tourney with if
308 in contrast to his 301 score of
19 70. Another key to the Indian's
title hopes will be the return to
form of Harpster by the time the
NCAA's roll around.
Finger has four of his golfers
competing over 5 4 holes for the
fifth spot on the NCAA team.
Dennis Conrad, Jim Dwulet, Clem
Richardson, and Jeff Heiser will
vie for the position.
Coach Finger has built a
national golf power here, but
emphasizes that, "We will have to
play fantastic golf to win the
national title. Good golf will put
us in the top ten as in past years,
but we have the potential to get
everything straightened out and
win it all."
The Indians have had a fine
season but must get all of their
players in top form before June
21 in order to stand a chance of
attaining top national honors.


SHOOTING FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP-Tom Watson will load the
Stanford golf team to the NCAA tournament at the University of
Arizona June 21-26.
