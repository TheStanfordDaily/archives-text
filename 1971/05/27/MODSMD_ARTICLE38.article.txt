# Four Card Netmen Brace For NCAA
## 
### CHRIS COUNIHAN 
Coach Dick Gould's tennis
team ended one of their best
seasons ever with a spirited
victory over Cal after a
disheartening loss to USC, in the
consolation round of the Pac-8
championships. A four man squad
will go to the NCAA's to be held
at Notre Dame from June 14-19.
The Indian netmen had one of
the finest teams in the school's
history and lost only twice during
the regular season. Both losses
came at the hands of UCLA,
considered the best tennis team in
the country. Coach Gould called
the season "outstanding. This
was the best tennis season here in
25-30 years. The boys competed
very well and they won some
important matches."
Indeed the tennis team
performed well. Their two wins
over USC haven't been recorded
in a long time. The Trojans, along
with cross-town rival UCLA,
have always been national powers
in tennis. The netmen's 20-3 slate
indicates the excellence of the
program this year. Stanford now
must be considered one of the top
five teams in the country.
The individual records reflect
the team's fine performance. In
dual matches number one man for
the Cards, Roscoe Tanner, lost,
only twice during the season, both
times to UCLA's Jeff Borowiak.
Frosh Sandy Mayer, number two

man, was 16-4 and senior Stan
Pasarell at number three was 11-3.
The set-up in the NCAA's is in
the format of a tournament. Each
team will send four players. Each
match won by a player gains a
point for that school. There will
be both singles and doubles
competition. Gould rates UCLA
as "odds-on favorites" to win, but
"if everything goes right Stanford
could possibly take all." Besides
Stanford, USC, and Cal, other
nationally ranked teams will
compete for top honors. Trinity
(Texas), with former Stanford
player Paul Gerkin, Rice, and
Miami all will be trying for a piece
of the action. Stanford, USC, and
Trinity along with UCLA, of
course, should make up the top
four.
Gould will send his top four
players to Notre Dame: Tanner,
Mayer, Rick Fisher and Pasarell all
may be seeded. Tanner should be
in the top eight. Borowiak of the
Bruins, as defending champion,
will be seeded first. His teammate
Jimmy Connors, also should be
ranked high.
In the doubles the Card duo of
Tanner and Mayer should be
seeded in the top eight. Both of
UCLA's first two doubles combos
have beaten Mayer and Tanner
and should be seeded one-two in
the tournament.
ITiough the Indian netmen had
a fine season this year, next year
they should be even better. Only
senior Stan Pasarell will graduate.

"We will miss Stanley a great
deal," says Gould, "but 1 am very
optimistic about next year."
The open vacancy may be
filled by any one of a number of
players. Two possibilities are Tim
Noonan who played right below
the varsity on the ladder, and
John Wright who sat out the year
with a broken leg.
'I\vo top high school seniors
who have written letters of intent
to Stanford also may play on the
varsity next year. Jimmy Delaney,
who may be named to the Junior
Davis Cup team and Chip Fisher
will add depth to the squad next
year.
Stanford's opponents will be
hurt much more by graduation
than the Cards. USC's Tom

Leonard has already lost his
eligibility. Also graduating from
the Trojans are Mike Taylor and
Nick Gentille. This leaves USC
with only four of their top seven
returning. The Bruins lose Jeff
Borowiak, Vasque/., and Alvarez
so they too should be weaker nekt
year. These losses considerably
heighten the possibility for a
Pac-8 championship and perhaps a
national title for Gould's squad.
After the NCAA's this year the
top six players on the Stanford
squad along with freshman Tim
Noonan, will play the national
circuit this summer. Tanner and
Mayer and possibly others on the
team will be at Forest Hills, the
most prestigious tournament held
in the U.S.

five teams in the country.
The individual records reflect
the team's fine performance. In
dual matches number one man for
the Cards, Roscoe Tanner, lost,
only twice during the season, both
times to UCLA's Jeff Borowiak.
Frosh Sandy Mayer, number two

man, was 16-4 and senior Stan
Pasarell at number three was 11-3.
The set-up in the NCAA's is in
the format of a tournament. Each
team will send four players. Each
match won by a player gains a
point for that school. There will
be both singles and doubles
competition. Gould rates UCLA
as "odds-on favorites" to win, but
"if everything goes right Stanford
could possibly take all." Besides
Stanford, USC, and Cal, other
nationally ranked teams will
compete for top honors. Trinity
(Texas), with former Stanford
player Paul Gerkin, Rice, and
Miami all will be trying for a piece
of the action. Stanford, USC, and
Trinity along with UCLA, of
course, should make up the top
four.
Gould will send his top four
players to Notre Dame: Tanner,
Mayer, Rick Fisher and Pasarell all
may be seeded. Tanner should be
in the top eight. Borowiak of the
Bruins, as defending champion,
will be seeded first. His teammate
Jimmy Connors, also should be
ranked high.
In the doubles the Card duo of
Tanner and Mayer should be
seeded in the top eight. Both of
UCLA's first two doubles combos
have beaten Mayer and Tanner
and should be seeded one-two in
the tournament.
ITiough the Indian netmen had
a fine season this year, next year
they should be even better. Only
senior Stan Pasarell will graduate.

"We will miss Stanley a great
deal," says Gould, "but 1 am very
optimistic about next year."
The open vacancy may be
filled by any one of a number of
players. Two possibilities are Tim
Noonan who played right below
the varsity on the ladder, and
John Wright who sat out the year
with a broken leg.
'I\vo top high school seniors
who have written letters of intent
to Stanford also may play on the
varsity next year. Jimmy Delaney,
who may be named to the Junior
Davis Cup team and Chip Fisher
will add depth to the squad next
year.
Stanford's opponents will be
hurt much more by graduation
than the Cards. USC's Tom

Leonard has already lost his
eligibility. Also graduating from
the Trojans are Mike Taylor and
Nick Gentille. This leaves USC
with only four of their top seven
returning. The Bruins lose Jeff
Borowiak, Vasque/., and Alvarez
so they too should be weaker nekt
year. These losses considerably
heighten the possibility for a
Pac-8 championship and perhaps a
national title for Gould's squad.
After the NCAA's this year the
top six players on the Stanford
squad along with freshman Tim
Noonan, will play the national
circuit this summer. Tanner and
Mayer and possibly others on the
team will be at Forest Hills, the
most prestigious tournament held
in the U.S.

CONSULTING WITH THE COACH-Roscoe Tanner consults with
Dick Gould in one of his tighter moments during the season. Gould
sees a possibility for uppsetting UCLA.
Coach Dick Gould's tennis
team ended one of their best
seasons ever with a spirited
victory over Cal after a
disheartening loss to USC, in the
consolation round of the Pac-8
championships. A four man squad
will go to the NCAA's to be held
at Notre Dame from June 14-19.
The Indian netmen had one of
the finest teams in the school's
history and lost only twice during
the regular season. Both losses
came at the hands of UCLA,
considered the best tennis team in
the country. Coach Gould called
the season "outstanding. This
was the best tennis season here in
25-30 years. The boys competed
very well and they won some
important matches."
Indeed the tennis team
performed well. Their two wins
over USC haven't been recorded
in a long time. The Trojans, along
with cross-town rival UCLA,
have always been national powers
in tennis. The netmen's 20-3 slate
indicates the excellence of the
program this year. Stanford now
must be considered one of the top
five teams in the country.
