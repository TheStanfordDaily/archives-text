failure at his campus home early

school students and factors
contributing to the counter-culture in
America at the time of his
death. Prof. Bernard Cohen,
chairman of the Sociology Department,

community have suffered a deep loss.

"His contributions to our knowledge
of the family will hold a central place
in the development of sociology. His
active involvement in the community
and the University in the cause of peace
was a guiding light for his colleagues
and his students."
Born in Ottawa, Canada, in July 30,
1910 of Russian parents, Wallin later
became a U.S. citizen. He received his
bachelor of arts degree at the
University of Manitoba in 1930,
majoring in English and sociology. He
