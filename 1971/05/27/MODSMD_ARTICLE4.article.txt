# Faculty Debates On KZSU
## 
### KATHLEEN MORTON 
"Sponsored research does not compromise the integrity
nor warp the goals of the University," stated Robert L.
White, professor of electrical engineering and materials
sciences, during last night's faculty debate on KZSU.
White responded to charges by H. Pierre Noyes,
professor at SLAC, and Matin Camey, assistant professor of
education, that the University is molded by the demands
and conditions attached to sponsored research.
The debate, fourth in a series of debates between faculty
members, concerned the role of the University as critic,
trainer of technocrats, and world problem solver.
Trainer of Technocrats
Noyes and Carnoy criticized the university in its role as
a trainer of technocrats. Carnoy indicated that the
University is a service industry, filling mainly the needs of
large corporations and government; its role as critic has
suffered dramatically.
Both White and Robert C. Lind, associate professor of
engineering - economic systems and director of Public
Policy Analysis, responded that the University must be
both critic and problem solver; it cannot be insensitive to
the needs of society.
In rebuttal to Noyes' charge that the University expands
only in those areas funded through sponsored research,
White argued that, "the sciences are self-sufficient... if
anything, they contribute thirty to forty cents on the
dollar to the general fund. In the past few years the

University has spent a great amount on raising the stature
of its humanities departments. English has rise from
fifteenth to sixth, history from fifteenth to fifth, and
classics from fifteenth to fourth. On the other hand,
physics went from sixth to fifth, while E.E. remained stable
at first or second."
Provost William Miller, moderator of the debate, first
proposed the idea of an experimental series of debates "to
explore issues in an informed and disciplined manner. All
too often, adherents of a given position speak only to those
who agree with them. In these debates, the fundamental
assumptions underlying the major questions can be placed
side by side and cross-examined in a structured format."
Intellectual Development
Next week's forum will discuss the theory that
"developing knowledge and intellectual competence must
take priority over involvement in immediate social
problems if the university is to fulfill its obligations to
society." Debaters will include Bernard Cohen of sociology
and Martin Evans of English, in favor or the resolution, and
David Abernathy of political science and Robert Madix of
chemical engineering against.
"This is an experimental series, but interest is
developing," said Andres Doty of University Public
relations. "Two faculty groups have shown interest and
expressed the hope that the debates will continue."
Doty also indicated that feed-back from the KZSU
audience has also been favorable and that students have
responded well.

Provost William Miller, moderator of the debate, first
proposed the idea of an experimental series of debates "to
explore issues in an informed and disciplined manner. All
too often, adherents of a given position speak only to those
who agree with them. In these debates, the fundamental
assumptions underlying the major questions can be placed
side by side and cross-examined in a structured format."
Intellectual Development
Next week's forum will discuss the theory that
"developing knowledge and intellectual competence must
take priority over involvement in immediate social
problems if the university is to fulfill its obligations to
society." Debaters will include Bernard Cohen of sociology
and Martin Evans of English, in favor or the resolution, and
David Abernathy of political science and Robert Madix of
chemical engineering against.
"This is an experimental series, but interest is
developing," said Andres Doty of University Public
relations. "Two faculty groups have shown interest and
expressed the hope that the debates will continue."
Doty also indicated that feed-back from the KZSU
audience has also been favorable and that students have
responded well.
