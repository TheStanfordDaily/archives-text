BSU Comments
In a statement released yesterday
afternoon, the Black Students Union
commented on the results of the
plebeceite conducted last week.
The statement, signed by BSU
Chairman Willie Newberry, expressed
the hope "that the response of the
Stanford Administration to the
Plebescite, will be such as to
communicate to Black Americans, that,
at least on university campuses, the
ballot is considered an effective as well
as acceptable means of achieving
institutional reform."
Both resolutions passed by an
approximately two-to-one margin.
Drugs Measured
A Stanford Hospital Research team
has developed a new program for
monitoring the body concentration of
important therapeutic drugs.
Dr. Paul Wolf, director of clinical
laboratories, and Dr. Sumner Kalman,
professor of pharmacology at the
School of Medicine, announced
yesterday that the program is now
being made available for use in the
clinical laboratories at the hospital.
"Our purpose," Kalman explained,
"is to detect and measure drugs
administered to a patient, and
determine how the body handles them.
This allows doctors to more effectively
maintain proper drug levels in the
patient's bloodstream."

Black Caucus
A Black Caucus organized at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
last November has scheduled a noon
rally today outside the SLAC cafeteria.
Hiring and firing policies and other
practices will be discussed, according
to caucus member Archie Moore, Jr.
The group is headed by Cornell
Watson, an electronics engineer at
SLAC. They have already met with
SLAC director Wolfgang Panofsky to
discuss minority worker relations and
training programs.
"We have connections with other
black ethnic groups on campus such as
the BSU (Black Student Union)," said
Moore. "We share their views and they
are willing to give us support." In
addition the caucus stands behind all
the' demands which the BSU recently
presented here.
Bail Fund Bankrupt?
Less than $100 has been repaid to
the ASSU Bail Fund, according to its
director Ed Hayes. The Fund has
assisted 67 students with a total of
$2928 worth of loans ranging from
traffic warrants all the way to violent
demonstrations. To date, only $94 has
been repaid.
Hayes feels that the fund's major
problem is that it "cannot and was not
intended to give out long term loans."
The fund was established last year
after general recognition that such a
service available on an emergency basis
was needed. It is subsidized by funds

from the ASSU, $5000 of which have
been allocated to date. Loans are
extended on the understanding that
they be paid back and that an interest
rate of four percent accrue on those
payments which are delinquent.
Japan Trouble?
Since nearly every nation which
develops a highly technical society also
develops aggressive needs, the next
trouble-rnaker on the world scene may

be Japan. Prof. Robert North told a
seminar at the Medical School Tuesday
"Japan is now repeating th<
circumstances of 1938. While 1 am no
predicting another Pearl Harbor, w<
may very well have trouble during th
next decade."
Professor North, associate executiv
head of the Political Scie
Department, has studied national
and aggression beginning with tu
Franco-Prussian war of 1870, in man>
cases using computerized information

Japan Trouble?
Since nearly every nation which
develops a highly technical society also
develops aggressive needs, the next
trouble-rnaker on the world scene may

be Japan. Prof. Robert North told a
seminar at the Medical School Tuesday
"Japan is now repeating th<
circumstances of 1938. While 1 am no
predicting another Pearl Harbor, w<
may very well have trouble during th
next decade."

BSU Comments
In a statement released yesterday
afternoon, the Black Students Union
commented on the results of the
plebeceite conducted last week.
The statement, signed by BSU
Chairman Willie Newberry, expressed
the hope "that the response of the
Stanford Administration to the
Plebescite, will be such as to
communicate to Black Americans, that,
at least on university campuses, the
ballot is considered an effective as well
as acceptable means of achieving
institutional reform."
Both resolutions passed by an
approximately two-to-one margin.
Drugs Measured
A Stanford Hospital Research team
has developed a new program for
monitoring the body concentration of
important therapeutic drugs.
Dr. Paul Wolf, director of clinical
laboratories, and Dr. Sumner Kalman,
professor of pharmacology at the
School of Medicine, announced
yesterday that the program is now
being made available for use in the
clinical laboratories at the hospital.
"Our purpose," Kalman explained,
"is to detect and measure drugs
administered to a patient, and
determine how the body handles them.
This allows doctors to more effectively
maintain proper drug levels in the
patient's bloodstream."

Black Caucus
A Black Caucus organized at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
last November has scheduled a noon
rally today outside the SLAC cafeteria.
Hiring and firing policies and other
practices will be discussed, according
to caucus member Archie Moore, Jr.
The group is headed by Cornell
Watson, an electronics engineer at
SLAC. They have already met with
SLAC director Wolfgang Panofsky to
discuss minority worker relations and
training programs.
"We have connections with other
black ethnic groups on campus such as
the BSU (Black Student Union)," said
Moore. "We share their views and they
are willing to give us support." In
addition the caucus stands behind all
the' demands which the BSU recently
presented here.
Bail Fund Bankrupt?
Less than $100 has been repaid to
the ASSU Bail Fund, according to its
director Ed Hayes. The Fund has
assisted 67 students with a total of
$2928 worth of loans ranging from
traffic warrants all the way to violent
demonstrations. To date, only $94 has
been repaid.
Hayes feels that the fund's major
problem is that it "cannot and was not
intended to give out long term loans."
The fund was established last year
after general recognition that such a
service available on an emergency basis
was needed. It is subsidized by funds

from the ASSU, $5000 of which have
been allocated to date. Loans are
extended on the understanding that
they be paid back and that an interest
rate of four percent accrue on those
payments which are delinquent.
