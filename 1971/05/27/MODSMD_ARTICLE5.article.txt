# BAP Methods Under Fire
## 
### KATHY EISSLER TOM FLEMING 
Stanford is presently operating at a
deficit of nearly $900,000, and
administrators of the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) do not
expect to be out of the red until 1974
or 1975.
Earlier in the year the Carnegie
Commission stated that many of this
nation's schools are currently facing
financial disaster and are being forced
to initiate drastic reductions in their
curricula. Stanford's answer is BAP.
Now ending its first year, BAP's
purpose is to eliminate the University
deficit over a five-year period through a
program involving nearly $6 million in
income adjustments and budget
reductions.
Ray Bachetti, Assistant Provost, and
administrator in charge of BAP,
describes two directions open to budget
administrators: programs as a whole can
be limited, with all monies devoted to
maintaining the status quo; or drastic
reductions in certain programs can be
made, with all monies assigned to
innovation and improvement in existing
and new programs.
"You must stop some things in
order to do new things," states
Bachetti, explaining that the present
policy exercised by the BAP committee
is one of promoting growth,
experimentation and expansion.
Jim Baer, a junior and the sole
student member of the BAP advisory
committee of seven, claims that
"administration, research and company
contracts get much greater priority
than undergraduate instruction."
The crux of Baer's argument is that
undergraduate instruction, particularly
in the humanities, is outrageously
under-funded. His concerns can be
evidenced by what he terms "the loss
of an official Speech Department." No
graduate program and only three
professors remained this year; and
according to BAP's schedule for next

year only one professor will teach full
time, resulting in a saving of
approximately $40,000.
Baer feels that the problem of
bypassing undergraduate instruction is
closely tied to that of neglecting
humanities — in both cases
undergraduates are the main source of
enrollment. The humanities program
exists primarily for undergraduate
instruction and therefore lacks the
incentive of outside contracts for its
development.
Bachetti refutes the idea of slanted
spending as "nonsense ... No one has
said that speech instruction is not
worth doing. There never was an
official Speech Department; there is a
Speech and Drama Department with a
speech component of three professors.
Bachetti is of the opinion that there
may be new and hopefully better ways
of "incorporating speech-related
courses into the undergraduate
curriculum."

Baer sees another snag in BAP's
proposals in what he terms "the
dangerous power of the purse,"
referring to several unspecified funds
recently given to the Provost's office.
Among the funds established are a
$100,000 Provost Reserve, a $200,000
University Progress Fund, and an
additional $200,000 for a Research
Development Fund. Baer reasons that,
by their very nature, the latter two are
applicable only to science and graduate
programs.
Baer also points out there will be no
record of allocations—no evidence of
their usage—because of the unspecified
nature of the funds, opening
possibilities for power plays.
In particular, Baer questions the
support of rising administrative costs
(he estimates them to be $2 million per
year) while education suffers.
In rebuttal, Bachetti regards the
