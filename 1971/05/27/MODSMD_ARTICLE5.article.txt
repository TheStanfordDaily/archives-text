# BAP Methods Under Fire
## 
### KATHY EISSLER TOM FLEMING 
Stanford is presently operating at a
deficit of nearly $900,000, and
administrators of the Budget
Adjustment Program (BAP) do not
expect to be out of the red until 1974
or 1975.
Earlier in the year the Carnegie
Commission stated that many of this
nation's schools are currently facing
financial disaster and are being forced
to initiate drastic reductions in their
curricula. Stanford's answer is BAP.
Now ending its first year, BAP's
purpose is to eliminate the University
deficit over a five-year period through a
program involving nearly $6 million in
income adjustments and budget
reductions.
Ray Bachetti, Assistant Provost, and
administrator in charge of BAP,
describes two directions open to budget
administrators: programs as a whole can
be limited, with all monies devoted to
maintaining the status quo; or drastic
reductions in certain programs can be
made, with all monies assigned to
innovation and improvement in existing
and new programs.
"You must stop some things in
order to do new things," states
Bachetti, explaining that the present
policy exercised by the BAP committee
is one of promoting growth,
experimentation and expansion.
Jim Baer, a junior and the sole
student member of the BAP advisory
committee of seven, claims that
"administration, research and company
contracts get much greater priority
than undergraduate instruction."
The crux of Baer's argument is that
undergraduate instruction, particularly
in the humanities, is outrageously
under-funded. His concerns can be
evidenced by what he terms "the loss
of an official Speech Department." No
graduate program and only three
professors remained this year; and
according to BAP's schedule for next

year only one professor will teach full
time, resulting in a saving of
approximately $40,000.
Baer feels that the problem of
bypassing undergraduate instruction is
closely tied to that of neglecting
humanities — in both cases
undergraduates are the main source of
enrollment. The humanities program
exists primarily for undergraduate
instruction and therefore lacks the
incentive of outside contracts for its
development.
Bachetti refutes the idea of slanted
spending as "nonsense ... No one has
said that speech instruction is not
worth doing. There never was an
official Speech Department; there is a
Speech and Drama Department with a
speech component of three professors.
Bachetti is of the opinion that there
may be new and hopefully better ways
of "incorporating speech-related
courses into the undergraduate
curriculum."

Baer sees another snag in BAP's
proposals in what he terms "the
dangerous power of the purse,"
referring to several unspecified funds
recently given to the Provost's office.
Among the funds established are a
$100,000 Provost Reserve, a $200,000
University Progress Fund, and an
additional $200,000 for a Research
Development Fund. Baer reasons that,
by their very nature, the latter two are
applicable only to science and graduate
programs.
Baer also points out there will be no
record of allocations—no evidence of
their usage—because of the unspecified
nature of the funds, opening
possibilities for power plays.
In particular, Baer questions the
support of rising administrative costs
(he estimates them to be $2 million per
year) while education suffers.
In rebuttal, Bachetti regards the
funds as "necessary and important
innovations." He states that the
Progress Fund will serve to put
minority demands into effect. Increases
in the Research Development Fund are
justified by an increase of
approximately $500,000 in funds for
one of the less obvious "laboratories of
the humanities—the library."
As for the Provost Fund, Bachetti
states that it is simply practical
planning to have a "savings account" to
fall back on.
The structure of the BAP committee
also results in indiscriminate actions,
Baer contends. He sees the committee
as attacking the budget in a piecemeal
manner, department by department,
without consideration of the
community as a whole.
An extension of this lack of
community lies in the makeup of the
committee, Baer continues. Despite

effects on low income employees of the
university, no staff workers are present
on the BAP committee. Baer is the only
student on the committee.
Bachetti explains, however, that it is
not the purpose of the committee to be
representative. The original proposal
was to establish a group composed of
five faculty and two student members.
One student position is still open.
In effect, Bachetti rejects Baer's
theory of political manipulation right
down the line and is certain that
time—meaning the months to
come—will prove the invalidity of
Baer's fears.
"Hopefully we will achieve a
balanced budget by 1974 or '75. In the
interim we will be spending more than
we will take in. We want to avoid
taking sharp cuts without thinking of
the consequences to the university. We
need time to plan (to allow) damage to
the university (to be) as little as the
difficult circumstances will permit."
