# Date For Franklin To Be Set Next Week
## 
### 
The Faculty Advisory Board expects
to reach a decision early next week on
a date for its hearing of suspended
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin's
case, Chairman David Mason said late
yesterday afternoon.
The decision on a hearing date will
be made following a review by board
members of the transcript and notes of
a two hour discussion yesterday with
Franklin and counsel for the parties in
the case. This meeting was followed by
a two hour discussion among only
board members.
Franklin has asked a continuance in
his case until fall quarter. Charging that
the administration has deliberately
stalled his case, he claims they are now

trying to rush it so that his hearing will
be held during finals and dead week or
when no students are here.
The administration had originally
requested that his hearing be scheduled
for yesterday, but since Franklin's
attorney is currently overseas until
June 13, the board had granted "some
postponement" in the case.
Commenting on the possibility of a
summer date for his hearing, Franklin
said yesterday,"I wouldn't show up
because it would be impossible for me
to have a fair hearing; none of my
witnesses will be here."
At the beginning of yesterday's
meeting, about 20 persons, mainly
students, presented a petition with
what one spokesman estimated was
over 1,000 signatures requesting that
Franklin's case be continued until the
fall.
The petition, circulated during the
last two days, was delivered to
Professor Mason's office where
yesterday's meeting took place.
President Lyman has charged that
on February 10 "Professor Franklin
intentionally urged and incited other
persons present to engage in conduct
calculated to disrupt activities of the
University community and which
threatened injury' to individuals and
property."
Lyman filed formal charges with the
Advisory Board on March 22, asking
for Franklin's dismissal.
Commenting on the charges
yesterday, Franklin called them
"ridiculous." He added that after
listening to tapes of the speeches he
made on February 10, "it's amazing
they can prosecute."
The Advisory Board has meanwhile
made public a letter to President
Lyman and Professor Franklin detailing
its recent considerations concerning the
timing of the hearing. The full text of
the letter is printed on page 12 of
today's Daily.
Franklin's case is the first of its kind
in Stanford history.
