In yesterday's editorial on the proposed
assessment for a legal advocate for students
(Legal Offense), the Daily asked a series of
questions we felt needed answers before we
could support the proposal. Perhaps we did
not search far enough for the answers or
investigate the proposal sufficiently.
Since the editorial a few things have
come to our attention. Legal Offense, the
organization that would be granted the
funds for the legal advocate, is and has
been for six months an officially
recognized student organization, with its
by-laws on file with the ASSU. These
by-laws outline, if somewhat ambiguously,
the functions of the proposed legal
advocate and the procedure for his
selection.
Upon reading the by-laws new questions
and doubts have arisen in our mind. Some
of these questions have been answered (see
the column on this page).
Others have not. For instance, the
Student Senate will appoint a selection
committee to choose the lawyer. Bluntly,
we don't trust this year's Student Senate
and very possibly we won't trust next
year's either. It seems possible for the
Senate to arrange to appoint a lawyer who
might favor special interest groups. The
priorities for the use of his time are
ambiguous. Some of us feel that the legal
advocate could come to serve as the
exclusive attorney for the student
government instead of an attorney for the
students.

But what bothers us most is the lack of
community discussion on the proposed
assessment. $1 per student per quarter
comes to quite a sum of money-nearly
$40,000. A legal advocate is a new idea for
Stanford and not a simple one. We don't
fully understand its implications; we
suspect we are not unique in our confusion.
The election has been at best very
hurried -the Daily received the official
wording of the ballot Monday afternoon,
only one and one-half days before the
election. Clearly, more time is needed for
additional discussion.
We have been told that this proposal
uses as a model the legal advocate at San
Jose State College. Reportedly the system
works well there. We have also been told
that a legal advocate program at UC
Berkeley, with different guidelines, has not
worked well.
We would like to investigate the
programs at these places and evaluate them.
We would like time to carefully consider
this proposal and have as many of our
questions as possible answered (each time
we read the proposal we come up with new
ones).
Therefore, although we support the
concept of students having their own legal
advocate, we cannot support a proposal
when the issues have not been fully
discussed by all parties involved.
We ask that the proposal be considered
again next fall at a student election and
hope that full discussion will take place at
that time.

Therefore, although we support the
concept of students having their own legal
advocate, we cannot support a proposal
when the issues have not been fully
discussed by all parties involved.
We ask that the proposal be considered
again next fall at a student election and
hope that full discussion will take place at
that time.
In yesterday's editorial on the proposed
assessment for a legal advocate for students
(Legal Offense), the Daily asked a series of
questions we felt needed answers before we
could support the proposal. Perhaps we did
not search far enough for the answers or
investigate the proposal sufficiently.
Since the editorial a few things have
come to our attention. Legal Offense, the
organization that would be granted the
funds for the legal advocate, is and has
been for six months an officially
recognized student organization, with its
by-laws on file with the ASSU. These
by-laws outline, if somewhat ambiguously,
the functions of the proposed legal
advocate and the procedure for his
selection.
Upon reading the by-laws new questions
and doubts have arisen in our mind. Some
of these questions have been answered (see
the column on this page).
Others have not. For instance, the
Student Senate will appoint a selection
committee to choose the lawyer. Bluntly,
we don't trust this year's Student Senate
and very possibly we won't trust next
year's either. It seems possible for the
Senate to arrange to appoint a lawyer who
might favor special interest groups. The
priorities for the use of his time are
ambiguous. Some of us feel that the legal
advocate could come to serve as the
exclusive attorney for the student
government instead of an attorney for the
students.

But what bothers us most is the lack of
community discussion on the proposed
assessment. $1 per student per quarter
comes to quite a sum of money-nearly
$40,000. A legal advocate is a new idea for
Stanford and not a simple one. We don't
fully understand its implications; we
suspect we are not unique in our confusion.
The election has been at best very
hurried -the Daily received the official
wording of the ballot Monday afternoon,
only one and one-half days before the
election. Clearly, more time is needed for
additional discussion.
We have been told that this proposal
uses as a model the legal advocate at San
Jose State College. Reportedly the system
works well there. We have also been told
that a legal advocate program at UC
Berkeley, with different guidelines, has not
worked well.
We would like to investigate the
programs at these places and evaluate them.
We would like time to carefully consider
this proposal and have as many of our
questions as possible answered (each time
we read the proposal we come up with new
ones).
Therefore, although we support the
concept of students having their own legal
advocate, we cannot support a proposal
when the issues have not been fully
discussed by all parties involved.
We ask that the proposal be considered
again next fall at a student election and
hope that full discussion will take place at
that time.
