## Legal Offense Idea Defended 
### 
legal offense

Why has there been so little
publicity in support of the Legal
Offense ballot proposal?
To us the answer seems clear:
the idea of providing paid legal
services to students, through the
ASSU, has obvious merit. In this
area, students (especially foreign
Students) have been illegally
discriminated against in
attempting to find housing;
landlords have illegally withheld
"cleaning" deposits; students have
been taken to small claims court
Without understanding their rights
or have been confronted with
Confusing legal documents loaded
with small print which only a
lawyer could understand; and
dormitory residents increasingly
fear illegal search and seizure.
For the last several years many
individuals have attempted, in a
rather scattered manner, to aid
students with their legal problems.
Finally, Legal Offense, working in
conjunction with local lawyers,
has developed a comprehensive
plan to provide members of the
Stanford community with legal
advice on matters large and small.
Who are these people? Legal
Offense is an organization that has
been incorporated under the

ASSU in a manner similar to the
International Association, the
BSU, and The Company (the
undergraduate dramatic
association). Prior to the
incorporation last December, a
Constitution was filed with the
ASSU Office, and the Dean of
Students Office was notified that
the organization existed.
Legal Offense has undertaken
various activities. At the beginning
of this quarter, the organization
sponsored Jane Fonda's speech
about GI rights and the Peoples'
Peace Treaty. Other work has
involved the development of a
proposal for an ASSU Attorney.
Yesterday, the Daily and
others questioned a possible
vagueness in our reference to the
"Stanford community" in the
ballot proposal. This wording,
however, is taken directly from
the University's "Regulations
Regarding Voluntary
Organizations!" It is explained
there that members of the
Stanford community are
"Stanford students, faculty and
staff members, and their
immediate families."
In addition, we have also been

asked whether safeguards exist
which prevent the discriminatory
use of the funds and services of
the ASSU Attorney. Detailed
proposals for the selection and
operations of the ASSU Attorney
were originally submitted to the
ASSU in March, 1970 (fourteen
months ago). This plan was drawn
up by a Stanford Law School
graduate who practices in the Bay
Area, and the proposal has always
been available for inspection.
The plan provides for a
selection committee to choose the
ASSU Attorney, and describes
working conditions and priorities
for the Attorney. There is an
explicit clause which prevents the
Attorney from taking sides in a
battle which is only between two
students; and of course Bar
Association canons will govern the
propriety of his actions.
It is unfortunate that the Daily
did not seek the answers to their
editorial questions before reaching
a conclusion on the desirability of
our program.
We also note the unsigned
attacks appearing on campus that
are attempting to defeat this

measure by channelling discussion
of the proposal away from its
merits and into a series of
malicious personal attacks.
It is our conviction that the
ASSU Attorney proposal,
submitted by Legal Offense, will
benefit all of Stanford. Hopefully
the irrelevant rhetoric and scare
tactics of our faceless opposition
will not obscure the genuine merit
of the proposal.

"Stanford community" in the
ballot proposal. This wording,
however, is taken directly from
the University's "Regulations
Regarding Voluntary
Organizations!" It is explained
there that members of the
Stanford community are
"Stanford students, faculty and
staff members, and their
immediate families."
In addition, we have also been

asked whether safeguards exist
which prevent the discriminatory
use of the funds and services of
the ASSU Attorney. Detailed
proposals for the selection and
operations of the ASSU Attorney
were originally submitted to the
ASSU in March, 1970 (fourteen
months ago). This plan was drawn
up by a Stanford Law School
graduate who practices in the Bay
Area, and the proposal has always
been available for inspection.
The plan provides for a
selection committee to choose the
ASSU Attorney, and describes
working conditions and priorities
for the Attorney. There is an
explicit clause which prevents the
Attorney from taking sides in a
battle which is only between two
students; and of course Bar
Association canons will govern the
propriety of his actions.
It is unfortunate that the Daily
did not seek the answers to their
editorial questions before reaching
a conclusion on the desirability of
our program.
We also note the unsigned
attacks appearing on campus that
are attempting to defeat this

measure by channelling discussion
of the proposal away from its
merits and into a series of
malicious personal attacks.
It is our conviction that the
ASSU Attorney proposal,
submitted by Legal Offense, will
benefit all of Stanford. Hopefully
the irrelevant rhetoric and scare
tactics of our faceless opposition
will not obscure the genuine merit
of the proposal.

Why has there been so little
publicity in support of the Legal
Offense ballot proposal?
To us the answer seems clear:
the idea of providing paid legal
services to students, through the
ASSU, has obvious merit. In this
area, students (especially foreign
Students) have been illegally
discriminated against in
attempting to find housing;
landlords have illegally withheld
"cleaning" deposits; students have
been taken to small claims court
Without understanding their rights
or have been confronted with
Confusing legal documents loaded
with small print which only a
lawyer could understand; and
dormitory residents increasingly
fear illegal search and seizure.
For the last several years many
individuals have attempted, in a
rather scattered manner, to aid
students with their legal problems.
Finally, Legal Offense, working in
conjunction with local lawyers,
has developed a comprehensive
plan to provide members of the
Stanford community with legal
advice on matters large and small.
Who are these people? Legal
Offense is an organization that has
been incorporated under the

ASSU in a manner similar to the
International Association, the
BSU, and The Company (the
undergraduate dramatic
association). Prior to the
incorporation last December, a
Constitution was filed with the
ASSU Office, and the Dean of
Students Office was notified that
the organization existed.
Legal Offense has undertaken
various activities. At the beginning
of this quarter, the organization
sponsored Jane Fonda's speech
about GI rights and the Peoples'
Peace Treaty. Other work has
involved the development of a
proposal for an ASSU Attorney.
Yesterday, the Daily and
others questioned a possible
vagueness in our reference to the
"Stanford community" in the
ballot proposal. This wording,
however, is taken directly from
the University's "Regulations
