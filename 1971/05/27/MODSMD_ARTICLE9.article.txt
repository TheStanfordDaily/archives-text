Not a few foreign visitors to our hospital have
commented on the democracy which is apparent
even on a brief visit. 1 have worked in the hospital
ever since it was built in 1956 and I have
encountered a deep-going democracy such as I have
not met elsewhere.
Doctors, nurses, orderlies, boiler-men,
administrators, Party functionaries, maintenance
workers, and gardeners, nearly 900 of us, all here
together in one huge dining-room. We collect our
own food and pay for it in food tickets bought once
a month. My lunch, on an average, costs the
equivalent of about sixpence. We all belong to the
same Trade Union, and fee for which is one percent
of the salary. No one does any private practice and
everybody knows what everyone else earns. . .
The actual level of wages and salaries in China, if
translated into English currency, is low; but in my
experience, very few Chinese regard themselves as
being poor. In fact, they are not poor.
Plain Living
They do not have much money but it is enough
tor their needs, with some left over. They pay no
income tax, food and clothing are cheap, rents are
nominal, and frugality and plain living rather than
ostentation are the order of the day.
My experience during 14 years in China is that
the Chinese people have a richer cultural life, are
more articulate, use their leisure time more
profitably, and have a clearer understanding of
where they want to go and how they are going to
get there than any people I have ever met. That
makes them rich, not poor.
I 'hink most of my colleagues in England would
agree that doctors and hospital administrators seem
to be natural enemies.
Committee of Representatives
That is not so in China. All important
administrative decisions are taken on the
recommendation of a committee composed of
elected representatives from every department.

Administrative workers and Party functionaries, in
accordance with regulations in force throughout
China, are expected to spend one day a week doing
such manual work in the hospital as sweeping the
floors, stoking the furnaces, or serving food.
This keeps them in touch with the actual
situation and is a powerful corrective for incipient
bureaucracy. When a hospital director cleans a ward,
he does so under the direction of the ward orderly,
who can form a first-hand estimate of his attitude
and deflate any tendency towards superiority.
Some regard it a waste of time for a skilled
administrator to clean lavatories or shovel coal.
There is, in fact, a contradiction between the
scarcity of trained personnel on the one hand and
the requirement that they spend part of their time
in relatively unskilled labor on the other.
Main Contradiction
The view of the Chinese Communist Party,
however, is that the main contradiction lies not here
but in the tendency for those in positions of
authority to become bureaucrats who issue orders
from their offices without investigating the
problems they are dealing with, and who gradually
put their own interests first.
This tendency is very powerful and, although
exceptional strength of character may resist it,
administrators can easily become bureaucrats unless
they are confronted by a powerful corrective such
as regular participation in manual labor.
The shortage of trained personnel is only
temporary, but the necessity to maintain the closest
links between administrators and Party
functionaries and the mass of the people, and to nip
bureaucracy in the bud, is permanent.
Participation of Administrators
Therefore, no matter that "ten thousand tasks
cry out to be done, and all of them urgently." The
Chinese Communist Party insists on regular
participation of administrators and Party
functionaries in manual labor.
My own experience has been not that too much
time has been spent in this way, but rather too
little, since in the few years preceding the Cultural
Revolution there was a tendency for this excellent
practice to go by the board.
