# Five Workers Dismissed
## 
### PHIL LIND 
Four University employees, who are members of
Venceremos, and a worker at the Hospital were fired
yesterday by Director of Personnel Robert Nelson for their
alleged participation in the April 9 sit-in at the Hospital.
The action takes effect at 5 p.m. today.
The five workers were Anthoney Chatmon and
Venceremos members John Keilch, Devera Satisky, John
Dolly and Barbara Mooney. Notification of the possibility
of this disciplinary action was officially given to the
workers by Nelson on June 2.
Four of the five met with Nelson on June 10. On June
11a class grievance, signed by 35 people, was filed against
Nelson, University President Lyman, Provost Miller, and
Staff Counsel Cullen, charging the University with the
intimidation of workers.
The grievance condemned the sit-in investigation,
contending, "administrators have no right to conduct
inquiries into the lives of employees unrelated to their
work performance. This conspiratorial atiitude and activity

by administrators is a gross intimidation of all Stanford
employees. This shows how far the Administration will go
to prevent workers organizing against institutional racism at
Stanford," commented Venceremos member Kiekh. "Not
content with bringing 3 felonies and 45 middemeanors
against us in court, the Administration isn't even waiting
for the trial to add penalties. They want to purge all of the
most politically active workers now before the NLRB
election is announced in a few weeks."
Four of the five have recently been involved in United
Stanford Employees (USE) organizing for an upcoming
National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election.
"The Administration has placed us in a situation of
double jeopardy by asking us about information which
would prejudice our criminal court case," said Satisky.
"Workers I've spoken with, think this whole mess is really
unjust because the University has, in effect, tried us, before
no jury, and before the courts and jury have ruled on our
innocence or guilt."
Nelson refused to comment on the firings.
