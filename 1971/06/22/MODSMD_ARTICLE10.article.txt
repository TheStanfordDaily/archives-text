## Draft 'Withering' 
### 
bill evers

The passage in the U.S. Senate of
the high military pay package (the
Allott amendment) means that now the
draft is going to wither away, the
efforts of Senators Edward Kennedy
and John Tunney notwithstanding.
Kennedy and Tunney opposed the pay
hike. The final form of the new
military pay increase has yet to emerge
from the House-Senate conference
committee to be voted on in both
houses of Congress. But the Senate has
definitely decided to join the House in
going for a Gates Commission-variety
$2.7 billion increase instead of the
Nixon administration's $1 billion
increase.
The earlier defeat in the Senate of a
high pay package (the
Hughes-Schweiker amendment)
coupled with the later victory of
another high pay package that was in
many ways similar puzzled some
observers. One explanation is that the
forces backing the Allott amendment
included Senators who would like to
see the draft phased out over the course
of two years, whereas those backing the
Hughes-Schweiker amendment were
advocates of repeal or one-year
extension. Another explanation is
simple partisan politics: the
congressional Republicans wanted all
the credit for sponsoring higher pay
and therefore refused to back the
earlier bipartisan effort.
There is one possible disaster to still
watch out for. The war hawks and
Pentagon bervants who will constitute
the conference committee may well try
to alter the pay package so that instead
of major increases in the pay of
first-term enlistees, there would be
increases in colonels' salaries. Should
this happen, the army would remain
unattractive to potential volunteers,
and conscription would remain in
operation.

Also Robert F. Froehlke, a close,
personal friend of Melvin Laird, is to
replace Stanley R. Resor as Secretary
of the Army. Like Resor, Froehlke is
on record as opposing an all-volunteer
armed force and would as head of the
army be in a position to sabotage
moves away from conscription, if he
chose to do so.
In the meantime, a filibuster is being
mounted by anti-draft and anti-war
forces led by Senator Mike Gravel of
Alaska in order to attract public
attention and to reverse the Senate's
approval of two-year extension of the
draft law. But Mike Mansfield, Birch
Bayh, Tunney, and other democratists
who oppose filibusters on principle will
join John Stennis and the militarists in
voting for cloture. Numerically, such a
coalition has a lot of clout.
Another news item worthy of note
is the new fares for scheduled flights to
Europe. The price-fixing cartel of the
International Air Transport Association
has broken down. Apparently under
pressure from the costs of running
unfilled transatlantic trips and from the
increasing popularity of inexpensive
charter flights, several airlines,
including Air Canada and Pan Am, had
decided to institute lower fares. Price
competition began at the beginning of
June when Sabena, the Belgian airline,
offered a cut-rate youth fare to Europe.
Now several airlines propose to carry
travellers of any age between New York
and London on scheduled flights for as
little as $100 each way, starting next
spring, (Current peak-time, one-way
New York-to-London fare is $276. This
is the cartel fixed price.)
The best youth fare price now in
miles per dollar has come from Italy's
Alitalia ($199 round-trip, New York or
Philadelphia or Boston to Rome or
Milan). However, lest competition

break out, the Civil Aeronautics Board,
the enforcement agency of the
domestic airline industry cartel, has
instituted legal proceedings against
Alitalia for its low fares.
This is not Ripley's Believe It or
Not. This is simply another
confirmation of historian Gabriel
Kolko's thesis that the regulatory
agencies were devised by and for big
business. In 1938, the C.A.B. was
formed in response to the desires of the
airline industry. Since then, it has
functioned so as to restrict entry and
discourage price competition. As an
example of the C.A.B.'s work, over the
years, the C.A.B. has received over 150
applications for the establishment of
new scheduled airline companies. It has
denied every single application and thus
propected the markets held by the
already established firms. It now;
apparently intends to work to
reconstruct the international
price-fixing cartel.

There is one possible disaster to still
watch out for. The war hawks and
Pentagon bervants who will constitute
the conference committee may well try
to alter the pay package so that instead
of major increases in the pay of
first-term enlistees, there would be
increases in colonels' salaries. Should
this happen, the army would remain
unattractive to potential volunteers,
and conscription would remain in
operation.

Also Robert F. Froehlke, a close,
personal friend of Melvin Laird, is to
replace Stanley R. Resor as Secretary
of the Army. Like Resor, Froehlke is
on record as opposing an all-volunteer
armed force and would as head of the
army be in a position to sabotage
moves away from conscription, if he
chose to do so.
In the meantime, a filibuster is being
mounted by anti-draft and anti-war
forces led by Senator Mike Gravel of
Alaska in order to attract public
attention and to reverse the Senate's
approval of two-year extension of the
draft law. But Mike Mansfield, Birch
Bayh, Tunney, and other democratists
who oppose filibusters on principle will
join John Stennis and the militarists in
voting for cloture. Numerically, such a
coalition has a lot of clout.
Another news item worthy of note
is the new fares for scheduled flights to
Europe. The price-fixing cartel of the
International Air Transport Association
has broken down. Apparently under
pressure from the costs of running
unfilled transatlantic trips and from the
increasing popularity of inexpensive
charter flights, several airlines,
including Air Canada and Pan Am, had
decided to institute lower fares. Price
competition began at the beginning of
June when Sabena, the Belgian airline,
offered a cut-rate youth fare to Europe.
Now several airlines propose to carry
travellers of any age between New York
and London on scheduled flights for as
little as $100 each way, starting next
spring, (Current peak-time, one-way
New York-to-London fare is $276. This
is the cartel fixed price.)
The best youth fare price now in
miles per dollar has come from Italy's
Alitalia ($199 round-trip, New York or
Philadelphia or Boston to Rome or
Milan). However, lest competition

break out, the Civil Aeronautics Board,
the enforcement agency of the
domestic airline industry cartel, has
instituted legal proceedings against
Alitalia for its low fares.
This is not Ripley's Believe It or
Not. This is simply another
confirmation of historian Gabriel
Kolko's thesis that the regulatory
agencies were devised by and for big
business. In 1938, the C.A.B. was
formed in response to the desires of the
airline industry. Since then, it has
functioned so as to restrict entry and
discourage price competition. As an
example of the C.A.B.'s work, over the
years, the C.A.B. has received over 150
applications for the establishment of
new scheduled airline companies. It has
denied every single application and thus
propected the markets held by the
already established firms. It now;
apparently intends to work to
reconstruct the international
price-fixing cartel.

The passage in the U.S. Senate of
the high military pay package (the
Allott amendment) means that now the
draft is going to wither away, the
efforts of Senators Edward Kennedy
and John Tunney notwithstanding.
Kennedy and Tunney opposed the pay
hike. The final form of the new
military pay increase has yet to emerge
from the House-Senate conference
committee to be voted on in both
houses of Congress. But the Senate has
definitely decided to join the House in
going for a Gates Commission-variety
$2.7 billion increase instead of the
Nixon administration's $1 billion
increase.
The earlier defeat in the Senate of a
high pay package (the
Hughes-Schweiker amendment)
coupled with the later victory of
another high pay package that was in
many ways similar puzzled some
observers. One explanation is that the
forces backing the Allott amendment
included Senators who would like to
see the draft phased out over the course
of two years, whereas those backing the
Hughes-Schweiker amendment were
advocates of repeal or one-year
extension. Another explanation is
simple partisan politics: the
congressional Republicans wanted all
the credit for sponsoring higher pay
and therefore refused to back the
earlier bipartisan effort.
