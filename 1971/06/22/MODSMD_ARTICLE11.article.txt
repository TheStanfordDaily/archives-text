# Trials Continue Into Summer
## 
### 
Separate trials are continuing
this summer for Leo Bazile and
Christopher Laury, the Stanford
Daily, and 33 persons accused in
connection with the hospital
sit-in.
In a preliminary hearing
Friday, Bazile and Laury were
accused of beating and burning
Stanford Medical Center
supervisor Mary Jane Schmitt.
Schmitt, however, was unable to
identify Laury in the Redwood
City courtroom although she was
standing less than two feet from
him.
Laury and Bazile were sitting
in the audience which included
only four black males. When
asked to identify her two
attackers Schmitt first pointed to
Bazile and then mistakenly
pointed to Keith King, a friend of
Laury's sitting next to him, when
trying to identify Laury.

Later Schmitt correctly
identified Laury from a picture
printed April 29 in the Stanford
Daily. Municiple Court Judge
Frank Piombo had to have the
picture cut apart to remove
arrows and a cutline which
pointed out Laury in the picture.
Judge Piombo commented that
the prosecution had presented a
"weak" case, but that it appeared
that a crime had been committed
and a trial should be held. At the
urging of attorney R. Jay Engel,
Judge Piombo agreed to delay
making his decision—either that
they stand trial or that the charges
should be dismissed—until
tomorrow.
According to Bazile's attorney,
Thelton Henderson of the
Stanford Law School, "(Schmitt's
identification) appears to be a
case of blacks looking alike to a
white."

The case has attracted
considerable attention because a
number of prominent university
and civic officials have formed a
committee in support of Bazile
and declared publicly that they
believe him innocent. The
committee includes President
Richard Lyman and Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey (R-Calif.).
In the lawsuit of the Stanford
Daily against the Palo Alto Police,
San Jose federal judge Robert F.
Peckham has scheduled a hearing
for Sept. 12. The Daily has
charged the police with illegally
searching the newspaper office,
and has asked for injunctive relief
to prevent another raid in the
future.
The search brought
denunciation from newspaper
editors across the country and
condemnation from numerous

journalism groups, both local and
national.
The Daily is being defended by
Anthony Amsterday, noted civil
rights defender and defense
counsel for New York Times
reporter Earl Caldwell, recently
upheld for refusing a federal
subpoena for his notes on Black
Panther activity.
The trials of 33 persons
arrested following a violent
confrontation in the Stanford
Hospital will begin early next
month. Charges range from assault
with a deadly weapon, a felony,
to trespass, a misdemeanor. The
defendants will be tried in four
groups, one consisting of those
charged with felonies and three of
those charged with misdemeanors.
The first trial will take place July
6, at 9 a.m. in the North Country
Courthouse.

to prevent another raid in the
future.
The search brought
denunciation from newspaper
editors across the country and
condemnation from numerous

journalism groups, both local and
national.
The Daily is being defended by
Anthony Amsterday, noted civil
rights defender and defense
counsel for New York Times
reporter Earl Caldwell, recently
upheld for refusing a federal
subpoena for his notes on Black
Panther activity.
The trials of 33 persons
arrested following a violent
confrontation in the Stanford
Hospital will begin early next
month. Charges range from assault
with a deadly weapon, a felony,
to trespass, a misdemeanor. The
defendants will be tried in four
groups, one consisting of those
charged with felonies and three of
those charged with misdemeanors.
The first trial will take place July
6, at 9 a.m. in the North Country
Courthouse.
Separate trials are continuing
this summer for Leo Bazile and
Christopher Laury, the Stanford
Daily, and 33 persons accused in
connection with the hospital
sit-in.
In a preliminary hearing
Friday, Bazile and Laury were
accused of beating and burning
Stanford Medical Center
supervisor Mary Jane Schmitt.
Schmitt, however, was unable to
identify Laury in the Redwood
City courtroom although she was
standing less than two feet from
him.
Laury and Bazile were sitting
in the audience which included
only four black males. When
asked to identify her two
attackers Schmitt first pointed to
Bazile and then mistakenly
pointed to Keith King, a friend of
Laury's sitting next to him, when
trying to identify Laury.

Later Schmitt correctly
identified Laury from a picture
printed April 29 in the Stanford
Daily. Municiple Court Judge
Frank Piombo had to have the
picture cut apart to remove
arrows and a cutline which
pointed out Laury in the picture.
Judge Piombo commented that
the prosecution had presented a
"weak" case, but that it appeared
that a crime had been committed
and a trial should be held. At the
urging of attorney R. Jay Engel,
Judge Piombo agreed to delay
making his decision—either that
they stand trial or that the charges
should be dismissed—until
tomorrow.
According to Bazile's attorney,
Thelton Henderson of the
Stanford Law School, "(Schmitt's
identification) appears to be a
case of blacks looking alike to a
white."

The case has attracted
considerable attention because a
number of prominent university
and civic officials have formed a
committee in support of Bazile
and declared publicly that they
believe him innocent. The
committee includes President
Richard Lyman and Rep. Paul N.
McCloskey (R-Calif.).
In the lawsuit of the Stanford
Daily against the Palo Alto Police,
San Jose federal judge Robert F.
Peckham has scheduled a hearing
for Sept. 12. The Daily has
charged the police with illegally
searching the newspaper office,
and has asked for injunctive relief
to prevent another raid in the
future.
