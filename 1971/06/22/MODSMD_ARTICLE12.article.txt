# Plans For Housing Project Under Committee Scrutiny

### RICHARD KOKEN 
Plans for a low-middle income housing project on
Stanford Land are taking shape. A proposal by the
Stanford Mid-Peninsula Urban Coalition calls for
225 units on twenty acres of Stanford land at Page
Mill Road and Peter Coutts Road. Barbara Kline of
the Coalition says that construction may begin by
November 1972.
The proposal is presently under consideration by
University officers and committees. Most of the
discussion is currently centered in a subcommittee
on housing which is headed by Prof. Robert Walker.
Walker is careful to stress that "Nothing is certain,"
while noting that negotiations with the Coalition
have encountered no major difficulties.
Although Wlaker's subcommittee is composed of
only faculty and staff homeowners, it can also serve
as a vehicle through which nonmember residents
near the proposed building site can express their
concerns.
Findings from Walker's subcommittee will be
referred to the University Committee on Land
Development, headed by Professor David Mason.
Mason hopes that the committee work will

"proceed with all dispatch" this summer so that
recommendations can be acted upon by President
Lyman and then by the Trustees.
The project's design by San Francisco architects
Hardison and Komatsu, is an important point of
discussion. At a public presentation on June 8,
James Culpepper, a writer living in College Terrace,
called the project a "horrendous atrocity" and said
that the area should be left as open space. In
attempting to satisfy this desire for open sapce,
both ol future residents and nearby homeowners,
the architects plan to leave the crowns of hills open
by using a loop private street pattern.
Another point of consideration is the number of
units to be constructed on the twenty acres. Barbara
Kline of the Coalition feels that with the
recommended 225 units it will be possible to
operate a day care center and possibly a local store.
Kline says that with fewer units, the operation of
these conveniences will become less feasible.
The development will be covered by Section 236
of the National Housing Act, and federal subsidies
will allow rent to be adjusted on a sliding scale so
that payments constitute about one fourth of a
family's income.
