# 4,000 Graduates Saluted
## 
### David Elkind 
A year of sporatic terrorism
and student political apathy
ended with peaceful
commencement exercises over the
weekend of June 12-13. The most
conspicuous break with tradition
was the awarding of more than
4,000 degrees at 10 separate,
simultaneous ceremonies.
In a slight reminder of the
ceremonies a year before, 200
graduate students from
"Graduates Dis-Robe for Peace"
marched in the procession Sunday
without robes, donating their
rental money instead to several
anti-war groups.
Otherwise, the only mention of
activism and its effects came from
CBS-TV commentator Eric
Sevareid, who gave the key-note
address and President Richard W.
Lyman, speaking on the changing
Stanford scene.
Calling for a combination of
youthful idealism and experience,
Sevareid criticized the notion that
the middle class was "apathetic"
and warned against idealism
carried to violence. He spoke
before an audience of about
10,000 in Frost Amphitheater.
"The intellectual is the natural
creator and dissenter," he said.
"But to the extent that he fosters,
not dissent itself, but violent
dissent, I fear for him and his
status."
Quoting Alfred North
Whitehead, Sevareid warned, "Wait
for the back streets. When they
move, the intellectuals are swept
aside."
"That can happen here," he
said.
Delivering his first
commencement address, President
Lyman explained that "ihe
campus is hardly cloistered" any
longer. "If it resembles a

monestary at all, the model might
seem to be Monte Casino under
the siege in World War II."
Asking the seniors "to wait a
while before reaching any final
conclusion as to whether your
Stanford years were time well
spent," President Lyman noted
that "the phenomenon of the
college graduate who becomes a
house-painter or a taxi driver or a
carpenter, or even a more or less
permanent beach-comber, is not
wholly attributable to the
economic condition of the
country."
"It is partly one more sign—if
any were needed—that all is not
well with higher education
today," ne said.
President Lyman also
presented the first four Walter J.
Gores awards for excellence in
teaching to winners selected by
nominations from students and
faculty.
Receiving the $1,000 checks
were John J. Gurley, professor of
economics; Jerry A. Irish,
assistant professor of Religion;
James F. Dice Jr. of Santa Cruz,
graduate student and teaching
assistant in Human Biology; and
Louis Padulo, visiting associate
professor of Electorial
Engineering from Morehouse

College, Atlanta.
President Lyman presented a
$3,500 Dinkelspiel Award to
Philosophy Professor John
Goheen, while seniors Margaret
Wolf Freivogel and William H.
Durham won $350 Dinkelspiel
Awards for outstanding
contributions to undergraduate
education.
Goheen, former head of the
Philosophy Department, helped
formulate plans for what later
became Stanford's first Asian
study center at Waseda, Japan
while a visiting professor at the
University of Tokyo in the early
19505.
Freivogel, former editor of The
Stanford Daily and Phi Beta
Kappa member, was honored by
President Lyman for "honest
reporting in hard times" and
"high concern for academic
excellence in her service with the
trustee's committee on Academic
Affairs and the committee for the
selection of the provost."
Dirham, a Human Biology
major, was cited for his initiation
and leadership of the
student-direct Bay Area air
pollution study, his participation
in the Overseas Campus program,
the student residence program and
athletics.

VOTER REGISTRATION- A day-long push to register new voters was held yesterday with excellent
results. Over three hundred students registered and another two hundred students from out of state took
blank form letters which will enable them to register in their home states. A breakdown of the count
reflected the political affiliations of the new voters: Democratic 62%, Republican 18%, Independent
15%, Peace and Freedom 4%, all others 1%, At the request of Stanford President Richard Lyman,
optional voter registration for new students may soon become a regular part of registration into
Stanford.

"It is partly one more sign—if
any were needed—that all is not

today," ne said.
President Lyman also
presented the first four Walter J.
Gores awards for excellence in
teaching to winners selected by
nominations from students and
faculty.
Receiving the $1,000 checks
were John J. Gurley, professor of
economics; Jerry A. Irish,
assistant professor of Religion;
James F. Dice Jr. of Santa Cruz,
graduate student and teaching
assistant in Human Biology; and
Louis Padulo, visiting associate
professor of Electorial
Engineering from Morehouse

College, Atlanta.
President Lyman presented a
$3,500 Dinkelspiel Award to
Philosophy Professor John
Goheen, while seniors Margaret
Wolf Freivogel and William H.
Durham won $350 Dinkelspiel
Awards for outstanding
contributions to undergraduate
education.
Goheen, former head of the
Philosophy Department, helped
formulate plans for what later
became Stanford's first Asian
study center at Waseda, Japan
while a visiting professor at the
University of Tokyo in the early
19505.
Freivogel, former editor of The
Stanford Daily and Phi Beta
Kappa member, was honored by
President Lyman for "honest
reporting in hard times" and
"high concern for academic
excellence in her service with the
trustee's committee on Academic
Affairs and the committee for the
selection of the provost."
Dirham, a Human Biology
major, was cited for his initiation
and leadership of the
student-direct Bay Area air
pollution study, his participation
in the Overseas Campus program,
the student residence program and
athletics.

VOTER REGISTRATION- A day-long push to register new voters was held yesterday with excellent
results. Over three hundred students registered and another two hundred students from out of state took
blank form letters which will enable them to register in their home states. A breakdown of the count
reflected the political affiliations of the new voters: Democratic 62%, Republican 18%, Independent
15%, Peace and Freedom 4%, all others 1%, At the request of Stanford President Richard Lyman,
optional voter registration for new students may soon become a regular part of registration into
Stanford.
A year of sporatic terrorism
and student political apathy
ended with peaceful
commencement exercises over the
weekend of June 12-13. The most
conspicuous break with tradition
was the awarding of more than
4,000 degrees at 10 separate,
simultaneous ceremonies.
In a slight reminder of the
ceremonies a year before, 200
graduate students from
"Graduates Dis-Robe for Peace"
marched in the procession Sunday
without robes, donating their
rental money instead to several
anti-war groups.
Otherwise, the only mention of
activism and its effects came from
CBS-TV commentator Eric
Sevareid, who gave the key-note
address and President Richard W.
Lyman, speaking on the changing
Stanford scene.
Calling for a combination of
youthful idealism and experience,
Sevareid criticized the notion that
the middle class was "apathetic"
and warned against idealism
carried to violence. He spoke
before an audience of about
10,000 in Frost Amphitheater.
"The intellectual is the natural
creator and dissenter," he said.
"But to the extent that he fosters,
not dissent itself, but violent
dissent, I fear for him and his
status."
Quoting Alfred North
Whitehead, Sevareid warned, "Wait
for the back streets. When they
move, the intellectuals are swept
aside."
"That can happen here," he
said.
Delivering his first
commencement address, President
Lyman explained that "ihe
campus is hardly cloistered" any
longer. "If it resembles a

monestary at all, the model might
seem to be Monte Casino under
the siege in World War II."
Asking the seniors "to wait a
while before reaching any final
conclusion as to whether your
Stanford years were time well
spent," President Lyman noted
that "the phenomenon of the
college graduate who becomes a
house-painter or a taxi driver or a
carpenter, or even a more or less
permanent beach-comber, is not
wholly attributable to the
economic condition of the
country."
"It is partly one more sign—if
any were needed—that all is not
well with higher education
