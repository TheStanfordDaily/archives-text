# Ecology Musical
## Save 'Mother Earth'! 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The new ecology musical
"Mother Earth" opened its San
Francisco engagement Saturday
night before a full house at the
Marines Memorial Theatre, and it
was easy to to see while it has
been sold out for many weeks in
Los Angeles.
In the past few months almost
everyone has jumped on the
ecological bandwagon and it was
only a matter of time before a
big-time musical latched onto the
movement for its theme.
Fortunately, the people behind
what is probably the first major
ecological stage performance have
avoided quick commerical
gimmickery and have created a
play which is hard-hitting and
incredibly serious while at the
same time is humorous and
entertaining.
Writer-lyricist Ron Thronson
and composer-musical director
Toni Shearer have written a
musical which compares favorably
with many of the other social
relevance productions saturating
today's stage. They have avoided
the trap of boring and depressing
an audience by trying to tell them
over and over again, without any
let-up, what terrible shape our
society is in.
Tempered Seriousness
The ten member cast, which
includes Shearer, carries out the
musical theme well—they temper
the seriousness of their efforts
with well-done comedy and
old-style musical entertainment,
including dancing and plain old
fun.
But even the comic moments
have their heavy message. Some of
the funniest of the more than 50
scenes which comprise the show
are ones which take serious,
satirical looks at two of our major
ecological problems-those of
overpopulation and of air
pollution. Some of the better skits
include those of a gas mask
fashion show, population police
arresting lovers and a breathe-out,
in which two duelers breathe

until one dies in western
shoot-out style.
"Mother Earth" also takes
pokes at some of the commercial
hypocrisy surrounding
environmental concern.
Particularly good is a scene
satirizing the infamous Standard
Oil F-310 advertisement featuring
a bumbling "Astronaut Scott
Armstrong."
Two of the most hard-hitting
of the scenes in the show look at
the frightening extreme to which
pollution and environmental
destruction could carry our
"mother earth."
Kill-a-Thon
One was a "Kill-a-Thon," in
which radio listeners could "call a
toll-free number and pledge their
lives to saving our planet. A
typical fast-talking, full-of-hype
disc jockey described for the
audience how each person went
and how every donor had his
choice of suicide method."
Then there was a scene in
which the final human being
turned his artificial insemnination
laboratory over to one of his
test-tube born assistants. This
scene as well as another in which
there is a robot whore house with
wind-up prostitutes, took shots at
society's depersonalization of sex.
High Level Acting
But throughout the show, the
actors maintain a high level of
entertaining performance. The
musical numbers give almost
everyone a good chance to display
their singing abilities and there are
few problems. Peter Jason, who
has appeared in previous ACT
productions, has a magnificent
deep voice and is an accomplished
television actor.
Carol Kristy is a spunky little
dynamo who is particularly good
as a robot whore and as a plastic
redwood tree in a scene in which
the last two natural redwood trees
are cut down. Jennifer Lee is a
veteran of numerous major
musicals who is easily
recognizable from her numerous
appearances in television

commercials.
The very-tall, blond Shearer is
the hardest-working cast member
as she moves back and forth from
the stage to the piano. Her piano
is featured on most of the songs,
as the rest of the "rock band"
(organ, drums and two barely
noticeable electric guitars) pretty
much stays in the background.
Not Perfect
The show, of course, is not
without its flaws. A screen which
shows slides reinforcing the
message of each scene is highly
aesthetic and effective at times,
but its presence makes one at
times wonder if the performers
would be able to always get across
their message as clearly without
its help.
The first act is a bit hard to get
into, mainly because some of the
scenes, especially the musical
numbers, are a bit too short and
abrupt.
But after the intermission
everything seems to get rolling
and some of the straight musical
numbers in Act II are truly
beautiful and moving, especially
"Good Morning World", "Nappy
Mother's Day"and "Xanadu".
The show ends with reprises of
"Xanadu" and the lovely "Sail
On, Sweet Universe," followed by
a predictable standing ovation.
Affecting Message
Hopefully the enthusiastic
audience was not only applauding
the fine talent of Shearer
and Thronson and director Ray
Golen, but were also showing
their support for the show's
message. Hopefully they were as
affected as I was and took some
increased environmental concern
home with them.
For as the show's musical
refrain warns:
I 'Humanity is my name
Mother Earth is my nation
Procreation is my game
Death, my destination."
The show will continue on
Tuesdays through Fridays at 8:30,
Saturday at 7:00 and 10:00 and
Sunday at 3:00 and 7:00. Prices
range from $3.50 (Sunday
afternoon rear balcony) to $7.50
(Saturday night orchestra).
Student rush tickets are
$2.50-$3.50, but their availability
may be small due to the fact that
"Mother Earth" will probably be
playing to large houses for quite
awhile.

scene from the new ecology musical "Mother Earth." After a long successful run in Los Angeles, the
musical made its San Francisco debut on Saturday night at the Marines Memorial Theatre.
