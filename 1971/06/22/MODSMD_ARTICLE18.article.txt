# Tolly's Follies

### Don Tollefson 
Editor's Note—This is the first in a series of weekly
and sometimes bi-weekly columns which will try to
keep people informed about events happening in the
local entertainment world. Most attention will be
given to on-campus events and to attractions in the
local community. Events of special importance or
interest elsewhere in the Bay Area will also be men
tioned when space permits. Keeping in mind the
fact that our audience will be made up mainly of
budget-conscious college students and community
people, the column will try to focus on the less
expensive entertainment values. Prices of activities
will be given whenever possible. Special attention
will also be given to little-known local clubs, play
houses, restaurants. . . . Due to our small staff, any
information from readers about especially, unusual
and little-known entertainment activities will be
welcomed and should be sent to Don Tollefson, c/o
The Daily.
The Stanford Summer Festival which brought
outstanding cultural events to the campus up until
last summer is no more, but there will still be a
number of outstanding on-campus events this
quarter. Two of the highlights later in the summer
will be appearances by the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band from July 13-17 and by the comedy team of
Bob and Ray from July 20-25.
But the quarter will get off to a quick start this
week. The highlight of this week will probably be
the opening of Michael Mclure's highly-controversial
play "The Beard," which will open a 15
performance run at the Little Theater Wednesday
at 8:00 p.m.
"The Beard" has been involved in numerous legal
battles over its subject matter since its premiere in
1965. It has been called a "milestone in the history
of heterosexual art." Performances will continue on
June 25, 26, 30 and July 1-3,8-10 and 14-17,24,25,
26 & 30. Tickets will be available at the door for $2.
Musically, the first two concerts in the
Department of Music's free summer concert season
will be this Friday and Saturday. On Friday night,
Martha Blackman, codirector of the Summer
Workshop in Baroque and Pre-Baroque Music and a

former member of the New Vork Pro Musica, will
give a recital of music for viola da gamba.
On Saturday night, Stanley Buetens, director of
the Stanford Lute Workshop, will be featured in a
concert of lute music. Both concerts will be at 8:00
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
At least three art exhibits continue on-campus
this week. "A Decade in The West" exhibit
featuring 55 works by contemporary West Coast
artists will be on display at the Stanford Museum,
through August 22.
In the Miedel Room at the Stanford Museum.
82 historical propoganda posters are featured in a
"War, Revolution and Peace" exhibit which will last
through mid-August. And 77 portrait prints by
Anthony Vandyke highlight the "Faces of the 17 th
Century" exhibit which will be on display in the
Albert M. Bender Room in the Main Library until
August 15.
And the old standby of campus
entertainment—the movie—will not be missing this
week. The first two films in the Second Annual
Science Fiction and Fantasy summer film series will
be shown today and Thursday.
Today at 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. in Cubberly
Auditorium, Jane Fonda can be seen in Barbarella.
At the same times on Thursday, the original
Frankenstein will be screened. Both films will be
preceded by episodes from the original Buck Rogers
serial, as will all but one of the 14 films to be
shown.
Series tickets are $9 for the afternoon series and
$10 for the evening series. Single admissions at 80
cents in the afternoon and $1.00 at night will go on
sale at the door one half-hour before showtime.
Season tickets can be purchased at the Tresidder
ticket office.
On Sunday night Beta Chi Films will present "Z"
in Memorial Auditorium for $1 per person. And
next Monday the Humphrey Bogart classic
"Casablanca" will be shown in Cubberly
Auditorium at 7:30 and 9:30. Tickets will be $1 for
this and all other films in the Philosophical Films
Series.

Century" exhibit which will be on display in the
Albert M. Bender Room in the Main Library until

And the old standby of campus
entertainment—the movie—will not be missing this
week. The first two films in the Second Annual
Science Fiction and Fantasy summer film series will
be shown today and Thursday.
Today at 4 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. in Cubberly
Auditorium, Jane Fonda can be seen in Barbarella.

$10 for the evening series. Single admissions at 80
cents in the afternoon and $1.00 at night will go on
sale at the door one half-hour before showtime.

Editor's Note—This is the first in a series of weekly
and sometimes bi-weekly columns which will try to
keep people informed about events happening in the
local entertainment world. Most attention will be
given to on-campus events and to attractions in the
local community. Events of special importance or
interest elsewhere in the Bay Area will also be men
tioned when space permits. Keeping in mind the
fact that our audience will be made up mainly of
budget-conscious college students and community
people, the column will try to focus on the less
expensive entertainment values. Prices of activities
will be given whenever possible. Special attention
will also be given to little-known local clubs, play
houses, restaurants. . . . Due to our small staff, any
information from readers about especially, unusual
and little-known entertainment activities will be
welcomed and should be sent to Don Tollefson, c/o
The Daily.
The Stanford Summer Festival which brought
outstanding cultural events to the campus up until
last summer is no more, but there will still be a
number of outstanding on-campus events this
quarter. Two of the highlights later in the summer
will be appearances by the Preservation Hall Jazz
Band from July 13-17 and by the comedy team of
Bob and Ray from July 20-25.
But the quarter will get off to a quick start this
week. The highlight of this week will probably be
the opening of Michael Mclure's highly-controversial
play "The Beard," which will open a 15
performance run at the Little Theater Wednesday
at 8:00 p.m.
"The Beard" has been involved in numerous legal
battles over its subject matter since its premiere in
1965. It has been called a "milestone in the history
of heterosexual art." Performances will continue on
June 25, 26, 30 and July 1-3,8-10 and 14-17,24,25,
26 & 30. Tickets will be available at the door for $2.
