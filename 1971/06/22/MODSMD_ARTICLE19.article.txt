# 'Tinkle' In The Pews
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Fake Theater, a new San
Francisco acting ensemble, has
opened its first production, a
comedy by N. F. Simpson called
"A Resounding Tinkle."
The story (and I use this word
advisedly) concerns an evening in
the home of a lower-middle-class
couple, presumably in
contemporary London. They have
just acquired an elephant (part of
some annual tradition) and
squabble about what to name it.
They finally decide to trade it for
a neighbor's snake. The evening is
interupted by the arrival of Uncle
Ted, a buxom, bra-less
wench-Uncle Ted, on a whim, has
changed his sex. And it goes on
and on.
Mr. Simpson is obviously an
admirer of lonesco. One gets the
impression that he ate a copy of
"The Bald Soprano" before
writting this little venture into the
absurd. It would not be fair to say
that it is an imitation, but the
resemblance is so strong that one
must wonder.
Sporadic Humor
The play is sporadically very
funny. Some of the non sequiturs
and absurdities strike a hidden
chord buried in my id, and I
laugh. But most of the time it is
strained humor. In addition, I
often get the uncomfortable
feeling that the whole thing is an
allegory, but for the life of me, I
can't figure out what it is trying
to say; this makes me nervous.
The cast of three varies from

so-so to very good. Both Thom
Phillips as Bro and Rhodam Gross
as his wife Middie are all right
most of the time, with occassional
flashes of comic insight.
Judy Wyle, in her sleeveless
shirt and horrible red hart is a
very funny Uncle Ted. Miss Wyle
is a fine comedienne, and gives
quite a bit of support to the
show's sagging midsection.
Heavy Odds
The play was directed by
Michelle Truffaut. Miss Truffaut
was working against considerable
odds: a far from perfect script, an
apparently inexperienced cast,
and a theater that is hard to
believe. All things considered, she
did a rather good job of it,
keeping the actors moving, and
showing a bit of cleverness here
and there.

The theater, for those of you
who like adventure, is in the
basement of the St. Paulus
Lutheran Church, at 950 Gough
Street. This is one block from the
freeway entrance; which may be
convenient, as the neighborhood
is a bit seedy, and you might feel
the need to make a fast getaway.
If you're lucky, as I was the
night I saw it, you might catch a
bit of organ practice; Bach has a
tendency to filter through the
walls, providing a pleasant
backdrop for the players.
There is no admission price,
but a one dollar donation is
strongly requested. The play will
show this Friday and Saturday at
8:30 p.m. It runs less than an
hour, and if you're in town you
might want to give it a try.
