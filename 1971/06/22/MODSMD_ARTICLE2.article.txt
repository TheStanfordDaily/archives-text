# Summer Sunshine Sells Stanford; Student Studies Sometimes Suffer
## 
### LARRY JOE Commentary 
Summer at Stanford: fewer people, a
slower pace, more sunshine, visitors
from the East Coast.
No one is sure just what makes the
biggest difference, but it's certain this
place has a new atmosphere from
mid-June to mid-August.
The summer student body shrinks by
almost two-thirds, as a walk through
Quad between classes makes clear.
Compare 4,000 summer students
actively taking undergraduate and
graduate courses to 11,000 in the fall
(figures based on last year's
enrollment).
Summer session director Sally
Mahoney believes the lower population
makes summer "more relaxed. Because
of the smaller numbers, there is a kind
of ease of meeting people and a general
friendliness."

There certainly are enough new
people to meet. The more than 2,000
regular Stanford graduate students who
toil through summer courses are joined
by almost 700 visitors. The percentage
of "foreigners" is even higher among
undergrads. Regular Stanford
undergrads out-register visitors from
other academic worlds by only 900 to
600.
Many of the visitors are
undergraduates from other schools
checking out Stanford as a graduate
school possibility, according to
Mahoney.
Forty or more of next year's high
school seniors are given a controlled
taste of college life during summer.
They are allowed to enroll only in
certain courses, mostly introductory.
The high schoolers will be concentrated
in Lagunita's Adelpha dorm— "where
they can support one another when
they don't know what's going on,"
according to a residence official.

A majority of the summer visitors on
all levels are women. Among graduate
students, men still outnumber women
by four to one. But among
undergraduates the Stanford
male-female ratio at iast reaches 1:1
during the summer.
Resident male chauvinists insist
summer session includes a greater
number of better-looking women than
the regular Stanford selection. An
amateur social critic said the
combination of sunshine and visitors
drawn by the "Golden California"
legend makes summer even more
"country-clubbish" than Stanford is
said to be during the year. He predicted
a parade of high-fashion hotpants this
summer.

DARE TO STRUGGLE- Summer session at Stanford is not without its rigors.
Ixjng days of unbroken sunshine and debilitating periods of leisure, added to the
strain of maintaining a nine unit course load, can drive a person to the point of
mental health. This physics undergraduate is testing the mechanical properties of
concrete, while simultaneously measuring the solar constant and calculating the
rate of flow of water through the claw. Never a dull moment around here.
