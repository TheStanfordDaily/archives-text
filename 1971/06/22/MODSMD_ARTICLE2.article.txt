# Summer Sunshine Sells Stanford; Student Studies Sometimes Suffer
## 
### LARRY JOE Commentary 
Summer at Stanford: fewer people, a
slower pace, more sunshine, visitors
from the East Coast.
No one is sure just what makes the
biggest difference, but it's certain this
place has a new atmosphere from
mid-June to mid-August.
The summer student body shrinks by
almost two-thirds, as a walk through
Quad between classes makes clear.
Compare 4,000 summer students
actively taking undergraduate and
graduate courses to 11,000 in the fall
(figures based on last year's
enrollment).
Summer session director Sally
Mahoney believes the lower population
makes summer "more relaxed. Because
of the smaller numbers, there is a kind
of ease of meeting people and a general
friendliness."

There certainly are enough new
people to meet. The more than 2,000
regular Stanford graduate students who
toil through summer courses are joined
by almost 700 visitors. The percentage
of "foreigners" is even higher among
undergrads. Regular Stanford
undergrads out-register visitors from
other academic worlds by only 900 to
600.
Many of the visitors are
undergraduates from other schools
checking out Stanford as a graduate
school possibility, according to
Mahoney.
Forty or more of next year's high
school seniors are given a controlled
taste of college life during summer.
They are allowed to enroll only in
certain courses, mostly introductory.
The high schoolers will be concentrated
in Lagunita's Adelpha dorm— "where
they can support one another when
they don't know what's going on,"
according to a residence official.

A majority of the summer visitors on
all levels are women. Among graduate
students, men still outnumber women
by four to one. But among
undergraduates the Stanford
male-female ratio at iast reaches 1:1
during the summer.
Resident male chauvinists insist
summer session includes a greater
number of better-looking women than
the regular Stanford selection. An
amateur social critic said the
combination of sunshine and visitors
drawn by the "Golden California"
legend makes summer even more
"country-clubbish" than Stanford is
said to be during the year. He predicted
a parade of high-fashion hotpants this
summer.

DARE TO STRUGGLE- Summer session at Stanford is not without its rigors.
Ixjng days of unbroken sunshine and debilitating periods of leisure, added to the
strain of maintaining a nine unit course load, can drive a person to the point of
mental health. This physics undergraduate is testing the mechanical properties of
concrete, while simultaneously measuring the solar constant and calculating the
rate of flow of water through the claw. Never a dull moment around here.
Some on-campus entertainment is
planned for the summer, although the
lavish Stanford Summer Festival saw its
last cultural season two years ago. New
Orlean's Preservation Hall Jazz Band
will make its fifth campus appearance
in July. Old-time radio comedians Bob
and Ray will also perform next month.
Several campus drama groups are
planning summer schedules. And the
endless series of films unreeled by
campus entrepreneurs will be
supplemented by free Sunday night
"flicks" at the Lagunita dorms.

About 350 undergraduates will live
in Lagunita. up to 100 in several Wilbur
dorms, and others in the supposedly
temporary "pre-fabs" of Manzanita
Park. Many summer students live
off-campus, and some are dollar-a-day
fraternity boarders.
The summer award for creative
improvisation perhaps should to to the
small group of Stanford regulars, most
not enrolled for summer, who sleep out
on University land. They dodge the
persistant efforts of police to chase
them off and stake sleeping bag claims

in yards, behind bushes, and even on
grass strips of parking lots.
Courses
Although the summer course catalog
is not as hefty as the fall book, summer
classes offer a special kind of academic
variety. While some students find a
light combination of summer courses,
others are totally immersed in twelve
intensive units of German or six units
of organic chemistry.
Chinese and Japanese language
students will live together in Arroyo
house during thier ten-week battle with

Asian languages. And serious science
fiction fans will make their freaky
home in Eucalypto in the Institute for
Science Fiction and Fantasy.
Other summer workshops play at
making films and television newscasts,
study new teaching techniques, and
create computer-generated music.
Some say the visitors are too shy to
actively participate in classroom
discussions. But the visitors' defenders
point to their fresh reaction to every
Stanford event from a beach trips to
visiting downtown Palo Alto.

create computer-generated music.
Some say the visitors are too shy to
actively participate in classroom
discussions. But the visitors' defenders
point to their fresh reaction to every
Stanford event from a beach trips to
visiting downtown Palo Alto.
Summer at Stanford: fewer people, a
slower pace, more sunshine, visitors
from the East Coast.
No one is sure just what makes the
biggest difference, but it's certain this
place has a new atmosphere from
mid-June to mid-August.
The summer student body shrinks by
almost two-thirds, as a walk through
Quad between classes makes clear.
Compare 4,000 summer students
actively taking undergraduate and
graduate courses to 11,000 in the fall
(figures based on last year's
enrollment).
Summer session director Sally
Mahoney believes the lower population
makes summer "more relaxed. Because
of the smaller numbers, there is a kind
of ease of meeting people and a general
friendliness."

There certainly are enough new
people to meet. The more than 2,000
regular Stanford graduate students who
toil through summer courses are joined
by almost 700 visitors. The percentage
of "foreigners" is even higher among
undergrads. Regular Stanford
undergrads out-register visitors from
other academic worlds by only 900 to
600.
Many of the visitors are
undergraduates from other schools
checking out Stanford as a graduate
school possibility, according to
Mahoney.
Forty or more of next year's high
school seniors are given a controlled
taste of college life during summer.
They are allowed to enroll only in
certain courses, mostly introductory.
The high schoolers will be concentrated
in Lagunita's Adelpha dorm— "where
they can support one another when
they don't know what's going on,"
according to a residence official.

A majority of the summer visitors on
all levels are women. Among graduate
students, men still outnumber women
by four to one. But among
undergraduates the Stanford
male-female ratio at iast reaches 1:1
during the summer.
Resident male chauvinists insist
summer session includes a greater
number of better-looking women than
the regular Stanford selection. An
amateur social critic said the
combination of sunshine and visitors
drawn by the "Golden California"
legend makes summer even more
"country-clubbish" than Stanford is
said to be during the year. He predicted
a parade of high-fashion hotpants this
summer.

DARE TO STRUGGLE- Summer session at Stanford is not without its rigors.
Ixjng days of unbroken sunshine and debilitating periods of leisure, added to the
strain of maintaining a nine unit course load, can drive a person to the point of
mental health. This physics undergraduate is testing the mechanical properties of
concrete, while simultaneously measuring the solar constant and calculating the
rate of flow of water through the claw. Never a dull moment around here.
Some on-campus entertainment is
planned for the summer, although the
lavish Stanford Summer Festival saw its
last cultural season two years ago. New
Orlean's Preservation Hall Jazz Band
will make its fifth campus appearance
in July. Old-time radio comedians Bob
and Ray will also perform next month.
Several campus drama groups are
planning summer schedules. And the
endless series of films unreeled by
campus entrepreneurs will be
supplemented by free Sunday night
"flicks" at the Lagunita dorms.

About 350 undergraduates will live
in Lagunita. up to 100 in several Wilbur
dorms, and others in the supposedly
temporary "pre-fabs" of Manzanita
Park. Many summer students live
off-campus, and some are dollar-a-day
fraternity boarders.
The summer award for creative
improvisation perhaps should to to the
small group of Stanford regulars, most
not enrolled for summer, who sleep out
on University land. They dodge the
persistant efforts of police to chase
them off and stake sleeping bag claims

in yards, behind bushes, and even on
grass strips of parking lots.
Courses
Although the summer course catalog
is not as hefty as the fall book, summer
classes offer a special kind of academic
variety. While some students find a
light combination of summer courses,
others are totally immersed in twelve
intensive units of German or six units
of organic chemistry.
Chinese and Japanese language
students will live together in Arroyo
house during thier ten-week battle with

Asian languages. And serious science
fiction fans will make their freaky
home in Eucalypto in the Institute for
Science Fiction and Fantasy.
Other summer workshops play at
making films and television newscasts,
study new teaching techniques, and
create computer-generated music.
