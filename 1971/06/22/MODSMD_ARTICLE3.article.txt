# Informer Testifies About Bay Area Revolutionaries
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A Stanford revolutionary turned
FBI informer has leveled broad charges
of radical conspiracies ranging from
Stanford to Cuba.
Thomas Edward Mosher, 29,
testified before six sessions of the
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee
during February and March. The
transcript, released last week, reports on
Mosher's four years as a Bay Area
radical working undercover for the FBI,
CII (a State investigation agency), the
San Mateo Sheriff's Department, and
other police agencies.
Mosher's 114 pages of sworn
testimony, backed by little evidence
beyond his own statements:
—Charged Stanford's Maoist Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin had supplied advice,
weapons, and medical aid to the Black
Panthers.
—Alleged James E. Johnson, a
former Stanford radical now sought by
authorities, had constructed explosives
used throughout the Bay Area.
— Said Revolutionary Union
members had taken credit for a series
of Stanford Campus firebombings and
arson attempts in early 1970.
—Said it "was revealed" to him that
Johnson had set last year's fire at
Stanford's Behavioral Science Institute.
—Charged college radicals were given
encouragement during trips to Cuba.
Franklin told the Daily Mosher had
"hung around the edges" of the radical
movement and had long been a
suspected informer. He called him
"unbalanced" and said his testimony
"amounted to taking a list of all the
things that happened" in the Bay Area
and blaming certain radicals without
evidence. (See article, this page.)
The informer reportedly has fled the
area, fearing radical reprisals.
Mosher, who studied at Stanford but
never obtained a degree, said he first
worked with the FBI after a two-month
trip to Cuba in August, 1968. He said
he turned over his home movies of the
Tricontinental Congress in Havana
when the Palo Alto FBI agents
approached him.
He told the Senate committee,
headed by Mississippi's James Eastland,
that the Tricontinental was an effort to
link American campus radicals with
Latin American revolutionaries.
The Cubans glorified the Black
Panthers, according to Mosher. And
their "conversations more or less
suggested to us that the activities of
Mark Rudd and SDS (at Columbia
University the prior spring . . . were an
example of the sort of direction the
student movement should take in the
U.S. which it subsequently did."
But Mosher conceded the Cubans
gave general pep talks rather than
tactical advice and said their
endorsement of campus violence was
only "implicit in the conversations."
Mosher said he did not become an
active informer until April, 1 969. Both
radical and police sources suggested his
ties to intelligence agencies became
even stronger after he was convicted
and placed on probation for assaulting
a policeman in Redwood City one year
later.

Mosher was originally charged with
possessing illegal weapons police found
when investigating an argument
between him and his wife.
Mosher testified he had brought the
weapons to his home from a rural
radical cache three days earlier "with
the knowledge of the FBI."
Describing his espionage efforts after
1968, Mosher siad, "After returning
from Cuba ... I came out to California
and Stanford, established my
relationship with the FBI sometime
thereafter, and insinuated myself into a
relationship with the national office of
the Black Panther Party."
Mosher claimed he developed a close
relationship with top Black Panther
Randy Williams, although local radicals
insisted Mosher is an "egotist" who
always exaggerated his influence and
contacts.
Mosher described a meeting between
SDS members and Black Panthers in
September 1969. He said Panthers,
including Bobby Seale and David
Hilliard, met with Mosher, Bruce
Franklin, Bernadine Dohrn, Mark
Rudd, and other white radicals.
He charged Franklin, now suspended
from his English professorship because
of radical activities, had helped
Panthers on many other occasions.
In wording which revealed Mosher's
second-hand sources, the informer

testified he was told a member of the
Revolutionary Union Central
Committee (which Franklin and others
have since left to form Venceremos),
"had been present with Eldridge
Cleaver ... on the night of the alleged
shooting out which occurred in the
wake of Dr. King's death (April,
1968 )."
"I became aware of the fact that this
individual, Prof. Bruce Franklin, and
other members of the RU, had assisted
wounded members of the Black
Panther Party in obtaining surgery, had
supplied explosives and weapons to the
Panthers, were engaged in above-ground
propaganda efforts to support the
Panthers."
Mosher said he, Franklin, Panther
Williams, and other radicals went to the
Santa Cruz Mountains in March, 1969 ,
for a day of target practice and study
of high explosives.
Sometime after, he continued,
Williams came to Mosher's home and
other locations in Palo Alto and
Stanford looking for "C 4 or plastic"
explosives.
Mosher told the Senate examiner,
who challeged few of his broad
allegations, "My assumption is that the
C-4 came directly from Prof. Franklin."
The only reason Mosher gave for
his assumption was that "at the time
