# Informer Testifies About Bay Area Revolutionaries
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A Stanford revolutionary turned
FBI informer has leveled broad charges
of radical conspiracies ranging from
Stanford to Cuba.
Thomas Edward Mosher, 29,
testified before six sessions of the
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee
during February and March. The
transcript, released last week, reports on
Mosher's four years as a Bay Area
radical working undercover for the FBI,
CII (a State investigation agency), the
San Mateo Sheriff's Department, and
other police agencies.
Mosher's 114 pages of sworn
testimony, backed by little evidence
beyond his own statements:
—Charged Stanford's Maoist Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin had supplied advice,
weapons, and medical aid to the Black
Panthers.
—Alleged James E. Johnson, a
former Stanford radical now sought by
authorities, had constructed explosives
used throughout the Bay Area.
— Said Revolutionary Union
members had taken credit for a series
of Stanford Campus firebombings and
arson attempts in early 1970.
—Said it "was revealed" to him that
Johnson had set last year's fire at
Stanford's Behavioral Science Institute.
—Charged college radicals were given
encouragement during trips to Cuba.
Franklin told the Daily Mosher had
"hung around the edges" of the radical
movement and had long been a
suspected informer. He called him
"unbalanced" and said his testimony
"amounted to taking a list of all the
things that happened" in the Bay Area
and blaming certain radicals without
evidence. (See article, this page.)
The informer reportedly has fled the
area, fearing radical reprisals.
Mosher, who studied at Stanford but
never obtained a degree, said he first
worked with the FBI after a two-month
trip to Cuba in August, 1968. He said
he turned over his home movies of the
Tricontinental Congress in Havana
when the Palo Alto FBI agents
approached him.
He told the Senate committee,
headed by Mississippi's James Eastland,
that the Tricontinental was an effort to
link American campus radicals with
Latin American revolutionaries.
The Cubans glorified the Black
Panthers, according to Mosher. And
their "conversations more or less
suggested to us that the activities of
Mark Rudd and SDS (at Columbia
University the prior spring . . . were an
example of the sort of direction the
student movement should take in the
U.S. which it subsequently did."
But Mosher conceded the Cubans
gave general pep talks rather than
tactical advice and said their
endorsement of campus violence was
only "implicit in the conversations."
Mosher said he did not become an
active informer until April, 1 969. Both
radical and police sources suggested his
ties to intelligence agencies became
even stronger after he was convicted
and placed on probation for assaulting
a policeman in Redwood City one year
later.

Mosher was originally charged with
possessing illegal weapons police found
when investigating an argument
between him and his wife.
Mosher testified he had brought the
weapons to his home from a rural
radical cache three days earlier "with
the knowledge of the FBI."
Describing his espionage efforts after
1968, Mosher siad, "After returning
from Cuba ... I came out to California
and Stanford, established my
relationship with the FBI sometime
thereafter, and insinuated myself into a
relationship with the national office of
the Black Panther Party."
Mosher claimed he developed a close
relationship with top Black Panther
Randy Williams, although local radicals
insisted Mosher is an "egotist" who
always exaggerated his influence and
contacts.
Mosher described a meeting between
SDS members and Black Panthers in
September 1969. He said Panthers,
including Bobby Seale and David
Hilliard, met with Mosher, Bruce
Franklin, Bernadine Dohrn, Mark
Rudd, and other white radicals.
He charged Franklin, now suspended
from his English professorship because
of radical activities, had helped
Panthers on many other occasions.
In wording which revealed Mosher's
second-hand sources, the informer

testified he was told a member of the
Revolutionary Union Central
Committee (which Franklin and others
have since left to form Venceremos),
"had been present with Eldridge
Cleaver ... on the night of the alleged
shooting out which occurred in the
wake of Dr. King's death (April,
1968 )."
"I became aware of the fact that this
individual, Prof. Bruce Franklin, and
other members of the RU, had assisted
wounded members of the Black
Panther Party in obtaining surgery, had
supplied explosives and weapons to the
Panthers, were engaged in above-ground
propaganda efforts to support the
Panthers."
Mosher said he, Franklin, Panther
Williams, and other radicals went to the
Santa Cruz Mountains in March, 1969 ,
for a day of target practice and study
of high explosives.
Sometime after, he continued,
Williams came to Mosher's home and
other locations in Palo Alto and
Stanford looking for "C 4 or plastic"
explosives.
Mosher told the Senate examiner,
who challeged few of his broad
allegations, "My assumption is that the
C-4 came directly from Prof. Franklin."
The only reason Mosher gave for
his assumption was that "at the time
(of the March target practice) Prof.
Franklin revealed that he had sources
of explosives and technical knowledge
concerning their use."
A source close to local police
agencies said the only allegations by
Mosher backed by material evidence are
those against former Stanford radical
James E. Johnson.
considered Mosher a
trusted friend, according to local
described by the informer
as an explosives expert who
"constructed extremely sophisticated
timing devices" in a remote cabin in the
Santa Cruz Mountains.
Mosher said he had to repeatedly
bring explosives to the FBI from the
mountain cabin before he could
convince them to make a mid-February
raid which netted an arms cache in the
cabin.
He said after the raid Johnson, who
is black but not a Black Panther, told
him about the murder near the cabin of
Black Panther Anon "Fred" Bennett,
whose charred body police say they
found at the site.
Mosher testified that Johnson told
him Bennett was murdered by fellow
Panthers because he "had carried on a
sexual relationship" with Bobby Seale's
wife, who was carrying Bennett's child.
Mosher alleged that Johnson told
him he had seen the gruesome burning
of Bennett's gasoline-soaked body.
He said, "It was mentioned to me by
James Johnson . . . that the question of
taking a human life bothered him a
little bit. I dismissed the subject at the
time as being a consequence of his
having been left upon this land (the
cabin site) for a period of several
months."
San Francisco Examiner reporter Ed
Montgomery, who used Mosher as a
source for his reports on radical
activities, said Mosher told him the

"bomb factory" supplied explosives
used in bombings throughout the Bay
Area.
Mosher was also Montgomery's "key
source" for an article linking Johnson
to $100,000 arson in Spring, 1970; at
Stanford's Center for Advanced Study
in the Behavioral Sciences.
But Mosher's sworn testimony gave
only the circumspect report that, "It
was revealed to me by an individual
who helped plan that arson that he had
been involved in several other arsons
with members of the Revolutionary
Union (RU). The individual (sic) who
can be identified to the best of my
knowledge as having been involved was
one Michael Fox and one James
Johnson."
Fox, 17, is a white high school
activist.
Discussing other unsolved vandalism
during turmoil which followed the
Cambodian invasion, Johnson said the
Revolutinary Union took credit for an
attempted bombing of a Palo Alto FBI
office and "numerous acts of arson on
the Stanford campus."
"Among those acts of arson were an
attempted fire bombing of the
headquarters of the Free Campus
Movement (a conservative group) and
the burning of sheds and a storage
building on the Stanford campus."
Asked to describe his early
experiences as a radical-informer,
Mosher described Stanford's April
Third Movement (A3M) in spring,
1969. He said he had been involved in
the role of activist from the nonviolent
sit-ins at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory to the clashes with police at
the Stanford Research Institute.
Mosher said he helped build a
barricade set afire during the SRI
confrontation.
Mosher conceded that the A3M was
in large part a spontaneous mass
movement. But he implied there was a

hidden leadership by prominent
radicals.
He referred to a discussion of future
tactics after the first SRI clash by
"Fred Cohen, Leonard Siegel, and
other SDS leaders."
And although local radicals say that
well-known activists in the A3M were
not RU members, Mosher told the
Senate, "Throughout the development
of the entire movement at the Stanford
University, a leading role has been
played by key members of the
Revolutionary Union."
Mosher traced his activist leadings
from a 1965 trip to Mississippi as a civil
rights worker. He said his doubts began
then also, when "I began to have my
own questions about the motives of
the (leftists) who were responsible for
organizing support for the various
projects."
Mosher did not specify the
payments he received from the
different agencies he worked for. But
he said his early FBI work was not for
pay and described CII funds of $50
plus gas and travel expenses for one

assignment.
At the conclusion of his testimony,
Mosher named two of the agents he
"worked closely with," Agent Foster of
the CII San Francisco office and Lt.
Nino Lo Schiavo of the San Mateo
Sheriff's Department Intelligence
Division.
Mosher told the committee the
American public does not appreciate
"the legions of police officers who
work long hours in dangerous
circumstances."
He said police are "hamstrung" in
their work against radicals by the
"extraordinary emphasis within the
past several years upon the civil rights
of people suspected of crimes and
accused of crimes."
Mosher said he had witnessed "the
creation of a revolutionary fighting
force within the United States, still
loosely organized and in its primary
stages, but it does exist."
The Daily has learned Reader's
Digest has interviewed Mosher and may
feature his story in its August edition.
