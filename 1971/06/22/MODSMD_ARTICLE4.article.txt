"We were telling people two years ago that he was probably a pig," Prof.
Bruce Franklin said of T. Edward Mosher whose description of four years as
an informer was !.y s Senp'e subcommittee June 16. (See article, this
page.)
Franklin said he had long suspected Mosher was a police informer.
Franklin, who Mosher alleged provided weapons and advice to the Black
Panthers, told the Daily Mosher "hung around the edges" of the radical
movement.
Franklin and his wife Jane said Mosher had litt 5 of the inside information
his comments implied because few radicals trusted him.
The activist professor generally refused to either confirm or deny Mosher's
specific allegation, saying all revolutionaries should take credit for radical
actions.
"We make it a policy of never denying an act we approve of."
But reacting to Mosher's comments as a whole, Franklin said, "The
testimony would amount to taking a list of all the things that have happened
and saying the Revolutionary Union is responsible for them all. There is no
connection that he makes."
Franklin, who faces Stanford dismissal hearings for his radical activities,
said he became convinced Mosher was an informer during a party at the
Franklin home in Spring, 1 969.
Mosher tried to cause trouble at the party when "he picked a fight with a
guy and was pretending he was drunk," Franklin said.
He said that when he began telling other radicals Mosher seemed to be an
informer, "He begged me to stop telling people he was a pig and to just tell
them he was crazy."
Mosher became increasingly mentally unbalanced, according to Mrs.
Franklin, particularly after his wife left him.
And Franklin charged Mosher was a provocateur-encouraging the illegal
acts he was supposed to be spying on.
Mrs. Franklin said, "He was always suggesting wild schemes. Everybody
was suspicious of him because he always wanted to blow up something or kill
somebody."
Mosher's testimony suggests he was a government-paid informer who
himself broke the law—as in his description of his part in building a barricade
