# Franklin Tells His Side
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"We were telling people two years ago that he was probably a pig," Prof.
Bruce Franklin said of T. Edward Mosher whose description of four years as
an informer was !.y s Senp'e subcommittee June 16. (See article, this
page.)
Franklin said he had long suspected Mosher was a police informer.
Franklin, who Mosher alleged provided weapons and advice to the Black
Panthers, told the Daily Mosher "hung around the edges" of the radical
movement.
Franklin and his wife Jane said Mosher had litt 5 of the inside information
his comments implied because few radicals trusted him.
The activist professor generally refused to either confirm or deny Mosher's
specific allegation, saying all revolutionaries should take credit for radical
actions.
"We make it a policy of never denying an act we approve of."
But reacting to Mosher's comments as a whole, Franklin said, "The
testimony would amount to taking a list of all the things that have happened
and saying the Revolutionary Union is responsible for them all. There is no
connection that he makes."
Franklin, who faces Stanford dismissal hearings for his radical activities,
said he became convinced Mosher was an informer during a party at the
Franklin home in Spring, 1 969.
Mosher tried to cause trouble at the party when "he picked a fight with a
guy and was pretending he was drunk," Franklin said.
He said that when he began telling other radicals Mosher seemed to be an
informer, "He begged me to stop telling people he was a pig and to just tell
them he was crazy."
Mosher became increasingly mentally unbalanced, according to Mrs.
Franklin, particularly after his wife left him.
And Franklin charged Mosher was a provocateur-encouraging the illegal
acts he was supposed to be spying on.
Mrs. Franklin said, "He was always suggesting wild schemes. Everybody
was suspicious of him because he always wanted to blow up something or kill
somebody."
Mosher's testimony suggests he was a government-paid informer who
himself broke the law—as in his description of his part in building a barricade
during a confrontation at Stanford Research Institute in 1 969.
A veteran Stanford radical, who refused to be identified, said Mosher was
"very loud" and was "always trying to start a fight."
And the radical said his volatile personality may explain why Mosher got
along with the equally boisterous radical James Johnson, who "called him a
crazy man sometimes."
Johnson fled after Mosher told authorities the black activist was designing
explosives for revolutionaries.
Asked about Mosher's charges he worked with Black Panthers, Franklin
pointed to open approval of Panther activities by the group he belongs to,
Venceremos.
"The fact that we know Panthers shouldn't surprise anyone."
And Franklin admitted he has "done some target practice in the hills" but
he denied any knowledge of the Santa Cruz Mountain bomb factory Johnson
allegedly ran.
As for Mosher's comments about Cuban encouragement to American
radicals, Franklin said, "The Cubans hardly make a secret of the fact they're
in favor of revolution in the U.S."
But he said the Cubans were "scrupulous" in avoiding any specific
suggestions for radical tactics.
A campus radical scoffed at Mosher's lengthy testimony about the
"Mini-Manual," a booklet of tactics for leftist guerilla warfare. He said the
New Left still gets much better information from far-right and U.S. military
handbooks.
The same source said Mosher was always "ego-tripping," boasting "that he
was from a tough working-class neighborhood in Chicago."
And he said Mosher "bullshitted a lot," exaggerating his contacts with
Black Panthers and other radicals.

connection that he makes."
Franklin, who faces Stanford dismissal hearings for his radical activities,
said he became convinced Mosher was an informer during a party at the
Franklin home in Spring, 1 969.
Mosher tried to cause trouble at the party when "he picked a fight with a
guy and was pretending he was drunk," Franklin said.
He said that when he began telling other radicals Mosher seemed to be an
informer, "He begged me to stop telling people he was a pig and to just tell
them he was crazy."
Mosher became increasingly mentally unbalanced, according to Mrs.
Franklin, particularly after his wife left him.
And Franklin charged Mosher was a provocateur-encouraging the illegal
acts he was supposed to be spying on.
Mrs. Franklin said, "He was always suggesting wild schemes. Everybody
was suspicious of him because he always wanted to blow up something or kill
somebody."
Mosher's testimony suggests he was a government-paid informer who
himself broke the law—as in his description of his part in building a barricade
during a confrontation at Stanford Research Institute in 1 969.
A veteran Stanford radical, who refused to be identified, said Mosher was
"very loud" and was "always trying to start a fight."
And the radical said his volatile personality may explain why Mosher got
along with the equally boisterous radical James Johnson, who "called him a
crazy man sometimes."
Johnson fled after Mosher told authorities the black activist was designing
explosives for revolutionaries.
Asked about Mosher's charges he worked with Black Panthers, Franklin
pointed to open approval of Panther activities by the group he belongs to,
Venceremos.
"The fact that we know Panthers shouldn't surprise anyone."
And Franklin admitted he has "done some target practice in the hills" but
he denied any knowledge of the Santa Cruz Mountain bomb factory Johnson
allegedly ran.
As for Mosher's comments about Cuban encouragement to American
radicals, Franklin said, "The Cubans hardly make a secret of the fact they're
in favor of revolution in the U.S."
But he said the Cubans were "scrupulous" in avoiding any specific
suggestions for radical tactics.
A campus radical scoffed at Mosher's lengthy testimony about the
"Mini-Manual," a booklet of tactics for leftist guerilla warfare. He said the
New Left still gets much better information from far-right and U.S. military
handbooks.
The same source said Mosher was always "ego-tripping," boasting "that he
was from a tough working-class neighborhood in Chicago."
And he said Mosher "bullshitted a lot," exaggerating his contacts with
Black Panthers and other radicals.
"We were telling people two years ago that he was probably a pig," Prof.
Bruce Franklin said of T. Edward Mosher whose description of four years as
an informer was !.y s Senp'e subcommittee June 16. (See article, this
page.)
Franklin said he had long suspected Mosher was a police informer.
Franklin, who Mosher alleged provided weapons and advice to the Black
Panthers, told the Daily Mosher "hung around the edges" of the radical
movement.
Franklin and his wife Jane said Mosher had litt 5 of the inside information
his comments implied because few radicals trusted him.
The activist professor generally refused to either confirm or deny Mosher's
specific allegation, saying all revolutionaries should take credit for radical
actions.
"We make it a policy of never denying an act we approve of."
But reacting to Mosher's comments as a whole, Franklin said, "The
testimony would amount to taking a list of all the things that have happened
and saying the Revolutionary Union is responsible for them all. There is no
connection that he makes."
