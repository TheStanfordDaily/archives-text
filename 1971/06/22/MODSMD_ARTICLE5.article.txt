# Senate Governs Through Summer
## 
### RALPH KOSTANT 
An interim student government,
functioning under a by-law passed by
the ASSU Senate this spring, will
operate for the first time this Summer
Quarter.
The by-law created a Committee of
the Senate, consisting of any Senator or
his designated representative who so
informs the Senate Chairman at the last
regular meeting of the previous quarter.
The committee is the final
representative authority of ASSU and
functions until the regular Senate holds
its first meeting.
The wording of the by-law will also
allow the Committee to function
during quarter breaks. The Committee
for this summer, for example, assumed
power at the end of Spring quarter and
will continue until the newly elected
Senate holds its first meeting this fall.
Fills Vacancies
One important aspect of the new
Committee of the Senate is that it has
the power to make interim
appointments to university committees
on which students serve. Formerly,
when a vacancy occured while the
Senate was not in session, there would
often be considerable debate as to the
proper method of filling it.
Occassionally the President of the

University, the chairman of the
committee in question or the ASSU
President would make the
appointment.
The lack of such a body as the
Committee of the Senate led to several
problems last fall. Delays in the Senate
elections prevented the Student Senate
from holding its first regular meeting
until late in November. Consequently,
many student positions on university
committees remained vacant until
January. In some cases, important
committees could not function. Other
committees appointed students
themselves to the positions, and some
of these irregular appointments later
stirred considerable controversy.
The Committee of the Senate may
confirm candidates suggested by the
Senate Committee on Nominations
or actually make its own appointments
to fill student seats on committees.
Subject to Review
According to Senate Parlimentarian
Herb Borock all actions taken by the
Committee of the Senate are subject to
review by the Student Senate at its first
regular meeting. "The new Senate can
let all the decisions stand, or it can
overturn any of them," he explained.
Borock also noted the Committee of
the Senate cannot pass by-laws to direct
the Student Financial Manager to spend
\SSU funds or exercise certain other

major powers reserved to the Student
Senate by the ASSU Constitution.
The Committee of the Senate will
meet when called to do so by the
Senate Chairman or by the ASSU
President. The Senate Chairman must
also recognize the petition of seven

members of the Committee to call a
meeting.
A quorum for the Committee of the
Senate consists of just 11 members, as
opposed to the 21 members required to
hold an official meeting of the Student
Senate.
