# This Week In The 'Daily'
## 
### 
Today is Tuesday, June 22, 1971. On this date, in the year
1901, Adolf Ochs and Joseph Pulitzer had lunch at Luchow's.
Ochs ordered sauerbraten, while Pulitzer had the
wienerschnitzel. Both drank beer, dark. If such ins-and-outs of
high level journalism fascinate you, may we suggest The
Summer Daily. More than a wrapper for slightly ancient fish.
The Summer Daily (which is a special project of the notorious
Stanford Daily, and which is published Tuesday and Friday
during the summer quarter) is an opportunity for the summer
student to work in a congenial, low-pressure environment.
We need reporters, feature writers, typists, proof readers,
hangers-on, cooks, bottle-washers and fish-wrappers.
If you have any special talents or qualifications, such as the
ability to write or speak English, and you would like to join
us, come to the Daily office (in the Storke Publications
Building—look on any campus map) Thursday at 2p.m. Or call
our editorial office at ext. 4632.
As Ochs said to Pulitzer, "The Summer Daily is the best of
the wurst!"
