# Secret Pentagon Papers Document Vietnam Deception
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN News Analysis 
An incredible record of diplomatic and military
duplicity during the United States' escalation in
Vietnam was revealed last week in a series of articles
in the New York Times, and Washington Post.
The Times' analysis of a 47 volume, 7000 page
Pentagon study states that, "the American
commitments to cold and hot war overrode at every
stage every conventional consideration of domestic
and international law, of the rights of Congress, the
requirements of the Constitution, the sensibilities of
allies, the fate of individual personalities, the rights of
American citizens, and the most elementary standards
of truth."
Ihe Times, in its three parts, revealed new facts
behind President Johnson's decision to wage overt
aerial war against North Vietnam in 1965 and to
commit American Soldiers massively to combat in
South Vietnam in 1965. The Post in two articles
discussed the Eisenhower administration's attempt to
prevent nationwide election in Vietnam in 1954 and
the Johnson administrations use of bombing pauses in
1965 and 1968 to placate public opinion.
The Times' story included the following
conclusions:
"That the Truman Administration's decision to
give military aid to France in her colonial war against
the Communist-led Vietnam 'directly involved' the
United States in Vietnam and 'set' the course of
American policy.
"That the Eisenhower Administrations's decision
to rescue a fledgling South Vietnam from a
Communist takeover and attempt to undermine the
new Communist regime of North Vietnam gave the
Administration a 'direct role in the ultimate
breakdown of the Geneva settlement' for Indochina
in 1954.
Kennedy • 'Broad Commitment'
"That the Kennedy Administration, though
ultimately spared from major escalation decisions by
the death of its leader, transformed a policy of
'limited-risk gamble,' which it inherited, into a 'broad
commitment' that left President Johnson with a
choice between more war and withdrawal.
"That the Johnson Administration, though the
President was reluctant and hesitant to take the final
decisions, intensified the covert warfare against North
Vietnam and began planning in the Spring of 1964 to
wage overt war, a full year before it publicly revealed
the depth of its involvement and its fear of defeat.
"That this campaign of growing clandestine
military pressure through 1964 and the expanding
program of bombing North Vietnam in 1965 were
begun despite the judgment of the Government's
intelligence community that the measures would not
cause Hanoi to cease its support of the Vietcong
insurgency in the South, and that the bombing was
deemed militarily ineffective within a few months.

"That these four succeeding administrations built
up the American political, military and psychological
stakes in Indochina often more deeply than they
realized at the time, with large-scale military
equipment to the French in 1950, with moves that
encouraged and abetted the overthrow of President
Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963; with
plans, pledges and threats of further action that
sprang to life in the Tonkin Gulf clashes in August,
1964; with the careful preparation of public opinion
for the years of open warfare that were to follow; and
with the circulation in 1965, as the planes and troops
were openly committed to sustained combat, that
neither accomodation inside South Vietnam nor early
negotiations with North Vietnam would achieve the
desired result.
According to the Times study, the months from
the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in
August were a pivotal period. During this phase the
United States had been mounting clandestine military
attacks against North Vietnam and planning to obtain
a Congressional resolution that the Administration
regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of war.
The papers make it clear that these far-reaching
measures were not improvised in the heat of the
Tonkin crisis.
It is also made clear that plans for an active U.S.
role in the war were made in Spring of 1964, a full
year before the first heavy bombing strikes on North
Vietnam and the introduction of combat forces in the
South.
In a memorandum Jan. 22, 1964, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff suggested to Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara that the United States take over the
tactical conduct of the war from the South
Vietnamese, bomb North Vietnam "using U.S.
resources under Vietnamese cover" and support
South Vietnamese commando raids in the North.
Vietnam —'Plan 34 A'
Clandestine activities began in February, under the
code name of Operation Plan 34-A. They consisted of
South Vietnamese commando raids along the coast to
destroy rail and highway bridges, the parachuting of
sabotage and psychological warfare teams into the
North and kidnaping of North Vietnamese to obtain
information. U2 spy flights also were flown over the
North.
A plan sent to Johnson in May 1964 from William
P. Bundy, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern
affairs, suggested increasing military pressure on
North Vietnam culminating in full-scale bombing by
U.S. planes. It also suggested a congressional
resolution "authorizing whatever is necessary with
respect to Vietnam."
In August, the U.S. destroyer Maddox, in the Gulf
of Tonkin to gather intelligence for commando raids,
reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo
boats. The Maddox was joined by the destroyer C.
Turner Joy, which also came under the torpedo
boats' attack.
Within 12 hours of the time news reached

Washington, U.S. planes were on the way to North
Vietnam for the first retaliatory bombing raids.
The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, drafted by the
administration, and giving Johnson broad powers to
conduct operations in Vietnam, passed Congress
easily.
'Tactical Considerations'
During September at a White House strategy
meeting there was a general consensus that air strikes
against North Vietnam were necessary early in 1965
but "tactical considerations" required a delay.
The most important tactical consideration was
that Johnson was running for re-election as "the
candidate of reason and restraint." Johnson was
saying at the time, "We want no wider war."
On Nov. 3, the day Johnson was elected in a
landslide victory, Bundy was meeting with a group to
draw up various political and military options for
action against North Vietnam.
Bombing Recommendations
Cabinet level meetings continued through
November debating what recommendations should be
made for bombing the North. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said that while he favored bombing the North,
he disagreed with Bundy that if the raids failed to
save the weak South Vietnamese government "we
would at least obtain international credit for trying."
"In his view," the report says,"the harder we
tried and failed the worse our situation would be."
Finally, a plan furnished by General Maxwell
Taylor, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was
recommended to the President. It included increasing
air strikes gradually against North Vietnam. They
would last two to six months during which Hanoi was
expected to yield and agree to negotiate to end the
war.
Operation Rolling Thunder
By the end of February the administration ordered
Operation Rolling Thunder, the continuous bombing
of North Vietnam on a rising scale, to begin.
The Pentagon analysis states that "Once set in
motion, however, the bombing effort seemed to
stiffen rather than soften Hanoi's backbone."
At this point the United States had two options
according to the report. It could withdraw from
Vietnam, leaving the South Vietnamese to their fate,
or it could "commit ground forces in pursuit of its
objectives."
Johnson — Conflicting Statements
On April 1, 1965, the administration ordered two
battalions of U.S. Marines at Da Nang to take the
offensive. Johnson also decided to send ashore two
more battalions of Marines and to increase support
forces in South Vietnam. These orders were kept
secret.
The day before, when meeting with reporters,
Johnson was asked about any dramatic new
developments. He replied, "I know of no far-reaching
strategy that is being considered."

John A. McCone, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, at the time sent a note to Rusk
saying the decision to commit troops "is correct only
if our air strikes against the North Vietnamese are
sufficiently heavy and damaging to hurt the North
Vietnamese.
"In effect we will find ourselves mired down in
combat in the jungle in a military effort that we
cannot win and from which we will have extreme
difficulty extricating ourselves," he argued.
In June, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, U.S.
commander in South Vietnam, called for 200,000
troops to hold off defeat long enough to permit an
American buildup.
"Swiftly and in an atmosphere of crisis," Johnson
gave his approval, according to the study, and ordered
the additional troops to South Vietnam in mid-July.
This decision was also concealed.
Popularity Halts Elections
The Post's first article dealt with the Eisenhower
administration's attempt to reduce the possibility
that the 1954 Geneva Conference would call for
nationwide elections. Intelligence reports showed that
elections throughout North and South Vietnam
would probably give victory to Ho Chi Minh.
The Geneva accords did call for an election in
1956, but none was allowed to take place. According
to the report it was Ngo Dinh Diem, far more than
the American government, who was responsible for
the elections' not taking place. Diem flatly refused
even to discuss the elections with the Communist
regime in Hamoi.
The second Post article reveals that the Johnson
Administration's strategists had little expectation that
the pauses in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965
and 1968 would produce peace talks.
But the Johnson Administration policy-makers did
believe the halts Washington ordered from time to
time in its air attacks on North Vietnam "would help
placate domestic and world opinion," according to
the account.
"The Pentagon study discloses that some
strategists in the Johnson Administration planned to
use unproductive bombing pauses as a justification
for escalating the war.
"These planners regarded the lulls in bombing as a
'ratchet' to reduce tension and then intensify it, to
produce 'one more turn of the screw' in order to
'crack the enemy's resistance to negotiations,' the
report states."
Both the Times and the Post planned more
articles, but were prevented by injunctions handed
down by Federal Court. Although rulings so far have
been in favor of the newspapers, the United States is
appealing the decisions and further publication of the
documents has been put off indefinately.

commitment' that left President Johnson with a
choice between more war and withdrawal.
"That the Johnson Administration, though the
President was reluctant and hesitant to take the final
decisions, intensified the covert warfare against North
Vietnam and began planning in the Spring of 1964 to
wage overt war, a full year before it publicly revealed
the depth of its involvement and its fear of defeat.
"That this campaign of growing clandestine
military pressure through 1964 and the expanding
program of bombing North Vietnam in 1965 were
begun despite the judgment of the Government's
intelligence community that the measures would not
cause Hanoi to cease its support of the Vietcong
insurgency in the South, and that the bombing was
deemed militarily ineffective within a few months.

"That these four succeeding administrations built
up the American political, military and psychological
stakes in Indochina often more deeply than they
realized at the time, with large-scale military
equipment to the French in 1950, with moves that
encouraged and abetted the overthrow of President
Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963; with
plans, pledges and threats of further action that
sprang to life in the Tonkin Gulf clashes in August,
1964; with the careful preparation of public opinion
for the years of open warfare that were to follow; and
with the circulation in 1965, as the planes and troops
were openly committed to sustained combat, that
neither accomodation inside South Vietnam nor early
negotiations with North Vietnam would achieve the
desired result.
According to the Times study, the months from
the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in
August were a pivotal period. During this phase the
United States had been mounting clandestine military
attacks against North Vietnam and planning to obtain
a Congressional resolution that the Administration
regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of war.
The papers make it clear that these far-reaching
measures were not improvised in the heat of the
Tonkin crisis.
It is also made clear that plans for an active U.S.
role in the war were made in Spring of 1964, a full
year before the first heavy bombing strikes on North
Vietnam and the introduction of combat forces in the
South.
In a memorandum Jan. 22, 1964, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff suggested to Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara that the United States take over the
tactical conduct of the war from the South
Vietnamese, bomb North Vietnam "using U.S.
resources under Vietnamese cover" and support
South Vietnamese commando raids in the North.
Vietnam —'Plan 34 A'
Clandestine activities began in February, under the
code name of Operation Plan 34-A. They consisted of
South Vietnamese commando raids along the coast to
destroy rail and highway bridges, the parachuting of
sabotage and psychological warfare teams into the
North and kidnaping of North Vietnamese to obtain
information. U2 spy flights also were flown over the
North.
A plan sent to Johnson in May 1964 from William
P. Bundy, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern
affairs, suggested increasing military pressure on
North Vietnam culminating in full-scale bombing by
U.S. planes. It also suggested a congressional
resolution "authorizing whatever is necessary with
respect to Vietnam."
In August, the U.S. destroyer Maddox, in the Gulf
of Tonkin to gather intelligence for commando raids,
reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo
boats. The Maddox was joined by the destroyer C.
Turner Joy, which also came under the torpedo
boats' attack.
Within 12 hours of the time news reached

Washington, U.S. planes were on the way to North
Vietnam for the first retaliatory bombing raids.
The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, drafted by the
administration, and giving Johnson broad powers to
conduct operations in Vietnam, passed Congress
easily.
'Tactical Considerations'
During September at a White House strategy
meeting there was a general consensus that air strikes
against North Vietnam were necessary early in 1965
but "tactical considerations" required a delay.
The most important tactical consideration was
that Johnson was running for re-election as "the
candidate of reason and restraint." Johnson was
saying at the time, "We want no wider war."
On Nov. 3, the day Johnson was elected in a
landslide victory, Bundy was meeting with a group to
draw up various political and military options for
action against North Vietnam.
Bombing Recommendations
Cabinet level meetings continued through
November debating what recommendations should be
made for bombing the North. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said that while he favored bombing the North,
he disagreed with Bundy that if the raids failed to
save the weak South Vietnamese government "we
would at least obtain international credit for trying."
"In his view," the report says,"the harder we
tried and failed the worse our situation would be."
Finally, a plan furnished by General Maxwell
Taylor, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was
recommended to the President. It included increasing
air strikes gradually against North Vietnam. They
would last two to six months during which Hanoi was
expected to yield and agree to negotiate to end the
war.
Operation Rolling Thunder
By the end of February the administration ordered
Operation Rolling Thunder, the continuous bombing
of North Vietnam on a rising scale, to begin.
The Pentagon analysis states that "Once set in
motion, however, the bombing effort seemed to
stiffen rather than soften Hanoi's backbone."
At this point the United States had two options
according to the report. It could withdraw from
Vietnam, leaving the South Vietnamese to their fate,
or it could "commit ground forces in pursuit of its
objectives."
Johnson — Conflicting Statements
On April 1, 1965, the administration ordered two
battalions of U.S. Marines at Da Nang to take the
offensive. Johnson also decided to send ashore two
more battalions of Marines and to increase support
forces in South Vietnam. These orders were kept
secret.
The day before, when meeting with reporters,
Johnson was asked about any dramatic new
developments. He replied, "I know of no far-reaching
strategy that is being considered."

John A. McCone, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, at the time sent a note to Rusk
saying the decision to commit troops "is correct only
if our air strikes against the North Vietnamese are
sufficiently heavy and damaging to hurt the North
Vietnamese.
"In effect we will find ourselves mired down in
combat in the jungle in a military effort that we
cannot win and from which we will have extreme
difficulty extricating ourselves," he argued.
In June, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, U.S.
commander in South Vietnam, called for 200,000
troops to hold off defeat long enough to permit an
American buildup.
"Swiftly and in an atmosphere of crisis," Johnson
gave his approval, according to the study, and ordered
the additional troops to South Vietnam in mid-July.
This decision was also concealed.
Popularity Halts Elections
The Post's first article dealt with the Eisenhower
administration's attempt to reduce the possibility
that the 1954 Geneva Conference would call for
nationwide elections. Intelligence reports showed that
elections throughout North and South Vietnam
would probably give victory to Ho Chi Minh.
The Geneva accords did call for an election in
1956, but none was allowed to take place. According
to the report it was Ngo Dinh Diem, far more than
the American government, who was responsible for
the elections' not taking place. Diem flatly refused
even to discuss the elections with the Communist
regime in Hamoi.
The second Post article reveals that the Johnson
Administration's strategists had little expectation that
the pauses in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965
and 1968 would produce peace talks.
But the Johnson Administration policy-makers did
believe the halts Washington ordered from time to
time in its air attacks on North Vietnam "would help
placate domestic and world opinion," according to
the account.
"The Pentagon study discloses that some
strategists in the Johnson Administration planned to
use unproductive bombing pauses as a justification
for escalating the war.
"These planners regarded the lulls in bombing as a
'ratchet' to reduce tension and then intensify it, to
produce 'one more turn of the screw' in order to
'crack the enemy's resistance to negotiations,' the
report states."
Both the Times and the Post planned more
articles, but were prevented by injunctions handed
down by Federal Court. Although rulings so far have
been in favor of the newspapers, the United States is
appealing the decisions and further publication of the
documents has been put off indefinately.
An incredible record of diplomatic and military
duplicity during the United States' escalation in
Vietnam was revealed last week in a series of articles
in the New York Times, and Washington Post.
The Times' analysis of a 47 volume, 7000 page
Pentagon study states that, "the American
commitments to cold and hot war overrode at every
stage every conventional consideration of domestic
and international law, of the rights of Congress, the
requirements of the Constitution, the sensibilities of
allies, the fate of individual personalities, the rights of
American citizens, and the most elementary standards
of truth."
Ihe Times, in its three parts, revealed new facts
behind President Johnson's decision to wage overt
aerial war against North Vietnam in 1965 and to
commit American Soldiers massively to combat in
South Vietnam in 1965. The Post in two articles
discussed the Eisenhower administration's attempt to
prevent nationwide election in Vietnam in 1954 and
the Johnson administrations use of bombing pauses in
1965 and 1968 to placate public opinion.
The Times' story included the following
conclusions:
"That the Truman Administration's decision to
give military aid to France in her colonial war against
the Communist-led Vietnam 'directly involved' the
United States in Vietnam and 'set' the course of
American policy.
"That the Eisenhower Administrations's decision
to rescue a fledgling South Vietnam from a
Communist takeover and attempt to undermine the
new Communist regime of North Vietnam gave the
Administration a 'direct role in the ultimate
breakdown of the Geneva settlement' for Indochina
in 1954.
Kennedy • 'Broad Commitment'
"That the Kennedy Administration, though
ultimately spared from major escalation decisions by
the death of its leader, transformed a policy of

The papers make it clear that these far-reaching
measures were not improvised in the heat of the
Tonkin crisis.
It is also made clear that plans for an active U.S.
role in the war were made in Spring of 1964, a full
year before the first heavy bombing strikes on North
Vietnam and the introduction of combat forces in the
South.
In a memorandum Jan. 22, 1964, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff suggested to Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara that the United States take over the
tactical conduct of the war from the South
Vietnamese, bomb North Vietnam "using U.S.
resources under Vietnamese cover" and support
South Vietnamese commando raids in the North.
Vietnam —'Plan 34 A'
Clandestine activities began in February, under the
code name of Operation Plan 34-A. They consisted of
South Vietnamese commando raids along the coast to
destroy rail and highway bridges, the parachuting of
sabotage and psychological warfare teams into the
North and kidnaping of North Vietnamese to obtain
information. U2 spy flights also were flown over the
North.
A plan sent to Johnson in May 1964 from William
P. Bundy, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern
affairs, suggested increasing military pressure on
North Vietnam culminating in full-scale bombing by
U.S. planes. It also suggested a congressional
resolution "authorizing whatever is necessary with
respect to Vietnam."
In August, the U.S. destroyer Maddox, in the Gulf
of Tonkin to gather intelligence for commando raids,
reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo
boats. The Maddox was joined by the destroyer C.
Turner Joy, which also came under the torpedo
boats' attack.
Within 12 hours of the time news reached

Washington, U.S. planes were on the way to North
Vietnam for the first retaliatory bombing raids.
The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, drafted by the
administration, and giving Johnson broad powers to
conduct operations in Vietnam, passed Congress
easily.
'Tactical Considerations'
During September at a White House strategy
meeting there was a general consensus that air strikes
against North Vietnam were necessary early in 1965
but "tactical considerations" required a delay.
The most important tactical consideration was
that Johnson was running for re-election as "the
candidate of reason and restraint." Johnson was
saying at the time, "We want no wider war."
On Nov. 3, the day Johnson was elected in a
landslide victory, Bundy was meeting with a group to
draw up various political and military options for
action against North Vietnam.
Bombing Recommendations
Cabinet level meetings continued through
November debating what recommendations should be
made for bombing the North. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said that while he favored bombing the North,
he disagreed with Bundy that if the raids failed to
save the weak South Vietnamese government "we
would at least obtain international credit for trying."
"In his view," the report says,"the harder we
tried and failed the worse our situation would be."
Finally, a plan furnished by General Maxwell
Taylor, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was
recommended to the President. It included increasing
air strikes gradually against North Vietnam. They
would last two to six months during which Hanoi was
expected to yield and agree to negotiate to end the
war.
Operation Rolling Thunder
By the end of February the administration ordered
Operation Rolling Thunder, the continuous bombing
of North Vietnam on a rising scale, to begin.
The Pentagon analysis states that "Once set in
motion, however, the bombing effort seemed to
stiffen rather than soften Hanoi's backbone."
At this point the United States had two options
according to the report. It could withdraw from
Vietnam, leaving the South Vietnamese to their fate,
or it could "commit ground forces in pursuit of its
objectives."
Johnson — Conflicting Statements
On April 1, 1965, the administration ordered two
battalions of U.S. Marines at Da Nang to take the
offensive. Johnson also decided to send ashore two
more battalions of Marines and to increase support
forces in South Vietnam. These orders were kept
secret.
The day before, when meeting with reporters,
Johnson was asked about any dramatic new
developments. He replied, "I know of no far-reaching
strategy that is being considered."

John A. McCone, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, at the time sent a note to Rusk
saying the decision to commit troops "is correct only
if our air strikes against the North Vietnamese are
sufficiently heavy and damaging to hurt the North
Vietnamese.
"In effect we will find ourselves mired down in
combat in the jungle in a military effort that we
cannot win and from which we will have extreme
difficulty extricating ourselves," he argued.
In June, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, U.S.
commander in South Vietnam, called for 200,000
troops to hold off defeat long enough to permit an
American buildup.
"Swiftly and in an atmosphere of crisis," Johnson
gave his approval, according to the study, and ordered
the additional troops to South Vietnam in mid-July.
This decision was also concealed.
Popularity Halts Elections
The Post's first article dealt with the Eisenhower
administration's attempt to reduce the possibility
that the 1954 Geneva Conference would call for
nationwide elections. Intelligence reports showed that
elections throughout North and South Vietnam
would probably give victory to Ho Chi Minh.
The Geneva accords did call for an election in
1956, but none was allowed to take place. According
to the report it was Ngo Dinh Diem, far more than
the American government, who was responsible for
the elections' not taking place. Diem flatly refused
even to discuss the elections with the Communist
regime in Hamoi.
The second Post article reveals that the Johnson
Administration's strategists had little expectation that
the pauses in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965
and 1968 would produce peace talks.
But the Johnson Administration policy-makers did
believe the halts Washington ordered from time to
time in its air attacks on North Vietnam "would help
placate domestic and world opinion," according to
the account.
"The Pentagon study discloses that some
strategists in the Johnson Administration planned to
use unproductive bombing pauses as a justification
for escalating the war.
"These planners regarded the lulls in bombing as a
'ratchet' to reduce tension and then intensify it, to
produce 'one more turn of the screw' in order to
'crack the enemy's resistance to negotiations,' the
report states."
Both the Times and the Post planned more
articles, but were prevented by injunctions handed
down by Federal Court. Although rulings so far have
been in favor of the newspapers, the United States is
appealing the decisions and further publication of the
documents has been put off indefinately.
An incredible record of diplomatic and military
duplicity during the United States' escalation in
Vietnam was revealed last week in a series of articles
in the New York Times, and Washington Post.
The Times' analysis of a 47 volume, 7000 page
Pentagon study states that, "the American
commitments to cold and hot war overrode at every
stage every conventional consideration of domestic
and international law, of the rights of Congress, the
requirements of the Constitution, the sensibilities of
allies, the fate of individual personalities, the rights of
American citizens, and the most elementary standards
of truth."
Ihe Times, in its three parts, revealed new facts
behind President Johnson's decision to wage overt
aerial war against North Vietnam in 1965 and to
commit American Soldiers massively to combat in
South Vietnam in 1965. The Post in two articles
discussed the Eisenhower administration's attempt to
prevent nationwide election in Vietnam in 1954 and
the Johnson administrations use of bombing pauses in
1965 and 1968 to placate public opinion.
The Times' story included the following
conclusions:
"That the Truman Administration's decision to
give military aid to France in her colonial war against
the Communist-led Vietnam 'directly involved' the
United States in Vietnam and 'set' the course of
American policy.
"That the Eisenhower Administrations's decision
to rescue a fledgling South Vietnam from a
Communist takeover and attempt to undermine the
new Communist regime of North Vietnam gave the
Administration a 'direct role in the ultimate
breakdown of the Geneva settlement' for Indochina
in 1954.
Kennedy • 'Broad Commitment'
"That the Kennedy Administration, though
ultimately spared from major escalation decisions by
the death of its leader, transformed a policy of
'limited-risk gamble,' which it inherited, into a 'broad
commitment' that left President Johnson with a
choice between more war and withdrawal.
"That the Johnson Administration, though the
President was reluctant and hesitant to take the final
decisions, intensified the covert warfare against North
Vietnam and began planning in the Spring of 1964 to
wage overt war, a full year before it publicly revealed
the depth of its involvement and its fear of defeat.
"That this campaign of growing clandestine
military pressure through 1964 and the expanding
program of bombing North Vietnam in 1965 were
begun despite the judgment of the Government's
intelligence community that the measures would not
cause Hanoi to cease its support of the Vietcong
insurgency in the South, and that the bombing was
deemed militarily ineffective within a few months.

"That these four succeeding administrations built
up the American political, military and psychological
stakes in Indochina often more deeply than they
realized at the time, with large-scale military
equipment to the French in 1950, with moves that
encouraged and abetted the overthrow of President
Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963; with
plans, pledges and threats of further action that
sprang to life in the Tonkin Gulf clashes in August,
1964; with the careful preparation of public opinion
for the years of open warfare that were to follow; and
with the circulation in 1965, as the planes and troops
were openly committed to sustained combat, that
neither accomodation inside South Vietnam nor early
negotiations with North Vietnam would achieve the
desired result.
According to the Times study, the months from
the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in
August were a pivotal period. During this phase the
United States had been mounting clandestine military
attacks against North Vietnam and planning to obtain
a Congressional resolution that the Administration
regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of war.

The Gulf of Tonkin resolution, drafted by the
administration, and giving Johnson broad powers to
conduct operations in Vietnam, passed Congress
easily.
'Tactical Considerations'
During September at a White House strategy
meeting there was a general consensus that air strikes
against North Vietnam were necessary early in 1965
but "tactical considerations" required a delay.
The most important tactical consideration was
that Johnson was running for re-election as "the
candidate of reason and restraint." Johnson was
saying at the time, "We want no wider war."
On Nov. 3, the day Johnson was elected in a
landslide victory, Bundy was meeting with a group to
draw up various political and military options for
action against North Vietnam.
Bombing Recommendations
Cabinet level meetings continued through
November debating what recommendations should be
made for bombing the North. Secretary of State Dean
Rusk said that while he favored bombing the North,
he disagreed with Bundy that if the raids failed to
save the weak South Vietnamese government "we
would at least obtain international credit for trying."
"In his view," the report says,"the harder we
tried and failed the worse our situation would be."
Finally, a plan furnished by General Maxwell
Taylor, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, was
recommended to the President. It included increasing
air strikes gradually against North Vietnam. They
would last two to six months during which Hanoi was
expected to yield and agree to negotiate to end the
war.
Operation Rolling Thunder
By the end of February the administration ordered
Operation Rolling Thunder, the continuous bombing
of North Vietnam on a rising scale, to begin.
The Pentagon analysis states that "Once set in
motion, however, the bombing effort seemed to
stiffen rather than soften Hanoi's backbone."
At this point the United States had two options
according to the report. It could withdraw from
Vietnam, leaving the South Vietnamese to their fate,
or it could "commit ground forces in pursuit of its
objectives."
Johnson — Conflicting Statements
On April 1, 1965, the administration ordered two
battalions of U.S. Marines at Da Nang to take the
offensive. Johnson also decided to send ashore two
more battalions of Marines and to increase support
forces in South Vietnam. These orders were kept
secret.
The day before, when meeting with reporters,
Johnson was asked about any dramatic new
developments. He replied, "I know of no far-reaching
strategy that is being considered."

John A. McCone, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, at the time sent a note to Rusk
saying the decision to commit troops "is correct only
if our air strikes against the North Vietnamese are
sufficiently heavy and damaging to hurt the North
Vietnamese.
"In effect we will find ourselves mired down in
combat in the jungle in a military effort that we
cannot win and from which we will have extreme
difficulty extricating ourselves," he argued.
In June, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, U.S.
commander in South Vietnam, called for 200,000
troops to hold off defeat long enough to permit an
American buildup.
"Swiftly and in an atmosphere of crisis," Johnson
gave his approval, according to the study, and ordered
the additional troops to South Vietnam in mid-July.
This decision was also concealed.
Popularity Halts Elections
The Post's first article dealt with the Eisenhower
administration's attempt to reduce the possibility
that the 1954 Geneva Conference would call for
nationwide elections. Intelligence reports showed that
elections throughout North and South Vietnam
would probably give victory to Ho Chi Minh.
The Geneva accords did call for an election in
1956, but none was allowed to take place. According
to the report it was Ngo Dinh Diem, far more than
the American government, who was responsible for
the elections' not taking place. Diem flatly refused
even to discuss the elections with the Communist
regime in Hamoi.
The second Post article reveals that the Johnson
Administration's strategists had little expectation that
the pauses in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965
and 1968 would produce peace talks.
But the Johnson Administration policy-makers did
believe the halts Washington ordered from time to
time in its air attacks on North Vietnam "would help
placate domestic and world opinion," according to
the account.
"The Pentagon study discloses that some
strategists in the Johnson Administration planned to
use unproductive bombing pauses as a justification
for escalating the war.
"These planners regarded the lulls in bombing as a
'ratchet' to reduce tension and then intensify it, to
produce 'one more turn of the screw' in order to
'crack the enemy's resistance to negotiations,' the
report states."
Both the Times and the Post planned more
articles, but were prevented by injunctions handed
down by Federal Court. Although rulings so far have
been in favor of the newspapers, the United States is
appealing the decisions and further publication of the
documents has been put off indefinately.
An incredible record of diplomatic and military
duplicity during the United States' escalation in
Vietnam was revealed last week in a series of articles
in the New York Times, and Washington Post.
The Times' analysis of a 47 volume, 7000 page
Pentagon study states that, "the American
commitments to cold and hot war overrode at every
stage every conventional consideration of domestic
and international law, of the rights of Congress, the
requirements of the Constitution, the sensibilities of
allies, the fate of individual personalities, the rights of
American citizens, and the most elementary standards
of truth."
Ihe Times, in its three parts, revealed new facts
behind President Johnson's decision to wage overt
aerial war against North Vietnam in 1965 and to
commit American Soldiers massively to combat in
South Vietnam in 1965. The Post in two articles
discussed the Eisenhower administration's attempt to
prevent nationwide election in Vietnam in 1954 and
the Johnson administrations use of bombing pauses in
1965 and 1968 to placate public opinion.
The Times' story included the following
conclusions:
"That the Truman Administration's decision to
give military aid to France in her colonial war against
the Communist-led Vietnam 'directly involved' the
United States in Vietnam and 'set' the course of
American policy.
"That the Eisenhower Administrations's decision
to rescue a fledgling South Vietnam from a
Communist takeover and attempt to undermine the
new Communist regime of North Vietnam gave the
Administration a 'direct role in the ultimate
breakdown of the Geneva settlement' for Indochina
in 1954.
Kennedy • 'Broad Commitment'
"That the Kennedy Administration, though
ultimately spared from major escalation decisions by
the death of its leader, transformed a policy of
'limited-risk gamble,' which it inherited, into a 'broad
commitment' that left President Johnson with a
choice between more war and withdrawal.
"That the Johnson Administration, though the
President was reluctant and hesitant to take the final
decisions, intensified the covert warfare against North
Vietnam and began planning in the Spring of 1964 to
wage overt war, a full year before it publicly revealed
the depth of its involvement and its fear of defeat.
"That this campaign of growing clandestine
military pressure through 1964 and the expanding
program of bombing North Vietnam in 1965 were
begun despite the judgment of the Government's
intelligence community that the measures would not
cause Hanoi to cease its support of the Vietcong
insurgency in the South, and that the bombing was
deemed militarily ineffective within a few months.

"That these four succeeding administrations built
up the American political, military and psychological
stakes in Indochina often more deeply than they
realized at the time, with large-scale military
equipment to the French in 1950, with moves that
encouraged and abetted the overthrow of President
Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam in 1963; with
plans, pledges and threats of further action that
sprang to life in the Tonkin Gulf clashes in August,
1964; with the careful preparation of public opinion
for the years of open warfare that were to follow; and
with the circulation in 1965, as the planes and troops
were openly committed to sustained combat, that
neither accomodation inside South Vietnam nor early
negotiations with North Vietnam would achieve the
desired result.
According to the Times study, the months from
the beginning of 1964 to the Tonkin Gulf incident in
August were a pivotal period. During this phase the
United States had been mounting clandestine military
attacks against North Vietnam and planning to obtain
a Congressional resolution that the Administration
regarded as the equivalent of a declaration of war.
The papers make it clear that these far-reaching
measures were not improvised in the heat of the
Tonkin crisis.
It is also made clear that plans for an active U.S.
role in the war were made in Spring of 1964, a full
year before the first heavy bombing strikes on North
Vietnam and the introduction of combat forces in the
South.
In a memorandum Jan. 22, 1964, the Joint Chiefs
of Staff suggested to Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara that the United States take over the
tactical conduct of the war from the South
Vietnamese, bomb North Vietnam "using U.S.
resources under Vietnamese cover" and support
South Vietnamese commando raids in the North.
Vietnam —'Plan 34 A'
Clandestine activities began in February, under the
code name of Operation Plan 34-A. They consisted of
South Vietnamese commando raids along the coast to
destroy rail and highway bridges, the parachuting of
sabotage and psychological warfare teams into the
North and kidnaping of North Vietnamese to obtain
information. U2 spy flights also were flown over the
North.
A plan sent to Johnson in May 1964 from William
P. Bundy, assistant secretary of state for Far Eastern
affairs, suggested increasing military pressure on
North Vietnam culminating in full-scale bombing by
U.S. planes. It also suggested a congressional
resolution "authorizing whatever is necessary with
respect to Vietnam."
In August, the U.S. destroyer Maddox, in the Gulf
of Tonkin to gather intelligence for commando raids,
reported an attack by North Vietnamese torpedo
boats. The Maddox was joined by the destroyer C.
Turner Joy, which also came under the torpedo
boats' attack.
Within 12 hours of the time news reached

Washington, U.S. planes were on the way to North

or it could "commit ground forces in pursuit of its
objectives."
Johnson — Conflicting Statements
On April 1, 1965, the administration ordered two
battalions of U.S. Marines at Da Nang to take the
offensive. Johnson also decided to send ashore two
more battalions of Marines and to increase support
forces in South Vietnam. These orders were kept
secret.
The day before, when meeting with reporters,
Johnson was asked about any dramatic new
developments. He replied, "I know of no far-reaching
strategy that is being considered."

John A. McCone, director of the Central
Intelligence Agency, at the time sent a note to Rusk
saying the decision to commit troops "is correct only
if our air strikes against the North Vietnamese are
sufficiently heavy and damaging to hurt the North
Vietnamese.
"In effect we will find ourselves mired down in
combat in the jungle in a military effort that we
cannot win and from which we will have extreme
difficulty extricating ourselves," he argued.
In June, Gen. William C. Westmoreland, U.S.
commander in South Vietnam, called for 200,000
troops to hold off defeat long enough to permit an
American buildup.
"Swiftly and in an atmosphere of crisis," Johnson
gave his approval, according to the study, and ordered
the additional troops to South Vietnam in mid-July.
This decision was also concealed.
Popularity Halts Elections
The Post's first article dealt with the Eisenhower
administration's attempt to reduce the possibility
that the 1954 Geneva Conference would call for
nationwide elections. Intelligence reports showed that
elections throughout North and South Vietnam
would probably give victory to Ho Chi Minh.
The Geneva accords did call for an election in
1956, but none was allowed to take place. According
to the report it was Ngo Dinh Diem, far more than
the American government, who was responsible for
the elections' not taking place. Diem flatly refused
even to discuss the elections with the Communist
regime in Hamoi.
The second Post article reveals that the Johnson
Administration's strategists had little expectation that
the pauses in the bombing of North Vietnam in 1965
and 1968 would produce peace talks.
But the Johnson Administration policy-makers did
believe the halts Washington ordered from time to
time in its air attacks on North Vietnam "would help
placate domestic and world opinion," according to
the account.
"The Pentagon study discloses that some
strategists in the Johnson Administration planned to
use unproductive bombing pauses as a justification
for escalating the war.
"These planners regarded the lulls in bombing as a
'ratchet' to reduce tension and then intensify it, to
produce 'one more turn of the screw' in order to
'crack the enemy's resistance to negotiations,' the
report states."
Both the Times and the Post planned more
articles, but were prevented by injunctions handed
down by Federal Court. Although rulings so far have
been in favor of the newspapers, the United States is
appealing the decisions and further publication of the
documents has been put off indefinately.
