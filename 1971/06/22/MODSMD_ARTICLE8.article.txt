## China: Criticism, Self-Criticism 
### 
jeffweil

We should be ecstatic that China
exists. Its elimination of starvation,
most illiteracy, and the colonial
mentality when compared to the
continuing misery of India is enough to
make it deserve the American Left's
support.
Not only are China's achievements
good for Asia, but many are applicable
to America's problems: e.g., the
liberation of women, breakdown of
distinctions between mental and
manual labor, redress between town
and country, and the democratization
of industry.
Perhaps the most remarkablt
advances in China have been made in
medicine. Besides the vast
improvement in Chinese health
(syphilis has been stamped out), the
whole concept of medicine is different
in China. Medical knowledge is not
hoarded. The general populace is taught
as much medicine as possible, and
much paramedical training is given.
Basic attitudes and methods in
doctor-patient relations have been
revolutionized. For instance, a worker
injured in an industrial accident is
accompanied to the hospital by several
co-workers. Provisions are made for
them to stay beside their injured friend
for his psychological bolstering and to
act as mediators between him and the
doctor.
Grounds for Criticism
Yet we should not be Maoists. There
are grounds for criticism of China.
One of the bases for criticism is

China's handling of dissent. Certainly
Mao has allowed more criticism and
de-sanctification of the Party than
Russia has, and his treatment of
dissenters has been more humane. But
"better than Russia" should be no
criterion for the American Left. Liu
Shao-Chi has not been killed. But his
wife has. Furthermore, Liu has been
treated as a religious heretic rather than
as someone with a differing view on
political organization and economic
development..
The ending of the Hundred Flowers
Movement is a matter of controversy
between myself and Maoists, not
because of a disagreement on general
facts, but because of differences we
have in evaluating those facts. Mao
invited criticism of the government, but
when it went beyond criticizing
individual Party members for not being
good communists and challenged the
Party's right to power, the movement
was ended. Several Maoists have
asserted the correctness of this action:
"That's right, demanding that the
Communist Party relinquish power is
reactionary." or "There is a point
beyond which the criticism is no longer
constructive." It is illegitimate for the
CCP to decide on this point; if it is
doing a good job, the people will ignore
those who demand its surrender of
power. If not, it should lose power.
Circles of Assumptions
China is a one-party system. As
such, it is bound to be locked into
certain circles of assumptions and will

be vulnerable to everything from
Lysenkoist science to totalitarianism.
The cult of Mao has been carried to
ridiculuous extremes, as even the
Monthly Review editors have admitted.
Whereas his leadership has given the
Chinese a sense of self-reliance that
they never had in colonial times,
the dominance of Mao's personality in
all facets of Chinese life can be accused
of producing the same type of
alienation that Marx criticized religions
for producing.
This fact comes out in the attitude
toward education and the treatment of
intellectuals. Radio Canton reports the
trial of a father for neglecting the
instruction of his family in Mao
Tse-Tung thought. The public
confessions in the thought reform
campaigns sound like something out of
a Holy Roller service. Progress in
"resolving contradictions" among
intellectuals is measured in terms of
how many intellectuals embrace
Marxism-Leninism. This was explained
to me by: "Marxism-Leninism claims to
be true."
Economists, oven Marxist
economists like Joan Robinson and
Harry Magdoff, have discarded basic
theories of Marxism-Leninism such as
the Labor Theory of Value and the
Law of Rising Surplus. But were this
not true, Marxism-Leninism claim that
it is both true and a science is
untenable. You can't have both!
Sciences do not claim to be true; they
offer the best explanation for reality
that they can come up with for the
moment, and they welcome challenges
to their basic assumptions.
Not Great Thinker
I do not consider Mao a great
thinker. He begs questions and makes
countless statements without proo 1 12.
(For instance, he says that many-party
systems have been used to deceive the
people into thinking they have a choice
in decision making, but never explains
why multi-party systems are
intrinsically wrong.) But whatever the
value of his thought, it has been grossly
misapplied by the Left. "Correct ideas
come from social practice . . . alone"
has been used to reinforce the Left's
rampant anti-intellectualism; "Political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun"
has fed its rifle fetish.
The American and Western Left has
hurt itself in the past by becoming
ideologically bound to one country.
When Russia invaded Hungary,
thousands of Western communists
turned in their Party cards or were
forced to defend the party line
slavishly. Those who feel that China's
anti-imperialist past guarantees that
such an invasion would never be
duplicated by her should read Mao's
rationalization of the Hungarian

invasion at the end of "On the
Correct. . .Already we see many
Maoists bending over backwards to find
evidence that the East Pakistan struggle
is reactionary in order to defend China's
support of West Pakistan's genocidal
policy. I have heard at least half a
dozen times "We take our position on
Stalin from the Chinese Communist
Party."
All this at a time when the American
Left needs desperately to think for
itself.

Lysenkoist science to totalitarianism.
The cult of Mao has been carried to
ridiculuous extremes, as even the
Monthly Review editors have admitted.
Whereas his leadership has given the
Chinese a sense of self-reliance that
they never had in colonial times,
the dominance of Mao's personality in
all facets of Chinese life can be accused
of producing the same type of
alienation that Marx criticized religions
for producing.
This fact comes out in the attitude
toward education and the treatment of
intellectuals. Radio Canton reports the
trial of a father for neglecting the
instruction of his family in Mao
Tse-Tung thought. The public
confessions in the thought reform
campaigns sound like something out of
a Holy Roller service. Progress in
"resolving contradictions" among
intellectuals is measured in terms of
how many intellectuals embrace
Marxism-Leninism. This was explained
to me by: "Marxism-Leninism claims to
be true."
Economists, oven Marxist
economists like Joan Robinson and
Harry Magdoff, have discarded basic
theories of Marxism-Leninism such as
the Labor Theory of Value and the
Law of Rising Surplus. But were this
not true, Marxism-Leninism claim that
it is both true and a science is
untenable. You can't have both!
Sciences do not claim to be true; they
offer the best explanation for reality
that they can come up with for the
moment, and they welcome challenges
to their basic assumptions.
Not Great Thinker
I do not consider Mao a great
thinker. He begs questions and makes
countless statements without proo 1 12.
(For instance, he says that many-party
systems have been used to deceive the
people into thinking they have a choice
in decision making, but never explains
why multi-party systems are
intrinsically wrong.) But whatever the
value of his thought, it has been grossly
misapplied by the Left. "Correct ideas
come from social practice . . . alone"
has been used to reinforce the Left's
rampant anti-intellectualism; "Political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun"
has fed its rifle fetish.
The American and Western Left has
hurt itself in the past by becoming
ideologically bound to one country.
When Russia invaded Hungary,
thousands of Western communists
turned in their Party cards or were
forced to defend the party line
slavishly. Those who feel that China's
anti-imperialist past guarantees that
such an invasion would never be
duplicated by her should read Mao's
rationalization of the Hungarian

invasion at the end of "On the
Correct. . .Already we see many
Maoists bending over backwards to find
evidence that the East Pakistan struggle
is reactionary in order to defend China's
support of West Pakistan's genocidal
policy. I have heard at least half a
dozen times "We take our position on
Stalin from the Chinese Communist
Party."
All this at a time when the American
Left needs desperately to think for
itself.

We should be ecstatic that China
exists. Its elimination of starvation,
most illiteracy, and the colonial
mentality when compared to the
continuing misery of India is enough to
make it deserve the American Left's
support.
Not only are China's achievements
good for Asia, but many are applicable
to America's problems: e.g., the
liberation of women, breakdown of
distinctions between mental and
manual labor, redress between town
and country, and the democratization
of industry.
Perhaps the most remarkablt
advances in China have been made in
medicine. Besides the vast
improvement in Chinese health
(syphilis has been stamped out), the
whole concept of medicine is different
in China. Medical knowledge is not
hoarded. The general populace is taught
as much medicine as possible, and
much paramedical training is given.
Basic attitudes and methods in
doctor-patient relations have been
revolutionized. For instance, a worker
injured in an industrial accident is
accompanied to the hospital by several
co-workers. Provisions are made for
them to stay beside their injured friend
for his psychological bolstering and to
act as mediators between him and the
doctor.
Grounds for Criticism
Yet we should not be Maoists. There
are grounds for criticism of China.
One of the bases for criticism is

China's handling of dissent. Certainly
Mao has allowed more criticism and
de-sanctification of the Party than
Russia has, and his treatment of
dissenters has been more humane. But
"better than Russia" should be no
criterion for the American Left. Liu
Shao-Chi has not been killed. But his
wife has. Furthermore, Liu has been
treated as a religious heretic rather than
as someone with a differing view on
political organization and economic
development..
The ending of the Hundred Flowers
Movement is a matter of controversy
between myself and Maoists, not
because of a disagreement on general
facts, but because of differences we
have in evaluating those facts. Mao
invited criticism of the government, but
when it went beyond criticizing
individual Party members for not being
good communists and challenged the
Party's right to power, the movement
was ended. Several Maoists have
asserted the correctness of this action:
"That's right, demanding that the
Communist Party relinquish power is
reactionary." or "There is a point
beyond which the criticism is no longer
constructive." It is illegitimate for the
CCP to decide on this point; if it is
doing a good job, the people will ignore
those who demand its surrender of
power. If not, it should lose power.
Circles of Assumptions
China is a one-party system. As
such, it is bound to be locked into
certain circles of assumptions and will

be vulnerable to everything from
Lysenkoist science to totalitarianism.
The cult of Mao has been carried to
ridiculuous extremes, as even the
Monthly Review editors have admitted.

We should be ecstatic that China
exists. Its elimination of starvation,
most illiteracy, and the colonial
mentality when compared to the
continuing misery of India is enough to
make it deserve the American Left's
support.
Not only are China's achievements
good for Asia, but many are applicable
to America's problems: e.g., the
liberation of women, breakdown of
distinctions between mental and
manual labor, redress between town
and country, and the democratization
of industry.
Perhaps the most remarkablt
advances in China have been made in
medicine. Besides the vast
improvement in Chinese health
(syphilis has been stamped out), the
whole concept of medicine is different
in China. Medical knowledge is not
hoarded. The general populace is taught
as much medicine as possible, and
much paramedical training is given.
Basic attitudes and methods in
doctor-patient relations have been
revolutionized. For instance, a worker
injured in an industrial accident is
accompanied to the hospital by several
co-workers. Provisions are made for
them to stay beside their injured friend
for his psychological bolstering and to
act as mediators between him and the
doctor.
Grounds for Criticism
Yet we should not be Maoists. There
are grounds for criticism of China.
One of the bases for criticism is

China's handling of dissent. Certainly
Mao has allowed more criticism and
de-sanctification of the Party than
Russia has, and his treatment of
dissenters has been more humane. But
"better than Russia" should be no
criterion for the American Left. Liu
Shao-Chi has not been killed. But his
wife has. Furthermore, Liu has been
treated as a religious heretic rather than
as someone with a differing view on
political organization and economic
development..
The ending of the Hundred Flowers
Movement is a matter of controversy
between myself and Maoists, not
because of a disagreement on general
facts, but because of differences we
have in evaluating those facts. Mao
invited criticism of the government, but
when it went beyond criticizing
individual Party members for not being
good communists and challenged the
Party's right to power, the movement
was ended. Several Maoists have
asserted the correctness of this action:
"That's right, demanding that the
Communist Party relinquish power is
reactionary." or "There is a point
beyond which the criticism is no longer
constructive." It is illegitimate for the
CCP to decide on this point; if it is
doing a good job, the people will ignore
those who demand its surrender of
power. If not, it should lose power.
Circles of Assumptions
China is a one-party system. As
such, it is bound to be locked into
certain circles of assumptions and will

be vulnerable to everything from
Lysenkoist science to totalitarianism.
The cult of Mao has been carried to
ridiculuous extremes, as even the
Monthly Review editors have admitted.
Whereas his leadership has given the
Chinese a sense of self-reliance that
they never had in colonial times,
the dominance of Mao's personality in
all facets of Chinese life can be accused
of producing the same type of
alienation that Marx criticized religions
for producing.
This fact comes out in the attitude
toward education and the treatment of
intellectuals. Radio Canton reports the
trial of a father for neglecting the
instruction of his family in Mao
Tse-Tung thought. The public
confessions in the thought reform
campaigns sound like something out of
a Holy Roller service. Progress in
"resolving contradictions" among
intellectuals is measured in terms of
how many intellectuals embrace
Marxism-Leninism. This was explained
to me by: "Marxism-Leninism claims to
be true."
Economists, oven Marxist
economists like Joan Robinson and
Harry Magdoff, have discarded basic
theories of Marxism-Leninism such as
the Labor Theory of Value and the
Law of Rising Surplus. But were this
not true, Marxism-Leninism claim that
it is both true and a science is
untenable. You can't have both!
Sciences do not claim to be true; they
offer the best explanation for reality
that they can come up with for the
moment, and they welcome challenges
to their basic assumptions.
Not Great Thinker
I do not consider Mao a great
thinker. He begs questions and makes
countless statements without proo 1 12.
(For instance, he says that many-party
systems have been used to deceive the
people into thinking they have a choice
in decision making, but never explains
why multi-party systems are
intrinsically wrong.) But whatever the
value of his thought, it has been grossly
misapplied by the Left. "Correct ideas
come from social practice . . . alone"
has been used to reinforce the Left's
rampant anti-intellectualism; "Political
power grows out of the barrel of a gun"
has fed its rifle fetish.
The American and Western Left has
hurt itself in the past by becoming
ideologically bound to one country.
When Russia invaded Hungary,
thousands of Western communists
turned in their Party cards or were
forced to defend the party line
slavishly. Those who feel that China's
anti-imperialist past guarantees that
such an invasion would never be
duplicated by her should read Mao's
rationalization of the Hungarian

invasion at the end of "On the
Correct. . .Already we see many
Maoists bending over backwards to find
evidence that the East Pakistan struggle
is reactionary in order to defend China's
support of West Pakistan's genocidal
policy. I have heard at least half a
dozen times "We take our position on
Stalin from the Chinese Communist
Party."
