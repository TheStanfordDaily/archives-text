# Faculty, Staff Protest Workers' Dismissal
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
About 50 persons who hold a
brief, peaceful sit-in in Personnel
Director Robert Nelson's office
at Enema Hall Wednesday vowed
to return today. The group is
protesting the firing of five
employees for their alleged par
ticipation in the April 9 Hospital
sit-in.
The protestors, who left Nel
son's office saying they would
return in 18 hours, have schedul
ed a noon rally today in front of
Encina. A guerilla theatre, which
performed Wednesday, will be
back again today. According to
John Dolly, one of those fired,
the purpose of the rally is to
pressure the administration into
reinstating the workers.
Several faculty members also

reacted to the firings with
considerable criticism at a
special meeting yesterday with
Provost and Acting President
William Miller. The faculty mem
bers threatened legal action if
the workers are not reinstated.
Miller responded later yesterday
by holding the dismissals.
Three criticisms have been
leveled against the administra
tion on procedural grounds.
First, the faculty members and
dismissed employees question
the administration for having
given the fired workers only one
days notice. The workers also
complain of the timing of the
firings, arguing that it's been 11
weeks since the sit-in and that
they are being put in double
jeopardy because they are al
ready facing criminal proceed
ings for the same incident.
Finally, faculty members have
complained that the University
has no right to fire an employee
without the permission of the
faculty. They also argue that
dismissal which is based on
political reasons and not job
performance has a chilling effect
on future hiring.
Provost Miller and Nelson
have both issued statements
concerning the dismissals. (See

page nine for complete text of
the statements.) Said Nelson,
The University was not acting
as a law enforcement agency,
but as an employer making
judgements about the conduct
which it deemed unacceptable
on the part of the employees."
Responding to the complaints
of several faculty members.
Miller said, "I have determined
that the procedures employed
were consistent with our policy,
and that they are adequate for
these cases."
A statement given to Miller
signed by 12 faculty members,
and according to genetics Profes
sor Leonard Her/enberg, "sup
ported by ten more," stated,
"We urge the immediate rein
statement of these employees at
least until after their court trials,
when they could properly re
spond to University charges
without ceding First and Fifth
Amendment rights.
"These dismissals violate hu
man and constitutional rights of
employees and the rights of
faculty members. It is as subver
sive of academic freedom for an
outside administrative person to
fire a member of a laboratory as
it would be for such a person to

insist on the hiring of an
individual. Both courses of ac
tion are tantamount to dictating
the research itself."
At a press conference after
their meeting with Miller several
faculty members indicated they
were considering legal action
against the University including
possibly a restraining order.
Said Avram Goldstein of
pharmacology, "That's what it
will come to unless there is a
very prompt reversal . . . We will
take every step we can to insure
our legal rights."
Said Hertzenberg, "This firing
without consultation of the
employee's supervisor is totally
unacceptable. I have total re
sponsibility for these research
activities (in the genetics labora
tory when 1 Dolly worked). In
this case my research certainly
has been jeopardized."
Although none of the fired
workers is from his department,
Goldstein expressed a similar
complaint. "The rights of all
faculty members, particularly
those with research projects, has
been challenged. My whole re
search is in jeopardy because of
these actions ... I have a respon
sibility to the National Institute
of Health in my research. 1 don't
think the University has a right
to step in and disrupt that
relationship certainly not with

out adequate consultation and
discussion. This is a Sword of
Daniacles hanging over all of
us."
Provost Miller, responding to
the faculty criticisms, told the
Daily, "the double jeopardy
argument is not a valid point,
since it's not criminal punish
ment involved in this case, it's
not a real double jeopardy."
He also said that the firings
were "not a political action."
The firings were due to "their
behavior," he said. "It's the
action, for whatever reason, not
the politics. The same action for
other reasons would be just as
disruptive."
Miller also said that the
workers "knew well in advance"
that an investigation was going
on, and that they might be
dismissed.
Nelson, in an interview with
the Daily, stated that the timing
of the firings was not arbitrary,
but in fact had followed an
extensive investigation which
had jus! been completed, lie also
said that although usually staff is
given a two week notice of
dismissal, "in this case one day
notict with two weeks pay
seemed a better way to handle
the situation." He said that
questions of the possibility of
interruption at the work station
and whether there would be full
working led to the decision.

Responding to an accusation
by Satisky that the one day
notice was intended to allow the
University to immediately add
their names to an injunction
barring people from campus.
Nelson said, "That's nonsense."
In a related development 35
workers who filed a class griev
ance with Nelson on June 11
received letters yesterday stating
that in Nelson's view, "a griev
ance docs not exist."
The workers had charged
Nelson, President Lyman, and
Miller, with harrassing and intim
idating all University employees
by threatening to fire five
workers for "unacceptable be
havior on their own time,
without a hearing, in such a way
as to prevent employees from
organizing to express their inter
ests and achieve their rights."
'Ihe workers charged that
Nelson "has shown he will use
his authority arbitrarily in vio
lating even his own procedures."
They quote guide memo 22.10
as saving, "a grievance exists
whenever an employee believes
he has been treated improperly
or unfairly. . .
Nelson replvs that "there is
no such thing as a class griev
ance" and that an employee has
to show individually that he has
a grievance and define what type
of corrective action he wants.
"You have got to have some
thing specific to work with in
these circumstances."
