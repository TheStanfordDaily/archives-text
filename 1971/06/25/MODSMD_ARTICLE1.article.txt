# Faculty, Staff Protest Workers' Dismissal
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
About 50 persons who hold a
brief, peaceful sit-in in Personnel
Director Robert Nelson's office
at Enema Hall Wednesday vowed
to return today. The group is
protesting the firing of five
employees for their alleged par
ticipation in the April 9 Hospital
sit-in.
The protestors, who left Nel
son's office saying they would
return in 18 hours, have schedul
ed a noon rally today in front of
Encina. A guerilla theatre, which
performed Wednesday, will be
back again today. According to
John Dolly, one of those fired,
the purpose of the rally is to
pressure the administration into
reinstating the workers.
Several faculty members also

reacted to the firings with
considerable criticism at a
special meeting yesterday with
Provost and Acting President
William Miller. The faculty mem
bers threatened legal action if
the workers are not reinstated.
Miller responded later yesterday
by holding the dismissals.
Three criticisms have been
leveled against the administra
tion on procedural grounds.
First, the faculty members and
dismissed employees question
the administration for having
given the fired workers only one
days notice. The workers also
complain of the timing of the
firings, arguing that it's been 11
weeks since the sit-in and that
they are being put in double
jeopardy because they are al
ready facing criminal proceed
ings for the same incident.
Finally, faculty members have
complained that the University
has no right to fire an employee
without the permission of the
faculty. They also argue that
dismissal which is based on
political reasons and not job
performance has a chilling effect
on future hiring.
Provost Miller and Nelson
have both issued statements
concerning the dismissals. (See

page nine for complete text of
the statements.) Said Nelson,
The University was not acting
as a law enforcement agency,
but as an employer making
judgements about the conduct
which it deemed unacceptable
on the part of the employees."
Responding to the complaints
of several faculty members.
Miller said, "I have determined
that the procedures employed
were consistent with our policy,
and that they are adequate for
these cases."
A statement given to Miller
signed by 12 faculty members,
and according to genetics Profes
sor Leonard Her/enberg, "sup
ported by ten more," stated,
"We urge the immediate rein
statement of these employees at
least until after their court trials,
when they could properly re
spond to University charges
without ceding First and Fifth
Amendment rights.
"These dismissals violate hu
man and constitutional rights of
employees and the rights of
faculty members. It is as subver
sive of academic freedom for an
outside administrative person to
fire a member of a laboratory as
it would be for such a person to
