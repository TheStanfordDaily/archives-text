# Fine Acting Can't Save 'The Beard'
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
No one from the Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Department
vice squad showed up at
Wednesday night's premiere of
"The Beard." And neither did
many other people. A small
gathering of around 50,
including many familiar faces
from the Drama Department,
were on hand for the first
performance of Michael
McClure's controversial plav,
which has more than once ended
with the arrest of the cast.
But the show went on with
hardly any sighs of shock from
the audience. A few years have
passed since McClure's play first
ran into legal problems (back in
the mid-sixties) and things are a
bit more permissive, to say the
least.
No one seemed upset over the
constant stream of verbal
obscenities, whose quantity
must set some sort of record.
But at least one person kept
falling asleep as some audience
members seemed a bit bored at
the repetitive slang.
Two Characters
The play features only two
charactersâ€”Jean Harlow and
Billy the Kid. The single act
takes place in Eternity and is
concerned with the verbal, and
later the physical contact
between the sex symbol and the
famous western bandit.
The verbal battle between the
two includes frequent
philosophical statements about
how destiny is "doing what you
want to do" and how each of
the characters is "divine".
Harlow constantly talks about
how no one will be able to pry
secrets from her until they know
the "real her".
The dialogue is supplemented
by physical action which leads
to the play's climax. First Billy
bites Jean's stockinged foot,
causing it to bleed, but only
after she squeezes it. Later she
fondles his boots while looking
at the rainbow Billy claims they
reflect.
As the lights dim, the final

physical contact occurs. To look
at it from a strictly legalistic
viewpoint, there is simulated a
sexual act which in many states
could conceivably lead to the
arrest of a man and his wife.
Try Copenhagen?
I don't want to ruin the fun
of those who enjoy observing
such things, so l will say no
more about it, except that I
hope no one spends $2.00
expecting any incredibly
titillating experience. If that's
your bag, try the Copenhagen
Theater instead.
There is more to the play
then the final moments which
led to its receiving national
publicity. There are some valid
points presented. Unfortunately
the continuity of them for this
reviewer was lost amidst a lot of
the repetitive, choice language.
For someone who is willing

to see it more than once, there
might eventually be some sort of
moving theatrical experience.
Personally, I don't know if I'd
want to sit through any more
performances to find out.
Not Boring
However, I did not find the
play at all boring. And this is
due mainly to the outstanding
performances of the cast
members, Elizabeth Cole and
Peter Silbert. They are both
highly talented performers. A
two-character play is quite a test
for any actors, and Cole and
Silbert come off extremely well.
Both of their character
izations work ncraly flawlessly.
Cole comes off as the sexy
starlet Harlow was. And Silbert
is the rough, harsh Western man
that Billy the Kid must have
been.
Silbert and Cole have long

lists of acting credits behind
them and their performances in
"The Beard" should add large
plusses to evaluations of their
ability. There was hardly a
moment in the play when they
lost my attention. Just to see
such fine acting ability may be
reason enough to go.
Good Directing
Leo Greene, who will be on
the drama faculty this fall,
directed the production. As with
the actors, he has done a good
job with less than perfect
material. The make-up and
costume work is good, as is the
set design and lighting.
Hopefully the added ability
all those concerned with the
production will come away with
after 15 performances can
quickly be directed into another
dramatic work. One fears that
without the final scene of his

"piece dc resistance," McClure
might never have gotten any sort
of publicity. It wouldn't have
been much of a loss.
Performances in the Little
Theater will continue tonight
and tommorrow night, and then
again June 30, July 1, 2, 3, 8, 9,
10, 14, 15, 16 and 17, all at
8:00.
