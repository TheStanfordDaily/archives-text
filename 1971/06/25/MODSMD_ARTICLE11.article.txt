# Doctor Finds Humor No Laughing Matter
## 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Have you heard about the
bird that flies upside-down so
that if a hunter shoots him, he'll
fall up?
If you smiled when you read
that, you have a rare apprecia
tion for old George Burns jokes.
If you laughed, you probably
need a long vacation.
But regardless of your rea<_
tion you were displaying a sense
of humor, an appreciation of the
paradox inherent in the joke, the
idea that a bird will fall up
merely because it is flying
upside-down. As far as anyone
knows, human beings are the
only animals who can appreciate
a "joke"; they are the only
animals that exhibit a mirthful
smile; and, with the exception of
the chimpanzees and gorillas,
they are the only animals that
laugh.
Dr. William F. Fry, Jr., a
Clinical Associate Professor of
Psychiatry at the Stanford Medi
cal School, has been studying
humor for the last two decades.
(His 1963 book. Sweet Madness,
is now in its second printing. Dr.
Fry feels that humor, and the
particular kind of humor assoc
iated with mirth, is one of the
least appreciated of human ex
periences.
Taken For Granted
"I think that this part of life
is something that we generally
take more or less for granted,"
says Dr. Fry. "In the Classic
Period of Greece and Rome the
comic theater was as respected
as the tragic, and the symbols of
mirth were granted as much
authority and as much respect as
the symbols of tragedy.
"But with the rise of the
Judeo-Christian tradition, those
areas of life which were oriented
towards joy and experiencing of
mirth began to be looked upon
as being anti-Church and anti
-moralistic tradition.
"As we get into our present
era ... we don't look on laugh
ter as being an expression of evil
in man, we don't look upon
comedy in the theater as being
sinful, but we do look on it as
being less important or less
significant than those things
which have to do with the
'serious' parts of life."
Scientists Reticent
Dr. Fry is aware of a
reticence of scientists when it
comes to studying humor.
"Scientists really have a recog
nition of the power of humor
and its effectiveness; it's some
thing that's difficult to control,
and so it's something that
creates a certain amount of
anxiety. One of the ways of
handling it is to ignore it,
pretend it isn't there. Another
way, of course, is to deride it,
minimize its significance.
"So I think that the
reaction of what I've called the
Scientific Sourpuss is based on
awe, and a sort of a fearful awe
as well."
The reluctance of the scientif
ic community to treat humor
seriously has made it difficult
for Dr. Fry to obtain funding for
his studies. He has been depen
dent upon the generosity of two
local electronics firms (Hew
lett-Packard and Beckman In
struments) for equipment, and
upon the cooperation of the
University.

Dr. Fry's studies in humor
began almost two decades ago.
In order for scientific work to be
objective, it is important that
the observed variables lend
themselves to quantification. Dr.
Fry's early work soon ran into
problems of "measuring" hu
mor. (How funny was that joke?
Was it very funny, or just a little
funny? Rank its funniness on a
scale from one to ten).
In an attempt to measure
more readily quantifiable para
meters, Dr. Fry turned his
attention to the study of the
body's reaction to laughter.
"The studies conducted so far
have included an investigation of
the effects of mirth on the heart
rate and the electrocardiagram;"
says Dr. Fry, "We also have
studied laughter as a respiratory
phenomenon, and have examin
ed the effects of mirthful laugh-

ter on the oxygen saturation
levels of the peripheral blood.
Complete Disruption
"The usual initial component
of laughter is an abrupt, strong
expiration. This initial expira
tion can intervene at any point
of the normal respiratory cycle.
There is no apparent respiratory
preparation for the onset of
laughter. Laughter causes a com
plete disruption of the normal
respiratory cycle.
"Following the initial respira
tion, laughter consists of varying
mixtures of expiration, inspira
tion, and interval pausing.
"Tachycardia (increase in
heart rate) was found to be
associated with laughter. The
heart rate increase correlates
directly with duration and inten
sity of the laughter; rates of over

120 were found with more
prolonged and/or more intense
laughter."
Chimps Laugh
Dr. Fry and his colleagues
have found that chimpanzees
also laugh- they liketo be tickled.
And at least one other observor
( Dian Fossey of Cambridge Uni
versity) has reported witnessing
gorillas in the wild tickling each
other.
Dr. Fry notes that "Humor is
documented as a part of the
human experience during at least
the past 5,000 years. How much
further down the tree mirth goes
is a matter of conjecture, with
some hint coming from its
consistent impact on several
basic physiologic systems which
must have had origin at the
beginning of mammalian life, at
least."

Then 1 is reason to believe that
a very common primate behav
ior, the social grimace, may be
related to the human smile. The
social grimace is used by
non-human primates when they
are faced with an ambivalent
situation, one in which there is a
combination of security and
threat.
Hostile Stranger
The human smile is often
used under the same circumstan
ces. (Upon meeting a stranger,
one generally smiles until it is
determined whether or not the
stranger is hostile.)
The element that transforms
the chimpanzee's social grimace
or the human smile into an
expression of mirth is the
concept of play, "f'lav is one of
the basic forms of behavior in

the mammalian world," says Dr.
Fry. "And the heart of play is
the establishment of a paradox."
And the essential characteris
tic of paradox is ambivalence.
Thus a human smile may also
represent the reaction to the
ambivalence of a "joke," which is
a paradox presented within what
Dr. Fry calls a "play frame."
Common Descendent
Dr. Fry is careful to point out
that the consideration of a
common progenitor for the
social grimace of the primate
and the human smile is specula
tive. "But," he says,"it does
touch rather resoundingly and
intriguingly on the question of a
dynamic relationship between
humor, hostility and anxietyâ€”a
question which has received over
the years much attention in
human psychology."
Dr. Fry also speculates upon
the social significance of laugh
ter and mirth. "Laughter," he
says, "can be thought of as being
a group and an individual exper
ience, in the sense that when
you have a group of people
laughing together, it's sort of a

chorus. It's like music, except
that each person has his indivi
dual laugh.
"You have a joining together
of many different voices and
many different songs, but these
voices and songs are in unison,
and it's a unifying experience.
"Individual Experience"
"Rut also, laughter in mirth
can be an individual experience
in the sense that it is so
different, one laugh is different
from the other.
"Laughter is the one common
vocal experience that is not
verbal in the way we live in the
present time. It's the one com
mon vigorous vocalization that
human beings have that's an
indication of individuality, an
indication of selfness.
"A human being is announc
ing his personal conquest of the
enigma of the joke, the conun
drum. the question that has been
raised in his mind by bringing
these elements together in the
joke, and he suddenly gets the
moment of insight when the
punch line comes, and he bursts
out into laughter!"

IT ONLY HURTS WHEN I LAUGH The discovery that chimps
like to be tickled has added a new dimension to the role that
laughter plays in human behavior. But although chimps and gorillas
laugh when tickled, humans are the only animals with a "sense of
humor," the ability to appreciate a "joke."
