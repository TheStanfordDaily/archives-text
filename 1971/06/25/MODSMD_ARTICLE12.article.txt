# Work-Study Program Initiated
## 
### DICK GEIKIE 
The Stanford University Hos
pital has launched the develop
ment of a broad work-study
program to "qualify and train
interested employees for job
advancement within the hospi
tal."
The program, offers class
room education for employees
desiring instruction in English,
preparation for the California
General Educational Develop
ment test (GED), and on-the-job
training for hospital related jobs.
Reorganization
"Basically, this is a reorgani
zation and broadening of pre
vious education and training
courses," said Dr. Thomas Gon
da, hospital director. "This con
solidated program is more suited
to the needs of the hospital as
well as to the needs of the
individual employees."
The program has been design
ed such that employees may
enter at any of the three levels
conversational English, GED or
on-the-job training â€” depending
on their previous education.
Employees who complete the
conversational English instruc
tion or who already possess
proficiency in English may take
the GED, which is equivalent to
a high school diploma. Those
with high school diplomas or
passing grades in the GED may
then start any one of four areas

of concentration - nursing, cleri
cal, science or engineering.
Preliminary Counseling
Any employee entering on
the-job training would first be
counseled to determine where he
would be best suited. Having
decided on one particular area,
he would start preliminary
courses at the hospital during
working hours. Depending on
desire and ability, an employee
may advance to the position of
physical or occupational thera
pist, registered nurse, accounting
assistant or union grade shop
worker.
Tony Rodriguez, recently
appointed Work-Study Director,
says of the program, "All our
PHOTOGRAPHERS
Have you ever wanted to
impose your particular distorted
world-view on people other than
your bored family and friends?
The Summer Daily photo de
partment invites you to be
expansionary. We need trigger
happy photographers to expose
campus happenings. The only
requirement is that you have a
camera-we'll supply all the
35mm film you need. Interest

photography office.

classes will be tailored to meet
the specific needs of the hospi
tal, so we'll be producing our
own highly-trained labor force.
In general, no employee will
enter a class without first having
a job committed to him."
Scholarship Program
Upper level courses will be
offered at local colleges, and
many minority medical students
have offered their services as
tutors. Whenever possible, these
courses will be arranged so that
employees will be paid for their
time in class. Rodriguez wants to
eventually initiate a scholarship
program, "which would be a
first in a hospital work-study
program. All scholarships would

be set up on a need basis and
there would be a tremendous
amount of counseling involved."
Potential and Need
"While we're getting off the
ground our classes will be very
small," Rodriguez said. "Selec
tion [for the upper level study
programs | will be based on
potential and need. But even
tually we hope to open the
program up to all interested
employees, with order of selec
tion on a need basis."
In order to finalize many
arrangements, and give English
and GED employees time to
catch up, a target date of
September 1 has been set for the
implementation of the third

level on-the-job training. Accord
ing to Director Rodriguez, there
is also a possibility of obtaining
federal funding for the program.
BAC Backing
Nadine Ellis, secretary and
official spokeswoman for the
Black Advisory Committee
(BAC), said that the Work-Study
program has the complete back
ing of the BAC. "We fully
support the program and will
work to make it a success," said
Ellis.
Ellis said that Mr. Martin
Hudson, BAC Chairman, "has
been working and meeting with
Rodriguez so that the Blacks and
Browns may act as one in the
program."
