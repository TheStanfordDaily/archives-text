# Sexist Suit In Court
## 
### DEBBY STORZ 
A suit, charging sexual and
racial discrimination by Stan
ford, will be aired in court
today.
The plaintiffs in the suit are
Linda Grouse, a hospital worker
and spokesman for the United
Front Against Racist and Politi
cal Firings, and Dr. Nancy Cross
of Menlo Park.
Dr. Cross stated in the com
plaint, "sex-racist policies and
conduct herein involved touch
and bend toward deficits in
greatness and cascade, over dec
ades unending, at the University,
along the peninsula, and all over

the world- wherever the enor
mous influence of Stanford
University is felt."
The 11:00 a.m. hearing in the
San Francisco Federal Building
will be presided over by Judge
Oliver J. Carter.
Originally the case was heard
by Judge John S. Mclnerny in
Palo Alto Superior Court. On
May 11, U.S. Attorney James L.
Kidgewav, representing the De
partment of Health. Education,
and Welfare, filed a petition to
remove the case to the U.S.
District Court.
The action was then filed
with Judge Robert F. Peckham,
who disqualified himself because

he is a 1941 graduate of
Stanford and also received a law
degree in 1945.
If the case goes on to the
Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit in San Francisco it is
possible that the presiding judge
would be Ben C. Duniway, a
1931 graduate of Stanford Uni
versity Law School and a mem
ber of the Board of Trustees of
Stanford since 1962.
