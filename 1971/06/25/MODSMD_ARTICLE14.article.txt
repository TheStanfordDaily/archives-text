Judge Frank Fiombo, who

cation. Judge Piombo observed
that, it's not the strongest
evidence of identification, but it
is enough to decide there is
probable cause- weak as it is,
right at the borderline." King
and Laury an 1 similar in appear
ance.
Late Wednesday night, fol
lowing the court decision, King
was arrested at the office of the
Black Liberation Front in East
