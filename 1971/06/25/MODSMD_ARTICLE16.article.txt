Following is the text of a statement issued Thursday, June
24, by Robert Nelson, Stan ford University direetor of person
nel and employee relations, eoneerning the dismissal of Jive
University employees:
June 24, l l )7l
In discharging five employees for participation in the occu
pation of the administrative offices of the Stanford Hospital
on April 1 71, the University was not acting as a law
enforcement agency but as an employer making judgments
about conduct which it deemed unacceptable on the of
the employees. This distinction is central to any attempt to
understand the issues involved. To put the matter even more
sharply, the University has not charged any of these employees
with committing a crime, nor has it alleged that the conduct
which serves as the basis for dismissal constitutes a crime. The
live persons involved have not been dismissed because of any
allegations that any of them committed trespass, assaulted a
police officer, or engaged in any other criminal act. Nor is the
asserted political content of their acts at issue. They have been
dismissed simply and solely for participating in the occupation
of the administrative offices of the Stanford University Hos
pital on Aprill97l, and which in the University's judgment,
makes these persons unsuitable for further employment in the
University.
It is important to understand this point because it is easy to
be misled into thinking that this employment action is simply
another statement of criminal charges already pending against
these individuals. It is not. The two overlap on!, in the sense
that the same set of events produced conduct which the State
believes chargeable under criminal statues, and conduct which
demonstrated unsuitability for continued employment at Stan
ford. These were separate actions based on independent in
quiries taken in discharge of different responsibilities.
I have made this point at some length in order to shed light
on the demand that the University delay its proceedings until
criminal charges are disposed of in order that the former not
"jeopardize'" an individual's defense against the latter. The
University's unwillingness to delay action on employees whose
conduct it deems unacceptable until the criminal courts have
completed action on a different set of charges is consistent
with well established practice in a variety of circumstances in
the law. Far from being an unusual act, it follows the general
rule in cases where cirminal and civil actions result from a
single set of events. To argue otherwise is to say that no
private party can remedy a wrong against it in a timely manner
if the wrong is alleged by the State to involve criminal conduct
or, indeed, if the individual who committed the act believes
that answering for it might make him liable to criminal
charges. That is an untenable position.
Each of these individuals was offered the opportunity to
respond to the evidence, and provide any additional informa
tion that would bear on this case.
The five persons involved have been advised in writing that
they are entitled to a hearing if they believe that they have
been treated improperly or unfairly. In that hearing they may
challenge the evidence on which the action against them is
based, as well as the interpretation of University policy on
which it rests. That is their proper course of action if they
believe that they have been unfairly treated.

tion that would bear on this case.
The five persons involved have been advised in writing that
they are entitled to a hearing if they believe that they have
been treated improperly or unfairly. In that hearing they may
challenge the evidence on which the action against them is
based, as well as the interpretation of University policy on
which it rests. That is their proper course of action if they
believe that they have been unfairly treated.
Following is the text of a statement issued Thursday, June
24, by Robert Nelson, Stan ford University direetor of person
nel and employee relations, eoneerning the dismissal of Jive
University employees:
June 24, l l )7l
In discharging five employees for participation in the occu
pation of the administrative offices of the Stanford Hospital
on April 1 71, the University was not acting as a law
enforcement agency but as an employer making judgments
about conduct which it deemed unacceptable on the of
the employees. This distinction is central to any attempt to
understand the issues involved. To put the matter even more
sharply, the University has not charged any of these employees
with committing a crime, nor has it alleged that the conduct
which serves as the basis for dismissal constitutes a crime. The
live persons involved have not been dismissed because of any
allegations that any of them committed trespass, assaulted a
police officer, or engaged in any other criminal act. Nor is the
asserted political content of their acts at issue. They have been
dismissed simply and solely for participating in the occupation
of the administrative offices of the Stanford University Hos
pital on Aprill97l, and which in the University's judgment,
makes these persons unsuitable for further employment in the
University.
It is important to understand this point because it is easy to
be misled into thinking that this employment action is simply
another statement of criminal charges already pending against
these individuals. It is not. The two overlap on!, in the sense
that the same set of events produced conduct which the State
believes chargeable under criminal statues, and conduct which
demonstrated unsuitability for continued employment at Stan
ford. These were separate actions based on independent in
quiries taken in discharge of different responsibilities.
I have made this point at some length in order to shed light
on the demand that the University delay its proceedings until
criminal charges are disposed of in order that the former not
"jeopardize'" an individual's defense against the latter. The
University's unwillingness to delay action on employees whose
conduct it deems unacceptable until the criminal courts have
completed action on a different set of charges is consistent
with well established practice in a variety of circumstances in
the law. Far from being an unusual act, it follows the general
rule in cases where cirminal and civil actions result from a
single set of events. To argue otherwise is to say that no
private party can remedy a wrong against it in a timely manner
if the wrong is alleged by the State to involve criminal conduct
or, indeed, if the individual who committed the act believes
that answering for it might make him liable to criminal
charges. That is an untenable position.
Each of these individuals was offered the opportunity to
respond to the evidence, and provide any additional informa
tion that would bear on this case.
