Chief Selection
The selection of a new
Stanford police chief and a
reevaluation of the present role
of the Stanford Police Depart
ment have been set as the main
goals of a committee about to be
chosen.
According to Fred Glover,
special assistant to President
Lyman, the committee will be
composed of three members of
the faculty, three members of
the staff, three students and one
Stanford homeowner. It will
investigate the possibility of
changing the status of the
Stanford policemen from secur
ity guards to full police officers.
Under California law, Stan
ford policemen and other private
security forces do not have the
power of arrest. A bill presently
before the state legislature
would repeal that law.

Daily room rates at Stanford
Hospital will be increased be
ginning July 1.

Area residents will be charged
$64.50 daily for medical and
surgical ward rooms, while semi
private rooms will cost $70.50 a
day. The cost of private rooms
will be hiked to $79.50.
The new room rates represent
an overall increase of about four
dollars.

BAC Election
The black non-professional
workers at Stanford Hospital
elected a Black Advisory
Committee (8.A.C.) last week to
act as their representative body
before the hospital
administration.
Nine representatives were
elected from the 317 black
employees with only 77
employees voting. The low turn
out, according to several black
workers polled, was due to lack
of publicity. Even with the low
| turn out, two black workers,
[ Doris Hendrix and John Bowers,
expressed complete faith in the
j committee's representativeness,
i Mr. Bower affirmed that, "We
| are very happy with those
elected and hope all the black

workers will support the B.A.C.
and make it work."
At their first meeting, held
June 18, the B.A.C. appointed
Martin Hudson chairman and
James Cheatham vice chairman.
The Affirmative Action Program
was listed as one of the B.A.C.'s

chief priorities. Nadine Ellis,
B.A.C. Secretary', preferred not
to comment on the election at
this time. She did mention that
the B.A.C. was meeting again of
Wednesday and might have more
information concerning B.A.C.
goals at that time.
