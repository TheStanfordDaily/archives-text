# Colleges Experience Rift Over Venceremos Policies
## 
### ERIC ESPEN 
The split between Nairobi
end Venceremos colleges deep
ened this week after members of
the Board of Directors of Nairo
bi College failed to appear at a
meeting called by Venceremos
College.
Nairobi College maintains a
campus in predominantly black
East Palo Alto, and is adminis
tratively affiliated with Vencere
mos College, located in a pre
dominantly Chicano area of
Redwood City.
Directors of the Venceremos
campus voted unanimously to
reverse an August 13, 1970
board decision to separate the
two campuses, effective June 30,
1971.
According to staff member
Aaron Manganiello, the split
would mean that Venceremos
College may be cut off from
sharing $1 million in funding for
the Nairobi corporation. The
Nairobi board members, said
Manganiello, plan to give back
Venceremos College's share to
the Office of Education, princi
pal benefactor in the grant. This
would mean that Venceremos
College could lose funding for as
long as one year, and the
$344,000 ear-marked for stud
ent financial aid, teachers' salar
ies and operating expenses for
1971-72 would be sent back to
Washington.
Reasons given by Nairobi for
its ouster of Venceremos were

that Venceremos College has
insisted on criticizing the Ameri
can government and participa
ting in militant revolutionary
activities such as the Los Siete
and Stanford Hospital
demonstrations. Venceremos'
concentration on such commun
ity-oriented activities as the
People's Medical Center and
Eood Co-op is also a major
factor in the split. Nairobi insists
that education must be a non
partisan process and should
refrain from political action.
In line with Venceremos
College's militant political
stance, Manganiello, who is a
teacher of political education at
the "storefront" campus, said,
"One of the minimal require
ments for admission should be
that people must have served
time in jail for the movement.
This is to determine if they are
really serious or if they just want
the financial aid. Education is a
verb. It doesn't happen out of
the black lettering on a book but
from working with and integrat
ing yourself into the masses of
people."
"The Ruling Elite"
He termed the Board of
Trustees of the Nairobi corpora
tion "the ruling elite of East
Palo Alto" and said that Vence
remos College would take legal
action to fight the proposed
administrative decision to split
the two campuses.
Several aspects of corporation

law are involved. In order to
incorporate, state statutes re
quire that the two campuses
have $50,000 in assets. Each
must maintain this amount after
splitting in order to retain its
non-profit status and its Office
of Education funding. Vencere
mos would not be able to do
this, while whether Nairobi
could maintain its status on its
own is questionable.
At the August Board meetinr.
two votes were taken. First, t'ie
decision to split was passed, a:;d
then a decision to split the
funding 50-50 between the two
campuses passed. Now, Mangan
iello claims, Nairobi has decided
the first vote stands and refuses
to abide by the second, threaten
ing to return Venceremos Col
lege's funds to the government.
This provides a basis for Vence
remos' court action.
Controversy on Split
Another factor in the legal
proceedings will be the contro
versy over whether the decision
to split was simply an adminis
trative decision of the Nairobi
corporation or whether it invol
ved a decision to split the
corporation into two separate
corporate bodies. In the latter
case the funds would have to be
split between the two colleger. !f
the decision was an administra
tive one, then Nairobi legally
could return the funds marked
for the Venceremos campus to
the Office of Education.
