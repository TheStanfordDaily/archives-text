## Grad Tours China 
### JOHN MARKOFF 
Kim Woodard, a Stanford
graduate student in political
science, is one of 13 members of
(he Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars now touring the
Peoples Republic of China. The
CCAS Members, who will be in
China for one month, are the
first American scholars to enter
the Communist nation in 22
years. *
The group received its invitat
ion from the Chinese govern
ment on -June 7 and entered
China from Hong Kong on Tues
day. The majority of CCAS

members are graduate students
associated with universities in
the United States. They special
ize in Chinese studies and have
some skill in the Chinese lang
uage.
Woodward and his wife, Jud
ith, were both undergraduates at
Swarthmore College. They spent
1970 at the Stanford Center in
Taiwan studying Chinese. .Judith
is now studying at the Chinese
University in Hong Kong, and
Kim is doing research on his dis
sertation on Chinese foreign pol
icy. While attending Stanford,
Kim was vice-president of the

Midpeninsula Free University.
In a statement released in
Hong Kong on Wednesday,


FORBIDDEN PLEASURE Freak-out seekers have been storming
the fences of Manuel Piers' farmland to splash, swim, fish, and
l»e no rally Woodstock at Kelt Lake.
CCAS stated, "The group hopes
to visit rural communes, schools,
hospitals and factories to learn
first hand from the experience
of the people of the new China.
ITiey are grateful for this oppor
tunity to express friendship on a
people-to-people basis and will
carry with them a message of
mutual understanding and a
spirit of peace."
Upon their return to the

United States, the entourage of
seven men and six women plan
to publish their findings collect
ively. They are touring China un
accompanied by foreign news
men.
All of the group's members
had been studying the various as
pects of Chinese Ufa in Hong
Kong at the Universitie's Service
Center.
In an interview with the Daily'
earlier this week Mollie Coye, a
Stanford graduate student and
National CCAS Coordinator,
stated that scholars in CCAS,
"have watched with interest the
non-radical press coverage of this
event and find it interesting that
they fail to mention what CCAS
thinks is the most crucial aspect
of this invitation, that the first
scholars to enter China in 22
years are from the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars and
not from senatorial committees
and government China-watching
groups."
Three Years Old
Coye explained that the Com
mittee was formed three years
ago, "in protest over the un
willingness of the profession of
Asian scholars to take a stand
bearing responsibility for the
uses of their own research and
writing. Most of them served as
the advisors to the government
and helped in the formation of
the policies wo oppose, in Viet
nam, China, and the rest of
Asia."
Since it was formed, CCAS
has published four books, pub
lishes a journal with 2,000 sub
scribers and has created a speak
ers bureau.
"In limes of crisis like the
Cambodian situation last year,"
Coye said. "CCAS has become
the operating center for large
scale efforts to penetrate
communities and get tin 1 word
out."
Coye stressed that the intent
of the CCAS members is not
lournalism, but a new kind of
scholarship.
"The chance for us to go
directly to China and then to do
our own writing may hopefully
lead us to different conclusions
and a more supportive policy to

ward the Chinese People's Re
public."
Challenge
CCAS has held "counter-con
ferences" to annual meetings of
the conservative Association of
Asian Scholars. At the CCAS
meeting this spring in Wash
ington. Daniel Ellsberg, recently
associated with the leaking of
the Pentagon papers on Viet
nam, spoke to the CCAS mem
bers. The major action of CCAS
at the AAS convention this
spring was to try to get the
establishment body to sign the
People's Peace Treaty and to
pass a resolution condemning
the Southern Illinois University
Center for Vietnamese Studies
which they claim is funded by
the CIA. These measures were
voted down by the AAS.
Coye commented on a split
which is currently taking place
in CCAS. "Some of these senior
blue ribbon experts, who had in
the past been willing to work
with CCAS, and in fact consider
ed themselves spokesmen for
CCAS, have been increasingly
uncomfortable at the close look
that we have been taking at the
internal affairs of the profession.
"We have exposed the sources
of some research funding and
the decisions about that funding
which were made within the pro
fession that had wide ranging im
plications and we think tended
to distort the field in a very un
healthy direction
Coye stated that the tour ot
the CCAS scholars would have
incredible implications within
the field of Asian Studies. "One
professor has already dismissed
the trip as being of no impor
tance, saying that we are grad
uate students, not scholars. In
fact some of these students are
very advanced graduate students
or post dodorals doing research,
so there is no reason they they
shouldn't be considered
scholars."
Coye said that she felt that
the Chinese had tried to
approach the scholars who were
the most human in the China
field rather then the experts who
run the field.

voted down by the AAS.
Coye commented on a split
which is currently taking place
in CCAS. "Some of these senior
blue ribbon experts, who had in
the past been willing to work
with CCAS, and in fact consider
ed themselves spokesmen for
CCAS, have been increasingly
uncomfortable at the close look
that we have been taking at the
internal affairs of the profession.
"We have exposed the sources
of some research funding and
the decisions about that funding
which were made within the pro
fession that had wide ranging im
plications and we think tended
to distort the field in a very un
healthy direction
Coye stated that the tour ot
the CCAS scholars would have
incredible implications within
the field of Asian Studies. "One
professor has already dismissed
the trip as being of no impor
tance, saying that we are grad
uate students, not scholars. In
fact some of these students are
very advanced graduate students
or post dodorals doing research,
so there is no reason they they
shouldn't be considered
scholars."
Coye said that she felt that
the Chinese had tried to
approach the scholars who were
the most human in the China
field rather then the experts who
run the field.
Kim Woodard, a Stanford
graduate student in political
science, is one of 13 members of
(he Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars now touring the
Peoples Republic of China. The
CCAS Members, who will be in
China for one month, are the
first American scholars to enter
the Communist nation in 22
years. *
The group received its invitat
ion from the Chinese govern
ment on -June 7 and entered
China from Hong Kong on Tues
day. The majority of CCAS

members are graduate students
associated with universities in
the United States. They special
ize in Chinese studies and have
some skill in the Chinese lang
uage.
Woodward and his wife, Jud
ith, were both undergraduates at
Swarthmore College. They spent
1970 at the Stanford Center in
Taiwan studying Chinese. .Judith
is now studying at the Chinese
University in Hong Kong, and

In a statement released in
Hong Kong on Wednesday,


FORBIDDEN PLEASURE Freak-out seekers have been storming
the fences of Manuel Piers' farmland to splash, swim, fish, and
l»e no rally Woodstock at Kelt Lake.
CCAS stated, "The group hopes
to visit rural communes, schools,
hospitals and factories to learn
first hand from the experience
of the people of the new China.
ITiey are grateful for this oppor
tunity to express friendship on a
people-to-people basis and will
carry with them a message of
mutual understanding and a
spirit of peace."
Upon their return to the

United States, the entourage of
seven men and six women plan
to publish their findings collect
ively. They are touring China un
accompanied by foreign news
men.
All of the group's members
had been studying the various as
pects of Chinese Ufa in Hong
Kong at the Universitie's Service
Center.
In an interview with the Daily'
earlier this week Mollie Coye, a
Stanford graduate student and
National CCAS Coordinator,
stated that scholars in CCAS,
"have watched with interest the
non-radical press coverage of this
event and find it interesting that
they fail to mention what CCAS
thinks is the most crucial aspect
of this invitation, that the first
scholars to enter China in 22
years are from the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars and
not from senatorial committees
and government China-watching
groups."
Three Years Old
Coye explained that the Com
mittee was formed three years
ago, "in protest over the un
willingness of the profession of
Asian scholars to take a stand
bearing responsibility for the
uses of their own research and
writing. Most of them served as
the advisors to the government
and helped in the formation of
the policies wo oppose, in Viet
nam, China, and the rest of
Asia."
Since it was formed, CCAS
has published four books, pub
lishes a journal with 2,000 sub
scribers and has created a speak
ers bureau.
"In limes of crisis like the
Cambodian situation last year,"
Coye said. "CCAS has become
the operating center for large
scale efforts to penetrate
communities and get tin 1 word
out."
Coye stressed that the intent
of the CCAS members is not
lournalism, but a new kind of
scholarship.
"The chance for us to go
directly to China and then to do
our own writing may hopefully
lead us to different conclusions
and a more supportive policy to

ward the Chinese People's Re
public."

CCAS has held "counter-con

the conservative Association of

meeting this spring in Wash
ington. Daniel Ellsberg, recently
associated with the leaking of
the Pentagon papers on Viet

at the AAS convention this
spring was to try to get the
establishment body to sign the
People's Peace Treaty and to
pass a resolution condemning
the Southern Illinois University
Center for Vietnamese Studies

the CIA. These measures were

lishes a journal with 2,000 sub
scribers and has created a speak
ers bureau.
"In limes of crisis like the
Cambodian situation last year,"
Coye said. "CCAS has become
the operating center for large
scale efforts to penetrate
communities and get tin 1 word
out."
Coye stressed that the intent
of the CCAS members is not
lournalism, but a new kind of
scholarship.
"The chance for us to go
directly to China and then to do
our own writing may hopefully
lead us to different conclusions
and a more supportive policy to

ward the Chinese People's Re
public."
Challenge
CCAS has held "counter-con
ferences" to annual meetings of
the conservative Association of
Asian Scholars. At the CCAS
meeting this spring in Wash
ington. Daniel Ellsberg, recently
associated with the leaking of
the Pentagon papers on Viet
nam, spoke to the CCAS mem
bers. The major action of CCAS
at the AAS convention this
spring was to try to get the
establishment body to sign the
People's Peace Treaty and to
pass a resolution condemning
the Southern Illinois University
Center for Vietnamese Studies
which they claim is funded by
the CIA. These measures were
voted down by the AAS.
Coye commented on a split
which is currently taking place
in CCAS. "Some of these senior
blue ribbon experts, who had in
the past been willing to work
with CCAS, and in fact consider
ed themselves spokesmen for
CCAS, have been increasingly
uncomfortable at the close look
that we have been taking at the
internal affairs of the profession.
"We have exposed the sources
of some research funding and
the decisions about that funding
which were made within the pro
fession that had wide ranging im
plications and we think tended
to distort the field in a very un
healthy direction
Coye stated that the tour ot
the CCAS scholars would have
incredible implications within
the field of Asian Studies. "One
professor has already dismissed
the trip as being of no impor
tance, saying that we are grad
uate students, not scholars. In
fact some of these students are
very advanced graduate students
or post dodorals doing research,
so there is no reason they they
shouldn't be considered
scholars."
Coye said that she felt that
the Chinese had tried to
approach the scholars who were
the most human in the China
field rather then the experts who
run the field.
Kim Woodard, a Stanford
graduate student in political
science, is one of 13 members of
(he Committee of Concerned
Asian Scholars now touring the
Peoples Republic of China. The
CCAS Members, who will be in
China for one month, are the
first American scholars to enter
the Communist nation in 22
years. *
The group received its invitat
ion from the Chinese govern
ment on -June 7 and entered
China from Hong Kong on Tues
day. The majority of CCAS

members are graduate students
associated with universities in
the United States. They special
ize in Chinese studies and have
some skill in the Chinese lang
uage.
Woodward and his wife, Jud
ith, were both undergraduates at
Swarthmore College. They spent
1970 at the Stanford Center in
Taiwan studying Chinese. .Judith
is now studying at the Chinese
University in Hong Kong, and
Kim is doing research on his dis
sertation on Chinese foreign pol
icy. While attending Stanford,
Kim was vice-president of the

Midpeninsula Free University.
In a statement released in
Hong Kong on Wednesday,


FORBIDDEN PLEASURE Freak-out seekers have been storming
the fences of Manuel Piers' farmland to splash, swim, fish, and
l»e no rally Woodstock at Kelt Lake.
CCAS stated, "The group hopes
to visit rural communes, schools,
hospitals and factories to learn
first hand from the experience
of the people of the new China.
ITiey are grateful for this oppor
tunity to express friendship on a
people-to-people basis and will
carry with them a message of
mutual understanding and a
spirit of peace."
Upon their return to the

United States, the entourage of
seven men and six women plan
to publish their findings collect
ively. They are touring China un
accompanied by foreign news
men.
All of the group's members
had been studying the various as
pects of Chinese Ufa in Hong
Kong at the Universitie's Service
Center.
In an interview with the Daily'
earlier this week Mollie Coye, a
Stanford graduate student and
National CCAS Coordinator,
stated that scholars in CCAS,
"have watched with interest the
non-radical press coverage of this
event and find it interesting that
they fail to mention what CCAS
thinks is the most crucial aspect
of this invitation, that the first
scholars to enter China in 22
years are from the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars and
not from senatorial committees
and government China-watching
groups."
Three Years Old
Coye explained that the Com
mittee was formed three years
ago, "in protest over the un
willingness of the profession of
Asian scholars to take a stand
bearing responsibility for the
uses of their own research and
writing. Most of them served as
the advisors to the government
and helped in the formation of
the policies wo oppose, in Viet
nam, China, and the rest of
Asia."
Since it was formed, CCAS
has published four books, pub
lishes a journal with 2,000 sub
scribers and has created a speak
ers bureau.
"In limes of crisis like the
Cambodian situation last year,"
