# Senate Grants SJC Sanctions
## 
### 
The Academic Senate has
voted, 33-0, to give the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC) new
sanctions against uncooperative
witnesses and defendants.
Suspension and other
penalties less than expulsion
could be recommended for
students who disrupt SJC
hearings or disobey the SJC
chairman, defendants who will
not appear for their hearings,
and defendants or witnesses who
take the stand but refuse to
answer prosecution questions.
The changes must be
approved by President Lyman
and the Student Senate before
taking effect.
Math Professor Soloman

FeffermaJt and graduate student
Paul Grobstein dissented from
the Committee of Fifteen, which
drafted the changes. They
warned the new rules would add
to the judicial system's "serious
p'oblem of legitimacy with
students.' 1
In other action, the Senate
has voted continued support for
student-initiated courses. The
faculty group June 3 approved
further experimental programs
under the Stanford Committee
on Innovation in Research and
Education.
The programs' leaders had
feared the Senate would shift
credit-granting powers for their
course from student-dominated
committees to the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies.
But the Senate approved a
compromise, making SCIRE a
"special joint agency" of the

Dean and SCIRE's ally, the
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies (CUS). This would give
the Dean only the limited power
to send credit proposals to a
special review committee picked
by CUS.
Although officially enacted
for SCIRE's independent study
projects, the plan may also be
applied to SWOPSI's courses on
contemporary issues and the
Urban Studies major.
The Senate also voted
unanimously to give female
faculty members an extra year's
pre-tenure appointment when
they become pregnant while
being considered for tenure. The
added year to complete tenure
requirements would be in
addition to unsalaried maternity
leave.
The trustees must still
approve the new plan.
