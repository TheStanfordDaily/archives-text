# Gate-Crashers Tear Fence Liberate Felt Lake Haven
## 
### My LARRY LIEBERT 
"We could make this another
Woodstock," exclaimed an ex
uberant gate-crasher at Kelt Lake
last week.
Dairyman Manuel Piers
answers, "I'm about to throw in
the sponge."
Piers yesterday offered a
$250 reward for information
leading to the arrest of those
who keep cutting the fences on
the cattle-gra/.ing land he leases
behind Stanford.
But nothing lie has tried so
far has stopped the Stanford
students, street people, and high
schoolers who climb over gates
and tear down fences to reach
(he forbidden lake on his leased
land.
With summer, Kelt Lake has
become u semi-secret haven for
swimmers, fisherman, and
campers. The lake is behind
campus, southwest of Highway
280. lis other boundaries are
Arastradero and Alpine Road.
And it is on land leased from I he
University b\ Piers Dairy.
Fences Cut
Piers said he has always had
uninvited guests scaling his
fences. But for (he firsl time,
some of the crashers I his

summer began cutting open 15-
to 100-foot sections of fence to
bring big crowds, cars, and
motorcycles onto the grazing
land leading to the lake.
The fence-destroyers, who
Piers said face heavy criminal
fines, make him angriest; "They
ought to be clubbed."
According to Piers, he has
workers on duty every day,
i\ pairing the fences to keep his

cattle from wandering off. And
his other workers ride the land
on horseback, carrying rifles and
chasing off invaders.
Explaining thai two quarts of
milk cost less than a single drink
at some bars. Piers said, "The
milk business just can't afford
that kind of expenses."
But Piers' workers are not
alone. Those enjoying the lake
