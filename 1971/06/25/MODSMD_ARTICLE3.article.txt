# Gate-Crashers Tear Fence Liberate Felt Lake Haven
## 
### My LARRY LIEBERT 
"We could make this another
Woodstock," exclaimed an ex
uberant gate-crasher at Kelt Lake
last week.
Dairyman Manuel Piers
answers, "I'm about to throw in
the sponge."
Piers yesterday offered a
$250 reward for information
leading to the arrest of those
who keep cutting the fences on
the cattle-gra/.ing land he leases
behind Stanford.
But nothing lie has tried so
far has stopped the Stanford
students, street people, and high
schoolers who climb over gates
and tear down fences to reach
(he forbidden lake on his leased
land.
With summer, Kelt Lake has
become u semi-secret haven for
swimmers, fisherman, and
campers. The lake is behind
campus, southwest of Highway
280. lis other boundaries are
Arastradero and Alpine Road.
And it is on land leased from I he
University b\ Piers Dairy.
Fences Cut
Piers said he has always had
uninvited guests scaling his
fences. But for (he firsl time,
some of the crashers I his

summer began cutting open 15-
to 100-foot sections of fence to
bring big crowds, cars, and
motorcycles onto the grazing
land leading to the lake.
The fence-destroyers, who
Piers said face heavy criminal
fines, make him angriest; "They
ought to be clubbed."
According to Piers, he has
workers on duty every day,
i\ pairing the fences to keep his

cattle from wandering off. And
his other workers ride the land
on horseback, carrying rifles and
chasing off invaders.
Explaining thai two quarts of
milk cost less than a single drink
at some bars. Piers said, "The
milk business just can't afford
that kind of expenses."
But Piers' workers are not
alone. Those enjoying the lake
have also come up against
sheriff's deputies from Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties,
Stanford campus policemen, and
even San Mateo's controversial
spy-in-the-sky helicopter.
The assorted police chase off
the sun-worshippers with threats
of trespass arrests. But soon a
new group filters across the
yellow grassland to the lake. The
police are escalating a
little-they have begun
threatening charges for such
additional infractions as nude
swimming.
A Stanford senior who
recently climbed the gate said,
"The water's great. It's warm
and deep."
She said she has seen up to 25
cars left along Alpine Road
while their owners visited the
lake.
While she waded one
afternoon, she saw high
schoolers sunning on a platform
in mid- lake, swimming, and
fishing.
University Land
George Burtness of the
University Real Estate Office
said Stanford could end Piers'
lease and take over the land. But
he said opening the lake as a
recreation area would involve
substantial costs for fire
protection, policing, sanitation
facilities, lifeguards, and
insurance.
He said any less formal setup
would "bring a lawsuit if
someone breaks a leg up there."
But such a country club

facility is just what the current
crashers would most despise. A
visitor explained Felt Lake's real
attraction is its secluded
location, natural surroundings,
and still fairly small crowds.
"We don't want another Lake
Lag," she insisted.
Hiking Trail
Piers is not an unyielding foe
of nature-lovers. He has allowed
Stanford conservationists to
chart a hikers' trail through part
of his land just behind campus.
With summer trail monitors
now lined up, hikers can apply
for passes to the trail beginning
Monday. Passes will be available
in Encina 105 to students, staff,
and faculty who sign a pledge to
follow rules "for the
preservation of the natural
condition of the land."
The rules require staying on
trails, prohibit littering, and
stress Piers' "livestock is not to
be disturbed."
The trail begins at
Junipero-Serra Boulevard across
from Stanford Avenue. After a
trip through the nearest
foothills, it leads the hikers baek
to Junipero-Serra across from
summer-dried Lake Lagunita.
Piers said, "The trail is goof
for those who like to hike. No
one interferes with them."
But the trail is not expected
to relieve the ever-mounting
crowds headed for Kelt Lake.
And Piers points to rumors a
massive Be-in has been called for
the Lake July 4.
He sighs, "As far as we're
concerned, we're stuck."

ALTERNATE FOOD—The bigtime version of a lemonade stand, the Alternate Food Service, is again
peddling yogurt and sandwiches in White Plaza. Set up in spring to boycott Tresidder Union after 12
workers were laid off, the culinary protestors were last week ordered off the Tresidder terrace under an
unspecified new rule.

threatening charges for such
additional infractions as nude
swimming.
A Stanford senior who
recently climbed the gate said,
"The water's great. It's warm
and deep."
She said she has seen up to 25
cars left along Alpine Road
while their owners visited the
lake.
While she waded one
afternoon, she saw high
schoolers sunning on a platform
in mid- lake, swimming, and
fishing.
University Land
George Burtness of the
University Real Estate Office
said Stanford could end Piers'
lease and take over the land. But
he said opening the lake as a
recreation area would involve
substantial costs for fire
protection, policing, sanitation
facilities, lifeguards, and
insurance.
He said any less formal setup
would "bring a lawsuit if
someone breaks a leg up there."
But such a country club

facility is just what the current
crashers would most despise. A
visitor explained Felt Lake's real
attraction is its secluded
location, natural surroundings,
and still fairly small crowds.
"We don't want another Lake
Lag," she insisted.
Hiking Trail
Piers is not an unyielding foe
of nature-lovers. He has allowed
Stanford conservationists to
chart a hikers' trail through part
of his land just behind campus.
With summer trail monitors
now lined up, hikers can apply
for passes to the trail beginning
Monday. Passes will be available
in Encina 105 to students, staff,
and faculty who sign a pledge to
follow rules "for the
preservation of the natural
condition of the land."
The rules require staying on
trails, prohibit littering, and
stress Piers' "livestock is not to
be disturbed."
The trail begins at
Junipero-Serra Boulevard across
from Stanford Avenue. After a
trip through the nearest
foothills, it leads the hikers baek
to Junipero-Serra across from
summer-dried Lake Lagunita.
Piers said, "The trail is goof
for those who like to hike. No
one interferes with them."
But the trail is not expected
to relieve the ever-mounting
crowds headed for Kelt Lake.
And Piers points to rumors a
massive Be-in has been called for
the Lake July 4.
He sighs, "As far as we're
concerned, we're stuck."

ALTERNATE FOOD—The bigtime version of a lemonade stand, the Alternate Food Service, is again
peddling yogurt and sandwiches in White Plaza. Set up in spring to boycott Tresidder Union after 12
workers were laid off, the culinary protestors were last week ordered off the Tresidder terrace under an
unspecified new rule.
"We could make this another
Woodstock," exclaimed an ex
uberant gate-crasher at Kelt Lake
last week.
Dairyman Manuel Piers
answers, "I'm about to throw in
the sponge."
Piers yesterday offered a
$250 reward for information
leading to the arrest of those
who keep cutting the fences on
the cattle-gra/.ing land he leases
behind Stanford.
But nothing lie has tried so
far has stopped the Stanford
students, street people, and high
schoolers who climb over gates
and tear down fences to reach
(he forbidden lake on his leased
land.
With summer, Kelt Lake has
become u semi-secret haven for
swimmers, fisherman, and
campers. The lake is behind
campus, southwest of Highway
280. lis other boundaries are
Arastradero and Alpine Road.
And it is on land leased from I he
University b\ Piers Dairy.
Fences Cut
Piers said he has always had
uninvited guests scaling his
fences. But for (he firsl time,
some of the crashers I his

summer began cutting open 15-
to 100-foot sections of fence to
bring big crowds, cars, and
motorcycles onto the grazing
land leading to the lake.
The fence-destroyers, who
Piers said face heavy criminal
fines, make him angriest; "They
ought to be clubbed."
According to Piers, he has
workers on duty every day,
i\ pairing the fences to keep his

cattle from wandering off. And
his other workers ride the land
on horseback, carrying rifles and
chasing off invaders.
Explaining thai two quarts of
milk cost less than a single drink
at some bars. Piers said, "The
milk business just can't afford
that kind of expenses."
But Piers' workers are not
alone. Those enjoying the lake
have also come up against
sheriff's deputies from Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties,
Stanford campus policemen, and
even San Mateo's controversial
spy-in-the-sky helicopter.
The assorted police chase off
the sun-worshippers with threats
of trespass arrests. But soon a
new group filters across the
yellow grassland to the lake. The
police are escalating a
little-they have begun
threatening charges for such
additional infractions as nude
swimming.
