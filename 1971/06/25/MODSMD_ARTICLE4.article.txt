# Times' Report Tests Press Freedom

### 
"Congress shall make no
law. . . abridging the freedom of
speech, or of the press ..."
First Amendment, U.S. Constitution
[in force Dec. 1 5 ,1791 ]
"The liberty of the press is indeed
essential to the nature of a free state;
but this consists in laying no previous
restraints on publications, and not
freedom from censure for criminal
matter when published. Every free man
has an undoubted right to lay what
sentiments he pleases before the public:
to forbid this is to destroy the freedom
of the press: but if he publishes what is
improper, mischievous, or illegal, he
must take the consequences of his own
temerity."
--Sir William Blackstone

News Analysis
WASHINGTON - Sunday, June 13
was a cool, cloudy day in the Nation's
Capitol —• weatherwise, that is.
Politically, both pro- and
anti-administration forces were
pressure-cooking on all available
burners, and their kitchens were hot,
broiling hot.
For the New York Times, the
paradigm of the Liberal Eastern
Establishment Press, had published what
probably represents the news story of
the decade, the first of a five-part series
entitled, appropriately enough,
"Vietnam Archive."
The "Archive" is a blow-by-blow
account, compiled by one of former
Secretary of Defense Robert
McNamara's top aides, of exactly how
the United States became enmeshed in
Indochina and how the Congress and
the people of this country were
deliberately misled by four successive
presidential administrations.
The report, consisting of cables,
memos, reports, contingency plans, etc.
was labeled "Top Secret-Sensitive," and
only 15 copies were supposed to have
been made, according to the Defense

Department. The report, finished two
years ago, covers the period between the
Truman and Johnson administrations.
Unprecedented Action
The Times published three
installments in the series before it was
halted by an unprecedented temporary
restraining order (TRO) signed by U.S.
District Court Judge Murray I. Gurfein
at the request of Atty. Gen. John N.
Mitchell. The TRO expired at 1 p.m.
Saturday; shortly thereafter, Judge
Gurfein ruled against the government
and refused to enjoin the Times from
printing the remainder of the series.
In its case, the government argued
that publication of the report would
cause "irreparable" damage to the
nation's security and would jeopardize
this nation's dealings with other
countries.
The government also claimed - two
days after the documents were first
published — that ver batem publication
of the texts involved in the study would
enable other countries to break the U.S.
codes used for overseas transmissions of
military and diplomatic messages.
However, one State Department
employee said that all of the codes have
been changed since President Nixon
took office in 1969 and the deciphering
of the old codes would not effect
present military and State Department
traffic.
Gurfein's Opinion
Ir« his opinion supporting the Times'
right to publish the study, Judge
Gurfein wrote:
"This Court does not doubt the right
of the Government to injunctive relief
against a newspaper that is about to
publish information or documents vital
to current national security. But it does
not find that to be the case here . . .
"... [The proceedings! ... did not
convince this Court that the publication
of these historical documents would
seriously breach the national security. It
is true, of course, that any breach of
security will cause the jitters in the

security agencies themselves and indeed
in foreign governments who deal with
us. But to sustain a preliminary
injunction the Government would have
to establish not only irreparable injury,
but also the possibility of success in the
litigation itself . . .
"The First Amendment of a 'free
press' must be read in the light of the
struggle of free men against prior
restraint of publication. From the time
of Blackstone it was a tenet of the
founding fathers that precensorship was
the primary evil to be dealt with in the
First Amendment... A cantankerous
press, an obstinate press, a übiquitous
press must be suffered by those in
authority in order to preserve the even
greater values of freedom of expression
and the right of the people to
know ..."
Appeal Court Acts
The Justice Department, knowing
that the Times was holding front page
space for the next installment, quickly
went before the U.S. Appeals Court in
New York, where Judge Irving R.
Kaufman enjoined further publication
of the series pending further hearings.
The Appeals Court Wednesday ruled
that the Times could print some of the
material contained in the report after
Judge Gurfei had read it and ascertained
that it does not threaten national
security.
The Times yesterday morning
appealed to the Supreme Court. A
hearing date on its plea for emergency
relief has not been scheduled.
In the meantime, the Washington
Post obtained a copy of the Pentagon
study, and managed to publish two
installments of its own series before
being halted by the Appeals Court.
The Post, like the Times is preparing
an appeal to the Supreme Court.
Other papers — including the Miami
Herald, the Chicago Sun-Times and the
Los Angeles Times have now printed
portions of the Pentagon report.
Preparations for the Times' series--
distilling the 7,000 page, 47 volume

report into something newspaper
readers could digest — took six reporters
three months of full-time work.
"Project X," as the preparations were
known to the Times' management, was
a remarkably well-kept secret for the
newspaper profession; word that
something was going on at the Times
found its way into print only once, in
the weekly New York Village Voice.
Reporters at other papers, including the
Post, knew that the Times was working
on the study, but they didn't know
when or in what form it would appear.
Thus, when the "Vietnam Archive"
reports and texts were begun on June
13, most of the Capitol (and the nation)
was taken by surprise.
* * *
Many interesting points about the
Times-Post situation could be raised:
1. Atty. Gen. Mitchell waited two
and one half days before seeking the
unprecedented restraining order. (The
case has been under the Attorney
General's personal direction since
Saturday night, June 12, when the early
editions of the paper became available
on downtown New York City
newsstands.)
2. The Attorney General's asking
that the report be suppressed, in
addition to being unprecedented, may
be unconstitutional; his request, as
Judge Gurfein ruled, was contrary to
the letter and the spirit of the First
Amendment. The United States
government has never had the right of
prior censorship of a newspaper.
3. The Times could conceivably have
gotten away with publishing all of the
Pentagon's study that it wished to — if
the editors had elected to put the
analysis and the texts into one huge
section of the Sunday paper. It is
unclear why this route was not taken;
conceivably, the editors wanted to make
publication of the papers a "test case"
to set future precedent. However, it is
also known that Neil Sheehan, the
reporter responsible for obtaining the
report, had not finished his commentary


"What's so to/) sci ret.' Dad ' I've been telling von that l<n wars
Saturday night when the
paper went to press.
4. The Post was able to get at
least part of the Pentagon report
some two days after the Times
began its series even as the FBI
and the Defense Department
were conducting an intensive
investigation to determine who
leaked the report to the Times.
5. The FBI, after more than a
week's work, has yet to appre
hend anyone for illegally copy
ing and circulating the report
and turning it over to the Times
for publication.
Sidney E. Zion, a former
Times reporter who later edited
the now-bankrupt "Scanlan's
Magazine," claimed on a New
York radio program that Daniel
Kllsberg, an MIT economist, was
responsible for the leak. A
similar report appeared in the St.
Ixjuis Post-Dispatch. Ellsberg
worked in both the State and
Defense Departments during the
Johnson administration, and also
for the RAND Corp., which was
given a copy of the secret report.
Ellsberg, who has not been
seen for several days, will neither
confirm nor deny that he leaked
the report to the Times. He said,
however, that he was "relieved"
the report was getting coverage.
A supporter of the Johnson war
policies while he worked for the

government, Ellsberg has since
reversed his position, and, ac
cording to members of his
family, "regrets" his actions.
Rep. Paul McCloskey
(RCalif.) told reporters that
6. It has taken the general
press — with the exception of
some "radical" publications -
years to expose what the
Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy
and Johnson (and quite possibly
Nixon) administrations were
doing.

The crucial question raised by
The United Stales of America v.
The New York Times as well as
by the Post case seems to be
this: which causes "irreparable'
damage to this country
publication of documents that
clearly expose the government in
an historical manner or the
blatent censorship of those
documents, whose authenticity
has never been questioned.
In other words, do the
American people have the right
to know something that the
President of the United States
doesn't want them to know for
political reasons? Does the

government, in effect, have the
right to license what a
newspaper — or any other
publication or type of media
may or may not be able to print
or say to protect its own
political positions?
Research shows that the
Court has ruled only once on the
question of pre-publication
censorship; in that case, the High
Court overruled the State of
Minnesota in its attempt to
suppress a local scandal sheet.
The Washington State Tri
City Herald was restrained for
four days in 1949 by a state
court from printing a story
alleging shoddy housing
construction by a local
contractor. The restraining order
was dissolved by an appeals
court, and a threatened libel suit
never developed.
As the Pentagon report
becomes available to more and
more papers, the government's
case becomes increasingly moot.
But the Supreme Court, no
matter which way it rules, will
be setting a precedent certain to
have far-reaching effects on the
rights of the press and of free
speech.
