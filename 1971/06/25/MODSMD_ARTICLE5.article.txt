Dear Stanford Community:
Wo at the Daily (especially we
on the opinions page) would be
glad to hear any reactions,
praise, comments, or of course,
any complaints or corrections,
you might have about anything
that has been printed (or not
printed) in our paper.
You may submit your
(complaints, comments, praises
pick one) in the form of. To the
Editor, at the Stanford Daily,
and pray that the Post Office
gets it here. (If you type the
letter, we would be out of our
minds with joy, but if you write
it, print it, or even submit it in a
fortune cookie, we would be
willing to struggle with it.)

Of course, if you get so tired
of Bill Evers' column that you
just can't take another one, you
may even submit one of your
own, on any subject you like.
All that we ask is that you get it
to us typed on something
resembling a 60 space line,
double spaced.
We publish every Tuesday
and Friday. We on the opinions
page would greatly appreciate it
if material would be submitted
two days before. (However, if
you turn it in the day before,
we'll even struggle with that.)
In service to the
People, the Opinions
Page Editor.
