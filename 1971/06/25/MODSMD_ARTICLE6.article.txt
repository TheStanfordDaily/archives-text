## Drugs, Army, Lyman

President Nixon has found an
issue around which he hopes to
unite a large constituency—the
issue of heroin use.
The government, estimates
that 26,000 to 39,000 American
soldiers use hard drugs. Repre
sentative Seymour Hal pern of
New York, who has been to
Viet-Nam recently, estimates
60,000. Nixon has proclaimed:
"America's Public Enemy No. 1
is drug abuse."
Nixon has announced a $371
million anti-drug program. Much
of this expenditure will go to
finance compulsory treatment
for and rehabilitation of veterans
who come back from Vietnam as
heroin addicts.
Since June 20, American
soldiers leaving Viet-Nam have
had to take a urine test designed
to determine whether they are
heroin users. If the urinalysis
indicates that the soldier is a
drug user, he is given five days of
treatment at Camranh Bay. He

may be given two months
further treatment in either Army
or Veterans Administration facil
ities in the United States.
After the program was an
nounced, the American Civil
Liberties Union attacked the
armed forces' intention to tell
law enforcement agencies the
results of the urine tests and
their intention to pass on to
other governmental agencies in
formation obtained from sol
diers by psychiatrists during the
compulsory treatment program.
The ACLU has further pointed
out that the Defense Depart
ment has no right to detain
soldiers in the military beyond
their period of enlistment for
drug addiction rehabilitation.
* * *
Oh, rehabilitation, what
crimes are commited in thy
name! Too many. As an exam
ple, the Supreme Court, ruled on
June 21 that juveniles do not
have a constitutional right to

trial by jury. The Court decided
that the "fond" and "idealistic"
possibility of rehabilitation
through the paternalistic juvenile
court system was more impor
tant.
* * *
The present compulsory drug
treatment program for veterans
blends together some of the
worst aspects of the American
system. In the first place, for
many soldiers the involuntary
hospital i/.ation will be an exten
sion of involuntary service under
conscription. In the second
place, it is a case (as with
marijuana) of the government in
tervening in citizens' lives to
stop them from pursuing a habit
that they have freely chosen. To
point out the dangers of heroin
changes nothing, laws prohibit
ing suicide are ridiculous.
With the military persisting as
one of the two governmental
institutions in America which
claim that the Bill of Rights does

not apply to them (the other is
the public school system), it is
no wonder that the rights of
(J.l.'s are continually violaicJ, as
in the anti-drug program.
In response to these condi
tions, more and more soldiers
are deserting. There were 40,227
deserters in fiscal 1967 and
89,088 deserters in fiscal 1970.
It is a further indication of our
blindness to the rights of soldiers
that desertion as such is regarded
as a heinous crime. It is simply
an instance of a person changing
his mind and quitting work. In
normal contracts for labor ser
vices, people cannot be forced to
continue at their place of work
after they change their mind and
decide to quit.
Because a person's control
over his own will is inalienable,
he cannot, in justice, be compell
ed to continue an arrangement
whereby he submits his will to
others.
In discussing this very ques
tion, Civil War-era jurist Lysand
er Spooner wrote: "This right of

personal liberty is inalienable.
No man can sell it, or transfer it
to another; or give to another
any right of arbitrary dominion
over him. All contracts for such
a purpose are absurd and void
contracts, that no man can
rightfully be compelled to fulfill.
"Hut when a deluded or
ignorant young man has once
been enticed into a contract to
kill others, and to take his
chances of being killed himself,
in the service of the government,
for any given number of years,
the government holds that such
a contract to sell his liberty, his
judgment, his conscience, and
his life, is a valid and binding
contract; and that if he fails to
fulfill it, he may rightfully be
shot."

An item of campus news
which has not received the
commentary' it deserves is the
content of President Richard
Lyman's speech to the 1971
alumni conference on May 22.
The text appears, under the title
"The Agonies of Choice," in the
June Alumni Almanac, and
stories on the speech appeared in
the May 26 Campus Report,
under the title "Authoritarian
Relief May Be Human Choice,"
and in the May 24 Daily, under
the title "Excess Freedom
Causes Unrest."
In his speech, Lyman adopts
the position of neo-Freudian
psychoanalyst Erich Fromm(also
the position of the Grand
Inquisitor in Dostoyevsky's
Brothers Karamazov) that hu
man beings, when faced with
greater liberty and more choices,
tend to seek escape from the
decision-making and responsibili
ties of their new condition by
following authoritarian leaders
and creeds.
Lyman suggests in the speech
that people at present yearn for
an illiberal society of status in
which their "sense of belonging,
of identification with one place
or region" might be fulfilled.
He says, "Cultural choice is
enormous, but so much so that
choosing itself becomes an ago
ny, something one would rather
not think about."

He goes on to contend,
"Freedom of speech, of associa
tion, of confrontation are more
widespread then ever, hut the
thrill of exercising these free
doms does subside after a time.
When the ground is then survey
ed in search of concrete gains
through their exercise, the re
sults are discouraging."
The significance of all this lies
in the fact that President Lyman
believes that the tendency to
seek authoritarian solutions is
inherent in man. This vitiates all
the arguments we have heard
over the years from him and his
subordinates about "rational dis
course" and "academic free
dom."
How can we believe state
ments about the importance of
freedom of choice within the
University from a man who
believes efforts to maximize
human liberty and to maximize
rational consideration of issues
are doomed beforehand by a
human tendency to accept "to
talitarian systems as preferable
to enduring the agonies of
choice."

the title "Excess Freedom
Causes Unrest."
In his speech, Lyman adopts
the position of neo-Freudian
psychoanalyst Erich Fromm(also
the position of the Grand
Inquisitor in Dostoyevsky's
Brothers Karamazov) that hu
man beings, when faced with
greater liberty and more choices,
tend to seek escape from the
decision-making and responsibili
ties of their new condition by
following authoritarian leaders
and creeds.
Lyman suggests in the speech
that people at present yearn for
an illiberal society of status in
which their "sense of belonging,
of identification with one place
or region" might be fulfilled.
He says, "Cultural choice is
enormous, but so much so that
choosing itself becomes an ago
ny, something one would rather
not think about."

He goes on to contend,
"Freedom of speech, of associa
tion, of confrontation are more
widespread then ever, hut the
thrill of exercising these free
doms does subside after a time.
When the ground is then survey
ed in search of concrete gains
through their exercise, the re
sults are discouraging."
The significance of all this lies
in the fact that President Lyman
believes that the tendency to
seek authoritarian solutions is
inherent in man. This vitiates all
the arguments we have heard
over the years from him and his
subordinates about "rational dis
course" and "academic free
dom."
How can we believe state
ments about the importance of
freedom of choice within the
University from a man who
believes efforts to maximize
human liberty and to maximize
rational consideration of issues
are doomed beforehand by a
human tendency to accept "to
talitarian systems as preferable
to enduring the agonies of
choice."

President Nixon has found an
issue around which he hopes to
unite a large constituency—the
issue of heroin use.
The government, estimates
that 26,000 to 39,000 American
soldiers use hard drugs. Repre
sentative Seymour Hal pern of
New York, who has been to
Viet-Nam recently, estimates
60,000. Nixon has proclaimed:
"America's Public Enemy No. 1
is drug abuse."
Nixon has announced a $371
million anti-drug program. Much
of this expenditure will go to
finance compulsory treatment
for and rehabilitation of veterans
who come back from Vietnam as
heroin addicts.
Since June 20, American
soldiers leaving Viet-Nam have
had to take a urine test designed
to determine whether they are
heroin users. If the urinalysis
indicates that the soldier is a
drug user, he is given five days of
treatment at Camranh Bay. He

may be given two months
further treatment in either Army
or Veterans Administration facil
ities in the United States.
After the program was an
nounced, the American Civil
Liberties Union attacked the
armed forces' intention to tell
law enforcement agencies the
results of the urine tests and
their intention to pass on to
other governmental agencies in
formation obtained from sol
diers by psychiatrists during the
compulsory treatment program.
The ACLU has further pointed
out that the Defense Depart
ment has no right to detain
soldiers in the military beyond
their period of enlistment for
drug addiction rehabilitation.
* * *
Oh, rehabilitation, what
crimes are commited in thy
name! Too many. As an exam
ple, the Supreme Court, ruled on
June 21 that juveniles do not
have a constitutional right to

trial by jury. The Court decided
that the "fond" and "idealistic"
possibility of rehabilitation
through the paternalistic juvenile
court system was more impor
tant.
* * *
The present compulsory drug
treatment program for veterans
blends together some of the
worst aspects of the American
system. In the first place, for
many soldiers the involuntary
hospital i/.ation will be an exten
sion of involuntary service under
conscription. In the second
place, it is a case (as with
marijuana) of the government in
tervening in citizens' lives to
stop them from pursuing a habit
that they have freely chosen. To
point out the dangers of heroin
changes nothing, laws prohibit
ing suicide are ridiculous.
With the military persisting as
one of the two governmental
institutions in America which
claim that the Bill of Rights does

not apply to them (the other is
the public school system), it is
no wonder that the rights of
(J.l.'s are continually violaicJ, as
in the anti-drug program.
In response to these condi
tions, more and more soldiers
are deserting. There were 40,227
deserters in fiscal 1967 and
89,088 deserters in fiscal 1970.
It is a further indication of our
blindness to the rights of soldiers
that desertion as such is regarded
as a heinous crime. It is simply
an instance of a person changing
his mind and quitting work. In
normal contracts for labor ser
vices, people cannot be forced to
continue at their place of work
after they change their mind and
decide to quit.
Because a person's control
over his own will is inalienable,
he cannot, in justice, be compell
ed to continue an arrangement
whereby he submits his will to
others.
In discussing this very ques
tion, Civil War-era jurist Lysand
er Spooner wrote: "This right of

personal liberty is inalienable.
No man can sell it, or transfer it
to another; or give to another
any right of arbitrary dominion
over him. All contracts for such
a purpose are absurd and void
contracts, that no man can
rightfully be compelled to fulfill.
"Hut when a deluded or
ignorant young man has once
been enticed into a contract to
kill others, and to take his
chances of being killed himself,
in the service of the government,
for any given number of years,
the government holds that such
a contract to sell his liberty, his
judgment, his conscience, and
his life, is a valid and binding
contract; and that if he fails to
fulfill it, he may rightfully be
shot."

an instance of a person changing
his mind and quitting work. In
normal contracts for labor ser
vices, people cannot be forced to
continue at their place of work
after they change their mind and
decide to quit.
Because a person's control
over his own will is inalienable,
he cannot, in justice, be compell
ed to continue an arrangement
whereby he submits his will to
others.
In discussing this very ques
tion, Civil War-era jurist Lysand

personal liberty is inalienable.
No man can sell it, or transfer it
to another; or give to another
any right of arbitrary dominion
over him. All contracts for such
a purpose are absurd and void
contracts, that no man can
rightfully be compelled to fulfill.
"Hut when a deluded or
ignorant young man has once
been enticed into a contract to
kill others, and to take his
chances of being killed himself,
in the service of the government,
for any given number of years,
the government holds that such
a contract to sell his liberty, his
judgment, his conscience, and
his life, is a valid and binding
contract; and that if he fails to
fulfill it, he may rightfully be

An item of campus news
which has not received the
commentary' it deserves is the
content of President Richard
Lyman's speech to the 1971
alumni conference on May 22.
The text appears, under the title
"The Agonies of Choice," in the
June Alumni Almanac, and
stories on the speech appeared in
the May 26 Campus Report,
under the title "Authoritarian
Relief May Be Human Choice,"
and in the May 24 Daily, under
the title "Excess Freedom
Causes Unrest."
In his speech, Lyman adopts
the position of neo-Freudian
psychoanalyst Erich Fromm(also
the position of the Grand
Inquisitor in Dostoyevsky's
Brothers Karamazov) that hu
man beings, when faced with
greater liberty and more choices,
tend to seek escape from the
decision-making and responsibili
ties of their new condition by
following authoritarian leaders
and creeds.
Lyman suggests in the speech
that people at present yearn for
an illiberal society of status in
which their "sense of belonging,
of identification with one place
or region" might be fulfilled.
He says, "Cultural choice is
enormous, but so much so that
choosing itself becomes an ago
ny, something one would rather
not think about."

He goes on to contend,
"Freedom of speech, of associa
tion, of confrontation are more
widespread then ever, hut the
thrill of exercising these free
doms does subside after a time.
When the ground is then survey
ed in search of concrete gains
through their exercise, the re
sults are discouraging."
The significance of all this lies
in the fact that President Lyman
believes that the tendency to
seek authoritarian solutions is
inherent in man. This vitiates all
the arguments we have heard
over the years from him and his
subordinates about "rational dis
course" and "academic free
dom."
How can we believe state
ments about the importance of
freedom of choice within the
University from a man who
believes efforts to maximize
human liberty and to maximize
rational consideration of issues
are doomed beforehand by a
human tendency to accept "to
talitarian systems as preferable
to enduring the agonies of
choice."

President Nixon has found an
issue around which he hopes to
unite a large constituency—the
issue of heroin use.
The government, estimates
that 26,000 to 39,000 American
soldiers use hard drugs. Repre
sentative Seymour Hal pern of
New York, who has been to
Viet-Nam recently, estimates
60,000. Nixon has proclaimed:
"America's Public Enemy No. 1
is drug abuse."
Nixon has announced a $371
million anti-drug program. Much
of this expenditure will go to
finance compulsory treatment
for and rehabilitation of veterans
who come back from Vietnam as
heroin addicts.
Since June 20, American
soldiers leaving Viet-Nam have
had to take a urine test designed
to determine whether they are
heroin users. If the urinalysis
indicates that the soldier is a
drug user, he is given five days of
treatment at Camranh Bay. He

may be given two months
further treatment in either Army
or Veterans Administration facil
ities in the United States.
After the program was an
nounced, the American Civil
Liberties Union attacked the
armed forces' intention to tell
law enforcement agencies the
results of the urine tests and
their intention to pass on to
other governmental agencies in
formation obtained from sol
diers by psychiatrists during the
compulsory treatment program.
The ACLU has further pointed
out that the Defense Depart
ment has no right to detain
soldiers in the military beyond
their period of enlistment for
drug addiction rehabilitation.
* * *
Oh, rehabilitation, what
crimes are commited in thy
name! Too many. As an exam
ple, the Supreme Court, ruled on
June 21 that juveniles do not
have a constitutional right to

trial by jury. The Court decided
that the "fond" and "idealistic"
possibility of rehabilitation
through the paternalistic juvenile
court system was more impor
tant.
* * *
The present compulsory drug
treatment program for veterans
blends together some of the
worst aspects of the American
system. In the first place, for
many soldiers the involuntary
hospital i/.ation will be an exten
sion of involuntary service under
conscription. In the second
place, it is a case (as with
marijuana) of the government in
tervening in citizens' lives to
stop them from pursuing a habit
that they have freely chosen. To
point out the dangers of heroin
changes nothing, laws prohibit
ing suicide are ridiculous.
With the military persisting as
one of the two governmental
institutions in America which
claim that the Bill of Rights does

not apply to them (the other is
the public school system), it is
no wonder that the rights of
(J.l.'s are continually violaicJ, as
in the anti-drug program.
In response to these condi
tions, more and more soldiers
are deserting. There were 40,227
deserters in fiscal 1967 and
89,088 deserters in fiscal 1970.
It is a further indication of our
blindness to the rights of soldiers
that desertion as such is regarded
as a heinous crime. It is simply
an instance of a person changing
his mind and quitting work. In
normal contracts for labor ser
vices, people cannot be forced to
continue at their place of work
