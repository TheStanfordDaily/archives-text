# Lutists To Perform
## 
### COLLEEN SNYDER 
The Stanford Lute Workshop
will present the first of two
scheduled concerts this summer
on Saturday, June 26 at 8:00
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The concert will feature the
faculty of the workshop, all of
whom are well-known by lute
enthusiasts, and will be free to
the public.
The workshop is an intensive
two-week session that is open to
all lute devotees from complete
beginner to very advanced. On
Monday through Friday from
9:00 to 5:00, there are classes,
rehearsals, lectures, lessons,
demonstrations and informal
concerts. There are also several
evening sessions and any extra
hours are spent in individual
practice.
It is an extremely demanding
schedule, but instead of
complaining, lute enthusiasts
eagerly come from all over the
country to participate.
According to Stanley Buetens,
the Director of the workshop
and a member of the regular
Stanford Music Department
faculty, it is the only place in
the world where an entire
workshop is dedicated to the
lute on a serious academic plane.
Total Dedication
Buetens, like a growing
number of lute enthusiasts, is a
living example of total
dedication to the lute. He was
among the founding fathers of
the "Lute Society of America,"

which was formed seven years
ago, and has been President of
the organization since last year.
It was during his first term as
president that he conceived of
the idea of having a serious lute
workshop given here at
Stanford. Last summer was the
inaugural year for the program,
and since it proved successful
was repeated again this summer.
For those who are not
entirely sure what a lute is, it is a
string instrument somewhat
similar in size and shape to a
guitar. The body of the
instrument looks somewhat like
a large pear-shaped watermelon
that has been cut in half
lengthwise. The head or pegbox
of the instrument is
characteristically bent at a right
angle to the neck or fingerboard.
All lutes have a "rosette"
which corresponds to the
sounding hole of a guitar and is
carved directly into the wood of
the instrument. These are
sometimes quite ornate and
require a great deal of
craftsmanship to create. Lutes
normally have anywhere from
11 to 15 strings although they
may have more. The lute that
belonged to J.S. Bach, who was
an avid lute fan, had 24 strings.
Oriental Instrument
The lute was originally an
oriental instrument that was
brought to Europe in the 12th
and 13the centuries by the
crusaders, which just goes to
show that the crusaders were

pursuing things other than
religious infidels. It was
originally played in Europe, as it
was in the Orient, with a quill or
pluctrum, but during the late
15th century it was found that
by using the fingers instead of a
quill more than one string could
be played at once. The
instrument became more
versatile since more than one
melodic line could be played at a
time.
This and the fact that a lute
was much more portable than an
organ created a school of
composition that lasted for 300
years through the Medieval,
Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo,
and Classical eras of music
history. However, lute
enthusiasts consider the 16th
century as the Golden Era of
lute music.
Decline of the Lute
After the 17th century the
popularity of the lute declined;
the last music written for the
lute was a series of variations on
an aria from Mozart's "Don
Giovanni." But today interest is
again being stimulated by groups
such as the "Lute Society of
America"and by workshops
such as the one given here at
Stanford.
Tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the
Music Department will sponsor a
recital of Pre-Baroque and
Baroque works for Viola da
Gamba. Martha Blackman will
be the Viola da Gamba soloist.

again being stimulated by groups
such as the "Lute Society of
America"and by workshops
such as the one given here at
Stanford.
Tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium the
Music Department will sponsor a
recital of Pre-Baroque and
Baroque works for Viola da
Gamba. Martha Blackman will
be the Viola da Gamba soloist.
The Stanford Lute Workshop
will present the first of two
scheduled concerts this summer
on Saturday, June 26 at 8:00
p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The concert will feature the
faculty of the workshop, all of
whom are well-known by lute
enthusiasts, and will be free to
the public.
The workshop is an intensive
two-week session that is open to
all lute devotees from complete
beginner to very advanced. On
Monday through Friday from
9:00 to 5:00, there are classes,
rehearsals, lectures, lessons,
demonstrations and informal
concerts. There are also several
evening sessions and any extra
hours are spent in individual
practice.
It is an extremely demanding
schedule, but instead of
complaining, lute enthusiasts
eagerly come from all over the
country to participate.
According to Stanley Buetens,
the Director of the workshop
and a member of the regular
Stanford Music Department
faculty, it is the only place in
the world where an entire
workshop is dedicated to the
lute on a serious academic plane.
Total Dedication
Buetens, like a growing
number of lute enthusiasts, is a
living example of total
dedication to the lute. He was
among the founding fathers of
the "Lute Society of America,"

which was formed seven years
ago, and has been President of
the organization since last year.
It was during his first term as
president that he conceived of
the idea of having a serious lute
workshop given here at
Stanford. Last summer was the
inaugural year for the program,
and since it proved successful
was repeated again this summer.
For those who are not
entirely sure what a lute is, it is a
string instrument somewhat
similar in size and shape to a
guitar. The body of the
instrument looks somewhat like
a large pear-shaped watermelon
that has been cut in half
lengthwise. The head or pegbox
of the instrument is
characteristically bent at a right
angle to the neck or fingerboard.
All lutes have a "rosette"
which corresponds to the
sounding hole of a guitar and is
carved directly into the wood of
the instrument. These are
sometimes quite ornate and
require a great deal of
craftsmanship to create. Lutes
normally have anywhere from
11 to 15 strings although they
may have more. The lute that
belonged to J.S. Bach, who was
an avid lute fan, had 24 strings.
Oriental Instrument
The lute was originally an
oriental instrument that was
brought to Europe in the 12th
and 13the centuries by the
crusaders, which just goes to
show that the crusaders were

pursuing things other than
religious infidels. It was
originally played in Europe, as it
was in the Orient, with a quill or
pluctrum, but during the late
15th century it was found that
by using the fingers instead of a
quill more than one string could
be played at once. The
instrument became more
versatile since more than one
melodic line could be played at a
time.
This and the fact that a lute
was much more portable than an
organ created a school of
composition that lasted for 300
years through the Medieval,
Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo,
and Classical eras of music
history. However, lute
enthusiasts consider the 16th
century as the Golden Era of
lute music.
Decline of the Lute
After the 17th century the
popularity of the lute declined;
the last music written for the
lute was a series of variations on
an aria from Mozart's "Don
Giovanni." But today interest is
again being stimulated by groups
such as the "Lute Society of
America"and by workshops
such as the one given here at
Stanford.
