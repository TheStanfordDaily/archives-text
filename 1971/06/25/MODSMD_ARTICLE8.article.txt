Even the most critical of
Stanford students would have a
hard time arguing that this
campus does not have an almost
ideal geographical location, at
least as far as entertainment
possibilities are concerned.
On almost any night, a
number of films, dramatic and
musical events are ocurring
within surrounding local
communities. And 35 miles to
the north is one of the true
entertainment capitals of the
world.
This weekend is as busy as
most with hundreds of
entertainment events going on
within an hour's drive of the
campus. I will try to focus on
those events going on in close
proximity to the campus as well
as an event of special interest
happening in San Francisco.
On Tuesday this column
looked at all the on-campus
events we had heard about for
the week. As is usually the case,
a few more things have popped
up. Tonight at 7:30 and 10:00
p.m. a Laurel and Hardy film
Way Out West, will be shown in
Memorial Auditorium in a
benefit showing for KZSIJ. Two
Charlie Chaplin shorts, two W.C.

United States, France, Iran,
Finland and other countries will
be shown. The program is
presented by the Stanford
University Photography Club

and $1 for students.

on-campus events can be found
in the June 22 Daily. I now want
to look at some activities going
on ir. local communities.
