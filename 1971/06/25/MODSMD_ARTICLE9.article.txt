# See 'Buck Rogers' Twice Every Week
## 
### 
As part of the Summer
Institute in Science Fiction &
Fantasy, the Office of Public
Events is presenting the Second
Annual Science Fiction,
Fantasy, & Fact Film Series.
Fifteen films—each having
some connection with the
science, science fiction, or
fantasy genres- will be presented
during the eight week summer
quarter, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Each film will be
shown twice, once at 4:00 p.m.
and again at 7:30 p.m., in
Cubberley Auditorium.
Admission is $.80 for the earlier
showing and $1.00 for the later.
Season tickets (available at the
Tresidder Box Office) are $9.00
and $10.00.
The Daily will preview each
week's films in its Tuesday issue.
As each film will be preceded by
"A Thrilling Episode of 'Buck
Rogers'," perhaps this is the
time to preview "Buck Rogers."
"Buck Rogers," with the
übiquitous Larry (Buster)
Crabbe in the title role, was
filmed in the 1939 under the
direction of Ford Beebe and
Saul A. Goodkin. Beebe had
collaborated the year before
with Robert Hill in directing the
second of the Flash Gordon
series, "Flash Gordon's Trip to
Mars," starring you-know-who.
Universal produced the films,
based on the "Buck Rogers"
comic strip of Dick Calkins.
To quote from John Baxter
in "Science Fiction in the
Cinima" (Paperback Library
Edition, 1970), "With certain
notable exceptions the serial
field is the worst endowed area
of SF film, presenting a drab and
arid face that only the uncritical
can accept."
Baxter continues, "Despite a
pretense towards scientific
accuracy, the serials drew
heavily on the swashbuckling
fantasy of the pulps, as well as
other older models. In costumes
recalling the medieval clothing of
Lang's 'Nibelungen' and opposed
by spear-carrying enemies in

similarly Wagnerian winged
helmets and boots, Crabbe was
the personification of the epic
hero of European mythology', a
pure-minded warrior vanquishing
by force of virtue the evils that
surround him.
"Significantly, the menaces
concocted to oppose Flash and
Buck often derived from the
popular SF film theme, loss of
individuality. Ming attempts
frequently to confine Flash
physically and mentally rather
than kill him, while the Zuggs of
'Buck Rogers' and the Incense of
Forgetfulness employed in
'Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars'
threaten mindlessness or are
threatening because of it.
''Constructed from
preformed elements, the Flash
Gordon and Buck Rogers serials
are classic examples of
tinker-toy production, though in
this case the models come from
other fields as well as from
within SF. Bits of old SF
features, costumes from earlier
serials, lines from the comics
themselves, extracts from
Nordic, Anglo-Saxon and
American mythology, even a
ballet sequence from Dimitri
Bucholowetszki's 'The Midnight
Sun' are employed to create a
jackdaw world of fantasy that is
nevertheless coherent and
fascinating."
