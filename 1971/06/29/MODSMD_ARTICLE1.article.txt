## Solomon To Aid President 
### DAVID ELKIND 
A comic photograph hangs on a
bulletin board in the Business School.
Five cowboys hold Ezr« Solomon
(Dean Witter Professor of Finance at
the Business School) at gunpoint, with
a hangman's noose around his neck, as
Solomon displays a poster reading
"Wanted Dead or Alive, Ezra
Solomon."
There is some reality to the posed
picture.
Earlier this month the Senate
accepted the recommendation of the
Committee on Banking and approved
President Nixon's nomination of
Solomon to the influential,
three-member President's Council of
Economic Advisors (CEA).
Very much wanted and captured,
the 51-year old Solomon has an
18-month leave of absence from
Stanford and will be going to
Washington at the end of the summer
to fill the vacant seat on the Council
left by Hendrick Houthakker.
Houthakker is returning to his teaching
post at Harvard.
Born in Burma
Solomon was born in Burma. As a
21-year-old tutor in economics at the
University of Rangoon, he was forced
to flee to India on foot with his family
when the Japanese invaded in 1941. He
served there for five years with the
Burma Division of the Royal Naval
Volunteer Reserve.
After the war he came to the U.S. as
a Burma state scholar and earned a
doctorate in finance at the University
of Chicago.
During his student years in Chicago,
the Burmese government changed
hands and Solomon decided to remain
in the U.S.
He taught at Chicago until 1961,
when he came to Stanford as founding
director of the International Center for
the Advancement of Management
Education, a training center for
business students from developing
nations headquartered in the Business
School.
The Flying Scholar
Widely regarded as one of the top
scholars in corporate financial
management and an expert in
international finance, Solomon has
been shuttling between Stanford and
Washington for the past 18 months as a
member of the Presidential Commission
on Financial Structure and Regulation.
Although Solomon's appointment is
not expected to make any major shifts
in Administration policy, he indicated
to the Senate Banking Committee that
he might favor personal tax cuts and
wage-price controls if the economy
does not begin performing better.
He also went beyond the current
Administration policy by showing
interest in moderately devaluating the

dollar by letter it "float" down in
foreign currency markets.
Solomon said that since November,
1970, "economic activity has expanded
and it has expanded rapidly." But, he
pointed out, the Gross National
Product (GNP) has grown slower than
planned.
"Normally at this point the
consumer should be showing signs of
spending and he isn't now," he said.
"Normally the consumer is the key to
the economy."
Insecure Consumers
Solomon blamed high
unemployment and the fact that "he
hasn't seen definitive abatement of
inflation," for the consumers
reluctance to spend.
He said the strong inflationary
pressures that existed in the last quarter
of 1968 have been "diffused."
However, he admitted that the May
unemployment figure of 6.2 percent
was "for me, quite a bit of a surprise."
Although the expert in economic
and financial forecasting has declined
to make predictions, he has said it
would take "a super recovery to get
unemployment down" with a
continued growth of about two percent
per annum in the labor force.
Responding to the interrogation of
Banking Committee member Sen.
William Proxmire (D-Wis.), Solomon
said that a speedup of personal income
tax relief now scheduled for 1972 and
1973 is "certainly one of the things I

would favor if the economy didn't
show the signs (of expansion that) we
would expect in the second quarter.
"The guesses are that the GNP in the
second quarter will grow about $20
billion, a little below the sort of
scenario people had in mind."
Solomon explained that if the rate
of inflation continued to increase
beyond this quarter and that if
unemployment kept rising "from now
on out," the combination would
definitely persuade him that the U.S.
would need a tough "incomes policy,"
which might include wage-price
controls.
Solomon's suggestion to "float" the
dollar would, in effect, mean
devaluation. The dollar's international
value so far has been stabilized by other
governments' purchasing them at a
fixed price and cashing them in for
gold, at $35 an ounce. Some countries
have been pressing the U.S. to devalue
the dollar, to forestall their having to
revalue their own currency upward.

LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—The varmint in the center, with the hemp necktie, is Ezra Solomon, Stanford Business School
professor. Recently tapped by the Nixon Administration for the Council of Economic Advisors, Solomon will be headin' into
the sunrise for an 18-month leave of absence.
Solomon's first interest is teaching
at Stanford, and he remarked that
working with the CEA will be "a useful
and interesting sort of thing to do."
He said "there's no question in my
mind" that he will be returning to
Stanford after his 18-month leave of
absence and that he planned to leave
his office "intact."
Even between trips to Washington,
Solomon said he did "a hell of a lot of
work" last quarter. Besides the usual
Ph.D. students he advised, Solomon
taught three seminars in finance,
including a course in international
finance which attracted 150 students.
