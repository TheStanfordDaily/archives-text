## Bob Love Ain't No Hippy 
### 
Nicholas von hoffman

WICHITA, Kan. — Bob Love is
another one of those people who
has given up on our political
system and dropped out of it. But
Bob Love ain't no hippy. He's a
millionaire, owner of a large paper
box manufacturing company, a
former member of the board of
the National Association of
Manufacturers and a founder of
the John Birch Society. At the age
of 48, he wears his whitening hair
very short.
Like the liberal McCarthy
youth, Bob has had his Snows of
New Hampshire with a similar
subsequent disillusionment with
what politics can accomplish: "I
started out in 1 948 when I
debated the right to work law
with a labor leader, the first one
I'd ever seen ... I worked for 10
years on right to work legislation
and made it part of the state
constitution, but they never
passed any implementing
legislation. Three governors lied to
me about it, and this is a
rock-ribbed Republican state, but
there's more compulsory
unionism now than there would
be if we hadn't passed the law."
During his political period Bob

Love also tried Goldwater, but, he
says,"I got disillusioned with him
in '58 when he said socialism
might be the best way for South
America to go."
Energy Gone
That did it for a man like Love
with his aborrence of government
power. He dropped out and hasn't
had anything to do with electoral

Love is so far right he's
coming out the other side

politics since: "I don't even have
the energy to fight them any
more. I can't. They got 60 percent
of my income which represents 60
percent of my energy. There
would be nothing left of me to
fight them with . . . Once you've
taken something from the
government you can't object to
what they do. That's why I won't
vote. When you participate in the
process you sanction it. The most
fun in the world is when I tell a
politician, 'Sure, I'll support you
if you promise me that if you're
elected you won't serve."
All of this marks Bob Love as a
purist, and all the rest of us shy
away from purists because there is
something inherently daffy about
the undeviating application of any
idea, any principle to human
society. Yet there is a part of the
Bob Loves of this country who
speak to a part of us. From time
to time, many of us have
entertained ourselves with his
fantasies, with how delightful it
would be if they held one of their
elections and nobody came.
But our fantasy is Bob Love's
hope: "Every year a smaller
percentage of the eligible voters
atually vote. Now they've even
introduced a bill in the state
legislature to give people a tax
credit to get them to vote."
Again, there's something in
what the man says. Why the
quadrennial hysteria to get people
registered, why the urgent mass
media appeals telling us that "it
doesn't matter who you vote for,

but vote!" A very strange slogan
when you think about it. Why
would the government and all the
ancillary institutions backing up
the government tell people that it
doesn't matter who they vote for
as long as they vote?
Why Vote?
Don't they care who wins
those elections? Or is the purpose

of all this voting to resanctify the
system, to recertify it as valid and
believalbe and democratic?
Perhaps this is why the Russians
make such a to-do about getting
99 percent of the voters out in an
election where only one guy is
running. If half the people stayed
home they'd be saying something,
wouldn't they? That's Bob Love's
point, the same one that the
Leftists and the Wallacites have
been making. In fact, so many
seem to feel this way, you are
forced to speculate if our current
politics of small men with small
differences has any support once
you go about 10 rungs down the
ladder from the top.
Love, of course, can't be said
to be typical of any major
grouping. He is so far right he's
coming out the other side. So,
while it's hard to say whether he
quit or was expelled from the
John Birch Society, he is out of it
because his political values are too
extreme even for them. The
parting of the ways came on May
12, 19 68, when Love and a small
group of friends bought a
full-page ad in the Wichita Eagle
and Beacon to proclaim in the
loudest, biggest print: "Let's Get
Out of Vietnam, NOW!"
The ad advanced a lot to the
standard reasons for ending the
war, but its greatest emphasis was
on the proposition that if we keep
on fighting it, the spoils of our
victory will be our own
enslavement and that of the South
Vietnamese. "In the name of

freedom abroad, we are being
enslaved at home," it declares as it
ticks off such items as
conscription, high taxation and
regulation.
It also argues that the South
Vietnamese government has
accepted the main political
objectives of the Communist
North: "Property and income
from property to be controlled by
the state, a progressive or
graduated income tax,
centralization of credit in the
hands of the state, free education
of all children in government
schools, control of the means of
production, centralization of the
means of communication and
transportation in thyhands of the
state."
Humanity, Not Property
This is pretty much the
Nixon' Humphrey platform but
not Love's, a man who wouldn't
go along with it even if the John
Birch Society did. That doesn't
necessarily make Love a batty
millionaire with a lot of fancy
rationalizations for not having to
pay taxes. A smart businessman
can make more money off the
government than he has to pay
back on April 15 th.
' No, beyond his self-interest,
he's smitten with the ancient idea
that human rights are dependent
on property—not corporate
rights. The New Left and New
Liberalism has taught us to choose
between the two, to think of
them in conflict, but an older
political science tells us that
property rights enforce and make
real human rights, that we are
only as free as what we own is.
That doesn't mean much for
the millions of people who don't
own anything. For them Bob
Love can't have much to say.
They can appreciate the
libertarian anarchy of his ideas
but they don't have the property
to live like he does when he says,
"I have nothing to do with the
government, nothing to do with
the public sector; I'm not one of
those who denounces socialism
and then takes their money, but I
have to admit I still drive on
government roads. I can't avoid
it."

make such a to-do about getting
99 percent of the voters out in an
election where only one guy is
running. If half the people stayed
home they'd be saying something,
wouldn't they? That's Bob Love's
point, the same one that the
Leftists and the Wallacites have
been making. In fact, so many
seem to feel this way, you are
forced to speculate if our current
politics of small men with small
differences has any support once
you go about 10 rungs down the
ladder from the top.
Love, of course, can't be said
to be typical of any major
grouping. He is so far right he's
coming out the other side. So,
while it's hard to say whether he
quit or was expelled from the
John Birch Society, he is out of it
because his political values are too
extreme even for them. The
parting of the ways came on May
12, 19 68, when Love and a small
group of friends bought a
full-page ad in the Wichita Eagle
and Beacon to proclaim in the
loudest, biggest print: "Let's Get
Out of Vietnam, NOW!"
The ad advanced a lot to the
standard reasons for ending the
war, but its greatest emphasis was
on the proposition that if we keep
on fighting it, the spoils of our
victory will be our own
enslavement and that of the South
Vietnamese. "In the name of

freedom abroad, we are being
enslaved at home," it declares as it
ticks off such items as
conscription, high taxation and
regulation.
It also argues that the South
Vietnamese government has
accepted the main political
objectives of the Communist
North: "Property and income
from property to be controlled by
the state, a progressive or
graduated income tax,
centralization of credit in the
hands of the state, free education
of all children in government
schools, control of the means of
production, centralization of the
means of communication and
transportation in thyhands of the
state."
Humanity, Not Property
This is pretty much the
Nixon' Humphrey platform but
not Love's, a man who wouldn't
go along with it even if the John
Birch Society did. That doesn't
necessarily make Love a batty
millionaire with a lot of fancy
rationalizations for not having to
pay taxes. A smart businessman
can make more money off the
government than he has to pay
back on April 15 th.
' No, beyond his self-interest,
he's smitten with the ancient idea
that human rights are dependent
on property—not corporate
rights. The New Left and New
Liberalism has taught us to choose
between the two, to think of
them in conflict, but an older
political science tells us that
property rights enforce and make
real human rights, that we are
only as free as what we own is.
That doesn't mean much for
the millions of people who don't
own anything. For them Bob
Love can't have much to say.
They can appreciate the
libertarian anarchy of his ideas
but they don't have the property
to live like he does when he says,
"I have nothing to do with the
government, nothing to do with
the public sector; I'm not one of
those who denounces socialism
and then takes their money, but I
have to admit I still drive on
government roads. I can't avoid
it."

WICHITA, Kan. — Bob Love is
another one of those people who
has given up on our political
system and dropped out of it. But
Bob Love ain't no hippy. He's a
millionaire, owner of a large paper
box manufacturing company, a
former member of the board of
the National Association of
Manufacturers and a founder of
the John Birch Society. At the age
of 48, he wears his whitening hair
very short.
Like the liberal McCarthy
youth, Bob has had his Snows of
New Hampshire with a similar
subsequent disillusionment with
what politics can accomplish: "I
started out in 1 948 when I
debated the right to work law
with a labor leader, the first one
I'd ever seen ... I worked for 10
years on right to work legislation
and made it part of the state
constitution, but they never
passed any implementing
legislation. Three governors lied to
me about it, and this is a
rock-ribbed Republican state, but
there's more compulsory
unionism now than there would
be if we hadn't passed the law."
During his political period Bob

Love also tried Goldwater, but, he
says,"I got disillusioned with him
in '58 when he said socialism
might be the best way for South
America to go."
Energy Gone
That did it for a man like Love
with his aborrence of government
power. He dropped out and hasn't
had anything to do with electoral

Love is so far right he's
coming out the other side

politics since: "I don't even have
the energy to fight them any
more. I can't. They got 60 percent
of my income which represents 60
percent of my energy. There
would be nothing left of me to
fight them with . . . Once you've
taken something from the
government you can't object to
what they do. That's why I won't
vote. When you participate in the
process you sanction it. The most
fun in the world is when I tell a
politician, 'Sure, I'll support you
if you promise me that if you're
elected you won't serve."
All of this marks Bob Love as a
purist, and all the rest of us shy
away from purists because there is
something inherently daffy about
the undeviating application of any
idea, any principle to human
society. Yet there is a part of the
Bob Loves of this country who
speak to a part of us. From time
to time, many of us have
entertained ourselves with his
fantasies, with how delightful it
would be if they held one of their
elections and nobody came.
But our fantasy is Bob Love's
hope: "Every year a smaller
percentage of the eligible voters
atually vote. Now they've even
introduced a bill in the state
legislature to give people a tax
credit to get them to vote."
Again, there's something in
what the man says. Why the
quadrennial hysteria to get people
registered, why the urgent mass
media appeals telling us that "it
doesn't matter who you vote for,

but vote!" A very strange slogan
when you think about it. Why
would the government and all the
ancillary institutions backing up
the government tell people that it
doesn't matter who they vote for
as long as they vote?
Why Vote?
Don't they care who wins
those elections? Or is the purpose

of all this voting to resanctify the
system, to recertify it as valid and
believalbe and democratic?
Perhaps this is why the Russians
make such a to-do about getting

millionaire, owner of a large paper
box manufacturing company, a
former member of the board of
the National Association of
Manufacturers and a founder of
the John Birch Society. At the age
of 48, he wears his whitening hair
very short.
Like the liberal McCarthy
youth, Bob has had his Snows of
New Hampshire with a similar
subsequent disillusionment with
what politics can accomplish: "I
started out in 1 948 when I
debated the right to work law
with a labor leader, the first one
I'd ever seen ... I worked for 10
years on right to work legislation
and made it part of the state
constitution, but they never
passed any implementing
legislation. Three governors lied to
me about it, and this is a
rock-ribbed Republican state, but
there's more compulsory
unionism now than there would
be if we hadn't passed the law."
During his political period Bob

Love also tried Goldwater, but, he
says,"I got disillusioned with him
in '58 when he said socialism
might be the best way for South
America to go."
Energy Gone
That did it for a man like Love
with his aborrence of government
power. He dropped out and hasn't
had anything to do with electoral

Love is so far right he's
coming out the other side

politics since: "I don't even have
the energy to fight them any
more. I can't. They got 60 percent
of my income which represents 60
percent of my energy. There
would be nothing left of me to
fight them with . . . Once you've
taken something from the
government you can't object to
what they do. That's why I won't
vote. When you participate in the
process you sanction it. The most
fun in the world is when I tell a
politician, 'Sure, I'll support you
if you promise me that if you're
elected you won't serve."
All of this marks Bob Love as a
purist, and all the rest of us shy
away from purists because there is
something inherently daffy about
the undeviating application of any
idea, any principle to human
society. Yet there is a part of the
Bob Loves of this country who
speak to a part of us. From time
to time, many of us have
entertained ourselves with his
fantasies, with how delightful it
would be if they held one of their
elections and nobody came.
But our fantasy is Bob Love's
hope: "Every year a smaller
percentage of the eligible voters
atually vote. Now they've even
introduced a bill in the state
legislature to give people a tax
credit to get them to vote."
Again, there's something in
what the man says. Why the
quadrennial hysteria to get people
registered, why the urgent mass
media appeals telling us that "it
doesn't matter who you vote for,

but vote!" A very strange slogan
when you think about it. Why
would the government and all the
ancillary institutions backing up
the government tell people that it
doesn't matter who they vote for
as long as they vote?
Why Vote?
Don't they care who wins
those elections? Or is the purpose

of all this voting to resanctify the
system, to recertify it as valid and
believalbe and democratic?
Perhaps this is why the Russians
make such a to-do about getting
99 percent of the voters out in an
election where only one guy is
running. If half the people stayed
home they'd be saying something,
wouldn't they? That's Bob Love's
point, the same one that the
Leftists and the Wallacites have
been making. In fact, so many
seem to feel this way, you are
forced to speculate if our current
politics of small men with small
differences has any support once
you go about 10 rungs down the
ladder from the top.
Love, of course, can't be said
to be typical of any major
grouping. He is so far right he's
coming out the other side. So,
while it's hard to say whether he
quit or was expelled from the
John Birch Society, he is out of it
because his political values are too
extreme even for them. The
parting of the ways came on May
12, 19 68, when Love and a small
group of friends bought a
full-page ad in the Wichita Eagle
and Beacon to proclaim in the
loudest, biggest print: "Let's Get
Out of Vietnam, NOW!"
The ad advanced a lot to the
standard reasons for ending the
war, but its greatest emphasis was
on the proposition that if we keep
on fighting it, the spoils of our
victory will be our own
enslavement and that of the South
Vietnamese. "In the name of

freedom abroad, we are being
enslaved at home," it declares as it
ticks off such items as
conscription, high taxation and
regulation.
It also argues that the South
Vietnamese government has
accepted the main political
objectives of the Communist
North: "Property and income
from property to be controlled by
the state, a progressive or
graduated income tax,
centralization of credit in the
hands of the state, free education
of all children in government
schools, control of the means of
production, centralization of the
means of communication and
transportation in thyhands of the
state."
Humanity, Not Property
This is pretty much the
Nixon' Humphrey platform but
not Love's, a man who wouldn't
go along with it even if the John
Birch Society did. That doesn't
necessarily make Love a batty
millionaire with a lot of fancy
rationalizations for not having to
pay taxes. A smart businessman
can make more money off the
government than he has to pay
back on April 15 th.
' No, beyond his self-interest,
he's smitten with the ancient idea
that human rights are dependent
on property—not corporate
rights. The New Left and New
Liberalism has taught us to choose
between the two, to think of
them in conflict, but an older
political science tells us that
property rights enforce and make
real human rights, that we are
only as free as what we own is.
That doesn't mean much for
the millions of people who don't
own anything. For them Bob
Love can't have much to say.
They can appreciate the
libertarian anarchy of his ideas
but they don't have the property
to live like he does when he says,
"I have nothing to do with the
government, nothing to do with
the public sector; I'm not one of
those who denounces socialism
and then takes their money, but I
have to admit I still drive on
government roads. I can't avoid
it."
