Editor, THE DAILY:
That Stanford University
administrative pawns would try to
destroy, isolate and wipe out any
movement which united Stanford
workers in common cause, is no
surprise. We have all seen Richard
Lyman's two-faced response to
the anti-war movement and its
demands regarding University
complicity.
The Administration's dirty
double dealing throughout the
past year has ripped the mask of
phoney liberalism to shreads.
Currently, the firings, primarily of
workers associated with
Venceremos, are the first step to
wipe out such efforts as the
unionization drive, the battle
against institutional racism, the
anti-war and anti-imperialist
organizing of students and
workers and others.
When gentle arm twisting and
the legal system don't work for
the fascists, they move on—as in
Vietnam—to firings, jailings,
suppression, massive police
intervention—like Sgt. Pronske's
now weekly raids on the
movement. The obvious and only
reasonably workable response to
intimidation and terror is to fight
back.
History in general, but
particularly in the er*a of rampant
fascism under Germany and Italy
has taught us that to turn your
back to the fascists, to even dare
to run away, is to invite death.
If we understand and accept
the need for a militant defense
against imperial policemen like
Lyman and Wilson, we will
understand the importance of
moving strongly and boldly at this
point to protect the jobs of those
arbitrarily fired over the heads of
supervisors and bosses. This
behavior by the pigs is more than
intolerable, for it obviously
threatens the job security of every
worker on the campus. No trial,
no legalisms, no nothing: you're
fired.
Take the case of John Dolly, a
laboratory assistant in Len
Herzenberg's Genetics lab. The
usual grievance procedure, puts
the grievance in the hands of a
committee made up of one
administrator, a person in the
department selected by the
department chairman, and a
person chosen by the worker. This
procedure usually works against
the worker, particularly if there is

any political question involved.
That's why it exists. In John's
case however, most of the higher
people in Genetics are either
neutral or sympathetic to the
worker's cause.
Josh Lederberg, whose political
values (as well as the rest of his
brain) are computerized to
eliminate humane or
compassionate feelings, is
chairman of the Genetics
Department. Josh decided or at
least he has said he will decide,
that he cannot appoint anyone
from his department to John's
Grievance Committee.
Although he is a "famous"
Nobel Laureate, Josh Lederberg's
job at Stanford is nothing more
than a low level Administrative
button pusher. With the support
of Lyman and Wilson, he has the
"authority" to invoke a "legal
loophole" which will put two
Administrative appointees on
John's Grievance committee
instead of one. So that will take
care of John. They wish!
John and the other workers
involved are sure to fight back.
They need and want their jobs. Of
course, John, Jeannie Dolly and
the others, who participated in
the Hospital sit-in to save Sam
Bridges' job from the same
arbitrary bullshit, face jail
sentences as part of the Stanford
33. Can we forget that peaceful
sit-in on which the Administration

said it "won't call the police in."
Can we ignore efforts to single out
Black and Brown people for the
heaviest charges and most brutal
treatment?
It is time to shut Stanford
down around limited goals. Not to
end the war, but just to get back 5
jobs. For Stanford workers, the
risks are obvious yet necessary.
Join the 5 in action ... now so
that it will be harder to fire more
workers later. Turn 5 into 500
with no firings. It has happened
before when people unite. It will
happen again. Fight back.
