The following statement by Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice
provost and adviser to the President, was circulated on the
steps of Encina Hall Friday noon, June 25:
Supporters of the five employees who were dismissed for
participating in the occupation of the Stanford University
Hospital on April 9, 1971, have offered a set of reasons why
they should not have been dismissed, and a set of demands.
They should be answered.
Reasons why employees should not have been dismissed in
clude:
1. Because they could not answer any investigation without
jeopardizing their court appearances.
Answer: Mr. Nelson answered this point in this morning's
Daily (June 25]. To repeat: These individuals are
not charged by the University with any crime. The
University conducted its own investigation and
found cause for dismissal separate from the investi
gation conducted by the civil authorities and the
criminal charges that resulted from it. As Mr. Nelson
said, the University's action "follows from the gen
eral rule in cases where criminal and civil actions
result from the single set of events. To argue other
wise is to say that no private party can remedy a
wrong against it in a timely manner if the wrong is
alleged by the State to involve criminal conduct or,
indeed, if the individual who committeed the act
believes that answering for it might make him liable
to criminal charges. That is an untenable position."
2. The firings were illegal because Guide Memo 22.8 gives
departments, not the personnel director, the right to terminate
an employee.
Answer: Guide Memo 22.8 is addressed to the ordinary case
in which misconduct arises from the immediate em
ployment situation where the supervisor or depart
ment head has the best view of the matter. The
present cases, in contrast, involve conduct detri
mental to the University, but not emerging directly
from work performance. In such cases, the super
visor is not well placed to judge the action. The
authority of the Personnel director derives from the
President of the University, and the authority to
discharge is simply the reverse of the authority to
employ, clearly an act of the University, not of
individuals or units within it.
3. The term "unacceptable behavior" is too vague.
Answer: All five persons were given an opportunity to re
spond to the evidence against them. They were
charged with specific misconduct, and it cannot
seriously be argued that anyone is in doubt about
what that misconduct consisted of.
4. No employee should be fired without having an oppor
tunity for a grievance hearing before termination.
Answer: The point is arguable, but in the present circum

stances not relevant. Stanford's policy, followed in
this case, is to notify an employee of termination
and to provide two weeks notice or pay and the
opportunity for a prompt hearing. All parts of that
policy are being followed.
5. The actions constitute political harassment.
Answer: It is conduct that is at issue, not the cause in whose
name it was committed. The gap in time between
the conduct and the University's action resulted
from the determination to conduct a careful, in
dependent inquiry into the events and to give each
person involved an opportunity to discuss the mat
ter and bring forth any evidence in his behalf. All of
that took time, and it necessarily had to be done by
officials who had other responsibilities as well.
The answers to the demands follow from the foregoing.
1. That none be fired without having a chance to go through
grievance procedures.
Answer: All five employees have that opportunity. At the
time of writing this, two have tiled a grievance and
they will receive a prompt hearing. The others have
the same opportunity.
2. That the grievance procedure be restructured to give a more
representative balance to the group making the decisions.
Answer: It is not clear on its face what this demand means. It
is clear that the form of the grievance procedure,
like all other policies, is open to change and im
provement, and that mechanisms exist for receiving
proposals and recommending change. They existed
before these cases arose and they will continue to
exist after they are ended. They should be used.
J. That the Administration respect the parallel court appear
ances these Jive persons face and plan no hearings or grievance
procedures until their court trials are terminated.
Answer: The University's proceedings will continue for the
reasons given in Mr. Nelson's statement and sum
marized above.
4. That the University return to the departments and principal
investigators the right of originating termination processes, so
that no arbitrary firings occur.
Answer: The premises of this demand are defective. No right
has been taken from departments and principal in
vestigators and no arbitrary firings have occurred.
Units within the University have the same authority
conferred on them by the personnel rules before
these cases arose and employees including these
five—continue to be protected against arbitrary
action against them.
.5. Because the Jive persons allegedly accused of "unacceptable
behavior" were not given these considerations, the five persons
should be rehired immediately.
Answer: Whether any or all of the live will be rehired de
pends solely on the outcome of the grievance pro
ccdu re.

individuals or units within it.
3. The term "unacceptable behavior" is too vague.
Answer: All five persons were given an opportunity to re
spond to the evidence against them. They were
charged with specific misconduct, and it cannot
seriously be argued that anyone is in doubt about
what that misconduct consisted of.
4. No employee should be fired without having an oppor
tunity for a grievance hearing before termination.
Answer: The point is arguable, but in the present circum

stances not relevant. Stanford's policy, followed in
this case, is to notify an employee of termination
and to provide two weeks notice or pay and the
opportunity for a prompt hearing. All parts of that
policy are being followed.
5. The actions constitute political harassment.
Answer: It is conduct that is at issue, not the cause in whose
name it was committed. The gap in time between
the conduct and the University's action resulted
from the determination to conduct a careful, in
dependent inquiry into the events and to give each
person involved an opportunity to discuss the mat
ter and bring forth any evidence in his behalf. All of
that took time, and it necessarily had to be done by
officials who had other responsibilities as well.
The answers to the demands follow from the foregoing.
1. That none be fired without having a chance to go through
grievance procedures.
Answer: All five employees have that opportunity. At the
time of writing this, two have tiled a grievance and
they will receive a prompt hearing. The others have
the same opportunity.
2. That the grievance procedure be restructured to give a more
representative balance to the group making the decisions.
Answer: It is not clear on its face what this demand means. It
is clear that the form of the grievance procedure,
like all other policies, is open to change and im
provement, and that mechanisms exist for receiving
proposals and recommending change. They existed
before these cases arose and they will continue to
exist after they are ended. They should be used.
J. That the Administration respect the parallel court appear
ances these Jive persons face and plan no hearings or grievance
procedures until their court trials are terminated.
Answer: The University's proceedings will continue for the
reasons given in Mr. Nelson's statement and sum
marized above.
4. That the University return to the departments and principal
investigators the right of originating termination processes, so
that no arbitrary firings occur.
Answer: The premises of this demand are defective. No right
has been taken from departments and principal in
vestigators and no arbitrary firings have occurred.
Units within the University have the same authority
conferred on them by the personnel rules before
these cases arose and employees including these
five—continue to be protected against arbitrary
action against them.
.5. Because the Jive persons allegedly accused of "unacceptable
behavior" were not given these considerations, the five persons
should be rehired immediately.
Answer: Whether any or all of the live will be rehired de
pends solely on the outcome of the grievance pro
ccdu re.

The following statement by Robert M. Rosenzweig, vice
provost and adviser to the President, was circulated on the
steps of Encina Hall Friday noon, June 25:
Supporters of the five employees who were dismissed for
participating in the occupation of the Stanford University
Hospital on April 9, 1971, have offered a set of reasons why
they should not have been dismissed, and a set of demands.
They should be answered.
Reasons why employees should not have been dismissed in
clude:
1. Because they could not answer any investigation without
jeopardizing their court appearances.
Answer: Mr. Nelson answered this point in this morning's
Daily (June 25]. To repeat: These individuals are
not charged by the University with any crime. The
University conducted its own investigation and
found cause for dismissal separate from the investi
gation conducted by the civil authorities and the
criminal charges that resulted from it. As Mr. Nelson
said, the University's action "follows from the gen
eral rule in cases where criminal and civil actions
result from the single set of events. To argue other
wise is to say that no private party can remedy a
wrong against it in a timely manner if the wrong is
alleged by the State to involve criminal conduct or,
indeed, if the individual who committeed the act
believes that answering for it might make him liable
to criminal charges. That is an untenable position."
2. The firings were illegal because Guide Memo 22.8 gives
departments, not the personnel director, the right to terminate
an employee.
Answer: Guide Memo 22.8 is addressed to the ordinary case
in which misconduct arises from the immediate em
ployment situation where the supervisor or depart
ment head has the best view of the matter. The
present cases, in contrast, involve conduct detri
mental to the University, but not emerging directly
from work performance. In such cases, the super
visor is not well placed to judge the action. The
authority of the Personnel director derives from the
President of the University, and the authority to
discharge is simply the reverse of the authority to
employ, clearly an act of the University, not of
individuals or units within it.
