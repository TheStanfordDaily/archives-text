# Write For Daily
## 
### 
The Daily welcomes con
tributions from its readers in
the form of letters to the
editor, columns, or graphic
designs. Letters and columns
should be typed double-spaced
on a 60-space line, and the
author should be identified by
name and other relevant infor
mation. Names will be held
upon request.
Articles of 250 words or less

will be considered as letters to
the editor.
All items submitted will be
considered for publication.
However the Daily reserves the
right to edit pieces due to lack
of space restrictions, which are
tight. We will, when phone
numbers are provided, endeav
or to contact the author to
ascertain that the sense of the
article has been preserved.
