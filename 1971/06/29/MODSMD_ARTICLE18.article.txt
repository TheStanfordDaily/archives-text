# Stuttgart Ballet
## Romeo, Juliet Fall 
### GARY SALT 
Getting ready to see the
Stuttgart Ballet is not like getting
ready to do the laundry. Here we
have a company among the most
acclaimed in the world which only
two years ago this month, in a
series of blockbuster
performances at the Metropolitan,
stepped from virtual oblivion to
Olympus. So you tend to get
ready for them somehow and 1
suppose it is an attitude they
deserve.
All of which pre-performance
puffery made Saturday evening's
lackluster rendition of Romeo and
Juliet at the San Francisco Opera
House that much more
disappointing.
John Cranko's Romeo and
Juliet, one of several versions
using Prokofieff's score, is first,
one of the oldest ballets in the
company's repertoire, having been
first performed by them in 1962;
second, a combination of youth,
love, and death, the three most
unbeatable themes for the stage;
and third, it is. or it should be, a

magnificant showcase for
Cranko's genius and Stuttgart's
stars, in this case: Marcia Haydee,
Richard Cragun, Jan Stripling,
Egon Madsen, and David
Sutherland.
To be sure, Miss Haydee, for
whom Cranko created Romeo and
Juliet, was exquisite Saturday
night and more than rates her
reputation as one of the most
fastidious and talented ballerinas
of her generation.
However, Cranko has said
repeatedly on this American tour
that Americans' don't care for
short, abstract, plotless ballets as
much as they do for story-ballets,
fully plotted and costumed.
But does Cranko seriously
believe that audiences will endure
what they have to endure to see
the Stuttgart on a Saturday
evening because they have an
abiding concern with a story any
ten year-old knows? It's not of
course the "what" of the story
but the "how" of the story that
can sustain us. And therein lies
the disappointment.
For Romeo and Juliet in three

hours and thirteen scenes is
neither an especially complex
ballet nor is it one of noteworthy
technical virtuosity. We see little
of Miss Haydee and Mr. Cragun
except for one "pas de deux"
during the Balconey scene and an
"interrupted pas" on their
wedding morning; they are
submerged in a boring story.
In fact, what this ballet has the
least of is ballet. It is an actor's
dream, a superbly choreographed
dance-drama that depends more
on mime than dance for its crucial
narrative coherence.
Solos and variations are kept to
a minimum while group scenes,
ballroom and carnival tableaus,
Elizabethan dance motifs,
quasi-military formations of the
ensemble, and assorted
razzle-dazzle proliferates. All close
to ballet. Close, but no cigar.
None of which really proves
anything except that if Cranko's
assumption about Americans'
proclivity for lengthy, stunning,
super-ballets is correct, his Romeo
and Juliet will have taught us all a
good lesson.

headline Fillmore West's final show on the Fourth of July. Bill Graham has lined up a last week with
different shows every night featuring such groups as Quicksilver, the Grateful Dead, It's a Beautiful Day

But does Cranko seriously
believe that audiences will endure
what they have to endure to see
the Stuttgart on a Saturday
evening because they have an
abiding concern with a story any
ten year-old knows? It's not of
course the "what" of the story
but the "how" of the story that
can sustain us. And therein lies
the disappointment.
For Romeo and Juliet in three

hours and thirteen scenes is
neither an especially complex
ballet nor is it one of noteworthy
technical virtuosity. We see little
of Miss Haydee and Mr. Cragun
except for one "pas de deux"
during the Balconey scene and an
"interrupted pas" on their
wedding morning; they are
submerged in a boring story.
In fact, what this ballet has the
least of is ballet. It is an actor's
dream, a superbly choreographed
dance-drama that depends more
on mime than dance for its crucial
narrative coherence.
Solos and variations are kept to
a minimum while group scenes,
ballroom and carnival tableaus,
Elizabethan dance motifs,
quasi-military formations of the
ensemble, and assorted
razzle-dazzle proliferates. All close
to ballet. Close, but no cigar.
None of which really proves
anything except that if Cranko's
assumption about Americans'
proclivity for lengthy, stunning,
super-ballets is correct, his Romeo
and Juliet will have taught us all a
good lesson.

SANTANA ON THE FOURTH—Santana, seen here in a surprise appearance this spring at Frost, will
headline Fillmore West's final show on the Fourth of July. Bill Graham has lined up a last week with
different shows every night featuring such groups as Quicksilver, the Grateful Dead, It's a Beautiful Day
and many others.
Getting ready to see the
Stuttgart Ballet is not like getting
ready to do the laundry. Here we
have a company among the most
acclaimed in the world which only
two years ago this month, in a
series of blockbuster
performances at the Metropolitan,
stepped from virtual oblivion to
Olympus. So you tend to get
ready for them somehow and 1
suppose it is an attitude they
deserve.
All of which pre-performance
puffery made Saturday evening's
lackluster rendition of Romeo and
Juliet at the San Francisco Opera
House that much more
disappointing.
John Cranko's Romeo and
Juliet, one of several versions
using Prokofieff's score, is first,
one of the oldest ballets in the
company's repertoire, having been
first performed by them in 1962;
second, a combination of youth,
love, and death, the three most
unbeatable themes for the stage;
and third, it is. or it should be, a

magnificant showcase for
Cranko's genius and Stuttgart's
stars, in this case: Marcia Haydee,
Richard Cragun, Jan Stripling,
Egon Madsen, and David
Sutherland.
To be sure, Miss Haydee, for
whom Cranko created Romeo and
Juliet, was exquisite Saturday
night and more than rates her
reputation as one of the most
fastidious and talented ballerinas
of her generation.
However, Cranko has said
repeatedly on this American tour
that Americans' don't care for
short, abstract, plotless ballets as
much as they do for story-ballets,
fully plotted and costumed.
