# 'THX-1138' Highlights Films
## 
### STEVE UNGAR 
Visions of what the world will
be like when the End approaches,
or what it will be like if the End
doesn't approach, are offered in
this week's showings of the
Science Fiction, Fantasy & Fact
Film Series.
Playing tonight is the 1971 tale
of life in the future, "THX-1138";
Thursday will see the screening of
the 195 2 George Pal production
"When Worlds Collide." (NOTE
this is a change from the original
schedule.)
Both films show at 4 :00 p.m.
and 7:3 0 p.m., "THX-1138" in
Memorial Auditorium and "When
Worlds Collide" in Cubberly
Auditorium. Tickets may be
purchased at the door. A "Buck
Rogers" installment will precede
each showing.
"THX-1138" opened this
winter to mixed reviews from
both critics and audience. A story
of the world 600 years from now,
the film depicts a society in which
man has become the slave of his
machines, a world in which "love"
is a malediction.
Many critics have noted that
this offering of American
Zeotrope, the San Francisco-based
independent film producer, is
more a description of present
problems than a prediction of the
future. To quote Judith Crist of
New York Magazine "Science
fiction fans will find little science
and less imaginative fiction in a
25-century fantasy wherein

humans have become
white-overalled head-shaved
brainwashed, sedated and desexed
creatures."
Other critics were much
kinder, including The New York
Times and Newsweek. You'll have
to decide for yourself.
Old School
"When Worlds Collide" is
science fiction of the Old School.
Based on a "classic" of the early
30's, and produced by one of the
"masters" of the early 50's,
"When Worlds Collide" should be
interesting if only in a historical
sense.
According to Howard
Thompson of The New York
Times, "As in any science-fiction
produced by George Pal, it is the
technical trickery, special
photographic effects and color
that count. Here, the main
business is the preparation and
launching of a kind of
interplanetary ark, a marvel of
scientific ingenuity and
beep-beeping, intended to stave
off another planet closing in on
ours, in a screen play by Sydney
Boehm and directed by Rudolph
Mate, who paces the proceedings
evenly and with some credible
suspense.
"Naturally, our healthiest and
best-looking Americans board the
craft, including Richard Derr,
Barbara Rush and Peter Hanson,
along with Larry Keating, the key
scientist. Hard to swallow,

undoubtedly, but not hard to
take, for what it's worth."
John Baxter, in "Science
Fiction in the Cinema" says,
. . the original novel by Philip
Wylie and Edwin Balmer on which
it was based had been published in
the mid-Thirties, when many of sf
film's cliches had not been
established. DeMille was original!} .
to have produced the film itj
1934, but the project was shelveq
until George Pal dusted it of!
seventeen years later in the hope
that it would prove as successful
as his ambitious 'Destination
Moon.'
"Once again Pal poured money
into a lush colour production,
combining special effects with
an intelligent script (Sydney
Boehm) and remarkable colour
photography. 'When Worlds
Collide' is in some ways an
anachronism, presenting a Thirties
vision of Armageddon, but the
film's skill is incontestable."

that count. Here, the main
business is the preparation and
launching of a kind of
interplanetary ark, a marvel of
scientific ingenuity and
beep-beeping, intended to stave
off another planet closing in on
ours, in a screen play by Sydney
Boehm and directed by Rudolph
Mate, who paces the proceedings
evenly and with some credible
suspense.
"Naturally, our healthiest and
best-looking Americans board the
craft, including Richard Derr,
Barbara Rush and Peter Hanson,

scientist. Hard to swallow,

undoubtedly, but not hard to

John Baxter, in "Science

Wylie and Edwin Balmer on which
it was based had been published in

film's cliches had not been
established. DeMille was original!} .
to have produced the film itj
1934, but the project was shelveq
until George Pal dusted it of!
seventeen years later in the hope
that it would prove as successful
as his ambitious 'Destination
Moon.'
"Once again Pal poured money
into a lush colour production,
combining special effects with
an intelligent script (Sydney
Boehm) and remarkable colour
photography. 'When Worlds
Collide' is in some ways an
anachronism, presenting a Thirties
vision of Armageddon, but the
film's skill is incontestable."
Visions of what the world will
be like when the End approaches,
or what it will be like if the End
doesn't approach, are offered in
this week's showings of the
Science Fiction, Fantasy & Fact
Film Series.
Playing tonight is the 1971 tale
of life in the future, "THX-1138";
Thursday will see the screening of
the 195 2 George Pal production
"When Worlds Collide." (NOTE
this is a change from the original
schedule.)
Both films show at 4 :00 p.m.
and 7:3 0 p.m., "THX-1138" in
Memorial Auditorium and "When
Worlds Collide" in Cubberly
Auditorium. Tickets may be
purchased at the door. A "Buck
Rogers" installment will precede
each showing.
"THX-1138" opened this
winter to mixed reviews from
both critics and audience. A story
of the world 600 years from now,
the film depicts a society in which
man has become the slave of his
machines, a world in which "love"
is a malediction.
Many critics have noted that
this offering of American
Zeotrope, the San Francisco-based
independent film producer, is
more a description of present
problems than a prediction of the
future. To quote Judith Crist of
New York Magazine "Science
fiction fans will find little science
and less imaginative fiction in a
25-century fantasy wherein

humans have become
white-overalled head-shaved
brainwashed, sedated and desexed
creatures."
Other critics were much
kinder, including The New York
Times and Newsweek. You'll have
to decide for yourself.
Old School
"When Worlds Collide" is
science fiction of the Old School.
Based on a "classic" of the early
30's, and produced by one of the
"masters" of the early 50's,
"When Worlds Collide" should be
interesting if only in a historical
sense.
According to Howard
Thompson of The New York
Times, "As in any science-fiction
produced by George Pal, it is the
technical trickery, special
photographic effects and color
that count. Here, the main
business is the preparation and
launching of a kind of
interplanetary ark, a marvel of
scientific ingenuity and
beep-beeping, intended to stave
off another planet closing in on
ours, in a screen play by Sydney
