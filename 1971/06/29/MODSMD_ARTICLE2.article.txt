# Reformed Druids Revive 'Earth Mother' Worship
## 
### BOB REIK 
Only two Reformed Druids showed
up at Lake Lagunita by 7:30 Friday
evening. Because they required three
members, this reporter was requested
to join the weekly service of the
Stanford Reformed Druids of North
America.
"Druidism" according to Steve
Savitzky, the arch-Druid at Stanford "is
a sort of half-protest, half-social
organization, and half-religion. It
overlaps." Druids worship nature and
the Earth Mother because they believe
that nature is good in itself, and can aid
man in his individual search for truth.
Reformed Druidism began eight
years ago at Carleton College in

Minnesota. It has been on the Stanford
campus for the past two years. The
religion is based on an ancient Celtic
cult. When asked how Reformed
Druidism differed from the Celtic
brand, Savitzky replied, "We don't have
human sacrifices."
The Reformed Druids sacrifice
vegetable matter to the Earth Mother.
They also have given up some of the
more gruesome practices of the ancient
Celts, such as predicting the future
from the writhings of a recently
stabbed victim.
A basic part of the worship service is
the communal partaking of the "Waters
of Life." In preparation for this
communion, Savitzky and Dave Uggla,
the other regular Stanford Druid,

poured equal amounts of water and
Black and White Scotch into a small
glass. They explained that in Gaellic,
whiskey means "waters of life."
Last week's sacrifice to the Earth
Mother (who needs no sacrifice) was a
small branch from a nearby tree. The
service consisted of a short reading, the
sacrifice, communion, and meditation.
With the final blessing, Savitzky assured
the Grove that the Earth Mother had
accepted the sacrifice.
The religious beliefs and practices of
a new or "strange" religion are often
belittled in this era. But the Stanford
Druids show a simple faith and
solemnity in the midst of a materialistic
age.
Anyone may join the Reformed
Druids by coming to their weekly
Friday evening service at Lagunita
beach. One need not give up his
religious beliefs to become a Druid and
little is asked of him. The Druids on
campus are searching for new members,
but want no fanatics.
Savitzky pointed out that "Druidism
is one way among many. Anyone
telling a person that is way is wrong, is
wrong. Fanatics believe that they have
discovered the only way."
Savitzky summed up Druidism by
explaining that "Harmony with the
univerce is what religion is all about.
Our religion has a philosophy of
hanging loose and finding your own
path toward truth."

ART NOUVKAUâ€”BIack and rod spray-painted slogans, apparently protesting
recent worker firings, appeared on ten campus buildings Sunday night, the result
of midnight sign painters. The Stanford police report that the incidents took place
between 11:00 p.m. and 12:45 a.m. and that they apprehended three suspects,
including two Stanford students.
