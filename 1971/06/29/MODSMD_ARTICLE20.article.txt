# Fillmore- One Week More
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
(Ed. note—The Daily has
received more than one com
plaint that on Friday I mistakenly
said that Fillmore's last show
would be last Sunday night. As far
as 1 and anyone else knew at that
point it was supposed to be. Bill
Graham's office notified me today
that the extra shows were decided
on Saturday. The Daily apologizes
for its inability to read Bill
Graham's mind.)
Somehow it just didn't seem
right for Fillmore West to end its
six year existence with a bill
featuring Moby, Grape, Spencer
Davis and Flash Cadilac and the
Continental Kids. I'm not saying
that this was a really bad bill, but
for the last night it would've
seemed they could've lined up
some of the old "super-groups."
Well, never underestimate Bill
Graham. Instead of closing last
Sunday as announced, he has
decided to put on one final week
filled up with some of the
most-famous of the groups that
made Fillmore what it was and
immortalized the San Francisco
sound.
Starting tonight, Graham will
present six shows which will
feature some of the finest groups
who ever played at his rock

palace. Fillmore West will go out
in style.
Tonight will be the last of the
unpredictable Fillmore audition
nights with the following groups
scheduled to appear—Kwane and
the Kwanditos, Sawbuck and
Maid. Showtime will be the usual
8:30 p.m., as it will for all six
shows, but the admission tonight
only will be the usual Tuesday
night price of $ 1.00.
Tomorrow night will begin the
series of big-time shows, all with
$3.50 admission prices.
Tomorrow night the bill will
consist of It's A Beautiful Day,
Boz Scaggs and Grootna. It's A
Beautiful Day has been a favorite
Bay Area group for the last couple
of years and they feature a
beautiful electric violin.
Boz Scaggs is another local
group with a heavy brass sound. A
few months ago -they had a
big-selling album ("Moments")
and a heavily-played 4 5 ("We
Were Always Sweethearts").
Grootna is yet another San
Francisco group which has played
at Fillmore a number of times
recently.
Thursday night Graham will
present Cold Blood, Elvin Bishop
and Stoneground. Cold Blood
features female vocalist Lydia
Pense, backed by a hard-driving

brass section. Elvin Bishop is the
highly-popular "boogie-guitarist,"
who formed his own group after
playing with the Paul Butterfield
Blues Band.
The Dead
On Friday night the Grateful
Dead and the New Riders of the
Purple Sage will be featured. Back
in May, the Dead, one of the
original SF groups, played to
packed houses at Winterland. At
one of these concerts the
much-publicized incident in which
a number of people tripped on
some acid-spiked drinks occurred.
Immediately following the
incident, San Francisco Police
Chief A 1 Nelder said he would try
to revoke Graham's use permit at
Winterland. It has been said that
one of the reasons Graham has
decided to close Fillmore earlier
than the late summer or early fall
date originally announced, is
because of what he considers
"police harassment," since the
Dead concert.
Quicksilver, Hot Tuna and
Yogi Phlegm will headline
Saturday night's bill. Quicksilver
is yet another of the "original San
Francisco groups." Hot Tuna
includes two members of the old
Jefferson Airplane. Yogi Phlegm is
made up of members of the old
Sons of Chaplin.

Everything will come to a close
011 the 4 th of July. Scheduled to
appear Tower of
Power and "others."
Tickets will be on sale from 6
p.m. each night at Fillmore West
and also at the Burge Family
Bookstore, 155 0 Market, during
the day.

Graham's office notified me today
that the extra shows were decided
on Saturday. The Daily apologizes
for its inability to read Bill
Graham's mind.)
Somehow it just didn't seem
right for Fillmore West to end its
six year existence with a bill
featuring Moby, Grape, Spencer
Davis and Flash Cadilac and the
Continental Kids. I'm not saying
that this was a really bad bill, but
for the last night it would've
seemed they could've lined up
some of the old "super-groups."
Well, never underestimate Bill
Graham. Instead of closing last
Sunday as announced, he has
decided to put on one final week
filled up with some of the
most-famous of the groups that
made Fillmore what it was and
immortalized the San Francisco
sound.
Starting tonight, Graham will
present six shows which will
feature some of the finest groups
who ever played at his rock

palace. Fillmore West will go out
in style.
Tonight will be the last of the
unpredictable Fillmore audition
nights with the following groups
scheduled to appear—Kwane and
the Kwanditos, Sawbuck and
Maid. Showtime will be the usual
8:30 p.m., as it will for all six
shows, but the admission tonight
only will be the usual Tuesday
night price of $ 1.00.
Tomorrow night will begin the
series of big-time shows, all with
$3.50 admission prices.
Tomorrow night the bill will
consist of It's A Beautiful Day,
Boz Scaggs and Grootna. It's A
Beautiful Day has been a favorite
Bay Area group for the last couple
of years and they feature a
beautiful electric violin.
Boz Scaggs is another local
group with a heavy brass sound. A
few months ago -they had a
big-selling album ("Moments")
and a heavily-played 4 5 ("We
Were Always Sweethearts").
Grootna is yet another San
Francisco group which has played
at Fillmore a number of times
recently.
Thursday night Graham will
present Cold Blood, Elvin Bishop
and Stoneground. Cold Blood
features female vocalist Lydia
Pense, backed by a hard-driving

brass section. Elvin Bishop is the
highly-popular "boogie-guitarist,"
who formed his own group after
playing with the Paul Butterfield
Blues Band.
The Dead
On Friday night the Grateful
Dead and the New Riders of the
Purple Sage will be featured. Back
in May, the Dead, one of the
original SF groups, played to
packed houses at Winterland. At
one of these concerts the
much-publicized incident in which
a number of people tripped on
some acid-spiked drinks occurred.
Immediately following the
incident, San Francisco Police
Chief A 1 Nelder said he would try
to revoke Graham's use permit at
Winterland. It has been said that
one of the reasons Graham has
decided to close Fillmore earlier
than the late summer or early fall
date originally announced, is
because of what he considers
"police harassment," since the
Dead concert.
Quicksilver, Hot Tuna and
Yogi Phlegm will headline
Saturday night's bill. Quicksilver
is yet another of the "original San
Francisco groups." Hot Tuna
includes two members of the old
Jefferson Airplane. Yogi Phlegm is
made up of members of the old
Sons of Chaplin.

Everything will come to a close
011 the 4 th of July. Scheduled to
appear Tower of
Power and "others."
Tickets will be on sale from 6
p.m. each night at Fillmore West
and also at the Burge Family
Bookstore, 155 0 Market, during
the day.
(Ed. note—The Daily has
received more than one com
plaint that on Friday I mistakenly
said that Fillmore's last show
would be last Sunday night. As far
as 1 and anyone else knew at that
point it was supposed to be. Bill
Graham's office notified me today
that the extra shows were decided
on Saturday. The Daily apologizes
