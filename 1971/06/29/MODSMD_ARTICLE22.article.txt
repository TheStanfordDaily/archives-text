# POW's Sister Criticizes War Effort

Charging the Nixon Administration
with "using the prisoner of war issue,"
Miss Delia Alvarez, the sister of
American's longest captive Vietnam
prisoner of war, called for an
immediate end to the Vietnam War.
"My brother was sent to Vietnam
during the Kennedy Administration,"
recalled Miss Alvarez, while speaking in
the Round Room of Memorial Church
Sunday night. "He got captured during
the Johnson Administration and now
he is imprisoned during the Nixon
Administration. I don't want my
brother to be there for another
Administration."
Alvarez's brother, Navy Lt. Everett

Alvarez, Jr., was captured during the
Gulf of Tonkin incident on Aug. 5,
1964 and has been held prisoner by the
North Vietnamese ever since.
Repeatedly asking the audience of
just under 60 people "What do you do?
What can you do? How do you attack
this Vietnam monstrosity?" Miss
Alvarez called for the education of the
American people. "We must keep the
prisoner of war issue very much alive.
There is no reason to sacrifice my
brother's life and the lives of others."
"This is a very, very political war,"
commented the small, self-proclaimed
"extreme dissenter."
"One of the things that disturbs me,
is that the Nixon administration has a

$25 million advertising campaign
directed toward getting humane
treatment for American prisoners by
sending International Red Cross
representatives into the prisoner of war
camps for inspection. The prisoner of
war issue is a device to deceive the
American people. Why not use the $25
million to stop the war?"
Miss Alvarez has been touring the
country in an attempt to elicit support
from the relatives of other POW's for a
quick end to the war. According to
Alvarez, the response has been good
and they are moving toward a "family
unity." "There is a tremendous
emergence among the prisoner of war

families," commented Alvarez.
Quoting part of a recent letter from
her brother, Alvarez noted that after
nearly seven years her brother has not
given up hope. "Well, maybe some day,
soon," the letter concluded, "maybe,
I'll come home."
