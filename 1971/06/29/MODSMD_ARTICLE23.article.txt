Lonnie Gordon, 21, from San Luis
Obispo, was arrested by FBI agents in
Escondido Village last night on charges
of desertion from the U.S. Army.
Gordon, who has no connection
with the University, was visiting Mr.
and Mrs. Edwin Schum.
He was booked into North County
Jail late last night. A Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman
said that Gordon would be picked up
later today by military policemen.
The three FBI agents, who first
surrounded the apartment, could not
produce a warrant for Gordon's arrest.
But they claimed a fugitive warrant had
been issued for him.
No FBI spokesmen could be reached
for comment, but the move apparently
marks that agency's first open foray
onto the Stanford campus in years.
