# Minister Fund Begun
## 
### 
Joe Hardegree will be out of work
tomorrow. But supporters have begun a
fund-raising drive to keep the
Protestant minister at Stanford next
year. Hardegree is a self-proclaimed
Marxist.
Hardegree was fired from his job
with the United Christian Campus
Ministry in May, when the UCCM
budget was cut by its sponsors. He has
charged the budget was cut primarily to
end his activist ministry.
His supporters, including some
UCCM Board members, have raised
about $2000 in pledges so far, in a
drive to collect at least a subsistence
salary for Hardegree and his family
next year.
He says that he could continue his
work on campus with a $7500
contribution from the current
campaign.
The drive is scheduled to terminate
around registration when the group
plans to solicit small donations from
students. "If one or two thousand

students gave one or two dollars apiece
that should do it" according to
Hardegree.
UCCM has been asked if the
solicitation could be made under its
auspices. Although no decision has
been made, the minister is pessimistic
that UCCM will allow this. Hardegree
says that UCCIVTs sponsors feel he is
bad for its public image.
"James Corson, area secretary of the
United Ministry in Higher Education,
told me that if I stayed on in the
Campus Ministry the whole thing
would go down the tubes because
several denominations would pull out.
Everyone agrees that there should be a
place for people with my views in the
campus ministry and in the church, but
not here," Hardegree said.
Although his job officially ends
tomorrow, UCCM is paying Hardegree
through the summer as part of his
termination agreement. Before making
other plans he said he would wait for
the outcome of the fund-raising effort.
