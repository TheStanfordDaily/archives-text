"Liberating the Plaza" has again
become a summer goal for Palo Alto
street people, radicals, and high
schoolers. But Saturday night dances at
the Plaza, University Avenue at
Emerson, have so far been free of the
police confrontations which grew from
last year's parties.
The weekly crowds of about 300
have been deserting the tiny concrete
plaza by 11 p.m.—avoiding showdowns
with the city's curfew on amplified
music.
Curfew battles in the name of
freeing the plaza last summer grew into
trashing, injuries of demonstrators and
police, and arrests. One night, Palo Alto
police arrested 263 persons in a mass

bust of those on the scene.
A representative of the People's
Commune, which plans the dances, said
the volunteer bands decide for
themselves whether to play after the
curfew. None thus far has.
The Commune fills the band breaks
with radical announcements and films
of campus protests.
A commune member, asked why
radicals sponsor the dances, said, "This
brings people together. Otherwise they
scatter all over."
Palo Alto's Assistant Police Chief
Clarence Anderson said, "As they're
knocking off at 11:00, as far as I know
we've had no unusual police problems
from the area."
