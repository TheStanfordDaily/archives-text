# Rallies Support Workers
## 
### 
Continuing their protest against the firing of five
Stanford employees, about 150 persons demonstrated
Friday on the steps of Encina Hall and scheduled another
rally today at noon in front of Provost William Miller's
office. Sources close to the workers' movement who
refused to be identified told the Daily that if the
administration doesn't meet a demand to rehire the
workers, "retaliatory action" will be taken.
John Dolly, one of the fired workers, said that the
purpose of the rallies is to show the university
administration that "it can't get away with firing workers
for political reasons."
Members of the San Francisco Mime Troup are expected
to perform at 11:30 this morning in White Plaza after
which the rally will move to the quad in front of building
10 where Miller's office is located. In front of Miller's
office, a guerrilla theatre sponsored by the fired workers
will also take place.
The protesters include students, United Stanford
Employees and a group calling itself Employees United
Against Racism and Facism. Many are also members of
Venceremos, a revolutionary group based in Redwood City.

The five employees were dismissed last week with two
weeks pay in lieu of notice for "unacceptable behavior" in
the April 9 hospital sit-in. So far two have requested
grievance procedure hearings.
Robert Nelson, University director of personnel and
employee relations, watched the demonstrators Friday as
they parodied his actions in guerilla theater. He also
answered questions from the audience after some
hesitation. Nelson said he had taken the action on his own
initiative, following an independent investigation of the
incident over the past two months. While all those fired
face misdemeanor or felony charges, Nelson said that "the
courts have nothing to do with it," meaning the dismissals.
Asked if any employee who might be identified as
having participated in the hospital demonstration could be
subject to dismissal, Nelson said "yes."
Responding to several points made by faculty members
in a meeting with Miller last week, Vice Provost Robert M.
Rosenzweig issued a statement saying in part "The present
cases involve conduct detrimental to the University but not
emerging directly from work performance. In such cases,
the supervisor is not well placed to judge the action."
