# Survey Reveals Alumni Opinions On Acceptable Faculty Behavior
## 
### 
Alumni increasingly believe
"academic freedom" has been abused
by faculty members to defend their
unacceptable behavior, according to an
Alumni Association survey.
Sixty-seven percent of the 4,000
alumni polled in March and early
April—compared to 43 percent in Fall,
1969—believe "academic freedom may
be a good thing" but has been abused.
(Twenty-seven percent disagreed with
that stand and 6 percent answered,
"Don't know.")

Alumni Association Director
Thomas Newell, said, "Probably the
widespread publicity given the Franklin
case has had something to do with this
shift."
Professor Bruce Franklin has been
suspended and faces dismissal hearings
in September for his role in campus
protests.
Forty-three percent of the alumni
polled believe "faculty tenure is an
indispensable element in the protection
of academic freedom," while only 38

percent backed that position in 1969.
But Newell said the large number of
"don't knows" on the tenure question
(16 percent this year), shows alumni
"lack a firm grasp of what the issues are
in tenure."
Newell said the poll shows, "By and
large, Stanford alumni reject the notion
that the University itself should be
'activist' in a political sense."
But the alumni opposed last spring's
Faculty Senate resolution, which
condemned the Cambodian invasion,
by only a two percent margin.
Forty-seven percent rejected the
Senate's action, while 45 percent said
the professors acted "in an appropriate
manner."
In an earlier survey, a more clean-cut
73 percent of alumni had rejected the
more general notion that Stanford itself
should be vigorously involved in social
and political action.
Almost a third of the alumni
doubted the "university faculty itself
will be able to deal objectively with
cases involving alleged misconduct on
the part of a fellow faculty member."
But 60 percent trusted the faculty's
ability to discipline its members.
A breakdown of the results show a
"generation gap" between old and
recent alumni. While 84 percent of
pre-1960 alumni opposed faculty
discussion of controversial issues in
classrooms, only 43 percent of 1970
graduates took that stand.
In a breakdown of political
orientation, 62 percent of alumni,
terming themselves "liberals," called
tenure indispensable, while only 24
percent of "conservatives" held that
view.
