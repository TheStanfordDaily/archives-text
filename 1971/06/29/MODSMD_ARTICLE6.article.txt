# Want New Judges
## Sexism Motion Filed 
### 
Stanford graduate Dr. Nancy Cross
last Friday filed a motion in Federal
District Court at San Francisco to have
her lawsuit, charging Stanford
University with "sexist-racist" policies,
moved to a Circuit Court with both
men and women judges.
The motion asked that presiding
Judge Oliver J. Carter be disqualified in
her case, as well as every other judge in
the five-state Ninth-Circuit. According
to the submitted document, "numerous
judges of the Ninth District have been
of counsel and/or are so related to
attorneys of this action as to render it
improper for any of the judges to sit on
the trial."
The only two federal districts in the
United States having both men and
women judges are Mississippi's Western
District and New York's Southern
District, the motion explained.
The document also included charts
alleging the involvement of every

Ninth-District judge with Stanford,
either because he had attended the
school, had a relative who attended,
was a member of a law firm having a
Stanford graduate, or had some other
connection.
Dr. Cross, a Ph.D. in Chemistry from
Menlo Park, and Linda Krause of Palo
Alto, a systems programmer at
Stanford University Medical Center,
filed the original lawsuit in April.
The plaintiffs challenge alleged
sexual and racial discrimination in the
university's admission standards, which
limit the enrollment of females to 40
percent of total enrollment, and in its
financial aid distribution practices.
The suit was moved to federal court
because Elliot L. Richardson, secretary
of Health, Education, and Welfare was
named as a defendant, as were
President Lyman and the State of
California.
