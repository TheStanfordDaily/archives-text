# Pentagon Papers: Healthy Skepticism

The exposures of the Pentagon Papers
probably contain few surprises for the
majority of people in a community like
Stanford where the abundance of antiwar
literature, films, lectures, and teach-ins over
the past several years have already drawn the
outlines of the story in clear, well documented
strokes. Nonetheless, the exposure of the
whole picture, with primary documentation
showing the pervasive its-for-their-own-good
not-to-know attitude toward the public
knowledge of government policy brings a
certain sense of shock. It also raises a current
problem, which, if left unsolved, could spell
the end of government by the people in this
country: The problem, of course, is the extent
to which executive power can secure itself by
secrecy against the traditional checks and
balances which make it responsive to the will
of the governed.
Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon official who
turned his back on 13 years of loyalty to the
•security and secrecy system to make these
'documents public, explained in an interview
with C.B.S.'s Walter Cronkite, that it was not
only his revulsion of the Vietnam war which
influenced his decision to put the truth on
display, but the recognition that the executive
branch had extended its power far beyond
constitutionally allowable confines by the use
of secrecy to prevent even Congress from
knowing what was/is actually going on. As
Ellsberg explained, he decided to release the
papers because he feared a repeat now of the
'presidential year' policy, where publicly we

were de-escalating but privately planning to
escalate as soon as the political timing was
right.
'Healthy Skepticism'
Thanks to Ellsberg and the New York
Times, the American people are probably
developing a healthy skepticism all over the
country as to how far one should trust the
public pronouncements of Washington
bureaucrats. This could lead to a resurgence of
respect of Washington bureaucrats. This could
lead to a resurgence of respect for the Bill of
Rights, individual privacy and a cut-back of
governmental functioning in the area of
so-called "National Security." Right on!
But perhaps the inquisition into the
usurping of prerogatives traditionally allowed
to other constituencies by overractive
administrative bodies should not stop at
Washington. The Stanford Administration, for
example, has its own version of classified
information which extends far beyond the
traditional privacy accorded to salaries and
personnel information.
One has only to look at the history of the
decisions concerning the status of ROTC on
campus, in which the faculty was responsible
for decisions concerning academic credit for
ROTC. The Administration did not see fit to
bring to faculty attention, among other
relevant items, the new credit arrangements
being made by ROTC at other major schools.
Fortunately, courageous faculty members and
students ferreted out some of the truth before

the final decisions on whether to cut ROTC
loose were made. The story is far from over
yet, however, as the Administration has just
allowed certain relaxation of the faculty
imposed restrictions, claiming these are
irrelevant because ROTC is scheduled to leave
in a couple of years. What the real plans are
history will tell.
Recent years have also brought to light a
great deal of Administrative foot-dragging on
compliance with Stanford's public policy of
doing away with classified research on campus.
Consider in this light, Professor Noyes
revelation that there were CIA contracts at
Stanford hidden so well that only the faculty
members who had the contract and one other
administrator knew of its existence. Questions
about these and other possible CIA
connections have met with stony silence.
Stanford Sit-ins
Or, consider the information which flowed
from the sit-in at the 1969 Applied Electronics
Laboratory showing that the members of the
research committee were rewriting titles and
public descriptions of classified contracts
making it impossible to know if the project fit
within campus guidelines. A tightening of
restrictions on classified research ensued, but
various episodes since then have raised doubts
as to how well that policy is being adhered to.
The sit-in at the Computer Center this
spring was in response to disclosures that
despite campus regulations SRI was running
