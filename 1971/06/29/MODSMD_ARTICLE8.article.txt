# Pentagon Papers: Healthy Skepticism

The exposures of the Pentagon Papers
probably contain few surprises for the
majority of people in a community like
Stanford where the abundance of antiwar
literature, films, lectures, and teach-ins over
the past several years have already drawn the
outlines of the story in clear, well documented
strokes. Nonetheless, the exposure of the
whole picture, with primary documentation
showing the pervasive its-for-their-own-good
not-to-know attitude toward the public
knowledge of government policy brings a
certain sense of shock. It also raises a current
problem, which, if left unsolved, could spell
the end of government by the people in this
country: The problem, of course, is the extent
to which executive power can secure itself by
secrecy against the traditional checks and
balances which make it responsive to the will
of the governed.
Daniel Ellsberg, the Pentagon official who
turned his back on 13 years of loyalty to the
â€¢security and secrecy system to make these
'documents public, explained in an interview
with C.B.S.'s Walter Cronkite, that it was not
only his revulsion of the Vietnam war which
influenced his decision to put the truth on
display, but the recognition that the executive
branch had extended its power far beyond
constitutionally allowable confines by the use
of secrecy to prevent even Congress from
knowing what was/is actually going on. As
Ellsberg explained, he decided to release the
papers because he feared a repeat now of the
'presidential year' policy, where publicly we

were de-escalating but privately planning to
escalate as soon as the political timing was
right.
'Healthy Skepticism'
Thanks to Ellsberg and the New York
Times, the American people are probably
developing a healthy skepticism all over the
country as to how far one should trust the
public pronouncements of Washington
bureaucrats. This could lead to a resurgence of
respect of Washington bureaucrats. This could
lead to a resurgence of respect for the Bill of
Rights, individual privacy and a cut-back of
governmental functioning in the area of
so-called "National Security." Right on!
But perhaps the inquisition into the
usurping of prerogatives traditionally allowed
to other constituencies by overractive
administrative bodies should not stop at
Washington. The Stanford Administration, for
example, has its own version of classified
information which extends far beyond the
traditional privacy accorded to salaries and
personnel information.
One has only to look at the history of the
decisions concerning the status of ROTC on
campus, in which the faculty was responsible
for decisions concerning academic credit for
ROTC. The Administration did not see fit to
bring to faculty attention, among other
relevant items, the new credit arrangements
being made by ROTC at other major schools.
Fortunately, courageous faculty members and
students ferreted out some of the truth before

the final decisions on whether to cut ROTC
loose were made. The story is far from over
yet, however, as the Administration has just
allowed certain relaxation of the faculty
imposed restrictions, claiming these are
irrelevant because ROTC is scheduled to leave
in a couple of years. What the real plans are
history will tell.
Recent years have also brought to light a
great deal of Administrative foot-dragging on
compliance with Stanford's public policy of
doing away with classified research on campus.
Consider in this light, Professor Noyes
revelation that there were CIA contracts at
Stanford hidden so well that only the faculty
members who had the contract and one other
administrator knew of its existence. Questions
about these and other possible CIA
connections have met with stony silence.
Stanford Sit-ins
Or, consider the information which flowed
from the sit-in at the 1969 Applied Electronics
Laboratory showing that the members of the
research committee were rewriting titles and
public descriptions of classified contracts
making it impossible to know if the project fit
within campus guidelines. A tightening of
restrictions on classified research ensued, but
various episodes since then have raised doubts
as to how well that policy is being adhered to.
The sit-in at the Computer Center this
spring was in response to disclosures that
despite campus regulations SRI was running
programs for a classified amphibious assault
project on the Stanford Computer. The
Administration claims that it began
proceedings to stop the computer misuse in
advance of the sit-in, but for some obscure
reason, the usual executive secrecy prevented
them from disclosing this until after the
student occupation of the building.
Currently there are a number of contracts
running which are classified "only because we
need to know the launch date of a rocket." I
can't help but ask how much truth there is in
that statement.
The cataloguing and questioning could go
on endlessly, but becomes rendered out as the
picture becomes clear. The reader is referred to
back issues of the Daily and Chaparral and
numerous "movement" publications such as
Fire and Sandstone or the Grass Roots booklet
on Land Development for more detailed
variations on the theme. Perhaps of relevance
here and worthy of note, however, are several
examples of administrative secrecy concerned
specifically with campus governance matters.
For example, I think I counted up to eight
administrators who claimed the dubious credit
of having made the decision to call the police
in to break up the hospital sit-in even though
several of these people were rumored to have
been in favor of settling the dispute by
reaching agreement with the demonstrators. Is
there any reason why honest debates of policy
such as this should not be aired publicly? Or is
there something to hide?

Another set of questions surround the
resignation of President Pitzer. Speculations
and rumors are rampant, but those who know
what actually went on behind the scenes aren't
telling.
I have been told by a highly placed
University official that more than two years
ago the Administration went to the Advisory
Board and asked to start proceedings to fire
Professor Franklin. They were told at the time
that their case was inadequate, but this was
not made public at the time to anyone's
recollection.
Faculty members report that on going to
Mr. Schwartz' office to hear what was
recorded at the Lodge demonstration, they
were treated to one of the two or more tapes
made in the auditorium, that one being the
one made with the microphone facing the
audience so that they never knew of the
existence of the podium tape with all the
relevant comments of Mr. Lodge and Mr.
Campbell until its existence came to light in
connection with the injunction hearing.
Last, the firing of the five hospital workers
who allegedly took part in the sit-in provides
an example of administrative secrecy directly
harmful to the supervisors and co-workers of
these employees. The supervisors were not
advised of the dismissals until after the
dismissing letters were already in the mail. This
allowed the supervisors 27 hours to make
arrangements to cover the work ordinarily
done by a full-time person.
In this case, the bureaucratic secrecy

extended down as far as the department
chairmen, who Provost Miller says were
advised and consulted but who never let out a
word of what was up until it came down.
What makes the Stanford's secrecy game
run is difficult to discern. Why faculty
members, students and administrators
voluntarily abide by unwritten rules of
propriety in the disclosure of material
important to community decision making even
when they themselves disagree with the course
of action being followed and feel the decision
would be better made out in the open is a
puzzle whose solution is not as simple as the
oft-stated "They're all pigs." Perhaps it's
loyalty, or fear, or perhaps its just the
pervading view in the country as a whole that
that is the way a real administration of
anything bigger than a family grocery does
business.
In any event, it is clear that just as Congress
cannot operate adequately in areas where it
should when administrative secrecy shrouds
plans and intentions of the executive, so the
Stanford faculty, students or workers cannot
make policy in areas legitimately their
prerogative, if they are prevented from getting
the facts about what they are deciding. Such a
situation leads to an over extended executive
which, in the end, becomes all powerful, and
we all know what name to apply to that.
Viva the Ellsbergs of the world!
