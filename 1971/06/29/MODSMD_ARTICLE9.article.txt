## Absolute Freedom of Press 
### bill evers 
On June 15, citing a threat to
its interests, the government of
the United States hit the New
York Times with an injunction
designed to halt publication of the
1968 Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The government has
since then stopped other
newspapers from publishing
material drawn from the Pentagon
study.
Yet upon reading the First
Amendment one finds that
Congress is to make no law
abridging the freedom of the
press, and in reading the

Constitution further, that the
Fourteenth Amendment extends
this prohibition to all other levels
of government.
In an essay written in 1799,
George Hay, a Jeffersonian
democrat, contended that "if the
words freedom of the press have
any meaning at all, they mean a
total exemption from any law
making any publication whatever
criminal." The only other
alternative is to construe the First
Amendment as meaning that
Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of the

press, which freedom is restrained
by law insofar as the public good
requires. "Folly itself does not
speak such language," said Hay.
Prior Restraint
There has been much written
of late to the effect that freedom
of the press means no prior
restraint upon publication. It is
true that the doctrine of no prior
restraint has a long history in
common law and in judicial
interpretation. Nonetheless, it is
an irrational doctrine and one
destructive of human liberty. The
doctrine of no prior restraint
should be jettisoned without
further ado.
To understand why, imagine
that the prohibition written into
the Constitution that says
Congress shall make no law
prohibiting the free exercise of
religion were interpreted as
meaning no prior restraint on the
expression of religious beliefs, but
that statutes provided subsequent
punishment for having expressed
certain religious or irreligious
beliefs. Thus, freedom of religion
was restrained through the threat
of jail.
In the parallel case of the press,
the words of James Madison in a
1799 report to the Virginia
legislature are directly to the

point: "It would seem a mockery
to say that no laws should be
passed preventing publications
from being made, but that laws
might be passed for punishing
them in case they should be
made."
Ban Libel Laws
Questions of truth or falsity, of
malice, and of the bad tendency
of remarks, questions that in the
past have figured prominently in
discussions of libel, do not belong
in a rational legal code. Questions
of truth or falsity are relevant to
the protection of people's rights
in cases of swindling, but are not
relevant to the publication of
opinion and sentiment. The
bad-tendency test of words must
be rejected and repudiated. It
condemns words on the ground
that their influence might possibly
at some future time cause some
imaginary harm.
All defamation and libel laws
should be repealed. These laws
attempt to freeze one's subjective
evaluations of other persons and
to close off from one's
consideration alternative opinions
and sentiments concerning those
persons. No one has a right to
force people to adhere to their
previous opinions of him or a
right to demand that conditions
be maintained which will ensure
the preservation of such previous
opinions.
The proper test of criminality
is proof of overt, invasive acts.
Libel is not criminal by this test.

Stolen Property?
The executive branch of the
U.S. government seemed to be
making several arguments in
addition to the one of national
interest, in asking its judicial
branch for the injunctions against
the press. Among these, one is
that the Pentagon study is
government property, which has
been taken without the
authorization of its owners.
Victor Lasky asks in his column
printed in the June 27 San
Francisco Examiner & Chronicle:
"Do such newspapers as the New
York Times and the Washington
Post, high and mighty as they
believe themselves to be, have the
right to traffic in stolen goods?"
Another argument, recognized by
James Reston in his column in the
June 16 issue of the Times, is "the
Government's desire to preserve
the privacy of its internal
communications."
There is, however, a false ring
to any such arguments by
government officials. If we
demythologize government the
way theologians have recently

been demythologizing religion, we
can see how often the government
itself subsists off of stolen
property. For example, the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities seized films made by
television stations to make the
movie "Operation Abolition."
Taxation itself, baldly considered,
is confiscation of property.
To speak of this government's
desire for privacy in its internal
communications is to capture the
full irony of the situation. These
days, when citizens act together in
private for common purposes, it is
prosecuted as conspiracy by the
government. Attorney General
Mitchel has arrogated to the
executive branch broad,
discretionary powers to tap
telephone conversations.
Besides, with the United States
actively pursuing a foreign policy
of military intervention around
the globe, it would indeed by
inappropriate to speak of securing
the full rights of the U.S.
government. High officials of the
United States may well be guilty,
as jurist Richard Wasserstrom has
recently pointed out, of war
crimes, crimes against peace, and
crimes against humanity. The
Pentagon study is evidence in a
case being tried under a higher law
than the U.S. Code.
Gang of Criminals
Let us say we come upon a

gang of criminals who maintain
themselves by robbery, violence,
and threat of violence. The
members of this gang relinquish
their rights insofar as they violate
the rights of others. If they can be
apprehended, the members of this
gang should be forced to
compensate their victims and
should receive penalties befitting
their crimes.
Let us now suppose that a
member of this gang, who
previously believed that the acts
of the gang were good, comes to
recognize them for what they are.
To aid justice, this member brings
with him evidence of the gang's
crimes when he leaves the gang.
He then advertises far and wide
the gang's crimes in order to
enlighten thy public.
While Daniel Ellsberg has not
and would not discuss the U.S.
government in quite such
irreverent terms, he does believe
that American officials "bear
major responsibility .. . for every
death in combat in Indochina in
the last 25 years, and that's
one-million to two-million
people." As evidence, Ellsberg
cites the Pentagon study, calling it
"the U.S. equivalent of the
Nuremberg war-crimes
documents."
* * *
There is a further problem
which the Times, the Post, and

other newspapers (including the
Stanford Daily, whose offices
were searched by the police on
April 12) face in the legal battles
over the freedom of the press
which lie ahead. This is the fact
that in an important sense the
government is judge in its own
case, for the judiciary is
undeniably part of the
governmental apparatus and often
dependent upon the legislative
and executive branches for
appointment and promotion. The
suggestion of the late Bruno Leoni
in his work Freedom and the Law
that the ancient practice of the
separation of government from
the judicial function be restored is
entirely a propos under the
circumstances.

Ban Libel Laws
Questions of truth or falsity, of
malice, and of the bad tendency
of remarks, questions that in the
past have figured prominently in
discussions of libel, do not belong
in a rational legal code. Questions
of truth or falsity are relevant to
the protection of people's rights
in cases of swindling, but are not
relevant to the publication of
opinion and sentiment. The
bad-tendency test of words must
be rejected and repudiated. It
condemns words on the ground
that their influence might possibly
at some future time cause some
imaginary harm.
All defamation and libel laws
should be repealed. These laws
attempt to freeze one's subjective
evaluations of other persons and
to close off from one's
consideration alternative opinions
and sentiments concerning those
persons. No one has a right to
force people to adhere to their
previous opinions of him or a
right to demand that conditions
be maintained which will ensure
the preservation of such previous
opinions.
The proper test of criminality
is proof of overt, invasive acts.

Stolen Property?
The executive branch of the
U.S. government seemed to be
making several arguments in
addition to the one of national
interest, in asking its judicial
branch for the injunctions against
the press. Among these, one is
that the Pentagon study is
government property, which has
been taken without the
authorization of its owners.
Victor Lasky asks in his column
printed in the June 27 San
Francisco Examiner & Chronicle:
"Do such newspapers as the New
York Times and the Washington
Post, high and mighty as they
believe themselves to be, have the
right to traffic in stolen goods?"
Another argument, recognized by
James Reston in his column in the
June 16 issue of the Times, is "the
Government's desire to preserve
the privacy of its internal
communications."
There is, however, a false ring
to any such arguments by
government officials. If we
demythologize government the
way theologians have recently

been demythologizing religion, we
can see how often the government
itself subsists off of stolen
property. For example, the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities seized films made by
television stations to make the
movie "Operation Abolition."
Taxation itself, baldly considered,
is confiscation of property.
To speak of this government's
desire for privacy in its internal
communications is to capture the
full irony of the situation. These
days, when citizens act together in
private for common purposes, it is
prosecuted as conspiracy by the
government. Attorney General
Mitchel has arrogated to the
executive branch broad,
discretionary powers to tap
telephone conversations.
Besides, with the United States
actively pursuing a foreign policy
of military intervention around
the globe, it would indeed by
inappropriate to speak of securing
the full rights of the U.S.
government. High officials of the
United States may well be guilty,
as jurist Richard Wasserstrom has
recently pointed out, of war
crimes, crimes against peace, and
crimes against humanity. The
Pentagon study is evidence in a
case being tried under a higher law
than the U.S. Code.
Gang of Criminals
Let us say we come upon a

gang of criminals who maintain
themselves by robbery, violence,
and threat of violence. The
members of this gang relinquish
their rights insofar as they violate
the rights of others. If they can be
apprehended, the members of this
gang should be forced to
compensate their victims and
should receive penalties befitting
their crimes.
Let us now suppose that a
member of this gang, who
previously believed that the acts
of the gang were good, comes to
recognize them for what they are.
To aid justice, this member brings
with him evidence of the gang's
crimes when he leaves the gang.
He then advertises far and wide
the gang's crimes in order to
enlighten thy public.
While Daniel Ellsberg has not
and would not discuss the U.S.
government in quite such
irreverent terms, he does believe
that American officials "bear
major responsibility .. . for every
death in combat in Indochina in
the last 25 years, and that's
one-million to two-million
people." As evidence, Ellsberg
cites the Pentagon study, calling it
"the U.S. equivalent of the
Nuremberg war-crimes
documents."
* * *
There is a further problem
which the Times, the Post, and

other newspapers (including the
Stanford Daily, whose offices
were searched by the police on
April 12) face in the legal battles
over the freedom of the press
which lie ahead. This is the fact
that in an important sense the
government is judge in its own
case, for the judiciary is
undeniably part of the
governmental apparatus and often
dependent upon the legislative
and executive branches for
appointment and promotion. The
suggestion of the late Bruno Leoni
in his work Freedom and the Law
that the ancient practice of the
separation of government from
the judicial function be restored is
entirely a propos under the
circumstances.

columnist for the Daily J
On June 15, citing a threat to
its interests, the government of
the United States hit the New
York Times with an injunction
designed to halt publication of the
1968 Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The government has
since then stopped other
newspapers from publishing
material drawn from the Pentagon
study.
Yet upon reading the First
Amendment one finds that
Congress is to make no law
abridging the freedom of the
press, and in reading the

Constitution further, that the
Fourteenth Amendment extends
this prohibition to all other levels
of government.
In an essay written in 1799,
George Hay, a Jeffersonian
democrat, contended that "if the
words freedom of the press have
any meaning at all, they mean a
total exemption from any law
making any publication whatever
criminal." The only other
alternative is to construe the First
Amendment as meaning that
Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of the

press, which freedom is restrained
by law insofar as the public good
requires. "Folly itself does not
speak such language," said Hay.
Prior Restraint
There has been much written
of late to the effect that freedom
of the press means no prior
restraint upon publication. It is
true that the doctrine of no prior
restraint has a long history in
common law and in judicial
interpretation. Nonetheless, it is
an irrational doctrine and one
destructive of human liberty. The
doctrine of no prior restraint
should be jettisoned without
further ado.
To understand why, imagine
that the prohibition written into
the Constitution that says
Congress shall make no law
prohibiting the free exercise of
religion were interpreted as
meaning no prior restraint on the
expression of religious beliefs, but
that statutes provided subsequent
punishment for having expressed
certain religious or irreligious
beliefs. Thus, freedom of religion
was restrained through the threat
of jail.
In the parallel case of the press,
the words of James Madison in a
1799 report to the Virginia
legislature are directly to the

point: "It would seem a mockery
to say that no laws should be
passed preventing publications
from being made, but that laws
might be passed for punishing
them in case they should be
made."

way theologians have recently

been demythologizing religion, we
can see how often the government
itself subsists off of stolen
property. For example, the House
Committee on Un-American
Activities seized films made by
television stations to make the
movie "Operation Abolition."
Taxation itself, baldly considered,
is confiscation of property.
To speak of this government's
desire for privacy in its internal
communications is to capture the
full irony of the situation. These
days, when citizens act together in
private for common purposes, it is
prosecuted as conspiracy by the
government. Attorney General
Mitchel has arrogated to the
executive branch broad,
discretionary powers to tap
telephone conversations.
Besides, with the United States
actively pursuing a foreign policy
of military intervention around
the globe, it would indeed by
inappropriate to speak of securing
the full rights of the U.S.
government. High officials of the
United States may well be guilty,
as jurist Richard Wasserstrom has
recently pointed out, of war
crimes, crimes against peace, and
crimes against humanity. The
Pentagon study is evidence in a
case being tried under a higher law
than the U.S. Code.
Gang of Criminals
Let us say we come upon a

gang of criminals who maintain
themselves by robbery, violence,
and threat of violence. The
members of this gang relinquish
their rights insofar as they violate
the rights of others. If they can be
apprehended, the members of this
gang should be forced to
compensate their victims and
should receive penalties befitting
their crimes.
Let us now suppose that a
member of this gang, who
previously believed that the acts
of the gang were good, comes to
recognize them for what they are.
To aid justice, this member brings
with him evidence of the gang's
crimes when he leaves the gang.
He then advertises far and wide
the gang's crimes in order to
enlighten thy public.
While Daniel Ellsberg has not
and would not discuss the U.S.
government in quite such
irreverent terms, he does believe
that American officials "bear
major responsibility .. . for every
death in combat in Indochina in
the last 25 years, and that's
one-million to two-million
people." As evidence, Ellsberg
cites the Pentagon study, calling it
"the U.S. equivalent of the
Nuremberg war-crimes
documents."

There is a further problem
which the Times, the Post, and

other newspapers (including the
Stanford Daily, whose offices
were searched by the police on
April 12) face in the legal battles
over the freedom of the press
which lie ahead. This is the fact
that in an important sense the
government is judge in its own
case, for the judiciary is
undeniably part of the
governmental apparatus and often
dependent upon the legislative
and executive branches for
appointment and promotion. The
suggestion of the late Bruno Leoni
in his work Freedom and the Law
that the ancient practice of the
separation of government from
the judicial function be restored is
entirely a propos under the
circumstances.

On June 15, citing a threat to
its interests, the government of
the United States hit the New
York Times with an injunction
designed to halt publication of the
1968 Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The government has
since then stopped other
newspapers from publishing
material drawn from the Pentagon
study.
Yet upon reading the First
Amendment one finds that
Congress is to make no law
abridging the freedom of the
press, and in reading the

Constitution further, that the
Fourteenth Amendment extends
this prohibition to all other levels
of government.
In an essay written in 1799,
George Hay, a Jeffersonian
democrat, contended that "if the
words freedom of the press have
any meaning at all, they mean a
total exemption from any law
making any publication whatever
criminal." The only other
alternative is to construe the First
Amendment as meaning that
Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of the

press, which freedom is restrained
by law insofar as the public good
requires. "Folly itself does not
speak such language," said Hay.
Prior Restraint
There has been much written
of late to the effect that freedom
of the press means no prior
restraint upon publication. It is
true that the doctrine of no prior
restraint has a long history in
common law and in judicial
interpretation. Nonetheless, it is
an irrational doctrine and one
destructive of human liberty. The
doctrine of no prior restraint
should be jettisoned without
further ado.
To understand why, imagine
that the prohibition written into
the Constitution that says
Congress shall make no law
prohibiting the free exercise of
religion were interpreted as
meaning no prior restraint on the
expression of religious beliefs, but
that statutes provided subsequent
punishment for having expressed
certain religious or irreligious
beliefs. Thus, freedom of religion
was restrained through the threat
of jail.
In the parallel case of the press,
the words of James Madison in a
1799 report to the Virginia
legislature are directly to the

point: "It would seem a mockery
to say that no laws should be
passed preventing publications
from being made, but that laws
might be passed for punishing
them in case they should be
made."
Ban Libel Laws
Questions of truth or falsity, of
malice, and of the bad tendency
of remarks, questions that in the
past have figured prominently in
discussions of libel, do not belong
in a rational legal code. Questions
of truth or falsity are relevant to
the protection of people's rights
in cases of swindling, but are not
relevant to the publication of
opinion and sentiment. The
bad-tendency test of words must
be rejected and repudiated. It
condemns words on the ground
that their influence might possibly
at some future time cause some
imaginary harm.
All defamation and libel laws
should be repealed. These laws
attempt to freeze one's subjective
evaluations of other persons and
to close off from one's
consideration alternative opinions
and sentiments concerning those
persons. No one has a right to
force people to adhere to their
previous opinions of him or a
right to demand that conditions
be maintained which will ensure
the preservation of such previous
opinions.
The proper test of criminality
is proof of overt, invasive acts.
Libel is not criminal by this test.

Stolen Property?
The executive branch of the
U.S. government seemed to be
making several arguments in
addition to the one of national
interest, in asking its judicial
branch for the injunctions against
the press. Among these, one is
that the Pentagon study is
government property, which has
been taken without the
authorization of its owners.
Victor Lasky asks in his column
printed in the June 27 San
Francisco Examiner & Chronicle:
"Do such newspapers as the New
York Times and the Washington
Post, high and mighty as they
believe themselves to be, have the
right to traffic in stolen goods?"
Another argument, recognized by
James Reston in his column in the
June 16 issue of the Times, is "the
Government's desire to preserve
the privacy of its internal
communications."
There is, however, a false ring
to any such arguments by
government officials. If we

been demythologizing religion, we
