## Absolute Freedom of Press 
### bill evers 
On June 15, citing a threat to
its interests, the government of
the United States hit the New
York Times with an injunction
designed to halt publication of the
1968 Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The government has
since then stopped other
newspapers from publishing
material drawn from the Pentagon
study.
Yet upon reading the First
Amendment one finds that
Congress is to make no law
abridging the freedom of the
press, and in reading the

Constitution further, that the
Fourteenth Amendment extends
this prohibition to all other levels
of government.
In an essay written in 1799,
George Hay, a Jeffersonian
democrat, contended that "if the
words freedom of the press have
any meaning at all, they mean a
total exemption from any law
making any publication whatever
criminal." The only other
alternative is to construe the First
Amendment as meaning that
Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of the

press, which freedom is restrained
by law insofar as the public good
requires. "Folly itself does not
speak such language," said Hay.
Prior Restraint
There has been much written
of late to the effect that freedom
of the press means no prior
restraint upon publication. It is
true that the doctrine of no prior
restraint has a long history in
common law and in judicial
interpretation. Nonetheless, it is
an irrational doctrine and one
destructive of human liberty. The
doctrine of no prior restraint
should be jettisoned without
further ado.
To understand why, imagine
that the prohibition written into
the Constitution that says
Congress shall make no law
prohibiting the free exercise of
religion were interpreted as
meaning no prior restraint on the
expression of religious beliefs, but
that statutes provided subsequent
punishment for having expressed
certain religious or irreligious
beliefs. Thus, freedom of religion
was restrained through the threat
of jail.
In the parallel case of the press,
the words of James Madison in a
1799 report to the Virginia
legislature are directly to the

point: "It would seem a mockery
to say that no laws should be
passed preventing publications
from being made, but that laws
might be passed for punishing
them in case they should be
made."
Ban Libel Laws
Questions of truth or falsity, of
malice, and of the bad tendency
of remarks, questions that in the
past have figured prominently in
discussions of libel, do not belong
in a rational legal code. Questions
of truth or falsity are relevant to
the protection of people's rights
in cases of swindling, but are not
relevant to the publication of
opinion and sentiment. The
bad-tendency test of words must
be rejected and repudiated. It
condemns words on the ground
that their influence might possibly
at some future time cause some
imaginary harm.
All defamation and libel laws
should be repealed. These laws
attempt to freeze one's subjective
evaluations of other persons and
to close off from one's
consideration alternative opinions
and sentiments concerning those
persons. No one has a right to
force people to adhere to their
previous opinions of him or a
right to demand that conditions
