This Week In The i Daily'
Today is July 2, 1971. On this day in 1937 Amelia Earhart
Ihitnam, world famous aviatrix, is reputed to have crashed her
plane in the West Pacific in an attempt to circle the globe
alone. We have been informed that her real purpose was the
delivery to Peking of classified documents revealing the true
nature of American policy decisions leading to U.S.
intervention in the "Boxer Rebellion" in 1900.
