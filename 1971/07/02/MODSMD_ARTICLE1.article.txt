# 'Red Squad' Suit
## Police Set New Photo Rules 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Rules on photographing dem
onstrators and keeping files on
them announced this week by
the Palo Alto Police Department
are part of an effort to control a
"department that went wild for
awhile," lawyer Jim Wolpman
said Wednesday.
Wolpman was a lawyer for
plaintiffs in the "Red Squad"
suit. The suit charged a group of
Palo Alto police officers had
harrassed activists in 1970 by
taking intimidating pictures and
keeping files on peaceful protest
ors. The suit was dropped after
ers. new rules were announced
Monday.
Police Chief James Zurcher
repeated his assertion the new
"general orders" are "just the
formalization of our regular
policy," long-followed by the
department.
The new rules allow police to
photograph only illegal acts or
demonstrations where the of
ficer judges lawbreaking is likely
to occur. Files of "relevant
material" may be kept only on
those actually arrested or being
actively investigated for prosecu
tion—except when the Chief
himself agrees someone is sus
pected of conspiracy to commit
a future crime.
Wolpman said the new rules
convinced his clients to drop the
case against the alleged "Red
Squad" unit because, "We got a
better deal than we could get in
court with the way the courts
are going now."
Question of Merit
City Attorney Peter Stone
denied the new rules were
negotiated to settle the lawsuit
by eight local activists and
liberals. He said the plaintiffs
dropped the suit only because
"their complaint had no merit
legally or factually."
Wolpman insisted "there sim
ply wasn't any (police) policy
before and everybody went and
did their thing." He charged

overzealous officers were free to
intimidate activists because for
mer Police Chief William Hydie
"couldn't run a big city depart
ment."
Wolpman said the "Red
Squad," which police deny ever
existed, was organized by Patrol
men Roger Goodyear and Ray
mond Blasingame.
Narcs at Work
"They started an amalgum of
the narcs, who do the under
cover work and dig anything
that's secret," he said.
Insisting police practice
through 1970 had violated the
limits on surveillance announced
this week, Wolpman's partner
Norton Tooby claimed, "Patrol
man Roger GooHvear swore
under oath that he tried to take
the picture of every demonstra
tor at every demonstration and
tried to identify every demon
strater by name."
Goodyear refused to com
ment on the charge. The Daily
yesterday talked by telephone
with New York lawyer James
Robertson. Robertson confirm
ed he was the stenographer in
Palo Alto in "late June or early
July of 1971," when Goodyear
gave a sworn deposition under
subpoena from plaintiffs in the
"Red Squad" case.
Goodyear's Efforts
Robertson's quotations from
the transcript presented no di
rect evidence of Tooby's claim
Goodyear had photographed
"every demonstration." But
they confirmed Goodyear's ex
tensive efforts to keep track of
local activists.
According to Robertson's
transcript of the testimony,
Goodyear described his assign
ment to "monitor and take
pictures" at a number of peace
ful rallies in Palo Alto between
January and March, 1970.
Goodyear said his orders for a
January 12 protest were "to just
photograph the demonstration

in the event there was a violation
to later prosecute."
The new rules allow photo
graphing only rallies where the
officer's best professional judg
ment "indicates the likelihood
of violence." But asked if he had
any reason to expect violence at
the June 12 demonstration,
Goodyear said, "I had no way of
knowing."
Pictures Retained
Goodyear testified his col
leagues took up to 50 photo
graphs at a peaceful rally Janu
ary 18. He and others then drew
circles around those they recog
nized in the eight-by-ten blow
ups of the crowd scenes. He said
the circled pictures "were retain
ed" to use "in the event a
criminal prosecution is ini
tiated."
Goodyear testified he kept a
personal file of prominent pro
testers, but only those who had
been arrested for crimes.
