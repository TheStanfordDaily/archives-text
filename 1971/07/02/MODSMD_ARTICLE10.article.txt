# ACT Announces Season's Plays
## 
### 
Two Cleopatras, George Ber
nard Shaw's and William Shakes
peare's, will lead off the Ameri
can Conservatory Theater's
forthcoming 1971-72 repertory
season in San Francisco.
The upcoming season will be
two weeks longer than last
season, offering a total of nine
shows instead of the previous
season's eight.
Premiere production of the
1971-72 season will be Shaw's
"Caesar and Cleopatra," under
ACT general director William

Bail's direction, opening Oct. 30.
The famous 1898 Shaw comedy
portrays the legendary Egyptian
queen as a provocative child
woman playing an intricate pow
er game with Rome's emperor,
an aging warrior both vain and
vulnerable.
A totally different view of
the exotic African monarch will
arive at the Geary three days
later when Shakespeare's sweep
ing "Anthony and Cleopatra"
joins the Shaw play in rotating
repertory Nov. 2, directed by

Ellis Rabb.
The Shakespearean master
piece presents Antony, the great
Roman general, as a heroic
figure torn between his con
science as a leader of an empire
and his passion for the barbaric
and beautiful Cleopatra. Aban
doning country and family, he
succumbs to the obsessive love
that changed the course of
ancient history.
The third new production,
Arthur Wing Pinero's "Dandy
Dick," joins the ACT repertory

Dec. 14. Directed by Edward
Hastings, the little-known 1887
British comedy presents a breezy
Victorian culture confrontation
as a super-respectable clergyman
finds his staid, impeccable home
suddenly invaded by his brash,
lusty sportswoman sister and her
disreputable racetrack cronies.
Clifford Odets' "Paradise
Lost" is the season's fourth
show. Allen Fletcher will stage
the first major new production
in many years of the 1935
comedy-drama that offers a

kaleidoscopic vision of urban
America in the grip of the Great
Depression.
Opening Feb. 1, the Odets
work conjures up a vision of the
American middle class exiled
from its "paradise" as one
family struggles to make a life
amid a nation ravaged by econ
omic crisis, changing values and
cries of revolution.
"Dracula," opening Feb. 22
under Ball's direction, is the
prime contender for the most
unusual production of ACT's
new season. Bram Stoker's fam
ed turn-of-the-century tale of
the world's most celebrated
vampire will come to the Geary
stage in a new adaptation replete
with ghastly nocturnal rambles,
mysterious neck wounds and
other mythic terrors.
A sixth new production,
currently in negotiation, will be
announced later.
Rounding out the schedule
will be three revivals of major
successes from past seasons.
George M. Cohan's "The Tav
ern," the surprise hit of ACT's
1970 season, will return to the
repertory Nov. 23. Previously
presented at the Marines' Me
morial Theater, the comedy
melodrama will be restaged at
the larger Geary by Rabb,
original ACT director.
Ball's production of "Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead," by Tom Stoppard, a
major success of both the 1969
and 1970 seasons, will return to
the Geary Jan. 11.
Henrik Ibsen's "An Enemy of
the People," among last season's
most acclaimed shows, will be
revived under Fletcher's direct
ion starting April 4. Like the
other revivals, it will have only a
limited number of performances.

the first major new production
in many years of the 1935
comedy-drama that offers a

kaleidoscopic vision of urban
America in the grip of the Great
Depression.
Opening Feb. 1, the Odets
work conjures up a vision of the
American middle class exiled
from its "paradise" as one
family struggles to make a life
amid a nation ravaged by econ
omic crisis, changing values and
cries of revolution.
"Dracula," opening Feb. 22
under Ball's direction, is the
prime contender for the most
unusual production of ACT's
new season. Bram Stoker's fam
ed turn-of-the-century tale of
the world's most celebrated
vampire will come to the Geary
stage in a new adaptation replete
with ghastly nocturnal rambles,
mysterious neck wounds and
other mythic terrors.
A sixth new production,
currently in negotiation, will be
announced later.
Rounding out the schedule
will be three revivals of major
successes from past seasons.
George M. Cohan's "The Tav
ern," the surprise hit of ACT's
1970 season, will return to the
repertory Nov. 23. Previously
presented at the Marines' Me
morial Theater, the comedy
melodrama will be restaged at
the larger Geary by Rabb,
original ACT director.
Ball's production of "Rosen
crantz and Guildenstern Are
Dead," by Tom Stoppard, a
major success of both the 1969
and 1970 seasons, will return to
the Geary Jan. 11.
Henrik Ibsen's "An Enemy of
the People," among last season's
most acclaimed shows, will be
revived under Fletcher's direct
ion starting April 4. Like the
other revivals, it will have only a
limited number of performances.
Two Cleopatras, George Ber
nard Shaw's and William Shakes
peare's, will lead off the Ameri
can Conservatory Theater's
forthcoming 1971-72 repertory
season in San Francisco.
The upcoming season will be
two weeks longer than last
season, offering a total of nine
shows instead of the previous
season's eight.
Premiere production of the
1971-72 season will be Shaw's
"Caesar and Cleopatra," under
ACT general director William

Bail's direction, opening Oct. 30.
The famous 1898 Shaw comedy
portrays the legendary Egyptian
queen as a provocative child
woman playing an intricate pow
er game with Rome's emperor,
an aging warrior both vain and
vulnerable.
A totally different view of
the exotic African monarch will
arive at the Geary three days
later when Shakespeare's sweep
ing "Anthony and Cleopatra"
joins the Shaw play in rotating
repertory Nov. 2, directed by

Ellis Rabb.
The Shakespearean master
piece presents Antony, the great
Roman general, as a heroic
figure torn between his con
science as a leader of an empire
and his passion for the barbaric
and beautiful Cleopatra. Aban
doning country and family, he
succumbs to the obsessive love
that changed the course of
ancient history.
The third new production,
Arthur Wing Pinero's "Dandy
Dick," joins the ACT repertory

Dec. 14. Directed by Edward
Hastings, the little-known 1887
British comedy presents a breezy
Victorian culture confrontation
as a super-respectable clergyman
finds his staid, impeccable home
suddenly invaded by his brash,
lusty sportswoman sister and her
disreputable racetrack cronies.
Clifford Odets' "Paradise
Lost" is the season's fourth
show. Allen Fletcher will stage
the first major new production
in many years of the 1935
comedy-drama that offers a

kaleidoscopic vision of urban
America in the grip of the Great
Depression.
