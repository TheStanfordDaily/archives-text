# PATU Plans Price Coup
## 
### DAVID ELKIND 
A new conspiracy has raised
its sights at over-inflated food
prices and"the alienated form
of life" of the average food
buyer.
Modeled after the nearly 20
other flourishing food co-opera
tives in the Bay Area, the Palo
Alto Tenants' Union Food Con
spiracy has been selling about
$200 worth of groceries each
week at near wholesale prices,
and it has brought members of
the community into almost all
phases of the food business.
Once a week co-operative
members volunteer to pick up
large crates of food at the San
Jose Farmers' from an entrepre
neur who specializes in purchas
ing his supply at the San
Francisco Farmers' Market and
reselling it to communes and
other conspiracies at wholesale
prices.

"Conspirators" who drop off
order forms by Thursday show
up at the PATU Park Saturday
afternoon to pick up their
groceries at prices only five
percent more than wholesale.
At the Town and Country
Market at the Town and Coun
try Village Shopping Center,
onions go for 39 cents per two
pounds, carrots at about 24
cents per pound and string beans
at 49 cents a pound.
The PATU Co-op charges
only four cents for a pound of
onions, and 10 cents and 25
cents for a pound of carrots and
string beans. Prices for all
vegetables, fruits, breads, eggs
and tortillas on the Conspiracy
shopping list include comparable
savings.
Closely tied in with the Food
Conspiracy is the PATU Cheese
Co-op, which purchases its ex
tensive list of domestic and

foreign cheeses from the same
wholesaler as the Town and
Country Cheese Shop but sells
its cheese at much lower prices.
Members of the two Con
spiracies volunteer on a week
to-week basis for jobs ranging
from buying the food at Flea
Markets and cutting cheese to
keeping track of finances and
orders.
They have also been asked to
volunteer for more sustained
work, such as buying and nutri
tion research, but failure to find
volunteers for these longer jobs
has forced the food conspiracy
to name a coordinator, June
graduate Brooke Kantor.
"I really hate to use that
word 'coordinator' because
everyone should be a co-ordina
tor," Kantor said. "It is a
position that evolved only be
cause people weren't doing a
proper share of the work."
Kantor said the PATU Con
spiracy "should avoid permanent
bureaucracy" and remain decen
tralized like those of Berkeley
(involving 5,000 households)

and Sacramento (doing $20,000
worth of business per month).
"Food conspiracies are the
start of building communities
again," he said. "Communities
have died out in America.
"The idea of the conspiracy is
discovering that you have one
thing in common with other
peoples' lives."
