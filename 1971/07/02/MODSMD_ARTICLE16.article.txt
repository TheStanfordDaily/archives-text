## 
### 
A short, handwritten note
received by the Palo Alto Times
yesterday claims credit for the
Wednesday bombing of the Palo
Alto offices of the Transamerica
Title Insurance Co.
Signed "Willy and the Poor
Boys," the note states that the
bombing "is in solidarity with
the workers struggle at Stanford
University.
No University or Palo Alto
Police Department officials con
tacted yesterday had ever heard
of "Willy and the Poor Boys."
A police spokesman said the
department has a description of
a male seen leaving the area
shortly after the 12:10 a.m.
blast, which broke several win
dows in two buildings. But the
department has not released the
man's description pending ef
forts to identify him.
The note, printed in capita!
letters with a felt-tip pen, linked
Transamerica Corporation, a
giant holding company and par
ent firm of the title insurance
company, with the Bank of
America.
However, officials of both
companies were quick to point
out that there have been no
connections between Transamer
ica Corporation and the Bank of
America since 1951.
Police Chief James Zurcher
said last night that some "signifi
cant information" had been
obtained and that an investiga
tion was continuing. He would
not elaborate.
