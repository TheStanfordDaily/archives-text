# Decision Overruled In Grievance Case
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A recommendation by John
Dolly's grievance committee that
he be rehired and the grievance
be suspended until after his case
is heard in court was denied by
Provost William Miller yesterday.
The decision, which Miller
would neither confirm nor deny,
was related to the Daily by
Dolly and later confirmed by
one member of the grievance
committee who refused to be
identified.
Dolly was dismissed early last
week along with four other
employees for his alleged partici
pation in the April 9 hospital
sit-in. Yesterday, after he had
been informed of the decision,

Dolly at first said he would drop
the grievance procedure, but
later agreed to continue despite
the ruling.
In a statement released late
yesterday the committee report
ed, "After a meeting between
the Committee and the Provost,
William F. Miller, for the pur
pose of clarifying certain ques
tions, the Committee and Mr.
Dolly have decided to proceed
with a hearing on the grievance."
According to one member of
the committee, "The question of
suspending the grievance is moot
at this stage."
According to Dolly the se
quence of events leading to the
ft-ovost's ruling was as follows:
The grievance committee first
met v/ith him Tuesday afternoon
where he explained his objec
tions to continuing the hearing
while he faced criminal charges.
They met Wednesday with Pro
vost Miller and his advisors,
Robert Rosenzweig, John
Schwartz, and Bob Nelson. At
this meeting, the committee
unanimously recommended that
the grievance hearings be sus
pended until after the court
case, and that meanwhile Dolly
be rehired.
This recommendation was re

jected, according to Dolly, be
cause the administration felt it
would amount to an open-ended
decision to rehire him. They also
presented the following argu
ments: that it was an urgent
matter for which they had a
responsibility to the community,
that it was not a case of double
jeopardy, that a private hearing
would not harm his court case,
and finally that to postpone
grievance hearings for cases in
volving criminal suits would in
effect reward severe breeches of
policy.
When contacted. Miller said,
"We did talk to them (the
committee) about some proce
dural considerations and they
are considering them now. I'm
not free to say anything while
they are'still meeting."
Committee Chairman Keith
Brodie also refused to confirm
the allegations. He did say that
"we made some recommenda
tions and had some feedback,
and that feedback is being
considered by some others."
This statement by Brodie
apparently referred to Dolly's
consideration of whether to
continue the grievance hearings
after the Provost's ruling.
The reason Dolly gave when
he indicated that he would not
continue was "after talking with
my lawyer we don't think that
they (the grievance committee)
have any power, and although it
might be good to go along, I
don't have the time or inclina
tion."
Later he reported that in
meeting with faculty and staff at
the hospital he was urged to
continue the hearing and had
decided to do so. Apparently
one of the conditions of con
tinuing is that the hearings
remain private.
According to Joseph Scroggs,
assistant personnel director, the
grievance procedure "may be

considered inadequate now by
some. It's really intended to be a
due process type thing, but it
doesn't provide for any outside
determination or authority."
He further states that until
university employees become
unionized the policy cannot
basically be changed. "There
isn't any mechanism to provide
for an arbitration type grievance
procedure because unless there is
a union, there is no one
officially to bargain with."
In a related development
about 30 persons sat in the
corridors of the Personnel Office
in Encina Hall Tuesday protest
ing the five workers' dismissals.
The occupation followed a
rally in front of Provost William

Miller's office and a march
behind the San Francisco Mime
Troupe Band. The rally and
march drew considerably more
participation than the sit-in.
The demonstrators remained
inside Encina throughout the
afternoon, but left peacefully at
5 p.m. when Miller arrived and
declared the building closed. The
remaining protestors, most of
whom were members of Ven
ceremos* then moved to White
Plaza where they held a meeting
and dispersed shortly after six.
The purpose of the occupa
tion according to Doris Youdel
man, one of those inside, was
"to talk to the workers in the
personnel department about the
firings."
