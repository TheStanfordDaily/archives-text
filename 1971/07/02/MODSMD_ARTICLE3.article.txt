# Vacation Crackdown Nabs 20 Bookstore Shoplifters

### CHUCK STEVEN 
Off-duty police hired by the Stanford Book
store caught more than 20 shoplifters during the
transition weeks from spring to summer quarter.
Bookstore Manager Eldon I). Speed said the
bookstore "intermittently rolls in" the plain
clothes policemen at times when the store's
"rip-off problem" reaches epidemic proportions.
Speed said the guards have been hired when
needed since 1967.
The most recent roundup caught thieves
stealing everything from Bic pens to tape recorders
and books worth more than $50. Speed said
experienced plainclothesmen are needed to nab
shoplifters. He described a regular bookstore
worker who tried to stop a shoplifter leaving the
store and "was flattened."
But Speed said the occasional service of the
guards is underplayed. "We avoid any 'Big Brother'
kind of attitude," he said. "Our purpose is not to
intimidate customers, who are, overwhelmingly.

honest."
Speed said the Bookstore has held off on
mirrors, television cameras, armed guards, and
other surveillance methods. He confessed, how
ever, that it may become necessary to publicize
the security system presently in use to avoid a
recurrance of last year's $83,000 inventory
shrinkage, most of which coming as a result of
"liberated" merchandise.
Speed said most heists now are turned over to
Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies. Major
rip-off artists are arrested and booked, but small
attempts usually result in a citation to appear in
court.
Most of the cases lead to suspended sentences,
leading to serious penalties in the case of a second
arrest, according to Speed.
He said Stanford students caught shoplifting
can also be sent to the Stanford Judicial Council
or Dean of Students Office to face campus
penalties.
