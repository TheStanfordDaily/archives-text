## Airlines, Draft, Free Press 
### bill evers 
Several items in the news
recently demonstrate the similar
ities between the political econ
omy of the United States today
and that of the Kingdom of Italy
during the 19305. The corporate
state which Mussolini sought to
establish in Italy was designed to
maintain a rigid a caste structure
in society, a structure which
preserved the old power elite.
This was to be accomplished by
centrally orchestrated bargaining
between organized interest
groups, especially between labor
and management. All such bar
gaining was under the hegemonic
wing of the state itself. The old
ruling caste ensured its control
by manning the levers of power
both in the state and in the
industries.

In my June 22 column, I
discussed the breakdown of the
international airline cartel and
the Civil Aeronautics Board's
efforts to restore the cartel. The
CAB-sustained cartel for airline
service within the state of Texas
has recently broken down also.
Southwest Airlines, modeled on
the cartel-busting Pacific South
west airlines (PSA) of California,
handles only intra-state traffic
and so does not fall under the

CAB power to regulate interstate
commerce.
Braniff International and
Texas International had both
tried for nearly four years to
prevent Southwest from getting
a permit to fly the more
profitable routes within Texas.
Last week, Southwest an
nounced that its coach fare
between Dallas and Houston
would be $20—one-quarter less
than Braniff and Texas Inter
national had been charging.
Braniff and Texas International
both had to lower their prices.

On June 30, the Senate-
House conference committee de
creased the military pay raise
$900 million below what the
House and Senate had approved.
This may have effectively sabo
taged the withering away of
conscription.
Since, however, the House
and the Senate cannot seem to
agree on the Mansfield amend
ment calling for troop with
drawal from Vietnam, there will
be another Senate filibuster on
the draft bill. Several Senators
who did not support Gravel's
and Cranston's earlier filibuster
have said that they will filibuster
if the Mansfield amendment is
not part of the draft bill.

The House had approved a
military pay increase of
$2,711,000,000; the Senate, an
increase of $2,789,000,000 for
the 1971-72 fiscal year. The
conference committee adopted a
figure of $1,803,000,000. Ap
parently the conference commit
tee, which is filled with war
hawks and Pentagon servants,
saw some of their favorite

porkbarrels in the Department
of Defense budget threatened by
money being siphoned off to
end the draft.
The distribution of the pay
raise as suggested by the confer
ence committee is quite differ
ent from that of the Senate bill.
The Senate would have spent the
money on low-ranking enlisted
men and officers—exactly the

elements which need to be
attracted to create an all-volun
teer army. The conference bill
raises pay also in the already
over-paid upper ranks, to which
there is no need to attract
volunteers.
Under the Senate bill the
average recruit would have re
ceived a total of $5320 annually.

The conference bill calls for
$4872. The average recruit's
salary now is about $3000.

The freedom of the press
remains prominent in the news.
The Supreme Court ruled that
the New York Times and the
Washington Post could publish
the Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The grounds of
the ruling were that the Solicitor
General had not shown that
there existed some overwhelm
ing threat to national security.
Despite the beneficial results of
the Supreme Court ruling, the
nebulousness of making decis
ions on the basis of whether or
not there is a threat to national
security should not pass unmen
tioned.
Who determines what the
national security is? The govern
ment does. What is a threat to
national security? Is the truth,
for example, a threat to the
American system? Antonio
Gramsci used to contend that
the truth is always revolution
ary. Is the threat of nuclear war,
in which everyone is equally
threatened, like that of revolu

tion, in which those people who
are the net-beneficiaries of gov
ernment activities are threatened
more? Let us remember that the
"clear and present danger" test
by which the government claims
the right to supress free speech
was enunciated in case which
sent someone to jail for advocat
ing non-compliance with a draft
law.
Let us not think that the New
York Times case secures the
freedom of the press. Senator
Jack Miller (R-Iowa) recently
proposed that a reporter or news
caster be required to pass an
examination of competence by
his peers—with standards set by
the federal government. A simi
lar recommendation was made
by psychiatrist Karl Menninger
in February 1970.
Furthermore, on June 29, the
special Investigations Subcom
mittee of the House Commerce
Committee decided to seek a
contempt of Congress citation
against Frank Stanton, the presi
dent of CBS, for refusing to turn
over to it the unedited film (the
"outtakes") that went into the
controversial documentary "The
Selling of the Pentagon."

Let us not think that the New
York Times case secures the
freedom of the press. Senator
Jack Miller (R-Iowa) recently
proposed that a reporter or news
caster be required to pass an
examination of competence by
his peers—with standards set by
the federal government. A simi
lar recommendation was made
by psychiatrist Karl Menninger
in February 1970.
Furthermore, on June 29, the
special Investigations Subcom
mittee of the House Commerce
Committee decided to seek a
contempt of Congress citation
against Frank Stanton, the presi
dent of CBS, for refusing to turn
over to it the unedited film (the
"outtakes") that went into the
controversial documentary "The
Selling of the Pentagon."
Several items in the news
recently demonstrate the similar
ities between the political econ
omy of the United States today
and that of the Kingdom of Italy
during the 19305. The corporate
state which Mussolini sought to
establish in Italy was designed to
maintain a rigid a caste structure
in society, a structure which
preserved the old power elite.
This was to be accomplished by
centrally orchestrated bargaining
between organized interest
groups, especially between labor
and management. All such bar
gaining was under the hegemonic
wing of the state itself. The old
ruling caste ensured its control
by manning the levers of power
both in the state and in the
industries.

In my June 22 column, I
discussed the breakdown of the
international airline cartel and
the Civil Aeronautics Board's
efforts to restore the cartel. The
CAB-sustained cartel for airline
service within the state of Texas
has recently broken down also.
Southwest Airlines, modeled on
the cartel-busting Pacific South
west airlines (PSA) of California,
handles only intra-state traffic
and so does not fall under the

CAB power to regulate interstate
commerce.
Braniff International and
Texas International had both
tried for nearly four years to
prevent Southwest from getting
a permit to fly the more
profitable routes within Texas.
Last week, Southwest an
nounced that its coach fare
between Dallas and Houston
would be $20—one-quarter less
than Braniff and Texas Inter
national had been charging.
Braniff and Texas International
both had to lower their prices.

On June 30, the Senate-
House conference committee de
creased the military pay raise
$900 million below what the
House and Senate had approved.
This may have effectively sabo
taged the withering away of
conscription.
Since, however, the House
and the Senate cannot seem to
agree on the Mansfield amend
ment calling for troop with
drawal from Vietnam, there will
be another Senate filibuster on
the draft bill. Several Senators
who did not support Gravel's
and Cranston's earlier filibuster
have said that they will filibuster
if the Mansfield amendment is
not part of the draft bill.

The House had approved a
military pay increase of
$2,711,000,000; the Senate, an
increase of $2,789,000,000 for
the 1971-72 fiscal year. The
conference committee adopted a
figure of $1,803,000,000. Ap
parently the conference commit
tee, which is filled with war
hawks and Pentagon servants,
saw some of their favorite

porkbarrels in the Department
of Defense budget threatened by
money being siphoned off to
end the draft.
The distribution of the pay
raise as suggested by the confer
ence committee is quite differ
ent from that of the Senate bill.
The Senate would have spent the
money on low-ranking enlisted
men and officers—exactly the

elements which need to be
attracted to create an all-volun
teer army. The conference bill
raises pay also in the already
over-paid upper ranks, to which
there is no need to attract
volunteers.
Under the Senate bill the
average recruit would have re
ceived a total of $5320 annually.

The conference bill calls for
$4872. The average recruit's
salary now is about $3000.

The freedom of the press
remains prominent in the news.
The Supreme Court ruled that
the New York Times and the
Washington Post could publish
the Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The grounds of
the ruling were that the Solicitor
General had not shown that
there existed some overwhelm
ing threat to national security.
Despite the beneficial results of
the Supreme Court ruling, the
nebulousness of making decis
ions on the basis of whether or
not there is a threat to national
security should not pass unmen
tioned.
Who determines what the
national security is? The govern
ment does. What is a threat to
national security? Is the truth,
for example, a threat to the
American system? Antonio
Gramsci used to contend that
the truth is always revolution
ary. Is the threat of nuclear war,
in which everyone is equally
threatened, like that of revolu

tion, in which those people who
are the net-beneficiaries of gov
ernment activities are threatened
more? Let us remember that the
"clear and present danger" test
by which the government claims
the right to supress free speech

General had not shown that
there existed some overwhelm
ing threat to national security.
Despite the beneficial results of
the Supreme Court ruling, the
nebulousness of making decis
ions on the basis of whether or
not there is a threat to national
security should not pass unmen
tioned.
Who determines what the
national security is? The govern
ment does. What is a threat to
national security? Is the truth,
for example, a threat to the
American system? Antonio
Gramsci used to contend that
the truth is always revolution
ary. Is the threat of nuclear war,
in which everyone is equally
threatened, like that of revolu

tion, in which those people who
are the net-beneficiaries of gov
ernment activities are threatened
more? Let us remember that the
"clear and present danger" test
by which the government claims
the right to supress free speech
was enunciated in case which
sent someone to jail for advocat
ing non-compliance with a draft
law.
Let us not think that the New
York Times case secures the
freedom of the press. Senator
Jack Miller (R-Iowa) recently
proposed that a reporter or news
caster be required to pass an
examination of competence by
his peers—with standards set by
the federal government. A simi
lar recommendation was made
by psychiatrist Karl Menninger
in February 1970.
Furthermore, on June 29, the
special Investigations Subcom
mittee of the House Commerce
Committee decided to seek a
contempt of Congress citation
against Frank Stanton, the presi
dent of CBS, for refusing to turn
over to it the unedited film (the
"outtakes") that went into the
controversial documentary "The
Selling of the Pentagon."
Several items in the news
recently demonstrate the similar
ities between the political econ
omy of the United States today
and that of the Kingdom of Italy
during the 19305. The corporate
state which Mussolini sought to
establish in Italy was designed to
maintain a rigid a caste structure
in society, a structure which
preserved the old power elite.
This was to be accomplished by
centrally orchestrated bargaining
between organized interest
groups, especially between labor
and management. All such bar
gaining was under the hegemonic
wing of the state itself. The old
ruling caste ensured its control
by manning the levers of power
both in the state and in the
industries.

In my June 22 column, I
discussed the breakdown of the
international airline cartel and
the Civil Aeronautics Board's
efforts to restore the cartel. The
CAB-sustained cartel for airline
service within the state of Texas
has recently broken down also.
Southwest Airlines, modeled on
the cartel-busting Pacific South
west airlines (PSA) of California,
handles only intra-state traffic
and so does not fall under the

CAB power to regulate interstate
commerce.
Braniff International and
Texas International had both
tried for nearly four years to
prevent Southwest from getting
a permit to fly the more
profitable routes within Texas.
Last week, Southwest an
nounced that its coach fare
between Dallas and Houston
would be $20—one-quarter less
than Braniff and Texas Inter
national had been charging.
Braniff and Texas International
both had to lower their prices.

On June 30, the Senate-
House conference committee de
creased the military pay raise
$900 million below what the
House and Senate had approved.
This may have effectively sabo
taged the withering away of
conscription.
Since, however, the House
and the Senate cannot seem to
agree on the Mansfield amend
ment calling for troop with
drawal from Vietnam, there will
be another Senate filibuster on
the draft bill. Several Senators
who did not support Gravel's
and Cranston's earlier filibuster
have said that they will filibuster
if the Mansfield amendment is
not part of the draft bill.

The House had approved a
military pay increase of
$2,711,000,000; the Senate, an
increase of $2,789,000,000 for
the 1971-72 fiscal year. The
conference committee adopted a
figure of $1,803,000,000. Ap
parently the conference commit
tee, which is filled with war
hawks and Pentagon servants,
saw some of their favorite

porkbarrels in the Department
of Defense budget threatened by
money being siphoned off to
end the draft.
The distribution of the pay
raise as suggested by the confer
ence committee is quite differ
ent from that of the Senate bill.
The Senate would have spent the
money on low-ranking enlisted
men and officers—exactly the

elements which need to be
attracted to create an all-volun
teer army. The conference bill
raises pay also in the already
over-paid upper ranks, to which
there is no need to attract
volunteers.
Under the Senate bill the
average recruit would have re
ceived a total of $5320 annually.

The conference bill calls for
$4872. The average recruit's
salary now is about $3000.

The freedom of the press
remains prominent in the news.
The Supreme Court ruled that
the New York Times and the
Washington Post could publish
the Pentagon study of the
Vietnam war. The grounds of
the ruling were that the Solicitor
General had not shown that
there existed some overwhelm
ing threat to national security.
Despite the beneficial results of
the Supreme Court ruling, the
nebulousness of making decis
ions on the basis of whether or
not there is a threat to national
security should not pass unmen
tioned.
