Several items in the news
recently demonstrate the similar
ities between the political econ
omy of the United States today
and that of the Kingdom of Italy
during the 19305. The corporate
state which Mussolini sought to
establish in Italy was designed to
maintain a rigid a caste structure
in society, a structure which
preserved the old power elite.
This was to be accomplished by
centrally orchestrated bargaining
between organized interest
groups, especially between labor
and management. All such bar
gaining was under the hegemonic
wing of the state itself. The old
ruling caste ensured its control
by manning the levers of power
both in the state and in the
industries.

In my June 22 column, I
discussed the breakdown of the
international airline cartel and
the Civil Aeronautics Board's
efforts to restore the cartel. The
CAB-sustained cartel for airline
service within the state of Texas
has recently broken down also.
Southwest Airlines, modeled on
the cartel-busting Pacific South
west airlines (PSA) of California,
handles only intra-state traffic
and so does not fall under the

CAB power to regulate interstate
commerce.
Braniff International and
Texas International had both
tried for nearly four years to
prevent Southwest from getting
a permit to fly the more
profitable routes within Texas.
Last week, Southwest an
nounced that its coach fare
between Dallas and Houston
would be $20—one-quarter less
than Braniff and Texas Inter
national had been charging.
Braniff and Texas International
both had to lower their prices.

On June 30, the Senate-
House conference committee de
creased the military pay raise
$900 million below what the
House and Senate had approved.
This may have effectively sabo
taged the withering away of
conscription.
Since, however, the House
and the Senate cannot seem to
agree on the Mansfield amend
ment calling for troop with
drawal from Vietnam, there will
be another Senate filibuster on
the draft bill. Several Senators
who did not support Gravel's
and Cranston's earlier filibuster
have said that they will filibuster
if the Mansfield amendment is
not part of the draft bill.

The House had approved a
military pay increase of
$2,711,000,000; the Senate, an
increase of $2,789,000,000 for
the 1971-72 fiscal year. The
conference committee adopted a
figure of $1,803,000,000. Ap
parently the conference commit
tee, which is filled with war
hawks and Pentagon servants,
saw some of their favorite

porkbarrels in the Department
of Defense budget threatened by
money being siphoned off to
end the draft.
The distribution of the pay
raise as suggested by the confer
ence committee is quite differ
ent from that of the Senate bill.
The Senate would have spent the
money on low-ranking enlisted
men and officers—exactly the

elements which need to be
attracted to create an all-volun
teer army. The conference bill
raises pay also in the already
over-paid upper ranks, to which
there is no need to attract
volunteers.
Under the Senate bill the
average recruit would have re
ceived a total of $5320 annually.
