FIRE BASE ENCINA, June
29 — Repeated "suicide charges"
into this University stronghold
by Enemy Agents failed this
week as Friendly Forces, under
the command of Gen. William E.
Miller, succeeded in retaining
control of this sensitive outpost.
"They threw their best
stuff at us," said Sgt. Bob
"Greenhorn" Berry, Gen. Mil

ler's press spokesman and chief
of staff. "The Children's Cru
sade, the Bubble Gum Corps.,
the Guilty Liberals Brigade—
everything. But we held our
ground and they were forced to
retreat."
Worst Over
"I would say that the worst is
over for the time being," Berry
said. "But then again, things
could flare up at any moment.
We are investigating."
However, Lt. H. Bruce York,
Enemy Commander of the
Week, told reporters by tele
phone from his strategic Menlo
Park outpost that today's action
"was only a beginning.
"We didn't risk anything, we
didn't gain anything, and we'll
be back," he promised.
"We wanted to feel the
situation out, get a lay of the
land," he said. But, York said,
no actions were planned until
the end of the Long Workers'
Weekend.
Oapt. Janet Wise told report
ers that "if we held the building,
that would have been right on,
but since we didn't, that's right
on, too." She could not elabor
ate.
Casualties
Neither side suffered any
casualties in today's hand-to
typewriter fighting, although
one non-combatant was report
edly dragged from the scene by
his beard and a member of the
Press threatened by an agent
provocateur.
Fire Base Encina has been
characterized as the "nerve cen
ter" and "administration build
ing" for the entire Western
Front of the war. It is normally
womaned by several hundred
Friendly Forces.

Located near the strategic
Plain of the Hoovers, Fire Base
Encina has been the scene of
frequent attacks since May
1969, when the April Third
Movement Army succeeded in
overrunning the outpost and
holding it for seven hours before
being forced to retreat. In recent
years, the Army of the People,
equipped with People's Rocks
and People's Bottles, has play
ed havoc with the delicate glass
panes which shield the base from
the surrounding disruptive ele
ments.
Strategist William Ramshorn,
a strong advocate of electronic
warfare, said the base's early
warning system had held up well
and that the Friendly Forces
were well-prepared for the at
tack.
But, he said, "It sure would
be nice if we could bring in the
National Guard."
That suggestion drew scorn
from Pfc. Lyman Richards,
Guard commander for the Plain
of the Hoovers region.
"I refuse to send my men
into free-fire zones like Building
10 or Fire Base Encina," he said.
"They might get hurt, and
God knows what they'd do to
the Natives."
Berry, however, said that
Miller believes he can hold the
castle against "any number" of
the Enemy hoards.
"We people have all the
power we need," Greenhorn
said, looking at the electricity
meter.
"There's no way we can
lose."

1969, when the April Third
Movement Army succeeded in
overrunning the outpost and
holding it for seven hours before
being forced to retreat. In recent
years, the Army of the People,
equipped with People's Rocks
and People's Bottles, has play
ed havoc with the delicate glass
panes which shield the base from
the surrounding disruptive ele
ments.
Strategist William Ramshorn,
a strong advocate of electronic
warfare, said the base's early
warning system had held up well
and that the Friendly Forces
were well-prepared for the at
tack.
But, he said, "It sure would
be nice if we could bring in the
National Guard."
That suggestion drew scorn
from Pfc. Lyman Richards,
Guard commander for the Plain
of the Hoovers region.
"I refuse to send my men
into free-fire zones like Building
10 or Fire Base Encina," he said.
"They might get hurt, and
God knows what they'd do to
the Natives."
Berry, however, said that
Miller believes he can hold the
castle against "any number" of
the Enemy hoards.
"We people have all the
power we need," Greenhorn
said, looking at the electricity
meter.
"There's no way we can
lose."

FIRE BASE ENCINA, June
29 — Repeated "suicide charges"
into this University stronghold
by Enemy Agents failed this
week as Friendly Forces, under
the command of Gen. William E.
Miller, succeeded in retaining
control of this sensitive outpost.
"They threw their best
stuff at us," said Sgt. Bob
"Greenhorn" Berry, Gen. Mil

ler's press spokesman and chief
of staff. "The Children's Cru
sade, the Bubble Gum Corps.,
the Guilty Liberals Brigade—
everything. But we held our
ground and they were forced to
retreat."
Worst Over
"I would say that the worst is
over for the time being," Berry
said. "But then again, things
could flare up at any moment.
We are investigating."
However, Lt. H. Bruce York,
Enemy Commander of the
Week, told reporters by tele
phone from his strategic Menlo
Park outpost that today's action
"was only a beginning.
"We didn't risk anything, we
didn't gain anything, and we'll
be back," he promised.
"We wanted to feel the
situation out, get a lay of the
land," he said. But, York said,
no actions were planned until
the end of the Long Workers'
Weekend.
Oapt. Janet Wise told report
ers that "if we held the building,
that would have been right on,
but since we didn't, that's right
on, too." She could not elabor
ate.
Casualties
Neither side suffered any
casualties in today's hand-to
typewriter fighting, although
one non-combatant was report
edly dragged from the scene by
his beard and a member of the
Press threatened by an agent
provocateur.
Fire Base Encina has been
characterized as the "nerve cen
ter" and "administration build
ing" for the entire Western
Front of the war. It is normally
womaned by several hundred
Friendly Forces.

Located near the strategic
Plain of the Hoovers, Fire Base
Encina has been the scene of
frequent attacks since May
1969, when the April Third
Movement Army succeeded in
overrunning the outpost and
holding it for seven hours before
being forced to retreat. In recent
