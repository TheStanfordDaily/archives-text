## Viet Veteran Fights Bureaucracy 
### james inglis 
After 21 months in the Army
including 6 in Vietnam, I return
ed to Stanford Spring Quarter to
resume my graduate studies. As
a veteran, 1 am entitled to
educational assistance payments
from the government while I am
in school.
When I filled out the forms
in the Recorder's office for
Stanford to certify me as a
student (a necessary step for the
Veterans Administration to pay
me), the secretary told me that
Stanford would certify me for
Spring Quarter (29 Mar—9
June), recertify me for Summer
Quarter (21 Jun—l4 Aug), and
recertify me for the 71-72
academic year. So I would not
receive benefits for the breaks
between Spring and Summer and
Summer and Fall Quarters.
As a Ph.D. candidate writing
a thesis, I was going to do the
same thing between quarters as
during quarters—work on my
thesis. Thus I felt justified in
seeking to be paid during these
periods also.
So on 8 June I called Walter
Findeisen, Stanford University
Recorder and "Veterans Benefits
expert."
Mr. Findeisen assured me
authoritatively that what his
secretary had told me was
correct. There was no way for
me to receive payments for
those two breaks between quar
ters. Mr. Findeisen sounded as if
he knew what he was talking

about, and I almost let the
matter drop. But in the Army I
had run up against too many
administrators who thought they
knew all the regulations when
they didn't. So I persisted. I
called the VA office in San
Francisco and talked with Mr.
Klemins, Chief of the Education
al Branch. He told me that I
couldn't receive payments for
the Summer-Fall break but I
could for the Spring-Summer
break because it was fairly short.
I walked to Mr. Findeisen's
office, told him, and asked him
to arrange to certify me for the
Spring-Summer break.
Then began a sorry string of
bureaucrat's "dodges"—all the
tricks bureaucrats use to avoid
honestly facing the issue before
them. First the "expert dodge":
Mr. Findeisen was a Veterans
Affairs "expert," Mr. Klemins
was wrong, he knew the regula
tions better than I did (and
presumably Mr. Klemins), there
fore his opinion was right. He
couldn't certify me.
The conversation also had a
Kafkaesque strain through it.
When Findeisen first told me Mr.
Klemins was wrong and he
couldn't certify me for the

Spring-Summer break, I suggest
ed we call Mr. Klemins at the VA
to discuss the matter. He said a
phone call was not acceptable,
rather a letter from the VA he
could keep as a record stating he
could so certify me would be
necessary. A little later I found,
in Mr. Findeisen's won files
which he permitted me to
examine, a letter of guidance
from the VA authorizing exactly
what I had asked.
First he responded with an
other dodge: quibbling with the
phrasing (sample quibble—The
letter states payment for the
Spring-Summer break is permit
ted if (along with other condi
tions) "the summer session ... is
designated as a . . . fourth quar
ter." Mr. Findeisen: "Stanford's
summer session is not a fourth
quarter. It's different, shorter,
etc., etc." Stanford "Summer
Session 71 Bulletin": "For Stan
ford students .. . Summer is a
regular academic quarter.")

Then he changed his conditions.
This letter was not enough, he
needed a letter absolving him of
all responsibility in this matter
from an "appropriate official" at
the VA.
What to do? Mr. Findeisen
was trying to dodge dealing with
my request. So 1 used one of the
"responses to bureaucrat's
dodges" called "see the man's
supervisor." I saw the Registrar.

The next afternoon I saw Mr.
Findeisen. Subdued from the
day before, he welcomed me
into his office, closed the door,
and offered me a chair. He told
me he had talked to people at
the VA on the phone (a letter,
curiously enough, was no longer
necessary), and yes, he could
certify me as 1 had asked.
