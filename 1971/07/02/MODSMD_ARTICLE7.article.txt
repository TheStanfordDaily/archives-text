left-liberal?
(Editor's note. This letter was
published June 7, in the Port
land Oregonian, and refers to an
article originally printed May 7,
in the Washington Post.)
To the Editor: As an alumnus
of Stanford University and hav
ing spent many an hour toiling
on the Stanford University news
paper, the article by Leßoy
Aarons in The Sunday Oregon
ian in respect to the trials of the
present Stanford Daily was of
extreme interest to me.
In reading the article, Editor
Barringer laments what she con
siders to be harrassment and
pressure on the staff of the
Stanford paper. She states that
she has "sought to steer a
liberal-left course for the paper."
Editor Barringer appears to
be quite charitable to herself and
her staff in classifying the
newspaper as "liberal-left." If
the truth were to be known, and
if she were to canvas the present
student body, I am sure she
would find that the students
themselves for the overwhelming
part consider the Stanford Daily,

in its present form, to be a
radical left-wing publication.
In discussing this matter with
numerous Stanford students re
cently, it appears that the
Stanford Daily is pursuing a
course of policy such that
opinion has for the most part
been substituted for the fact in
the coverage of news on campus.
As a result of this course of
partisan approach, the Stanford
Daily no longer apparently has
the confidence or the respect of
the overwhelming majority of
the students. It would naturally
follow that the students, having
lost respect for the Stanford
Daily, the paper itself would be
subject to all forms of partisan
pressure and harassment.
It would, therefore, further
appear that the newspaper staff
itself is primarily to blame for
these circumstances and were
they to revert back to a policy
of reporting the news in the light
of the facts, rather than political
opinion, the problems that Edi
tor Barringer complains of
would probably dissipate and no
longer be a significant factor.

Editor, The Daily:
In light of the recent "hap
penings" within the confines of
this University, many of us have
chosen to express ourselves in
the form of the following
petition.
We, the undersigned, of the
Department of Pediatrics sup
port the following statements:
1. Delete the term "unaccept
able behavior" from the Admini
strative Guide Book as a basis
for dismissing employees.
2. Each employee should be
guaranteed the right of a griev
ance procedure and should not
be dismissed until this right is
exercised.
3. Five employees were dis
missed on June 22nd without
the above rights, therefore they
should be reinstated.
4. A committee composed of
faculty and staff should be set
up to review and revise the
grievance procedure as stated in
the Administrative Guide Book.

signed by 40 members of the
Department of Pediatrics.)

It would, therefore, further
appear that the newspaper staff
itself is primarily to blame for
these circumstances and were
they to revert back to a policy
of reporting the news in the light
of the facts, rather than political
opinion, the problems that Edi
tor Barringer complains of
would probably dissipate and no
longer be a significant factor.

Editor, The Daily:
In light of the recent "hap
penings" within the confines of
this University, many of us have
chosen to express ourselves in
the form of the following
petition.
We, the undersigned, of the
Department of Pediatrics sup
port the following statements:
1. Delete the term "unaccept
able behavior" from the Admini
strative Guide Book as a basis
for dismissing employees.
2. Each employee should be
guaranteed the right of a griev
ance procedure and should not
be dismissed until this right is
exercised.
3. Five employees were dis
missed on June 22nd without
the above rights, therefore they
should be reinstated.
4. A committee composed of
faculty and staff should be set
up to review and revise the
grievance procedure as stated in
the Administrative Guide Book.
(Editors note: This letter was
signed by 40 members of the
Department of Pediatrics.)
left-liberal?
(Editor's note. This letter was
published June 7, in the Port
land Oregonian, and refers to an
article originally printed May 7,
in the Washington Post.)
To the Editor: As an alumnus
of Stanford University and hav
ing spent many an hour toiling
on the Stanford University news
paper, the article by Leßoy
Aarons in The Sunday Oregon
ian in respect to the trials of the
present Stanford Daily was of
extreme interest to me.
In reading the article, Editor
Barringer laments what she con
siders to be harrassment and
pressure on the staff of the
Stanford paper. She states that
she has "sought to steer a
liberal-left course for the paper."
Editor Barringer appears to
be quite charitable to herself and
her staff in classifying the
newspaper as "liberal-left." If
the truth were to be known, and
if she were to canvas the present
student body, I am sure she
would find that the students
themselves for the overwhelming
part consider the Stanford Daily,

in its present form, to be a
radical left-wing publication.
In discussing this matter with
numerous Stanford students re
cently, it appears that the
Stanford Daily is pursuing a
course of policy such that
opinion has for the most part
been substituted for the fact in
the coverage of news on campus.
As a result of this course of
partisan approach, the Stanford
Daily no longer apparently has
the confidence or the respect of
the overwhelming majority of
the students. It would naturally
follow that the students, having
lost respect for the Stanford
Daily, the paper itself would be
subject to all forms of partisan
pressure and harassment.
It would, therefore, further
appear that the newspaper staff
itself is primarily to blame for
these circumstances and were
they to revert back to a policy
of reporting the news in the light
of the facts, rather than political
opinion, the problems that Edi
tor Barringer complains of
