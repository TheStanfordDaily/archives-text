# Tolly's Follies
## The 						Long Weekend 
### Don Tollefson 
One of the more highly-ac
claimed laws which Congress has
passed in recent years was the
one which made three day
weekends out of those weekends
in which a holiday falls on a
Saturday or Sunday.
Many of us will be extremely
grateful for their wisdom, es
pecially when we are eating
breakfast in bed at about 11:00
a.m. this Monday morning.
Yes, this is the weekend in
which we celebrate the birth of
America. For those of you who
are keyed about celebrating such
events, there are any number of
ways to do so this weekend.
Homebodies
Of course you can sit home
and watch TV and listen to the
neighborhood kiddies and drink
or get high by your own chosen
method. When you think of all
the people who will be out and
about, it might not be too bad
an idea to stay at home.
But many people do want to
go out this weekend. There will
be a few on-campus happening.
Tomorrow night at 8:00 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium there
will be a lute concert by
students and faculty members of
the Stanford Summer Workshop
in the Lute.
Tonight from 8:30 to 12:30
p.m., The Great Nameless Won
der Band will perform in the
Lagunita Court Patio. Tickets
are $1.00 and refreshments will
be served.
Performaces of The Beard
will continue tonight and tomor
row night at 8:00 p.m. in the
Little Theater. The Stanford
Museum and Art Gallery will be
closed both Sunday and Mon
day.
Suspense
Tonight at 8:00 p.m. in
Cubberly Auditorium, there will
be a communications double
suspense movie bill with Dead of
Night and Le jour se level The

promoters haven't notified us of
ticket prices, but they can't be
too expensive.
A July 4th celebration is
being planned by the Institute
for The Study of Nonviolence in
three Palo Alto parks this
weekend. An Institute guerilla
theater group will present music,
street theater and a puppet show
as a benefit for the newly
formed People's Union.
The theater group will travel
on a large, flatbed truck former
ly used by the West Coast
Resistance. The People's Union
will use proceeds from the
benefit to finance their farm
cooperative and a print shop
which they are planning.
Rumors
It has been rumored that
Joan Baez, David Harris and
Mimi Farina may make appear
ances, but the theater group
refused to confirm this. The
celebration is scheduled to begin
at 12:30 at Rinconada Park,
then go to Mitchell Park and
finally Flood Park. The theater
group will stay about an hour at
each park.
The biggest event of the
weekend will probably be the
final show at Fillmore West on
Sunday featuring Santana and
Tower of Power, among others.
Tonight the Grateful Dead and
New Riders of the Purple Sage
will play and tomorrow night
Quicksilver, Hot Tuna and Yogi
Phlegm will be featured.
A number of special 4th of
July events will occur in the
surrounding area. Tomorrow and
Sunday there will be a Fourth of
July Weekend in Paris at the
Marin Art and Garden Center in
Ross, near San Rafael.
There will be continuous
Parisian entertainment from
10:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.
If you do go up to Marin
County, there will be a fireworks

display in Sausalito on Sunday
night.
On Sunday the San Francisco
Symphony under the direction
of its former conductor, Josef
Krips, will present a free concert
as part of the Midsummer Music
Festival at Sigmund Stern Grove,
Sloat Blvd. and 19th Ave.
Later, there will be a fire
works display at Candlestick
Park. The display is sponsored
by the Chronicle and will begin
at 9:00 p.m., preceded by
entertainment beginning at 8:00
p.m.
If you want to go to the East
Bay, there will be a big Roller
Derby—Fireworks show at the
Oakland Coliseum. It promises
to be a real "thriller" with a
derby doubleheader beginning at
5:30 p.m. featuring the Bombers
vs the Braves and then the
Bombers vs the Red Devils.
Fireworks begin at 9:00 p.m.,
with tickets ranging from $2.00
to $4.50.
On the peninsula, there will
be a 4th of July parade in
Redwood City, where the "Cli
mate is best by government
test." The action will begin at
Broadway and Marshall streets at
noon, in case any of you
patriotic, parade freaks are inter
ested. At night there will be at
least one local fireworks display
at the Mt. View Recreation
Department. If you want to see
all the Bay Area displays at
once, you can always borrow a
friend's plane.
