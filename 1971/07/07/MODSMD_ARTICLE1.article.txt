# NY Times' Lawyer:
## Judicial Process 'Triumph' 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Alexander Bickel, the New
York Times' lawyer in the battle
over the "Pentagon Papers,"
believes last week's Supreme
Court decision set a "strict
standard" that will discourage
such conflicts in the future.
And Bickel calls the decision,
allowing newspapers to publish a
secret study on the Vietnam
War, "a triumph of the judicial
process."
The Yale Law School profes
sor learned of the Court's
decision in the hills behind
Stanford, where he is finishing a
year at the Center for Advanced
Studies in the Behavioral Sci
ences.
Bickel said the Court's ruling
in favor of the Times and
Washington Post is "diminished
as a landmark decision ... be
cause there is no opinion of the
Court,"and the justices go in
several different ways.
But he said the "decisive"
concurring decisions of Justices
Byron White and Potter Stewart
set "a new statement of First
Amendment law ... adopting a
very strict standard" for govern
ment suppression of newspapers.
immediate' Harm
He predicted their require
ment of "direct, immediate"
harm to suppress publications in
the name of national security
will make it difficult in future
cases for the government to
argue that "remote inconven
ience to diplomatic relationships
is sufficient."
Bickel, who will return to
Yale July 12, has spent a year at
Stanford's secluded Behavioral
Sciences Institute. He said he
wrote a book and "did what
people do in this glorious mo
tel." He happened to be in New
York "when the heavens fell in"

and was asked to represent the
Times.
Bickel, 46, said he is "by no
means" a specialist on journalis
tic law. But he had earlier been
working on a brief for another
Times case, defending the con
fidentiality of reporter Earl
Caldwell's contacts in the Black
Panthers.
Describing recent legal battles
between press and government,
Bickel said, "I view the whole
thing as kind of sad. Those rights
are most secure that are never
litigated.
"We are obviously witnessing
some kind of breakdown or
malfunction in the adversary
relation between the press and
government," Bickel comment
ed, but he said no single cause
could explain the problem.
Daily's Suit
Asked about the Daily's suit
to bar repeats of an April search
of the Daily offices by police
seeking photographs, Bickel said,
"It seems to me a verv different
matter from the Times' case."
Although noting he did not
know details of the case, Bickel
said, "The fact that a cop steps
into a newspaper office surprises
me no more than if a cop steps
into my bedroomâ€”which he can
do with a search warrant."
But he added such searches
for evidence should be limited
by "some rights to preserve the
confidentiality of sources" and
to prevent the government
"looking over your shoulder as
you work."
Bickel believes the govern
ment's mistake in its fight
against publishing the "Pentagon
Papers" was the assumption it
could extend its internal security
controls to the press.
"As we argued, this case
didn't have to do with the

President's authority to establish
security classifications. We did
n't have to challenge any of that.
"Here, the government was
coming out of its own shell,
trying to impose its [internal
controls] on the outside world."
Bickel said the government
submitted to the Supreme Court
a dizzying torrent of secret
documents that is said were
dangerous to national security.
"What we know is that of all the
judges who passed on these
specifications, the overwhelming
majority found nothing suf
ficiently dangerous."
Invasion of Privacy
He said the government also
failed to "analogize the United
States in this case to a private
person," with special rights a
gainst invasion of privacy.
He noted the government's
efforts are now shifting to
Daniel Ellsberg, the self-admitted
"leak" within the government.
But he said convicting Ellsberg
will require proving he violated a
specific security law. "The Pres
ident's inherent authority can't
reach to a criminal process."
Bickel praised the Times'
actions throughout the legal
struggle. "I think they were
magnificent, and I thought the
initial action [of publication]
that they took was a highly
courageous action in the public
interest.
"You could well imagine an
institution like this being tempt
ed to compromise the matter.
They certainly were invited to
do that... by negotiating their
way out of it."

Bickel said the government's
attempts to suppress publication
of the documents were "unwise
but not unnatural. I don't have
the feeling there was some kind
of evil conspiracy. After all, this
was a fairly unprecedented kind
of leak in its massive nature."
He added the Times-Post
victory justified his faith as a
"due process liberal. The institu

tions worked the way they are
meant to work."
He said in England the whole
thing would be settled "in some
club." In France, "the Securite
Nationale would come in and
arrest everyone. But in this case,
they didn't send the Marines to
break down the door of the New
York Times. They went to Court
with it and they lost."
