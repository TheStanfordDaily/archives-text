# Good, Bad, News At Local Theaters

### DON TOLLEFSON 
Rare is the movie that re
ceives unanimous praise or unan
imous criticism. More usual is
the picture which gets some
good and some bad reviews, but
mainly "just another movie"
type of review.
Two movies which have open
ed recently in the Bay Area have
been notable, even to people
who haven't seen them, because
both have received some very
good and some very bad reviews.
Any similarity between the
two movies probably ends at
that point. I made no conscious
attempt to continue the pattern
of widely differing viewpoints
about the two movies, "Drive,
He Said" and "Summer of '42,"
but I came away being very
impressed with one and fairly
disappointed with the other.
"Drive, He Said" is the first
effort of Jack Nicholson as a
director, I loved Jack Nicholson
as an actor. When I saw him first
as the inept, small-town lawyer
in "Easy Rider," I felt that he
stole the show in an incredibly
"heavy" movie, which included
many other outstanding per
formances.
Lacks Continuity
Nicholson shows flashes of
talent in his new role. But his
film lacks the continuity it needs
to make it work, at least for me.
"Drive, He Said" docs ex
plore important questions. Are
college athletics too semi-profes
sional and irrelevant? Aren't
there many more important
things in life than basketball,
even for a superstar? Is "win
ning" the only thing that
counts?
But the movie doesn't really
completely follow through. It
takes critical looks at the greed
of professional sports people and
at some of the other problems
facing athletics. But it never
really progresses and fully tack
les the central issue of the
validity of college athletics or
anything else for today's stu
dents.
One problem is the film's
"star," William Tepper. Tepper
is not always able to successfully
portray the disenchanted basket
ball superstar who is going
through a serious identity crisis.
His roommate (Michael Mar
gotta) is the radical who trys to
convince Tepper that athletics
are nothing more than "staying
after school in your under
pants." He may not be Tepper's
alter ego, but he is a major force
in making him reexamine his
role as a superstar.
Stereotyped Radical
Some of Margotta's scenes are
extremely good, especially a
very humorous one where he
tries to escape the draft by
feigning insanity at the induc
tion center. At times though, he
becomes too much of a stereo
typed, clichaic, college revolu
tionary.
Possibly the most brilliant
thing about the film is its
cinematography. Sports lend
themselves perfectly to creative
camera work and Bill Butler has
mixed slow motion and other
visual effects to create an incred
ibly beautiful view of basketball.
The film was originally rated
X, but Columbia Pictures appeal
ed the decision and was granted

an R rating. There are some
unnecessary scenes of nudity in
the film. Especially stupid is one
in the team's shower following a
game which Nicholson must
have included to destroy any
myths about the size of athlete's
sexual organs.
This and an extremely un
aesthetic lovemaking scene really
are less-than-skillful or beautiful
uses of nudity which can only be
called exploitive.
Ups and Downs
Nicholson does some good
things. He focuses on some
important issues and parts of the
movie are strong. But "Drive, He
Said" had as many downs as ups
for me and didn't work as a
complete or moving experience.
"Summer of '42" did. It is
probably one of the most

moving films I have ever seen.
Director Robert Mulligan has
adapted Herman Raucher's novel
into a unique screen experience.
The film is totally engrossing for
its entire length of nearly two
hours.
"Summer of '42" is a story of
three young teenage boys who
spend a summer on a vacation
island. The three young actors
are all good, especially the main
star, Gary Grimes.
Grimes is the most likeable of
the three, flanked by a reticent,
shy kid with glasses (Oliver
Conant) and a rowdy, chubby
kid (Jerry Hauser). The kids
spend a usual adolescent summer
of fooling around, until Grimes
falls in love with the wife of a
soldier off to war. Jennifer

O'Neill is beautiful as the total
ly-in-love soldier's wife.
Growing Up
Grimes' whole life changes as
the film focuses on his growing
up, sexually and mentally. The
climactic scene of the movie is
beautifully tragic and it moved
me as much as almost any movie
scene I've ever seen.
The film is rated R, but this is
a shame. A large part of the film
Is concerned with sex, but it is
handled so naturally and beauti
fully, that I don't see how
anyone could possibly consider
it to be dirty.
The outdoor scenes were shot
in Northern California and the
scenery and photography are
both beautiful. The music by

Michel Legrand is haunting and
it fits the theme beautifully.
As advertisements for the
film say, "In Everyone's Life,
There's a Summer of '42."
Anyone who can remember the
awkward time of childhood
when you are just beginning to
grow up, can relate to the film.
And the experience of growing
up is depicted so well in the
movie, you have to be moved.
Everything in the movie
worked for me as did the film as
a whole. "Summer of '42" is a
complete experience. The music,
acting, photography and dia
logue are all nearly flawlessly
co-ordinated in a nostalgic and
heartwarming recreation of
those days we all went through
when we took the first steps into
adulthood.
