## 'Cyclops': Detecting Life In Space 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Is anybody there?
Or are we all alone in a big,
empty universe?
The idea that man lies at the
center of creation, condemned
to universal loneliness, is slowly
becoming passe. It is the convic
tion of most scientists that
intelligent life exists on other
planets. What it would take to
find that life, in the way of
equipment, time, money, and
social commitment, is the sub
ject of a summer study at
NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View.
Cosponsored by NASA and
by Stanford, the program is
officially known as Project
Cyclops, the image being one of
a great eye looking outward.
Director of Cyclops is Dr.
Bernard Oliver, who in "real
life" is Vice-President for Re
search at Hewlett-Packard in
Palo Alto, but who, for now, is a
Visiting Professor in the Depart
ment of Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
Dr. Oliver, a Stanford alum
nus (Class of '35), is leading a
team of 20 professors who have
come from all over the country
to participate in this Faculty
Fellowship Program. Previous
summer programs at Ames have
included designs for a scientific
base on the moon (Moonlab),
studies of urban transportation,
and recommendations for curb
ing pollution in the Bay Area.
This year's project is a bit more
speculative.
Heavy Elements
"Present thinking" explains
Dr. Oliver, "is that planetary
systems exist around every Pop
ulation I star." (A Population I
star is a star that has been
formed out of the heavy ele
ments that are left over from the
supernova explosions of an earli
er generation of stars. Popula
tion II stars, the original stars
formed out of almost pure
hydrogen and helium, are now
relatively rare.)
"Population I stars are in the
majority, and in general as they
form they are spinning, and they
have to get rid of a lot of this
spin in order to become spheri
cal stars. They do this by casting
off planets. It is further believed
that around middle-class stars of
this nature, there will, in general,
be habitable planets.
"In order for a planet to
support intelligent life, it is
necessary for the planet to have
been around long enough for
such life to evolve, so you need
to have a star with a lifetime of
several billion years. This ex
cludes some of the hotter and
brighter stars, which burn them
selves out when they are still
babies. Cliant babies, I should
say.
Middle-class Stars
"It excludes some of the
very, very weak stars (one-half
of the sun's mass), which radiate
such small amounts of heat that
in order for a planet to be warm
enough it has to get too close,
and then tide-raising forces stop
it from rotating.
"So, in the range of middle
class stars such as our sun, it is
believed that a fair fraction
contain habitable planets. The

exobiologists claim that if you
have a hospitable environment,
it is almost certain that life will
evolve on it.
"So we contemplate a uni
verse that is really teeming with
life. The question is, how much
of it at this stage in time has
reached an intelligent or 'com
municative' level of existence?
'Communicative' Existence
"By 'communicative' I mean
it radiates megawatts of radio
signals that can be picked up.
Estimates on this vary from one
star in a few hundred to one star
in hundreds of millions. So there
is a very broad range of uncer
tainty there. What this essen
tially does is to determine the
size of the antenna system you
need and the amount of data
processing equipment you need
to look for this signal.
"This is a needle in the
haystack problem."
The signals that Project
Cyclops envisions are of two
types. One is radio "leakage,"
the normal communications car
ried out by an intelligent species
that occasionally "leak" into
space. American television pro
grams constantly "leak" into the
nether regions, and television
"bounce" from the moon is
often a source of irritation to
radio scientists studying that
body. So it is not unreasonable
to expect that other civilizations
will also leak some of their
signals into space.
Contact
The other type of signal
considered by Cyclops is the
radio beacon, the conscious and
intentional transmission of sig
nals into space in order to
establish contact with other
civilizations.
Although the purpose of this
summer's study is to define what
would be necessary to detect
radio transmissions from outer
space, preliminary ideas have
already formed. The present
thinking is that the giant "eye"
might consist of 10,000 para
bolic dishes 100 feet in diame
ter. (Stanford's Big Dish is 150
feet in diameter.) The dishes
would be positioned in a 100 by
100 array, each dish placed
about 100 meters from its
neighbors.
The cost of such a system
would be, to coin a phrase,
astronomical. Dr. Oliver esti
mates that, with mass produc
tion, the cost of each antenna
could be brought into the
$100-$300,000 range. The cost
of the antennas alone would
thus be more than one billion
dollars.
Costs Are Relative
Dr. Oliver is quick to point
out that costs arc always
relative. "This thing," he says,
"could be built for what Dave
Packard has saved in the military
budget. You talk about large
sums of money in one breath,
and then you realize that in
crements iin your present econ
omy can do it."
But is the United States
prepared to spend such large
sums of money on such a
project?
Dr. Oliver feels that the
potential exists. "I have found a

great deal of receptivity among
the non-scientific community to
the idea of detecting other life,"
he says. "In fact, I think that
this is one of the things that gave
some luster to the space program
in its original phases. I think that
when the first Mariner photo
graphs came back from Mars and
showed it to be crater-like, like
the moon, and when the Venus
probe showed that the surface of
Venus was hot enough to melt
lead, a lot of luster went out of
the space program at that point.
"We had proved our solar
system to be fairly barren, and if
we are going to find life it is
quite obvious that we are going
to have to look farther into
space.
Evaluation
"Contrary to what was stated
in the headline in the (San
Francisco) Chronicle, there is
not a big U.S. commitment to
this intelligent life search at this
point. Cyclops is simply an
attempt to evaluate what it
would take to do the job.
Whether we do the job or not is
an independent decision that
we'll have to make later."
An important aspect of the
study is the ancillary benefit of
having such a large array available
for scientific work. "One must
realize," says Dr. Oliver, "that if
one made the equipment neces
sary to do this search, one would
at the same time construct a
superb radio astronomical instru
ment."
Better Communication
It is estimated that the array
envisioned in Cyclops would
permit communication with a
spacecraft 100 times more dis
tant than is presently possible,
or allow a 10,000-fold increase
in "channel capacity" (the
amount of information that can
be transmitted in a given time)
for a spacecraft at present
ranges. Thus, spacecraft visiting
the outer planets would be able
to transmit detailed television
pictures back to earth.
Undertaking a study such as
Cyclops leads one to look upon
the human predicament from a
somewhat different perspective.
"The task of getting in contact
with other cultures," says Dr.
Oliver, "is of a difficulty that is
inversely proportional to the
ability of cultures to survive. If
men have evolved for billions of
years from the simplest forms to
our present complexity, and if
we now wipe ourselves out
through our own stupidity, and
therefore don't exist in the
communicative phase for more
than a few hundred or a few
thousand years out of the
billions of years that a star
exists, and if that is typical of
civilizations everywhere, then
the whole interstellar communi
cation problem is hopeless, be
cause even though there may
have been habitable and hospita
ble planets around many sta's,
the fraction of those that will
now be supporting life is negligi
ble.
"Whereas, if we can solve
these problems, and if we can
learn how to survive and pre
serve our planet not just anoth
er millenium, but in fact a

billion years or more, and if
that's typical of civilizations
everywhere, then the interstellar
communication problem itself
becomes very easy, because
there will be life scattered very,
very densely throughout the
universe, and our nearest neigh
bors will be quite close to us.
"So you see, in a way,
studying the problem of inter
stellar communication once
again brings home to us the
necessity of surviving as a
species, in order that someday
we might participate in contact
with other cultures who have
also solved that same problem.
It's just another reason.
"I guess what I'm talking
about is 'after ecology, what?'"

"By 'communicative' I mean
it radiates megawatts of radio
signals that can be picked up.
Estimates on this vary from one
star in a few hundred to one star
in hundreds of millions. So there
is a very broad range of uncer
tainty there. What this essen
tially does is to determine the
size of the antenna system you
need and the amount of data
processing equipment you need
to look for this signal.
"This is a needle in the
haystack problem."
The signals that Project
Cyclops envisions are of two
types. One is radio "leakage,"
the normal communications car
ried out by an intelligent species
that occasionally "leak" into
space. American television pro
grams constantly "leak" into the
nether regions, and television
"bounce" from the moon is
often a source of irritation to
radio scientists studying that
body. So it is not unreasonable
to expect that other civilizations
will also leak some of their
signals into space.
Contact
The other type of signal
considered by Cyclops is the
radio beacon, the conscious and
intentional transmission of sig
nals into space in order to
establish contact with other
civilizations.
Although the purpose of this
summer's study is to define what
would be necessary to detect
radio transmissions from outer
space, preliminary ideas have
already formed. The present
thinking is that the giant "eye"
might consist of 10,000 para
bolic dishes 100 feet in diame
ter. (Stanford's Big Dish is 150
feet in diameter.) The dishes
would be positioned in a 100 by
100 array, each dish placed
about 100 meters from its
neighbors.
The cost of such a system
would be, to coin a phrase,
astronomical. Dr. Oliver esti
mates that, with mass produc
tion, the cost of each antenna
could be brought into the
$100-$300,000 range. The cost
of the antennas alone would
thus be more than one billion
dollars.
Costs Are Relative
Dr. Oliver is quick to point
out that costs arc always
relative. "This thing," he says,
"could be built for what Dave
Packard has saved in the military
budget. You talk about large
sums of money in one breath,
and then you realize that in
crements iin your present econ
omy can do it."
But is the United States
prepared to spend such large
sums of money on such a
project?
Dr. Oliver feels that the
potential exists. "I have found a

great deal of receptivity among
the non-scientific community to
the idea of detecting other life,"
he says. "In fact, I think that
this is one of the things that gave
some luster to the space program
in its original phases. I think that
when the first Mariner photo
graphs came back from Mars and
showed it to be crater-like, like
the moon, and when the Venus
probe showed that the surface of
Venus was hot enough to melt
lead, a lot of luster went out of
the space program at that point.
"We had proved our solar
system to be fairly barren, and if
we are going to find life it is
quite obvious that we are going
to have to look farther into
space.
Evaluation
"Contrary to what was stated
in the headline in the (San
Francisco) Chronicle, there is
not a big U.S. commitment to
this intelligent life search at this
point. Cyclops is simply an
attempt to evaluate what it
would take to do the job.
Whether we do the job or not is
an independent decision that
we'll have to make later."
An important aspect of the
study is the ancillary benefit of
having such a large array available
for scientific work. "One must
realize," says Dr. Oliver, "that if
one made the equipment neces
sary to do this search, one would
at the same time construct a
superb radio astronomical instru
ment."
Better Communication
It is estimated that the array
envisioned in Cyclops would
permit communication with a
spacecraft 100 times more dis
tant than is presently possible,
or allow a 10,000-fold increase
in "channel capacity" (the
amount of information that can
be transmitted in a given time)
for a spacecraft at present
ranges. Thus, spacecraft visiting
the outer planets would be able
to transmit detailed television
pictures back to earth.
Undertaking a study such as
Cyclops leads one to look upon
the human predicament from a
somewhat different perspective.
"The task of getting in contact
with other cultures," says Dr.
Oliver, "is of a difficulty that is
inversely proportional to the
ability of cultures to survive. If
men have evolved for billions of
years from the simplest forms to
our present complexity, and if
we now wipe ourselves out
through our own stupidity, and
therefore don't exist in the
communicative phase for more
than a few hundred or a few
thousand years out of the
billions of years that a star
exists, and if that is typical of
civilizations everywhere, then
the whole interstellar communi
cation problem is hopeless, be
cause even though there may
have been habitable and hospita
ble planets around many sta's,
the fraction of those that will
now be supporting life is negligi
ble.
"Whereas, if we can solve
these problems, and if we can
learn how to survive and pre
serve our planet not just anoth
er millenium, but in fact a

billion years or more, and if
that's typical of civilizations
everywhere, then the interstellar
communication problem itself
becomes very easy, because
there will be life scattered very,
very densely throughout the
universe, and our nearest neigh
bors will be quite close to us.
"So you see, in a way,
studying the problem of inter
stellar communication once
again brings home to us the
necessity of surviving as a
species, in order that someday
we might participate in contact
with other cultures who have
also solved that same problem.
It's just another reason.
"I guess what I'm talking
about is 'after ecology, what?'"
Is anybody there?
Or are we all alone in a big,
empty universe?
The idea that man lies at the
center of creation, condemned
to universal loneliness, is slowly
becoming passe. It is the convic
tion of most scientists that
intelligent life exists on other
planets. What it would take to
find that life, in the way of
equipment, time, money, and
social commitment, is the sub
ject of a summer study at
NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View.
Cosponsored by NASA and
by Stanford, the program is
officially known as Project
Cyclops, the image being one of
a great eye looking outward.
Director of Cyclops is Dr.
Bernard Oliver, who in "real
life" is Vice-President for Re
search at Hewlett-Packard in
Palo Alto, but who, for now, is a
Visiting Professor in the Depart
ment of Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
Dr. Oliver, a Stanford alum
nus (Class of '35), is leading a
team of 20 professors who have
come from all over the country
to participate in this Faculty
Fellowship Program. Previous
summer programs at Ames have
included designs for a scientific
base on the moon (Moonlab),
studies of urban transportation,
and recommendations for curb
ing pollution in the Bay Area.
This year's project is a bit more
speculative.
Heavy Elements
"Present thinking" explains
Dr. Oliver, "is that planetary
systems exist around every Pop
ulation I star." (A Population I
star is a star that has been
formed out of the heavy ele
ments that are left over from the
supernova explosions of an earli
er generation of stars. Popula
tion II stars, the original stars
formed out of almost pure
hydrogen and helium, are now
relatively rare.)
"Population I stars are in the
majority, and in general as they
form they are spinning, and they
have to get rid of a lot of this
spin in order to become spheri
cal stars. They do this by casting
off planets. It is further believed
that around middle-class stars of
this nature, there will, in general,
be habitable planets.
"In order for a planet to
support intelligent life, it is
necessary for the planet to have
been around long enough for
such life to evolve, so you need
to have a star with a lifetime of
several billion years. This ex
cludes some of the hotter and
brighter stars, which burn them
selves out when they are still
babies. Cliant babies, I should
say.
Middle-class Stars
"It excludes some of the
very, very weak stars (one-half
of the sun's mass), which radiate
such small amounts of heat that
in order for a planet to be warm
enough it has to get too close,
and then tide-raising forces stop
it from rotating.
"So, in the range of middle
class stars such as our sun, it is
believed that a fair fraction
contain habitable planets. The

exobiologists claim that if you
have a hospitable environment,
it is almost certain that life will
evolve on it.
"So we contemplate a uni
verse that is really teeming with
life. The question is, how much
of it at this stage in time has
reached an intelligent or 'com
municative' level of existence?
'Communicative' Existence
"By 'communicative' I mean

Francisco) Chronicle, there is
not a big U.S. commitment to
this intelligent life search at this
point. Cyclops is simply an
attempt to evaluate what it
would take to do the job.
Whether we do the job or not is
an independent decision that
we'll have to make later."
An important aspect of the
study is the ancillary benefit of
having such a large array available
for scientific work. "One must
realize," says Dr. Oliver, "that if
one made the equipment neces
sary to do this search, one would
at the same time construct a
superb radio astronomical instru
ment."
Better Communication
It is estimated that the array
envisioned in Cyclops would
permit communication with a
spacecraft 100 times more dis
tant than is presently possible,
or allow a 10,000-fold increase
in "channel capacity" (the
amount of information that can
be transmitted in a given time)
for a spacecraft at present
ranges. Thus, spacecraft visiting
the outer planets would be able
to transmit detailed television
pictures back to earth.
Undertaking a study such as
Cyclops leads one to look upon
the human predicament from a
somewhat different perspective.
"The task of getting in contact
with other cultures," says Dr.
Oliver, "is of a difficulty that is
inversely proportional to the
ability of cultures to survive. If
men have evolved for billions of
years from the simplest forms to
our present complexity, and if
we now wipe ourselves out
through our own stupidity, and
therefore don't exist in the
communicative phase for more
than a few hundred or a few
thousand years out of the
billions of years that a star
exists, and if that is typical of
civilizations everywhere, then
the whole interstellar communi
cation problem is hopeless, be
cause even though there may
have been habitable and hospita
ble planets around many sta's,
the fraction of those that will
now be supporting life is negligi
ble.
"Whereas, if we can solve
these problems, and if we can
learn how to survive and pre
serve our planet not just anoth
er millenium, but in fact a

billion years or more, and if
that's typical of civilizations
everywhere, then the interstellar
communication problem itself
becomes very easy, because
there will be life scattered very,
very densely throughout the
universe, and our nearest neigh
bors will be quite close to us.
"So you see, in a way,
studying the problem of inter
stellar communication once
again brings home to us the
necessity of surviving as a
species, in order that someday
we might participate in contact
with other cultures who have
also solved that same problem.
It's just another reason.
"I guess what I'm talking
about is 'after ecology, what?'"
Is anybody there?
Or are we all alone in a big,
empty universe?
The idea that man lies at the
center of creation, condemned
to universal loneliness, is slowly
becoming passe. It is the convic
tion of most scientists that
intelligent life exists on other
planets. What it would take to
find that life, in the way of
equipment, time, money, and
social commitment, is the sub
ject of a summer study at
NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View.
Cosponsored by NASA and
by Stanford, the program is
officially known as Project
Cyclops, the image being one of
a great eye looking outward.
Director of Cyclops is Dr.
Bernard Oliver, who in "real
life" is Vice-President for Re
search at Hewlett-Packard in
Palo Alto, but who, for now, is a
Visiting Professor in the Depart
ment of Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
Dr. Oliver, a Stanford alum
nus (Class of '35), is leading a
team of 20 professors who have
come from all over the country
to participate in this Faculty
Fellowship Program. Previous
summer programs at Ames have
included designs for a scientific
base on the moon (Moonlab),
studies of urban transportation,
and recommendations for curb
ing pollution in the Bay Area.
This year's project is a bit more
speculative.
Heavy Elements
"Present thinking" explains
Dr. Oliver, "is that planetary
systems exist around every Pop
ulation I star." (A Population I
star is a star that has been
formed out of the heavy ele
ments that are left over from the
supernova explosions of an earli
er generation of stars. Popula
tion II stars, the original stars
formed out of almost pure
hydrogen and helium, are now
relatively rare.)
"Population I stars are in the
majority, and in general as they
form they are spinning, and they
have to get rid of a lot of this
spin in order to become spheri
cal stars. They do this by casting
off planets. It is further believed
that around middle-class stars of
this nature, there will, in general,
be habitable planets.
"In order for a planet to
support intelligent life, it is
necessary for the planet to have
been around long enough for
such life to evolve, so you need
to have a star with a lifetime of
several billion years. This ex
cludes some of the hotter and
brighter stars, which burn them
selves out when they are still
babies. Cliant babies, I should
say.
Middle-class Stars
"It excludes some of the
very, very weak stars (one-half
of the sun's mass), which radiate
such small amounts of heat that
in order for a planet to be warm
enough it has to get too close,
and then tide-raising forces stop
it from rotating.
"So, in the range of middle
class stars such as our sun, it is
believed that a fair fraction
contain habitable planets. The

exobiologists claim that if you
have a hospitable environment,
it is almost certain that life will
evolve on it.
"So we contemplate a uni
verse that is really teeming with
life. The question is, how much
of it at this stage in time has
reached an intelligent or 'com
municative' level of existence?
'Communicative' Existence
"By 'communicative' I mean
it radiates megawatts of radio
signals that can be picked up.
Estimates on this vary from one
star in a few hundred to one star
in hundreds of millions. So there
is a very broad range of uncer
tainty there. What this essen
tially does is to determine the
size of the antenna system you
need and the amount of data
processing equipment you need
to look for this signal.
"This is a needle in the
haystack problem."
The signals that Project
Cyclops envisions are of two
types. One is radio "leakage,"
the normal communications car
ried out by an intelligent species
that occasionally "leak" into
space. American television pro
grams constantly "leak" into the
nether regions, and television
"bounce" from the moon is
often a source of irritation to
radio scientists studying that
body. So it is not unreasonable
to expect that other civilizations
will also leak some of their
signals into space.
Contact
The other type of signal
considered by Cyclops is the
radio beacon, the conscious and
intentional transmission of sig
nals into space in order to
establish contact with other
civilizations.
Although the purpose of this
summer's study is to define what
would be necessary to detect
radio transmissions from outer
space, preliminary ideas have
already formed. The present
thinking is that the giant "eye"
might consist of 10,000 para
bolic dishes 100 feet in diame
ter. (Stanford's Big Dish is 150
feet in diameter.) The dishes
would be positioned in a 100 by
100 array, each dish placed
about 100 meters from its
neighbors.
The cost of such a system
would be, to coin a phrase,
astronomical. Dr. Oliver esti
mates that, with mass produc
tion, the cost of each antenna
could be brought into the
$100-$300,000 range. The cost
of the antennas alone would
thus be more than one billion
dollars.
Costs Are Relative
Dr. Oliver is quick to point
out that costs arc always
relative. "This thing," he says,
"could be built for what Dave
Packard has saved in the military
budget. You talk about large
sums of money in one breath,
and then you realize that in
crements iin your present econ
omy can do it."
But is the United States
prepared to spend such large
sums of money on such a
project?
Dr. Oliver feels that the
potential exists. "I have found a

great deal of receptivity among
the non-scientific community to
the idea of detecting other life,"
he says. "In fact, I think that
this is one of the things that gave
some luster to the space program
in its original phases. I think that
when the first Mariner photo
graphs came back from Mars and
showed it to be crater-like, like
the moon, and when the Venus
probe showed that the surface of
Venus was hot enough to melt
lead, a lot of luster went out of
the space program at that point.
"We had proved our solar
system to be fairly barren, and if
we are going to find life it is
quite obvious that we are going
to have to look farther into
space.
Evaluation
"Contrary to what was stated
in the headline in the (San
Francisco) Chronicle, there is
not a big U.S. commitment to
this intelligent life search at this
point. Cyclops is simply an
attempt to evaluate what it
would take to do the job.

Cyclops, the image being one of
a great eye looking outward.
Director of Cyclops is Dr.
Bernard Oliver, who in "real
life" is Vice-President for Re
search at Hewlett-Packard in
Palo Alto, but who, for now, is a
Visiting Professor in the Depart
ment of Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
Dr. Oliver, a Stanford alum
nus (Class of '35), is leading a
team of 20 professors who have
come from all over the country
to participate in this Faculty
Fellowship Program. Previous
summer programs at Ames have
included designs for a scientific
base on the moon (Moonlab),
studies of urban transportation,
and recommendations for curb
ing pollution in the Bay Area.
This year's project is a bit more
speculative.
Heavy Elements
"Present thinking" explains
Dr. Oliver, "is that planetary
systems exist around every Pop
ulation I star." (A Population I
star is a star that has been
formed out of the heavy ele
ments that are left over from the
supernova explosions of an earli
er generation of stars. Popula
tion II stars, the original stars
formed out of almost pure
hydrogen and helium, are now
relatively rare.)
"Population I stars are in the
majority, and in general as they
form they are spinning, and they
have to get rid of a lot of this
spin in order to become spheri
cal stars. They do this by casting
off planets. It is further believed
that around middle-class stars of
this nature, there will, in general,
be habitable planets.
"In order for a planet to
support intelligent life, it is
necessary for the planet to have
been around long enough for
such life to evolve, so you need
to have a star with a lifetime of
several billion years. This ex
cludes some of the hotter and
brighter stars, which burn them
selves out when they are still
babies. Cliant babies, I should
say.
Middle-class Stars
"It excludes some of the
very, very weak stars (one-half
of the sun's mass), which radiate
such small amounts of heat that
in order for a planet to be warm
enough it has to get too close,
and then tide-raising forces stop
it from rotating.
"So, in the range of middle
class stars such as our sun, it is
believed that a fair fraction
contain habitable planets. The

exobiologists claim that if you
have a hospitable environment,
it is almost certain that life will
evolve on it.
"So we contemplate a uni
verse that is really teeming with
life. The question is, how much
of it at this stage in time has
reached an intelligent or 'com
municative' level of existence?
'Communicative' Existence
"By 'communicative' I mean
it radiates megawatts of radio
signals that can be picked up.
Estimates on this vary from one
star in a few hundred to one star
in hundreds of millions. So there
is a very broad range of uncer
tainty there. What this essen
tially does is to determine the
size of the antenna system you
need and the amount of data
processing equipment you need
to look for this signal.
"This is a needle in the
haystack problem."
The signals that Project
Cyclops envisions are of two
types. One is radio "leakage,"
the normal communications car
ried out by an intelligent species
that occasionally "leak" into
space. American television pro
grams constantly "leak" into the
nether regions, and television
"bounce" from the moon is
often a source of irritation to
radio scientists studying that
body. So it is not unreasonable
to expect that other civilizations
will also leak some of their
signals into space.
Contact
The other type of signal
considered by Cyclops is the
radio beacon, the conscious and
intentional transmission of sig
nals into space in order to
establish contact with other
civilizations.
Although the purpose of this
summer's study is to define what
would be necessary to detect
radio transmissions from outer
space, preliminary ideas have
already formed. The present
thinking is that the giant "eye"
might consist of 10,000 para
bolic dishes 100 feet in diame
ter. (Stanford's Big Dish is 150
feet in diameter.) The dishes
would be positioned in a 100 by
100 array, each dish placed
about 100 meters from its
neighbors.
The cost of such a system
would be, to coin a phrase,
astronomical. Dr. Oliver esti
mates that, with mass produc
tion, the cost of each antenna
could be brought into the
$100-$300,000 range. The cost
of the antennas alone would
thus be more than one billion
dollars.
Costs Are Relative
Dr. Oliver is quick to point
out that costs arc always
relative. "This thing," he says,
"could be built for what Dave
Packard has saved in the military
budget. You talk about large
sums of money in one breath,
and then you realize that in
crements iin your present econ
omy can do it."
But is the United States
prepared to spend such large
sums of money on such a
project?
Dr. Oliver feels that the
potential exists. "I have found a

great deal of receptivity among
the non-scientific community to
the idea of detecting other life,"
he says. "In fact, I think that
this is one of the things that gave
some luster to the space program
in its original phases. I think that
when the first Mariner photo
graphs came back from Mars and
showed it to be crater-like, like
the moon, and when the Venus
probe showed that the surface of
Venus was hot enough to melt
lead, a lot of luster went out of
the space program at that point.
"We had proved our solar
system to be fairly barren, and if
we are going to find life it is
quite obvious that we are going
to have to look farther into
space.
Evaluation
"Contrary to what was stated
in the headline in the (San
Francisco) Chronicle, there is
not a big U.S. commitment to
this intelligent life search at this
point. Cyclops is simply an
attempt to evaluate what it
would take to do the job.
Whether we do the job or not is
an independent decision that
we'll have to make later."
An important aspect of the
study is the ancillary benefit of
having such a large array available
for scientific work. "One must
realize," says Dr. Oliver, "that if
one made the equipment neces
sary to do this search, one would
at the same time construct a
superb radio astronomical instru
ment."
Better Communication
It is estimated that the array
envisioned in Cyclops would
permit communication with a
spacecraft 100 times more dis
tant than is presently possible,
or allow a 10,000-fold increase
in "channel capacity" (the
amount of information that can
be transmitted in a given time)
for a spacecraft at present
ranges. Thus, spacecraft visiting
the outer planets would be able
to transmit detailed television
pictures back to earth.
Undertaking a study such as
Cyclops leads one to look upon
the human predicament from a
somewhat different perspective.
"The task of getting in contact
with other cultures," says Dr.
Oliver, "is of a difficulty that is
inversely proportional to the
ability of cultures to survive. If
men have evolved for billions of
years from the simplest forms to
our present complexity, and if
we now wipe ourselves out
through our own stupidity, and
therefore don't exist in the
communicative phase for more
than a few hundred or a few
thousand years out of the
billions of years that a star
exists, and if that is typical of
civilizations everywhere, then
the whole interstellar communi
cation problem is hopeless, be
cause even though there may
have been habitable and hospita
ble planets around many sta's,
the fraction of those that will
now be supporting life is negligi
ble.
"Whereas, if we can solve
these problems, and if we can
learn how to survive and pre
serve our planet not just anoth
er millenium, but in fact a

billion years or more, and if
that's typical of civilizations
everywhere, then the interstellar
communication problem itself
becomes very easy, because
there will be life scattered very,
very densely throughout the
universe, and our nearest neigh
bors will be quite close to us.
"So you see, in a way,
studying the problem of inter
stellar communication once
again brings home to us the
necessity of surviving as a
species, in order that someday
we might participate in contact
with other cultures who have
also solved that same problem.
It's just another reason.
"I guess what I'm talking
about is 'after ecology, what?'"
Is anybody there?
Or are we all alone in a big,
empty universe?
The idea that man lies at the
center of creation, condemned
to universal loneliness, is slowly
becoming passe. It is the convic
tion of most scientists that
intelligent life exists on other
planets. What it would take to
find that life, in the way of
equipment, time, money, and
social commitment, is the sub
ject of a summer study at
NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View.
