# Letter From The Reviewing Committee

### 
Following is the text of a July 2 letter from the Reviewing
Committee in the grievance of John J. Dolly to Provost Wil
liam F. Miller concerning procedures to be followed in the
hearing. Members of the Reviewing Committee are Harry A.
Miller, business manager of the cardiology division at the
Medical Center; Roland A. Finston, senior health physicist;
and Assistant Pro], H. Keith //. Brodie of the Department of
Psychiatrv, chairman.
We have considered carefully the verbal response which we
received from you, Robert Rosenzweig, John Schwartz, and
Robert Nelson to our Interim Report dated June 29. Follow
ing that meeting on June 30, we communicated to John Dolly
the likely rejection of our interim recommendations: (1) that
his termination be suspended until completion of his grievance
hearing; and (2) that his grievance hearing not be held until a
verdict is reached in the court case now pending. Notwith
standing this likely rejection, Mr. Dolly has chosen to proceed
promptly with the hearing. The hearing is scheduled to begin
on July 1 2 and it is our intention to continue the sessions on a
daily basis until completion of the hearings. We recognize the
urgency in this matter, both to the University and to Mr.
Dolly.
While we have some residual concerns as to whether Mr.
Dolly and the University feel entirely free to bring before us
all the facts necessary to arrive at a solution that achieves
justice, nonetheless we will do our best to protect the con
fidentiality of the testimony presented by both parties via
refraining from taking verbatim notes, sound recordings, and
issuing statements to the news media. By these means, as well
as by a semi-private hearing format, we hope to maintain a
spirit of mutual confidence and trust in the matter among all
participants. It is our expectation that the hearing would be
completed prior to the end of July.
During the conduct of the hearing, Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Dolly will have a right to be present at all sessions. We
tentatively plan to conduct sessions from 3-5 p.m.
Although we find it difficult to carry forth a fair and just
hearing under a circumstance in which Mr. Dolly because of
his termination is compromised in his ability to meet his basic
needs and responsibilities, we will proceed with the hearing.
