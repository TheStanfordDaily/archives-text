# Response From Robert Nelson

### 
Following is the text of a July 6 statement to the Review
ing Committee concerning procedures from Robert M. Nelson,
director of personnel and employee relations:
The memorandum of the committee to Frovost W. F.
Miller, dated July 2, 1971, which commented upon the pro
cedural questions raised in connection with the review of the
grievance of Mr. Dolly, has been passed to me for reply.
It was my understanding from the meeting on June 30,
1971, that the recommendations encompassed in the Interim
Report of June 29, 1971, were withdrawn with the unanimous
consent of the reviewing committee, and that a reply to this
Interim Report was neither requested nor provided. This
Interim Report was based on a partial gathering of information
from the grievant only, and in addition, its suggestions fell
outside the committee's charge. Consequently, the commit
tee's decision to withdraw its recommendations was entirely
appropriate.
It became apparent to me from some of the questions
presented by your committee that procedural guidance would
be helpful to you and any future grievance committee. A
statement of procedures for the guidance of reviewing officers
and committees is attached.
The committee has expressed its concern about carrying
forth a fair and just hearing. It is, of course, the prime
responsibility of the committee to be as uncommitted and
objective as possible in order to ascertain the merits of the
grievance. It is the charge to the committee as stated in my
memo of June 28, "to determine whether or not Mr. Dolly
was dismissed by the University without appropriate cause,
including whether the University gave him adequate oppor
tunity to defend himself. That is (lie only matter before the
committee." It is to this charge that the findings and recom
mendations of the Final Report should be directed.
I am pleased to note that the committee has established a
schedule to move promptly to gather relevant facts and in
formation on the grievance presented by Mr. Dolly. As you
have said, it is important to both the University and Mr. Dolly
to have this grievance reviewed and resolved at an early date.
I am available to the committee if I may be of further
assistance in resolving questions of procedure.
