police. Arresting officer, Dennis

identified the plant as marijuana.
The Hastings arrived home
later that afternoon to find their
house 1 severely burned and Of
ficer Kruse with a warrant for

sons were arrested on the Stan
ford campus in a drug raid by

cotics Bureau. The raid took
place at 618 Mirada Ave. at the
house of Dr. Peter Paret, cur
rently vacationing in Europe.
'Die police found Robert Rupp,
18, Babert. Krieger, 22, and his
wife, Carolyn, 1 8 , for possession
of five pounds of marijuana, a
quantity of hashish, LSD and
other unidentified drugs. The
three arrested were living at the
Mirada address with Parot's
permission, to care for the house
in his absence.

The policy of the month old
bureau vis-a-vis Stanford, the
Stanford Police Dept. and the
old "Hands off' policy regarding
the Stanford Campus, according
to Sgt. Don Tammof the S.C.C.
Sheriffs Office, is that, "the
S.C.C. Sheriffs Office has juris
diction over Stanford, being an
unincorporated area of the
county, and will not be over
looked. Stanford police are se
curity police and not licensed
peace officers and cannot per
form all police functions, there
fore they are not involved in
this."
"The new bureau is not
concentrating on Stanford,"
Tamm added. "It was merely
coincidental that the first raid
happened to be on the Stanford
campus."
