# AAUP Election Invalidated
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A recent election of the
Stanford chapter of the Ameri
can Association of University
Professors (AAUP) was quietly
ruled invalid this summer, the
Daily has learned.
The election, in which the
main issue was the suspension of
Associate Professor H. Bruce
Franklin, drew considerable in
terest when the nominations
selected by an AAUP committee

were challenged as "unrepresen
tative" and a write-in campaign
was organized by an ad-hoc
group calling itself the Commit
tee For A Balanced AAUP
(CFBA). Another election will
be held in the Fall when new
nominations and a "more for
mal" procedure will be institut
ed.
The decision to invalidate the
election, which was held the first
two weeks of June, was made
before the ballots were counted
when one of the write-in candi
dates, Professor of Chinese
David Nivison wrote the AAUP
executive committee a letter in
which he challenged "irregulari
ties" in the election procedure.
The irregularity cited by
AAUP Acting President Edwin
Parker was "that the national
by-laws require that officers be
elected from the active mem
bers, and several of those nomi
nated were not members at the
time of the election."
Parker noted that thus had
also been the case in his own
election last year, "but nobody
challenged that election."
His decision, however, has
been challenged by one member
of the AAUP nominating com
mittee, Prof. Bernard Roth, who
said, "I question the ethics of a
board throwing out an election
which is run on exactly the same
basis which elected them."
Roth further alleges that the
challenge to the election, and
the subsequent decision, were
made for political reasons by
people who thought pro-Frank
lin nominees would be elected.

This, however, is denied by
Parker and by Nivison, who says,
his challenge was made, "be
cause I didn't think the election
was legal."
During the election the
(CFBA) group, which included
Law school Prof. John Kaplan
and Nobel Laureate Joshua Led
erberg, sent a letter to all
members of the AAUP which
said, "It is significant that five of
the eight persons on your
printed ballot were among the
approximately 7 percent of the
faculty signing the petition to
President Lyman in favor of
lifting the suspension of Bruce
Franklin. We believe that the
need of the AAUP this year is
for people who have not already
declared themselves on this dif
ficult and trying issue."
Roth, however, charges that
the letter, "was at best an unfair
statement, and certainly terribly
dishonest. To assert that the
members they had put up have
not expressed their opinions is
just blatently untrue."
He asserts that the election
was definitely along "left-right"
lines, with the slate supported
by the CFBA weighted heavily
against Franklin.
Roth also challenges the
AAUP resembles "a company
union" in their support of
administration positions. "I feel
they've been very unresponsive
to the types of principles I think
the AAUP should embody."
At Roth's urging, and after a
request from Franklin, the
AAUP has begun looking into
the Franklin suspension.

FLYING FISH PATROLâ€”A posse of sheriff's deputies kept a close
watch on Felt Lake Sunday afternoon. Rumor had it that a swarm
of varmints would try to liberate the water. The lawmen came
equipped with a helicopter, five prowl cars, and two-days supply of
eats. The demonstrators, all forty of them, came with firecrackers.
In the end truth and justice prevailed, the demonstrators lit their
firecrackers, the possee headed off into the sunset, and Felt Lake
was left to the cows. Pacem in teris.
