# Lockheed Corporation—Not Worth Saving
## 
### bill evers 
Lockheed Missiles and Space
Company is the largest employer
in Santa Clara County. So it is
not surprising that automobiles
in the Palo Alto area have
sprouted signs reading "Lock
heed is worth saving." The
parent company, Lockheed Air
craft Corporation, faces bank
rupcy unless it can obtain $250
million by August 8.
On May 6, Secretary of the
Treasury John Connally consult
ed with President Nixon on the
Lockheed case and then an
nounced that the Administration
would support a federal guaran
tee of a $250 million bank loan
to Lockheed. Connally contend
ed: "The health of our aircraft
industry is essentially to the
nation's commerce, employ
ment, technological develop
ment, and protection."
Subsequently, the strength of
anti-war forces in the Senate has
made the prospects of the
original Lockheed aid plan dim
indeed. Lockheed supporters
then seized upon Federal Re
serve Chairman Arthur F. Burns'
suggestion, testifying before the
Senate Committee on Banking
on June 16, that the national
government guarantee loans (up
to a total of $2 billion) to big
businesses (not just to Lock
heed) in emergencies.
In his statement Burns said:
"Assistance should be reserved
for those rare instances where it
is needed to enable a sound
enterprise to continue to furnish
goods or services to the public,
and where failure to meet that
need could have serious con
sequences for the Nation's out
put, employment, and finances."
In analyzing these events we
must differentiate between the
Lockheed plan and the Burns
plans. Lockheed is essentially an
armory or arsenal of the U.S.
government. True, the opera
tions have been farmed out, in
much the same way European
monarchs used to farm out the
job of collecting taxes. As John
Kenneth Galbraith has written:
"That we should pretend that
the big specialized military con
tractors, those that do all or the
bulk of their business with the

Pentagon, much of it as the only
source of supply, are really
private firms—a stalwart manifes
tation of private enterprise
seems to me a unique bit of
nonsense. There would be many
advantages recognizing the
reality, which is that they are
public extensions of the Penta
gon."
A decision as to whether to
maintain an armory like Lock
heed must depend on its effi
ciency. Lockheed has been very
efficient at gobbling tax money.
May I suggest a re-reading of A.
Ernest Fitzgerald's Congressional
testimony in November 1968
about the $2 billion cost in
crease in the C-5A cargo plane
built by Lockheed. These wasted
billions ought never to have been
confiscated from American citi
zens.
Lockheed employees recently
purchased full-page ads in the
Washington Post and the Wash
ington Star supporting a loan
guarantee by the government.
The ad said: "To us it could be a
matter of work or welfare." This
plea, however, sets up a false
dichotomy; in the Lockheed
case the workers are now and
wish to continue to remain, in
an important sense, "on relief."
They have been eating quite
fancily at the tax trough for
years.
There is no difference in
principle between the income of
the Lockheed employees and the
income of a welfare-recipient or
the guaranteed income advocat
ed by the National Welfare
Rights Organization. In fiscal
year 1969, 88 percent of Lock
heed's sales were to the govern
ment.
(A federal loan guarantee is
not a direct gift of taxpayers'
money, while a federal guaran
teed income is. The loan guaran
tee, in the words of economist
Alan Greenspan, "moves one
borrower up in the credit rating
queue at the expense of other
borrowers who are not fortunate
enough to have such a guaran
tee." In other words, instead of
loan money going naturally to
sound firms it will go to the
government's favorites, with the

taxpayer footing the bill if these
favored darlings fall on their
faces again.)
The Burns plan for an Emer
gency Loan Guarantee Board
recalled to many observers the
Reconstruction Finance Corpor
ation created by President Her
bert Hoover. Senate Banking
Chairman John Sparkman (D-
Ala.) has predicted that his
committee will soon write up a
prescription for aiding corpora
tions in trouble that would be
more general than the Lockheed
plan. On July 2, the San

Francisco Examiner spoke favor
ably of "a program of help in
the RFC pattern" designed to
"pull a useful, teetering business
back from the brink."
In the July-August 1966 issue
of "Studies on the Left," Mur
ray N. Rothbard described the
RFC of the Hoover, Roosevelt,
and Truman administrations as
"a method for the American
citizenry to subsidize the bailing
out of shaky banks, especially
those that held the bonds of
bankrupt railroads. One of the
main enthusiasts of the latter

policy was the originator and
chairman of the RFC, Eugene
Meyer, Jr., a protege of Bernard
Baruch. Meyer also just happen
ed to be the brother-in-law of a
partner in J.P. Morgan and Co.,
one of the main beneficiaries of
RFC largesse."
Similarly in the Lockheed
case, the loan guarantee will, as
House Banking Chairman Wright
Patman (D-Tex.) has correctly
surmised, serve to bail out the
twenty-four banks who have
