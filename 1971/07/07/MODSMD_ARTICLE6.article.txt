# Rehire The Five Plus One!

### 
An open letter to Robert Nelson
and Provost Miller:
We the undersigned members
of the United Stanford Employ
ees Black Caucus feel compelled
to protest your discriminatory
attack upon the five employees,
namely: Anthony Chatmon,
John Kielch, Devera Satisky,
Barbara Mooney and John Dol
ly-
The firing of these people was
obviously racist in nature. Each
was deeply involved in worker
struggles (most specifically the
Medical Center sit-in) over the
past year, and you, Robert
Nelson, cited this involvement
(in Medical Center activity) as a
reason for dismissing them.
The hospital sit-in was a
peaceful response to the racist
firing of a Black man (namely
Sam Bridges). It was answered in
{. thoroughly dishonest and rac
ist way—with police, mace and
clubs! Once again we find
ourselves victims of your hypo
crisy.

You laughed at and condemn
ed Lestor Maddox for the
violence he and fellow whites
perpetrated on Blacks for sitting
in his restaurant. Yet, when you
have the opportunity to demon
strate your reaction to a similar
situation you respond by resort
ing to a more "acceptable" form
of violence. Instead of using ax
handles and baseball bats, you
employ police who are already
equipped with riot parapher
nalia. Frankly, we fail to see the
difference.
The firing of these five
employees, and another Black
man, all of whom were active in
organizing workers on campus,
particularly Black and Brown
people, is a painfully obvious
and likewise racist effort to
destroy the workers' movement
here at Stanford.
On the broadest scope politi
cal firings go against the First
Amendment of the Bill of
Rights. That amendment states
as you (as scholars) ought to

know that "Congress shall make
no law .. . abridging the free
dom of speech ... or the right
of the people peaceably to
assemble and to petition the
government for a redress of
grievances." If Congress has no
right to abridge a person's
freedom of expression, then
what right have you? You are
not equal to the law of this
land—being only a small seg
ment—and yet you choose to go
beyond it!
Worker's Rights
These firings bring up the
question, the very essential and
basic question: Do workers have
rights? If you have the power of
God over the livelihoods—and
lives, relatedly—of Stanford
workers, if we have no redress
(with you, William Miller as the
ultimate judge of grievances)
then how can we as workers be
assured of anything resembling
justice? We may be fired on any
whim the administration
chooses. Granted you don't
always display your powers, but
in matters where workers' rights
ought to be of the utmost
concern (i.e., the expression of
our political attitudes, expres
sion of concern over the position
of our fellow workers, and in
conjunction, ourselves) you care
fully stamp out any open oppo
sition to your unjust and in
equitable policies.
Nevertheless, we are not to be
intimidated by these racist ac
tions. We intend to continue
fighting racism, political firings
and management exploitation.
We intend to have our six
brothers and sisters beside us.
REHIRE THE FIVE PLUS ONE
NOW!

ment was signed by IS members
of USE's Black Caucus.)
