## University Travels Primrose Path Again 
### donald stuedeman 
The pervading theme of a
very compelling speech made by
President Lyman before the Fac
ulty Senate on April 15, 1971
was that "The University is a
place of reason, not force"
There is no substitute for reason,
we all agree, and the Senate
thereafter issued an unequivocal
statement to that effect. Right
down the primrose path we
went, again.
The argument used to obtain
this vote of confidence in the
administrative policy, which in
turn was interpreted as support
for the position taken by the
University in the handling of the
Hospital sit-in, was that the
demand for immediate rein
statement of Sam Bridges was
unreasonable.
Faulty Premise
But, let us regress for just a

moment. There was a faulty
premise in the President's argu
ment which could shift the scale
to neutral, if not off to the other
side. This must be pointed out,
if reason is to be the basis of
what follows in the near future.
In his speech, the President
said the breaking point came
when "it became clear that the
sole remaining issue—the imme
diate reinstatement of Sam
Bridges—could not be resolved
and that the sit-in was to
continue, that they decided to
call the police."
However, the statement sent
to the sit-iners by Provost Miller
said, "There will be no conclu
sion to the composition or dates
of the grievance procedure while
the occupation of the Hospital
continues." It should become
abundantly clear at this point

that there is a tremendous
difference between "immediate
reinstatement" and a "greivance
procedure".
Immediate reinstatement im
plies that a sit-in could force the
University to submit to coercive
tactics, which would obviously
be unreasonable. On the other
hand, it would not be coercive
to ask for composition and dates
for a grievance procedure as a
condition for leaving.
'Antithetical'
These two statements are
different to the point of being
antithetical! Yet, "immediate re
instatement" was the grounds
upon which the plea for a place
of reason was fought, and the
winning of this battle is the
thrust for the firing of five
employees.

We should also recognize that
Mr. Nelson, Director of Person
nel, claims that the fact that
these five were arrested during
the sit-in, had nothing to do
with their firing.
At this juncture in time even
a tripartite committee at the
highest level of the grievance
procedure is being rebuffed by
the Provost as this committee
tries for a reasonable solution to
the John Dolly firing.
A misunderstanding on the
part of a great many people has
led to the punishment of the
very few, and perhaps even the
wrong people. If the University
is a place of reason:
1. Has the President failed to
take notice of the fact that the
University's action subsequent*
to the sit-in appears to be based
on a condition that did not
exist?
2. Is it reasonable to fire five
lower echelon employees for

being present at the $100,000
holocaust initiated by the Uni
versity through an action involv
ing questionable judgment?
3. Is it too late to pass the
mea culpas and reajust before
the whole place goes up in
smoke?
If the University is a place of
reason, should not that reason
be universally applies?

If the University is a place of
reason, should not that reason
be universally applies?
(Donald Stuedeman is a mem
ber of the Genetics Department;
seven other members of that
department also signed this
statement.)
The pervading theme of a
very compelling speech made by
President Lyman before the Fac
ulty Senate on April 15, 1971
was that "The University is a
place of reason, not force"
There is no substitute for reason,
we all agree, and the Senate
thereafter issued an unequivocal
statement to that effect. Right
down the primrose path we
went, again.
The argument used to obtain
this vote of confidence in the
administrative policy, which in
turn was interpreted as support
for the position taken by the
University in the handling of the
Hospital sit-in, was that the
demand for immediate rein
statement of Sam Bridges was
unreasonable.
Faulty Premise
But, let us regress for just a

moment. There was a faulty
premise in the President's argu
ment which could shift the scale
to neutral, if not off to the other
side. This must be pointed out,
if reason is to be the basis of
what follows in the near future.
In his speech, the President
said the breaking point came
when "it became clear that the
sole remaining issue—the imme
diate reinstatement of Sam
Bridges—could not be resolved
and that the sit-in was to
continue, that they decided to
call the police."
However, the statement sent
to the sit-iners by Provost Miller
said, "There will be no conclu
sion to the composition or dates
of the grievance procedure while
the occupation of the Hospital
continues." It should become
abundantly clear at this point

that there is a tremendous
difference between "immediate
reinstatement" and a "greivance
procedure".
Immediate reinstatement im
plies that a sit-in could force the
University to submit to coercive
tactics, which would obviously
be unreasonable. On the other
hand, it would not be coercive
to ask for composition and dates
for a grievance procedure as a
condition for leaving.
'Antithetical'
These two statements are
different to the point of being
antithetical! Yet, "immediate re
instatement" was the grounds
upon which the plea for a place
of reason was fought, and the
winning of this battle is the
thrust for the firing of five
employees.

We should also recognize that
Mr. Nelson, Director of Person
nel, claims that the fact that
these five were arrested during
the sit-in, had nothing to do
with their firing.
At this juncture in time even
a tripartite committee at the
highest level of the grievance
procedure is being rebuffed by
the Provost as this committee
tries for a reasonable solution to
the John Dolly firing.
A misunderstanding on the
part of a great many people has
led to the punishment of the
very few, and perhaps even the
wrong people. If the University
is a place of reason:
1. Has the President failed to
take notice of the fact that the
University's action subsequent*
to the sit-in appears to be based
on a condition that did not
exist?
2. Is it reasonable to fire five
lower echelon employees for

being present at the $100,000
holocaust initiated by the Uni
versity through an action involv
ing questionable judgment?
3. Is it too late to pass the
mea culpas and reajust before
the whole place goes up in
smoke?
If the University is a place of
reason, should not that reason
be universally applies?
