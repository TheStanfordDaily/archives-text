# Fillmore Is No More
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Fillmore West has closed, but
it went out in style. Bill
Graham's music palace, which
along with its sister hall in New
York City, has been for the past
few years the center of live, rock
music world, is no longer.
But the old Carousel Ball
room at Van Ness and Market
streets didn't close its doors
until some of the finest rock
musicians had filled its stage for
a final week of super-music.
A week ago Sunday, Graham
had closed out fillmore East
with a private party featuring
John Lennon, the Beachbory,
Albert King and others. And
although his other ballroom had
also been scheduled to close that
night, he decided to grant it a
one week reprieve.
It was quite a week. Almost
every group which had had a
part in making what became
"the San Francisco sound" turn
ed up for a final gig. And those
lucky enough to get tickets,
loved it.
Five nights were loaded with

talent. Almost every local super
group was there. A few weren't.
Janis was gone but she was
remembered. Between sets on
Sunday night Graham played
tracks of her music in a poignant
tribute. And Grace Slick has
been having some physical prob
lems, but two members of the
old Airplane, Jack Casady and
Jorma Kackonen appeared with
Hot Tuna on Saturday night and
some people thought they top
ped the bill.
All The Biggies
All the truly great local
groups which had been around
awhile, like Quicksilver, Elvin
Bishop, The Sons of Champlin
(now Yogi Phlegm) and of
course the kings, the Grateful
Dead, were there. And some of
the more recent groups which
have filled some of the void left
by those gone by played. Groups
like Grootna, Boz Scaggs and
Clod Blood.
Everyting led up to an appro
priate final show on the 4th of
July. The counterculture cele
brated its own kind of partiotism

as they worshipped Tower of
Power, Santana and the big
surprise, Creedence Clearwater
Revival.
The music was fantastic and
it went on for long hours.
During breaks Graham paid
thanks to all his employees and
they in turn presented him with
a giant chocolate cake. He even
got a surprisingly enthusiastic
show of thanks from the giant
audience which was almost com
pletely devoid of the boos and
catcalls he had often gotten
from many people.
The Fillmore West is sched
uled to be torn down for a
Howard Johnson's motel, but
this has apparently again been
postponned for another year.
Sunday night, Graham admitted
that other people might put on
shows there in the future.
Other Shows
Graham will continue to put
on shows elswhere on a less
regular basis. This month he has
shows set for the Berkeley
Community Theater with Lee
Michaels, Emerson, Lake & Pal
mer, Procul Harum and Faces.
He may also put on some shows
at Winterland if the police don't
revoke his permit first.
Some of those shows will be
good. The Dead and Santana
shows at Winterland recently

were both good and enjoyable.
But it won't be the same.
One will always remember
fondly some of those great
nights at Fillmore which will
never be forgotten. The nights
Santana and the Airplane and
the Dead played as talented, new
"local groups". And then there
was the first time Sha-Na-Na
appeared back in 1969 and
knocked the audience off its ass.
And most recently there was the
night the place came down when
Aretha Franklin brought out
Ray Charles for her encore.

But there are bad memories
too. All the poor, forgotten kids
who would walk around end
lessly in drug stupors. And all
the rotten groups which Graham
was forced to take with the
heavier ones. And the naive
audience which still loved even
the most untalented people.
Graham's Problems
It just became too much of a
drag for Graham. He was sick of
the over-priced groups who had
forgotten all the favors he had
done for them. He was sick of
the audiences who would cheer
any amount of poor music. He
was sick of the drug abuse and
the hassels. He could only take
so much and after six years he
wants out.
This last week, a lot of these
problems which had been plaug
ing Fillmore in recent years and
which were instrumental in
Graham's decision to close, were
reportedly missing. Graham even
felt it."The supposed rock
community existed this week.
The FM stations co-operated to
brodcast the final nights and all
the groups were quite coopera
tive.
"There was a wonderful,
warm spirit. Somehow it seemed
like a birth, not a death. If the
future could be like this, San
Francisco has a beautiful future
ahead of it. Rock is here to
stay."
Now What?
But how will it stay. The
ballrooms are gone, maybe for
good. Avalon, Longshoreman's,
Carousel and now F'illmore are
all dark. Some ambitious pro
moter might try to start them up
again some day. In the mean
while, Graham will put on some
shows and others will do the
same in the big auditoriums.
The rock clubs which have
been popping up all over may be
the next phase. Most of them are
small, comfortable and nice and
now smaller groups will have a
greater chance to be discovered
in them with more attention
focused on them. A few of the
big local groups may play them,
but by size alone, they'll never
be feasible for most big groups.
Rock will not die. But Bill
Graham's ballroom which
spawned so many of the groups
from local roots into national
prominence, has died. The rock
music world will miss it. As one
of the very few superstars who
never played there said, "All
things must pass."

also been scheduled to close that
night, he decided to grant it a
one week reprieve.
It was quite a week. Almost
every group which had had a
part in making what became
"the San Francisco sound" turn
ed up for a final gig. And those
lucky enough to get tickets,
loved it.
Five nights were loaded with

talent. Almost every local super
group was there. A few weren't.
Janis was gone but she was
remembered. Between sets on
Sunday night Graham played
tracks of her music in a poignant
tribute. And Grace Slick has
been having some physical prob
lems, but two members of the
old Airplane, Jack Casady and
Jorma Kackonen appeared with
Hot Tuna on Saturday night and
some people thought they top
ped the bill.
All The Biggies
All the truly great local
groups which had been around
awhile, like Quicksilver, Elvin
Bishop, The Sons of Champlin
(now Yogi Phlegm) and of
course the kings, the Grateful
Dead, were there. And some of
the more recent groups which
have filled some of the void left
by those gone by played. Groups
like Grootna, Boz Scaggs and
Clod Blood.
Everyting led up to an appro
priate final show on the 4th of
July. The counterculture cele
brated its own kind of partiotism

as they worshipped Tower of
Power, Santana and the big
surprise, Creedence Clearwater
Revival.
The music was fantastic and
it went on for long hours.
During breaks Graham paid
thanks to all his employees and
they in turn presented him with
a giant chocolate cake. He even
got a surprisingly enthusiastic
show of thanks from the giant
audience which was almost com
pletely devoid of the boos and
catcalls he had often gotten
from many people.
The Fillmore West is sched
uled to be torn down for a
Howard Johnson's motel, but
this has apparently again been
postponned for another year.
Sunday night, Graham admitted
that other people might put on
shows there in the future.
Other Shows
Graham will continue to put
on shows elswhere on a less
regular basis. This month he has
shows set for the Berkeley
Community Theater with Lee
Michaels, Emerson, Lake & Pal
mer, Procul Harum and Faces.
He may also put on some shows
at Winterland if the police don't
revoke his permit first.
Some of those shows will be
good. The Dead and Santana
shows at Winterland recently

were both good and enjoyable.
But it won't be the same.
One will always remember
fondly some of those great
nights at Fillmore which will
never be forgotten. The nights
Santana and the Airplane and
the Dead played as talented, new
"local groups". And then there
was the first time Sha-Na-Na
appeared back in 1969 and
knocked the audience off its ass.
And most recently there was the
night the place came down when
Aretha Franklin brought out
Ray Charles for her encore.

But there are bad memories
too. All the poor, forgotten kids
who would walk around end
lessly in drug stupors. And all
the rotten groups which Graham
was forced to take with the
heavier ones. And the naive
audience which still loved even
the most untalented people.
Graham's Problems
It just became too much of a
drag for Graham. He was sick of
the over-priced groups who had
forgotten all the favors he had
done for them. He was sick of
the audiences who would cheer
any amount of poor music. He
was sick of the drug abuse and
the hassels. He could only take
so much and after six years he
wants out.
This last week, a lot of these
problems which had been plaug
ing Fillmore in recent years and
which were instrumental in
Graham's decision to close, were
reportedly missing. Graham even
felt it."The supposed rock
community existed this week.
The FM stations co-operated to
brodcast the final nights and all
the groups were quite coopera
tive.
"There was a wonderful,
warm spirit. Somehow it seemed
like a birth, not a death. If the
future could be like this, San
Francisco has a beautiful future
ahead of it. Rock is here to
stay."
Now What?
But how will it stay. The
ballrooms are gone, maybe for
good. Avalon, Longshoreman's,
Carousel and now F'illmore are
all dark. Some ambitious pro
moter might try to start them up
again some day. In the mean
while, Graham will put on some
shows and others will do the
same in the big auditoriums.
The rock clubs which have
been popping up all over may be
the next phase. Most of them are
small, comfortable and nice and
now smaller groups will have a
greater chance to be discovered
in them with more attention
focused on them. A few of the
big local groups may play them,
but by size alone, they'll never
be feasible for most big groups.
Rock will not die. But Bill
Graham's ballroom which
spawned so many of the groups
from local roots into national
prominence, has died. The rock
music world will miss it. As one
of the very few superstars who
never played there said, "All
things must pass."

old Airplane, Jack Casady and
Jorma Kackonen appeared with
Hot Tuna on Saturday night and
some people thought they top
ped the bill.
All The Biggies
All the truly great local
groups which had been around
awhile, like Quicksilver, Elvin
Bishop, The Sons of Champlin
(now Yogi Phlegm) and of
course the kings, the Grateful
Dead, were there. And some of
the more recent groups which
have filled some of the void left
by those gone by played. Groups
like Grootna, Boz Scaggs and
Clod Blood.
Everyting led up to an appro
priate final show on the 4th of
July. The counterculture cele
brated its own kind of partiotism

as they worshipped Tower of
Power, Santana and the big
surprise, Creedence Clearwater
Revival.
The music was fantastic and
it went on for long hours.
During breaks Graham paid
thanks to all his employees and
they in turn presented him with
a giant chocolate cake. He even
got a surprisingly enthusiastic
show of thanks from the giant
audience which was almost com
pletely devoid of the boos and
catcalls he had often gotten
from many people.
The Fillmore West is sched
uled to be torn down for a
Howard Johnson's motel, but
this has apparently again been
postponned for another year.
Sunday night, Graham admitted
that other people might put on
shows there in the future.
Other Shows
Graham will continue to put
on shows elswhere on a less
regular basis. This month he has
shows set for the Berkeley
Community Theater with Lee
Michaels, Emerson, Lake & Pal
mer, Procul Harum and Faces.
He may also put on some shows
at Winterland if the police don't
revoke his permit first.
Some of those shows will be
good. The Dead and Santana
shows at Winterland recently

were both good and enjoyable.
But it won't be the same.
One will always remember
fondly some of those great
nights at Fillmore which will
never be forgotten. The nights
Santana and the Airplane and
the Dead played as talented, new
"local groups". And then there
was the first time Sha-Na-Na
appeared back in 1969 and
knocked the audience off its ass.
And most recently there was the
night the place came down when
Aretha Franklin brought out
Ray Charles for her encore.

But there are bad memories
too. All the poor, forgotten kids
who would walk around end
lessly in drug stupors. And all
the rotten groups which Graham
was forced to take with the
heavier ones. And the naive
audience which still loved even
the most untalented people.
Graham's Problems
It just became too much of a
drag for Graham. He was sick of
the over-priced groups who had
forgotten all the favors he had
done for them. He was sick of
the audiences who would cheer
any amount of poor music. He
was sick of the drug abuse and
the hassels. He could only take
so much and after six years he
wants out.
This last week, a lot of these
problems which had been plaug
ing Fillmore in recent years and
which were instrumental in
Graham's decision to close, were
reportedly missing. Graham even
felt it."The supposed rock
community existed this week.
The FM stations co-operated to
brodcast the final nights and all
the groups were quite coopera
tive.
"There was a wonderful,
warm spirit. Somehow it seemed
like a birth, not a death. If the
future could be like this, San
Francisco has a beautiful future
ahead of it. Rock is here to
stay."
Now What?
But how will it stay. The
ballrooms are gone, maybe for
good. Avalon, Longshoreman's,
Carousel and now F'illmore are
all dark. Some ambitious pro
moter might try to start them up
again some day. In the mean
while, Graham will put on some
shows and others will do the
same in the big auditoriums.
The rock clubs which have
been popping up all over may be
the next phase. Most of them are
small, comfortable and nice and
now smaller groups will have a
greater chance to be discovered
in them with more attention
focused on them. A few of the
big local groups may play them,
but by size alone, they'll never
be feasible for most big groups.
Rock will not die. But Bill
Graham's ballroom which
spawned so many of the groups
from local roots into national
prominence, has died. The rock
music world will miss it. As one
of the very few superstars who
never played there said, "All
things must pass."

WHAT NOW?â€”Elvin Bishop is one of the many longtime Fillmore
favorites who will no longer be able to play there. Bill Graham's
premier rock showcase closed down last Sunday after a week filled
with some of the best music ever heard there.
Fillmore West has closed, but
it went out in style. Bill
Graham's music palace, which
along with its sister hall in New
York City, has been for the past
few years the center of live, rock
music world, is no longer.
But the old Carousel Ball
room at Van Ness and Market
streets didn't close its doors
until some of the finest rock
musicians had filled its stage for
a final week of super-music.
A week ago Sunday, Graham
had closed out fillmore East
with a private party featuring
John Lennon, the Beachbory,
Albert King and others. And
although his other ballroom had
also been scheduled to close that
night, he decided to grant it a
one week reprieve.
It was quite a week. Almost
every group which had had a
part in making what became
"the San Francisco sound" turn
ed up for a final gig. And those
lucky enough to get tickets,
loved it.
Five nights were loaded with

talent. Almost every local super
group was there. A few weren't.
Janis was gone but she was
remembered. Between sets on
Sunday night Graham played
tracks of her music in a poignant
tribute. And Grace Slick has
been having some physical prob
lems, but two members of the
old Airplane, Jack Casady and
Jorma Kackonen appeared with
Hot Tuna on Saturday night and
some people thought they top
ped the bill.
