PASSPORT PHOTOS
The summer edition of the
Daily Passport Service is taking
passports every weekday, from 3
p.m. to 5 p.m. If you're going
overseas, or just need some
wallet photos, drop in. Our
service is the least expensive on
campus—6 photos for $2.50. For
each additional set of 3 after
that, only a buck. Regardless of
any special instructions on bor
ders or sizes, our price remains
the same. Overnight service, if
necessary, is also available.
We also have a poster service
available. Your passport photo,
or any photo or negative you
bring in, will be blown up to 24"
x 36" for a fee of $5.00. The
Storke Publications Building is
on Lomita Drive and Panama.
Just walk through the Daily
front door, make a right until
you hit the candy machine.
Then face right and walk right
in.
