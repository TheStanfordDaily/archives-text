### BOB LITTERMAN 
A series of correspondences
released yesterday by the execu

chapter of the American Asso

(AAUP) show that it is "trou

Provost Miller are reprinted on
page 2.)

suspension." Further it stated,

is that the suspension must be
justified on the ground that

duties somehow threatens im
mediate harm to others."
Lyman's reply noted that
Franklin had been suspended
under Paragraph 17 of the
Statement of Policy on Appoint
