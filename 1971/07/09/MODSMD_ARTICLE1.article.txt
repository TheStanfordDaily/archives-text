# AAUP Letters Seek Reasons In Suspension
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
A series of correspondences
released yesterday by the execu
tive committee of the Stanford
chapter of the American Asso
ciation of University Professors
(AAUP) show that it is "trou
bled" by justifications cited by
President Lyman in suspending
Associate Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
Franklin was suspended Feb
ruary 12 for having "urged,
incited and led Stanford stud
ents and others to interfere with
the operations of the University
and conduct themselves in an
unlawful manner," and for hav
ing done so himself.
Franklin presently remains
suspended with pay pending
hearings scheduled September
28 before the faculty Advisory
Board.
The letters include an initial
inquiry by the AAUP, a response
by Lyman, another letter from
the AAUP asking for clarifica
tion, and a response by Provost
Miller in Lyman's absence.
(Lyman's letter, the AAUP re
sponse and a disclaimer from
Provost Miller are reprinted on
page 2.)
In their first letter the AAUP
asked for "in writing a statement
of your reasons for ordering the
suspension." Further it stated,
"Standards of conduct develop
ed by the National AAUP make
clear that temporary suspension
is an extraordinary remedy to be
utilized only when absolutely
essential...
"Your responses (to a faculty
petition), does not answer, with
clarity, the objections that have
been put forth . . . The problem
is that the suspension must be
justified on the ground that
continuation now of his regular
duties somehow threatens im
mediate harm to others."
Lyman's reply noted that
Franklin had been suspended
under Paragraph 17 of the
Statement of Policy on Appoint
ment and Tenure at Stanford
University. This paragraph reads:
"Suspension of a faculty mem
ber during proceedings under
Paragraphs 15 or 16 is justified
only if immediate harm to
himself or others is threatened by
his continuance in his regular
duties. Any such suspension
shall be with pay."
Inconsistent
Lyman's letter later states,
"It is my view that the suspen
sion must be justified on the
grounds that continuation of his
regular duties would be incon
sistent with measures taken to
prevent the threat of immediate
harm to others."
The AAUP responded two
weeks ago with a letter stating,
"The Executive Committee of
the Stanford Chapter is troubled
by your response to us of May
sth .. . The fifth paragraph of
that letter, as we understand it,
asserts that the suspension was
necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction;
but it really does not address
itself to whether the criteria set
forth in paragraph 17 of the
Tenure Statement were met.. .
"We now request that you
state more specifically the infor
mation which came to your
attention on which you reached
the judgment that Professor
Franklin's continued presence
on the campus threatened harm
to others."

This letter also noted that the
AAUP had received a request for
assistance from Professor Frank
lin, both at the local and on the
national level.
Provost Miller responded to
this last letter saying he could
not answer for Lyman, but
would bring it to his immediate
attention on his return August
9th.
One of those who urged the
AAUP to look into the suspen
sion, Engineering Design Profes
sor Bernard Roth, said he is
"disappointed with the evasive
nes of the President's response."
Neither, however, is he content
with the AAUP's action in the
matter.
"Last week I met with the
AAUP executive committee at
their invitation and it was
apparent to me that most of the
members are almost completely
uninformed," he said, "and that
one member, Prof. William Bax
ter is over informed. By that I
mean he has a very elaborate and
detailed file on Franklin's activi
ties which smacks of more than

I'm sure that President Lyman
could not have represented the
administration viewpoint more
vehemently than did Prof. Bax
ter."
Further he said, "It took a lot
of prodding to get the slightest
activity out of them on the
question of the validity of the
Franklin suspension. Their ac
tion on the faculty self-discipline
issue was shameful and whenever
one talks with them he quickly
gets the impression that they
perceive their role to be part of
management, to put it in labor
terms.
"I've been asking them to call
a membership meeting to discuss
the important issues before us
and they're refusing to do so.
I've been a member of the
AAUP for nine years, and at this
point I'm so disgusted I'm
thinking of quitting."
Neither AAUP President Jack
Friedenthal, nor Vice-President
Edwin Parker were available for
comment.

Associate Professor H. Bruce
Franklin.
Franklin was suspended Feb
ruary 12 for having "urged,
incited and led Stanford stud
ents and others to interfere with
the operations of the University
and conduct themselves in an
unlawful manner," and for hav
ing done so himself.
Franklin presently remains
suspended with pay pending
hearings scheduled September
28 before the faculty Advisory
Board.
The letters include an initial
inquiry by the AAUP, a response
by Lyman, another letter from
the AAUP asking for clarifica

Miller in Lyman's absence.
(Lyman's letter, the AAUP re
sponse and a disclaimer from
Provost Miller are reprinted on
page 2.)
In their first letter the AAUP
asked for "in writing a statement
of your reasons for ordering the
suspension." Further it stated,
"Standards of conduct develop
ed by the National AAUP make
clear that temporary suspension
is an extraordinary remedy to be
utilized only when absolutely
essential...
"Your responses (to a faculty
petition), does not answer, with
clarity, the objections that have
been put forth . . . The problem
is that the suspension must be
justified on the ground that
continuation now of his regular
duties somehow threatens im
mediate harm to others."
Lyman's reply noted that
Franklin had been suspended
under Paragraph 17 of the
Statement of Policy on Appoint
ment and Tenure at Stanford
University. This paragraph reads:
"Suspension of a faculty mem
ber during proceedings under
Paragraphs 15 or 16 is justified
only if immediate harm to
himself or others is threatened by
his continuance in his regular
duties. Any such suspension
shall be with pay."

Lyman's letter later states,
"It is my view that the suspen
sion must be justified on the
grounds that continuation of his
regular duties would be incon
sistent with measures taken to
prevent the threat of immediate
harm to others."
The AAUP responded two
weeks ago with a letter stating,
"The Executive Committee of
the Stanford Chapter is troubled
by your response to us of May
sth .. . The fifth paragraph of
that letter, as we understand it,
asserts that the suspension was
necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction;
but it really does not address
itself to whether the criteria set
forth in paragraph 17 of the
Tenure Statement were met.. .
"We now request that you
state more specifically the infor
mation which came to your
attention on which you reached
the judgment that Professor
Franklin's continued presence
on the campus threatened harm
to others."

This letter also noted that the
AAUP had received a request for
assistance from Professor Frank
lin, both at the local and on the
national level.
Provost Miller responded to
this last letter saying he could
not answer for Lyman, but
would bring it to his immediate
attention on his return August
9th.
One of those who urged the
AAUP to look into the suspen
sion, Engineering Design Profes
sor Bernard Roth, said he is
"disappointed with the evasive
nes of the President's response."
Neither, however, is he content
with the AAUP's action in the
matter.

Further he said, "It took a lot
of prodding to get the slightest

Franklin suspension. Their ac

issue was shameful and whenever
one talks with them he quickly

"I've been asking them to call

Franklin presently remains
suspended with pay pending
hearings scheduled September
28 before the faculty Advisory
Board.
The letters include an initial
inquiry by the AAUP, a response
by Lyman, another letter from
the AAUP asking for clarifica
tion, and a response by Provost
Miller in Lyman's absence.
(Lyman's letter, the AAUP re
sponse and a disclaimer from
Provost Miller are reprinted on
page 2.)
In their first letter the AAUP
asked for "in writing a statement
of your reasons for ordering the
suspension." Further it stated,
"Standards of conduct develop
ed by the National AAUP make
clear that temporary suspension
is an extraordinary remedy to be
utilized only when absolutely
essential...
"Your responses (to a faculty
petition), does not answer, with
clarity, the objections that have
been put forth . . . The problem
is that the suspension must be
justified on the ground that
continuation now of his regular
duties somehow threatens im
mediate harm to others."
Lyman's reply noted that
Franklin had been suspended
under Paragraph 17 of the
Statement of Policy on Appoint
ment and Tenure at Stanford
University. This paragraph reads:
"Suspension of a faculty mem
ber during proceedings under
Paragraphs 15 or 16 is justified
only if immediate harm to
himself or others is threatened by
his continuance in his regular
duties. Any such suspension
shall be with pay."
Inconsistent
Lyman's letter later states,
"It is my view that the suspen
sion must be justified on the
grounds that continuation of his
regular duties would be incon
sistent with measures taken to
prevent the threat of immediate
harm to others."
The AAUP responded two
weeks ago with a letter stating,
"The Executive Committee of
the Stanford Chapter is troubled
by your response to us of May
sth .. . The fifth paragraph of
that letter, as we understand it,
asserts that the suspension was
necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction;
but it really does not address
itself to whether the criteria set
forth in paragraph 17 of the
Tenure Statement were met.. .
"We now request that you
state more specifically the infor
mation which came to your
attention on which you reached
the judgment that Professor
Franklin's continued presence
on the campus threatened harm
to others."

This letter also noted that the
AAUP had received a request for
assistance from Professor Frank
lin, both at the local and on the
national level.
Provost Miller responded to
this last letter saying he could
not answer for Lyman, but
would bring it to his immediate
attention on his return August
9th.
One of those who urged the
AAUP to look into the suspen
sion, Engineering Design Profes
sor Bernard Roth, said he is
"disappointed with the evasive
nes of the President's response."
Neither, however, is he content
with the AAUP's action in the
matter.
"Last week I met with the
AAUP executive committee at
their invitation and it was
apparent to me that most of the
members are almost completely
uninformed," he said, "and that
one member, Prof. William Bax
ter is over informed. By that I
mean he has a very elaborate and
detailed file on Franklin's activi
ties which smacks of more than

a casual interest in the matter.
I'm sure that President Lyman
could not have represented the
administration viewpoint more
vehemently than did Prof. Bax
ter."
Further he said, "It took a lot
of prodding to get the slightest
activity out of them on the
question of the validity of the
Franklin suspension. Their ac
tion on the faculty self-discipline
issue was shameful and whenever
one talks with them he quickly
gets the impression that they
perceive their role to be part of
management, to put it in labor
terms.
"I've been asking them to call
a membership meeting to discuss
the important issues before us
and they're refusing to do so.
I've been a member of the
AAUP for nine years, and at this
point I'm so disgusted I'm
thinking of quitting."
Neither AAUP President Jack
Friedenthal, nor Vice-President
Edwin Parker were available for
comment.
