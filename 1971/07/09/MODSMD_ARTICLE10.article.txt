# 'The Emergence' Should've Stayed In LA
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Two weeks ago I thought that
"The Beard" would be a sure
winner as the "worst theatrical
material of the summer" seen by
this reviewer. But believe it or
not, another serious contender
for that award has emerged.
The Company Theatre, a
dramatic group from Los Ange
les which was founded in 1967
by a group of students, most of
them dropouts from USC, can
be thanked for making it a two
play race with their production
of "The Emergence."
Before the play begins, mem
bers of the cast pass out bread
and oranges among the audience.
After watching them perform
for two hours, one wonders if
tomatoes wouldn't have been
more useful and appropriate.
Their press release character
izes the production as being "a
psychedelic fairy tale for adults
and a grotesque witch's brew
... A sort of Marx Brothers
meets J.R.R. Tolkien." If I were
any of these people I would try
to remove my name from any
association with "The Emer
gence," as quickly as possible.
Wayward Queen
To describe the "plot" is a bit
difficult, but it goes something
like this. The king of whatever
calls together his court, only to
discover that his queen is gone
with her lover. He immediately
dispatches Sir Lancelot and his
12 Redwing soldiers to search
her out.
In their search of over an
hour, they run up against more
than one wall and finally fall
into a deep pit. Actually the
whole play fell into a deep pit
from the start, but ironically the
show's pit scenes provide its
only real bright moments.
The pit is depicted by a large
square hole which is set perpen
dicular on the stage so that with
the soldiers looling sideways into
it, an optical illusion is created
that makes the audience feel it is
at the bottom of a tunnel.
One of the soldiers spits to
see how deep the pit is and
cleverly, drops of water fall from
the ceiling onto the audience.
Gimmicks in the pursuit of
theater are no vice.
Later when they are using Sir
Lancelot's magic cord to help

them find their way out ot the
pit, all the lights go out and they
grope around the stage and into
part of the audience. Judging
from a few female yelps, they
must hold onto more than the
cord.
While in the pits, the boys
meet a witch who is portrayed
outstandingly by Candace
Laughlin. She does a perfect job
as an evil, cackling, old witch
and gives the only real strong
acting performance of the night.
I am sure that members of
the cast would point to the fact
that the show includes not one,
but two nude scenes, as a sign of
theatrical maturity and sophisti
cation. "If they did it once,
they'll do it again."
The first lovemaking scene
between the queen and her lover
is preceded by verbal foreplay in
some unrecognizable gobbdy
lgook language. They must have
enjoyed their first encounter
immensely for they repeat it
later in the show, this time with
a background of six or eight
gyrating nude bodies.
Up and Down
For variety's sake the second
lovemaking scene is horizontal
instead of vertical. It is also
longer and nosier than the first
for theatergoers who keep track
of such things.
One of the few redeeming

features of "The Beard" was
good acting. One can't say the
same for "The Emergence." The
witch is outstanding and a few
other actors show small flashes
of talent but little more. The
music including a guitar, drums,
cymbals and gongs is unexciting.
The lighting effects are the only
real strong part of the produc
tion, especially near the end
where there are some good light
show-type things and a beautiful
prism effect.
The dialogue in the last
moments is very appropriate.
While the cast holds candles and
smoke envelopes the stage, one
of the actors explains in philo
sophical terms, what must be
part of the "message" of the
show.
He talks about how "The
question is not To Be or Not To
Be, but is To Be or To Be
Forgotten." This doesn't really
explain the show very well but it
is good advice for the audience.
The sooner I can forget "The
Emergence" the better I'll feel.
(Performances of li The Emer
gence" will continue nightly at
8:00 p.m. at the Friends and
Relations, 660 Great Highway in
San Francisco, student tickets
are $2.50 on wee knights and
$3.00 on Friday and Saturday.
General tickets are $1.50 higher.
There is no Monday night
performance.)

DO IT—"The Emergence" which made its San Francisco debut
Wednesday night has not one, but two nude scenes. Seen here in the
first lovemaking scene (above) are the queen and her lover, Squire
Pepin. For those of you who care, the second lovemaking scene
features more bodies and is horizontal instead of vertical. Seen in
more ornamental costumes (below right) are the members of the
Royal Court. If you enjoy dramatic incompetence spiced with
nudity youll be glad to know that the show will continue to be
presented at Friends and Relations through July 25.

more ornamental costumes (below right) are the members of the
Royal Court. If you enjoy dramatic incompetence spiced with
nudity youll be glad to know that the show will continue to be
presented at Friends and Relations through July 25.

Two weeks ago I thought that
"The Beard" would be a sure
winner as the "worst theatrical
material of the summer" seen by
this reviewer. But believe it or
not, another serious contender
for that award has emerged.
The Company Theatre, a
dramatic group from Los Ange
les which was founded in 1967
by a group of students, most of
them dropouts from USC, can
be thanked for making it a two
play race with their production
of "The Emergence."
Before the play begins, mem
bers of the cast pass out bread
and oranges among the audience.
After watching them perform
for two hours, one wonders if
tomatoes wouldn't have been
more useful and appropriate.
Their press release character
izes the production as being "a
psychedelic fairy tale for adults
and a grotesque witch's brew
... A sort of Marx Brothers
meets J.R.R. Tolkien." If I were
any of these people I would try
to remove my name from any
association with "The Emer
gence," as quickly as possible.
Wayward Queen
To describe the "plot" is a bit
difficult, but it goes something
like this. The king of whatever
calls together his court, only to
discover that his queen is gone
with her lover. He immediately
dispatches Sir Lancelot and his
12 Redwing soldiers to search
her out.
In their search of over an
hour, they run up against more
than one wall and finally fall
into a deep pit. Actually the
whole play fell into a deep pit
from the start, but ironically the
show's pit scenes provide its
only real bright moments.
The pit is depicted by a large
square hole which is set perpen
dicular on the stage so that with
the soldiers looling sideways into
it, an optical illusion is created
that makes the audience feel it is
at the bottom of a tunnel.
One of the soldiers spits to
see how deep the pit is and
cleverly, drops of water fall from
the ceiling onto the audience.
Gimmicks in the pursuit of
theater are no vice.
Later when they are using Sir
Lancelot's magic cord to help

them find their way out ot the
pit, all the lights go out and they
grope around the stage and into
part of the audience. Judging
from a few female yelps, they
must hold onto more than the
cord.
While in the pits, the boys
meet a witch who is portrayed
outstandingly by Candace
Laughlin. She does a perfect job
as an evil, cackling, old witch
and gives the only real strong
acting performance of the night.
I am sure that members of
the cast would point to the fact
that the show includes not one,
but two nude scenes, as a sign of
theatrical maturity and sophisti
cation. "If they did it once,
they'll do it again."
The first lovemaking scene
between the queen and her lover
is preceded by verbal foreplay in
some unrecognizable gobbdy
lgook language. They must have
enjoyed their first encounter
immensely for they repeat it
later in the show, this time with
a background of six or eight
gyrating nude bodies.
Up and Down
For variety's sake the second
lovemaking scene is horizontal
instead of vertical. It is also
longer and nosier than the first
for theatergoers who keep track
of such things.
One of the few redeeming

features of "The Beard" was
good acting. One can't say the
same for "The Emergence." The
witch is outstanding and a few
other actors show small flashes
of talent but little more. The
music including a guitar, drums,
cymbals and gongs is unexciting.
The lighting effects are the only
real strong part of the produc
tion, especially near the end
where there are some good light
show-type things and a beautiful
prism effect.
The dialogue in the last
moments is very appropriate.
While the cast holds candles and
smoke envelopes the stage, one
of the actors explains in philo
sophical terms, what must be
part of the "message" of the
show.
He talks about how "The
question is not To Be or Not To
Be, but is To Be or To Be
Forgotten." This doesn't really
explain the show very well but it
is good advice for the audience.
The sooner I can forget "The
Emergence" the better I'll feel.

Wednesday night has not one, but two nude scenes. Seen here in the
first lovemaking scene (above) are the queen and her lover, Squire
Pepin. For those of you who care, the second lovemaking scene
features more bodies and is horizontal instead of vertical. Seen in
more ornamental costumes (below right) are the members of the
Royal Court. If you enjoy dramatic incompetence spiced with
nudity youll be glad to know that the show will continue to be
presented at Friends and Relations through July 25.

Two weeks ago I thought that
"The Beard" would be a sure
winner as the "worst theatrical
material of the summer" seen by
this reviewer. But believe it or
not, another serious contender
for that award has emerged.
The Company Theatre, a
dramatic group from Los Ange
les which was founded in 1967
by a group of students, most of
them dropouts from USC, can
be thanked for making it a two
play race with their production
of "The Emergence."
Before the play begins, mem
bers of the cast pass out bread
and oranges among the audience.
After watching them perform
for two hours, one wonders if
tomatoes wouldn't have been
more useful and appropriate.
Their press release character
izes the production as being "a
psychedelic fairy tale for adults
and a grotesque witch's brew
... A sort of Marx Brothers
meets J.R.R. Tolkien." If I were
any of these people I would try
to remove my name from any
association with "The Emer
gence," as quickly as possible.
Wayward Queen
To describe the "plot" is a bit
difficult, but it goes something
like this. The king of whatever
calls together his court, only to
discover that his queen is gone
with her lover. He immediately
dispatches Sir Lancelot and his
12 Redwing soldiers to search
her out.
In their search of over an
hour, they run up against more
than one wall and finally fall
into a deep pit. Actually the
whole play fell into a deep pit
from the start, but ironically the
show's pit scenes provide its
only real bright moments.
The pit is depicted by a large
square hole which is set perpen
dicular on the stage so that with
the soldiers looling sideways into
it, an optical illusion is created
that makes the audience feel it is
at the bottom of a tunnel.
One of the soldiers spits to
see how deep the pit is and
cleverly, drops of water fall from
the ceiling onto the audience.
Gimmicks in the pursuit of
theater are no vice.
Later when they are using Sir
Lancelot's magic cord to help

them find their way out ot the
pit, all the lights go out and they
grope around the stage and into
part of the audience. Judging
from a few female yelps, they
must hold onto more than the
cord.
While in the pits, the boys
meet a witch who is portrayed
outstandingly by Candace
Laughlin. She does a perfect job
as an evil, cackling, old witch
and gives the only real strong
acting performance of the night.
I am sure that members of
the cast would point to the fact
that the show includes not one,
but two nude scenes, as a sign of
theatrical maturity and sophisti
cation. "If they did it once,
they'll do it again."
The first lovemaking scene
between the queen and her lover
is preceded by verbal foreplay in
some unrecognizable gobbdy
lgook language. They must have
enjoyed their first encounter
immensely for they repeat it
later in the show, this time with
a background of six or eight
gyrating nude bodies.
Up and Down
For variety's sake the second
lovemaking scene is horizontal
instead of vertical. It is also
longer and nosier than the first
for theatergoers who keep track
of such things.
One of the few redeeming

features of "The Beard" was
good acting. One can't say the
same for "The Emergence." The
witch is outstanding and a few
other actors show small flashes
of talent but little more. The
music including a guitar, drums,
cymbals and gongs is unexciting.
The lighting effects are the only
real strong part of the produc
tion, especially near the end
where there are some good light
show-type things and a beautiful
prism effect.
The dialogue in the last
moments is very appropriate.
While the cast holds candles and
smoke envelopes the stage, one
of the actors explains in philo
sophical terms, what must be
part of the "message" of the
show.
He talks about how "The
question is not To Be or Not To
Be, but is To Be or To Be
Forgotten." This doesn't really
explain the show very well but it
is good advice for the audience.
The sooner I can forget "The
Emergence" the better I'll feel.

gence" will continue nightly at
