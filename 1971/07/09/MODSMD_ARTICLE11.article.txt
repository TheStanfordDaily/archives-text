# 'Beard' Superb Acting

### 
Placing two American foik
heroes side-by-side on stage
and locking them in sexual
combat is a neat way to show
us something about our na
tional sexual myths. And the
use of obscenity isn't for
shock alone, but forms the
logical mode of attack and
sexual play for two arche
types â€” the tough blonde
knockout and the super-cool
m in of violence.
Cole and Silbert (who are
husband and- wife in this
world) make every verbal
fragment worth following.

Little Theater.
8 p.m.

Miss Cole slftiks around
stage, posfng, pouting and
now seductive, now
a little girl." She is an impos
ing Harlow, tall and lanky,
and she moves convincingly
from one mood to another
without a lapse in credibility.
She keeps the audience glued
to her as she vamps around.
Silbert's characterization
of Billy matches Miss Cole's
Harlow. His Billy appears at
first to be a lunkhead. Grad
ually Silbert reveals the un
derlying intelligence of his
role.
What makes this production
good theater is the excellent
acting of Elizabeth Cole and
Petejr Silbert, and the fine di
recting of Leo Gro*n
