# Bernstein's 'Candide'
## Musical Shows Strong Potential 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The San Francisco Civic Light
Opera opened its second produc
tion of the season Tuesday
night, a revival of the musical
"Candide."
This is a very important
production, for several reasons:
first, it is a reworking of
Leonard Bernstein's early 1950's
show, with book by Lillian
Hellman. The original was a
critical success, but a box office
failure, and closed after a short
Broadway run. The general com
plaint was that it was too
complex, too difficult. With
drawn from production, it has
been unavailable for almost 20
years.
The Lillian Hellman book has
been rewritten by Sheldon Patin
kin for this production, and Mr.
Bernstein has written additional
music.
Kennedy Opener
Second, the show is unusually

important because it has been
scheduled to open the Kennedy
Theater Center in Washington,
D.C., next October. After that,
it is scheduled for a Broadway
run.
So you see, one cannot be
flippant about "Candide." And
in a way, this is a good sign for
the Civic Light Opera. Until
recently, the CLO was just
another stop for road shows
doing the national circuit after
exhausting their box office po
tential in New York. But the last
three CLO shows have been
heading toward Broadway, not
away from it, and San Francisco
has had the opportunity to be in
on the beginning of new theatri
cal ventures.
This, of course, entails some
risk. The road shows are guaran
teed successes in the box office,
and are likely to be critical
successes too. New, untested
shows are open to unmerciful
drubbings by the critics, and are

especially vulnerable because
they are unfinished and in need
of further work.
While the CLO's largely mid
dle-aged, middle-class subscrip
tion audience will remain faith
ful through the most severe
critical attacks, successive pan
nings are bound to hurt in the
long run.
Hope
So, to get back to "Candide,"
treating this show with all the
respect it certainly deserves, I

must confess to disappointment,
and to considerable amounts of
hope.
The first question that arises
is, can anyone successfully trans
pose Voltaire's wit, sarcasm,
satire, and philosophic attacks
on Leibintz, into a musical play?
I must confess that I don't
know. By Mr. Bernstein's own
admission, his first attempt was
a failure. Certainly his second
attempt is also short of success.
The show begins with great
spirit, life, and wit. Scene one
contains considerable amounts
of Voltaire, read verbatim by a
narrator, and cleverly worked
into the lyrics and dialogue. But
after this auspicious beginning,
M. Voltaire is abondoned for
purposes of theatrical effect, and
Miss Hellman and Mr. Patinkin
take over. As talented as these
artists may be, they are not
Voltaire, the show begins to pale
by comparison, and then be

come tedious, and, by the last
scene, stops entirely.
Added Depth
A serious problem is that Miss
Hellman, or Mr. Patinkin, or
perhaps both, have found it
necessary to tamper with the
characters of Candide and Cune
gonde. For Voltaire, they were
simply two-dimensional pawns
to be kicked about by a
disinterested and often brutal
humanity. Unfortunately, they
have now acquired depth. Cune-

gonde is an avaricious slut, and
Candide a bright young man
who, by the end of the play, has
become a bitter cynic.
Only Dr. Pangloss, the fool of
an optimist, comes through
relatively unscathed. What can
you do to a man who believes
(or says he believes) that this is
the Best of All Possible Worlds?
Once again, it must be em
phasized that this is not a
finished product. Judicious cut
ting and some rewriting can
tighten up the play considerably.
There is no reason to believe
that the whole show cannot be
as vibrant as the first scene, and
if that were to happen, this
would be the most literate and
intelligent musical since "Fiddler
on the Roof," "My Fair Lady,"
or even "West Side Story."
Famous Overture
Which brings me to the
music. A large sign in the lobby
proclaims the management's re

fusal to seat anyone during the
playing of the Overture. And
rightly so, for the overture to
"Candide" has become part of
the standard light-symphonic
repertoire. Unfortunately, this is
one of those shows in which the
most appealing music is played
before the curtain rises.
Most of Mr. Bernstein's songs,
while complex and demanding
of the singers, are unmelodic and
tiring. Mr. Bernstein says that
this is his favorite score, and it is
understandable that he would
feel that way. It is certainly his
most ambitious. But it is not
complex enough for opera, not
light enough for musical com
edy. It has neither the spirit of
"On the Town," the humor of
"Wonderful Town," nor the
intensity of "West Side Story."
With few exceptions (and they
are marvelous exceptions!) it is
rather dull.
Lyricists Richard Wilbur and
John La Touche match Mr.
Bernstein's performance. Some
of the songs are witty, with lines
like "What a wonderful day/For
an auto-da-fe," but others are
just boring. Once again, work is
needed.
Costa Sings
The production is expensive,
elaborate, and thoroughly pro
fessional. It is significant that
the leads are played by opera
stars. Mary Costa, who in her
spare time sings with the Bol
shoi, Metropolitan, and San
Francisco Operas, plays Cune
gonde. What singing she does,
she does magnificantly, with a
beautiful sense of comedy, and
coloratura showmanship.
Frank Porretta as Candide is
less successful, but, poor fellow,
he has one of the worst selection
of songs I have ever heard.
Nearly every one is a versision of
"Candide Complains." After a
while, a very short while, one
tires of lamentations.
In the first scene, one of the
characters ingratiates himself to
the audience by telling him to
"shut up and go away" after he
has moaned about the stage for
three minutes. Alas, that mo
ment is never repeated.
The night I saw it Mr.
Porretta did not seem to be in
good voice, but I am sure that
this was a question of second
night letdown (a not uncommon
phenomenon), and is not to be
held against him.
Douglas Campbell plays the
Narrator. Dr. Pangloss and Mar
tin. and personally helps to keep
the show going when it bogs
down for the nth time. Rae
Allen, a Tony Award-winner,
plays the Old Lady with energy
and ability, but doesn't seem
nearly tired enough to really be
an Old Lady, half of whose
backside has been cut off and
eaten by Bulgarian pirates.
Director Sheldon Pali n kin
must bear the blame for the slow
death that the show suffers
(beginning with scene two), but
as the writer he also has the
unique opportunity to pull the
thing together before it goes to
Washington. This is a play which
has a marvelous potential, and
we can only hope that Mr.
Patinkin, together with Mr.
Bernstein, Mr. Wilbur and Mr.
LaTouche, will bring it off

The question is, can anyone
successfully transpose Voltaire's
wit and sarcasm into a musical
play?
