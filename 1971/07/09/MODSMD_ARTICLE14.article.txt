# Computerized Music Challenges Old Pros
## 
### DICK GEIKIE 
In this age of evolution and
innovation, not even Bach and
Beethoven can escape untainted.
Dr. Leland Smith, acting chair
man of the Music department, is
teaching a concentrated, four
week course in Computer Gener
ated Music which would dazzle
the old masters.
Developed about fifteen years
ago at the Bell Telephone Labs,
computer generated music has
evolved into an accepted form of
musical expression, with Stan
ford having plans for the world's
first music department computer
center.
Dr. Smith's course is an
intensive one, with classes run
ning from 6 a.m. to noon, four
days a week.
"Most of the people taking
the course," explained Dr.
Smith, "are from other univer
sities. They are learning the
techniques of generating com
puter music to return and set up
similar departments at their own
schools."
Generating computer music is
very involved. A computer pro
gram, which will instruct the
computer to "spit out" different
quantities and arrangements of
signals or bits at rates as high as
100,000 bits per second, must

be written out. These signals are
then transformed into different
voltages, depending upon the
signals, which are amplified to
drive speakers.
When asked whether or not
he considers the computer a
legitimate form of musical ex
pression, Dr. Smith replied,
"Absolutely, the computer is a
musical instrument. The pro
grammer is actually an arranger.
As with any instrument, Dr.
Smith believes one must "learn
what the computer can do
before he can improvise with
new sounds. You don't learn to
play the violin with Paganini's
concerto, you start with Jack
Benny exercises. All my students
start with Bach fugal arrange
ments before improvising
sounds."
Today, the cost of computers
limits the use of computerized
music to universities or other
large institutions. Within ten
years, according to Dr. Smith,
"computer music systems should
cost about $50,000, the cost of
a good pipe organ or instruments
for an average sized orchestra."
Dr. Smith believes that com
puter music doesn't avail itself
to popular music as well as other
musical forms. "Pop music is 80
percent improvisation and com
puter music takes a great deal of
organizing and planning."
