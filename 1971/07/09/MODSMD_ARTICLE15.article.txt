# Procedure Hit
## 
### 
Jim Berk, president of United
Stanford Employees (USE),
charged Thursday that "the
University is manipulating the
grievance procedures to meet its
own needs, depriving the work
ers of any protection those
procedures provide."
Referring to a statement by
University personnel director
Robert Nelson delineating pro
cedures for the grievance hearing
of John Dolly one of the five
university employees fired for
alleged participation in the April
9 hospital sit-in, Berk said,
"Nelson is inventing the rule
that he gets to give the charge to
the grievance committee. It's not
up to him to give the charge."
Also speaking at the Thurs
day USE meeting at the hospital
v :ti Mi art in Eichner, counsel for
Dolly, Professor Leon Rosen
berg, department of Medical
Microbiology, and Lee Herzen
berg, research associate in the
department of Genetics and
Obstetrics and Gynecology.
Herzenberg joined Berk in
criticism of Nelson, stating that,
"Contrary to what Nelson said
in Tuesday's Daily, I have been
told that the Dolly grievance
committee has not withdrawn its
recommendations that Dolly be
reinstated until the committee
completes the hearings and
makes its final recommendations
and that the beginning of the
hearing be postponed until
Dolly finishes with his court
trial.
"According to my source,
Provost Miller rejected the rec
ommendation but it still stands
as a matter of record. The
grievance committee should pub
licly confirm or deny this."
When contacted by the Daily,
grievance committee chairman
H. Keith H. Brodie declined to
comment on this matter.
