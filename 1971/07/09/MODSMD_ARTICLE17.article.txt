'RIDE ON!'
Working on the premise that
the automobile need not be the
only means of transportation in
the Bay Area, three students, as
part of SWOPSI, the Stanford
Workshops on Political and So
cial Issues, have compiled a
book, "Ride On!" listing infor
mation on all of the Bay Area
public transportation services.
The three, Charles Lisle,
Christopher Lovelock and Chris
Hendrickson, compiled the list
during the winter and spring
quarters of the past academic
year and are distributing 1200
copies of the book free through
SWOPSI to new summer session

students. The book can also be
purchased at local bookstores
for 50 cents.
Included in the book are bus
routes, timetables and fares for
transportation in and around
Palo Alto, Redwood City, San
Jose, San Francisco. Directions
on how to get from Stanford to
San Francisco, Marin County,
Berkeley, Oakland, East Bay
points and "far-out places" like
Santa Rosa and Vallejo are also
included.
BAZILE, LAURY
The pre-trial date for Leo
Bazile and Christopher Laury,

who entered pleas of not guilty
to charges of assaulting a Hos
pital medical employee, has been
set for Sept. 10.
A jury trial is scheduled for
Sept. 20.
WOMEN'S ADMISSIONS UP
Stanford's Medical School
will admit 16 women to a
freshman class of 77 students
next year. This number is nearly
twice that admitted in previous

years and reflects a new policy
of the medical school's faculty
expressing "Stanford's clear con
viction that more women are
needed in medicine nationally,"
according to an article by Drs.
John P. Bunker and Judith Pool
of Stanford in the New England
Journal of Medicine.
The same issue of this pres
tigious journal carries an adver
tisement openly recruiting wo
men for faculty positions here in
departments varying from anes

thesia to surgery. Previously,
work of faculty openings had
been spread by friends and
colleagues, a method which had
traditionally excluded informing
women.
At present, only eight women
are on the faculty of nearly 300,
and only two of these have
tenure.
Dr. Nancy Cross, a Stanford
graduate, filed a lawsuit claiming
discrimination against women by
the School of Medicine as
characterized by the traditional-"
ly low number of women stud
ents accepted. She feels that the
push to enroll more women
students was a response to such
recent criticism.
