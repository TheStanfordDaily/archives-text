# KZSU Offers Full Summer Programming
## 
### 
For the first time the Stan
ford radio station KZSU is
broadcasting a full schedule of
programming during the sum
mer. The station, 90.1 FM, can
be heard every day from 7 in the
morning to 4 the next morning.
Most of the programs are
music, and the music is mostly
rock. However, each disc jockey
is free to choose any kind of
music he wants to play, and this
usually results in a wide variety
in each four-hour show and even
more during the whole day.
Because all the disc jockeys
are students, the station boasts
that music played is pretty much
what Stanford people want to
listen to. In addition, KZSU tries
to present the least amount of
talk possible, and the most
music. According to Program
Director Bob Ross, "We try to
stay away from sounding like a
high-pressure top 40 station."
In addition to music, the
summer broadcasting schedule
includes a full complement of

news and public affairs broad
casts. KZSU News can be heard
at 5, 6, 8, and 10 p.m. in the
evening, while Close-Up, the
public affairs broadcast, is heard
at 7 nightly.
During the regular year the
station operates with a staff of
about 50 to 70 people, but
during this summer it's a differ
ent situation. Twelve full-time
staff members, assisted by a few
volunteers, keep the station
going.
According to Bob Fuss, Pub
lic Affairs Director, "It keeps us
pretty busy. Everybody here has
about three jobs." All the staff
members work in at least two
aspects of the stations opera
tions—music, news, public af
fairs, sales—and in addition
everyone participates in work
crews on KZSU's project to

relocate one of its studios, the
newsroom, and the engineering
facilities.
Apart from being a bit
understaffed, the station's only
real problem is financial. The
money which KZSU receives
from the student body and the
University allows it to operate
during the academic year, but
the summer operation is funded
entirely by donations from the
community.
So far, the station has receiv
ed about enough to meet its
operating expenses, but not
enough to begin paying salaries
to the full-time staffers. This has
already caused the loss of one
staff member, and may force
others to leave.
If no more money is incom
ing, this may close the station

down, something which its staff
members feel would be a real
loss.
"We're the only full-time
non-commercial broadcaster in
this area," says News Director

Bob Lundstrom, "and there are
a lot of things that only a
non-commercial station can af
ford to do. If we have to go off
the air, they simply won't get
done."
