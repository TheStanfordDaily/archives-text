### DEBBY STORZ 
"To raise women's conscious
ness and to co-ordinate and
direct women to programs and
events in the community"—
that's the goal of the newly
organized Women's Center, ac
cording to its co-ordinator Jane
Turner.
The Center, located on the
third floor of the Women's
Clubhouse, is currently being
sponsored by the Stanford
UWCA, but remains autono
mous.
An information center, with a
small library of books and
articles on women, it also
provides a place for informal
"rap" sessions. Newsletters of
Bay Area events are sent out to
women in the community who
have dropped in and expressed
an interest in the Center.
"We direct women to such
things as counseling services,
day-care center information, and
self-defense classes," Turner
said.
Their mixed media produc
tion, "On Freeing Women .. .
(and possibly men)," has per
formed for various women's
clubs and high school groups.
The 30-minute production
makes use of film, pantomime
and readings to comment on role
stereotyping in American so
ciety.
The Center's biggest summer
project will be the campus
appearance of Angela Davis'
mother, Sallye Davis, August 1.
Plans for fall include a "fix-it"
class in which women learn to
repair plumbing, fuses, and elec
trical appliances, an auto me
chanics class, and a Basic Female
Hygiene Class (to give informa
tion on the medical side of being
a woman).
Jane Turner expressed the
Center's hope "to be a coordin
ating center for all women's
organizations on campus."
"We're like an organized
grapevine," explained YWCA di
rector Penny Mann.
