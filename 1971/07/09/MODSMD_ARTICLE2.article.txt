# Junior Faculty Appointments
## Politics Color Decision? 
### MADELINE NELSON News Analysis 
The system for assigning
faculty appointments and giving
promotions to teachers below
the tenure level has always been
complicated. This year it became
the center of controversy when
it came time to consider the
future of four leftist assistant
professors.
Ed Greenberg, Joe Paff, and
Peter Ober were given appoint
ments for just one additional
year instead of the usual three.
After the coming year they will
leave Stanford. George Kaplan
was originally in the same
position, but was eventually
reappointed for 3 years.
Although each case is differ
ent, they all feel that the
decisions were influenced by
their political views. Their de
partments and the administra
tion state that they were fired
for traditional reasons, primarily
the failure to publish.
Nonconform ism
The problem appears to be

partly semantic. The young
professors define "political" so
broadly that failure to conform
to the faculty stereotype is a
political act. None of them has
chosen to conform: Paff never
finished his Ph.D. Ober has not
had many publications. Green
berg and Kaplan are radically
shifting the emphasis of their
work to new areas.
With the exception of Green
berg, they are willing to admit
that there was not a strong case
for reappointment by traditional
standards. However, they all feel
that the entire university system
(and their own academic discip
lines) need to be radically
revised. They see their resistance

as a challenge to a system that is
too archaic to respond.
The tenure system is designed
to protect the faculty from
political influence but until they
reach the tenure level of asso
ciate professor, faculty members
enjoy few safeguards. As the
four concede, there is no way to
prove that any decision is
political, and most admit that
the political factors in their own
cases were probably subcon
scious.
But beyond the details of
their cases, they agree with
History Professor Hal Kahn that
the "question is whether the
procedure lends itself to subtle

cutters, left the wheel chained to the support outside Tresidder but

political decisions." Arguments
can be made that these firings
were not political except in the
broad sense—that removing
people who refuse to play
according to the rules is politi
cal. But the system for junior
faculty appointments is open to
such influence because of what
Greenberg calls "the total lack
of due process."
At the present time it is
possible, as happened in Green
berg's case, for an appointment
to be fought all the way to the
Provost's Office without the
applicant being aware of it. The
department chairman is under
no obligation to inform the
applicant of anything except the
final decision, clearly making it
impossible for him to defend
himself.
The System
The first decision is made by
the tenured faculty in a depart
mental vote to reappoint, pro
mote or fire. If the decision is
negative, as it was for Paff and
Ober, there is no recourse and
no justification for the decision
need be given. Professor Albert
Hastorf, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, feels strongly that the
person should be told the vote
and the reasons, but individual
department chairmen may chose
to do otherwise.
When the vote is favorable (it
does not have to be unanimous,
according to Hastorf), a record
of the recommendation and any
dissent is sent to the Dean's
office where it is evaluated by
the staff. If a faculty member
knows the status of his case he
can ask that letters in support be
considered as part of this pro-
C6SS.
The Dean's staff either ap
proves the reappointment or
asks for more supporting evi
dence. The evidence the staff is
looking for, according to Has
torf, "is primarily in regard to
teaching." If the dean's office
has reservations and the depart
ment does not submit more
data, the recommendation will

be rejected. Apparently this
happened in the Kaplan case,
which was reopened when addi
tional information was sent.
The process is only half over
at this stage. Once the dean's
staff approves the appointment,
the "approval" is sent to the
Provost's office where it is
reexamined. (Senior faculty ap
pointments are even more com
plicated and go through an
advisory committee as well.)
Although several recommenda
tions were questioned by the
Provost this year, only Green
berg was not rehired because of
a decision at this level.
Last Step
Beyond this point there is
one last hurdle, the Advisory
Board of the President which is
usually considered a rubber
stamp. This year the Board did
question some decisions, but no
applicant was turned down as a
result of a decision by this
group.
At a time when tenure is
being criticized, some arguments
for its existence are swelling as a
result of conflicts at lower levels
in the faculty. The system for
evaluating junior faculty lacks
most of the protections which
the system for evaluating candi
dates for tenure provides, so
while it is far from clear that this
procedure has been used at
Stanford to punish political
views, there would be little
recourse for the junior faculty if
a department or the administra
tion chose to do so.

for its existence are swelling as a
result of conflicts at lower levels
in the faculty. The system for
evaluating junior faculty lacks
most of the protections which
the system for evaluating candi
dates for tenure provides, so
while it is far from clear that this
procedure has been used at
Stanford to punish political
views, there would be little
recourse for the junior faculty if
a department or the administra
tion chose to do so.

The system for assigning
faculty appointments and giving
promotions to teachers below
the tenure level has always been
complicated. This year it became
the center of controversy when
it came time to consider the
future of four leftist assistant
professors.
Ed Greenberg, Joe Paff, and
Peter Ober were given appoint
ments for just one additional
year instead of the usual three.
After the coming year they will
leave Stanford. George Kaplan
was originally in the same
position, but was eventually
reappointed for 3 years.
Although each case is differ
ent, they all feel that the
decisions were influenced by
their political views. Their de
partments and the administra
tion state that they were fired
for traditional reasons, primarily
the failure to publish.
Nonconform ism
The problem appears to be

partly semantic. The young
professors define "political" so
broadly that failure to conform
to the faculty stereotype is a
political act. None of them has
chosen to conform: Paff never
finished his Ph.D. Ober has not
had many publications. Green
berg and Kaplan are radically
shifting the emphasis of their
work to new areas.
With the exception of Green
berg, they are willing to admit
that there was not a strong case
for reappointment by traditional
standards. However, they all feel
that the entire university system
(and their own academic discip
lines) need to be radically
revised. They see their resistance

as a challenge to a system that is
too archaic to respond.
The tenure system is designed
to protect the faculty from
political influence but until they
reach the tenure level of asso
ciate professor, faculty members
enjoy few safeguards. As the
four concede, there is no way to
prove that any decision is
political, and most admit that
the political factors in their own
cases were probably subcon
scious.
But beyond the details of
their cases, they agree with
History Professor Hal Kahn that
the "question is whether the
procedure lends itself to subtle

cutters, left the wheel chained to the support outside Tresidder but

political decisions." Arguments
can be made that these firings
were not political except in the
broad sense—that removing
people who refuse to play
according to the rules is politi
cal. But the system for junior
faculty appointments is open to
such influence because of what
Greenberg calls "the total lack
of due process."
At the present time it is
possible, as happened in Green
berg's case, for an appointment
to be fought all the way to the
Provost's Office without the
applicant being aware of it. The
department chairman is under
no obligation to inform the
applicant of anything except the
final decision, clearly making it
impossible for him to defend
himself.
The System
The first decision is made by
the tenured faculty in a depart
mental vote to reappoint, pro
mote or fire. If the decision is
negative, as it was for Paff and
Ober, there is no recourse and
no justification for the decision
need be given. Professor Albert
Hastorf, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, feels strongly that the
person should be told the vote
and the reasons, but individual
department chairmen may chose
to do otherwise.
When the vote is favorable (it
does not have to be unanimous,
according to Hastorf), a record
of the recommendation and any
dissent is sent to the Dean's
office where it is evaluated by
the staff. If a faculty member
knows the status of his case he
can ask that letters in support be
considered as part of this pro-
C6SS.
The Dean's staff either ap
proves the reappointment or
asks for more supporting evi
dence. The evidence the staff is
looking for, according to Has
torf, "is primarily in regard to
teaching." If the dean's office
has reservations and the depart
ment does not submit more
data, the recommendation will

be rejected. Apparently this
happened in the Kaplan case,
which was reopened when addi
tional information was sent.
The process is only half over
at this stage. Once the dean's
staff approves the appointment,
the "approval" is sent to the
Provost's office where it is
reexamined. (Senior faculty ap
pointments are even more com
plicated and go through an
advisory committee as well.)
Although several recommenda
tions were questioned by the
Provost this year, only Green
berg was not rehired because of
a decision at this level.
Last Step
Beyond this point there is
one last hurdle, the Advisory
Board of the President which is
usually considered a rubber
stamp. This year the Board did
question some decisions, but no
applicant was turned down as a
result of a decision by this
group.

a decision at this level.
Last Step
Beyond this point there is
one last hurdle, the Advisory
Board of the President which is
usually considered a rubber
stamp. This year the Board did
question some decisions, but no
applicant was turned down as a
result of a decision by this
group.
At a time when tenure is
being criticized, some arguments
for its existence are swelling as a
result of conflicts at lower levels
in the faculty. The system for
evaluating junior faculty lacks
most of the protections which
the system for evaluating candi
dates for tenure provides, so
while it is far from clear that this
procedure has been used at
Stanford to punish political
views, there would be little
recourse for the junior faculty if
a department or the administra
tion chose to do so.

The system for assigning
faculty appointments and giving
promotions to teachers below
the tenure level has always been
complicated. This year it became
the center of controversy when
it came time to consider the
future of four leftist assistant
professors.
Ed Greenberg, Joe Paff, and
Peter Ober were given appoint
ments for just one additional
year instead of the usual three.
After the coming year they will
leave Stanford. George Kaplan
was originally in the same
position, but was eventually
reappointed for 3 years.
Although each case is differ
ent, they all feel that the
decisions were influenced by
their political views. Their de
partments and the administra
tion state that they were fired
for traditional reasons, primarily
the failure to publish.
Nonconform ism
The problem appears to be

partly semantic. The young
professors define "political" so
broadly that failure to conform
to the faculty stereotype is a
political act. None of them has
chosen to conform: Paff never
finished his Ph.D. Ober has not
had many publications. Green
berg and Kaplan are radically
shifting the emphasis of their
work to new areas.
With the exception of Green
berg, they are willing to admit
that there was not a strong case
for reappointment by traditional
standards. However, they all feel
that the entire university system
(and their own academic discip
lines) need to be radically
revised. They see their resistance

as a challenge to a system that is
too archaic to respond.
The tenure system is designed
to protect the faculty from
political influence but until they
reach the tenure level of asso
ciate professor, faculty members
enjoy few safeguards. As the
four concede, there is no way to
prove that any decision is
political, and most admit that
the political factors in their own
cases were probably subcon
scious.
But beyond the details of
their cases, they agree with
History Professor Hal Kahn that
the "question is whether the
procedure lends itself to subtle

political decisions." Arguments
can be made that these firings
were not political except in the
broad sense—that removing
people who refuse to play
according to the rules is politi
cal. But the system for junior
faculty appointments is open to
such influence because of what
Greenberg calls "the total lack
of due process."
At the present time it is
possible, as happened in Green
berg's case, for an appointment
to be fought all the way to the
Provost's Office without the
applicant being aware of it. The
department chairman is under
no obligation to inform the
applicant of anything except the
final decision, clearly making it
impossible for him to defend
himself.
The System
The first decision is made by
the tenured faculty in a depart
mental vote to reappoint, pro
mote or fire. If the decision is
negative, as it was for Paff and
Ober, there is no recourse and
no justification for the decision
need be given. Professor Albert
Hastorf, Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, feels strongly that the
person should be told the vote
and the reasons, but individual
department chairmen may chose
to do otherwise.
When the vote is favorable (it
does not have to be unanimous,
according to Hastorf), a record
of the recommendation and any
dissent is sent to the Dean's
office where it is evaluated by
the staff. If a faculty member
knows the status of his case he
can ask that letters in support be
considered as part of this pro-
C6SS.
The Dean's staff either ap
proves the reappointment or
asks for more supporting evi
dence. The evidence the staff is
looking for, according to Has
torf, "is primarily in regard to
teaching." If the dean's office
has reservations and the depart
ment does not submit more
data, the recommendation will

be rejected. Apparently this
happened in the Kaplan case,
which was reopened when addi
tional information was sent.
The process is only half over
at this stage. Once the dean's
staff approves the appointment,
the "approval" is sent to the
Provost's office where it is
reexamined. (Senior faculty ap
pointments are even more com
plicated and go through an
advisory committee as well.)
Although several recommenda
tions were questioned by the
Provost this year, only Green
berg was not rehired because of
a decision at this level.

Beyond this point there is
one last hurdle, the Advisory
Board of the President which is
