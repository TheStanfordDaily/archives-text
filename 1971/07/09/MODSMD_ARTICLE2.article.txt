# Junior Faculty Appointments
## Politics Color Decision? 
### MADELINE NELSON News Analysis 
The system for assigning
faculty appointments and giving
promotions to teachers below
the tenure level has always been
complicated. This year it became
the center of controversy when
it came time to consider the
future of four leftist assistant
professors.
Ed Greenberg, Joe Paff, and
Peter Ober were given appoint
ments for just one additional
year instead of the usual three.
After the coming year they will
leave Stanford. George Kaplan
was originally in the same
position, but was eventually
reappointed for 3 years.
Although each case is differ
ent, they all feel that the
decisions were influenced by
their political views. Their de
partments and the administra
tion state that they were fired
for traditional reasons, primarily
the failure to publish.
Nonconform ism
The problem appears to be

partly semantic. The young
professors define "political" so
broadly that failure to conform
to the faculty stereotype is a
political act. None of them has
chosen to conform: Paff never
finished his Ph.D. Ober has not
had many publications. Green
berg and Kaplan are radically
shifting the emphasis of their
work to new areas.
With the exception of Green
berg, they are willing to admit
that there was not a strong case
for reappointment by traditional
standards. However, they all feel
that the entire university system
(and their own academic discip
lines) need to be radically
revised. They see their resistance

as a challenge to a system that is
too archaic to respond.
The tenure system is designed
to protect the faculty from
political influence but until they
reach the tenure level of asso
ciate professor, faculty members
enjoy few safeguards. As the
four concede, there is no way to
prove that any decision is
political, and most admit that
the political factors in their own
cases were probably subcon
scious.
But beyond the details of
their cases, they agree with
History Professor Hal Kahn that
the "question is whether the
procedure lends itself to subtle


THE MISSING LINK—WeII, maybe, the missing wheel, but closer to
the missing bike. Bike "rip-off" artists, probably lacking wire
cutters, left the wheel chained to the support outside Tresidder but
took off with the rest of the bike.
