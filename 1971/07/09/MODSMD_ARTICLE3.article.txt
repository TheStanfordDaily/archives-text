# Officials Answer Minority Demands
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Minority group demands is
sued since February were tack
led in an official University
response published Wednesday.
A $20,000 grant for a Chi
cano Studies Program and a
$50,000 fund to attract minor
ity faculty members were the
most substantial innovations de
scribed in the report. A grant to
study possibilities for a Black
Studies Institute was also dis
cussed.
The report, written by As
sociate Provost Raymond Bac
chetti, was printed in Campus
Reports, a University publica
tion for faculty and staff.
The report was a summary of
replies officials earlier gave to
three groups which issued de
mands in February—the Black
Student's Union (BSU), Movi

miento Estudiantil Chicano
(MECHA), and Asian-American
Student Alliance (AASA).
Bacchetti said many of the
new projects in the report would
have been granted this year
without the format of absolute
demands.
Here is a summary of major
items in Bacchetti's report:
Faculty
A $50,000 fund has been
established to help hire new
minority faculty members. A
portion of the fund would
probably be used to supplement
the salary a particular depart
ment could offer to attract a
minority instructor, according to
Bacchetti (a MECHA spokesman
called the fund a token amount).
The University rejected de
mands that new minority faculty
be assigned directly to ethnic
study programs. Bacchetti said a
minority faculty member assign
ed to a regular department can
aid minority studies, but also h?
a solid position and "clear status
with his colleagues."
Academics
Funds were promised to con
tinue three courses on Asian-
American heritage supported by
AASA.
The Afro-American Studies
program received a $20,000
budget boost, and BSU got a
$4,250 planning grant—but no
final approval—for a Black Stud
ies Institute it demanded.
MECHA's demand for a Chi
cano Studies Program was an
swered by a $20,000 budget to
begin the project next year.
Admissions
Higher admissions percent
ages were demanded by blacks
(12 percent) and Chicanos
