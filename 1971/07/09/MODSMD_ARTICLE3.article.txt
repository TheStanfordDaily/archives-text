# Officials Answer Minority Demands
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Minority group demands is
sued since February were tack
led in an official University
response published Wednesday.
A $20,000 grant for a Chi
cano Studies Program and a
$50,000 fund to attract minor
ity faculty members were the
most substantial innovations de
scribed in the report. A grant to
study possibilities for a Black
Studies Institute was also dis
cussed.
The report, written by As
sociate Provost Raymond Bac
chetti, was printed in Campus
Reports, a University publica
tion for faculty and staff.
The report was a summary of
replies officials earlier gave to
three groups which issued de
mands in February—the Black
Student's Union (BSU), Movi

miento Estudiantil Chicano
(MECHA), and Asian-American
Student Alliance (AASA).
Bacchetti said many of the
new projects in the report would
have been granted this year
without the format of absolute
demands.
Here is a summary of major
items in Bacchetti's report:
Faculty
A $50,000 fund has been
established to help hire new
minority faculty members. A
portion of the fund would
probably be used to supplement
the salary a particular depart
ment could offer to attract a
minority instructor, according to
Bacchetti (a MECHA spokesman
called the fund a token amount).
The University rejected de
mands that new minority faculty
be assigned directly to ethnic
study programs. Bacchetti said a
minority faculty member assign
ed to a regular department can
aid minority studies, but also h?
a solid position and "clear status
with his colleagues."
Academics
Funds were promised to con
tinue three courses on Asian-
American heritage supported by
AASA.
The Afro-American Studies
program received a $20,000
budget boost, and BSU got a
$4,250 planning grant—but no
final approval—for a Black Stud
ies Institute it demanded.
MECHA's demand for a Chi
cano Studies Program was an
swered by a $20,000 budget to
begin the project next year.
Admissions
Higher admissions percent
ages were demanded by blacks
(12 percent) and Chicanos
(14-15 percent). All three groups
asked for more financial aid, and
BSU demanded direct influence
in admissions decisions. AASA
postponed detailed discussions
until fall.
Bacchetti reported that an
Academic Council committee is
still studying such demands. He
noted the committee's chairman,
Prof. Bienenstock, in May urged
further study of "non-traditional
admissions criteria" and ways of
attracting "academically com
petitive" minority applicants.
Housing
"Working through established
channels," AASA, BSU,
MECHA, and Native Americans
were all granted dorms with high
ethnic concentrations, Bacchetti
said. But MECHA and Native
Americans had demanded higher
concentrations than the 50 per
cent maximum they were given
in each of two houses.
Staff
Bacchetti's statement ad
mitted "a gap exists between
policies and practices" in several
aspects of the Affirmative Ac
tion Program (AAP) for minor
ity employment.
He said advancement of mi
nority employees to supervisory
positions has seldom occurred
and will also become a priority
next year.

University funds were not
granted for a MECHA seminar to
inform Santa Clara County Chi
canos about institutions which
affect them. But Stanford pro
mised to help seek foundation
support for the project.
The University supplied two
van-type vehicles for a MECHA
tutoring program and added a
second van to a similar BSU
project.
The University promised to
uige replacement housing if the
proposed Willow Expressway is
built through minority com
munities. And the report point
ed to a housing project on
Stanford land as a response to

shortages of low and moderate
income housing.
But Bacchetti said granting
demands for direct University
aid to communities "for com
munity purposes" would violate
the University's Founding Grant
and the law.
Demands 'Stylized'
Although agreeing broad lists
of demands were necessary in
earlier years, Bacchetti said in a
personal statement, "Now the
time and effort which goes into
making demands can be better
spent working directly with the
people who can provide answers,
make decisions, and implement
changes."
