# Ex-Student Sues University

### 
A $330,000 breach of contract suit against
the University was quietly filed a week ago in
Santa Clara County Superior Court by a former
student who has been trying to re-enter medical
sehool for four years.
Joseph Selliken, 25, claims that he "was
deprived of the opportunity to attend other
medical schools" after he was forced to leave the
School of Medicine in 1967, apparently for
academic reasons.
"1 haven't seen it | the suit|, this is the first
I've heard of it," John Schwartz, special assistant
to President Lyman, said yesterday afternoon.
According to Selliken's attorney, Martin
Eichner, the suit has not been served on the
University or any of the other defendants
because of negotiations being conducted with
University officials in an attempt to clear
Selliken's record so that he can attend medical
school again, either here or elsewhere.
The suit alleges that Selliken entered into a
contract with the University when he enrolled
here in 1966 and that the University had
outlined procedural safeguards to be followed
before a student could be expelled.

But, according to the suit, the University
officials ignored those safeguards and had acted
in "direct violation" of the Medical School
guidelines when they forced Selliken to leave.
Eichner told the Daily that the suit "will not
be served within the next week, but it probably
will be | served | sometime this summer." He said
that he had to file the suit before the four-year
statute of limitations expires, and that he could
wait "about a year" before he is required to serve
the suit on the University and the other
defendants.
Eichner said that "it's never been clear to .Joe
himself why he was dismissed." Selliken, who
could not be reached, apparently missed some
tests and, the suit alleges, was promised and then
denied the opportunity to take make-up
examinations.
Selliken, who now lives in Palo Alto, entered
the School of Medicine at age 20, and was
concurrently taking undergraduate courses. He
has since received his BS from the University.
