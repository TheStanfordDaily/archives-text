TALL TREE, Calif., June 29
— Moving quickly to prevent
further right-wing student dem
onstrations at California Anti-
Revisionist Institute Number
Seven, Acting President Frank
H. Bruce ordered immediate
reinstatement of the People's
Liberation Army's ROTC pro
gram.
"I had no idea that so many
people are into ROTC," the
former associate professor of
English told a large gathering of
former faculty members now
being reeducated as custodians.
"I guess we'll just have to bring
it back."
The Institute, formedy
known as Stanford University
(named after the railroad baron),
originally eliminated ROTC in
1973, and the program was not
resumed after The Revolution.
"I had thought that the
program was outdated, but I was
wrong," Bruce said, explaining
his error.
On-ROTC
John Kelp, a leader of the
On-ROTC Coalition, said he was
"gratified" by Bruce's decision,
but said that Bruce "will make
the same error again when
confronted with a similar situa
tion.
"Whenever the cause of the
people is entrusted to professors,
it is lost," Kelp said, quoting
Lenin.
However, Bruce was still in
trouble with many of the stu
dents and workers at the Insti

tute over the firing of a hospital
custodian, Lyman Richards.
Bruce, who personally fired
Richards on grounds of "incom
petence and revisionism," was
rebuffed by three Workers' Com
mittees, each of which ruled the
former professor of English
history is "well qualified to push
a broom and participate in
Hospital decision-making proces
ses."
In a rare action aimed at
"preserving the Institute and
serving The People," however,
Bruce overruled the workers,
causing a week-long wildcat
strike in all Institute depart
ments but his own, where
workers are barred from joining
a union for "security reasons."
Students, who quickly rallied
to Richards' side, have held a
sit-in and a mill-in, and have
bombed three buildings in his
support. They have also threat
ened to "mine the entire campus
and seize Mao Tower (Mao
Tow)," but Bruce has "called
their bluff."
People's Deputies
"I am sure the Anti-Revision
ist Institute will still be standing
by the dawn's early light," he
told a cheering crowd of Santa
Clara County People's Deputies
and California People's Highway
Patrolmen lead by one of
Bruce's old friends, John Follie.
"I'm sure you're right,
boss," Follie replied.
Earlier, Provost Willie Old
berry promised to keep the
school "open at any price."
"I don't know what we'll
have to do to control these
opportunist elements," he said,

"but I'm sure we'll manage to
keep the situation well in hand.
"Even if we have to reinstate
ROTC, we can still keep this
school for The People," Oldberry
said. "I'm afraid it might attract
more white people, though, and
that would be incorrect. But if
Bruce wants to do it, then I say
it's right on."
To further complicate the
Institute's delicate situation,
moderate students showed their
disapproval with the state of the
world two nights ago by trash
ing every window on campus,
including those in their own
dormitory rooms. They have
also threatened to re-open the
library and declassify the non-

Marxist-Leninist economics and
political theory books located in
thp locked stacks.
"We demand the right to read
all of those revisionists," declar
ed moderate student leader Wil
liam E. Miller. Miller, 67, from
Ft. Hood, Albania, told report
ers that "I've discovered that 99
percent of the time, the man's
technology is stronger than the
power of the people. But that
one time out of 100, watch
out!"
Meanwhile, left-wing stu
dents, lead by a group calling
itself the Free Campus Move
ment, have demanded the re
moval of all police from Insti
tute grounds on the basis that

the presence of law enforcement
officials "inhibits the free and
orderly expression of Marxist-
Leninist ideals."
The left-wingers also demand
ed abolition of the People's
Bomb Squad and the addition of
a People's Armory and Rifle
Range behind each dormitory.
"In order to put down the
gun, we must take up the gun,"
the group said in a statement.
"The Revolution wasn't enough;
the bureaucrats like Bruce have
taken over. It's time for a
purge."
(Ed Kohn, a member of the
Pig Press For Love and Struggle
affinity group, is girding himself
for Armageddon.)

custodian, Lyman Richards.
Bruce, who personally fired
Richards on grounds of "incom
petence and revisionism," was
rebuffed by three Workers' Com
mittees, each of which ruled the
former professor of English
history is "well qualified to push
a broom and participate in
Hospital decision-making proces
ses."
In a rare action aimed at
"preserving the Institute and
serving The People," however,
Bruce overruled the workers,
causing a week-long wildcat
strike in all Institute depart
ments but his own, where
workers are barred from joining
a union for "security reasons."
Students, who quickly rallied
to Richards' side, have held a
sit-in and a mill-in, and have
bombed three buildings in his
support. They have also threat
ened to "mine the entire campus
and seize Mao Tower (Mao
Tow)," but Bruce has "called
their bluff."
People's Deputies
"I am sure the Anti-Revision
ist Institute will still be standing
by the dawn's early light," he
told a cheering crowd of Santa
Clara County People's Deputies
and California People's Highway
Patrolmen lead by one of
Bruce's old friends, John Follie.
"I'm sure you're right,
boss," Follie replied.
Earlier, Provost Willie Old
berry promised to keep the
school "open at any price."
"I don't know what we'll
have to do to control these
opportunist elements," he said,

"but I'm sure we'll manage to
keep the situation well in hand.
"Even if we have to reinstate
ROTC, we can still keep this
school for The People," Oldberry
said. "I'm afraid it might attract
more white people, though, and
that would be incorrect. But if
Bruce wants to do it, then I say
it's right on."
To further complicate the
Institute's delicate situation,
moderate students showed their
disapproval with the state of the
world two nights ago by trash
ing every window on campus,
including those in their own
dormitory rooms. They have
also threatened to re-open the
library and declassify the non-

Marxist-Leninist economics and
political theory books located in
thp locked stacks.
"We demand the right to read
all of those revisionists," declar
ed moderate student leader Wil
liam E. Miller. Miller, 67, from
Ft. Hood, Albania, told report
ers that "I've discovered that 99
percent of the time, the man's
technology is stronger than the
power of the people. But that
one time out of 100, watch
out!"
Meanwhile, left-wing stu
dents, lead by a group calling
itself the Free Campus Move
ment, have demanded the re
moval of all police from Insti
tute grounds on the basis that

the presence of law enforcement
officials "inhibits the free and
orderly expression of Marxist-
Leninist ideals."
The left-wingers also demand
ed abolition of the People's
Bomb Squad and the addition of
a People's Armory and Rifle
Range behind each dormitory.
"In order to put down the
gun, we must take up the gun,"
the group said in a statement.
"The Revolution wasn't enough;
the bureaucrats like Bruce have
taken over. It's time for a
purge."

TALL TREE, Calif., June 29
— Moving quickly to prevent
further right-wing student dem
onstrations at California Anti-
Revisionist Institute Number
Seven, Acting President Frank
H. Bruce ordered immediate
reinstatement of the People's
Liberation Army's ROTC pro
gram.
"I had no idea that so many
people are into ROTC," the
former associate professor of
English told a large gathering of
former faculty members now
being reeducated as custodians.
"I guess we'll just have to bring
it back."
The Institute, formedy
known as Stanford University
(named after the railroad baron),
originally eliminated ROTC in
1973, and the program was not
resumed after The Revolution.
"I had thought that the
program was outdated, but I was
wrong," Bruce said, explaining
his error.
On-ROTC
John Kelp, a leader of the
On-ROTC Coalition, said he was
"gratified" by Bruce's decision,
but said that Bruce "will make
the same error again when
confronted with a similar situa
tion.
"Whenever the cause of the
people is entrusted to professors,
it is lost," Kelp said, quoting
Lenin.
However, Bruce was still in
trouble with many of the stu
dents and workers at the Insti

tute over the firing of a hospital
custodian, Lyman Richards.

"Even if we have to reinstate
ROTC, we can still keep this
school for The People," Oldberry
said. "I'm afraid it might attract
more white people, though, and
that would be incorrect. But if
Bruce wants to do it, then I say
it's right on."
To further complicate the
Institute's delicate situation,
moderate students showed their
disapproval with the state of the
world two nights ago by trash
ing every window on campus,
including those in their own
dormitory rooms. They have
also threatened to re-open the
library and declassify the non-

Marxist-Leninist economics and
political theory books located in
thp locked stacks.
"We demand the right to read
all of those revisionists," declar
ed moderate student leader Wil
liam E. Miller. Miller, 67, from
Ft. Hood, Albania, told report
ers that "I've discovered that 99
percent of the time, the man's
technology is stronger than the
power of the people. But that
one time out of 100, watch
out!"
Meanwhile, left-wing stu
dents, lead by a group calling
itself the Free Campus Move
ment, have demanded the re
moval of all police from Insti
tute grounds on the basis that

the presence of law enforcement
officials "inhibits the free and
orderly expression of Marxist-
Leninist ideals."
The left-wingers also demand
ed abolition of the People's
Bomb Squad and the addition of
a People's Armory and Rifle
Range behind each dormitory.
"In order to put down the
gun, we must take up the gun,"
the group said in a statement.
"The Revolution wasn't enough;
the bureaucrats like Bruce have
taken over. It's time for a
purge."

affinity group, is girding himself
