Dear Prof. Friedenthal:
This is in reply to your letter of
April 28, 1971 asking, on behalf of
the Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter of the AAUP, for a
statement of the reasons why Profes
sor H. Bruce Franklin has been
suspended from his regular duties
under Paragraph 17 of the Statement
of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure at Stanford University.
I note first that the complaint
which prompts your inquiry comes
not from Professor Franklin but from
a group of faculty colleagues. Chap
ter II of Academic Freedom and
Tenure (a Handbook of the AAUP)
(Joughin, ed., 1969, Univ. of Wise.
Press) describes a "Model Case
Procedure" for processing charges of
denials of academic freedoms. While
the question of standing to complain
is not addressed in that description, it
speaks only to situations where the
teacher directly affected is the
complainant. I point this out not
because I want to duck the issue

presented in this case. I do not. But I
express to you my concern over
discussing a sensitive matter involving
a faculty member when the faculty
member has not joined the issue. I
can easily conceive of cases where a
faculty member would wish to have
the facts of a case involving him or
her kept confidential. In such a case I
would not reveal those facts even if
asked to do so by the AA UP on the
complaint of concerned colleagues.
This, however, is not such a case.
It has been in the public domain
since its early stages, at Professor
Franklin's initiative. In the interest
then of attempting to answer your
concerns expressed on behalf of the
AA UP I will state the facts and
reasons which led to my actions.
I proceed from an interpretation
of Paragraph 17 which agrees general
ly with yours—"that to suspend a
faculty member his alleged miscon
duct need not necessarily have arisen
directly out of his teaching or
departmental obligations. Nor is it
necessary to show that his presence
on the podium or in a classroom will
in itself be harmful." However, I
differ slightly with your position that
"the suspension must be justified on
the ground that continuation of his
regular duties .. . threatens imme
diate harm to others." [It is my view
that the suspension must be justified
on the grounds that continuation of
his regular duties would be inconsist
ent with measures taken to prevent
the threat of immediate harm to
others.]

With this understanding, let me
turn to the case at hand. While they
do not address the question of
suspension, the charges in this case (a
copy of which is attached) are
important. Paragraphs 8. 9 and 10 of
those charges allege conduct on
February 10, 1971, which constitut
ed incitement or encouragement to
actions which could lead and in some
instances did lead to harm to others.
When apprised of those allegations,
and when persuaded that they were
substantial, I was determined to seek
Professor Franklin's dismissal. But
that promised no immediate relief
from continued conduct was deter
mined therefore to seek to exclude
Professor Franklin from the campus
as the only way to maximize the
avoidance of the risk of harm to
others pending the outcome of the
hearing on the charges. But such
relief could not have been asked for
if he was at the same time expected
to continue teaching. Thus, on
February 12 I suspended Professor
Franklin from his regular duties.
Also, on February 12 the University's
attorneys initiated proceedings which
led to the issuance of an injunction
which, among other things, excludes
Professor Franklin and others from
the campus (except for limited and
specific purposes), thus minimizing
the chances of the repetition of such
conduct.
Sincerely yours,
Richard W. Lyman
President
Professor Edwin B. Parker
Dear Ed:
Since the University did not
assume or intend the material in
these letters to be of a confidential
nature, the question of whether the
Stanford Chapter of the AAUP
should release this correspondence to
the press is a matter for it, only, to
decide.
I appreciate your courtesy in
calling me on the matter.

Dear President Lyman:
We refer to the matter about
which we wrote to you on April
28th, and about which you wrote on
May 5th —namely the Franklin sus
pension.
The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter is troubled by your
response to us of May sth. The fifth
paragraph of that letter, as we
understand it, asserts that the suspen
sion was necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction; but it
really does not address itself to
whether the criteria set forth in
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment were met. In the last paragraph
of your letter you refer, but only
obliquely, to paragraphs 8 through
10 of the Charges in the case as
justification for your action under
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment.
We now request that you state
more specifically the Information
which came to your attention on
which you reached the judgment that
Professor Franklin's continued pres
ence on the campus threatened harm
to others. You will note, as we have,
from paragraph 3 of the enclosed
letter from the National AAUP, that
the substantive standard which per
mits suspension is a matter of
concern.
Yours sincerely,
Edwin B. Parker

Dear President Lyman:
We refer to the matter about
which we wrote to you on April
28th, and about which you wrote on
May 5th —namely the Franklin sus
pension.
The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter is troubled by your
response to us of May sth. The fifth
paragraph of that letter, as we
understand it, asserts that the suspen
sion was necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction; but it
really does not address itself to
whether the criteria set forth in
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment were met. In the last paragraph
of your letter you refer, but only
obliquely, to paragraphs 8 through
10 of the Charges in the case as
justification for your action under
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment.
We now request that you state
more specifically the Information
which came to your attention on
which you reached the judgment that
Professor Franklin's continued pres
ence on the campus threatened harm
to others. You will note, as we have,
from paragraph 3 of the enclosed
letter from the National AAUP, that
the substantive standard which per
mits suspension is a matter of
concern.
Yours sincerely,
Edwin B. Parker
(Editor's note: The following
letters were released today under

Dear Prof. Friedenthal:
This is in reply to your letter of
April 28, 1971 asking, on behalf of
the Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter of the AAUP, for a
statement of the reasons why Profes
sor H. Bruce Franklin has been
suspended from his regular duties
under Paragraph 17 of the Statement
of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure at Stanford University.
I note first that the complaint
which prompts your inquiry comes
not from Professor Franklin but from
a group of faculty colleagues. Chap
ter II of Academic Freedom and
Tenure (a Handbook of the AAUP)
(Joughin, ed., 1969, Univ. of Wise.
Press) describes a "Model Case
Procedure" for processing charges of
denials of academic freedoms. While
the question of standing to complain
is not addressed in that description, it
speaks only to situations where the
teacher directly affected is the
complainant. I point this out not
because I want to duck the issue

presented in this case. I do not. But I
express to you my concern over
discussing a sensitive matter involving
a faculty member when the faculty
member has not joined the issue. I
can easily conceive of cases where a
faculty member would wish to have
the facts of a case involving him or
her kept confidential. In such a case I
would not reveal those facts even if
asked to do so by the AA UP on the
complaint of concerned colleagues.
This, however, is not such a case.
It has been in the public domain
since its early stages, at Professor
Franklin's initiative. In the interest
then of attempting to answer your
concerns expressed on behalf of the
AA UP I will state the facts and
reasons which led to my actions.
I proceed from an interpretation
of Paragraph 17 which agrees general
ly with yours—"that to suspend a
faculty member his alleged miscon
duct need not necessarily have arisen
directly out of his teaching or
departmental obligations. Nor is it
necessary to show that his presence
on the podium or in a classroom will
in itself be harmful." However, I
differ slightly with your position that
"the suspension must be justified on
the ground that continuation of his
regular duties .. . threatens imme
diate harm to others." [It is my view
that the suspension must be justified
on the grounds that continuation of
his regular duties would be inconsist
ent with measures taken to prevent
the threat of immediate harm to
others.]

With this understanding, let me
turn to the case at hand. While they
do not address the question of
suspension, the charges in this case (a
copy of which is attached) are
important. Paragraphs 8. 9 and 10 of
those charges allege conduct on
February 10, 1971, which constitut
ed incitement or encouragement to
actions which could lead and in some
instances did lead to harm to others.
When apprised of those allegations,
and when persuaded that they were
substantial, I was determined to seek
Professor Franklin's dismissal. But
that promised no immediate relief
from continued conduct was deter
mined therefore to seek to exclude
Professor Franklin from the campus
as the only way to maximize the
avoidance of the risk of harm to
others pending the outcome of the
hearing on the charges. But such
relief could not have been asked for
if he was at the same time expected
to continue teaching. Thus, on
February 12 I suspended Professor

teacher directly affected is the
complainant. I point this out not
because I want to duck the issue

presented in this case. I do not. But I
express to you my concern over
discussing a sensitive matter involving
a faculty member when the faculty
member has not joined the issue. I
can easily conceive of cases where a
faculty member would wish to have
the facts of a case involving him or
her kept confidential. In such a case I
would not reveal those facts even if
asked to do so by the AA UP on the
complaint of concerned colleagues.
This, however, is not such a case.
It has been in the public domain
since its early stages, at Professor
Franklin's initiative. In the interest
then of attempting to answer your
concerns expressed on behalf of the
AA UP I will state the facts and
reasons which led to my actions.
I proceed from an interpretation
of Paragraph 17 which agrees general
ly with yours—"that to suspend a
faculty member his alleged miscon
duct need not necessarily have arisen
directly out of his teaching or
departmental obligations. Nor is it
necessary to show that his presence
on the podium or in a classroom will
in itself be harmful." However, I
differ slightly with your position that
"the suspension must be justified on
the ground that continuation of his
regular duties .. . threatens imme
diate harm to others." [It is my view
that the suspension must be justified
on the grounds that continuation of
his regular duties would be inconsist
ent with measures taken to prevent
the threat of immediate harm to
others.]

With this understanding, let me
turn to the case at hand. While they
do not address the question of
suspension, the charges in this case (a
copy of which is attached) are
important. Paragraphs 8. 9 and 10 of
those charges allege conduct on
February 10, 1971, which constitut
ed incitement or encouragement to
actions which could lead and in some
instances did lead to harm to others.
When apprised of those allegations,
and when persuaded that they were
substantial, I was determined to seek
Professor Franklin's dismissal. But
that promised no immediate relief
from continued conduct was deter
mined therefore to seek to exclude
Professor Franklin from the campus
as the only way to maximize the
avoidance of the risk of harm to
others pending the outcome of the
hearing on the charges. But such
relief could not have been asked for
if he was at the same time expected
to continue teaching. Thus, on
February 12 I suspended Professor
Franklin from his regular duties.
Also, on February 12 the University's
attorneys initiated proceedings which
led to the issuance of an injunction
which, among other things, excludes
Professor Franklin and others from
the campus (except for limited and
specific purposes), thus minimizing
the chances of the repetition of such
conduct.
Sincerely yours,
Richard W. Lyman

Dear Ed:
Since the University did not
assume or intend the material in
these letters to be of a confidential
nature, the question of whether the
Stanford Chapter of the AAUP
should release this correspondence to
the press is a matter for it, only, to
decide.
I appreciate your courtesy in
calling me on the matter.
Best regards,

Dear President Lyman:
We refer to the matter about
which we wrote to you on April
28th, and about which you wrote on
May 5th —namely the Franklin sus
pension.
The Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter is troubled by your
response to us of May sth. The fifth
paragraph of that letter, as we
understand it, asserts that the suspen
sion was necessary in order to obtain
paragraph 8 of the injunction; but it
really does not address itself to
whether the criteria set forth in
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment were met. In the last paragraph
of your letter you refer, but only
obliquely, to paragraphs 8 through
10 of the Charges in the case as
justification for your action under
paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment.
We now request that you state
more specifically the Information
which came to your attention on
which you reached the judgment that
Professor Franklin's continued pres
ence on the campus threatened harm
to others. You will note, as we have,
from paragraph 3 of the enclosed
letter from the National AAUP, that
the substantive standard which per
mits suspension is a matter of
concern.
Yours sincerely,
Edwin B. Parker
(Editor's note: The following
letters were released today under
the provision that President
Lyman's letter and Provost Mil
ler's disclaimer be printed in full.
The AA UP letter in response has
also been printed for clarity. We
apologize for the small type
which is forced by space limita
tions.)
Dear Prof. Friedenthal:
This is in reply to your letter of
April 28, 1971 asking, on behalf of
the Executive Committee of the
Stanford Chapter of the AAUP, for a
statement of the reasons why Profes
sor H. Bruce Franklin has been
suspended from his regular duties
under Paragraph 17 of the Statement
of Policy on Appointment and
Tenure at Stanford University.
I note first that the complaint
which prompts your inquiry comes
not from Professor Franklin but from
a group of faculty colleagues. Chap
ter II of Academic Freedom and
Tenure (a Handbook of the AAUP)
(Joughin, ed., 1969, Univ. of Wise.
Press) describes a "Model Case
Procedure" for processing charges of
denials of academic freedoms. While
the question of standing to complain
is not addressed in that description, it
speaks only to situations where the
teacher directly affected is the
complainant. I point this out not
because I want to duck the issue

presented in this case. I do not. But I
express to you my concern over
discussing a sensitive matter involving
a faculty member when the faculty
member has not joined the issue. I
can easily conceive of cases where a
