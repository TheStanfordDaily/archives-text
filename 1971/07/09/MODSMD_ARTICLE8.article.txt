## Child Care: Not On Campus 
### burton abrams 
(Editor's note: The following
article appeared May 5, in the
Ohio State Lantern.)
The current movement to
establish a campus child-care
center by the Women's Libera
tion gives conclusive evidence
that irrationality is not a monop
oly of the male of our species.
They are attempting to cir
cumvent the law of cause and
effect. In essence, they want to
have their cake and eat it too.
It is hard to believe that an
educated woman has no idea of
the responsibilities and difficul
ties in child rearing prior to

motherhood. Anyone who was
once a child himself should
know child rearing requires mon
etary costs in addition to costs
such as inconvenience, extra
housework, aggravation, etc.
Cost-Benefit
The decision to have children
requires weighing all these costs
against the joys. If the latter
outweighs the former, children
are a good investment for a
couple.
Apparently the crusaders for
a childcare center are unhappy
with the cost of their children.
Dropping out of school, or
refraining from pursuing a career
is now too high a cost for them.
How is it that all this was never
discussed between them and
their husbands before having
children? Regardless, they have
made a bad investment and now
wish to share the cost with
innocent bystanders.
Hence, according to Women's

Lib, children are the responsibil
ity of the society, not just the
family. As a member of society I
wish to set the record straight.
If a man buys a yacht and a
mansion and discovers he cannot
afford to make all the payments,
he generally gives one up. He
doesn't usually have the audac
ity to ask society to help in the
payments.
Utopian View
It would be of interest to see
how many of these women are
affiliated with the zero popula
tion growth movement. Passing
some of the costs associated with

having children onto "society"
makes investing in children a
better proposition. How would
these women reconcile this ap
parent conflict?
Women's Lib demonstrates a '
serious misunderstanding of real
ity in their simplistic, Utopian
view of the operation of a
business. Child-care cost to the
family will supposedly be based
on "need."
One estimate was that 200
children are now in need of a
day care center. Once this center
open, based on the principle of
need, probably 20 times this
number of the neediest little
tykes will beseige this Univer
sity. This is the expected result
when price is fixed below the
free market price.
I predict the center will be
such a huge success that classes
will be permanently scheduled
on the Oval to make room for

nurseries. Is this what we want
for Ohio State?
Worse yet, to paraphrase one
great American, "There ain't no
such thing as a free child-care
center." Who will pay? You can
be sure tuitions won't go down!
Furthermore, according to
one Women's Lib spokeswoman,
the campus center will be a place

...they cannot use
ignorance as an excuse
for having children.
to ". . bring men and women
together to care for children in
an atmosphere of love and
discovery." (What is the home
for nowadays anyway?)
How Women's Lib is going to
implement such a never-never
land program remains to be seen.
Eye-witness reports from nur
sery and elementary school
teachers cast serious doubt on
the possibility of such a pro
gram.
In conclusion, the cost of
child raising should be the
responsibility of the parents.
Most of the women supporting

this childcare center possess im
pressive education credentials.
As a consequence, they cannot
even use ignorance as an excuse
for having children. Therefore,
they themselves should reap the
harvest from the seeds they have
sown.
