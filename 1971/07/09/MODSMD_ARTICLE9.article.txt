## Brine In The Bickel Barrel 
### bill evers 
Yale Law School Professor
Alexander Bickel, who was the
New York Times' lawyer in the
recent Pentagon war study case,
was the subject of the lead story
in the July 7 issue of the Daily.
Some of Bickel's legal philoso
phy emerged in the course of the
interview. However, other as
pects of Bickel's philosophy that
deserve to be criticized are not
discussed in the Daily article.
First, it is only fair to set
forth briefly my own position. I
believe that it is one's legal duty,
in the words of the Justinian
Code, "to live honorably, to
injure no other man, and to
render to every man his due." I
believe also that men's natural
rights to life, liberty, and the
pursuit of happiness are inalien
able. That means that a person
and his creations are inviolable.
For me, this is a matter of
principle. I believe these canons
of justice to be in accord with
natural law and discoverable by
reason.
Tradition
Bickel, however, believes that
"the judicial process is too
principle-prone and principle
bound" (The Supreme Court
and the Idea of Progress). His
own position is not unlike the
empiricist conservatism of Ed
mund Burke and William F.
Buckley, Jr.:
"In dealing with problems of
great magnitude and pervasive
ramifications, problems with
complex roots and unpredict
ably multiplying offshoots—in
dealing with such problems, the
society is best [emphasis mine]
allowed to develop its own

strands out of its own tradition;
it moves forward most effective
ly, perhaps, in empirical fashion,
deploying its full tradition, in all
its contradictions, not merely
one or another self-contained
aspect of it, as it retreats and
advances, shifts and responds in
accordance with experience, and
with pressures brought to bear
by the political process."
In other words, one might
find Bickel saying, since the full
American political tradition in
cludes both slavery and emanci
pation, we should deploy the
full tradition in all its contradic
tions, rather than bringing rea
son to bear and rejecting slavery.
Alsolute Shield
Let us see how Mr. Bickel's
technique works in an actual
rather than a hypothetical case.
Consider the following passages
from the New York Times of
June 27:
"Justice [William O.] Doug
las, who is a leading adherent of
the school that considers the
First Amendment an absolute
shield to the press, perked up
when Mr. Bickel argued that the
courts might have the power to
restrain the press if Congress
passed a law specifically author
izing it. Professor Bickel is
known for his scholarly articles
arguing against Constitutional
absolutism.
" 'The First Amendment says
that Congress shall make no law
abridging the freedom of the
press,' Justice Douglas said—'Are
you saying that Congress can
make some laws abridging free
dom of the press?' He concluded
that 'it is a very strange argum

ent for the Times to make that
all this can be done if Congress
passes a law.'"
If there had been a "clearly
applicable statute," Bickel
would have been on Attorney
General John Mitchell's side
saying that restraint of the press
was constitutional and legal. (In
this hypothetical case, of course,
Mitchell and Bickel might still
disagree as to whether the New
York Times were guilty under
the statute.)

The July 3 issue of the
Saturday Review advertises in
huge letters on its front cover an
article by Carl Bakal on "The
Failure of Federal Gun Con
trol." I am glad to see that the
gun-toting government has been
unable to gain total control over
the weapons of American citi
zens.
Weapons capable of fending
off or repelling an individual
aggressor are necessary to self
defense. This is true whether or
not it is in the U.S. Constitution.
Luckily, for the liberties of
American citizens, the Constitu
tion says: "A well regulated
militia, being necessary to the
security of a free state, the right
of the people to keep and bear
arms, shall not be infringed."
The words of Theodore
Schroeder contain a concise
statement of the value of the
right to bear arms: "The obvious
import [of the Second Amend
ment] is to promote a state of
preparedness for self-defense
even against the invasions of
government, because only gov
ernments have ever disarmed any

considerable class of people as a
means toward their enslavement
. . . Here, as in the case of the
Magna Charta or our American
revolution, parchment liberties
are not long respected unless
backed up by an adequate public
opinion and physical force."
