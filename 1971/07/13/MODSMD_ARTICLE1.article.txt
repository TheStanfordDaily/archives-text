## Nelson's Home Hit By Pipe Bomb 
### 
An explosion damaged the campus
home of Robert M. Nelson, University
Director of Personnel and Employee
Relations, late last night.
The blast, "apparently caused by a
pipe bomb" according to Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Deputy Sgt. Richard
Saldivar, blew an eight inch hole in the
wall of a bedroom occupied by
Nelson's daughter. There were no
injuries to the three people at home.
Debbie Nelson. 18, was standing in
her room when the bomb hit. It
cracked plaster, moved the bed away
from the wall, and blew down a
pegboard. One bomb fragment pene
trated into the room.
Nelson, who was at home with his
wife and daughter, explained he "heard
a loud explosion and saw a ball of fire
in the yard." He said he turned on
outside lights and saw there were no
flames, and then called police.
Nelson has recently represented the
University in the controversial firing of

five workers allegedly involved in the
April 9 Hospital sit-in. He is scheduled
to testify tomorrow in the grievance
committee hearing of John Dolly, one
of the dismissed employees.
The administrator is also involved in
the University's Affirmative Action
Program for minority employment.
Nelson's home is at 695 Coronaoo
Avenue, in the heart of the faculty
residence area. The explosion occurred
at about 10:00 p.m., and was heard as
far as a mile away. A worker at the Old
Union said it sounded "like a sonic
boom."
Within minutes after the bombing,
both campus police and Santa Clara
County Sheriff's Deputies responded to
Nelson's call. The FBI and Treasury
agents entered the case shortly thereaf
ter.
In addition to damaging the bed
room, the bomb blew another eight
inch hole in the hollow concrete w; II
opposite the bedroom. A wooden fence

between the bedroom and wall was
shattered.
The composition of the bomb and
whether it had been planted or thrown
from a passing vehicle could not be
immediately determined.
After visiting the Nelson home
around midnight last night, Provost
William Miller commented, "What can 1
say? It was a terrorist and senseless act.
The reaction of the University com
munity can be only one of anger and
determination to do everything in our
power to assist in the investigation and
to bring to an end outrageous acts of
this kind."
