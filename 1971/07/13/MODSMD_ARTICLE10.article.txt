# Ailey Dancers In At Flint
## 
### 
One of America's pre-eminent
and innovative creators in the
field of modern dance will open a
two-night program tonight at 8:30
at the new Flint Center at DeAnza
College. The Alvin Ailey Ameri
can Dance Theater Company
recently returned to the United
States from a successful tour of
Europe and the Soviet Union and
is bolstered by strong new talent
and a controversial addition to the
repertoire called simply "Flow
ers.
Tonight's program will include
"Flowers," Ailey's rock ballet
based on the life and death of
Janis Joplin with music scored by
Pink Floyd and Blind Faith. From
the Southern Comfort to a black
clad and spectral figure of death

as a Tempter, Ailey has sought to
capture some of the explosive
aspects of Janis' career.
Also on the program tonight
are "Streams," choreographed in
ventions by Ailey, using music by
Miroslav Kabelac and "Revela
tions," generally regarded as a
personal tour de force for Ailey as
a choreographer and a seminal
artistic statement about the cul
tural and emotional heritage of
Black America. In any Ailey
production in which it is perform
ed, it invariably appears last.
Tomorrow night's program in
cludes "Dance for Six," with a
Vivaldi score, "Cry," a jazz dance,
"Choral Dances," using Benjamin
Britten's "Gloriana," and a repeat
of "Revelations."

The Ailey Company is only the
third professional group booked
into the new performing center in
Cupertino, located on the DeAnza
campus near Stelling Road and
Stevens Creek Blvd.
Student rush tickets will be
available at the door tonight and
tomorrow for only $2.50 with
student ID. Rush tickets go on
sale at 7:30, an hour prior to
curtain but the wait is worth it.

ing this weekend, July 16,17 and
18 at Zellerbach Auditorium in
Berkeley including 2:00 p.m.
matinees on Saturday and Sun
