# Preservation Hall Band Is Alive And Well
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
The world lost a great person
last week when the grand master
of jazz, Louis Armstrong, died in
New York. In his 71 years
Armstrong had used his horn to
bridge the kind of cultural gaps
which very few men have been
able to overcome. They loved
Louis almost anywhere he went.
Louis took with him probably
the greatest trumpet talent jazz
music has ever, and will ever
know. His style was unique but
the kind of music he blew out of
his horn hasn't gone. I'm happy to
report that it was alive and well in
Berkeley on Saturday night and
will continue to be so this week at
Stanford.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band has returned here for the
fifth time in five summers. And as
sure as they have done it every
time before, they will enrich a few
more audiences with a taste of a
truly American art form.
New Orleans Bred
As everyone knows, Armstrong
left the alleys of New Orleans in
his early life. And before he
passed away last week he had

travelled in every state and almost
every major country. Others
weren't so lucky.
Some of the truly great jazz
musicians never got out of New
Orleans. The other musicians and
the jazz connoisseurs knew who
the great ones were, but for too
long America overlooked some of
the masters.
Fortunately, in recent years,
some people have wanted to share
the treasures of true New Orleans
jazz with other parts of America.
One such person was Allan Jaffe,
a portly white tuba player, who in
1961 with his wife Sandra, found
ed Preservation Hall to provide a
showplace for the old time New
Orleans jazz.
Jaffe can be thanked foi
making appearances like this
week's possible. He gave De De
and Billie Pierce a chance to gain
recognition once again. Billie and
De De were both slowed by ill
health in the 50's. But in the 60'5
they started up again and they are
still playing today.
Billie Injured
Unfortunately, Billie recently
broke her hip and will not be
playing during the band's Stan
ford engagement. She is replaced
by James Edward "Sing" Miller,
who does a more than adequate
job of filling in.
The rest of the band remains
intact. Trombonists Jim Robinson
is now an octagenarian, but you
would never know it from the
way he is still blowing his horn
and fooling around with the
audience.
Willie Humphrey's talent and
midriff are both still ample and he
is now recognized as one of the
finest living New Orleans jazz
clarinetist.
Cie Frazier non-chalantly
works on the drums, and now and
then he still winds up for a
fast-paced solo. Tuba player Jaffe
and banjoist Frank Demond add a
younger, background.
Leader Of The Band
But De De Pierce is still the
leader of the band. The remark
able blind trumpet player hasn't
lost any of the talent which has
put him among the finest of the
old school. He looks a little greyer
and more tired, but like Louis and
the rest of the greats, he'll be
blowing as long as he possibly can.

Together these remarkable peo
ple compose a living time capsule
of one of the truly beautiful parts
of our culture's past. Disregarding
Jaffe and Frank Demond the
average age of the band members
hovers around the 70 mark.
But if you close your eyes, you
would never know it. Their music
is timeless and it sounds like it
probably did when they were a lot
younger. If you close your eyes
while listening to them, you mind
will probably drift off to the old
New Orleans as you would picture
it.
Gestalt
It's almost impossible to dissect
the music instrument by instru
ment, or song by song. It's a total
experience. Words are sometimes
part of it. .. "Sing's" singing is
great in the old honky-tonk piano
type blues and De De's gravelly
old voice is equally fitting in
either Gumbo dialect or English.
The others sing a song or two, but
it is their instruments which do
most of the "singing."
The music can move from the
deepest sorrow to the wildest joy
and back again in a few minutes.
It may be cliched to say it, but
words can't describe the joy and
sorrow each instrument can so
perfectly express in the hands of
these ancient masters. Take my
word though, their music works.
The people in Berkeley loved
it. But who wouldn't. The audi
ence reflects the emotions of the
music perfectly. One moment
they'd be swaying and jumping
and the next they'd sit quiet and
sad-faced.
Classic Jazz
The songs they play are almost
all classic jazz numbers. Such
nostalgic old tunes as "St. James
Infirmary," "Freight Train
Blues," "Put On That Old Grey
Bonnet," and "Let Me Call You
Sweetheart" are among their wide
repertoire. Fittingly they ended
Saturday night's show with a
spirited rendition of "When the
Saints. . . "
Let by Humphrey and Robin
son, almost a hundred members of
the audience wound their way
around the edges of Hertz Hall.
The parade ended back on the
stage, with five minutes of unre
strained dancing. But after all the
joy and sorrow, no one left
without a smile. That's what
music is all about.

STILL BLOWlNG—Although most of the members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band are eligible for
Medicare, they are still playing way below their years. The three musicians here, trombonist Jim Robinson,
trumpetist De De Pierce and clarinetist Willie Humphrey are all recognized as among the best New Orleans
jazz performers with their respective instruments. The band will be appearing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
nightly at 8 :00 p.m. from tonight through Saturday. There will be an extra 10:00 p.m. show on Friday night
and all tickets will be $3.50 general and $2.75 for students.

Jaffe can be thanked foi
making appearances like this
week's possible. He gave De De
and Billie Pierce a chance to gain
recognition once again. Billie and
De De were both slowed by ill
health in the 50's. But in the 60'5
they started up again and they are
still playing today.
Billie Injured
Unfortunately, Billie recently
broke her hip and will not be
playing during the band's Stan
ford engagement. She is replaced
by James Edward "Sing" Miller,
who does a more than adequate
job of filling in.
The rest of the band remains
intact. Trombonists Jim Robinson
is now an octagenarian, but you
would never know it from the
way he is still blowing his horn
and fooling around with the
audience.
Willie Humphrey's talent and
midriff are both still ample and he
is now recognized as one of the
finest living New Orleans jazz
clarinetist.
Cie Frazier non-chalantly
works on the drums, and now and
then he still winds up for a
fast-paced solo. Tuba player Jaffe
and banjoist Frank Demond add a
younger, background.
Leader Of The Band
But De De Pierce is still the
leader of the band. The remark
able blind trumpet player hasn't
lost any of the talent which has
put him among the finest of the
old school. He looks a little greyer
and more tired, but like Louis and
the rest of the greats, he'll be
blowing as long as he possibly can.

Together these remarkable peo
ple compose a living time capsule
of one of the truly beautiful parts
of our culture's past. Disregarding
Jaffe and Frank Demond the
average age of the band members
hovers around the 70 mark.
But if you close your eyes, you
would never know it. Their music
is timeless and it sounds like it
probably did when they were a lot
younger. If you close your eyes
while listening to them, you mind
will probably drift off to the old
New Orleans as you would picture
it.
Gestalt
It's almost impossible to dissect
the music instrument by instru
ment, or song by song. It's a total
experience. Words are sometimes
part of it. .. "Sing's" singing is
great in the old honky-tonk piano
type blues and De De's gravelly
old voice is equally fitting in
either Gumbo dialect or English.
The others sing a song or two, but
it is their instruments which do
most of the "singing."
The music can move from the
deepest sorrow to the wildest joy
and back again in a few minutes.
It may be cliched to say it, but
words can't describe the joy and
sorrow each instrument can so
perfectly express in the hands of
these ancient masters. Take my
word though, their music works.
The people in Berkeley loved
it. But who wouldn't. The audi
ence reflects the emotions of the
music perfectly. One moment
they'd be swaying and jumping
and the next they'd sit quiet and
sad-faced.
Classic Jazz
The songs they play are almost
all classic jazz numbers. Such
nostalgic old tunes as "St. James
Infirmary," "Freight Train
Blues," "Put On That Old Grey
Bonnet," and "Let Me Call You
Sweetheart" are among their wide
repertoire. Fittingly they ended
Saturday night's show with a
spirited rendition of "When the
Saints. . . "
Let by Humphrey and Robin
son, almost a hundred members of
the audience wound their way
around the edges of Hertz Hall.
The parade ended back on the
stage, with five minutes of unre
strained dancing. But after all the
joy and sorrow, no one left
without a smile. That's what
music is all about.

STILL BLOWlNG—Although most of the members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band are eligible for
Medicare, they are still playing way below their years. The three musicians here, trombonist Jim Robinson,
trumpetist De De Pierce and clarinetist Willie Humphrey are all recognized as among the best New Orleans
jazz performers with their respective instruments. The band will be appearing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
nightly at 8 :00 p.m. from tonight through Saturday. There will be an extra 10:00 p.m. show on Friday night
and all tickets will be $3.50 general and $2.75 for students.
The world lost a great person
last week when the grand master
of jazz, Louis Armstrong, died in
New York. In his 71 years
Armstrong had used his horn to
bridge the kind of cultural gaps
which very few men have been
able to overcome. They loved
Louis almost anywhere he went.
Louis took with him probably
the greatest trumpet talent jazz
music has ever, and will ever
know. His style was unique but
the kind of music he blew out of
his horn hasn't gone. I'm happy to
report that it was alive and well in
Berkeley on Saturday night and
will continue to be so this week at
Stanford.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band has returned here for the
fifth time in five summers. And as
sure as they have done it every
time before, they will enrich a few
more audiences with a taste of a
truly American art form.
New Orleans Bred
As everyone knows, Armstrong
left the alleys of New Orleans in
his early life. And before he
passed away last week he had

travelled in every state and almost
every major country. Others
weren't so lucky.
Some of the truly great jazz
musicians never got out of New
Orleans. The other musicians and
the jazz connoisseurs knew who
the great ones were, but for too
long America overlooked some of
the masters.
Fortunately, in recent years,
some people have wanted to share
the treasures of true New Orleans
jazz with other parts of America.
One such person was Allan Jaffe,
a portly white tuba player, who in
1961 with his wife Sandra, found
ed Preservation Hall to provide a
showplace for the old time New
Orleans jazz.
Jaffe can be thanked foi
making appearances like this

hovers around the 70 mark.
But if you close your eyes, you
would never know it. Their music
is timeless and it sounds like it
probably did when they were a lot
younger. If you close your eyes
while listening to them, you mind
will probably drift off to the old
New Orleans as you would picture
it.
Gestalt
It's almost impossible to dissect
the music instrument by instru
ment, or song by song. It's a total
experience. Words are sometimes
part of it. .. "Sing's" singing is
great in the old honky-tonk piano
type blues and De De's gravelly
old voice is equally fitting in
either Gumbo dialect or English.
The others sing a song or two, but
it is their instruments which do
most of the "singing."
The music can move from the
deepest sorrow to the wildest joy
and back again in a few minutes.
It may be cliched to say it, but
words can't describe the joy and
sorrow each instrument can so
perfectly express in the hands of
these ancient masters. Take my
word though, their music works.
The people in Berkeley loved
it. But who wouldn't. The audi
ence reflects the emotions of the
music perfectly. One moment
they'd be swaying and jumping
and the next they'd sit quiet and
sad-faced.
Classic Jazz
The songs they play are almost
all classic jazz numbers. Such
nostalgic old tunes as "St. James
Infirmary," "Freight Train
Blues," "Put On That Old Grey
Bonnet," and "Let Me Call You
Sweetheart" are among their wide
repertoire. Fittingly they ended
Saturday night's show with a
spirited rendition of "When the
Saints. . . "
Let by Humphrey and Robin
son, almost a hundred members of
the audience wound their way
around the edges of Hertz Hall.
The parade ended back on the
stage, with five minutes of unre
strained dancing. But after all the
joy and sorrow, no one left
without a smile. That's what
music is all about.

STILL BLOWlNG—Although most of the members of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band are eligible for
Medicare, they are still playing way below their years. The three musicians here, trombonist Jim Robinson,
trumpetist De De Pierce and clarinetist Willie Humphrey are all recognized as among the best New Orleans
jazz performers with their respective instruments. The band will be appearing in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
nightly at 8 :00 p.m. from tonight through Saturday. There will be an extra 10:00 p.m. show on Friday night
and all tickets will be $3.50 general and $2.75 for students.
The world lost a great person
last week when the grand master
of jazz, Louis Armstrong, died in
New York. In his 71 years
Armstrong had used his horn to
bridge the kind of cultural gaps
which very few men have been
able to overcome. They loved
Louis almost anywhere he went.
Louis took with him probably
the greatest trumpet talent jazz
music has ever, and will ever
know. His style was unique but
the kind of music he blew out of
his horn hasn't gone. I'm happy to
report that it was alive and well in
Berkeley on Saturday night and
will continue to be so this week at
Stanford.
The Preservation Hall Jazz
Band has returned here for the
fifth time in five summers. And as
sure as they have done it every
time before, they will enrich a few
more audiences with a taste of a
truly American art form.
New Orleans Bred
As everyone knows, Armstrong
left the alleys of New Orleans in
his early life. And before he
passed away last week he had

travelled in every state and almost
every major country. Others
weren't so lucky.
Some of the truly great jazz
musicians never got out of New
Orleans. The other musicians and
the jazz connoisseurs knew who
the great ones were, but for too
long America overlooked some of
the masters.
Fortunately, in recent years,
some people have wanted to share
the treasures of true New Orleans
jazz with other parts of America.
One such person was Allan Jaffe,
a portly white tuba player, who in
1961 with his wife Sandra, found
ed Preservation Hall to provide a
showplace for the old time New
Orleans jazz.
Jaffe can be thanked foi
making appearances like this
week's possible. He gave De De
and Billie Pierce a chance to gain
recognition once again. Billie and
De De were both slowed by ill
health in the 50's. But in the 60'5
they started up again and they are
still playing today.
Billie Injured
Unfortunately, Billie recently
broke her hip and will not be
playing during the band's Stan
ford engagement. She is replaced
by James Edward "Sing" Miller,
who does a more than adequate
job of filling in.
The rest of the band remains
intact. Trombonists Jim Robinson
is now an octagenarian, but you
would never know it from the
way he is still blowing his horn
and fooling around with the
audience.
Willie Humphrey's talent and
midriff are both still ample and he
is now recognized as one of the
finest living New Orleans jazz
clarinetist.
Cie Frazier non-chalantly
works on the drums, and now and
then he still winds up for a
fast-paced solo. Tuba player Jaffe
and banjoist Frank Demond add a
younger, background.
Leader Of The Band
But De De Pierce is still the
leader of the band. The remark
able blind trumpet player hasn't
lost any of the talent which has
put him among the finest of the
old school. He looks a little greyer
and more tired, but like Louis and
the rest of the greats, he'll be
blowing as long as he possibly can.

Together these remarkable peo
ple compose a living time capsule
of one of the truly beautiful parts
of our culture's past. Disregarding
Jaffe and Frank Demond the
average age of the band members
hovers around the 70 mark.
But if you close your eyes, you
would never know it. Their music
is timeless and it sounds like it
probably did when they were a lot

will probably drift off to the old
