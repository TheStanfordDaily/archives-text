Following is the complete text of correspondence between
the Executive Committee of the Stanford chapter of the
American Association of University Professors and the Presi
dent's Office concerning the suspension of Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin. Through typographical errors and space limita

versions published by The Daily.
April 28, 1971
Dear President Lyman:
The Executive Committee of the Stanford Chapter of the
American Association of University Professors, at its meeting
on April 20, 1971, discussed at some length the suspension of
Professor H. Bruce Franklin. This discussion was generated in
part on the initiative of the members of the Executive Com
mittee themselves and in part on a formal complaint by a
group of our colleagues who challenge the propriety of your
actions.
The Executive Committee unanimously decided as follows:
a. That the standard to be applied in judging your actions
is not whether any one of us would have taken the same step
which you have taken but whether or not any reasonable man
acting as President of the University could have found that the
continuation of Professor Franklin in his normal duties con
stituted a threat of harm to others.
b. That the Executive Committee does not have at its
disposal an appropriate statement of reasons as to why you
suspended Professor Franklin. We are aware that from time to
time you have made statements regarding this matter to the
Faculty Senate and elsewhere, but there has been no detailed
statement made to the faculty at large. The formal complaint
referred to above was based upon your statement of February
26 to the Advisory Board, a statement which was not pri
marily directed to the matter of suspension.
c. That in order that we can make an appropriate evalua
tion, we request that at your earliest convenience you submit
to us in writing a statement of your reasons for ordering the
suspension.
All of us on the Executive Committee are acutely aware of
the difficult decisions that you face with regard to this type of
disciplinary matter. We also realize that the situation is a
difficult one, since trial on the basic charges is pending before
the Advisory Board. Yet, the suspension is a separate matter
which must be dealt with and justified on its own merits.
Standards of conduct developed by the National AAUP make
clear that temporary suspension is an extraordinary remedy to
be utilized only when absolutely essential.
Subsequent to our Executive Committee meeting, 1 was
handed a copy of your response, dated April 16, 1971, to
those faculty members who had petitioned you to lift the
suspension. Many of those same faculty members are spon
soring the AAUP complaint. Your response, at least as I read
it, does not clearly answer the objections that have been put
forth. I agree with you, as I believe most faculty members do,
that to suspend a faculty member, his alleged misconduct need
not necessarily have arisen directly out of his teaching or
departmental obligations. Nor is it necessary to show that his
presence on the podium in a classroom will in itself be harm
ful. The problem is that the suspension must be justified on
the ground that continuation now of his regular duties, in your
opinion, threatens immediate harm to others. We would like
you to specify the grounds for your view that temporary
suspension is the appropriate action.
Jack H. Friedenthal
Professor of Law and
President, Stanford Chapter of AAUP
May 5, 1971
Dear Professor Friedenthal:
This is in reply to your letter of April 28, 1971, asking, on
behalf of the Executive Committee of the Stanford Chapter of
the AAUP, for a statement of the reasons why Professor H.
Bruce Franklin has been suspended from his regular duties
under Paragraph 17 of the Statement of Policy on Appoint
ment and Tenure at Stanford University.
1 note first that the complaint which prompts your inquiry
comes not from Professor Franklin but from a group of
faculty colleagues. Chapter II of Academic Freedom and
Tenure (a Handbook of the AAUP) (Joughin, ed., 1969, Univ.
of Wise. Press) describes a "Model Case Procedure" for proc
essing charges of denials of academic freedoms. While the
question of standing to complain is not addressed in that
description, it speaks only to situations where the teacher
directly affected is the complainant. I point this out not
because I want to duck the issue presented in this case. I do
not. But I express to you my concern over discussing a
sensitive matter involving a faculty member when the faculty
member has not joined the issue. I can easily conceive of cases
where a faculty member would wish to have the tacts of a case
involving him or her kept confidential. In such a case I would
not reveal those facts even if asked to do so by the AAUP on
the complaint of concerned colleagues.
This, however, is not such a case. It has been in the public
domain since its early stages, at Professor Franklin's initiative.
In the interest then of attempting to answer your concerns
expressed on behalf of the AAUP I will state the facts and
reasons which led to my actions.
1 proceed from an interpretation of Paragraph 17 which
agrees generally with yours "that to suspend a faculty mem
ber his alleged misconduct need not necessarily have arisen
directly out of his teaching or departmental obligations. Nor is
it necessary to show that his presence on the podium or in a
classroom will in itself be harmful." However, I differ slightly
with your position that "the suspension must be justified on
the ground that continuation of his regular duties. . .threatens
immediate harm to others." It is my view that the suspension
must be justified on the grounds that continuation of his
regular duties would be inconsistent with measures taken to
prevent the threat of immediate harm to others.
With this understanding, let me turn to the case at hand.
While they do not address the question of suspension, the
charges in this case (a copy of which is attached) are impor
tant. Paragraphs 8. 4 and 10 of those charges allege conduct on
February 10, 1971, which constituted incitement or en
couragement to actions which could lead and in some in-

stances did lead to harm to others. When apprised of those
allegations, and when persuaded that they were substantial, I
was determined to seek Professor Franklin's dismissal. But that
promised no immediate relief from continued conduct on his
part of the sort which threatens harm to others. 1 was deter
mined therefore to seek to exclude Professor Franklin from
the campus as the only way to maximize the avoidance of the
risk of harm to others pending the outcome of the hearing on
the charges. But such relief could not have been asked for if he
was at the same time expected to continue teaching. Thus, on
February 12 1 suspended Professor Franklin from his regular
duties. Also, on February 12 the University's attorneys
initiated proceedings which led to the issuance of an injunc
tion which, among other things, excludes Professor Franklin
and others from the campus (except for limited and specific
purposes), thus minimizing the chances of the repetition of
such conduct.
Richard W. Lyman
President
June 28, 1971
Dear President Lyman:
We refer to the matter about which we wrote to you on
April 28th, and about which you wrote on May sth-namely
the Franklin suspension. You observed in your letter that our
standing in the matter was clouded by the fact that we had no
request for assistance from Professor Franklin. We have now
received such a request. His request to the local organization
was made by telephone; he has also submitted a written
request to the National organization. A recently received cor
respondence, so indicating, is enclosed.
The Executive Committee of the Stanford Chapter is trou
bled by your response to us of May sth. The fifth paragraph of
that letter, as we understand it, asserts that the suspension was
necessary in order to obtain paragraph 8 of the injunction; but
it really does not address itself to whether the criteria set forth
in paragraph 17 of the Tenure Statement were met. In the last
paragraph of your letter you refer, but only obliquely, to
paragraphs 8 through 10 of the Charges in the case as justifica
tion for your action under paragraph 17 of the Tenure State
ment.
We now request that you state more specifically the infor
mation which came to your attention on which you reached
the judgment that Professor Franklin's continued presence on
the campus threatened harm to others. You will note, as we
have, from paragraph 3 of the enclosed letter from the Na
tional AAUP, that the substantive standard which permits
suspension is a matter of concern. If, for example, you know
that faculty observers are prepared to testify that Professor
Franklin explicitly urged participants in the Computation
Center disruption to disregard orders to disperse, we would be
grateful to be so advised. Or, if there was some other basis of
an analogous nature that led you to reach your judgment
pursuant to paragraph 17, we would like to be informed of
that.
Edwin B. Parker
Acting President
Stanford AAUP Chapter
(For the Executive Committee)
July 2, 1971
Dear Ed:
In the absence of President Lyman 1 have received your
letter to him dated June 28th asking for more specific infor
mation concerning his judgment that, "Professor Franklin's
continued presence on the campus threatened harm to
others."
I find myself in the position that I cannot provide this
material myself. It clearly requires a response from President
Lyman and not from me. President Lyman is on a business
trip, including some vacation, and will not return to the
campus until August 9th.
I am even further handicapped at the present time in that
our legal counsel, Mr. James Siena, who might be able to
provide some information is on vacation. The absence of this
counsel prevents me from being able to give even a preliminary
response. I would note that there is some precedent in this
case that the absence of counsel is sufficient cause for delay.
1 would note further that President Lyman does not have
his files and notes which could serve as a reminder to him of
the considerations and judgments that he was exercising. I
would believe that the unavailability of these materials would
put him in a position of giving an inadequate response from
afar.
Let me also note that there has been a considerable lapse of
time between President Lyman's letter of May sth and your
new inquiry of June 28th. 1 also note that you have received
more recent correspondence from Professor Franklin and the
National AAUP.
My present plan, therefore, would be to call this to his
immediate attention on his return on August 9th. I am sorry
that I am presently not in the position to do more than that.
