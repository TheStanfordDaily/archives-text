# Farm Union Celebrates
## 
### TOM FRICKE Commentary 
Clad in hip-gypsy garb, brown
berets, and Manila workshirts, over
10,000 came to occupy San Jose's
Spartan stadium, for an afternoon
called "Fiesta Campesina." Six months
of anxious preparations, organizing
performers, speakers, technicians, and
of course the audience, had payed off
in financial dividends to Cesar Chavez'

United Farm Workers Organizing Com
mittee (UFWOC).
The performers—including an in
tense but smiling Joan Baez, Cal Tjader
and his fiery Latin jazz, melodic
Mexican mariachis, and a well-received
raunchy-rock group called Redwing
emanated an air of celebration. The
exhortations, an imprompty surprise
speech by Cesar himself, and David
Harris' high-powered attack on the
"System" blended in well with wine,
dope, and the tamales and guacamole
sold at the concession stands.
Bill Stopped
And the Farm Workers' supporters
had reasons for rejoicing. The farm
workers—through avalanches of letters,
a constant stream of phone calls, and
an emotional rally on the steps of the
Capitol in Sacramento last Wednes
day—had caused a bill by Orange
County Democrat Ken Covey to die a
natural death in committee.

This piece of legislation would have
stopped the consumer boycott, stifled
field picketing, striking and bargaining
and placed labor relations under the
control of a Reagan
With this success, UFWOC could now
go full-force into its boycott of
Heublein products—ltalian Swiss Col
ony Wines, Smirnoff Vodka, and
Hamm's Beer-which refuses to allow
its grape pickers to unionize.
Annual Event
Organizer Jim Cassell plans to make
the Fiesta an annual event. The
movement which began in force in the
Delano grape huelga of 1966 and has its
roots in the discontent and struggle for
dignity of Chicano, Philippino, Arab,
Oriental, Black and white farm workers
has matured and grown in strength.
Cesar Chavez told the benefit, "There is
always talk about the great wealth of
this country. Well, we're the wealth,
remember that."
