# Campus Hosts Sixty Summer Workshops
## 
### DICK GEIKIE 
Don't be surprised if you run into an
Australian bookseller on campus this
summer. He's a Stanford student, at
least for a few days. And so are experts
on gymnastics, fossil dinoflagellates and
sixty other fields being studied in
summer conferences and workshops.
Groups from all fifty states and
many foreign countries converge every
summer to make use of Stanford's
meeting rooms, dorms, and swimming
pools.
Conferences range in length from
three days to ten weeks, with most
using Stanford housing and food
services.
Mrs. Lois Fariello, Conference Di
rector, said "The only requirements
necessary 7 for a group to meet at
Stanford are that the topic must be
educational, and a professor and the

respective department must sponsor the
group," but added, "the Presidents
Office has the final say."
Stanford receives room and board
fees from the groups attending, with
the profits being turned back into
housing and campus improvements.
Mrs. Fariello explained the
$201,000 earned last summer paid no
more tiian a summer-sized portion of
such fixed maintenance costs as dormi
tory insurance and renovation.
"Many benefits are derived from
having these groups at Stanford," said
Mrs. Fariello. "Besides keeping our
cooking and maintenance staff employ
ed through the summer, we have
experts in many fields here on campus,
with some returning as guest lecturers
or professors. Many young people also
return to Stanford as students after
seeing the campus during high school
workshops."

GLUB, GLUBâ€”"Catcher in the Rye's" Molden Caulfield kept wondering where the Central Park ducks go in winter. The
ducks at our own Lake Lagunita disappear every summer and take the whole lake with them. From October to May, Lake
Lag follows the mystic order of the University's water rights and is filled from the overflow of San Francisquito Creek. When
that source dries for summer so does the Lake, with a little mechanized help in removing leftover slosh. Fill Lag for summer?
Superintendent of Roads and Grounds Perry B. Hackett said it could be filled from the Searsville or Felt Lake, but these 1
"were constructed mainly for the purpose of furnishing irrigation waters" for the campus.
