# Panther Split Precipitates Division In Venceremos

Venceremos, perhaps the largest revolutionary organiza
tion on the Peninsula, is in the process of splitting into two
smaller groups, the Daily has learned. The split will
apparently have a direct effect 011 the group's organization
and activities on the Stanford campus.
The split apparently revolves around the leadership and
policies of two popular campus figures, suspended
Associate Professor of English H. Bruce Franklin, and
Miriam Cherry, who works on campus in association with
the Roman Catholic Newman Center in Palo Alto.
Cherry has close ties with the Oakland (Huey
Newton-David Milliard) Black Panther organization. Ac
cording to sources close to Venceremos, Cherry has held a
"leadership position" on campus recently, and has become
increasingly important since Franklin's suspension in
February.
Franklin, on the other hand, apparently leans toward
the New York-Algiers (Eldridge Cleaver) faction of the
Panthers, and, according to reliable reports, has criticized
Venceremos' organizing on bread and butter issues around
the fired Tresidder and Hospital Center workers. He
apparently would have preferred to organize around the
broader issues of the Indochina War and the "united front
against fascism and imperialism."
John Kaman, a graduate student in English who has just
quit Venceremos and shares many of Cherry's criticisms,
also believes the organizing of campus employees was too
much on bread and butter issues rather than on political
issues. Apparently the dispute in this sphere of activity
between the Venceremos leadership and those who are
leaving is over whether the concentration on economic
issues was the fault of those who were in charge locally
(and are now leaving Venceremos) or the fault of too strict
guidelines imposed from the outside by the Venceremos
leadership.
Split Predictable
The split, which some observers have been predicting
since the Panther split emerged some months ago, came to
a head late last week. While it is not known how many
"cadre" Venceremos has on campus, it appears that
between one-third and one-half of the on-campus group

will leave the present Venceremos organization.
| Venceremos, which has headquarters in Redwood City,
is active from San Francisco to San Jose. Its overall
membership, including "open" (public) and "closed"
(non-public) members, is variously estimated between 400
and 1000.
[Most of the Stanford-based members of the group
joined in December when they split from another
organization, the Revolutionary Union (RU), centered in
the East Bay.]
At one point, the in-fighting became so intense within
Venceremos that veiled threats of physical violence were
made.
No Comment
The present Venceremos leadership has repeatedly
declined to discuss the split with the Daily on the grounds
that the situation is still in flux.
However, the Daily was able to talk with a number of
people who have worked with Venceremos this year,
including many of those who now are leaving.
Duringa discussion with Cherry, she accused the present
Venceremos leadership, including Franklin, of "left
opportunism," of distorting the "united front against
imperialism," and of worshipping "cult" heroes such as
Cleaver.
She said that the prevalence of these tendencies in the
organization has led to an emphasis on the importance of
recruiting street-fighters rather than people with a greater
political and theoretical orientation.
Lumpen Leanings
The present organization, she said, is inclined overmuch
towards a constituency of "lumpen" and "street gangs."
She said that the present Venceremos leadership tends
toward a "cult" worship of certain progressive leaders (like
Cleaver) who have reached a "higher" level of political
understanding than most other people. Because of this, she
said, there is a tendency to lose sight of the fact that the
majority of the people—and not just their leaders—will
make the revolution.
Another person who has left Venceremos for analogous
reasons commented: "If people's practice were as advanced
as the Venceremos leadership thinks it is, a lot more pig
stations would be being attacked in Redwood City."
Cherry and others strongly support
the Oakland Black Panther Party,
whose position the Venceremos Central
Committee recently found to be
unconscionable. The "survival" pro
grams and welfare rights advocacy of
the Oakland Panthers, according to
Cherry, are designed to unite black
people and thus enable them to throw
off institutional oppression. In sharp
contrast with the present Venceremos
position, she felt that there is no reason
to brandish guns prematurely.
Cadre Depart
She pointed out that the Oakland
Panthers, while continuing to relate to
a black community which understands
questions of guns and self-defense, have

come to recognize how an exaggerated
gun motif and armed confrontation
have the effect of bringing more police
into black areas.
Cherry also noted that the organiza
tion at Stanford has been "depressed"
because of the departure of some of the
most highly-valued cadre. Another
person noted the departure of three
members of Venceremos' old Central
Committee.
Some observers have pointed out
that, although the exact lines and size
of the split are not yet apparent, the
Franklin group may have trouble
working with the Stanford Black
Students' Union leadership, since The
Real News recently came out with a
strong statement in support of the
Oakland Panthers in its July 8 issue.
