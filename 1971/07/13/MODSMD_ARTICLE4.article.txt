# McCloskey Begins At Home
## 
### VICKI PERRIS 
Congressman Paul N. (Pete) McClos
key (Rep., Calif.) came home last
weekend to begin his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination in
1972.
McCloskey's strong opposition to
the Vietnam war and his clashes with

President Nixon concerning war policy
are major issues in the initial stages of
his campaign. McCloskey spoke at
several locations in San Mateo, and was
asked repeatedly by different audiences
about his stand against the Vietnam
war. McCloskey stated that he believes
. . 70 percent of the reason that the
United States is still entangled in the
war is to avoid humiliation . . . and a
blow to our reputation as guarantor."
He accused the relationship between
Congress and the Defense Department
as being "riddled with deceit" and said
that Congress is like "an ostrich, hiding
it's head in the sand."
After the Pentagon papers had been
published, McCloskey and several of his
colleagues urged Congress to pastf a bill
ordering the Defense Department to
tell Congress exactly what actions are
being taken in Southeast Asia. The
motion was voted down, 118 to 236.
"Congress has failed the American
people by not demanding this informa
tion," McCloskey commented. "They
have, in effect, asked not to be told the
truth. However, the 118 votes is
probably 100 more than we would have
had one year ago."
The proposed Lockheed loan
brought many questions from McClos
key's followers. Early in the day at the
Probe Community Center in Kedwood
City, McCloskey, speaking in front of a
predominantly black and Chicano audi
ence, said he "tended to be against
backing the loan, but providing jobs is a
major issue, and Lockheed does this."
But later on in the day at several other
locations, the Congressman stated that
lie plans to vote against the loan
entirely.

In his whirlwind local campaign,
McCloskey condemned the present
inconsistancies in the welfare system.
According to McCloskey, because each
state decides how much a welfare
recipient will be allotted, the majority
of welfare recipients move to the states
with the highest allotment. McCloskey
favors trying to "federalize" the wel
fare system, and thus bring financial
relief to those few states.
Speaking in downtown Palo Alto,
McCloskey was questioned by a pro
ponent of women's rights. Asked about
his recent vote against a bill that would
provide more rights for women,
McCloskey justified his negative vote
on the grounds that ". .. providing
equal rights for women would also give
them greater responsibilities, such as
subjection to the draft. . He took
the questions lightly and a few
moments later announced that he

would not enjoy sharing a latrine with a
woman.
Congressman McCloskey believes
that the recent amendment allowing
18-year-olds to vote could mean "the
death of the Republican Party," as
most of the newly eligible voters are
expected to register as Democrats.
Several times, McCloskey urged those
present to register if they had not done
so already and to register as Republi
cans. Several registrars were on hand to
accomodate new voters.
"I would like to stay in Congress,"
McCloskey stated, "but couldn't find
anyone else who would run against
President Nixon."
Although the Congressman terms his
chances of winning the presidential
nomination "remote," he hopes that
his actions might push President Nixon
toward ending the war.

that the recent amendment allowing

most of the newly eligible voters are

Several times, McCloskey urged those
present to register if they had not done
so already and to register as Republi

accomodate new voters.
"I would like to stay in Congress,"
McCloskey stated, "but couldn't find

chances of winning the presidential
nomination "remote," he hopes that

Congressman Paul N. (Pete) McClos
key (Rep., Calif.) came home last
weekend to begin his campaign for the
Republican presidential nomination in
1972.
McCloskey's strong opposition to
the Vietnam war and his clashes with

President Nixon concerning war policy
are major issues in the initial stages of
his campaign. McCloskey spoke at
several locations in San Mateo, and was
asked repeatedly by different audiences
about his stand against the Vietnam
war. McCloskey stated that he believes
. . 70 percent of the reason that the
United States is still entangled in the
war is to avoid humiliation . . . and a
blow to our reputation as guarantor."
He accused the relationship between
Congress and the Defense Department
as being "riddled with deceit" and said
that Congress is like "an ostrich, hiding
it's head in the sand."
After the Pentagon papers had been
published, McCloskey and several of his
colleagues urged Congress to pastf a bill
ordering the Defense Department to
tell Congress exactly what actions are
being taken in Southeast Asia. The
motion was voted down, 118 to 236.
"Congress has failed the American
people by not demanding this informa
tion," McCloskey commented. "They
have, in effect, asked not to be told the
truth. However, the 118 votes is
probably 100 more than we would have
had one year ago."
The proposed Lockheed loan
brought many questions from McClos
key's followers. Early in the day at the
Probe Community Center in Kedwood
City, McCloskey, speaking in front of a
predominantly black and Chicano audi
ence, said he "tended to be against
backing the loan, but providing jobs is a
major issue, and Lockheed does this."
But later on in the day at several other
locations, the Congressman stated that
lie plans to vote against the loan
entirely.

In his whirlwind local campaign,
McCloskey condemned the present
inconsistancies in the welfare system.
According to McCloskey, because each
state decides how much a welfare
recipient will be allotted, the majority
of welfare recipients move to the states
with the highest allotment. McCloskey
favors trying to "federalize" the wel
fare system, and thus bring financial
relief to those few states.
Speaking in downtown Palo Alto,
McCloskey was questioned by a pro
ponent of women's rights. Asked about
his recent vote against a bill that would
provide more rights for women,
McCloskey justified his negative vote
on the grounds that ". .. providing
