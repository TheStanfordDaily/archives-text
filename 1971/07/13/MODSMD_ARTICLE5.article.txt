## The
						Radical As Worker-Quo Vadis? 
### jeff weil 
There is a trend. People keep
dropping out or graduating with
no place to go. In 1969 Fortune
magazine found that 42 percent
of the people between the ages of
1 and 24 wanted the "opportun
ity to change things rather than
make out well within the existent
system."
One of the main reasons we
have to change things is that the
system does not meet our needs.
This is true for non-radicals, too.
Many people who were unrecep
tive to radicals while in college
find the rhetoric of the corporate
state's workday harder to swal
low. So we talk about vocations
for social change:
Now Where?
So where do we go? In the
factories to organize workers?
Into the army to organize Gl's?
Into jail to organize political
prisoners?
Ex-students should not go into
the factories if they have no feel
for physical, mechanical work.
This does not mean they should
only go if they enjoy speed-ups,

polluted working conditions,
authoritarian hierarchies, etc. But
they should have some sort of
industrial inclination.
Too many radicals—myself in
cluded—have been afflicted by the
martyr-missionary complex that
gets them into situations where
they are both miserable and
ineffective. I hated every minute
of my steel factory job. I don't
think owning the means of pro
duction would have made any
difference to me.
New Jobs
This is not to say all students
should stay away from industrial
organizing. Many of us who would
be happier working with our
hands have been channeled into
reading books and writing term
papers. Moreover, support for
labor struggles can be given
without working on the assembly
line. White radicals can provide
skills for fundraising, legal aid, or
setting up printing presses and
mimeo machines.
But we should not exaggerate
the importance of the industrial

workers. Only seven percent of
the work force produces all the
nation's food and manufactured
goods and the numbers of unskill
ed workers have dropped 20
percent between 1950 and 1960.
The sectors which radicals have
neglected too much and which are
growing the fastest are the service
sector and the professional and
technical sector. HEW employees
have made radical demands re
cently for control over their jobs.
We have seen how crippling the
strikes of postal workers and the
New York municipal workers can
be.
Scientists and engineers should
be organized because they play
such an important role in tech
nological society, but have in
creasing reason to oppose this
one. More and more science
Ph.D.'s are out of jobs, and many
engineers are finding the work
that they do uncreative and
meaningless.
Old to Young
There develops a sharpening
contradiction between the high

level of training of young tech
nicians and their relative power
lessness vis a vis the owners of
corporations. Young engineers are
hired to take the jobs of older,
higher salaried engineers. When
they attain enough seniority for a
higher salary, they are often
replaced by younger engineers.
It has been interesting to watch
meetings of engineers angry not
only over unemployment, but also
about the military dependence of
their work, and the effect their
corporations have on the environ
ment.
Organizations which have been
set up to aid technical people in
finding alternatives to building
better bombs are Scientists and
Engineers for Social and Political
Action (SESPA) and the Tech
nology and Society Committee
(TASC). Clearly this is a place for
people with technical background
to work and change things.
Acquire Skills
We need to build counter
institutions as examples antagonis
tic to capitalistic institutions, but

also to take care of our constit
uency. It is no longer necessary
that every activist know the entire
history of the Cold War or be able
to recite the complete works of
Gramsci. Some radicals should
acquire skills in medicine, law,
people's technology.
There is an ongoing debate
whether radicals have to go all the
way through law school or medi
cal school to acquire the skills
needed. Moreover, since it is
becoming increasingly difficult to
be accepted at medical and law
schools, many people will have to
learn at free clinics and legal aid
offices.
We should be honest in evaluat
ing the uses of radical doctors and
lawyers. Although it is unlikely,
all of medicine could be socialized
as in England without a dent in
the power structure.
Important Roles
The AMA is not part of the
ruling class. This does not negate
the benefits of free clinics to date.
They have provided medicine for
people who would not get it

otherwise and actualized socialism
in the midst of capitalism.
For lawyers, while it is impor
tant to get all our brothers out of
jail, it might be smarter at times
to have ACLU types take our
cases.
The counterpart argument that
we should rely on left-liberal
doctors for all M.D. medicine I
find hard to buy: left-liberals are
not flocking to free clinics and it
is difficult to envision left-liberals
treating shoot-out victims without
reporting to the police or insisting
that the victims be brought to a
hospital.
Teaching continues to be an
important place for radicals to
organize from elementary educa
tion, to community colleges, to

the "highest academies—of the
empire." Some organizing around
Stanford continues to be neces
sary. This is one of the most
important tech no-industrial nerve
centers of the country.
The decision on what to do
with our lives is highly personal
ized and very difficult. We should
seek out something we like doing,
but for most of us effectiveness in
making social impact is a huge
factor in whether we like our
work. And we will never be
completely comfortable in any
job in this society. That is, after
all, why we have to be revolution
aries.
