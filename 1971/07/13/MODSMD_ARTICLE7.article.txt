Editor, The Daily:
I think Bill Ever's sentiments
on federal gun control (The Daily,
July 9th) are laudable but a bit
late. Since 1968 it has been
against federal law for anyone to
own a gun who is "...an unlawful
user of marihuana or other...".
The big cry about mail order
murder, if you remember it, was
so much horse apples.
It had been against the law to
mail firearms to convicted felons,
fugitives from justice, etc. since
the 1 93 o's. The new effects of the
1968 gun control laws were to
block all interstate commerce in
firearms between individuals (e.g.,
father and son), to take the guns
away from potheads, people un
der indictment (before they're
tried), and dishonorably discharg
ed veterans, and to let the U.S.
Treasury department collect re
cords on all new guns sold while
they presumably think over whom
to take them from next.
It appears that Americans will
be disarmed a few at a time while
the rest of us stand around
chorusing "We Love You Big
Brother" in the hope that we'll be
allowed to keep our guns this time
too.

Editor, The Daily:
The review committee for John
Dolly, a fired hospital worker,
recommended to the administra
tion that Mr. Dolly be rehired and
given a hearing after his court
trial. The committee recommen
dation was turned down fiat by
the President's office.
The committee then said it
would proceed with the hearings,
although it finds it "difficult to
carry forth a fair and just hearing
under a circumstance in which Mr.
Dolly is compromised..." This
appears less like "a unanimous
consent to withdraw its recom
mendations," as Robert Nelson,
Director of Personnel claims, than
an unhappy concession to the
dictatorial powers of the Stanford
Adminstration.
In John Dolly's case as well as
in past instances, it is obvious that
the Administration has (1) set up
a procedure without employee
participation in which they fire an
employee first and then allow him
to go through a sham grievance
procedure, (2) stacked the griev
ance committee 2 to 1 against the
employee, and (3) dictated the
matters which will be brought
before the committee in complete
violation of the University Guide
Memo 22.10. Then, when the
committee recommends some
thing contrary to the Administra

tion's wishes, the Administration
informs them that the committee
has only an advisory capacity
anyway.

Dear Chief Zurcher:
The purpose of this letter is to
inform you that I believe that I
have been treated unfairly by
your department upon being dis
missed from employment after
only two weeks.
It is my intention to notify the
labor department of the State of
California as well as the US
Department of Labor of my
treatment. They will probably be
interested in investigating my
situation under the Labor Stan
dards Act.
I do not believe that the
P.A.P.D. is interested in using
modern technology and com
petent advice (at the modest cost
of $3.00/ hr) to help reduce crime
in the area.
During the two weeks that I
was employed by the P.A.P.D., I
completed the following:
1. Literature search of the Journal
"Security World" for new security
techniques and notified the vendors.
2. Interviewed five (5) members of the
civic center staff and wrote a memor
andum on required equipment pur
chases and procedures for Civic Center
security.
3. Wrote to Chief of Police Matias of
Cedar Rapids, lowa and to Bell
Telephone Laboratories regarding re
search work in the area of connecting
burglar systems with police head
quarters.
4. Wrote a memorandum on weapon
procedure and proper holsters during
crowd control confrontations.
5. Proof-read the galleys of the "Crime
Prevention Index" that is about to be
circulated and found five (5) simple
spelling errors.
6. Completely updated the educational
survey file of the P.A.P.D. to 30 June
1971.
7. Wrote a memorandum suggesting the
use of modern data storage techniques
for keeping police records.
I personally find that the
apparent expenditure of $3,000
of city funds for the design of a
modernistic city seal a complete
waste.
There are many unemployed,
but highly trained, scientists and
engineers in the area. I believe
that they could be very useful in
government at all levels and that
the reason for not doing so is
politically motivated.
