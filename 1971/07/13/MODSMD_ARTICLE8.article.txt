# 'Still Falling'
## New Three-Stage Drama 
### DIANE McKENNEY 
The opening performance of
The Firehouse Theater Company's
production of "Still Falling," 'a
musical passage rite for people in
search of magic,' was certainly
magical and unique theater for
me.
The passage rite is in three
stages. The first state begins
immediately upon entering the
theater. The performers greeted us
by having us hold hands and walk
into a spiral until the audience
was completely inside.
During this first stage there was
a film of graphic and natural
scenes projected on the wall,
accompanied by atonal music
played on folk instruments. The
purpose of the first stage was to

join the audience and the per
formers into a potential com
munity. Unfortunately this stage
of the passage dragged, and the
audience, which was seated on
scaffolding placed in a circle
(pillows provided) became restless
and a bit bored.
Complex Rite
The second stage was indeed a
rite of great complexity. At times,
I felt it was too fast in action and
too slow in meaningful dialogue.
The physical movements of the
performers were overwhelming.
But my mind and eyes had
trouble because it was difficult to
simultaneously put together the
fragmented dialogue into ideas.
However, I was well aware of
the search 1 found myself a part
of—This search took me from
birth, the rejection of life, and the
eventual acceptance of life and
communion with people. But I
also found I had a more private
search for my own identity in the
community of the theater. I
wanted to be a part of this search,
but there was no requirement of
the audience to do so. There was
only opportunity to participate.
1 found myself playing a
sophisticated "ring around the
rosy" which went faster and
faster. When we fell down for the

last time, I felt a sense of
community among us.
No Names
There were about a dozen
unnamed young men and women
in the cast. There was no need for
names. The main character-a
symbol of our and his own
birth—did an outstanding job. It is
hard to be born again. But the
performer's acting gave the im
pression of being at the same time
both well rehearsed and spontan
eous.
The physical aspects of stage
two demanded a great deal
physically. The perfection of
movements was a delight. The
intensity of the performers' in
volvement was incredible. To do
this more than two nights a week
would be an impossible physical
and mental strain.
I did find out two names—the
playwright Nancy Walter and the
music composer John Franzen.
Franzen's music was a tremendous
success. His score was a combina
tion of the serious, the comical,
the traditional and the nontradi
tional. Performers played record
er, old drums, guitar, banjo,
accordian and even a metronome.
Interspersed with 30's tunes,
choruses, chanting, and folk songs

were also atonal melodies. I had
great difficulty underetandiug the
words of the atonal melodies
which was not well enunciated.
But most of the words had strong
meaning and in most cases were
very clear.
The music was both a back
ground for the action and action
in itself. The performers—with the
exception of the instrumentalists
and one female vocalist—were not
musically polished. But enthu
siasm made up for that.
Community Magic
The third stage of the "passage
rite" did not consist of perform
ers, musicians, and audience, but
of a community involved in each
others' and ones own magical
experience. I won't spoil the fun
for anyone, but 1 played in clay.
There was much more. It was then
that I understood my message and
the magic.
This is going to be a great
success if the performers can keep
up the necessary intensity of
involvement. The performers are
on Saturdays and Sundays at 8:30
p.m. through September 4. The
theater is located at 1572 Califor
nia at Polk, and the price is "$2.00
or whatever."

SUNDAY AT FROST—There have been many memorable Sunday afternoon concerts at Frost Ampitheater
and this Sunday may provide another such show. The people here took it easy during a break at Santana's
concert earlier this spring. A lot of the time most of the people were up dancing as they probably will be
again this weekend when Cold Blood, Elvin Bishop, Lamb and Sopwith Camel will play.
