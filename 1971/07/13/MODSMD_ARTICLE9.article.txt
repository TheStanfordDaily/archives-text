which is led by their namesake who used to play with Paul
Butterfield.

Lamb used to be a two-person group, but they have now added some
people and gone electric. Sopwith Camel had a big AM hit called
"Hello, Hello," in the late sixties and have recently been playing on
the local club circuit.
The show is being presented by ASSU Special Events and tickets at
$2.00 will be available at the gate.
