DOLLY'S JOLLlESâ€”Although John Dolly's grievance procedure tests some serious questions of the University's right to fire
workers, its first formal hearing Wednesday night was often punctuated by laughter. For example there was the time when
Robert Nelson, director of personnel Left), defined unacceptable behavior as "behavior that is unacceptable." Or when
defense counsel Bruce Franklin (right) stuttered over "what do you call them . . . peace officers." Even committee chairman
Keith Brodie (center) found it amusing when Nelson made it clear that it was he personally who had started the investigation
"after 1 was given information and photographs . . . from Mr. Schwartz."
