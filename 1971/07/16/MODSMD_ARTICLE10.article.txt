# Charles Schulz: 'Plain Folks'
## 
### DAVID SALTIEL 
Charles Schulz is like the comic
strip characters he draws.
He isjust "plain folks,"a friendly
man with graying hair, wire
rimmed glasses and a broad smile.
He is also, however, the creator of
perhaps the most widely-read
comic strip in the world, "Pea
nuts."
"I was just born liking to draw,
liking comic strips and having a
certain sense of humor ... a cer
tain line up of abilities . . . that all
fell together, giving me the strange
combination that helps one to
draw comics," explained the only
cartoonist to win the Rueben
award twice for being the "out
standing cartoonist of the year."
Schulz, who wanted to draw
"since I was about six years old,"
got his break in 1950 when
United Features Syndicate took
him away from his cartoonist job
in St. Paul, Minnesota. "The strip
began as an accumulation of
one-panel cartoons," recalled
Schulz. "Originally it was sup
posed to have been a panel
cartoon and not a strip. Then,
United Features and myself acci
dently discovered that I would
rather do a strip, so they said
'Well, let's make it into a strip,
but you'll have to create some

definite characters and give them
names! I simply took three or
four of the characters which I had
already been drawing in panels."
From that point on, "Peanuts,"
with Charlie Brown, Snoopy, and
Lucy and company, became what
can only be termed an unbeliev
able success. "The secret of

maintaining quality in a comic
strip," revealed Schulz, "is having
characters with personalities so
distinctive that those personalities
themselves give you ideas, which
are not necessarily out and out
gags. Sometimes it's just a simple
chuckle or a smile and the
personalities of the characters

become so liked by the readers
they just enjoy being around
those personalities."
Is Charlie Brown really Schulz's
alter-ego? "Not really," chuckled
the 49 year-old cartoonist, "al
though it makes a good story. In
fact, almost everything that you
say makes a good story if you
want it to and learn to say things
that make good stories. The truth
is rarely spoken. I think it's fairly
obvious, though, that if you're
going to create cartoon characters

you can create them only from
your own personality. You really
can't create too much by observ
ing other people. There's just not
that much to observe. So, Charlie
Brown, I suppose, is a little bit of
what I am and this is true of all of
the other characters."
Many of Schulz's cartoons deal
with "true-to-life" occurrences.
One of the most famous of these
encounters with reality involves
Charlie Brown and"the little
red-haired girl." "I don't know if
he'll ever speak to her," explained
Schulz.
Snoopy!
"Obviously the most popular
character," according to Schulz is
Snoopy, the Walter Mitty-like
beagle, who gets involved in just
about everything. One of
Snoopy's most famous "true-to
life" encounters came against the
Red Baron, who the beagle tried
to track down in his World War I
vintage Sopwith Camel. "What I
started off to parody in the whole
Red Baron thing was the movies
that were made about World War I
rather than the War itself. I could
have drawn him | Snoopy) as a
World War II veteran, but that
wasn't very funny. It's too close
io home. World War I was, of
course, a very innocent type of
war from the standpoint of most
people because we didn't become
too involved and it was kind of far
away, until they too discovered
the horror of it all."
To Charles Schulz, life isn't
horror. It is enjoying little things,
like his comic strip. "We all have
to justify our existence," explain
ed Schulz. "I think that all of us
should have some kind of excuse
for cluttering up the earth."
Charles Schulz's excuse comes
from the pleasure that people get
daily from his cartoons.
