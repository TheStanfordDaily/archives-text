# Suit Attacks Abortion Law
## 
### MADELINE NELSON 
Despite the "liberalized" 1967 law, abortions
are not available on request in California.
According to women's groups the law does not
work and they are actively trying to repeal all such
laws.
"In the first year of New York's liberalized
abortion law, over 200,000 legal abortions were
performed. During the same period 70,000 legal
abortions were done under the "reform" law in
California. If our law was really working, the
numbers would be the same," stated Helen
Morrison, head of the Palo Alto-Stanford chapter
of the California Committee to Legalize Abortion.
Class Action Suit
Abortions are the only medical procedure
restricted by law in California. The Association to
Repeal Abortion Laws (ARAL) is preparing a
women's class action lawsuit to try to overturn the
law. The suit will "challenge the constitutionality
of the laws" according to ARAL. Any woman who
is a resident of the state and a U.S. citizen may
join the suit as a co-plaintiff; nearly 100 women
have done so already.
At present abortions are available to women in
California if they have the money and know where
to go. Unlike New York, where the procedure can
be performed in a clinic, California requires that

they be done in a hospital which keeps the cost
high.
Locally, Problem Pregnancy Information Center
(851-2300) provides a free referral service with
testing, counselling, and doctors' appointments. It
is estimated that it takes an average of one week
between initial contact and the abortion.
On a national level the Zero Population Growth
headquarters in Los Altos (941-2670) runs a
computerized Abortion Information Data Bank.
This provides free listings of doctors and
counseling services, as well as information on cost,
for the entire country.
Coalition Meeting
Women's groups throughout the country have
joined to form a Women's National Abortion
Coalition which is meeting in New York this
weekend. The group organized because of "the
recognition of abortion as a woman's right is going
to require nationwide political action and
agitation."
At the meeting they will discuss ways to fight
"restrictive" contraception laws (which still exist in
30 states) in addition to the abortion laws. Some
women are suggesting a massive demonstration in
Washington in October. The Supreme Court will
be hearing two cases in its October session that
could decide if abortion is a constitutional right.
