# Outstanding Night Of Dance
## 
### GARY SALT 
See the Alvin Ailey American
Dance Theater. This fabulous
group of young dance virtuosos is
among the most exciting and
consistently interesting modem
dance ensembles around. Their
range, artistic boldness, superb
physical skills, and diversity un
folded before a woefully small
audience at Flint Center in Cuper
tino this past week.
On Tuesday, Ailey presented
"Streams," "Flowers," and "Re
velations," for a mixed program
ranging from abstract dance to
Ailey's ballet-ftiography of Janis
Joplin.
"Streams" is a plotless rush of
dances and snippets of dances
skittering about the stage to the
percussion ensemble sounds of
Kabelac's musical inventions. On a

bare stage, the company moves
through a series of angled en
trances and formations, a dizzying
display of movements and stage
business in couples, trios, and all
other combinations.
"Streams" is an exceptional
opening number and serves well to
introduce the ensemble and the
Ailey style of total bodily involve
ment, strong emphasis on the
arms and a full exploration of the
stage space. Among the soloists,
newcomer Mari Kajiwara was
particularly powerful and confi
dent in her moves. Ramon Segarra
and Dudley Williams performed
well, in a duo, and with crisp
precision.
Many Discoveries
Occasionally there is so much
movement and action in
"Streams" that it is hard to guage
the overall stage-picture; there is
always something for the audience
to find within the intricate com
pany formations; always room for
discovery on our part. Each
dancer in "Streams" is an image
without a narrative; guided by the
pounding or plinking of Kabalec's
cymbals, drums, and xylaphone.
"Flowers," Ailey's version of
Janis Joplin's mercurial career,
was, sadly, well below his best
efforts. However, Ailey was cour
ageous enough to make a definite
statement; a definite interpreta
tion underscores "Flowers."
There are assumptions in it about
great talent and Janis specifically
with which many of us disagree.
Rosamond Lynn, leggy and
beautiful, played the central role
of Janis as a tortured, explosive,
frightened, complex pop genius,
doted on by photographers,
swarmed over by sychophants,
glad-handers, and assorted hip
cretins, and finally lured to
death—burning herself out on
good booze and bad stuff
dropping amidst a shower of
roses, plastic roses, falling stiffly
on her corpse.
"Flowers" is a story of apothe
osis and death together. Janis is
tortured, beaten, tossed around
and smashed by a coven of
silverized male Furies during a bad
trip, only to return to Ramon
Segarra as a laughing, leering
spectre wheedling her closer to
her finale.

Both Segarra and Miss Lynn
performed well in what was little
more than a variation of the
French apache dance performed
in cabarets: ganster and helpless
victim. But they cannot tell Janis'
story.
'Flowers' Wilts
In the end, "Flowers" is a sad
unfriendly, uncomfortable melo
drama which punches up human
weakness and generates more
meaningless pity than enlighten
ment. That great talent has
humanity which is sometimes
profitably forgotten is true; but
the destruction of great talent
cannot be made delightful.
Ailey seems to make Janis' life
simply the sum of her install
ment-plan death but she has to be
more than her death; where is her
life in Ailey's dance; where her
career and her art? We see only
her infirmities. As a dance-drama,
"Flowers" eventually bogs down
in its own facility and slickness.
But after "Flowers," came
"Revelations," so far, Ailey's
greatest work—a series of dance
suites based on traditional Negro
spirituals—which delve into the
American Black's cultural heri
tage. But it's more.
Smooth Stones
The ten short dances compris
ing the entire work are like
smooth, polished stones, worn
even more beautifully through
constant care, sensitivity, and the
performers' love. Performers like
Judith Jamison, tall and triumph
ant with her parisol, strutting
through "Processional" and "Wad
ing in the Water," and like Dudley
Williams, stunning in "1 Want To
Be Ready."
But it was Linda Kent and Give
Thompson who put it all together
on Tuesday night with a brief
duet called "Fix Me, Jesus." Here
was faultless execution, clean,
unpretentious, and quietly over
whelming. Their performance was
one of pure beauty; a perfection

done, gone, and unmatched by
anything I have ever seen on a
stage.
Ailey's company will repeat
these productions and others in a
five-performace stint at Zellerbach
Auditorium at UC Berkeley this
weekend.
