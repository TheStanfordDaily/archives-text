The Children's Center of the Stan
ford Community has been unable to
find a financial basis in its almost two
year existence. According to Nora
Bennett, the director and head teacher,
the center is "barely making it. We pay
salaries, insurance, electric and water
bills, and buy the kids juice. That's it."
The child center's two major branch
es provide for daily baby sitting and

nursery school care for parents in the
Stanford community. Babysitting ser
vice for 25 children aged 6 months to
2' 2 years costs the parents 60 cents to
$1.00 per hour. The nursery care for 25
children aged 2 y i to 5 years costs $50
to $90 per month, based on the
parents' ability to pay.
Janet Johnson, head of the center's
board of directors is also in charge of
searching for money. She stated that
the university offered them the use of
an abondoned elementary school build
ing on May field Avenue, but has
refused further support. The directors
have applied to various foundations for
financial aid but have received no help
so far.
Mrs. Johason, who is the daughter
of Vice-President for Finance, Kenneth
Cuthbertson, feels that the university is
ignoring its responsibility to the parents
within the Stanford community. She
pointed out that although over 50
percent of the parents using the child
care service were Stanford students, the
ASSU had refused to continue the
$100 grant it gave the center last year.
Betsy Morris, a teacher at the center
described the near financial disaster
that almost closed the center last April.

She said that in order to prevent
bankruptcy the parents were asked to
pay a surcharge on their regular fees to
the center.
At the moment, the center's most
pressing need is a new fence. Volunteer
parents and the staff have begun a
"fence fund" and have collected less
than half of the estimated $200 for the
cost of the fence.
