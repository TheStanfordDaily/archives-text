# Reward Offered For Bomber
## 
### 
A $10,000 reward has been offered by the University for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the
person or persons responsible for the Monday night
bombing of the campus home of Robert M. Nelson,
director of personnel and employee relations.
The offer was made Tuesday by Provost William E.
Miller, who said that "violence against any person in this
community—student, staff or faculty—is directed against
every member of this community."
Meanwhile, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office
could report no new information about the bombing.
Remnents of the 10-pound, 18-inch pipebomb were sent to
Washington, D.C. for analysis by the Treasury Department.
Police could not say exactly what kind of explosive was in
the bomb, nor would they say if the bomb was detonated
by a timing device. They did say, however, that they
thought the bomb had been planted, rather than thrown.
The Monday night blast blew pieces of shrapnel into the
wall of the Nelson house and blew down part of a wooden
fence. Nelson later estimated damage at about $1,000.
Nelson has refused to speculate on the motive for the
bombing. However, last month he fired five workers for

their alleged participation in the April 9 sit-in that ended in
a near-riot. There have been two demonstrations outside his
office in recent weeks, and the Transamerica Title
Insurance Co. building in downtown Palo Alto was bombed
two weeks ago "in revolutionary solidarity with the
workers struggle at Stanford University." according to a
note mailed to the Palo Alto Times.
Persons with information about the bombing have been
urged to call Bruce Wiggins, the University's director of
public safety, at ext. 3633 (days) or ext. 3413 (nights), or
the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office at 967-6908 ext.
3523.
The University earlier offered two $5,000 rewards in
connection with the April bombings of President Lyman's
office and the Junipero House lounge. So far, no one has
claimed either of those rewards.
In its lead editorial yesterday, the Palo Alto Times said:
"The explosion of a pipe bomb at the home of the
Stanford personnel director is a piece of crude terrorism—
an outrage to the university and the whole community
surrounding it. Whoever set it is cowardly, murderous and
stupid."
