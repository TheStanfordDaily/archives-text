SRI CLOSES IRVINE LAB
Succumbing to economic pressures,
the Stanford Research Institute an
nounced that it will close its one-year
old laboratory at Irvine and move its
professional staff from there to its
Menlo Park office.
The Institute "will not be curtailing
anything," according to Weldon B.
Gibson, executive vice president of the
company.
SRI severed its ties with the
university in 1969 after several months
of student protest over the company's

military and classified-military research.
The original severance agreement re
quired that the name be changed within
five years after severence from the
University. Although no name-change
has been planned yet, informed sources
believe the Institute will probably just
identify itself by its well-known initials,
SRI.
CANCER BREAKTHROUGH
By inhibiting the cancer cell's repair
processes, Drs. Christopher D. Town,
Kendrick C. Smith and Henry S.
Kaplan of the radiology department
have discovered a new method for
making the cell's more responsive to
radiation treatment.
The process interferes with the repair
mechanism of DNA (deoxyribonuclei
acid) and ultimately will help scientists
to determine which drugs will inhibit
cancer cell growth.
AGGRESSION STUDY
The cause and effects of human
violence and aggression on society will
be studied by the Psychology Depart
ment through the aid of a $505,686
grant from the Commonwealth Fund of
New York.
Plans eventually call for a laboratory
of stress and conflict to be set up with
the areas of research concentrating on
the problems of crowding and aggres
sive behavior.
PLUNKETT SIGNS
Heisman Trophy winner Jim Plun
kett yesterday signed a multi-year

contract with the New England Patriots
for an undisclosed amount.
Plunkett signed in Chicago before
closed circuit cameras connected to
Amherst, Massachusetts where Patriot
officials watched.
Expressing relief that the negotia
tions were over, Plunkett said only that
he was "looking forward to coming to
Boston and working with Joe Kapp and
learning the business of pro football."
