# Heroin Arrests Aim At 'Haven'
## 
### 
"We're not through by any means,"
vowed Mountain View Asst. Police
Chief Robert Schatz after his depart
ment, in cooperation with Palo Alto
Police, arrested 17 persons on charges
of selling narcotics and several others
on related charges.
The arrests, which were made on
Tuesday and Wednesday, came as a
result of three-month undercover in
vestigation into the local heroin traffic
by the three departments. Indictments,

leading to the arrests, were obtained
from the Santa Clara County Grand
Jury on Monday.
Although the police departments are
not dropping the enforcement of other
drug laws, Lt. Gary Tatum of the Palo
Alto Police Department admits that
"right now, we're concentrating on
heroin."
"It's going to cause people to think
twice before they deal in this area,"
explained Tatum in referring to the

recent arrests. "We're not going to stop
dealing or cure addicts, but we'd like to
move them out of here. This has been
quite a haven in the past."
Dr. David E. Smith, founder of the
Haight-Ash bury Free Medical Clinic,
recently called the Palo Alto area "one
of the biggest middle-class junkie scenes
in the United States today."
Tatum believes that Palo Alto has
been a "haven" because the area
"attracts young people."
The police departments have been
concentrating on destroying the area
heroin trade in the past few weeks,
already having made a total of 30
arrests. Those arrested most recently
were not linked by Tatum to a
"conspiracy or syndicated type of
operation."
According to Tatum, there has been
"a new awareness in the last few
months" regarding clearing crime prob
lems related to heroin. In the past, the
department had been too busy to
concentrate on the drug problem, he
said.
The current investigation, com
mented Tatum, did not involve drug
use on the Stanford campus.
