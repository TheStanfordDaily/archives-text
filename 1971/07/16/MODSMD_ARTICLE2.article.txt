# Nelson Testifies
## Dolly Grievance Hearing Begins 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
In its first formal hearing the
grievance committee investigating the
dismissal of Hospital employee John
Dolly attempted to hear testimony
Wednesday night from Director of
Personnel Robert Nelson.
His testimony, however, was inter
rupted continuously by objections
from Dolly and his counsel, suspended
Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Contending that the administration's
case was "farcical" and that most of
Nelson's testimony was hearsay, Frank
lin several times asked for a dismissal of
the hearing.
Dolly was fired from his Hospital job
as a research assistant because of
"unacceptable behavior" at a sit-in in
the Hospital April 9. He has filed a
grievance complaining that he was fired
"without appropriate cause" and that
he did not have "adequate oppor
tunity" to defend himself.
The hearing, conducted by a three
man grievance committee, is chaired by
Keith Brodie, assistant professor of
psychiatry. The others on the commit
tee are Roland Finston, health physics,
and Harry Miller, cardiology. The
committee is enpowered to make
recommendations to the University
President.
Most of the 70 persons attending the
open hearing appeared to sympathize
with Dolly, often laughing and jeering
at Nelson's testimony. Twice members
of the audience stood up and charged
that Nelson was deliberately lying.
Nelson, whose home was damaged
slightly by a p'.pe-bomb Monday night,
began by presenting an opening state
ment of why Dolly was fired. He tried
to enter written statements by several
other administrators, but Franklin
objected on grounds of hearsay and his
objecting was sustained by Brodie.

Later Nelson entered several photo
graphs allegedly showing Dolly outside
the administration corridor after de
monstrators had battled with police.
Nelson stated that it was his under
standing that the only way one could
get into the area at this time was from
inside the blockaded offices. Other
entrances were blocked off, he said.
Another piece of evidence Nelson
cited was a statement by policeman
Richard Peardon that he had seen Dolly
inside the administration office shortly
before the police cleared it.
Franklin Confident
After hearing the administration's
position. Franklin grinned and said that
all he needed to do to counter Nelson's
case was show that it was possible for
persons outside the administration
offices to enter the area where Dolly
allegedly was photographed, and dis
count Peardon's testimony by showing
tha he was prejudiced against Dolly.
One seemingly important point in
the defense is also the lack of a clear
definition of unacceptable behavior.
Nelson tried to explain his position by
citing employee Guide Memo 22.8, the
University policy on campus disrup
tions, and a list of "misconducts"
published by a private management
consulting firm in Washington.
Once Nelson said, "Unacceptable
behavior means misconduct, serious
misconduct." Another time he said,
"unacceptable behavior is behavior that
is unacceptable."
Franklin compared Nelson's testi
mony to "Alice in Wonderland," and
said, "to say that somebody's behavior
is unacceptable is simply to say that
somebody else does not like it or does
not accept it." He also said that one of
the misconducts on Nelson's list was
"unauthorized parking." He then asked

for dismissal on grounds that the
charges were not specified.
The committee told Franklin that
they were not enpowered to dismiss or
overrule Dolly's firing, but could only
make recommendations and wished to
hear further testimony. Later when
Franklin objected to testimony on
grounds of hearsay, Brodie said, "al
though this is not a legalistic or
adversary procedure and strict rules do
not apply, there are some rules that
do."
Nelson's Role Unclear
Franklin also complained that it was
not clear in what capacity Nelson was
political action by that action (the
sit-in)," said Manganiello. "We
certainly had a mass struggle.
There were more non-cadre in
volved in that than there were
Venceremos cadre. The list of
defendants will prove that."
Daily reporters noticed, how
ever, at the time that Franklin was
not a principal figure in the
organizing or decision-making pro
cess at the Medical Center sit-in,
which involved no more than 100
persons at any one time. Franklin
was only an observer during the
final hours before the police
broke up the sit-in.
Missing Leaders?
Brown members of the Ven
ceremos Central Committee dis
agreed also with the report in the
Daily that three members of the

organization's old Central Com
mittee had left Venceremos.
Guero Rodriquez said, "There
has never been one CC (Central
Committee) member that has quit
the organization: the old CC, the
in-between CC and the CC now."
Manganiello said that he was
put back on the Central Commit
tee "within the last month" and
that "It wasn't that I replaced
anybody; I just came back on the
Central Committee."
After discussing this matter
with Stanford radicals, some of
whom provided information for
Tuesday's story, the Daily learned
that it had misunderstood its
original source. Three members,
total, from three central commit
tees (which governed the organiza
tion at different times) have left
the organization.
One was a steel worker; one

disappeared and turned up later in
Los Angeles, and a third left
because her husband disapproved
of the organization.
In addition, the Daily has
learned that persons who were in
the top leadership of the Revolu
tionary Union, but left the RU for
Venceremos in December, have
since left Venceremos. And when
Manganiello was put back on the
Central Committee, he was replac
ing someone.
Theory & Practice
Persons who recently have left
Venceremos charged in Tuesday's
Daily that the group is anti-theory
and anti-intellectual.
In response, Manganiello said
angrily: "There is one statement
in here (the Daily article) which is
the most clearly racist statement
in the entire thing: 'She (Cherry)
said that the prevalence of these
tendencies in the organization has
led to an emphasis on the
importance of recruiting street
fighters rather than people with a
greater political and theoretical
orientation' . . . There have been
no white people recruited into
this organization for the last three
months. She's talking about peo
ple of color."
"These people themselves (pro
letarians, lumpenproletarians, and
Third World people) constitute
the greatest political and theoreti
cal orientation .. . That's where
political and theoretical orienta
tion comes from in this organiza
tionâ€”right out of these people,"
Manganiello said.
Responding to a question,
Flores denied that Lenin's state
ment that "without revolutionary
theory, there can be no revolu
tionary movement" meant that
theory was primary over practice.
Although the group irregularly
publishes a newspaper, Pamoja
Venceremos, it has published no
theoretical works like the RU's
Red Papers.
At the end of the meeting, the
Central Committee members were
asked if they had a statement on
the Nelson house bombing Mon
day night. Katarina Davis Delvalle
answered that "We say 'right on'
to the bombing" and then repeat
ed Franklin's oft-stated formula
that a revolutionary neither con
firms nor denies responsibility for
an act of which he approves.

consulting firm in Washington.
Once Nelson said, "Unacceptable
behavior means misconduct, serious
misconduct." Another time he said,
"unacceptable behavior is behavior that
is unacceptable."
Franklin compared Nelson's testi
mony to "Alice in Wonderland," and
said, "to say that somebody's behavior
is unacceptable is simply to say that
somebody else does not like it or does
not accept it." He also said that one of
the misconducts on Nelson's list was
"unauthorized parking." He then asked

for dismissal on grounds that the
charges were not specified.
The committee told Franklin that
they were not enpowered to dismiss or
overrule Dolly's firing, but could only
make recommendations and wished to
hear further testimony. Later when
Franklin objected to testimony on
grounds of hearsay, Brodie said, "al
though this is not a legalistic or
adversary procedure and strict rules do
not apply, there are some rules that
do."
Nelson's Role Unclear
Franklin also complained that it was
not clear in what capacity Nelson was
political action by that action (the
sit-in)," said Manganiello. "We
certainly had a mass struggle.
There were more non-cadre in
volved in that than there were
Venceremos cadre. The list of
defendants will prove that."
Daily reporters noticed, how
ever, at the time that Franklin was
not a principal figure in the
organizing or decision-making pro
cess at the Medical Center sit-in,
which involved no more than 100
persons at any one time. Franklin
was only an observer during the
final hours before the police
broke up the sit-in.
Missing Leaders?
Brown members of the Ven
ceremos Central Committee dis
agreed also with the report in the
Daily that three members of the

organization's old Central Com
mittee had left Venceremos.
Guero Rodriquez said, "There
has never been one CC (Central
Committee) member that has quit
the organization: the old CC, the
in-between CC and the CC now."
Manganiello said that he was
put back on the Central Commit
tee "within the last month" and
that "It wasn't that I replaced
anybody; I just came back on the
Central Committee."
After discussing this matter
with Stanford radicals, some of
whom provided information for
Tuesday's story, the Daily learned
that it had misunderstood its
original source. Three members,
total, from three central commit
tees (which governed the organiza
tion at different times) have left
the organization.
One was a steel worker; one

disappeared and turned up later in
Los Angeles, and a third left
because her husband disapproved
of the organization.
In addition, the Daily has
learned that persons who were in
the top leadership of the Revolu
tionary Union, but left the RU for
Venceremos in December, have
since left Venceremos. And when
Manganiello was put back on the
Central Committee, he was replac
ing someone.
Theory & Practice
Persons who recently have left
Venceremos charged in Tuesday's
Daily that the group is anti-theory
and anti-intellectual.
In response, Manganiello said
angrily: "There is one statement
in here (the Daily article) which is
the most clearly racist statement
in the entire thing: 'She (Cherry)
said that the prevalence of these
tendencies in the organization has
led to an emphasis on the
importance of recruiting street
fighters rather than people with a
greater political and theoretical
orientation' . . . There have been
no white people recruited into
this organization for the last three
months. She's talking about peo
ple of color."
"These people themselves (pro
letarians, lumpenproletarians, and
Third World people) constitute
the greatest political and theoreti
cal orientation .. . That's where
political and theoretical orienta
tion comes from in this organiza
tionâ€”right out of these people,"
Manganiello said.
Responding to a question,
Flores denied that Lenin's state
ment that "without revolutionary
theory, there can be no revolu
tionary movement" meant that
theory was primary over practice.
Although the group irregularly
publishes a newspaper, Pamoja
Venceremos, it has published no
theoretical works like the RU's
Red Papers.
At the end of the meeting, the
Central Committee members were
asked if they had a statement on
the Nelson house bombing Mon
day night. Katarina Davis Delvalle
answered that "We say 'right on'
to the bombing" and then repeat
ed Franklin's oft-stated formula
that a revolutionary neither con
firms nor denies responsibility for
an act of which he approves.
In its first formal hearing the
grievance committee investigating the
dismissal of Hospital employee John
Dolly attempted to hear testimony
Wednesday night from Director of
Personnel Robert Nelson.
His testimony, however, was inter
rupted continuously by objections
from Dolly and his counsel, suspended
Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Contending that the administration's
case was "farcical" and that most of
Nelson's testimony was hearsay, Frank
lin several times asked for a dismissal of
the hearing.
Dolly was fired from his Hospital job
as a research assistant because of
"unacceptable behavior" at a sit-in in
the Hospital April 9. He has filed a
grievance complaining that he was fired
"without appropriate cause" and that
he did not have "adequate oppor
tunity" to defend himself.
The hearing, conducted by a three
man grievance committee, is chaired by
Keith Brodie, assistant professor of
psychiatry. The others on the commit
tee are Roland Finston, health physics,
and Harry Miller, cardiology. The
committee is enpowered to make
recommendations to the University
President.
Most of the 70 persons attending the
open hearing appeared to sympathize
with Dolly, often laughing and jeering
at Nelson's testimony. Twice members
of the audience stood up and charged
that Nelson was deliberately lying.
Nelson, whose home was damaged
slightly by a p'.pe-bomb Monday night,
began by presenting an opening state
ment of why Dolly was fired. He tried
to enter written statements by several
other administrators, but Franklin
objected on grounds of hearsay and his
objecting was sustained by Brodie.

Later Nelson entered several photo
graphs allegedly showing Dolly outside
the administration corridor after de
monstrators had battled with police.
Nelson stated that it was his under
standing that the only way one could
get into the area at this time was from
inside the blockaded offices. Other
entrances were blocked off, he said.
Another piece of evidence Nelson
cited was a statement by policeman
Richard Peardon that he had seen Dolly
inside the administration office shortly
before the police cleared it.
Franklin Confident
After hearing the administration's
position. Franklin grinned and said that
all he needed to do to counter Nelson's
case was show that it was possible for
persons outside the administration
offices to enter the area where Dolly
allegedly was photographed, and dis
count Peardon's testimony by showing
tha he was prejudiced against Dolly.
One seemingly important point in
the defense is also the lack of a clear
definition of unacceptable behavior.
Nelson tried to explain his position by
citing employee Guide Memo 22.8, the
University policy on campus disrup
tions, and a list of "misconducts"
published by a private management
consulting firm in Washington.
Once Nelson said, "Unacceptable
behavior means misconduct, serious
misconduct." Another time he said,
"unacceptable behavior is behavior that

In addition, the Daily has
learned that persons who were in
the top leadership of the Revolu
tionary Union, but left the RU for
Venceremos in December, have
since left Venceremos. And when
Manganiello was put back on the
Central Committee, he was replac
ing someone.
Theory & Practice
Persons who recently have left
Venceremos charged in Tuesday's
Daily that the group is anti-theory
and anti-intellectual.
In response, Manganiello said
angrily: "There is one statement
in here (the Daily article) which is
the most clearly racist statement
in the entire thing: 'She (Cherry)
said that the prevalence of these
tendencies in the organization has
led to an emphasis on the
importance of recruiting street
fighters rather than people with a
greater political and theoretical
orientation' . . . There have been
no white people recruited into
this organization for the last three
months. She's talking about peo
ple of color."
"These people themselves (pro
letarians, lumpenproletarians, and
Third World people) constitute
the greatest political and theoreti
cal orientation .. . That's where
political and theoretical orienta
tion comes from in this organiza
tionâ€”right out of these people,"
Manganiello said.
Responding to a question,
Flores denied that Lenin's state
ment that "without revolutionary
theory, there can be no revolu
tionary movement" meant that
theory was primary over practice.
Although the group irregularly
publishes a newspaper, Pamoja
Venceremos, it has published no
theoretical works like the RU's
Red Papers.
At the end of the meeting, the
Central Committee members were
asked if they had a statement on
the Nelson house bombing Mon
day night. Katarina Davis Delvalle
answered that "We say 'right on'
to the bombing" and then repeat
ed Franklin's oft-stated formula
that a revolutionary neither con
firms nor denies responsibility for
an act of which he approves.
In its first formal hearing the
grievance committee investigating the
dismissal of Hospital employee John
Dolly attempted to hear testimony
Wednesday night from Director of
Personnel Robert Nelson.
His testimony, however, was inter
rupted continuously by objections
from Dolly and his counsel, suspended
Associate Professor H. Bruce Franklin.
Contending that the administration's
case was "farcical" and that most of
Nelson's testimony was hearsay, Frank
lin several times asked for a dismissal of
the hearing.
Dolly was fired from his Hospital job
as a research assistant because of
"unacceptable behavior" at a sit-in in
the Hospital April 9. He has filed a
grievance complaining that he was fired
"without appropriate cause" and that
he did not have "adequate oppor
tunity" to defend himself.
The hearing, conducted by a three
man grievance committee, is chaired by
Keith Brodie, assistant professor of
psychiatry. The others on the commit
tee are Roland Finston, health physics,
and Harry Miller, cardiology. The
committee is enpowered to make
recommendations to the University
President.
Most of the 70 persons attending the
open hearing appeared to sympathize
with Dolly, often laughing and jeering
at Nelson's testimony. Twice members
of the audience stood up and charged
that Nelson was deliberately lying.
Nelson, whose home was damaged
slightly by a p'.pe-bomb Monday night,
began by presenting an opening state
ment of why Dolly was fired. He tried
to enter written statements by several
other administrators, but Franklin
objected on grounds of hearsay and his
objecting was sustained by Brodie.

Later Nelson entered several photo
graphs allegedly showing Dolly outside
the administration corridor after de
monstrators had battled with police.
Nelson stated that it was his under
standing that the only way one could
get into the area at this time was from
inside the blockaded offices. Other
entrances were blocked off, he said.
Another piece of evidence Nelson
cited was a statement by policeman
Richard Peardon that he had seen Dolly
inside the administration office shortly
before the police cleared it.
Franklin Confident
After hearing the administration's
position. Franklin grinned and said that
all he needed to do to counter Nelson's
case was show that it was possible for
persons outside the administration
offices to enter the area where Dolly
allegedly was photographed, and dis
count Peardon's testimony by showing
tha he was prejudiced against Dolly.
One seemingly important point in
the defense is also the lack of a clear
definition of unacceptable behavior.
Nelson tried to explain his position by
citing employee Guide Memo 22.8, the
University policy on campus disrup
tions, and a list of "misconducts"
published by a private management
consulting firm in Washington.
Once Nelson said, "Unacceptable
behavior means misconduct, serious
misconduct." Another time he said,
"unacceptable behavior is behavior that
is unacceptable."
Franklin compared Nelson's testi
mony to "Alice in Wonderland," and
said, "to say that somebody's behavior
is unacceptable is simply to say that
somebody else does not like it or does
not accept it." He also said that one of
the misconducts on Nelson's list was
"unauthorized parking." He then asked

for dismissal on grounds that the
charges were not specified.
The committee told Franklin that
they were not enpowered to dismiss or
overrule Dolly's firing, but could only
make recommendations and wished to
hear further testimony. Later when
Franklin objected to testimony on
grounds of hearsay, Brodie said, "al
though this is not a legalistic or
adversary procedure and strict rules do
not apply, there are some rules that
do."
Nelson's Role Unclear
Franklin also complained that it was
not clear in what capacity Nelson was
political action by that action (the
sit-in)," said Manganiello. "We
certainly had a mass struggle.
There were more non-cadre in
volved in that than there were
Venceremos cadre. The list of
defendants will prove that."
Daily reporters noticed, how
ever, at the time that Franklin was
not a principal figure in the
organizing or decision-making pro
cess at the Medical Center sit-in,
which involved no more than 100
persons at any one time. Franklin
was only an observer during the
final hours before the police
broke up the sit-in.
Missing Leaders?
Brown members of the Ven
ceremos Central Committee dis
agreed also with the report in the
Daily that three members of the

organization's old Central Com
mittee had left Venceremos.
Guero Rodriquez said, "There
has never been one CC (Central
Committee) member that has quit
the organization: the old CC, the
in-between CC and the CC now."
Manganiello said that he was
put back on the Central Commit
tee "within the last month" and
that "It wasn't that I replaced
anybody; I just came back on the
Central Committee."
After discussing this matter
with Stanford radicals, some of
whom provided information for
Tuesday's story, the Daily learned
that it had misunderstood its
original source. Three members,
total, from three central commit
tees (which governed the organiza
tion at different times) have left
the organization.
One was a steel worker; one

disappeared and turned up later in
Los Angeles, and a third left
because her husband disapproved
of the organization.
