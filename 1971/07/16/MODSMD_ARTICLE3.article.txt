President Nixon, in a surprise na
tion-wide radio and television appear
ance last night announced that he has
accepted an invitation to visit the
People's Republic of China "at an
appropriate date before May, 1972."

that Dr. Henry M. Kissinger, his
Assistant for National Security Affairs,
paved the way for the visit with a secret
trip to Peking last week, at which time
he met and consulted with Chinese
Premier Chou En-Lai.

Our action in seeking a new relation

Nixon emphasized that "our action
in seeking a new relationship with the
People's Republic of China will not be
at the expense of our old friends."
It is believed that this comment was
directed specifically towards National
ist China and the Soviet Union, both of
which look askance at the prospect of
improved relations between the United
States and Mainland China.
This is the text of Mr. Nixon's
statement, as recorded by radio station
KZSU:
"The announcement I shall now read
is being issued simultaneously in Peking
and in the United States:
" 'Premier Chou En-Lai and Dr.
Henry Kissinger, President Nixon's
Assistant for National Security Affairs,
held talks in Peking from July 9 to 11
1971. Knowing of President Nixon's
express desire to visit the People's

Republic of China, Premier Chou
En-Lai,on behalf of the Government of
the People's Republic of China has
extended an invitation to President
Nixon to visit China at an appropriate
date before May, 1972. President
Nixon has accepted the invitation with
pleasure. The meeting between the
leaders of China and the United States
is to seek the normalization of relations
between the two countries, and also to
exchange views on questions of concern
to the two sides.'
"In anticipation of the inevitable
speculation which will follow this
announcement, I want to put our
policy in the clearest possible context.
Our action in seeking a new relation

ship with the People's Republic of
China will not be at the expense of our
old friends. It is not directed against
any other nation. We seek friendly
relations with all nations. Any nation
can be our friend without being any
other nation's enemy. I have taken this
action because of my profound convic
tion that all nations will gain from a
reduction of tensions and a better
relationship between the United States
and the People's Republic of China.
"It is in this spirit that I w ill under
take what I deeply hope will become a
journey for peace. Peace not just for our
generation, but for future generations
on this earth we share together.
"Thank you, and good night."
President Nixon, in a surprise na
tion-wide radio and television appear
ance last night announced that he has
accepted an invitation to visit the
People's Republic of China "at an
appropriate date before May, 1972."
At the same time, the President said
that Dr. Henry M. Kissinger, his
Assistant for National Security Affairs,
paved the way for the visit with a secret
trip to Peking last week, at which time
he met and consulted with Chinese
Premier Chou En-Lai.
Reading from a prepared text, the
President went before the television
cameras at 7:30 PDT, and took less
than five minutes to make his historic
statement.
The same announcement was issued
simultaneously in Peking.
Nixon emphasized that "our action
in seeking a new relationship with the
People's Republic of China will not be
at the expense of our old friends."
