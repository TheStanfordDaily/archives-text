# Campus Police Bill Argued In Assembly
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A bill to give more power to Stanford Police passed its first committee in
Sacramento this week, while campus administrators continue considering who
should be the department's new chief.
The California Assembly Criminal Procedures Committee approved Wednesday
a Stanford-initiated plan which would allow private campuses to upgrade their
police from security guards to full "peace officer" status.
But the bill's opponents—led by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department—seem confident they can kill the bill in its many further steps
through the legislature. To become law, the proposal must still be approved by the
Assembly Ways and Means committee; then passed by the full Assembly, several
Senate committees, and the Senate itself.
Deadline Passed
Meanwhile, administrators yesterday failed to meet their own July 15 deadline
for selection of a new Stanford Police chief. Presidential Assistant John Schwartz
said the decision will be delayed until next week while administrators consider
questions raised in an advisory committee's recommendations on candidates for
the job.
Long-developing uncertainty over the status of Stanford's police became
obvious in April when Chief Thomas Bell resigned. Bell cited "lack of direction
from the University administration as to the exact responsibilities of the
department," as a reason for his resignation.
But informed sources report the University was equally upset with Bell's
performance and had been considering replacing him several months before the
resignation.
Since Bell left, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department has taken a more
active role in policing the campus, administrators have been seeking a new chief, a
commission on the role of earrvpus police was appointed, and the bill to boost
campus police power has awaited Assembly action.
Police Bill
Schwartz and Santa Clara Undersheriff Tom Rosa were in Sacramento 1 uesday
and Wednesday, carrying opposing arguments on the campus police bill—which
would give campus police arrest powers they now lack.
Santa Clara Sheriff James Geary, whose department now covers Stanford as an
"unincorporated area," charged in a position paper that a fully-powered campus
police force would be "subject to the whims of the college administration.
Rosa said the Stanford administration "seems to think it will be a simple thing
to recruit high quality personnel for a campus department."
Geary opposed the bill's provisions for campus departments run by the colleges
rather than a publicly-elected Sheriff or a chief chosen by an elected city council.
But he said he could support another system to form a police district on
campus, "the administration of which would be determined bv the voters residing
on the campus." (Under a present state ruling, now being challenged in court,
most students under 21 years of age could not register as campus residents.)
To combat the Assembly bill, Geary offered new campus activities by his
department. He proposed making some members of the University security forces
reserve sheriff's deputies "as the need dictates."
Sheriff Substation
And he proposed a sheriff's "substation on the campus staffed with
administrative and supervisory personnel." Geary said the new station would
"augment the already adequate Sheriff's patrol and detective force" now on
campus.
But Schwartz told the Daily the University wants to expand its campus police
powers exactly because the Sheriff's force is inadequate. He said a spring
expansion of the Sheriff's efforts on campus has only provided one fulltime patrol
car plus a traffic car for which the University must pay.
"We want a full police service on the campus," Schwartz said. "The Sheriff
cannot provide that. He has asserted that with his one to two men he can cover
the whole campus."
Schwartz said Geary's insistance that police serve under elected officials is
answered by extensive controls the bill would give to the state Attorney-General.
He said the Attorney-General could set performance standards the departments
would have to maintain to be given full powers.
Sunnyvale Assemblyman Richard Haydyn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said campus
police are best-equipped to handle "unique qualities of campuses" because they
"have some acquaintance with the students in a first-hand way."

And he proposed a sheriff's "substation on the campus staffed with
administrative and supervisory personnel." Geary said the new station would
"augment the already adequate Sheriff's patrol and detective force" now on
campus.
But Schwartz told the Daily the University wants to expand its campus police
powers exactly because the Sheriff's force is inadequate. He said a spring
expansion of the Sheriff's efforts on campus has only provided one fulltime patrol
car plus a traffic car for which the University must pay.
"We want a full police service on the campus," Schwartz said. "The Sheriff
cannot provide that. He has asserted that with his one to two men he can cover
the whole campus."
Schwartz said Geary's insistance that police serve under elected officials is
answered by extensive controls the bill would give to the state Attorney-General.
He said the Attorney-General could set performance standards the departments
would have to maintain to be given full powers.
Sunnyvale Assemblyman Richard Haydyn, a co-sponsor of the bill, said campus
police are best-equipped to handle "unique qualities of campuses" because they
"have some acquaintance with the students in a first-hand way."
A bill to give more power to Stanford Police passed its first committee in
Sacramento this week, while campus administrators continue considering who
should be the department's new chief.
The California Assembly Criminal Procedures Committee approved Wednesday
a Stanford-initiated plan which would allow private campuses to upgrade their
police from security guards to full "peace officer" status.
But the bill's opponents—led by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Department—seem confident they can kill the bill in its many further steps
through the legislature. To become law, the proposal must still be approved by the
Assembly Ways and Means committee; then passed by the full Assembly, several
Senate committees, and the Senate itself.
Deadline Passed
Meanwhile, administrators yesterday failed to meet their own July 15 deadline
for selection of a new Stanford Police chief. Presidential Assistant John Schwartz
said the decision will be delayed until next week while administrators consider
questions raised in an advisory committee's recommendations on candidates for
the job.
Long-developing uncertainty over the status of Stanford's police became
obvious in April when Chief Thomas Bell resigned. Bell cited "lack of direction
from the University administration as to the exact responsibilities of the
department," as a reason for his resignation.
But informed sources report the University was equally upset with Bell's
performance and had been considering replacing him several months before the
resignation.
Since Bell left, the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Department has taken a more
active role in policing the campus, administrators have been seeking a new chief, a
commission on the role of earrvpus police was appointed, and the bill to boost
campus police power has awaited Assembly action.
Police Bill
Schwartz and Santa Clara Undersheriff Tom Rosa were in Sacramento 1 uesday
and Wednesday, carrying opposing arguments on the campus police bill—which
would give campus police arrest powers they now lack.
Santa Clara Sheriff James Geary, whose department now covers Stanford as an
"unincorporated area," charged in a position paper that a fully-powered campus
police force would be "subject to the whims of the college administration.
Rosa said the Stanford administration "seems to think it will be a simple thing
to recruit high quality personnel for a campus department."
Geary opposed the bill's provisions for campus departments run by the colleges
rather than a publicly-elected Sheriff or a chief chosen by an elected city council.
But he said he could support another system to form a police district on
campus, "the administration of which would be determined bv the voters residing
on the campus." (Under a present state ruling, now being challenged in court,
most students under 21 years of age could not register as campus residents.)
To combat the Assembly bill, Geary offered new campus activities by his
department. He proposed making some members of the University security forces
reserve sheriff's deputies "as the need dictates."
