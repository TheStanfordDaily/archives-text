# Venceremos Leadership Denounces 'Racist Sissies'

The six brown members of the
Venceremos Central Committee Wed
nesday night denounced persons leaving
the revolutionary organization as "rac
ist sissies" and "oppressors" and
charged that the Daily had overesti
mated the number of persons leaving
the organization in a story Tuesday.
Two of the three white members of
the committee, including Associate
Professor of English H. Bruce Franklin,
were not present at the special meeting
called to explain its position to the
Daily, which Tuesday detailed the
intraorganizational split.
Members of the Central Committee
made two major points in their
presentation: first, that any white
radical who is not in the multi-national
—and Third World controlled—demo
cratic-centralist organization in his
geographical area is objectively a racist;
and second, that those who have left
the organization are "sissies" for their
unwillingness to press forward on grave
and risky matters now.
"Fifteen, a maximum of 20 people,
have left the organization," said Aaron
Manganiello, Chairman of the Central
Committee. "All of those people are
white, all of those people come from
Stanford (and) nowhere else in the
organization."
Palo Alto, Too
The individuals whom Manganiello
terms "sissies" began leaving Vencere
mos last weekend over the question of
whether to endorse the Oakland or the
New York-Algiers faction of the Black

Panther Party. A number of cadre from
Palo Alto who are neither present nor
past Stanford students are also leaving,
the Daily has learned.
Individuals from Stanford who have
left Venceremos include Miriam Cher
ry, who has extremely close ties with
the Oakland Panther organization; John
Kaman, a graduate student in English;
and John Keilch, a library worker who
was suspended from his job for 45 days
for his alleged participation in the
Henry Cabot Lodge disruption in early
January. The people who have left
Venceremos have not met together as a
group.
Venceremos, a multi-national, Marx
ist-Leninist organization based in Red
wood City, has cadre in cities ranging
from San Francisco to San Jose. Its
leadership is predominantly brown, and
Third World members of the Central
Committee have total veto power over
white members.
Earlier estimates of the organiza
tion's size ranged between 400 and
1000. Since Tuesday, the Daily has
received feedback indicating that these
figures are inflated. The exact member
ship of the group is a closely-guarded
secret.
Panther Split
Much of the Central Committee
members' discussion with the Daily
revolved around their position on the
Black Panther Party split. Manganiello
announced that Venceremos and the
Black Liberation Front, another revolu
tionary group based in Redwood City
and East Palo Alto, have written the
Oakland Panthers and requested a
meeting. However, they have received

no response so far setting a date for
such a meeting.
Manganiello that the Daily's
statement that the Venceremos Central
Committee had recently determined
the Oakland Black Panther Party's
position to be unconscionable is "an
out and out lie."

"Internally in the organization, we're
constantly studying the documents put
out by Los Siete, the Chicano Revolu
tionary' Party (and) the Young Lords
on the Panthers and also studying the
Panther position," Manganiello said,
since the shift from "revolutionary
internationalism" to "revolutionary
intercommunalism" in the fall of 1970.

"There is a tremendous amount of
discussion going on inside our organiza
tion."
In the course of the conversation, it
came out that only two of the brown
members of the Central Committee
have read Right On!, the New York
faction's newspaper and that Cleaver's
position papers have not circulated
within the organization.
"We don't have a policy, a line, an
idea, an inclination at this time. If we
did, it would be made public . . . What
I'm saying here is not that we disagree
or have taken a line on the Black
Panther Party. What we're saying is that
we've taken no line on the Panther
question."
Newton's Revisionists
However, the Daily heard from other
sources that the Central Committee had
in fact reached a decision in the
Panther dispute last week. They appar
ently came to the conclusion that the
Oakland (Huey Newton-David Hilliard)
faction is "revisionist." Reportedly, it
was a scheduled, but not published,
statement to this effect in this week's
Pamoja Venceremos, the group's news
paper, that touched off the actual split.
In Tuesday's Daily, Cherry had cited
the importance of the "survival"
programs and welfare rights advocacy
of the Oakland Panthers.
On this point, Manganiello said:
"Venceremos, second only to the
Panthers, has the largest amount of
serve-the-people programs anywhere in
the country: three food co-ops, two
day-care centers, a college, two 'peo
ple's garages.' "
"We learned that from the Black
Panther Party. It was the Panther Partv

that taught the nation how to build
serve-the-people projects."
Serv ice or Struggle
Some Central Committee members,
however, have reportedly termed such
community service activity "counter
revolutionary," and Venceremos mem
bers working at the People's Medical
Center in Redwood City have been
called "revisionists."
Several persons who recently left
Venceremos and others involved in its
projects have charged that voluntary
welfare programs are not deemed
valuable by the Venceremos leadership
unless they are moving the beneficiaries
quickly toward "militant struggle."
Because the East Palo Alto food
co-op was not doing this, according to
these sources, Venceremos withdrew its
support, and the co-op collapsed.
Another point of controversy was
the Daily's charge that Franklin had
criticized Venceremos' organizing on
bread and butter issues around the fired
Tresidder and Medical Center em
ployees.
Masses at Hospital
Commenting on the April 8-9 Medi
cal Center sit-in, which ended in a
near-riot when policemen charged into
a barricaded corridor, Assistant Profes
sor of (lernian John (Juan) Flo res said
"Bruce (Franklin) was one of the
people who was most instrumental in
the level of militancy that did ex
ist .. . He was one of the people who
was providing leadership in thai whole
struggle."
"We moved the masses of workers at
Stanford to a much higher level of

strange mutant creature halfway be

In cross examination by the commit
tee Nelson stated that "the basis of the
action was a positive identification of
Dolly in the corridor." He said it had
"no relationship" to the criminal
procedures which Dolly also faces in
the case.
The next meeting of the committee
has been scheduled for either Tuesday
evening or night. The exact time will be
announced in Tuesday's Daily.
