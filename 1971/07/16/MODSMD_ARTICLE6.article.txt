What did you learn in school
today
Dear little boy of mine?
What did you learn in school
today ?
I learned that policemen never lie
/ learned that soldiers never die-
That 's what I learned in school
today
That's what I learned in
school. . .
As sung by Pete Seeger
(Many young school children have
written to the President or to the
Department of State about
Vietnam. The State Department
prepared this answer:)
Vietnam is a very old country
in Asia, about 8,000 miles away
from the United States. About 17
years ago. part of the Vietnamese
people called Viet Minh were
fighting against France which had
ruled Vietnam for many years.
Many of the Viet Minh wanted
Vietnam to be a communist
dictatorship rather than a free
country. The Vietnamese
communists are especially
dangerous because they believe in
the use of armed force and terror.
The Viet Minh finally won a big
victory over the French forces.
The French and officials from
some other countries who were
interested in Vietnam sat down to
talk with the Viet Minh in the city
of Geneva in Switzerland. They
agreed to make peace and to
divide Vietnam into two parts.
The northern part is held by
the communists and is called
North Vietnam. South Vietnam is
held by those Vietnamese who do
not want to live under communist
rule. It is also called the Republic
of Vietnam.
Many people in the North went
to live in the South to get away
from the communists. Many more
wanted to go too but the
communists broke the rules of the

agreement made at Geneva and
would not let them go.
North Attacks South
A few years went by. The
North Vietnamese were planning
to take over all of South Vietnam
by elections because there were
more Northerners to vote than
Southerners and because the com
munists would make sure, by
force if necessary, that more
people would vote for the North
than for the South.
The leaders of South Vietnam
refused to take part in elections
that they knew would not be fair.
This made the communist leaders
of the North very angry, and they
decided to take over South
Vietnam by force.
When the country was divided
into two parts, the communists
had left some men in the South

who pretended to be like the
Southerners. These men received
orders to dig up the guns which
they had hidden and to kill people
in the South so the men in the
South would be afraid to fight
against the communists.
To Kill Teachers
These communists in the
South, called guerrillas, would
often go into villages at night and
kill important people such as the
mayor and the school teacher.
This would make the villagers
afraid to tell the South Vietnam
ese soldiers where the guerrillas
were hiding.
The guerrillas did not wear
uniforms and it was easy for them
to hide in the jungle or to pretend

they were villagers. During this
time we were sending guns and
supplies to the South Vietnamese
so they could fight back. We also
sent some soldiers to advise them
how to fight.
Want Own Future
As time went on, the North
Vietnamese .sent more and more
men from the North into South
Vietnam. They began to send
soldiers who attacked the soldiers
of the army of South Vietnam
and soon there was a real war
going on. The soldiers from the
North and the guerrillas were well
trained to fight.
Things were going badly for the
people of the South. They wanted
to be able to decide how to run
their country for themselves. So
they asked us to help them fight
the North Vietnamese. The South

... the soldiers from the North are
not winning anymore.

Vietnamese had showed that they
were brave people and we knew
that if the North Vietnamese were
not stopped from trying to take
over another country by shooting
and killing, the other countries in
Asia would be in danger too from
the communists.
So we decided to help the
South Vietnamese people, and
some other countries also decided
to help. That way we hoped to
keep the war in Vietnam from
becoming a big war that might put
the whole world in danger.
America Helps Vietnam
America promised to help the
South Vietnamese and we sent
soldiers, ships and airplanes to
Vietnam. Five other countries also
sent soldiers. Over 30 countries

state department

gave food, medical supplies and
many other things to help the
South Vietnamese.
We have been fighting very hard
for six years to help the South
Vietnamese soldiers. Together we
have done well and the soldiers
from the North are not winning
any more. They are still trying to
take over the South but they
know that the South with our
help is stronger than they are.
Good Soldiers
The South Vietnamese are
becoming such good soldiers that
we are bringing some of our men
back to America. In May and June
last year American and South
Vietnamese soldiers destroyed the
communist bases in the next-door
country of Cambodia.
We did this because the bases
gave the communists a chance to
attack our men in South Vietnam
and then to run and hide in
Cambodia. Our action in Cam
bodia made it safe to go on
bringing our men home.
This year some South Vietnam
ese forces, with the help of US air
power, have moved into the
nearby country of Laos to cut the
supply lines the communists need
to carry on the war in South
Vietnam.
No Bigger War
We and South Vietnam do not
want to take over the North and
we do not want to make the war
bigger. All we want to do is to
stop the communists from taking
South Vietnam.
President Nixon has said that if
the communists go back home to
the North and leave the South
alone, the war will end. We are
having talks with leaders from the
North in the city of Paris in
France.
At these talks, we are telling
them that if they will take all of
their soldiers out of South Viet
nam, we will too. But if we take

all of our soldiers out of South
Vietnam before peace is made or
before we are sure that the South
Vietnamese can take care of
themselves, we would be breaking
our promise to them.
Other countries which are our
allies would then believe that our
word was no good and they would
not respect us. Also, President
Nixon is very concerned about
our men held prisoner by the
enemy. He has said that as long as
North Vietnam holds a single
American prisoner, we will have
forces in South Vietnam.
'Just Peace'
We are sorry the North Viet
namese are not ready to pull back

their soldiers, but we think they
will come to see that peace is
better than to go on killing.
President Nixon and all of us
believe that a good and just peace
is possible. Until the North
Vietnamese agree, we must have

lots of patience and grit to go on
with the talks in Paris and with
the fighting in Vietnam.
