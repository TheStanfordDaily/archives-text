Editor, The Daily: \ am a 100
percent disabled veteran who
wishes to enroll at your University
and may require your assistance
and advice on the proper course
of action.
I have written to the Dean of
Admissions in order to determine
the requirements nccessary to
meet your standards academically,
financially, etc. This may seem a
bit unusual but there is adequate
reason. I am confined to a
wheelchair and am on a recovery
program and would possibly need
aid in getting around campus.
I would possibly be able to help
another student who amy be
financially embarrassed and would

be able to help in my humble
way.
This is a test probe examining
the possibility of overcoming
certain barriers. From an editorial
in your own publication you
mentioned awareness and being
involved. Well, here's your chance.
For your enlightenment, I am
46 years old, and a possible
fugitive from a rest home. At
most you are under 30. Maybe
you would understand and help
overcome the so-called communi
cation gap.
Thanking you in advance for
your assistance.
