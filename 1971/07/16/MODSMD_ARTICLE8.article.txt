## Behavior Modifying Drugs 
### 
In the July-August 1971 Trans
action, Charles Witter reports that
a "careful reading of Department
of Health, Education and Welfare
(HEW) testimony at the Gallagher
[House Privacy Subcommittee!
hearing [in September 1970]
suggests that 200,000 children in
the United States are now being
given amphetameine and stimu
lant therapy, with probably an
other 100,000 receiving tranquil
izers and antidepressants."
Witter quotes John Holt's testi
mony at the Gallagher hearing:
"We take lively, curious, energetic
children eager to make contact
with the world and to learn about
it, stick them in barren classrooms
with teachers who on the whole
neither like nor respect nor under
stand nor trust them, restrict their
freedom of speech and movement
to a degree that would be judged
excessive and inhuman even in a
maximum security prison, and

that their teachers themselves
could not and would not tolerate.
"Then, when the children resist
this brutalizing and stupefying
treatment and retreat from it in
anger, bewilderment and terror,
we say that they are sick with
'complex and little-understood'
disorders, and proceed to dose
them with powerful drugs that are
indeed complex and of whose
long runs effects we know little or
nothing, so that they may be
more ready to do the asinine
things the schools ask them to
do."

On July 8, John Kenneth
Galbraith, testifying before the
Senate Banking Committee said
that federal loan guarantees for
ailing giant corporations like
Lockheed would be another ex
ample of "socialism for the rich."
The June 10 San Francisco
Chronicle carried a Washington

Post story containing this impor
tant nugget of information: "The
banks apparently see another
advantage to the Government
guarantee. In the event of a
bankruptcy, the banks apparently
hope that the Government will
take Lockheed's plant at an
inflated value, leaving more assets
for other creditors [i.e., the
banksj."
In light of President Nixon's
disclosure last night that Henry
Kissenger, his adviser, has been
visiting Peking and that Nixon
himself will go to China, commen
tators are predicting that the U.S.
will not oppose Mao's government
replacing Chiang's in the United
Nations organization.
Amid the hoopla over this
question through the years, per
spective has been lost somewhere.
1 always liked the isolationist
wisdom of the bumper-sticker
slogan: "Give Red China Our
United Nations Seat."
Anyway with Red China in the
U.N. a boring, yet frequent topic
for debate tournaments will be
eliminated.

Congress is currently consider
ing putting a lower ceiling on the
dollar amount of farm subsidies to
any single farmer. The House
wants to lower the maximum; the
Senate doesn't.
The total annual farm subsidy,
according to a 1971 Brookings
Institution paper by Charles L.
Schultze, is between $9 billion
and $10 billion, including annual
direct outlays from the national
budget of some $5 billion and
about $4.5 billion in higher prices
of farm products paid by con
sumers as a result of price
supports.
Investigative reporting by Nick
Kortz of the Washington Post
brought out the fact that this year
Senator James Eastland of Missis
sippi was again able to circumvent

bill evers

the current ceiling of $55,000
(the House proposes a ceiling of
$20,000 a year) to gain a federal
subsidy of about $160,000.
All ceiling proposals have such
loopholes, and the farm subsidy
program continues to function as
a splendid dole for the rich. It
ought to be abolished.
The June 26 issue of the New
Republic contains a through de
bunking of the Nader's Raiders'
study of federal antitrust enforce
ment, The Closed Enterprise
System.
Richard Posner (formerly of
Stanford Law School) says of the
book: "Worse than the contradic
tions, the tendentiousness, and
the tone of the study is its
superficiality."
He points out the study's
numerous cases of incredible il
logic. For example, "The authors
disparage the significance of the
collapse in conglomerate corpora
tions' profits: 'The market power
held by conglomerates, however,
will not wither away as easily as
its dividends.' They had previous
ly pointed out that market power
means the ability to obtain excess
profits."
