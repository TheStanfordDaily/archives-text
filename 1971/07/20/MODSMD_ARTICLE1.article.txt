# Miller Intervenes
## Dolly Counsel Challenged 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
Associate Prof. H. Bruce Franklin's
right to act as counsel for John Dolly in
his grievance hearing has been challeng
ed by Provost and Acting President
William Miller.
In a letter sent to Grievance
Committee Chairman Keith Brodie,
Miller wrote, "I am sure you are aware
that Professor Franklin is suspended
from his faculty position at Stanford.
He is thus disabled from performing
any functions as an employee, and this
extends to representing another em
ployee in a University Grievance
pro ceding."
Franklin told the Daily, "It's a
complete outrage. I am an employee."
He explained that although he has been
suspended from his regular duties,

"they can't suspend me from my status
as an employee. Representing another
employee is not a duty it's something
that's done at the request of another
employee to oppose the administra
tion."
Franklin further charged that "in the
first hearing we were too effective in
showing what a case of lies their case
was. We can only conclude that they're
afraid to come face to face with the
people they're trying to fire."
According to Brodie the committee
doesn't have much choice except to
follow Miller's instructions. "If the man
to whom we must ultimately make a
recommendation tells us how to pro
ceed, then we can't really question
that. If we continue to allow Franklin
to act as counsel, Miller could simply
throw out our recommendation on
those grounds."
Asked whether he agreed with
Miller's interpretation of Franklin's
status as an employee, Brodie said, "It
appears to be a legal question ... and I
feel Provost Miller probably had com
petent legal counsel."
Said Dolly, "You play by their
games, and when you win they change
the rules. They've done it five or six
times already." Dolly said he consider
ed the first hearing a victory. "We
really moved forward on that. Of
course, it's a sham, but what's impor
tant is that it's teaching people what it
is."
The next hearing of the committee
had been scheduled for today, but as of
last night it appeared that it would be
put off until tomorrow or Thursday.
Brodie said that the grievance commit
tee will meet privately at noon today to
decide what should be done. The time

and place of the hearing will be
announced on campus radio station
KZSU.
According to Dolly one of the
problems holding up the hearing is
trying to get witnesses for the admini
stration. He said, "We thought Nelson
would be lining up witnesses, but he
isn't and Brodie has been having to do
it. So far he has had no luck."
Brodie said that he had been having
trouble getting witnesses to agree to
appear, but that now it looked as if
most of the witnesses who had been
suggested at the first hearing last
Wednesday would appear at some
point.
It is still unclear, however, what will
be the next order of business. Original
ly it was to be the continuation of the
administration case to sustain Dolly's
dismissal. Dolly, however, has suggested
that because of the trouble getting
witnesses his side may begin their case
first. He also suggested that it may be
appropriate to bring witnesses to
discuss Miller's challenge against Frank
lin.
It is possible the hearing may simply
be postponed.
Miller, in his letter, suggested that "if
he desires, Mr. Dolly should be given
additional time to prepare his case."
Dolly, however, said he wanted to
get on with the case as fast as possible,
and charged the administration with
trying to stall. According to Dolly, "I
either have to get this job back soon, or
get on and find another one."
Although Brodie discounted the idea
of continuing the hearings with Frank
lin acting as defense counsel, Roland
Finston, another member of the com
mittee, suggested that a compromise
may be possible. He declined to make
public what he had in mind.

CONCERT CASUALTYâ€”The man above was one of several bloodied victims of some scattered fighting which occurred at
Sunday's rock concert at Frost Ampitheater. During a period of more than an hour midway through the afternoon, violence
flared up sporadically. Fists and beer bottles were among the weapons observed. Twice the master of ceremonies pleaded with
the "mad dogs" and asked the crowd to help "cool it. The disturbances never involved more than a handful of the capacity
crowd and most of the violence had fizzled out before the Elvin Bishop Group finished up the show with a typically strong
set. Cold Blood, Lamb and Sopwith Camel were the other featured groups in what was largely just a nice, warm Sunday
afternoon of music.
