# 'Two And Only' Are Here
## 
### 
; The Broadway show, "Bob and
Ray—The Two and Only," opens
tonight in Memorial Auditorium
in an exclusive West Coast engage
ment. The show will run through
this Sunday, with performances at
8:00 p.m. every evening, and a
special Sunday matinee at 2:30
p.m.
Bob Elliott and Ray Goulding
are best known to college audi
ences at voices in most of the
funnier ads on radio and televi
sion. While their exposure on the
West Coast has been limited, they
have been familiar personalities in
the East since 1946.
"Bob and Ray—The Two and
Only" opened on Broadway last
fall to generally enthusiastic re
views, and ran for six months. It is
a collection of their favorite
routines, assembled from 25 years
of material.
Hector Lassie
Masters of the humor of under
statement and specialists in impro
visation, Bob and Ray have
created such characters as Hector
Lassie, Wally Ballou, Larry Love
breath, David Chetley, Neil Stur
bush, and the immortal "Mary
Backstage, Noble Wife," the para
digm of soap opera heroines.
Bob and Ray first came to
national prominence in 1951,
when they were signed to a
radio/television contract by NBC,
after having produced their subtle
brand of comedy on Boston radio
station WHDH for five years.

NBC utilized them in some 18
hours of radio time weekly, in
addition to a 15-minute daily
television show. There followed
various series of "Bob and Ray"
programs on several New York
stations, along with stints on
"Monitor" and the Mutual and
CBS radio networks.
Their series of "Bert and Harry
Piels" ads for the Piels Bros.
Brewing Co., (manufacturer of a
beer distributed throughout the
northeast) made Bert and Harry
household words, and led to a
spontaneous (and successful)
"Bring Back Bert and Harry"
bumper sticker campaign when
the company threatened to drop
the ads.
The results of their efforts have
earned them two Peabody Awards
for humor. Their radio/TV com
mercials, produced through their
corporation, Goulding Elliott
Greybar Productions, have re
ceived numerous awards as well.
