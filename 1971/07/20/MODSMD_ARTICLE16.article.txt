# Camp Trains Miniature Athletes
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A crowd of uniformed gnomes milled around
Tresidder Drug Store. The little people waited as their
keepers moved them into the store for a weekly
candy-buying spree.
The midgets asked full-sized passersby to buy them
merchandise storekeepers sometimes deny to littler
folks: "Mister, will you go in and buy me a Playboy
Magazine?"
Their t-shirts explained in red lettering that they
were the 9 to 14-year-old members of the fourteenth
annual "Stanford Coaching Camp." About 250 young
athletes attend each of the three two-week sessions
for a workout in every sport from football to archery.
The miniature "jocks" are rushed from basketball
instructions to swimming lessons. They eat lunches
planned by the Stanford athletes' trainer at the
Training Table—"the same one used by the Stanford
varsity football squad," a camp leaflet boasts. They
see sports movies and relax with ping-pong
tournaments.
Director of Baseball Ray Young heads a team of
Stanford coaches who train the campers and pick up
a summer salary along the way. Young said the camp
tries to avoid high-pressure competition, and the
"only hustle is to go from one sport to another."
He added the campers are not all future Olympics

stars. "Our kids run all the way from almost spastics
to very good athletes."
At Maples Pavilion a basketball coach supervised a
basket-shooting contest among ten to eleven-year
olds. The coach said the camp fails to attract the
most talented child athletes.
"The best ones specialize," he explained. Their
parents send them to football or baseball or soccer
camps rather than Stanford's eclectic program.
Looking at a gym full of dribblers, the coach
confessed, "We don't really get to improve their skills
in just two weeks. Mostly we just keep them busy and
give them a chance to play the game."
What do parents, many of them Stanford alumni,
expect of the coaching camp? "to babysit," the coach
answered.
But most of the campers themselves seemed more
enthusiastic about their training. And the camp's
leaflet promised the parents the coaches would teach
"your boy the most important quality of any
successful competitor-confidence in himself and his
own abilities." It explained the sports training would
carry over into success in later life.
The two-week program costs $95 for day campers,
plus another $195 for the 185 campers who stay
overnight in Toy on Hall. Profits go to the Athletic
Department general funds.

Counselors are mostly Stanford students, working
part-time. They lead the sports matches, give awards
for the cleanest rooms, and enforce rules against
roaming around the campus.
The Stanford coaches are the camp's star
attraction. Football coach John Ralston was advertis
ed as a staff member even though he did not show up
this summer.
Some of the college coaches seem ill-at-ease with
their boisterous little students. A basketball coach
said he keeps the kids constantly busy "so they don't
start climbing the walls."
And Young said the kids are allowed to attend
only one two-week session in a summer because
repeaters "would know too much about the camp.
It's hard enough to control the campers."
Campers who yesterday began the summer's final
session spent most of their time trying to find the
lunchroom and playing fields. Most followed the
advice of a perceptive twelve-year-old who shouted
out, "Just follow the crowds."
But there were doubters in the crowd of little
athletes, some away from home for the first time. A
ten-year-old asked this reporter for advice: "Do you
think they'll let me go home to Buriingame? I caught
a cold, and I shouldn't stay."
"Besides," he added matter-of-factly, "I'm home
sick."

for a workout in every sport from football to archery.
The miniature "jocks" are rushed from basketball
instructions to swimming lessons. They eat lunches
planned by the Stanford athletes' trainer at the
Training Table—"the same one used by the Stanford
varsity football squad," a camp leaflet boasts. They
see sports movies and relax with ping-pong
tournaments.
Director of Baseball Ray Young heads a team of
Stanford coaches who train the campers and pick up
a summer salary along the way. Young said the camp
tries to avoid high-pressure competition, and the
"only hustle is to go from one sport to another."
He added the campers are not all future Olympics

stars. "Our kids run all the way from almost spastics
to very good athletes."
At Maples Pavilion a basketball coach supervised a
basket-shooting contest among ten to eleven-year
olds. The coach said the camp fails to attract the
most talented child athletes.
"The best ones specialize," he explained. Their
parents send them to football or baseball or soccer
camps rather than Stanford's eclectic program.
Looking at a gym full of dribblers, the coach
confessed, "We don't really get to improve their skills
in just two weeks. Mostly we just keep them busy and
give them a chance to play the game."
What do parents, many of them Stanford alumni,
expect of the coaching camp? "to babysit," the coach
answered.
But most of the campers themselves seemed more
enthusiastic about their training. And the camp's
leaflet promised the parents the coaches would teach
"your boy the most important quality of any
successful competitor-confidence in himself and his
own abilities." It explained the sports training would
carry over into success in later life.
The two-week program costs $95 for day campers,
plus another $195 for the 185 campers who stay
overnight in Toy on Hall. Profits go to the Athletic
Department general funds.

Counselors are mostly Stanford students, working
part-time. They lead the sports matches, give awards
for the cleanest rooms, and enforce rules against
roaming around the campus.
The Stanford coaches are the camp's star
attraction. Football coach John Ralston was advertis
ed as a staff member even though he did not show up
this summer.
Some of the college coaches seem ill-at-ease with
their boisterous little students. A basketball coach
said he keeps the kids constantly busy "so they don't
start climbing the walls."
And Young said the kids are allowed to attend
only one two-week session in a summer because
repeaters "would know too much about the camp.
It's hard enough to control the campers."
Campers who yesterday began the summer's final
session spent most of their time trying to find the
lunchroom and playing fields. Most followed the
advice of a perceptive twelve-year-old who shouted
out, "Just follow the crowds."
But there were doubters in the crowd of little
athletes, some away from home for the first time. A
ten-year-old asked this reporter for advice: "Do you
think they'll let me go home to Buriingame? I caught
a cold, and I shouldn't stay."
"Besides," he added matter-of-factly, "I'm home
sick."
