# China Experts React To Nixon Trip
## 
### LEE HERTZENBERG DAVID SALTIEL 
Asian experts at Stanford are fram
ing their own analyses of President
Nixon's surprising announcement that
he will soon visit the People's Republic
of China.
Prof. John Gurley, of the Economics
Department pointed to the end of the
Indochinese conflict as a major motiva
tion for Nixon's decision. "The clue,"
Gurley said, "may lie in Senator Hugh
Scott's statement that before Nixon
goes to China, all combat troops will be
out of Indochina. That could be part of
a deal being worked out."
"I can see two other important
reasons for Nixon's decision," Gurley
went on. "One is that China is now a
nuclear power. They're strong. They
have to be reckoned with. The other is
that there has been pressure on Nixon
for a long time from the business
community to open up China to trade.
Chinese Misread
Prof. John Lewis, of East Asian
Studies, also emphasized Vietnam,
stating that "I think the trip is a
tremendous step forward but, several
more steps are needed. The United
States will have to have taken steps
toward Indochina in order to make it
more than just an exchange of pleasant
ries. Unless these things are done,
Peking will be in a box, because it will
find itself pressured. They can't be used
in that way. The Chinese were always
misread. They are hard-headed, practi
cal revolutionaries.
"This has been in the works for a
good long time. It can be traced to a
series of policies by the Nixon Admin
istration. The Administration is follow
ing a normalization of policy with
Peking."
President Nixon's trip to China,
according to Lewis, is further proof
that "China will be in the United
Nations by this fall."
Nixon Saving Face
Banning Garrett, of Concerned Asian
Scholars, analyzed the situation from a
different perspective. "This is a sign of
weakness on Nixon's part," he said.
"He knows he has lost in Indochina and
will have to get out. He hopes to save

face as best he can. If he can parlay the
Indochinese loss into a rapprochement
with China, he will come off as the
great peacemaker, and possibly save his
political scalp.
"It is clear," Garrett went on, "that
the Chinese are on the offensive right
now. They are strong. They have
consolidated the cultural revolution.
They are winning in Vietnam. If they
can drive a hard bargain with Nixon
they will probably get the U.S. out of
South East Asia militarily, possibly
slow down the rearmament of Japan
which is worrying them, and maybe
even get Taiwan back. They can afford
to let Nixon save a little face. Besides,
if theyhelp to make peace in Indochina,
it will also be a sign of their friendliness
with the majority of American people,
who don't want the war either.
"The Chinese, are dedicated to the
prevention of World War III," Garrett
continued. They have stated as a matter
of policy that it is the duty of all
revolutionaries to insure peace on an
international level while promoting
revolution at a local level. Thus, by
opening up relations between
themselves and the U.S., they have put
a wedge between the Americans and
the Russians which will make it less
likely that these two countries will join
together to attack China. This then
means more security for China, which
allows them a greater freedom to
pursue their political aims.
"There has been some talk recently
of Nixon going to Hanoi," Garrett
added. "This is another sign of Nixon's
weakness. If he goes there Hanoi might
very well turn over the prisoners of war
directly to him. They can afford it.
They want the war over and the U.S.
out of the country. If they have to get
us out by playing up to Nixon's grand
gesture, well, why not? Victory is
victory."
Opening of Trade
Professor John Emmerson, of the
Hoover Institution, believes that the
announcement "has created a profound
effect," and that trade between the two
nations "will open up." He notes,
however, that "trade will not become
of a great quantity due to China's
economic limitations."

Professor Gurley took a less sanguine
view of the importance of trade in the
rapprochement. For the last four years,
businessmen have been beating a
weekly trail to Washington lobbying for
a rapprochement.
"Our [the U.S. government's] major
aim," Gurley pointed out, "is to
maintain East Asia as a profitable area
for investments. Therefore we need to
stabilize it. If we can convince the
Chinese to help us do so, just as when
we divided up much of the rest of the
world with the Soviet Union, our
interests will be served. China is
potentially a huge market. Japan
alone does almost a billion dollars a
year in exports to China, and West
Germany, England, France, Italy and
Canada are also developing Chinese
markets. Businessmen here want in on
that trade too."
"Chinese economic interests could
be served too," Gurley explained, "if
by opening relations with the U.S. they
change the balance of investments in
East Asia. It's just a speculation,"
Gurley went on, "but, to take an
example, Japanese businessmen cur
rently have large investments in Taiwan
and South Korea. The Chinese stipulate
that any businessmen who trade with
them may not do so if they have
investments in these countries. As
China markets are opening up, the
Japanese are becoming more reluctant
to close themselves off from China by
making investments in these countries.
American competition for Chinese
markets could increase this reluctance,
which would have the effect of
weakening Taiwan and South Korea
and perhaps speeding the return of
Taiwan to Mainland China."
Chinese Gain
Professor Yuan Li Wu, of the Hoover
Institution, sees the President's an
nouncement that he would visit China
sometime in the future as a "gain from
the Chinese point of view. The whole
series of steps began with the ping-pong
team and was preceded by Chinese
efforts to restore itself with the outside
world.
"All of this," Wu continued, "is a
concerted effort to open up relations

with the West. The Chinese have a great
deal to gain and they have made a
score."
According to Wu, China is trying to
create a new image in the world, while,
at the same time, making it difficult for
any nation to attack it without
expecting serious political conse
quences.
"I think that in the short run, we can
look forward to some gives [by China]
in the Vietnam front. We must be
careful, however. One has to reserve
judgement to see what's coming."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese
relationships, Wu commended, "Many
people ignore one important factor.
That being that the Chinese fear the
Soviet Union."

weakness. If he goes there Hanoi might
very well turn over the prisoners of war
directly to him. They can afford it.
They want the war over and the U.S.
out of the country. If they have to get
us out by playing up to Nixon's grand
gesture, well, why not? Victory is
victory."
Opening of Trade
Professor John Emmerson, of the
Hoover Institution, believes that the
announcement "has created a profound
effect," and that trade between the two
nations "will open up." He notes,
however, that "trade will not become
of a great quantity due to China's
economic limitations."

Professor Gurley took a less sanguine
view of the importance of trade in the
rapprochement. For the last four years,
businessmen have been beating a
weekly trail to Washington lobbying for
a rapprochement.
"Our [the U.S. government's] major
aim," Gurley pointed out, "is to
maintain East Asia as a profitable area
for investments. Therefore we need to
stabilize it. If we can convince the
Chinese to help us do so, just as when
we divided up much of the rest of the
world with the Soviet Union, our
interests will be served. China is
potentially a huge market. Japan
alone does almost a billion dollars a
year in exports to China, and West
Germany, England, France, Italy and
Canada are also developing Chinese
markets. Businessmen here want in on
that trade too."
"Chinese economic interests could
be served too," Gurley explained, "if
by opening relations with the U.S. they
change the balance of investments in
East Asia. It's just a speculation,"
Gurley went on, "but, to take an
example, Japanese businessmen cur
rently have large investments in Taiwan
and South Korea. The Chinese stipulate
that any businessmen who trade with
them may not do so if they have
investments in these countries. As
China markets are opening up, the
Japanese are becoming more reluctant
to close themselves off from China by
making investments in these countries.
American competition for Chinese
markets could increase this reluctance,
which would have the effect of
weakening Taiwan and South Korea
and perhaps speeding the return of
Taiwan to Mainland China."
Chinese Gain
Professor Yuan Li Wu, of the Hoover
Institution, sees the President's an
nouncement that he would visit China
sometime in the future as a "gain from
the Chinese point of view. The whole
series of steps began with the ping-pong
team and was preceded by Chinese
efforts to restore itself with the outside
world.
"All of this," Wu continued, "is a
concerted effort to open up relations

with the West. The Chinese have a great
deal to gain and they have made a
score."
According to Wu, China is trying to
create a new image in the world, while,
at the same time, making it difficult for
any nation to attack it without
expecting serious political conse
quences.
"I think that in the short run, we can
look forward to some gives [by China]
in the Vietnam front. We must be
careful, however. One has to reserve
judgement to see what's coming."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese
relationships, Wu commended, "Many
people ignore one important factor.
That being that the Chinese fear the
Soviet Union."


ON THE BEACH-Just in case you expect the Daily to capture the true spirit of summer, we thought we'd better run some
pictures of the beach. But Pescadero and San Gregorio are nothing but boring expanses of sand So we went to the
boardwalk at Santa Cruz—complete with roller coaster, kewpie dolls, hot dogs, et al.
Asian experts at Stanford are fram
ing their own analyses of President
Nixon's surprising announcement that
he will soon visit the People's Republic
of China.
Prof. John Gurley, of the Economics
Department pointed to the end of the
Indochinese conflict as a major motiva
tion for Nixon's decision. "The clue,"
Gurley said, "may lie in Senator Hugh
Scott's statement that before Nixon
goes to China, all combat troops will be
out of Indochina. That could be part of
a deal being worked out."
"I can see two other important
reasons for Nixon's decision," Gurley
went on. "One is that China is now a
nuclear power. They're strong. They
have to be reckoned with. The other is
that there has been pressure on Nixon
for a long time from the business
community to open up China to trade.
Chinese Misread
Prof. John Lewis, of East Asian
Studies, also emphasized Vietnam,
stating that "I think the trip is a
tremendous step forward but, several
more steps are needed. The United
States will have to have taken steps
toward Indochina in order to make it
more than just an exchange of pleasant
ries. Unless these things are done,
Peking will be in a box, because it will
find itself pressured. They can't be used
in that way. The Chinese were always
misread. They are hard-headed, practi
cal revolutionaries.
"This has been in the works for a
good long time. It can be traced to a
series of policies by the Nixon Admin
istration. The Administration is follow
ing a normalization of policy with
Peking."
President Nixon's trip to China,
according to Lewis, is further proof
that "China will be in the United
Nations by this fall."
Nixon Saving Face
Banning Garrett, of Concerned Asian
Scholars, analyzed the situation from a
different perspective. "This is a sign of
weakness on Nixon's part," he said.
"He knows he has lost in Indochina and
will have to get out. He hopes to save

face as best he can. If he can parlay the
Indochinese loss into a rapprochement
with China, he will come off as the
great peacemaker, and possibly save his
political scalp.
"It is clear," Garrett went on, "that
the Chinese are on the offensive right
now. They are strong. They have
consolidated the cultural revolution.
They are winning in Vietnam. If they
can drive a hard bargain with Nixon
they will probably get the U.S. out of
South East Asia militarily, possibly
slow down the rearmament of Japan
which is worrying them, and maybe
even get Taiwan back. They can afford
to let Nixon save a little face. Besides,
if theyhelp to make peace in Indochina,
it will also be a sign of their friendliness
with the majority of American people,
who don't want the war either.
"The Chinese, are dedicated to the
prevention of World War III," Garrett
continued. They have stated as a matter
of policy that it is the duty of all
revolutionaries to insure peace on an
international level while promoting
revolution at a local level. Thus, by
opening up relations between
themselves and the U.S., they have put
a wedge between the Americans and
the Russians which will make it less
likely that these two countries will join
together to attack China. This then
means more security for China, which
allows them a greater freedom to
pursue their political aims.
"There has been some talk recently
of Nixon going to Hanoi," Garrett
added. "This is another sign of Nixon's
weakness. If he goes there Hanoi might
very well turn over the prisoners of war

boardwalk at Santa Cruz—complete with roller coaster, kewpie dolls, hot dogs, et al.
Asian experts at Stanford are fram
ing their own analyses of President
Nixon's surprising announcement that
he will soon visit the People's Republic
of China.
Prof. John Gurley, of the Economics
Department pointed to the end of the
Indochinese conflict as a major motiva
tion for Nixon's decision. "The clue,"
Gurley said, "may lie in Senator Hugh
Scott's statement that before Nixon
goes to China, all combat troops will be
out of Indochina. That could be part of
a deal being worked out."
"I can see two other important
reasons for Nixon's decision," Gurley
went on. "One is that China is now a
nuclear power. They're strong. They
have to be reckoned with. The other is
that there has been pressure on Nixon
for a long time from the business
community to open up China to trade.
Chinese Misread
Prof. John Lewis, of East Asian
Studies, also emphasized Vietnam,
stating that "I think the trip is a
tremendous step forward but, several
more steps are needed. The United
States will have to have taken steps
toward Indochina in order to make it
more than just an exchange of pleasant
ries. Unless these things are done,
Peking will be in a box, because it will
find itself pressured. They can't be used
in that way. The Chinese were always
misread. They are hard-headed, practi
cal revolutionaries.
"This has been in the works for a
good long time. It can be traced to a
series of policies by the Nixon Admin
istration. The Administration is follow
ing a normalization of policy with
Peking."
President Nixon's trip to China,
according to Lewis, is further proof
that "China will be in the United
Nations by this fall."
Nixon Saving Face
Banning Garrett, of Concerned Asian
Scholars, analyzed the situation from a
different perspective. "This is a sign of
weakness on Nixon's part," he said.
"He knows he has lost in Indochina and
will have to get out. He hopes to save

face as best he can. If he can parlay the
Indochinese loss into a rapprochement
with China, he will come off as the
great peacemaker, and possibly save his
political scalp.
"It is clear," Garrett went on, "that
the Chinese are on the offensive right
now. They are strong. They have
consolidated the cultural revolution.
They are winning in Vietnam. If they
can drive a hard bargain with Nixon
they will probably get the U.S. out of
South East Asia militarily, possibly
slow down the rearmament of Japan
which is worrying them, and maybe
even get Taiwan back. They can afford
to let Nixon save a little face. Besides,
if theyhelp to make peace in Indochina,
it will also be a sign of their friendliness
with the majority of American people,
who don't want the war either.
"The Chinese, are dedicated to the
prevention of World War III," Garrett
continued. They have stated as a matter
of policy that it is the duty of all
revolutionaries to insure peace on an
international level while promoting
revolution at a local level. Thus, by
opening up relations between
themselves and the U.S., they have put
a wedge between the Americans and
the Russians which will make it less
likely that these two countries will join
together to attack China. This then
means more security for China, which
allows them a greater freedom to
pursue their political aims.
"There has been some talk recently
of Nixon going to Hanoi," Garrett
added. "This is another sign of Nixon's
weakness. If he goes there Hanoi might
very well turn over the prisoners of war
directly to him. They can afford it.
They want the war over and the U.S.
out of the country. If they have to get
us out by playing up to Nixon's grand
gesture, well, why not? Victory is
victory."
Opening of Trade
Professor John Emmerson, of the
Hoover Institution, believes that the
announcement "has created a profound
effect," and that trade between the two
nations "will open up." He notes,
however, that "trade will not become
of a great quantity due to China's
economic limitations."

Professor Gurley took a less sanguine
view of the importance of trade in the
rapprochement. For the last four years,
businessmen have been beating a
weekly trail to Washington lobbying for
a rapprochement.
"Our [the U.S. government's] major
aim," Gurley pointed out, "is to
maintain East Asia as a profitable area
for investments. Therefore we need to
stabilize it. If we can convince the
Chinese to help us do so, just as when
we divided up much of the rest of the
world with the Soviet Union, our
interests will be served. China is
potentially a huge market. Japan
alone does almost a billion dollars a
year in exports to China, and West
Germany, England, France, Italy and
Canada are also developing Chinese
markets. Businessmen here want in on
that trade too."
"Chinese economic interests could
be served too," Gurley explained, "if
by opening relations with the U.S. they
change the balance of investments in
East Asia. It's just a speculation,"
Gurley went on, "but, to take an
example, Japanese businessmen cur
rently have large investments in Taiwan
and South Korea. The Chinese stipulate
that any businessmen who trade with
them may not do so if they have
investments in these countries. As
China markets are opening up, the
Japanese are becoming more reluctant
to close themselves off from China by
making investments in these countries.
American competition for Chinese
markets could increase this reluctance,
which would have the effect of
weakening Taiwan and South Korea
and perhaps speeding the return of
Taiwan to Mainland China."
Chinese Gain
Professor Yuan Li Wu, of the Hoover
Institution, sees the President's an
nouncement that he would visit China
sometime in the future as a "gain from
the Chinese point of view. The whole
series of steps began with the ping-pong
team and was preceded by Chinese
efforts to restore itself with the outside
world.
"All of this," Wu continued, "is a
concerted effort to open up relations

with the West. The Chinese have a great
deal to gain and they have made a
score."
According to Wu, China is trying to
create a new image in the world, while,
at the same time, making it difficult for
any nation to attack it without
expecting serious political conse
quences.
"I think that in the short run, we can
look forward to some gives [by China]
in the Vietnam front. We must be
careful, however. One has to reserve
judgement to see what's coming."
On the subject of Soviet-Chinese
relationships, Wu commended, "Many
people ignore one important factor.
That being that the Chinese fear the
Soviet Union."
