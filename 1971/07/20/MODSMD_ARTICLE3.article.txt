# Advisory Committee Split Delays Selection Of New Police Chief
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Conflicting recommendations from
an advisory committee have caused a
delay in picking Stanford's new police
chief.
Provost William Miller yesterday said
the administration is still trying to
chose between two candidates to head
the campus security police. The de
cision was scheduled to be made July
15.
The Daily has learned a ten-member
presidential advisory committee was
"close to evenly split" among the two
primary candidates whose names ad
ministrators submitted to them. The
Presidential Advisory Committee on
the Role of Campus Police includes
three students, three faculty members,
three employees, and a faculty home
owner.
The three students and at least one
other member were on one side of the
committee split after two-hour inter

views with the candidates. Neither
committee members nor administrators
would release details about the candi
dates or the nature of the split, pending
a decision on the new chief.
Administrators last week phoned
vacationing President Richard Lyman
in Vienna and read him the entire
six-page committee report during the
long-distance telephone call. Miller said
Lyman told him to talk to the two
candidates again and make a decision.
The Provost was scheduled to meet
with the second candidate last night.
Apparently referring to the split
decision, Miller said, "With a close call
like that, you have to give it a second
look."
The police committee is purely
advisory, and Lyman gave it no official
power in the selection process. But
student member Larry Diamond said,
"We think it's a very good sign that
they're giving this much attention to
the committee recommendations. The

administration is obviously taking this
selection very seriously."
The students and their committee
allies are apparently still definite in
their preference for one candidate. But
one student said they have received an
encouraging report which has lessened
their opposition to the candidate they
did not recommend.
The future of Stanford's campus
police has been an open question since
Chief Thomas Bell resigned in April
under criticism from the University
administration. The advisory commit
tee is continuing its study of future
status for the campus department.
A Stanford-initiated bill, which
would allow campus security guards
full police powers they now lack, is
expected to be voted on by the State
Assembly's Ways and Means Committee
this week. Santa Clara Sheriff's Sgt.
Donald Tamm, whose department op
poses the bill, was in Sacramento
yesterday lobbying against the bill.
