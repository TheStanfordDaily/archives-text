# Summer Students Hope To Stay

There is a small, relatively unobstru
sive statement on the summer admis
sion form of each undergraduate
summer visitor which explicitly states
that admission to the summer quarter
"does not allow candidacy for a degree
at Stanford."
Many summer students, however,
have chosen to ignore that statement
and have entered the summer session
believing that if they receive good
grades and demonstrate an ability to
handle the work load they will have an
easier time getting into the school on a
permanent basis.
"If you take a normal course load,"
explained high school senior Rob
Martin, "and prove you have the
capability to handle it... well, that's
all there is to it."
"If you get A's in your courses and
you're a borderline-case," contended
high school senior Marc Goldstein,
"coming here over the summer can't
hurt."
But university officials are adament
in their belief that summer visitors will
get no special consideration when they
apply for permanent admission. "It

would have no effect on the applica
tion," affirmed John Bunnell, director
of operations.
"It would be evaluated as summer
work," continued Bunnell, "and it
would not necessarily improve the
applicants' chances. It is not a selling
point."
Bunnell did, however, admit that "if
a Stanford professor wanted to write to

us in the applicant's behalf' it would
be "something we'd consider."
Despite the apparent finality of the
university stand, at least one high
school senior doubts the university's
contention. "Any college likes you to
go to another college over the sum
mer," commended the East Coast high
school visitor, "and besides, I'm getting
good grades here."
