Today is July 20, 1971. On this date, in the year 300 8.C.,
the Mayan calendar was invented in Yucatan. According to the
Mayans, the solar year has a duration of 365.24 days, and the
lunar month 29.52 days. This was a significant improvement
over the older calendars of Babylon, Assyria, Egypt, and
Greece. However, due to restrictive copyright laws, and the fact
that Roman Republic, at the time the ascendant power in the
Mediterranean, refused to sanction non-European time conven
tions, the Mayan calendar failed to catch on east of the Antilles.
