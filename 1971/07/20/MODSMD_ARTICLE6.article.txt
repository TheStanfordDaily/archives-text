## Gerald P. Nye, Lockheed- R.I.P. 
### 
bill everB

The newspapers yesterday car
ried news of the death of former
Senator Gerald P. Nye (R-N.D.).
Nye was one of the great foes of
militarism and defenders of liber
ty in recent American history.
The Nye Committee hearings
conducted after World War I were
a major contribution toward
American disillusionment with
military intervention in foreign
countries.
Nye was a leading opponent of
American entry into World War 11.
He opposed the draft and Presi
dent Franklin Roosevelt's "Lend-
Lease" program of aid to the
Allied Powers.
Nye was one of the drafters of
the Neutrality Act, which unsuc
cessfully sought to halt the
shipment of American arms to
belligerents. Nye called Imperial
Britain "the greatest aggressor of
modern times."
The Midwest isolationist was

also a defender of the domestic
freedoms of U.S. citizens. Accord
ing to the July 19 New York
Times, "to him . . . the Blue Eagle
of the National Industrial Recov
ery Act wasn 'a bird of prey upon
the masses,' in his view fostering
monopoly and price-fixing and
suspending the antitrust laws."
Nye's finest hour was the 1934
Senate investigation into the mu
nitions industry and its banking
Companies like E.I. du
l\jnt de Nemours & Co. and J.P.
Morgan & Co. came under his
merciless scrutiny.
Nye's probe was a public airing
of the activities of the merchants
of death which remained unrival
ed until the investigations of men
like Senator Proxmire in recent
years.

The July 13 New York Times
published an interview with Wil
liam Henry Moore, the chairman

of Bankers Trust (one of 24 banks
which together have lent $400
million to Lockheed). The Times'
first question was "Why should
the Government guarantee a loan
to Lockheed?"
Mr. Moore's answer: "I believe
that we have now come along to
the time when the Government
and the private sector, for the
good of the United States, are
going to have to join hands in
many projects. Now this is a
rather Boy Scouty statement, but,
really, I sincerely believe it.
"Basically there isn't a private
enterprise company or organiza
tion that isn't now receiving help
or about to get help. The steel and
textile people, for instance, they
want help from the point of view
of quotas. The farm people have
been helped for years.
"Also, we're not talking about
big guys and little guys. We've got
S.B.A.'s [guarantees by the Small
Business Administration J that
have been running for a helluva
long time. So I think the concept
is nothing that really strikes at the
heart of private enterprise at all."
Right to Welfare
Or, as a Times editorial subse
quently restated Moore's position:
"In brief, big corporations have as
much right to welfare as anyone
else." The editorial went on to
describe the proposed federal loan
guarantee program as "a new
R.F.C. [Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, which existed
1932-53], with all the dangers of
political decision-making where
vast private economic interests are
involved, and all the risks of
furthering a trend toward state
socialism or corporate fascism."

The July 18 New York Times
business section carried the story
of the Italian equivalent of Ameri
ca's Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration—the Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale. "The
1.R.1, was founded in 1933, under
Mussolini, to end the country's
continual banking crises. Alberto
Beneduce, a militant socialist and
big banker, engineered a financial
rescue plan whereby the state
took over all the long-term assets
of the larger banks, thereby
acquiring industrial holdings
covering."
Abortive Efforts
An editorial comment in the
June 29 National Review:
"We would like to think that
the Nixon Administration had
learned a lesson from its abortive
efforts last year to shield the Penn
Central from bankruptcy ...
What is now before Congress is
the Administration's proposal that
the U.S. Treasury should guaran
tee a $250 million loan to
Lockheed, the nation's largest
defense contractor.
"No one who has followed the
chronic struggles to close down
inefficient Army arsenals or Navy
shipyards will be greatly surprised
at the staying power of an
enterprise that has demonstrated a
persistent inability to meet the
requirements of its primary cus
tomer, the Department of De
fense.
"And now that Lockheed has
ventured forth into the free
market with its airbus, the
L-1011, and has fallen flat on its
face, does the government havy an
obligation to pick the giant off

the floor"? NR is unable to find
any."

The June 14 issue of the Nation
contains an interesting review of
the Selected Writings of General
Vo Nguyen Giap.
Historian Leonard Liggio points
out that "General Giap's analysis
of the situation in South Vietnam
is . . . cast essentially in terms of
the vital land question. '[The]
revolutionary upsurge is in essence
an insurrectionary movement of
the mass of peasants, in which
they carry out successive upris
ings, to take power at the base
and regain the right to land
ownership.'
"Under Diem, two-thirds of the
land which had been gained by
the peasants in South Vietnam
during the war against the French
was restored to the [feudal]
landlords. Heavy taxation, mili
tary and labor conscription and
judicial terror sustained the land
lords' mastery." Peasant bolshe
viks are agrarian reformers attack
ing feudalism.

A New York Times editorial of
July 14 merits reprinting: "The
rights guaranteed to the American
people by the First Amendment
were reaffirmed once more yester
day when the House sent back to
the Commerce Committee a pro
posed contempt-of-Congress cita
tion against the Columbia Broad
casting System and its president,
Dr. Frank Stanton.
The 226-181 vote was a de
served if unusual rebuff to Com
merce chairman Harley O. Stag
gers, Democrat of West Virginia,

for his misbegotten effort to
compel C.B.S. to turn over unused
material compiled for its docu
mentary, 'The Selling of the
Pentagon.'
"The merits of that controver
sial production were not at issue.
The House has recognized, as Mr.
Staggers did not, the very clear
constitutional prohibition against
such interference with the free
dom of the press as applied to
electronic journalism."

The June 14 issue of the Nation
contains an interesting review of
the Selected Writings of General
Vo Nguyen Giap.
Historian Leonard Liggio points
out that "General Giap's analysis
of the situation in South Vietnam
is . . . cast essentially in terms of
the vital land question. '[The]
revolutionary upsurge is in essence
an insurrectionary movement of
the mass of peasants, in which
they carry out successive upris
ings, to take power at the base
and regain the right to land
ownership.'
"Under Diem, two-thirds of the
land which had been gained by
the peasants in South Vietnam
during the war against the French
was restored to the [feudal]
landlords. Heavy taxation, mili
tary and labor conscription and
judicial terror sustained the land
lords' mastery." Peasant bolshe
viks are agrarian reformers attack
ing feudalism.

The newspapers yesterday car
ried news of the death of former
Senator Gerald P. Nye (R-N.D.).
Nye was one of the great foes of
militarism and defenders of liber
ty in recent American history.
The Nye Committee hearings
conducted after World War I were
a major contribution toward
American disillusionment with
military intervention in foreign
countries.
Nye was a leading opponent of
American entry into World War 11.
He opposed the draft and Presi
dent Franklin Roosevelt's "Lend-
Lease" program of aid to the
Allied Powers.
Nye was one of the drafters of
the Neutrality Act, which unsuc
cessfully sought to halt the
shipment of American arms to
belligerents. Nye called Imperial
Britain "the greatest aggressor of
modern times."
The Midwest isolationist was

also a defender of the domestic
freedoms of U.S. citizens. Accord
ing to the July 19 New York
Times, "to him . . . the Blue Eagle
of the National Industrial Recov
ery Act wasn 'a bird of prey upon
the masses,' in his view fostering
monopoly and price-fixing and
suspending the antitrust laws."
Nye's finest hour was the 1934
Senate investigation into the mu
nitions industry and its banking
Companies like E.I. du
l\jnt de Nemours & Co. and J.P.
Morgan & Co. came under his
merciless scrutiny.
Nye's probe was a public airing
of the activities of the merchants
of death which remained unrival
ed until the investigations of men
like Senator Proxmire in recent
years.

The July 13 New York Times
published an interview with Wil
liam Henry Moore, the chairman

of Bankers Trust (one of 24 banks
which together have lent $400
million to Lockheed). The Times'
first question was "Why should
the Government guarantee a loan
to Lockheed?"
Mr. Moore's answer: "I believe
that we have now come along to
the time when the Government
and the private sector, for the
good of the United States, are
going to have to join hands in
many projects. Now this is a
rather Boy Scouty statement, but,
really, I sincerely believe it.
"Basically there isn't a private
enterprise company or organiza
tion that isn't now receiving help
or about to get help. The steel and
textile people, for instance, they
want help from the point of view
of quotas. The farm people have
been helped for years.
"Also, we're not talking about
big guys and little guys. We've got
S.B.A.'s [guarantees by the Small
Business Administration J that
have been running for a helluva
long time. So I think the concept
is nothing that really strikes at the
heart of private enterprise at all."
Right to Welfare
Or, as a Times editorial subse
quently restated Moore's position:
"In brief, big corporations have as
much right to welfare as anyone
else." The editorial went on to
describe the proposed federal loan
guarantee program as "a new
R.F.C. [Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, which existed
1932-53], with all the dangers of
political decision-making where
vast private economic interests are
involved, and all the risks of
furthering a trend toward state
socialism or corporate fascism."

The July 18 New York Times
business section carried the story
of the Italian equivalent of Ameri
ca's Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration—the Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale. "The
1.R.1, was founded in 1933, under
Mussolini, to end the country's
continual banking crises. Alberto
Beneduce, a militant socialist and
big banker, engineered a financial
rescue plan whereby the state
took over all the long-term assets
of the larger banks, thereby
acquiring industrial holdings
covering."
Abortive Efforts
An editorial comment in the
June 29 National Review:
"We would like to think that
the Nixon Administration had
learned a lesson from its abortive
efforts last year to shield the Penn
Central from bankruptcy ...
What is now before Congress is
the Administration's proposal that
the U.S. Treasury should guaran
tee a $250 million loan to
Lockheed, the nation's largest
defense contractor.
"No one who has followed the
chronic struggles to close down
inefficient Army arsenals or Navy
shipyards will be greatly surprised

Mr. Moore's answer: "I believe
that we have now come along to
the time when the Government
and the private sector, for the
good of the United States, are
going to have to join hands in
many projects. Now this is a
rather Boy Scouty statement, but,
really, I sincerely believe it.
"Basically there isn't a private
enterprise company or organiza
tion that isn't now receiving help
or about to get help. The steel and
textile people, for instance, they
want help from the point of view
of quotas. The farm people have
been helped for years.
"Also, we're not talking about
big guys and little guys. We've got
S.B.A.'s [guarantees by the Small
Business Administration J that
have been running for a helluva
long time. So I think the concept
is nothing that really strikes at the
heart of private enterprise at all."
Right to Welfare
Or, as a Times editorial subse
quently restated Moore's position:
"In brief, big corporations have as
much right to welfare as anyone
else." The editorial went on to
describe the proposed federal loan
guarantee program as "a new
R.F.C. [Reconstruction Finance
Corporation, which existed
1932-53], with all the dangers of
political decision-making where
vast private economic interests are
involved, and all the risks of
furthering a trend toward state
socialism or corporate fascism."

The July 18 New York Times
business section carried the story
of the Italian equivalent of Ameri
ca's Reconstruction Finance Cor
poration—the Istituto per la
Ricostruzione Industriale. "The
1.R.1, was founded in 1933, under
Mussolini, to end the country's
continual banking crises. Alberto
Beneduce, a militant socialist and
big banker, engineered a financial
rescue plan whereby the state
took over all the long-term assets
of the larger banks, thereby
acquiring industrial holdings
covering."
Abortive Efforts
An editorial comment in the
June 29 National Review:
"We would like to think that
the Nixon Administration had
learned a lesson from its abortive
efforts last year to shield the Penn
Central from bankruptcy ...
What is now before Congress is
the Administration's proposal that
the U.S. Treasury should guaran
tee a $250 million loan to
Lockheed, the nation's largest
defense contractor.
"No one who has followed the
chronic struggles to close down
inefficient Army arsenals or Navy
shipyards will be greatly surprised
at the staying power of an
enterprise that has demonstrated a
persistent inability to meet the
requirements of its primary cus
tomer, the Department of De
fense.
"And now that Lockheed has
ventured forth into the free
market with its airbus, the
L-1011, and has fallen flat on its
face, does the government havy an
obligation to pick the giant off

the floor"? NR is unable to find
any."

The June 14 issue of the Nation
contains an interesting review of
the Selected Writings of General
Vo Nguyen Giap.
Historian Leonard Liggio points
out that "General Giap's analysis
of the situation in South Vietnam
is . . . cast essentially in terms of
the vital land question. '[The]
revolutionary upsurge is in essence
an insurrectionary movement of
the mass of peasants, in which
they carry out successive upris
ings, to take power at the base
and regain the right to land
ownership.'
"Under Diem, two-thirds of the
land which had been gained by
the peasants in South Vietnam
during the war against the French
was restored to the [feudal]
landlords. Heavy taxation, mili
tary and labor conscription and
judicial terror sustained the land
lords' mastery." Peasant bolshe
viks are agrarian reformers attack
ing feudalism.

A New York Times editorial of
July 14 merits reprinting: "The
rights guaranteed to the American
people by the First Amendment
were reaffirmed once more yester
day when the House sent back to
the Commerce Committee a pro
posed contempt-of-Congress cita
tion against the Columbia Broad
casting System and its president,
Dr. Frank Stanton.
The 226-181 vote was a de

merce chairman Harley O. Stag
gers, Democrat of West Virginia,

for his misbegotten effort to
compel C.B.S. to turn over unused
material compiled for its docu
mentary, 'The Selling of the
Pentagon.'
"The merits of that controver

constitutional prohibition against
such interference with the free

The newspapers yesterday car
ried news of the death of former
Senator Gerald P. Nye (R-N.D.).
Nye was one of the great foes of
militarism and defenders of liber
ty in recent American history.
The Nye Committee hearings
conducted after World War I were
a major contribution toward
American disillusionment with
military intervention in foreign
countries.
Nye was a leading opponent of
American entry into World War 11.
He opposed the draft and Presi
dent Franklin Roosevelt's "Lend-
Lease" program of aid to the
Allied Powers.
Nye was one of the drafters of
the Neutrality Act, which unsuc
cessfully sought to halt the
shipment of American arms to
belligerents. Nye called Imperial
Britain "the greatest aggressor of
modern times."
The Midwest isolationist was

also a defender of the domestic
freedoms of U.S. citizens. Accord
ing to the July 19 New York
Times, "to him . . . the Blue Eagle
of the National Industrial Recov
ery Act wasn 'a bird of prey upon
the masses,' in his view fostering
monopoly and price-fixing and
suspending the antitrust laws."
Nye's finest hour was the 1934
Senate investigation into the mu
nitions industry and its banking
Companies like E.I. du
l\jnt de Nemours & Co. and J.P.
Morgan & Co. came under his
merciless scrutiny.
Nye's probe was a public airing
of the activities of the merchants
of death which remained unrival
ed until the investigations of men
like Senator Proxmire in recent
years.
