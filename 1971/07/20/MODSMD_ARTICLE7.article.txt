# Women's Forum
## 
### 
"Of all the social revolutions now abroad in the world, that
of the American woman is the least dynamic, the least
predictable, the most aimless and divided—in short the most
feminine."
That is what "Life" Magazine had to say about women's
liberation—in 1945. Things have sure changed on the opinion
scene since then—or have they?
The Daily is looking for answers to this and to other
questions. Next week we will run a forum on the Woman
Question. We welcome all opinions on the subject, be you for
or against, man or woman.
Please submit material to the Daily, typed, on a 60-space
line double-spaced, by this Friday, July 23, at 6 p.m. in care of
the Opinions Page Editor or the Women's Page Assistant
Editor-at-Large, Ed Kohn.
As always, the Daily reserves the right to edit material in
