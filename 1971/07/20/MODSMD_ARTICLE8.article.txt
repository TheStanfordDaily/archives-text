## Dolly Discovers Catch-22 
###

"What?" Yossarian froze in his
tracks ... "What did you say?"
"Catch-22," the old woman
repeated, rocking her head up and
down. "Catch-22. Catch-22 says
they have the right to do anything
we can Y stop them from doing. "
Like the protagonist of Heller's
faous novel, a lot of people who
work at Stanford have come to
realize that the grievance proce
dure as applied in recent weeks
resembles the crude manipulations

of a circus side show.
First, we have the Alice in
Wonderland situation of sentence
first, verdict afterwards. That is, a
worker is fired first, then offered
a grievance hearing. Second, we
have every indication that the
President's office also intends to
function, in these cases, not only
as the prosecution but also as
judge and jury.
No Power
The grievance procedure as

outlined in guide memo 22.10 was
developed to provide a last resort
for disgruntled employees and was
never intended to operate as an
arbitration panel between the
University administration and its
workers.
The administration in these
situations might well be looked
upon as a disinterested third
party. This is anything but the
case in the Dolly hearing. It was
Personnel Director, Robert Nel
son, who fired Mr. Dolly over and
above the bitter objections of the
department chairman, Mr. Dolly's
supervisor and fellow employees.
Useless Process
The hollow re-iteration by
some University administrators
that mistreated employees have
recourse to the grievance proce
dure may make for good copy in
Campus Report, but considering
the useless nature of the whole
process anyway, it must leave
those who have been deprived of
their livelihood less than reassur
ed.
The reality of the Dolly case is
that the same administration that
performed the firings, dictates the
guidelines under which the review
committee will operate, presents
the case against Mr. Dolly and
then, as if that weren't enough,
exercises a final Catch-22—the
whole idiocy is only a recommen
dation to itself anyway.
