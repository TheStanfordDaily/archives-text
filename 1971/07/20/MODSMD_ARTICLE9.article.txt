## Terrorism Destroys Unity 
###

Whoever planted the bomb at
the home of University personnel
director Robert Nelson was either
very smart or very stupid.
Understanding which is the case
is of importance not only to those
who advocate or approve of
revolutionary violence, but also to
those who condemn it, either for
tactical or for moral reasons. How
else can an individual know how
to react to it?
Let us, make the assumption,
for the sake of discussion that
since the bomb was set the day
before Nelson was due to testify
before the first greivance hearing
(John Dolly's) in the cases of the
5 workers fired by Mr. Nelson for
alleged participation in the April 9
sit-in, there is some connection,
however tenuous, between the
motives for the bombing and the
firing of the workers.
If we make the assumption that
the bombing is connected with
the firings, then speculation about
motives and ends winds up with
two kinds of people who might
have set the bomb: those who
support the workers and feel such
an act would further their cause,
and those who oppose the work
ers and are trying to isolate them
from the growing support in the
community.
Chose To Fight
Now John Dolly, who was fired
from a job as a laboratory
assistant in the Medical School,
has chosen to fight for his job by
going through channels in the
grievance procedure. Associate
Professor of English, Bruce Frank
lin, who has his own dismissal to
worry about, has agreed to serve
Dolly's grievance representative.
Many faculty and staff have
indicated their willingness to testi
fy on Dolly's behalf, and have
already spent long hours trying to
reason with University officials
about the unreasonability of sum
marily firing John.
Anyone close to the case knows
that much of the information
gathered in investigation and be
hind-the-scenes-meetings with ad
ministrators as to the violations of

procedures, the overturning of
traditions, the rigidities of the
administration, and the denials of
and attempts to prevert constitu
tional rights of workers, is about
to be brought out publicly during
the grievance hearings.
Anyone close to the case knows
that such information will be
powerful instruction for the com
munity in the ways in which the
adminstrators operate to maintain
and enlarge their administrative
power, much the same way as the
exposure of the Pentagon papers
taught the American public a
lesson which will not easily be
unlearned.
Smoke Screen
Thus anyone close to the case
who would set a bomb at Robert
Nelson's house should have seen
that such an act particularly at
this time, could only serve to
destroy the strategy embarked
upon by the workers who were
fired.
First it would set up a smoke
screen of sympathy for Nelson
behind which he could hide the
weakness of his case, and second
it would destroy the alliance with
the middle people, who, at an
extreme minimum, could not
accept a retaliative act before
administrative procedures had
been exhausted.
On the other hand, someone on
the right, be he serving as
infiltrator (provacateur) or simply
acting on his own to sabatoge the
greivance procedings would have
been exceptionally smart to bomb
Nelson's house or get others to do
it.
Political Violence
The arguments for using vio
lence to force political change
have been made by many people
on many sides: President Nixon
when he says we must bomb the

Vietnamese, the Israelis when
they terrorized the British to
liberate Palestine for Israel, the
Cubans, the Chinese, the Ameri
cans in the American Revolution,
even President Lyman and his
staff when they chose to force the
people out of the hospital corri
dor rather than settling the sit-in
peaceably by accepting the com
promise of simply appointing a
grievance board, and setting a date
for the hearing for the black
worker whose firing started the
whole thing.
It is a strange paradox that
those who cry loudest to suppress
political violence use violence to
gain their own ends.
This is a University, and it
should therefore be dedicated to
understanding and solving the
major problems of our times.
Right now, from Ellsberg to
Venceremos, many people have
turned to breaking the law as the
only way to face their patriotic
consciences in a country run
out-of-control managers willing,
apparently, to do almost anything
they can get away with.
Stage Set
The stage has been set for the
crucial debate. The question:
Resolved that those in power, by
virtue of the primary dedication
to staying in power, cannot and
will not allow a more equitable
distribution of that power, and
therefore must be forcibly re
moved in order to relieve the
oppression of the people of this

country and the world.
How does it happen that the
University, under the direction of
its President, is seeking to purge
itself of one of the prime
advocates of that position, Bruce
Franklin, and others who think
somewhat like him? Are we
afraid the system held so dear can
only be defended by force and
oppression?
Let me make myself clear. I do
not condemn all revolutionary
violenceâ€” to do so would by to
turn my back on my heritage as
an American.
I do not condemn the resort to
law breaking and violence in our
time, if it is the only choice to
tyranny. But I do condemn
actions which are destructive to
the building of a large united
front, which is absolutely neces
sary to bring about change,
whether revolutionary or by
peaceful means.
Little Red Book
If I may be allowed a quote
from Chairman Mao, "The masses
in any given place are generally
composed of three parts, the
relatively active, the intermediates
and the relatively backward.
"The leaders must therefore be
skilled in uniting the small num
ber of active elements around the
leadership and must rely on them
to raise the level of the inter
mediate elements and to win over
the backward elements."
