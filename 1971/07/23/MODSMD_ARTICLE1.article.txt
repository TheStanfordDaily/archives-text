# State College Official To Head Campus Police
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
The security chief for the
California State Colleges will take
over Stanford's police department
August 1. Marvin L. Herrington,
35, was named campus police
chief by administrators Wednes
day.
Herrington headed security
operations in the 19 state colleges
since December, 1970. Before
that, he was chief of North
western University's police for
two years.
Selection of the campus chief
had been delayed since July 15,
after the Committee on the Role
of Campus Police split evenly
between Herrington and another

candidate administrators submit
ted for their advice.
All three student members of
the committee had preferred the
other candidate—who is reported
ly a teacher of police sciences
over Herrington.
Student members said they
were not certain Herrington
would "work as well with stud
ents" as the other candidate.
Student member Larry Diamond
said that after a two-hour inter
view the students "had doubts
about his depth of understanding
about political divisions and pro
tests at Stanford."
But Diamond said he is optimis
tic after hearing positive reports
about Herrington from a North
western University student leader.
Former Northwestern Student
President Eva Jefferson, tele
phoned in Chicago, told the Daily,
"I think Herrington's a fair man
and an honest man and one who's
willing to listen to you."
Jefferson, known for her Sep
tember television debate with
Spiro Agnew, said her occasional
clashes with Herrington came
from their differing political per
spectives. For instance, she said
she disagreed with his decision to
call in outside police for some
demonstrations to which she was
sympathetic.
And she said some students had
opposed Herrington's policy of
photographing protesters, al
though Herrington said his men
only recorded likely or actual
crimes.
Asked about his contacts with
students, Harrington said, "I've
had my ups and downs, but I
always got along with the people
in the community I've worked
for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that com
munity."
Before his Northwestern stint,
Herrington worked his way up
from patrolman to chief of the
police department at the Univer
sity of California at Davis.

At Northwestern Herrington
took over an eight-man security
group and developed it into a
highly-trained 40-man police
department. Administrators evi
dently believe Herrington, whose
new job reportedly pays over
$20,000 a year, can develop
Stanford's weak security forces.
Stanford's last chief, Thomas
Bell, resigned in April when
administrators reportedly became
disenchanted with his work and
he derided them for indecision
about the department's status.
Since then, Stanford has advo
cated a bill, not expected to pass
the legislature, which would give
campus police arrest capability
and other powers they now lack.
Asked about drug law enforce
ment on campuses, Herrington
said, "I don't think you can turn
your whole force into a narcotics
enforcement department."
He said narcotics laws are of
low priority among problems
campus police should worry
about.
He said he will try to under
stand Stanford campus bombings
of recent months. But he said
bombings are hard for police to
deal with because bombings "are
not profit-motive type crimes" in
which police can investigate
material gain or property taken
from the scene.
Herrington said his own officers
sometimes are assigned to plain
clothes investigation, but opposed
using paid informers who are not
police officers.
The new chief said he expects a
good relationship with Stanford
administrators. He pointed to a
clear chain of command, in which
he will report directly to Vice
president for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger and
President Richard Lyman. Chief
Bell at one time reported through
as many as four intermediary
administrators.

department. Administrators evi
dently believe Herrington, whose
new job reportedly pays over
$20,000 a year, can develop
Stanford's weak security forces.
Stanford's last chief, Thomas
Bell, resigned in April when
administrators reportedly became
disenchanted with his work and
he derided them for indecision
about the department's status.
Since then, Stanford has advo
cated a bill, not expected to pass
the legislature, which would give
campus police arrest capability
and other powers they now lack.
Asked about drug law enforce
ment on campuses, Herrington
said, "I don't think you can turn
your whole force into a narcotics
enforcement department."
He said narcotics laws are of
low priority among problems
campus police should worry
about.
He said he will try to under
stand Stanford campus bombings
of recent months. But he said
bombings are hard for police to
deal with because bombings "are
not profit-motive type crimes" in
which police can investigate
material gain or property taken
from the scene.
Herrington said his own officers
sometimes are assigned to plain
clothes investigation, but opposed
using paid informers who are not
police officers.
The new chief said he expects a
good relationship with Stanford
administrators. He pointed to a
clear chain of command, in which
he will report directly to Vice
president for Business and Fi
nance Robert Augsburger and
President Richard Lyman. Chief
Bell at one time reported through
as many as four intermediary
administrators.

WANTED: A new chairman, to conduct grievance hearings for four

The security chief for the
California State Colleges will take
over Stanford's police department
August 1. Marvin L. Herrington,
35, was named campus police
chief by administrators Wednes
day.
Herrington headed security
operations in the 19 state colleges
since December, 1970. Before
that, he was chief of North
western University's police for
two years.
Selection of the campus chief
had been delayed since July 15,
after the Committee on the Role
of Campus Police split evenly
between Herrington and another

candidate administrators submit
ted for their advice.
All three student members of
the committee had preferred the
other candidate—who is reported
ly a teacher of police sciences
over Herrington.
Student members said they
were not certain Herrington
would "work as well with stud
ents" as the other candidate.
Student member Larry Diamond
said that after a two-hour inter
view the students "had doubts
about his depth of understanding
about political divisions and pro
tests at Stanford."
But Diamond said he is optimis
tic after hearing positive reports
about Herrington from a North
western University student leader.
Former Northwestern Student
President Eva Jefferson, tele
phoned in Chicago, told the Daily,
"I think Herrington's a fair man
and an honest man and one who's
willing to listen to you."
Jefferson, known for her Sep
tember television debate with
Spiro Agnew, said her occasional
clashes with Herrington came
from their differing political per
spectives. For instance, she said
she disagreed with his decision to
call in outside police for some
demonstrations to which she was
sympathetic.
And she said some students had
opposed Herrington's policy of
photographing protesters, al
though Herrington said his men
only recorded likely or actual
crimes.
Asked about his contacts with
students, Harrington said, "I've
had my ups and downs, but I
always got along with the people
in the community I've worked
for. And for the past 10 years,
students have been that com
munity."
Before his Northwestern stint,
Herrington worked his way up
from patrolman to chief of the
police department at the Univer
sity of California at Davis.

At Northwestern Herrington
took over an eight-man security
group and developed it into a
highly-trained 40-man police
department. Administrators evi
dently believe Herrington, whose
new job reportedly pays over
$20,000 a year, can develop
Stanford's weak security forces.
