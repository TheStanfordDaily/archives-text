# 'The Sorcerer'--Good Entertainment
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
In a world where too many
people are motivated far too often
by money alone, it is nice to see
people doing something for the
pure enjoyment of it. Among the
people who often do this are
non-professional entertainers who
work long and hard for returns
which are seldom greater than a
loud round of applause.
Such a group of talented and
enthusiastic people is the Lamp
lighters, a San Francisco based
group which specialized in oper
ettas. The high level of entertain
ment which a serious and talented
non-professional group can
acheive is ably demonstrated by
their current production of Gil

bert and Sullivan's "The Sorcer
er."
No Pushover
And Gilbert and Sullivan oper
ettas are not pushovers for any
company. Admittedly they are
usually "light" shows which do
not require the greatest amount of
dramatic intensity. But the singing
talent and other abilities need to
make them work are not small.
"The Sorcerer" is one in a long
line of popular operettas written
by Sir Arthur Sullivan and Sir
William Gilbert in the late 19th
century.
"The Sorcerer" deals with one
of the more frequent topics for
the In it, Alexis
Pointdextre, son of the elderly

baronet, Sir Marmaduke Point
dextre, marries Aline Sangazure.
They are deeply in love, and after
getting married, Alexis wants to
spread love throughout the village
by spiking the tea at a party with
a love philter which the sorcerer
sells.
Alexis wants Aline to take
some of the philter as a proof of
her love, but she feels this is
unnecessary. Of course, they have
a fight. The tea gets spiked,
everyone is knocked out for
awhile and when they wake up,
they fall in love with the first
person they see.
Many strange match-ups natur
ally occur. But the biggest prob
lem is that Aline finally decides to

take the philter, and accidentally
falls in love with another man.
Happy Ending
Finally the sorcerer is banished,
the spell wears off and everyone
lives happily ever after. It certain
ly is a story line far from being
one of the heaviest or most
relevant of all time. But within
the story are some good points
about love and devotion and other
human emotions and faults.
But mostly "The Sorcerer" is
just good entertainment. If every
theatrical production strived
mainly for a "heavy message," the
theater would soon become a

nightmare of monotony. Frankly,
it's mainly just funt to watch.
Strong Vocalists
Eugene Bartlett as the old
love-sick vicar and Gilbert Russak
as the sorcerer, John Wellington
Wells are both outstanding. Their
vocal abilities are quite strong.
Russak is extremely adept at
handling some of the difficult
fast-paced tongue-twisters which
Gilbert used often.
Kenneth Malucelli is appro
priate as Alexis and Anita Gus
tavsson though not the most
beautiful Aline, still works well
with Malucelli and the two come
off well as the deep-in-love
couple. They are both well-trained
singers who handled well most of
the solos required of them.
Annunciation is of course the
key to getting much of any
operetta and almost all the com
pany came through well here. A
few of the smaller performers'
words were lost, but almost all the
main people did well.
("The Sorcerer" will be pre
sented on Friday and Saturday
nights through August 7th at the
Presentation Theatre, 2350 Turk
Street in San Francisco. Tickets
are $3.50 for adults, $1.75 for
students and $1.00 for children) .
