# 'Bob And Ray'- Hilarious
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
If you haven't seen Bob and
Ray in their two-man Broadway
show, "Bob and Ray—The Two
and Only," and you don't have a
ticket for one of the four
remaining Stanford performances,
I suggest you read the rest of this
review as quickly as possible, and
then run—not walk—to the Tresid
der Box Office and put your
money down as fast as possible.
The night I saw it—Tuesday-
Memorial Auditorium was nearly
full. People are coming from all
over the Bay Area to see these
two quiet, unpretentious come
dians in their only West Coast
appearance. I suspect that the
.weekend shows will be sold out.
Why do people bother to drive
from San Francisco to Stanford to
sit in an overheated barn of a
theater with the worst acoustics in
North America, at prices to make
the affluent shudder?
They bother because Bob El
liott and Ray Goulding are very
very funny.
Quiet Satire
Although they have had almost
no exposure in this area, Bob and
Ray are familiar names—and
voices—throughout the East. Their
specialty is quiet, unobtrusive,
intelligent satire. Having started
out as radio announcers on
WHDH in Boston, their humor is
almost entirely verbal, straight
forward, fast, and capable of
slipping easily into a three-minute
time slot.
The show they are presenting at
Stanford ran for six months on
Broadway, and consists of twenty
or thirty (who counts) "spots."
Some originated as station breaks
on "Monitor"; others may have
originated as inserts between traf
fic reports.
Most are in interview format,
with Bob interviewing Ray, or
perhaps Ray interviewing Bob, or
in one case, Bob interviewing both

of them. All were either written
by Bob and Ray, or improvised
"live" on one of their radio
shows.
Skunk Haven
Because the humor is almost
entirely verbal, it is impossible to
reproduce it here with any kind of
accuracy. How can I describe the
subtleties of an "interview" with
Ralph Moody Thayer, the Mayor
of Skunk Haven, New Jersey, who
discusses the wonderful oppor
tunities available today in the
field of corruption?
Then there is Clinton Snidely,
who makes his living hunting for
truffles in Central Park; Wally
Ballou, the roving reporter who
never seems to be on top of the
fast-breaking story; and Hector
Lassie, who raises the curtain at
Memorial Auditorium.
Attic Set
According to the program,
"The setting is quite cluttered."
Well, yes it is. In fact, it is almost
as hard to describe as the humor.
If you can imagine the contents of
every attic in Palo Alto dumped
on the stage of Mem Aud, you
will have the essential ides. (If
you're going to have two radio
comedians doing radio routines
on stage, I guess an attic is as good
a setting as any.)
In addition to the confused pile
of junk (some of which, we are
told, was donated by Herb Caen
and by the Stanford Athletic
Department), there is also a
closed-circuit TV system that is
cleverly used to project the face
of either Bob or Ray onto a small
screen at the rear of the set, giving
the impression of "on-the-spot
television interviews."
The Bob and Ray show is,
simply, two gentlemen, who, for
two solid hours, are very funny.
The ticket price is high, but it's
worth every penny. You can't
lose.
Go!
