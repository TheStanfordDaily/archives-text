# Police Bill Blasted
## 
### 
A Stanford-initiated bill to give campus police more power would
sow "the seeds of a Fascist state," Assemblyman Willie Brown charged
in Sacramento Wednesday.
Brown said the bill would give campus administrators control of
police activities which in a democracy should only be under the
jurisdiction of elected officials.
"A Fascist state, a Fascist state," agreed Berkeley Assemblyman
John Miller according to UPI.
The bill, introduced at Stanford's request, would allow campus
security guards to make arrests and claim other full police powers
they now lack.
The Ways and Means Committee, which Brown heads, refused to
hear the bill and sent it back to the Criminal Justice Committee,
where it started.
Several Ways and Means members reportedly said they would
accept the bill if it came back with amendments suggested to them by
its- sponsor, Santa Cruz Assemblyman Frank Murphy. Murphy's
change would permit full police powers only for campuses with more
than 3,000 students. And it would shift proposed regulation of the
campus forces from the state attorney-general to the local sheriff.
A spokesman for the Santa Clara County Sheriff, the bill's most
active opponent, said his department would oppose the amended bill
in spite of the new regulatory role it gives the sheriff.
