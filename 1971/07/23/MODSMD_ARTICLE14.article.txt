NONCONFORMISTS AXED
Two nonconformists this week
lost battles to work in nearby
schools. The Palo Alto schools
rescinded approval of Harold
Supriano as a "multicultural
aide." The action came after local
residents received newspaper arti
cles—believed to be mailed by far
right-wingers—which described his
1964 arrest in a San Francisco
civil rights demonstration and his
1965 trip to Hanoi.
Supriano said he had not told
the Palo Alto School Board about
the activities earlier because "they
never asked." He called their
action, taken with no public
explanation, "going back to the
McCarthy era."
At Foothill College, English
instructor Harold Booton lost an
appeal to keep his job. Among
charges which brought his firing:
not holding classes during protests
following the Cambodian invasion
in May, 1970; not using the
required texts and course outlines;
giving an "A" to a student who
dropped a course in mid-semester;
and staging a "sex-oriented" play

which was unrelated to the
curriculum.
Attorney Norton Tooby told
trustees, "Foothill should be a
large enough place to accommo
date many different teaching
styles." Trustees unanimously
voted to uphold the firing after
discussing it in a closed session.
GOLF INVITATIONAL

teams will be competing today for

ifying round of the 39th annual

tion. Today's first foursome will

PACKARD RESIGNING?
( United Press International re
ported this week that Stanford
Trustee emeritus David Packard
may resign his post as Deputy
Secretary of Defense as a result of
his displeasure wil the Nixon
Administration's efforts to bail
out the Lockheed Aircraft Cor
poration.
Packard opposes the Admini
stration's $2 billion loan measure
to shore up Lockheed and other
faltering corporations, on the
ground that it would encourage
other Defense contractors to risk
cost overruns.
Recent testimony prepared by
him for delivery before the House
Banking Committee was edited
without Packer's knowledge and

cuts, refused to testify.

PACKARD RESIGNING?
( United Press International re
ported this week that Stanford
Trustee emeritus David Packard
may resign his post as Deputy
Secretary of Defense as a result of
his displeasure wil the Nixon
Administration's efforts to bail
out the Lockheed Aircraft Cor
poration.
Packard opposes the Admini
stration's $2 billion loan measure
to shore up Lockheed and other
faltering corporations, on the
ground that it would encourage
other Defense contractors to risk
cost overruns.
Recent testimony prepared by
him for delivery before the House
Banking Committee was edited
without Packer's knowledge and
consent. Packard, learning of the
cuts, refused to testify.
NONCONFORMISTS AXED
Two nonconformists this week
lost battles to work in nearby
schools. The Palo Alto schools
rescinded approval of Harold
Supriano as a "multicultural
aide." The action came after local
residents received newspaper arti
cles—believed to be mailed by far
right-wingers—which described his
1964 arrest in a San Francisco
civil rights demonstration and his
1965 trip to Hanoi.
Supriano said he had not told
the Palo Alto School Board about
the activities earlier because "they
never asked." He called their
action, taken with no public
explanation, "going back to the
McCarthy era."
At Foothill College, English
instructor Harold Booton lost an
appeal to keep his job. Among
charges which brought his firing:
not holding classes during protests
following the Cambodian invasion
in May, 1970; not using the
required texts and course outlines;
giving an "A" to a student who
dropped a course in mid-semester;
and staging a "sex-oriented" play
