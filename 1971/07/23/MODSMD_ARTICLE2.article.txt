# Brodie Resigns
## New Chairman To Hear Four Cases 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
H. Keith Brodie, associate prof,
of psychiatry, resigned his posi
tion as chairman of John Dolly's
grievance committee following the
apparent suicide of one of his
patients this week. Tuesday in a
letter of resignation to Acting
President William Miller Brodie
wrote, "I feel that the demands
this matter has made on my time
may seriously compromise my
ability to treat patients at Stan
ford."
Brodie's patient, a 39 year-old
woman from New York who was
being treated in a special drug
program for depressed patients,
fell or jumped out of a third floor
window Monday.

In an interview with the Daily,
Brodie denied that his resignation
was due to frustrations with the
hearing itself, except to say that it
was "an emotional drain," and
that "it was taking much more
time than I expected."
He also said, "although I feel
this hearing has been fair, I think
in this case it would be better to
have an arbitration unconnected
with the university rather than the
grievance procedure."
Miller, in accepting the resigna
tion, said a successor to Brodie
would be named as soon as
possible. Meanwhile three other
workers dismissed with Dolly for
their alleged participation in the
April 9 hospital sit-in have also
asked for grievance procedures.

Responding to the need for
four new chairmen for the hear
ings Robert Augsburger, vice pres
ident for business and finance,
suggested to Miller that "in the
interests of expediting the de
cision in these cases, and to strive
for uniformity of treatment, I
recommend that you consider the
appointment of a single individual
as chairman for all of these cases."
Augsberger said he made the
suggestion "to try to make all the
hearings, both in substance and
procedure, as consistent and uni
form as possible."
Miller accepted the recommen
dation and now is in the process
of trying to find a replacement
acceptable to the department
heads involved.
Criticism of the grievance pro
cedure has continued this week.
An informal investigation by the
ASSU found that the action very
possibly is illegal, and recom
mended that the administration
"display more tolerance toward
all its constituency, not just a
chosen few." „
Further, an open letter to
Miller signed by the ASSU and
others said "we urge that the
administration put John Dolly,
and the other four workers fired,
back on the job during their
grievance procedure."
In a related action an open
letter from library employees
claimed that "in a secret mail
ballot... an overwhelming major
ity of the library staff... ap
proved the new procedure"
(guidelines written by Librarian's
Association and Libraries Staff
Association which include "demo
cratic proceedings giving both
parties equal rights and requiring
equal responsibility on both
sides").

Responding to the need for
four new chairmen for the hear
ings Robert Augsburger, vice pres
ident for business and finance,
suggested to Miller that "in the
interests of expediting the de
cision in these cases, and to strive
for uniformity of treatment, I
recommend that you consider the
appointment of a single individual
as chairman for all of these cases."
Augsberger said he made the
suggestion "to try to make all the
hearings, both in substance and
procedure, as consistent and uni
form as possible."
Miller accepted the recommen
dation and now is in the process
of trying to find a replacement
acceptable to the department
heads involved.
Criticism of the grievance pro
cedure has continued this week.
An informal investigation by the
ASSU found that the action very
possibly is illegal, and recom
mended that the administration
"display more tolerance toward
all its constituency, not just a
chosen few." „
Further, an open letter to
Miller signed by the ASSU and
others said "we urge that the
administration put John Dolly,
and the other four workers fired,
back on the job during their
grievance procedure."
In a related action an open
letter from library employees
claimed that "in a secret mail
ballot... an overwhelming major
ity of the library staff... ap
proved the new procedure"
(guidelines written by Librarian's
Association and Libraries Staff
Association which include "demo
cratic proceedings giving both
parties equal rights and requiring
equal responsibility on both
sides").
H. Keith Brodie, associate prof,
of psychiatry, resigned his posi
tion as chairman of John Dolly's
grievance committee following the
apparent suicide of one of his
patients this week. Tuesday in a
letter of resignation to Acting
President William Miller Brodie
wrote, "I feel that the demands
this matter has made on my time
may seriously compromise my
ability to treat patients at Stan
ford."
Brodie's patient, a 39 year-old
woman from New York who was
being treated in a special drug
program for depressed patients,
fell or jumped out of a third floor
window Monday.

In an interview with the Daily,
Brodie denied that his resignation
was due to frustrations with the
hearing itself, except to say that it
was "an emotional drain," and
that "it was taking much more
time than I expected."
He also said, "although I feel
this hearing has been fair, I think
in this case it would be better to
have an arbitration unconnected
with the university rather than the
grievance procedure."
Miller, in accepting the resigna
tion, said a successor to Brodie
would be named as soon as
possible. Meanwhile three other
workers dismissed with Dolly for
their alleged participation in the
April 9 hospital sit-in have also
asked for grievance procedures.
