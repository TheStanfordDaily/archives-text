# Grad Meets Premier
## 
### LYNNE NERENBERG 
A Stanford graduate student,
his wife, and 13 other young
Americans are scheduled to leave
Communist China today after a
four week stay there which
included a meeting with Premier
Chou En-lai.
Kim Woodard, a doctoral can
didate in political science here,
and his wife are in the first group
of young American scholars, ail
members of the Committee of
Concerned Asian Scholars, to be
picked by the Chinese government
to visit the country in 22 years.
The Toronto Globe and Mail
reported that Premier's talk with
the scholars was aimed at clarify
ing Red China's interest in norm
alizing relations with the United
States. This would not be pursued
at the expense of the North
Vietnamese or Peking's other

Communist allies in Indochina.
The students reported some of
their other activities—including
attending a live performance of
the revolutionary ballet The Red
Detachment of Women, which
one student called "spectacular,"
and visiting what another student
called "a great achievement of
socialist organization," the Nan
king Yangtze River Bridge.
They visited a deaf-mute pri
mary school in Canton which
utilizes the controversial method
of acupuncture—the puncturing of
skin or tissue by a needle for relief
of pain, exit of fluid—to cure
patients.
Other activities included visits
to factories, industrial exhibitions,
hospitals, workers' housing,
schools, and communes; and dis
cussions with students, staff, and
teachers at Peking University.
