# This Week In The 'Daily'

Today is July 23, 1971. On this date, in the year 1936, Don
Drysdale u>as born in Van Nuys, California. Little Don ate his
Wheaties and grew up to be an ace pitcher for the Los Angeles
Dodgers, winner of the Cy Young Award in 1962, and friend
and colleague of such baseball greats as Sandy Koufax and
Tommy Davis.
If you know of any local boy making good, call our news

about it, call our business office at ext. 4630.
If you think of yourself as a Don Drysdale, and have eight
friends with the same delusion, the Stanford Daily Softball
Team is prepared to put you to the test. We challenge all
comers who meet our high standards of incompetence; who
allow girls, dogs, and Republicans on their team; and who
practice seldom, if ever.
