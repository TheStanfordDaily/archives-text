## A 						State Is Still A State 
### 
Karl Marx, as a young man, saw
the defeat of the revolutionary
struggles of 1848-49, but he kept
the ideals of those years: liberty,
fraternity, and the destruction of
privilege, whether of birth or of
wealth.
His theory of dialectical his
tory—an evolving technology and
the struggle of various groups to
control it—declares that the libera
tion of man, the inauguration of
truly "human" history, can occur
only when ownership of the
means of production (by anyone,
capitalist or state official) ceases
to exist.
But a look around you will
reveal that the world has not been
visibly approaching Marx's vision.
To be sure, laissez-faire capitalism
has disappeared, but this has
resulted from the discovery of
entrepreneurs and officials that
more is to be gained from
co-operation than from struggling
against one another.
Today we find national econo
mies becoming more and more
centralized without developing
any significant methods for public

control of resources and capital;
the individual entrepreneur has
been driven out by socialist
parties in the East and by
corporate businessmen in the
West, but accumulation is still the
name of the game.
All the Same
Both communism and welfare
state capitalism claim to offer
freedom and true democracy,
when in fact political and eco
nomic freedom are quite elusive in
both societies.
Unfortunately, the main thrust
of radicalism in this country has
been toward the solutions of fifty
years ago: democratic centralism
is having a renaissance.
The way to topple the tightly
organized state is proclaimed to
be the building of a still more
tightly-organized resistance, struc
tured to preserve discipline and
democracy at the same time; it is
assumed that the revolutionary
state will be structured in the
same manner.

Now for some thoughts on
democracy and freedom:
Rule by the people may mean
having elections or obtaining ma
jorities (although there are many
who would dispute this claim),
but majority rule definitely does
not imply a society of free
individuals. A free society is one
in which consensus is reached
among autonomous individuals
about what should be done in any
given situation.
It is much easier to make a
democracy function when the
group as a whole is threatened or
compelled by something or some
one, e.g., a nation at war, or a
revolutionary cadre under govern
ment pressure.
Not that individuals become
more equal or have their liberties
expanded under such circum
stances, but because of the single
goal they share they will toler
ate—freely accept—restrictions of
their liberties; consensus is easier
to obtain, for many more differ
ences of opinion are seen as trivial
in comparison to the bond that
unites the group. Once the crisis is
passed, however, factionalism be
comes a bigger and bigger prob
lem, and more and more decisions
must be enforced by constituted
authority rather than being
obeyed from choice by all those
affected; centralism and bureau
cracy grow up like fungus on the
still warm corpse of community.
Who's In Power?
Now, who is it that does this
decision-making and enforcing?
The answer is simple: people who,
by obtaining more votes or having
more physical or economic power,
decide that they have the right to
tell others what is desirable and
undesirable, moral and immoral,
permissible and obligatory and
forbidden.

Most people seem quite happy
under most circumstances to relin
quish their autonomy in return
for promises of good deeds from
those in power, and often in the
absence even of promises.
Common Good
There was a time when the
government was looked upon as
representative of the common
good, existing to curb the activi
ties of certain powerful individ
uals who sought to take advantage
of an unorganized public.
Whether this view was ever
correct does not concern me here;
but I assert that it is definitely not
correct now, when the powerful
individual interests have merged
with government to give us the
"national interest," that ravenous
catch-all claim to allegiance that
gobbles up individual rights so
that we can collectively be strong
(!) and free (?).
Alternatives
But what is the alternative the
Marxists offer? Marx himself was

concerned with the liberation of
man, the freeing of his potentials.
Lenin, however, was more inter
ested in running a state, which
means harnessing potentials.
Marxism has bom Lenin's stamp
for half a century, and it has
passed from an ideology of
dispersed technology and no gov
ernment to one of centrally
planned economies and strict
controls on society.
"Democratic centralism" still
means the preservation of the
state apparatus of coercion and
suppression; when there are peo
ple at the political center whose
word is law, then one needs to
think carefully about what is
meant by "democratic" in "demo
cratic centralism," and whether
this actually means freedom.
True Freedom
If democracy means the rule of
some people over others, even if
"some" means a majority, then
democracy does not mean free
dom, at least not freedom for all.
This fact was much more
widely recognized at the inception
of our republic; that is the reason
for the Bill of Rights. But
governments seem to have a
momentum of their own; the
result is that the Tenth Amend
ment has been virtually ignored.
Man stands in greater need of
liberation, now that laissez-faire
capitalism has given way to state
capitalism. And freedom requires
more than republican government
—or perhaps less than republican
government.
Marxism could help provide
answers or at least goals for our
time, but not traditional Marxist-
Leninism. A workers' state is still
a state, and states—by their
nature—can only limit freedom,
not create it.
