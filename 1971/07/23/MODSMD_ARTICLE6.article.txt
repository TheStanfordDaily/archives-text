Of late, a united front of rail,
water, and truck interests is
pushing a "reform package" in
Congress which is designed to
patch up any holes in existing
monopolistic arrangements in the
transportation industry.
This is another living embodi
ment of the thesis Gabriel Kolko
presented in his book The
Triumph of Conservatism, an
industry is using the governmental
apparatus to protect its market
and police a cartel arrangement.
In getting together on this new
transportation package, the rail,
water, and truck interests did a
little logrolling among themselves.
They have decided to trade off

among themselves different pos
sible patterns of government regu
lation in order to set up the best
over-all cartel.
The July 17 "Business Week"
detailed some of this industrial
statesmanship. "The truckers fear
cutthroat competition in their
industry and want to limit the
entry of new operators into
trucking. The rail and barge
industries can afford to support
the truckers on this. They can also
support the big regulated motor
carriers seeking more regulation of
those truckers who are now
exempt, such as those who carry
farm products.
"In exchange, the big truckers
would be willing to publish the

rates they charge ... At present,
railroads must post all rates, but
truckers do not have to post all
theirs." (Legally enforced public
posting of prices is a very effective
mechanism for policing a price
fixing agreement.)
As economists Armen Alchian
and William Allen observe in their
textbook Exchange and Produc
tion: "Where successful collusions
have been carefully investigated, it
has been found that special laws,
favors, tax exemptions, or govern
ment controls have enabled col
luding groups to 'police' recal
citrant members and keep out
new producers."

The May 1971 issue of

"Psychology Today" contains a
devastating attack on the Food
and Drug Administration by Dr.
Paul Blachly. His contention is
that the FDA has deprived the
American public of drugs of
"proven safety and effectiveness."
Dr. Blachly, who has degrees in
biology, neurophysiology, and
medicine, points out that one of
the FDA's own physicians has
testified before a Senate subcom
mittee that with today's regula
tions and requirements ordinary
aspirin "would never win the
FDA's stamp of approval."
An editorial in the July 22 New
York Times assesses the effect of
the farm subsidy program. "Of $4
billion spent last year in farm
subsidies, $1.5 billion—well over a
third—went to a mere 5 percent of
the farmers. Sixty-eight corpora
tions and individuals received
between $250,000 and $1 million
each, while seven corporations
obtained more than $1 million
apiece ... 'Agribusiness' has been
feeding at the public trough too
long."

A Washington Post story by
William Greider, published in the
June 20 San Jose Mercury-News,
merits lengthy quotation.
"The federal government main
tains a super-secret listing of

so-called potential subversives—a
file that would be the basis for
federal arrests in the event of war
or an 'internal security emer
gency.'
"It is called the 'Security
Index,' compiled and kept up-to
date by the FBI and supervised by
the Justice Department's internal
security division.
"Although the index has been
in existence since at least the
19305, the government does not
admit it, even when Congress
makes an inquiry. The FBI and
the Justice Department refuse to
concede even that there is some
thing called the Security In
dex .. .
"The index is a. .. list of
names, addresses, jobs, and phone
numbers of thousands of Ameri
cans considered potentially dan
gerous as spies or saboteurs, if war
or national insurrection develop
ed.
"How many thousands is not
known but the list has been
expanded in recent years as New
Left radicals and militant black
leaders were added to the rolls,
joining the Old Left types from
the Communist Party and Trot
skyite organizations. A conserva
tive guess based on public figures
on subversives is that 10,000 are
[on the list]."
