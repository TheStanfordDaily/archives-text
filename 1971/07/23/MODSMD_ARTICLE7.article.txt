Editor, The Daily:
Banning Garrett's analyses of
the situation in Southeast Asia
have been so brilliant in the past
(he predicted with incredible
accuracy the outcome of the Laos
invasion) that some of his state
ments in Tuesday's Daily came as
a shock.
The Chinese, he said, "are
winning in Vietnam." If anyone is
"winning" there it is not the
Chinese but the Vietnamese peo
ple, who have been fighting off
foreign invaders for 25 years with
only minimal help from the
Chinese and the Russians.
But they haven't won yet;
untold numbers of Indochinese
people are still dying under the
daily rain of U.S. bombs or
rotting their lives away behind
barbed wire. No one can say with
assurance exactly what kind of a
deal will emerge from the Nixoh
visit to China.
China's invitation to Nixon has
vviped off the front pages the fact
that the PRG and North Vietnam
recently made a major peace

proposal, guaranteeing release of
our prisoners and safety for U.S.
troops, to which the U.S. respond
ed only with embarrassed double
talk.
Nixon's new image as a peace
maker, which China has helped to
create, has erased the more
accurate one of a man who urged
U.S. military involvement in Viet
nam 20 years ago, who supported
every excalation of the war, who
spread the devastation to Laos
and Cambodia, and who not long
ago reaffirmed his determination
to achieve victory.
It is difficult to imagine that in
exchange for a smile and a
handshake from Chou, Nixon will
suddenly reverse himself on Viet
nam. The Vietnamese people,
North and South know better.
They have learned through agony
and bloodshed to trust no major
power and they may very well be
right.
I hope that those like Mr.
Garrett who have been so insight
ful about the Vietnamese struggle
will not let enchantment with
China make them victims of

Nixon's cleverest trick to date.
It is just possible that Nixon's
visit to China will prove advan
tageous both to Nixon and to
Chinaâ€”while Vietnam continues
to suffer under the burden of
American aggression.
