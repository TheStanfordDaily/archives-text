This Week In The 'Daily'
Today is July 27, 1971. In honor of the flight of Apollo 15,
today's Daily box will dispense with frivolity, and present an
important, if little known, piece of scientific datum.
To wit: The height of the Saturn rocket, minus the
command-service module and the launch escape tower, is 281.8
feet; the height of Hoover Tower is 285 feet. (How's that grab
you, space fans?) So, if you can imagine an Apollo capsule
perched on top of Hoo Tow, you'll get an idea of the sizes
involved in the Space Game.
The question that immediately arises is, how would life be
different if Hoo Tow were filled with hypergolic rocket fuel?
If you hear any loud rumbles, with both billows of smoke
and Hoo Tow emerging from the direction of the History
corner, call our news office at 321-2300, ext. 4632. If you'd
like to buy the moon, call our business office at ext. 4630.
If you'd like to trip out, call 202-962-4442, and see what
they've got available.
