# Sher Appointed In Staff Hearings
## 
### 
Law school Professor Byron Sher
was named yesterday by Provost Miller
to fill the seat on the John Dolly
grievance committee vacated early last
week by the resignation of Assoc. Prof,
of Psychiatry H. Keith Brodie. Sher,
who as administration appointee auto
matically becomes chairman of the
committee, will serve in the same
capacity in the upcoming grievance
hearings for several other workers fired
by University Personnel Director
Robert M. Nelson for alleged participa
tion in the April 9 hospital sit-in.
The idea of having a single adminis
tration appointee as chairman of all the
grievance boards was suggested to
Provost Miller by Vice President for
Business and Finance Robert Augsbur
ger, according to a memo from
Augsberger to Deans Wilson and Man
ning and Library Director David Weber.
In addition, Augsberger suggested that
the Deans and Weber agree on "[the
same] person as the appointee of each of
you to the grievance review committee
which will consider the case of the
employee from your school or depart
ment." The grievance procedure pro
vides for the appointment of one
member of the committee by the
administration, one by the department
chairman and one by the aggreived
worker, however, for Dolly's commit
tee, his Department chairman, Joshua
Lederberg chose the option of allowing
the Dean of the Medical School, John
Wilson, to name his member. It would
appear from Augsberg's letter that the
shift in responsibility for the "depart
mental" appointment from department
chairman to Dean is apparently being
made in all of the grievance cases.
With the appointment of Sher, the
Dolly grievance hearing could be
reopened immediately, however, at
tempts to get a single "departmental"
appointee for all the hearings may
prevent this from occurring. According
to KZSU, the Deans and Weber, who
must come to agreement on the
appointee, have reached no decision as
of yesterday. To further complicate
matters, as Augsberger points out in a
memo to Miller, Wilson has already
appointed different individuals for the
Dolly and Chatman cases. "This way,

of course, result in the need for one or
both of those chosen thus far by Wilson
to step down . .
Unaware of this latest development,
Roland Finston, Dolly's appointee to
the grievance committee, hailed Sher's
appointment, stating that "Now we can
get back to business. Dolly has been
without a job since early July. We have
a responsibility to get these hearings
finished. It doesn't cost the administra
tion anything to pile on the delays but
for a man with a family on the way it is
another question."
The delays Finston referred to were:
the administration decision to bar
Dolly's appointed grievance representa
tive, Bruce Franklin, after the first
public hearing because they felt that
Franklin's status as a suspended profes
sor does not qualify him as an
employee of Stanford; the resignation
of the administration appointee, H.
Keith Brodie, because of the enormous
amount of time the hearings and
behind-the-scenes meetings and arrange
ments were taking which detracted
from his medical practice; the reorgani
zation of administrative policy with
regards to a total approach to the five
fired workers and their grievance
procedures, and the refusal of the
administration to be responsible for
bringing witnesses to support their cast 1
before the committee.
Asked whether he might follow
Brodie's lead and resign as well, Finston
replied, "No. I'm still in and, as far as I
know, so is Harry Miller. It may be a
little dull for us to rehear Nelson's
testimony, which I think we will have
to as Sher will certainly want to hear
the charges against Dolly, but although
1 can't obviously speak for Miller, I
can't see why either of us should
further complicate things by resigning
now."
Harry Miller was unavailable for
comment.
