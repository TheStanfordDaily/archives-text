# New 'Committee' Show
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
San Francisco is a city of
change. The mayor changes, the
skyline changes, the fish served on
Fisherman's Wharf changes (some
times). But as eternal as the
morning tie-ups on the Bayshore
Freeway is The Committee Revue,
"the oldest on-going theatrical
institution in the Bay Area."
North Beach has gone from
Italian to Beat to Bottomless, but
The Committee lives on at 622
Broadway, just an eye's glance
from the silicone salons and
dirty-book stores.
The Committee is, along with
the Second City in Chicago, one
of the original improvisational
theaters. Specializing in social and
political satire, The Committee
develops its material by improvis
ing on themes suggested by the
audience. Improvisation sessions
are held after the week-night
shows, the weekend shows are
"rehearsed" and largely non
improvisational.
In a way, reviewing a new
Committee show is like reviewing
the Ringling Brothers Circus. You
know that what you are going to
see will be a variation on what
you saw last time, and that it will
be good. The question is, how
original is the new, material, and
just how good is it?
Above Average
I would say that this show is
slightly above The Committee's
two-year average. Recent Commit
tee shows have been looking up

after a rather discouraging slump
around 1968-69, and while this
production rarely sent me into
spasms of uncontrollable laughter,
it did keep me reasonably happy
for 90 minutes.
Some of the sketches are more
clever than funny, such as when
an impatient motorist is stopped
by "the politest traffic officer" on
the force for passing a stop sign,
and is driven to the point of
pleading for his ticket to escape
the policeman's maddeningly
good manners.
Others are funny without being
clever. "Beyond the Prince of
Denmark," shows how a skin-flick
director would stage a scene
between Hamlet and Ophelia.
(The key to the play is that
"Hamlet can't get it up"; how's
that for a Master's thesis?).
Pull Out
A few of the sketches are both
clever and funny. In "Nixon
Speaks," the President goes on
television to explain what his
daughter Julie was doing in an
apartment with "a certain Chinese
gentleman." She's a CIA agent, he
says. "This is not adultary"; she
will quietly withdraw before the
monsoon rains. "And,"he adds,
"so will the Chinese gentleman."
If this show represents a major
departure in any way from the
classic Committee format, it is in
the increased use of physical
comedy. Actors play non-existant
pianos, get dragged across the
stage, or get carted around like a

piece of lumber. It's not slapstick,
but then again, it's not the usual
Committee fare, except of course
that it's funnier than hell.
The Company includes Morgan
Upton, John Brent, Gary Austin,
Dan Barrows, Jim Cranna, Julie
Payne and Ruth Silviera, and
features the piano of Bill Mathieu
and Dr. Gosling Trauma.
Larry Hankin, an old (and
original) Committee member, di
rects this show.
Performances are nightly, ex
cept Monday, at 9:00 and 11:00
p.m., with three shows Saturday
at 8:30, 10:30 and 12:30 p.m. A
student body card gets you a
$1.00 discount. Although the man
agement peddles drinks with a
passion, minors are welcome,
which makes this one of the few
night-spots in the Broadway area
accessible to most undergraduates.
If you're looking for an enter
taining evening in the city, at a
reasonable price, The Committee
is the place to go. Reservations are
recommended.



SMILING FACES-No these are not members of The Committee doing the skit (described elsewhere on this page) about the overly-friendlv cop
who drives people crazy by being too nice. Actually this is one of the Santa Clara County Sheriff's Deputies who constitute a campus traffic
enforcement patrol. Apparently most citations have been given for speeding violations and running stop signs. Sometimes you just have to grin
and bear it.
