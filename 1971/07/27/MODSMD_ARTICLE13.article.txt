Two art exhibits are currently
being shown on campus which
have great historical signigicance.
They are the American Indian Art
Show, currently on display in the
Art Gallery, and the War, Revolu
tion and Peace poster exhibit,
being shown in Meidel Room of
•the Stanford Museum.
War, Revolution and Peace, a
brilliant compilation of propagan
da posters from the archives of

the Hoover Institution, was organ
ized by graduate Art History
students Paula Harper and Marcia
Cohn Crowden. Aside from their
artistic value, these 82 posters tell
a story of national sympathies,
struggles and sentiments during
World Wars I and 11.
The poster did not emerge as an
effective art medium on a mass
scale until the advent of World
War I, when individual govern
ments literally floded their na
tions with millions of propaganda
posters to muster public support
for total war.
Between 1914 and 1945, mil
lions of government-sponsored
posters were issued by the United
States, British, French and Ger
man governments and by the

Russian Bolshevik and German
Nazi parties. The exhibition has
posters arranged by nation rather
than by date, to emphasize the
differences in their inherent prop
aganda characteristics.
Different Styles
Sharp differences between
nationalistic images are very ap
parent. The German posters are
brutal and to the point.
The Russians show crude and
massive geometric style in illus
trating the "Supremacist" theme
of the Bolshevik Revolution. They
also employed cubism and futur
ism to define their self-image of a
dynamic Russia.
Later Russian posters exhibit
peasant and popular art styles, but
the posters from around the
thirties and after reflect the
"social realism" themes of might,
machines, men and heroism, and
the activism of Stalin's govern
ment.
The French seemed to prefer
romantically complex and turbu
lent themes, as if it were their
duty to portray the image of war
in aesthetic masterpieces. The
British were direct and forthright,
and the Americans, although
varied, were mainly gushingly
patriotic and responsible for the
most fashionably commercial
posters.
Charles Gibson, creator of the
"Gibson Girl," and Norman Rock
well were among the illustrators
who dwelled on the enthusiastic
patriotic themes. Their posters
were printed in editions of 10,000
to 1,000,000 which gives some
idea of the number of posters that
flooded the American scene and
which helped create the great
collective hate of the Germans.
With each country's art
propaganda, it is interesting to

compare the development of style
and self-image, as well as improve
ments in the photo-lithographic
techniques. The individual differ
ences are more apparent in the
early works of World War I when
national feelings ran highest.
Radio and television had supplant
ed much of the posters' weight by
the time of WWII.
The selection for the exhibit
was based on historic message and
merit rather than on artistic
ingenuity and style. The message
takes precedent over the medium.
The war posters on display were
aimed at establishing indelibly the
national government and its task
at hand. Whether romantic, crude,
brutal or patriotic in form and
content, the posters were selling
the same commodity—War.
Over in the Art Gallery, the
American Indian Art Show in
cludes an impressive collection of
pottery, basketry, leather and
silverwork. Like the poster show,
this collection is most appealing
for its historic perspective and
documentation, in addition to its
aesthetic value.
An outstanding pottery exhibit
includes early examples of gourd
pitchers from the Mesa Verde
dwelling place one of which dates
back to 1000 A.D. The basketry
includes some of the finest
examples of this oldest of Indian
crafts, including feather baskets of
exquisite detail and color which
were made by the Northern
Californian Pomo Indians.
Intricate Beadwork
By seeing the intricate details
of pottery, weaving and expecially
the beadwork of the Plains In
dians, one can gain great appre
ciation for the Indian heritage in
North America. Great ingenuity
was shown in making items of

personal use like the moccasins,
belts, stoles and jackets on dis
play, from thousands of strung
beads.
Beads were made from shells,
bones, claws, rocks and minerals.
Perhaps the most impressive high
light of the beadwork selections
are the two 19th century beaded
pipe bags, fringed with porcupine
quills, which were made by the
Sioux and the Cheyenne.
The Indian used simple mater
ials, integrating all that was near
to him with imagination and
ingenuity to produce a work of
art in nearly everything he made.
Recycling may seem new to us,
but to the Indian it was a fact of
life, which reflected his harmon
ious respect for the environment.
He spared none of the dead
buffalo, relying on this animal for

food, clothing, shelter and even
using parts of it for beadwork.
Silver Necklaces
The silverwork exhibit displays
ceremonial "naja" necklaces,
which were made by Indian men
after being introduced to silver by
the Spanish colonizers in the 16th
century. The bracelets and other
trinkets show how well they
mastered this craft.
In summary, the art, expecially
the pottery, basketry and bead
work, is an extremely fine
example of aesthetic simplicity
and purity of form. This show can
provide many lessons for today's
leather-worker, beader, weaver,
macrameist and potter.
War, Revolution and Peace will
be on display in the Meidel Room
of the Museum until August 15.
The museum is open from 10-5 on
Tuesday through Friday and from
1-5 on Saturday and Sunday.
The American Indian Art Show
will also be on display in the
Gallery until August 15. Hours for
the Gallery are 10-5 on Tuesday
through Saturday and 1-5 on
Sunday.

play, from thousands of strung
beads.
Beads were made from shells,
bones, claws, rocks and minerals.
Perhaps the most impressive high
light of the beadwork selections
are the two 19th century beaded
pipe bags, fringed with porcupine
quills, which were made by the
Sioux and the Cheyenne.
The Indian used simple mater
ials, integrating all that was near
to him with imagination and
ingenuity to produce a work of
art in nearly everything he made.
Recycling may seem new to us,
but to the Indian it was a fact of
life, which reflected his harmon
ious respect for the environment.
He spared none of the dead
buffalo, relying on this animal for

food, clothing, shelter and even
using parts of it for beadwork.
Silver Necklaces
The silverwork exhibit displays
ceremonial "naja" necklaces,
which were made by Indian men
after being introduced to silver by
the Spanish colonizers in the 16th
century. The bracelets and other
trinkets show how well they
mastered this craft.
In summary, the art, expecially
the pottery, basketry and bead
work, is an extremely fine
example of aesthetic simplicity
and purity of form. This show can
provide many lessons for today's
leather-worker, beader, weaver,
macrameist and potter.
War, Revolution and Peace will
be on display in the Meidel Room
of the Museum until August 15.
The museum is open from 10-5 on
Tuesday through Friday and from
1-5 on Saturday and Sunday.
The American Indian Art Show
will also be on display in the
Gallery until August 15. Hours for
the Gallery are 10-5 on Tuesday
through Saturday and 1-5 on
Sunday.

LEAVING THE FARM—Russian farm hands are seen heading to work
in factories in this 1931 photogravure which cost 50c. "All free hands
of the collective farms—to industry!"

series of two articles which will
explore the art exhibits currently
being shown on this campus. The
final article will appear in Friday's

Two art exhibits are currently
being shown on campus which
have great historical signigicance.
They are the American Indian Art
Show, currently on display in the
Art Gallery, and the War, Revolu
tion and Peace poster exhibit,
being shown in Meidel Room of
•the Stanford Museum.
War, Revolution and Peace, a
brilliant compilation of propagan
da posters from the archives of

the Hoover Institution, was organ
ized by graduate Art History
students Paula Harper and Marcia
Cohn Crowden. Aside from their
artistic value, these 82 posters tell
a story of national sympathies,
struggles and sentiments during
World Wars I and 11.
The poster did not emerge as an
effective art medium on a mass
scale until the advent of World
War I, when individual govern
ments literally floded their na
tions with millions of propaganda
posters to muster public support
for total war.
Between 1914 and 1945, mil
lions of government-sponsored
posters were issued by the United
States, British, French and Ger
man governments and by the

Russian Bolshevik and German
Nazi parties. The exhibition has
posters arranged by nation rather
than by date, to emphasize the
differences in their inherent prop
aganda characteristics.
Different Styles
Sharp differences between
nationalistic images are very ap
parent. The German posters are
brutal and to the point.
The Russians show crude and
massive geometric style in illus
trating the "Supremacist" theme
of the Bolshevik Revolution. They
also employed cubism and futur
ism to define their self-image of a
dynamic Russia.
Later Russian posters exhibit
peasant and popular art styles, but
the posters from around the
thirties and after reflect the
"social realism" themes of might,
machines, men and heroism, and
the activism of Stalin's govern
ment.
The French seemed to prefer
romantically complex and turbu
lent themes, as if it were their
duty to portray the image of war
in aesthetic masterpieces. The
British were direct and forthright,
and the Americans, although
varied, were mainly gushingly
patriotic and responsible for the
most fashionably commercial
posters.
Charles Gibson, creator of the
"Gibson Girl," and Norman Rock
well were among the illustrators
who dwelled on the enthusiastic
patriotic themes. Their posters
were printed in editions of 10,000
to 1,000,000 which gives some
idea of the number of posters that
flooded the American scene and
which helped create the great
collective hate of the Germans.
With each country's art
propaganda, it is interesting to

compare the development of style
and self-image, as well as improve
ments in the photo-lithographic
techniques. The individual differ
ences are more apparent in the
early works of World War I when
national feelings ran highest.
Radio and television had supplant
ed much of the posters' weight by
the time of WWII.
The selection for the exhibit
was based on historic message and
merit rather than on artistic
ingenuity and style. The message
takes precedent over the medium.
The war posters on display were
aimed at establishing indelibly the
national government and its task
at hand. Whether romantic, crude,
brutal or patriotic in form and
content, the posters were selling
the same commodity—War.
Over in the Art Gallery, the
American Indian Art Show in
cludes an impressive collection of
pottery, basketry, leather and
silverwork. Like the poster show,
this collection is most appealing
for its historic perspective and
documentation, in addition to its
aesthetic value.
An outstanding pottery exhibit
includes early examples of gourd
pitchers from the Mesa Verde
dwelling place one of which dates
back to 1000 A.D. The basketry
includes some of the finest
examples of this oldest of Indian
crafts, including feather baskets of
exquisite detail and color which
were made by the Northern
Californian Pomo Indians.
Intricate Beadwork
By seeing the intricate details
of pottery, weaving and expecially
the beadwork of the Plains In
dians, one can gain great appre
ciation for the Indian heritage in
North America. Great ingenuity
was shown in making items of

personal use like the moccasins,
belts, stoles and jackets on dis
play, from thousands of strung
beads.
Beads were made from shells,
bones, claws, rocks and minerals.

romantically complex and turbu
lent themes, as if it were their
duty to portray the image of war
in aesthetic masterpieces. The
British were direct and forthright,
and the Americans, although
varied, were mainly gushingly
patriotic and responsible for the
most fashionably commercial
posters.
Charles Gibson, creator of the
"Gibson Girl," and Norman Rock
well were among the illustrators
who dwelled on the enthusiastic
patriotic themes. Their posters
were printed in editions of 10,000
to 1,000,000 which gives some
idea of the number of posters that
flooded the American scene and
which helped create the great
collective hate of the Germans.
With each country's art
propaganda, it is interesting to

compare the development of style
and self-image, as well as improve
ments in the photo-lithographic
techniques. The individual differ
ences are more apparent in the
early works of World War I when
national feelings ran highest.
Radio and television had supplant
ed much of the posters' weight by
the time of WWII.
The selection for the exhibit
was based on historic message and
merit rather than on artistic
ingenuity and style. The message
takes precedent over the medium.
The war posters on display were
aimed at establishing indelibly the
national government and its task
at hand. Whether romantic, crude,
brutal or patriotic in form and
content, the posters were selling
the same commodity—War.
Over in the Art Gallery, the
American Indian Art Show in
cludes an impressive collection of
pottery, basketry, leather and
silverwork. Like the poster show,
this collection is most appealing
for its historic perspective and
documentation, in addition to its
aesthetic value.
An outstanding pottery exhibit
includes early examples of gourd
pitchers from the Mesa Verde
dwelling place one of which dates
back to 1000 A.D. The basketry
includes some of the finest
examples of this oldest of Indian
crafts, including feather baskets of
exquisite detail and color which
were made by the Northern
Californian Pomo Indians.
Intricate Beadwork
By seeing the intricate details
of pottery, weaving and expecially
the beadwork of the Plains In
dians, one can gain great appre
ciation for the Indian heritage in
North America. Great ingenuity
was shown in making items of

personal use like the moccasins,
belts, stoles and jackets on dis
play, from thousands of strung
beads.
Beads were made from shells,
bones, claws, rocks and minerals.
Perhaps the most impressive high
light of the beadwork selections
are the two 19th century beaded
pipe bags, fringed with porcupine
quills, which were made by the
Sioux and the Cheyenne.
The Indian used simple mater
ials, integrating all that was near
to him with imagination and
ingenuity to produce a work of
art in nearly everything he made.
Recycling may seem new to us,
but to the Indian it was a fact of
life, which reflected his harmon
ious respect for the environment.
He spared none of the dead
buffalo, relying on this animal for

food, clothing, shelter and even
using parts of it for beadwork.
Silver Necklaces
The silverwork exhibit displays
ceremonial "naja" necklaces,
which were made by Indian men
after being introduced to silver by
the Spanish colonizers in the 16th
century. The bracelets and other
trinkets show how well they
mastered this craft.
In summary, the art, expecially
the pottery, basketry and bead
work, is an extremely fine
example of aesthetic simplicity
and purity of form. This show can
provide many lessons for today's
leather-worker, beader, weaver,
macrameist and potter.
War, Revolution and Peace will
be on display in the Meidel Room
of the Museum until August 15.
The museum is open from 10-5 on
Tuesday through Friday and from
1-5 on Saturday and Sunday.
The American Indian Art Show
will also be on display in the
Gallery until August 15. Hours for
the Gallery are 10-5 on Tuesday
through Saturday and 1-5 on
Sunday.

LEAVING THE FARM—Russian farm hands are seen heading to work
in factories in this 1931 photogravure which cost 50c. "All free hands
of the collective farms—to industry!"

series of two articles which will

Two art exhibits are currently
being shown on campus which
have great historical signigicance.
They are the American Indian Art
Show, currently on display in the
Art Gallery, and the War, Revolu
tion and Peace poster exhibit,
being shown in Meidel Room of
•the Stanford Museum.
War, Revolution and Peace, a
brilliant compilation of propagan
da posters from the archives of

the Hoover Institution, was organ
ized by graduate Art History
students Paula Harper and Marcia
Cohn Crowden. Aside from their
artistic value, these 82 posters tell
a story of national sympathies,
struggles and sentiments during
World Wars I and 11.
The poster did not emerge as an
effective art medium on a mass
scale until the advent of World
War I, when individual govern
ments literally floded their na
tions with millions of propaganda
posters to muster public support
for total war.
Between 1914 and 1945, mil
lions of government-sponsored
posters were issued by the United
States, British, French and Ger
man governments and by the

Russian Bolshevik and German
Nazi parties. The exhibition has
posters arranged by nation rather
than by date, to emphasize the
differences in their inherent prop
aganda characteristics.
Different Styles
Sharp differences between
nationalistic images are very ap
parent. The German posters are
brutal and to the point.
The Russians show crude and
massive geometric style in illus
trating the "Supremacist" theme
of the Bolshevik Revolution. They
also employed cubism and futur
ism to define their self-image of a
dynamic Russia.
Later Russian posters exhibit
peasant and popular art styles, but
the posters from around the
thirties and after reflect the
"social realism" themes of might,
machines, men and heroism, and
the activism of Stalin's govern
ment.
