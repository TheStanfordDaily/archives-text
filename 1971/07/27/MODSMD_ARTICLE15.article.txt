# Impressive Lenox Quartet Continues Concert Series
## 
### DIANE McKENNEY 
Lovers of the Beethoven string
quartets will not want to miss the
continuing series of concerts being
given" by the Lenox Quartet at the
California Palace of the Legion of
Hoiior. The quartet is currently in
residence at the State University
of flew York at Binghamton. This
sumfrier they are giving a seminar
in string quartet playing at The
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music.
Concurrently, the quartet is
presenting a series of all-Beetho
ven'string quartet concerts. The
series began July 8 and continues
each Thursday evening through
August 12. The quartet has
chosen to play the Beethoven
quartets chronologically, begin
ning with the Opus 18 quartets
and«ending the series with the late
quaitets— Opus 133 and 135.
Last Thursday, the quartet
performed the Opus 59 quartets,
bettfir known as the Rasoumovsky
Quartets. The three quartets were
written during the year of 1806
and are considered to exemplify
the mature style. It
was* a challenging program to
perform.
Rough Start
The Quartet in F major no. 1
had a rough beginning. The
entrances were not quite together
and»the entire first movement
seenied forced. However, as the
progressed, the players
seemed to warm to the audience
and the music became much more
alive and spontaneous. The lovely
adagio movement was played with
great depth and sensitivity.
The second of the three quar

tets, in E minor, was performed
with a fine balance between its
outbursts of utter rage and mo
ments of charm. The first move
ment was especially engaging with
its exciting harmonic twists skill
fully played. Only in the Allegret
to movement did I sense some
heaviness in the otherwise fine
playing.
The fourth movement with its
galloping theme (Theme russe)
was played with tremendous
spirit. But along with its fast pace
one could not help but note the
tasteful rubato.
The third quartet in C major
seemed to captivate both the
audience and the performers for
an outstanding finish to the
evening. The music itself is per
haps the least complicated
thematically and harmonically of

the three, but it demands a great
deal of the performers.
Good Rapport
The definite rapport of the
Lenox quartet was able to bring
off the most difficult of passages
with ease. The second movement
merits special mention of the
cellist whose delicate part came
off with delightful abandon. The
fourth movement is a vigorous
fugue. It requires perpetual mo
tion, great intensity and involve
ment. The performers well met
the necessary demands.
Their playing generates great
excitement. True professionals,
they perform with deadly serious
ness. But musicians as well, they
perform Beethoven with musical
taste and thoughtfulness.
The performances begin at the
palace at 8:30 each Thursday. The
cost is $2.00.

Lovers of the Beethoven string
quartets will not want to miss the
continuing series of concerts being
given" by the Lenox Quartet at the
California Palace of the Legion of
Hoiior. The quartet is currently in
residence at the State University
of flew York at Binghamton. This
sumfrier they are giving a seminar
in string quartet playing at The
San Francisco Conservatory of
Music.
Concurrently, the quartet is
presenting a series of all-Beetho
ven'string quartet concerts. The
series began July 8 and continues
each Thursday evening through
August 12. The quartet has
chosen to play the Beethoven
quartets chronologically, begin
ning with the Opus 18 quartets
and«ending the series with the late
quaitets— Opus 133 and 135.
Last Thursday, the quartet
performed the Opus 59 quartets,
bettfir known as the Rasoumovsky
Quartets. The three quartets were
written during the year of 1806
and are considered to exemplify
the mature style. It
was* a challenging program to
perform.
Rough Start
The Quartet in F major no. 1
had a rough beginning. The
entrances were not quite together
and»the entire first movement
seenied forced. However, as the
progressed, the players
seemed to warm to the audience
and the music became much more
alive and spontaneous. The lovely
adagio movement was played with
great depth and sensitivity.
The second of the three quar

tets, in E minor, was performed
with a fine balance between its
outbursts of utter rage and mo
ments of charm. The first move
ment was especially engaging with
its exciting harmonic twists skill
fully played. Only in the Allegret
to movement did I sense some
heaviness in the otherwise fine
playing.
The fourth movement with its
galloping theme (Theme russe)
was played with tremendous
spirit. But along with its fast pace
one could not help but note the
tasteful rubato.
The third quartet in C major
seemed to captivate both the
audience and the performers for
an outstanding finish to the
evening. The music itself is per
haps the least complicated
thematically and harmonically of

the three, but it demands a great
deal of the performers.
Good Rapport
The definite rapport of the
Lenox quartet was able to bring
off the most difficult of passages
with ease. The second movement
merits special mention of the
cellist whose delicate part came
off with delightful abandon. The
fourth movement is a vigorous
fugue. It requires perpetual mo
tion, great intensity and involve
ment. The performers well met
the necessary demands.
Their playing generates great
excitement. True professionals,
they perform with deadly serious
ness. But musicians as well, they
perform Beethoven with musical
taste and thoughtfulness.
The performances begin at the
palace at 8:30 each Thursday. The
cost is $2.00.
