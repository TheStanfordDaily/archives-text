# Project Info Moves Ahead
## 
### JOHN FREDERICKS RICHARD KOKEN 
Commentary
Project INFO, Stanford's plan to create a university-wide
computer system and data bank, moved closer to
completion this month with the installation of a new
computer in the Administrative Computing Facility (ACF)
in Encina Hall.
The University was the nation's first customer to install
the new IBM model 370/145 computer, which replaces the
model 360 previously used at the Facility. The new 370 is
the same type of computer which was recently installed
amidst great secrecy at the White House.
The computer will be used entirely for administrative
data processing: preparation of the university payroll,
recording grades, tracking alumni gifts, and other services.
In addition, this computer will serve as the heart of a
system providing direct access to a central data file from
remote terminals in major administrative offices scattered
around the campus. Developed as part of Project INFO (the
Information Network for Operations), this will allow the
Registrar's Office, the Controller, the Alumni Office, and
other administrators to rapidly obtain such information as
student records, personnel files, and alumni contributions.
Ford Funding
Project INFO is a research effort run by the
Administrative Computing Group (ACG) which includes
the Administrative Computing Facility. The project is
partially funded by the Ford Foundation, whioh described
the grant as supporting "the development and testing of
new management techniques in the solution of problems of
higher education." Of the $1.1 million spent in the last
three years on the project, the Ford Foundation provided
$700,000 and Stanford funded the remainder.
In the next two years, almost $700,000 more has been
budgeted for Project INFO. It is expected that the Ford
Foundation will renew its grant, providing about $200,000,
and the remaining one-half million dollars would be
provided by Stanford.
Currently, the Administrative Computing Group receives
approximately $1 million annually from University general
funds. This includes the "income" generated by re-billing
procedures in which other departments within the
university receive money to pay the ACG for services
rendered.
Save Money?
Various individuals within the University have expressed
concern about such large expenditures for administrative
computing services—especially during the current period of
substantial cuts in other areas by the Budget Adjustment
Program. While it is difficult to make exact calculations,
representatives of the ACG insist that the project in the
long run will save money for the university. But other
sources, who have been involved in budget deliberations,
suggest that direct costs will increase, and other indirect
expenses and amortization should be included in
determining the net increase.

Project INFO has led to the development of an Online
Administrative Information System (OASIS) which, begin
ning this fall, will provide direct interaction between
remote terminals and the new computer. This information
retrieval system is intended to aid management decision
making, while also improving the day-to-day record keeping
operations within the University.
Although the data bank service will initially be provided
to the General Secretary's Office for fund-raising activities,
and to the Registrar, other records are to be integrated into
SAHlB—the Stanford Administrative Hierarchical Informa
tion Bank.
Better Ways Than This
Roger Salmon is a graduate student in the School of
Business who sat on the Trustee Finance Committee which
examined the proposed budget of the ACG and Project
INFO. He has suggested that the system does not deserve
the money which the University has poured into it. He
points out that there were other ways to boost efficiency
of University operating procedures which would not have
included a custom-designed operating system or remote
terminals, and the current plan "cannot justify itself as an
operational system."
Salmon also questioned whether significant improve
ments will occur in University decision making once the
system is implemented. It is difficult, however, to gauge
whether administrators will make "better" or "cheaper"
decisions with the help of the computer.
From elsewhere in the University, concern has been
expressed about maintaining compatibility between the
Administrative Computing Facility and the main Computa
tion Center, should it become desirable to integrate the two
at some time in the future. One professor in Computer
Science has noted that while the basic equipment is
compatible, the ACF has chosen to use an operating
system, programs, and other "software" which does not
lend itself to future consolidation.
Fireproof and Bulletproof
Following the lead of the Computation Center, the
computer in Encina will be protected by new security
measures. Recent additions have included sonic alarms,
tape storage vaults, interlocking entry doors, and windows
which are said to be fireproof and bulletproof.
To protect the information which is stored in the
computer, John Gwynn, Assistant Director of Project
INFO, said that the same security measures which presently
prevent unauthorized access to computerized files will also
safeguard the new terminal use. But a report prepared last
year by a SWOPSI course studying privacy of information
within the University warned that, "If a student building
occupation were to include ACF, as one did in 1969, the
director estimated that the technical restrictions on gaining
access to the system could be overcome in about one day."
In any case, Gwynn insisted that Project INFO will not
involve accumulation of new kinds of administrative
information, but will mean consolidation and reorganiza
tion of available information.

computer system and data bank, moved closer to
completion this month with the installation of a new
computer in the Administrative Computing Facility (ACF)
in Encina Hall.
The University was the nation's first customer to install
the new IBM model 370/145 computer, which replaces the
model 360 previously used at the Facility. The new 370 is
the same type of computer which was recently installed
amidst great secrecy at the White House.
The computer will be used entirely for administrative
data processing: preparation of the university payroll,
recording grades, tracking alumni gifts, and other services.
In addition, this computer will serve as the heart of a
system providing direct access to a central data file from
remote terminals in major administrative offices scattered
around the campus. Developed as part of Project INFO (the
Information Network for Operations), this will allow the
Registrar's Office, the Controller, the Alumni Office, and
other administrators to rapidly obtain such information as
student records, personnel files, and alumni contributions.
Ford Funding
Project INFO is a research effort run by the
Administrative Computing Group (ACG) which includes
the Administrative Computing Facility. The project is
partially funded by the Ford Foundation, whioh described
the grant as supporting "the development and testing of
new management techniques in the solution of problems of
higher education." Of the $1.1 million spent in the last
three years on the project, the Ford Foundation provided
$700,000 and Stanford funded the remainder.
In the next two years, almost $700,000 more has been
budgeted for Project INFO. It is expected that the Ford
Foundation will renew its grant, providing about $200,000,
and the remaining one-half million dollars would be
provided by Stanford.
Currently, the Administrative Computing Group receives
approximately $1 million annually from University general
funds. This includes the "income" generated by re-billing
procedures in which other departments within the
university receive money to pay the ACG for services
rendered.
Save Money?
Various individuals within the University have expressed
concern about such large expenditures for administrative
computing services—especially during the current period of
substantial cuts in other areas by the Budget Adjustment
Program. While it is difficult to make exact calculations,
representatives of the ACG insist that the project in the
long run will save money for the university. But other
sources, who have been involved in budget deliberations,
suggest that direct costs will increase, and other indirect
expenses and amortization should be included in
determining the net increase.

Project INFO has led to the development of an Online
Administrative Information System (OASIS) which, begin
ning this fall, will provide direct interaction between
remote terminals and the new computer. This information
retrieval system is intended to aid management decision
making, while also improving the day-to-day record keeping
operations within the University.
Although the data bank service will initially be provided
to the General Secretary's Office for fund-raising activities,
and to the Registrar, other records are to be integrated into
SAHlB—the Stanford Administrative Hierarchical Informa
tion Bank.
Better Ways Than This
Roger Salmon is a graduate student in the School of
Business who sat on the Trustee Finance Committee which
examined the proposed budget of the ACG and Project
INFO. He has suggested that the system does not deserve
the money which the University has poured into it. He
points out that there were other ways to boost efficiency
of University operating procedures which would not have
included a custom-designed operating system or remote
terminals, and the current plan "cannot justify itself as an
operational system."
Salmon also questioned whether significant improve
ments will occur in University decision making once the
system is implemented. It is difficult, however, to gauge
whether administrators will make "better" or "cheaper"
decisions with the help of the computer.
From elsewhere in the University, concern has been
expressed about maintaining compatibility between the
Administrative Computing Facility and the main Computa
tion Center, should it become desirable to integrate the two
at some time in the future. One professor in Computer
Science has noted that while the basic equipment is
compatible, the ACF has chosen to use an operating
system, programs, and other "software" which does not
lend itself to future consolidation.
Fireproof and Bulletproof
Following the lead of the Computation Center, the
computer in Encina will be protected by new security
measures. Recent additions have included sonic alarms,
tape storage vaults, interlocking entry doors, and windows
which are said to be fireproof and bulletproof.
To protect the information which is stored in the
computer, John Gwynn, Assistant Director of Project
INFO, said that the same security measures which presently
prevent unauthorized access to computerized files will also
safeguard the new terminal use. But a report prepared last
year by a SWOPSI course studying privacy of information
within the University warned that, "If a student building
occupation were to include ACF, as one did in 1969, the
director estimated that the technical restrictions on gaining
access to the system could be overcome in about one day."
In any case, Gwynn insisted that Project INFO will not
involve accumulation of new kinds of administrative
information, but will mean consolidation and reorganiza
tion of available information.

computer in the Administrative Computing Facility (ACF)
in Encina Hall.
The University was the nation's first customer to install
the new IBM model 370/145 computer, which replaces the
model 360 previously used at the Facility. The new 370 is
the same type of computer which was recently installed
amidst great secrecy at the White House.
The computer will be used entirely for administrative
data processing: preparation of the university payroll,
recording grades, tracking alumni gifts, and other services.
In addition, this computer will serve as the heart of a
system providing direct access to a central data file from
remote terminals in major administrative offices scattered
around the campus. Developed as part of Project INFO (the
Information Network for Operations), this will allow the
Registrar's Office, the Controller, the Alumni Office, and
other administrators to rapidly obtain such information as
student records, personnel files, and alumni contributions.
Ford Funding
Project INFO is a research effort run by the
Administrative Computing Group (ACG) which includes
the Administrative Computing Facility. The project is
partially funded by the Ford Foundation, whioh described
the grant as supporting "the development and testing of
new management techniques in the solution of problems of
higher education." Of the $1.1 million spent in the last
three years on the project, the Ford Foundation provided
$700,000 and Stanford funded the remainder.
In the next two years, almost $700,000 more has been
budgeted for Project INFO. It is expected that the Ford
Foundation will renew its grant, providing about $200,000,
and the remaining one-half million dollars would be
provided by Stanford.
Currently, the Administrative Computing Group receives
approximately $1 million annually from University general
funds. This includes the "income" generated by re-billing
procedures in which other departments within the
university receive money to pay the ACG for services
rendered.
Save Money?
Various individuals within the University have expressed
concern about such large expenditures for administrative
computing services—especially during the current period of
substantial cuts in other areas by the Budget Adjustment
Program. While it is difficult to make exact calculations,
representatives of the ACG insist that the project in the
long run will save money for the university. But other
sources, who have been involved in budget deliberations,
suggest that direct costs will increase, and other indirect
expenses and amortization should be included in
determining the net increase.

Project INFO has led to the development of an Online
Administrative Information System (OASIS) which, begin
ning this fall, will provide direct interaction between
remote terminals and the new computer. This information
retrieval system is intended to aid management decision
making, while also improving the day-to-day record keeping
operations within the University.
Although the data bank service will initially be provided
to the General Secretary's Office for fund-raising activities,
and to the Registrar, other records are to be integrated into
SAHlB—the Stanford Administrative Hierarchical Informa
tion Bank.
Better Ways Than This
Roger Salmon is a graduate student in the School of
Business who sat on the Trustee Finance Committee which
examined the proposed budget of the ACG and Project
INFO. He has suggested that the system does not deserve
the money which the University has poured into it. He
points out that there were other ways to boost efficiency
of University operating procedures which would not have
included a custom-designed operating system or remote
terminals, and the current plan "cannot justify itself as an
operational system."
Salmon also questioned whether significant improve
ments will occur in University decision making once the
system is implemented. It is difficult, however, to gauge
whether administrators will make "better" or "cheaper"
decisions with the help of the computer.
From elsewhere in the University, concern has been
expressed about maintaining compatibility between the
Administrative Computing Facility and the main Computa
tion Center, should it become desirable to integrate the two
at some time in the future. One professor in Computer
Science has noted that while the basic equipment is
compatible, the ACF has chosen to use an operating
system, programs, and other "software" which does not
lend itself to future consolidation.
Fireproof and Bulletproof
Following the lead of the Computation Center, the
computer in Encina will be protected by new security
measures. Recent additions have included sonic alarms,
tape storage vaults, interlocking entry doors, and windows
which are said to be fireproof and bulletproof.
To protect the information which is stored in the
computer, John Gwynn, Assistant Director of Project
INFO, said that the same security measures which presently
prevent unauthorized access to computerized files will also
safeguard the new terminal use. But a report prepared last
year by a SWOPSI course studying privacy of information
within the University warned that, "If a student building
occupation were to include ACF, as one did in 1969, the
director estimated that the technical restrictions on gaining
access to the system could be overcome in about one day."
In any case, Gwynn insisted that Project INFO will not
involve accumulation of new kinds of administrative
information, but will mean consolidation and reorganiza
tion of available information.

WATCH THE BLINKING LIGHTS-This is a computer. It's not the kind of
computer that will be installed in the new Administrative Computer Facility, but
it is similar to the one being replaced. The new model, an IBM 3 70/145, will be
faster and have more lights.
