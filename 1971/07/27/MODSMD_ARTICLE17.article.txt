VICTOR LOUIS VISITS
Victor Louis, a Soviet journalist
noted for undertaking delicate foreign
assignments for his country, will visit
Palo Alto on a 30-day visa granted by
the U.S. State Department. It is not
known exactly when Louis will be in
the area, or where he wiii visit. The
Soviet Consulate in San Francisco did
not disclose details of the visit, and
Stanford officials say they have no
information about the visit. While
foreigners sometimes meet with
scholars at Hoover Institute, an obser
ver points out that Louis may just be in
the area for a social visit.
TRESIDDER ROBBER
A young man broke into the second
floor ticket office of Tresidder Union
last Sunday evening. Witnesses called
the police as the man fled, taking
nothing.
Sheriff's deputies and Stanford
police units searched the area, but
made no arrests.
LAW REVIEW RECOMMENDS
Creation of a state public defender's
office and a crackdown on dilatory trial
judges, clerks, court reports, and
attorneys would help clear the state's

massive logjam of criminal appeals,
Justice Winslow Christian of the State
Court of Appeals in San Francisco
wrote in a recent issue of the "Stanford
Law Review."
The justice, who earned his under
graduate and law degrees at Stanford,
reported on the results of a 1970
survey made by his court.
HOUSING DEBATED
An informational public hearing on
proposed low and moderate income
housing on the Stanford campus drew

some 250 persons last Thursday night.
Planners for the development at Page
Mill and Peter Coutts Road said the
quality of the proposed housing would
be "comparable to Escondido Village,"
and that half of the open space in the
area would be preserved and enhanced.
Opponents of the project are worried
about overcrowding and say the "den
sity of children per acre" would be the
highest of any comparable project in
the areaâ€”"three times higher than in
Escondido Village," according to Prof.
David G. Luenkenger.
