# Parks For Foothills
## Open Space Proposal Faces Test 
### MADELINE NELSON 
A park district plan to save land in the foothills as open
space faces a major test this afternoon. The San Mateo
County Board of Supervisors is holding a public hearing at
2:30 p.m. on the proposal to create a Mid-Peninsula
Regional Park District.
The proposed district would levy a tax to buy or lease
land between the Bay and Skyline Blvd. from Woodside to
Los Gatos. The purchased land could later be developed as
parks but would be protected from further commercial or
residential development.
Although supported by nine of the 11 cities in the
district and by local conservations groups, the proposal has
opponents within the county governments involved.
San Mateo County's Parks and Recreation Commission,
the strongest source of opposition, views the district as "a
real threat to our Park and Open Space System," according
to John Brook, assistant director of the parks and
recreation department. Brook said taxes to support an
independent regional district would compete with the
county's plan for a bond issue to support open spaces. He
said voters would not support both plans.
San Mateo's Open Space System, added to the county's
Master Plan in 1969, calls for the acquisition of $167
million of land through bond issues. The district tax plan,

on the other hand, would provide only $1.5 million a year.
The Regional Planning Committee, which oversees the
Open Space Plan, concedes that the district might hurt the
chances of a bond issue but they feel the district should be
judged on its own merits. And backers of the district doubt
that any bond will be passed even without the district. The
Supreme Court recently upheld the two thirds majority for
bond elections and this will make passage of bonds
extremely difficult.
Proponents feel that the Parks and Recreation
Department is using the bond question as an excuse to
oppose a proposal which they see as an infringement on
their authority.
The committee that proposed the district states that an
independent agency with a guaranteed income that can not
be diverted is essential because "the counties cannot assign
the priorities and money necessary to save open space" due
to "the unrelenting pressures to spend money on welfare,
mental health, police protection, and other crises sectors."
The proponents are hopeful that public opinion will
prevail over the opposition in the county governments. In a
poll of 4,600 voters by park district supporters, 74% were
in favor of a tax to preserve open space.
If passed, Santa Clara County will also have to approve
the district before an election can be called. But a negative
decision by San Mateo today could kill the plan.
