# Fire Hits FCM, Damages Slight
## 
### 
The building which during the
regular academic year serves as the
headquarters of the Free Campus
Movement (FCM), a conservative politi
cal group, was slightly damaged by an
arson fire early Saturday morning as a
student tenant unconnected with the
group slept upstairs.
Paul Andrade, a deputy Santa Clara
County fire marshal! called to the
scene, said the fire was set by pouring
paint thinner on the east wall of the
house, located at 547 Lane B, near the
Post Office.
The fire was first reported by
Stanford Police Sgt. Charles Rayer.
After awakening the student, Mark
Venezia, the two managed to control
the fire with a chemical extinguisher
until the Fire Department arrived.
Venezia, a member of the anarchist
Radical Libertarian Alliance, was on
the radical slate of candidates for the
ASSU Senate last fall.
The arson was the third attempt in
slightly more than a year to burn down
the Free Market, as the FCM house is
known. One earlier attempt came on
the night of April 23, 1970, during an
evening sit-in at the Old Union when
three Molotov cocktails were thrown at
the Free Market; the other occurred in
February of this year. The building has
also been the frequent target of
rock-throwers, and, on at least one
occasion this year, has been shot at. No
one has ever been arrested in connec
tion with any of these incidents.
$100 Damage
Damage to the building was estimat
ed at about $100 by Elbridge Bacon
Jr., director of the University's physical
plant. Safety and alarm devices are now
being installed to safeguard the building
and its occupants in the future.
The FCM was formed in late 1969
when its members split from the Young
Americans for Freedom. There have
been numerous fights between FCM
members and campus revolutionaries,

many of them revolving around the
FCIVTs attempts to photograph demon
strations and nighttime acts of vandal
ism.
Several familiar campus political
figures yesterday speculated that the
latest attack on the Free Market may
have been in part caused by an
unsigned leaflet circulated late last
week detailing in an unfavorable light
the histories of the five workers fired
for their alleged participation in the
April 8-9 Hospital sit-in.
No Credit Taken
No one contacted by the Daily
would take credit for the leaflet, which
appears to be a compendium of
information obtained from various Bay
Area newspapers and magazines and
some personal observation. Raymond
White, chairman of the Free Campus
Movement, told the Daily that he was
not responsible for the leaflet, although
he expressed sympathy for the person
or persons who prepared it.
Among other points, the leaflet
charges that Devera E. Statisky, former
ly employed by the Law School, "in
the last few months . .. visited Orange
County to purchase 17 rifles and four
pistols with 3000 rounds of ammuni
tion, doubtless for use at peaceful
sit-ins." That information apparently
comes from an article that appeared in
the San Francisco Examiner written by
Ed Montgomery, a reporter with close
ties to many police agencies.
In San Jose yesterday, Undersheriff
Tom Rosa said that the Sheriff's Office
was working "extra hard" in an
attempt to solve the various bombings,
arsons and shootings that have plagued
the campus for the past two years.
On Street Crime Down
Rosa said that his department has
been able to cut "on-street" crime
(muggings, auto theft, rapes, etc.) by
50 percent in the three month period
since the Sheriffs have assumed control

FREE MARKET—The headquarters of the Free Campus Movement suffered
about $100 damage from an arson attack last Saturday. Added security measures
will be taken to protect the structure from further attacks.
of campus law enforcement, but has
been unable to apprehend anyone for
the "political" crimes.
He said that some of the bombs used
here recently were "fairly sophis
ticated," involving the use of plastique
and timing devices. But he said "an
eight-year-old" could have set the fire
at the Free Market.
Rosa said the Sheriffs do not utilize
undercover agents for "political work"
and that the department obtains most
of the information it needs from local

newspapers and "people" on campus.
"Most people will tell you what is
going on if you just ask them," he said.
He was surprised to find that one of
the departments cars—complete with at
least three shotguns in the trunk—was
operating with a Stanford staff sticker
(license 36988 C, sticker number 6383)
but said it was a normal procedure to
help disguise the car for "normal
criminal investigations." He said that
cars operating near San Jose State are
frequently equipped with parking stick
ers for that institution.
