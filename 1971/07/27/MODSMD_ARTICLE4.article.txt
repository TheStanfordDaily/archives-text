# 'Free U' Quietly Ends After 6-Years
## 
### DICK GEIKIE LARRY LIEBERT News Analysis 
The Midpeninsula Free University
has quietly passed into oblivion. The
death of the five-year-old educational
experiment at last brought an end to
what a longtime observor called "a
conflict between political involvement
and doing a cultural trip."
For the last year, the Free U's
leadership came mostly from the
revolutionary group Venceremos. Final
Free U coordinator Amanda Noble, a
Venceremos member, said the project
"wasn't going to serve the people, so
we decided to disband." She said the
street people and workers which
Venceremos aims at cannot relate to
classes—"They're concerned with sur
vival."
What about the middle-class resi
dents and Stanford students who
flocked to the Free U in its early years?
Noble said the encounter groups and
candle-making they enjoyed is now
sponsored by other groups, such as

Redwood City's A.A. Acme Art Acad
emy.
And she said such activities no longer
have the great following they developed
in the years of "flower children."
"When Haight-Ashbury was strong, the
Free U was strong," she said.
But others believe the Free U's turn
toward radical action lost many of
those who came to it for more esoteric
experiences in the "counter-culture."
Venceremos members said their
victory at a January election to decide
the Free U's future proved traditional
supporters were no longer interested.
But Bob Cullenbine, former Free U
Coordinator who attended the election
charged, "The election was a dismal
affair. A Free U should be a participa
tory democracy, but that meeting was
Stalinist. Those voicing minority views
were subject to ridicule and put down
by dissenters."
Cullenbine said the Free U had
stopped offering courses of interest to
its potential students. "At one point,
we offered about 200 good courses.
The current Free U catalog has less

than 20 courses worth taking."
Asked about the Free U's folding,
Cullenbine said, "I'm almost glad it's
closing. It's embarassing to me to see
what has happened to the Free U."
Whether caused by a changing com
munity or misdirected leadership, the
Free U's membership lists dropped
from 1,200 members at its 1968 peak
to 700 last year and only 70 this
summer.
Engineering and electronics instruc
tor Lee Louden felt, "You can't mix
the political and educational areas of
the Free U." But the tensions between
innovative classes and political action
did not begin in Free U with its
Venceremos leadership. Tim Coburn,
who was close to Free U leaders in its
early months at Stanford, recalls a
1966 victory of those who wanted to
emphasize its "counter-culture" ap
proach over political support of the
Black Panthers and Peace and Freedom
party.

But he said those "cultural" advo
cates themselves took to the streets to
protest when the Free U was unable to
find a permanent home in Palo Alto.
And he said further political action
came when Free U leaders became
involved in Stanford's 1969 April Third
Movement and Be-ins and street pro
tests in Palo Alto in the summers of
1969 and 1970.
Many observors agree the interaction
of political projects and counter-culture
classes was crucial to the Free U's
experiment in "relevant education."
But what is unclear is whether the
balance inevitably had to tip from
encounter sessions and candle-making
to direct action.
Coburn said, "They're are many very
political people who are sorry to see
the Free U go. It had a mellow
atmosphere around it and a collection
of diverse people. People were incor
porating things like its bread-baking
classes into their daily lives."

Coburn said, "They're are many very
political people who are sorry to see
the Free U go. It had a mellow

MRS. HARRIS SINGS—Joan Baez Harris, wife of the famous Stanford alumnus,
appeared in Frost Ampitheater last week-end. While the crowd of 10,000 enjoyed
the concert from inside the Ampitheater, several hundred were turned away in an
effort to keep the audience at a manageable size.
The Midpeninsula Free University
has quietly passed into oblivion. The
death of the five-year-old educational
experiment at last brought an end to
what a longtime observor called "a
conflict between political involvement
and doing a cultural trip."
For the last year, the Free U's
leadership came mostly from the
revolutionary group Venceremos. Final
Free U coordinator Amanda Noble, a
Venceremos member, said the project
"wasn't going to serve the people, so
we decided to disband." She said the
street people and workers which
Venceremos aims at cannot relate to
classes—"They're concerned with sur
vival."
What about the middle-class resi
dents and Stanford students who
flocked to the Free U in its early years?
Noble said the encounter groups and
candle-making they enjoyed is now
sponsored by other groups, such as

Redwood City's A.A. Acme Art Acad
emy.
And she said such activities no longer
have the great following they developed
in the years of "flower children."
"When Haight-Ashbury was strong, the
Free U was strong," she said.
But others believe the Free U's turn
toward radical action lost many of
those who came to it for more esoteric
experiences in the "counter-culture."
Venceremos members said their
victory at a January election to decide
the Free U's future proved traditional
supporters were no longer interested.
But Bob Cullenbine, former Free U
Coordinator who attended the election
charged, "The election was a dismal
affair. A Free U should be a participa
tory democracy, but that meeting was
Stalinist. Those voicing minority views
were subject to ridicule and put down
by dissenters."
Cullenbine said the Free U had
stopped offering courses of interest to
its potential students. "At one point,
we offered about 200 good courses.
The current Free U catalog has less

than 20 courses worth taking."
Asked about the Free U's folding,
Cullenbine said, "I'm almost glad it's
closing. It's embarassing to me to see
what has happened to the Free U."
Whether caused by a changing com
munity or misdirected leadership, the
Free U's membership lists dropped
from 1,200 members at its 1968 peak
to 700 last year and only 70 this
summer.
Engineering and electronics instruc
tor Lee Louden felt, "You can't mix
the political and educational areas of
the Free U." But the tensions between
innovative classes and political action
did not begin in Free U with its
Venceremos leadership. Tim Coburn,
who was close to Free U leaders in its
early months at Stanford, recalls a
1966 victory of those who wanted to
emphasize its "counter-culture" ap
proach over political support of the
Black Panthers and Peace and Freedom
party.

But he said those "cultural" advo
cates themselves took to the streets to
protest when the Free U was unable to
find a permanent home in Palo Alto.
