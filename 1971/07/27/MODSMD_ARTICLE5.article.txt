## 'Baadasss' Gives Black Youth Summer Camp 
### CHUCK STEPHEN 
"Camp BAADASSS" is not a typical nama for a
summer camp. But the 100 youths who are bused
on-campus every weekday this summer aren't your
typical campers, either.
Under leadership of footballer Hillary Shockley
and other black athletes from Stanford, Camp
Baadasss serves black youths, 10 to 15 years old,
from East Palo Alto. It's designed to help develop
both the bodies and minds of kids who are normally
deprived of attending summer camps.
Baadasss stands for Black Athletes' Academic
Development Association, Stanford Student Service.
The campers wear t-shirts proclaiming the camp
philosophy, "Our Mind is Our Body."
Shockley, star running back for Stanford's 1971
Rose Bowl champs, puts it this way:
"Sports can make a difference in life- as black
athletes, we know that. But what we also want to
teach these kids is that excellence in other fields is a
necessity.
"Just as sports itself can be constructive and can

teach the importance of perserverance, that very
factor must be applied in everything a person does."
Shocklev is assisted by several other current and
just-graduated athletes, including Demea Washington,
Arthur Smiley, Ben White, Frank Nicholson, Woody
Webb, Tom Massey, and Nate Kirtman. They organize
daily schedules combining sports—swimming, basket
ball, volleyball, football—with cultural Held trips to
museums, movies, and sites on campus. BAADASSS's
current three-week session ends next week with a
Giants game at Candlestick. The second session lasts
from Aug. 2-21.
Washington, an end on last year's football team,
considers the camp a success "from the kids' point of
view ... and that's obviously what we measure." The
black youngsters use Stanford facilities, he said, in a
set-up possible through combined efforts of the
Department of Athletics; James E. Simmons, assistant
to the president of Stanford; the Ravenswood School
District, which provides buses; and the East Palo Alto
Health Center, which provides health examinations.
The dozen supervisors are paid.

BAADASSS is free for East Palo Alto residents,
who sign up at local parks and recreational centers.
Wa...ington anticipates extending the program to the
East Menlo Park area, given the current enthusiasm
by both campers and supervisors.
The primary trouble, several supervisors joked, was
the insistence by some kids that they would come
back for next month's session "no matter what."
Only 100 spots are available. "No kid at the regular,
'expensive' Stanford camp would ever think of
talking back to the supervisors about that," said
Washington.
Shockley thought that BAADASSS, with its
current appeal, could be expanded, .. as a real,
joint university-community project" for deprived
kids.
"As Stanford students," he said, "we have been
provided skills and potentials which can be put at the
immediate disposal of deprived communities.
"We believe that a well-coordinated and compre
hensive program centered around sports will be quite
inspiring and will give some direction to youths who
otherwise might not have the opportunity."
