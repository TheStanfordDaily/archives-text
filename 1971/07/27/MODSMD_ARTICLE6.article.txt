## Significance Of 'Coming Out' 
### 
Very often self-acceptance, by
a homosexual can be a very
difficult process. The following
interview gives insights into how
this individual came to accept
himself. His name is withheld for
reasons explained in the text.
Q. How do you know you're gay?
A. Hum. . . How do you
know... YOU JUST KNOW.
You're either attracted to males
or females. At the time I began to
notice that I was more than
normally attracted to males, I was
still you know, it was kind of a
fifty-fifty thing.
Q. As you think back now, when
do you think you became gay?
A. I would probably have to say
fourteen, the onset of puberty. I'd
have to say that 'cause that's
when I became more sexually
aware of everything.
Q. When did you come out;
A. Well, I had a friend who asked
me to a gay function. He was
taking a chance. He didn't know I
had been dropping hints all along
the way. I was the one that had
suspected him for a long time.
Q. Do you feel guilty?
A. I'd have to say yes.
Q. About what?
A. About being gay, period. I
mean that's the way you're raised.
Q. Are you enjoying yourself now
that you're out?
A. Yes.
Q. Are things better than before
you were out?
A. Yes, much more.
Q. How?
A. It's the peace of mind. I'm
being what I am. I don't have to
play act, I mean you do,
sometimes, but now, at least,
within the gay crowd I can be
myself and that means an awful
lot.
Q. If you have peace of mind,
why do you feel guilty?
A. Because of the fact that after
22 years of being told that gay is

bad and so on, throughout my
entire life, the Church, my parents
and society in general, that gay is
a taboo thing. I didn't want to be
gay. I wanted to be straight. I
wanted to have a family and have
the whole thing, the whole middle
class smear.
Q. And what about the attitudes
of society?
A. I've taken sociology and so I
can see that homosexuality can be
rather detrimental to society so I
can see from a sociological point

of view that that could be a valid
reason for being down on homo
sexuals but I really think that it is
unfortunate because it is merely a
question of how tolerant a society
is.
There have been societies that,
and there probably still are, I'm
not that familiar, condone homo
sexual activity and I don't see
why this one can't either. I think
that we've made strides, GLF and
other efforts, have made great
strides in that direction. We're
becoming more and more accept
ed.
Q. Let's get to some more
personal things? Do your parents
know?
A. No, they don't know. And
they would probably disown me.
They probably would not under
stand. My mother might. She
might forgive me in the long run,
but at first it would be a
traumatic thing: "Oh my God,
where did we go wrong!" The
whole thing. I think she would
feel that it was much more a
greater hurt to her than feeling
any compassion or anything for
me. She would feel "Where did I
go wrong?"
Q. Did she go wrong?
A. Not as far as I am concerned.
But from her point of view, yes.
Don't you think your mother
would think the same thing?
Q. What do you expect now?
Where are you going?
A. I don't know.
Q. Do you expect to get married
to a woman?
A. No.
Q. Would you marry a man if the
legal opportunities were available?

q. do you feel guilty? a. ...yes.

A. Probably, yes, it would have to
be quite a person.
Q. Wouldn't that be the same if it
was a woman?
A. Yes, it would.
Q. You would marry someone if
the legal opportunities were avail
able?
A. Yes.
Q. What would you say to
someone who's still a closet queen
or hasn't come out yet?
A. First of all I would say, you
know, that you've got to decide

for yourself whether you want to
come out because if you don't it
can be a bad thing.
If you don't want to come out
and possibly do, it can be a very
bad thing. With money problems
and other things. You can have all
kinds of problems. If you want to
get into the gay scene and you
know what it's all about and you
understand yourself it can be
really a nice thing.
Now certainly some of the gay
relationships are rather tenuous
and you would be the first one to

anonymous

admit, that the poor dears cer
tainly can be tacky but in general
I've probably met more really
fantastic people and had more
people do really nice things for
me since I've been out than in all
the other twenty-two years that I
have lived.
Gay people, I think, for one
reason or another, I don't know
what reason it is, stick together
and some of them will really do
some wonderful things for you.
And there are some truely, truely
talented people, which I appre
ciate.
Q. Are you glad you came out?
A. Yes. I might have gotten
married, had kids, been miserable
the entire time, knowing that I
was gay and wanting to express
my gay feeling, but unable to,
simply because I did not know
how to and becuase of the fact
that society dictated to me that I
must be straight and get married
and have kids and a $30,000
house and the whole thing. That's
what I might have done. I would
have had no choice then.
Q. What's that?
A. Homosexuality, being gay.
That means a viable alternative.
