## Nixon & Chou: What Does It Mean? 
### 
concerned asain scholars

The President's unexpected an
nouncement last week of his
intention to visit the People's
Republic of China raises many
questions for American opponents
of U.S. intervention in Indo-
China.
What does a possible U.S. —
China rapprochement mean for
the Indochinese people who have
suffered so long at the hand of
U.S. aggression? What concessions
have or will be made vis a vis the
Indochina conflict? These ques
tions are likely to remain un
answered except by the unfolding
of events. But a look at the

convergence and divergence of
interests between the powers
interacting in Asia may serve to
define the realm of possibilities.
In Chou's recent interview with
a group of Concerned Asian
Scholars visiting China, the pre
mier seemed to be standing
strongly behind the provisional
Revolutionary Government's sev
en point peace proposal. Chou
En-Lai's assertion that U.S. mili
tary withdrawal from all of
Indochina must precede the im
provement of U.S. — China
relations indicated considerable
Chinese-Vietnamese concurrence
on these issues.
Tensions Exist
Some tensions undoubtedly
exist—as reflected in Vietnamese
statements opposing "big power"
attempts to resolve the war and
different preferences as to the
appropriate avenues for resolution
—the Paris talks or the Chinese
suggestion of a Geneva-type con
ference with a more Asian cast.

The 1954 Geneva Conference
can be seen as a settlement in
which the Chinese convinced the
Vietnamese to give up more than
in retrospect may have been wise.
Also the Sihanouk—led Indochina
United Front is a channel of
increased Chinese influence and
may be a source of friction with
the Vietnamese.
Of course China is in no
position to impose a highly
undesirable settlement on the
Vietnamese—the Vietnamese can
continue to play off China and
the U.S.S.R., Hanoi's main sup
porters, to preserve its own
independence of action.
Many Problems
Many problems stand in the
way of substantively improved
U.S.-China relations. Most impor
tant is the Indochina War, but also
listed by Chou are Taiwan, S.
Korea, and the important Chinese
fear of revived Japanese militariza
tion. China's diplomatic initia
tives vis a vis the U.S. (and it

seems China has had the initiative)
seem motivated primarily by fear
of the U.S.S.R. and Japan.
Improving China-U.S. relations
gives China more leverage on these
fronts. Beyond public relations
coups, substantive impovement of
relations must mean U.S. conces
sions on the issues of Indochina
and Taiwan. How far is Nixon
willing to go? Why?
These are big questions. Have
Nixon and Kissinger suddenly
realized the existence of a legiti
mate Chinese sphere of influence
in Asia? That the U.S. is "over
extented?" That the war is a huge
domestic political liability? Will
Nixon accept neutralization of
Indochina? A coalition govern
ment with the NLF? Is the role of
peacemaker sufficiently rewarding
for Nixon's political ambitions
while the right-wing labels it a
sell-out?
Or can dramatic moves be used
to cover up lack of real movement
toward withdrawal from Indo
china? Threat of losing the in

vitation certainly puts limits on
any military initiatives by Nixon.
Or would Nixon be willing to lose
the invitation to reassert a hard
line? U.S. policy seems to be
changing, but how far, in what
direction, and with what consis
tency is not yet known.
Nixon's movement can at least
be used to knock down b'asre
tenets of cold war ideology:'
"Containment" of an "aggressive
China" or "wars of liberation as
instruments of Chinese (or N.
Vietnamese) aggression" certainly
lose credibility in a world Where
Nixon talks to Mao.
However, the American peofM$ J
must not be fooled by apparent
moves toward peace—the U.S. has
yet to negotiate seriously in Paris,
or reduce its level of bombing.
And it is these concrete moves
toward peace that we must
continue to demand of Washing
ton.
