## Psychiatric Slavery & Voucher System 
### 
bill evers

The July/August issue of the
Humanist (published by the
American Humanist Association
and the American Ethical Union)
contains a special symposium oh
involuntary commitment to men
tal hospitals.
The two most important arti
cles are by Thomas Szasz, profes
sor of psychiatry at the State
University of New York medical
center at Syracuse, and Alan
Dershowitz of Harvard Law
School.
Szasz is an indefatigable oppon
ent of involuntary commitment

and is one of the founders of a
new organization, the American
Association for the Abolition of
Involuntary Mental Hospitaliza
tion. (A.A.A.I.M.H.'s platform is
printed in full on pages 64-65 of
the January 1971 Playboy.)
In his article in the Humanist,
Szasz compares the practice of
involuntary commitment with
slavery in the antebellum South:
"The practice of 'sane' men
incarcerating their 'insane' fellow
men in 'mental hospitals' can be
compared to that of white men
enslaving black men . ..
"In free societies, the relation
ship between physician and pa
tient is predicated on the legal
presumption that a person 'owns'
his body and his personality. John
Stuart Mill explicitly affirmed
that 'each person is the proper
guardian of his own health,

whether bodily, or mental and
spiritual.'.. .
"The fundamental parallel be
tween master and slave, on the
one hand, and institutional
psychiatrist and involuntarily
hospitalized patient, on the other,
lies in this: In each instance, the
former member of the pair defines
the social role of the latter, and
casts him in that role by force."
Huge Stake
Szasz goes on to point out:
"The psychiatric profession has,
of course, a huge stake, both
existential and economic, in being
socially authorized to rule over
mental patients, just as the slave
owning classes did in ruling over
slaves.
"In contemporary psychiatry,
indeed, the expert gains superior
ity not only over members of a

specific class of victims, but over
nearly the whole of the popula
tion, whom he may 'psych iatjseal
ly evaluate.' "
In his article, "Two Models of
Commitment: The Medical and
the Legal," Dershowitz says:"The
initial and fundamental question
that must be asked by any system
authorizing incarceration is. Which
harms are sufficiently serious to
justify resort to this rather severe
sanction? The question is a&ed
and answered in the criminaljaw
by the substantive of
crime." *
The McNaughten rule that the
ability to distinguish right from
wrong should be the test of legal
responsibility for one's actions is,
according to Dershowitz, a "per
fectly rational legal rule." But
members of the psychiatric oro-
fession have sought to substitute a
"medical model" for functional
legal criteria.
Meaningless Model
Instead of asking the proper
questions, the medical model's
operative language is vague and
meaningless: "Is the person men
tally ill? Is he dangerous to
himself or others? Is he in need of
care or treatment?"
The present situation gives the
psychiatric expert power to
authorize involuntary hospitaliza
tion on the basis of his own value
judgments: "The statutes author
ize preventive incarceration of
mentally ill persons who are likely
to injure themselves or others.
"Generally, 'injure' is not fur
ther defined in the statutes or in
the case law, and the critical
decision, that is, whether a pre
dicted pattern of behavior is
sufficiently injurious to warrant
incarceration is relegated to the
unarticulated judgments of the
psychiatrist."
The use of coercion against a
person to prevent self-harm, Der
showitz points out, was challeng
ed by John Stuart Mill in his essay

On Liberty. Mill considered it
fundamental "that the only pur
pose for which power can be
rightfully exercised against any
member of a civilized community,
against his will, is to prevent harm
to others. He cannot rightfully be
compelled to do or forebear
because it will be better for him
to do so, because it will make him
happier, because... to do so
would be wise or even right."
In his conclusion, Dershowitz
contends, "the issue is not for
lawyers alone: The average person
can predict with some confidence
that he will never stand accused of
committing some serious crime.
Can he be as confident that he
will never confront the process of
commitment?"

The Wall Street Journal of July
23 has a letter to the editor on the
voucher plan and family choice in
education from Dr. E.E. Bleck of
Citizens for Educational Freedom,
who writes:
"We feel that the people must
come to grips with the fact that
education in the primary and
secondary years is compulsory.
Furthermore, the state has the

coercive power to tax to support
their own educational system,
which is not public but only that
confined to the state-controlled
and operated school system.
"We believe that all families
and children have a right to share
in tax dollars collected for com
pulsory education, and that such
moneys be spent for whatever
school suits that child and family
best, be it Baptist, atheist, black,
Catholic, free-school, etc.
"Such a concept recognizes the
cultural pluralism that exists in
America ... In application such
sharing of educational tax dollars
is no different from that of the GI
Bill of Rights or the California
State Scholarship Program in
higher education."
I think that Dr. Bleck's points
are well taken. Nonetheless, while
I would prefer the voucher system
to the present system under which
Catholic parents pay twice for
education, in addition, compul
sory attendance laws and the
taxation of the childless to subsi
dize the education of members of
other families must be called into
question.
Furthermore, there is a grave
danger that under the voucher
system an Educational Voucher
Authority would be set up to
regulate and standardize public
and private schools receiving
vouchers. Such a regulatory
agency would expand the govern
ment's domain to include the
private schools.
