## Psychiatric Slavery & Voucher System 
### 
bill evers

The July/August issue of the
Humanist (published by the
American Humanist Association
and the American Ethical Union)
contains a special symposium oh
involuntary commitment to men
tal hospitals.
The two most important arti
cles are by Thomas Szasz, profes
sor of psychiatry at the State
University of New York medical
center at Syracuse, and Alan
Dershowitz of Harvard Law
School.
Szasz is an indefatigable oppon
ent of involuntary commitment

and is one of the founders of a
new organization, the American
Association for the Abolition of
Involuntary Mental Hospitaliza
tion. (A.A.A.I.M.H.'s platform is
printed in full on pages 64-65 of
the January 1971 Playboy.)
In his article in the Humanist,
Szasz compares the practice of
involuntary commitment with
slavery in the antebellum South:
"The practice of 'sane' men
incarcerating their 'insane' fellow
men in 'mental hospitals' can be
compared to that of white men
enslaving black men . ..
"In free societies, the relation
ship between physician and pa
tient is predicated on the legal
presumption that a person 'owns'
his body and his personality. John
Stuart Mill explicitly affirmed
that 'each person is the proper
guardian of his own health,

whether bodily, or mental and
spiritual.'.. .
"The fundamental parallel be
tween master and slave, on the
one hand, and institutional
psychiatrist and involuntarily
hospitalized patient, on the other,
lies in this: In each instance, the
former member of the pair defines
the social role of the latter, and
casts him in that role by force."
Huge Stake
Szasz goes on to point out:
"The psychiatric profession has,
of course, a huge stake, both
existential and economic, in being
socially authorized to rule over
mental patients, just as the slave
owning classes did in ruling over
slaves.
"In contemporary psychiatry,
indeed, the expert gains superior
ity not only over members of a

specific class of victims, but over
nearly the whole of the popula
tion, whom he may 'psych iatjseal
ly evaluate.' "
In his article, "Two Models of
Commitment: The Medical and
the Legal," Dershowitz says:"The
initial and fundamental question
that must be asked by any system
authorizing incarceration is. Which
harms are sufficiently serious to
justify resort to this rather severe
sanction? The question is a&ed
and answered in the criminaljaw
by the substantive of
crime." *
The McNaughten rule that the
ability to distinguish right from
wrong should be the test of legal
responsibility for one's actions is,
according to Dershowitz, a "per
fectly rational legal rule." But
