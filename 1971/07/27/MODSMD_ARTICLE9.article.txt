## NASA And The Scientists

Now that Apollo 15 issafely(?)
on its way to the Moon,
perhaps it's time to take a look at
the space program, and see where
it's going.
One of the most significant
aspects of the Apollo 15 flight, is
that it is almost the last. The
manned Moon exploration pro
gram is moribund. Apollo 16 will
be launched next March, and
Apollo 17 in December, 1972.
After that, manned missions will
be restricted to Earth orbits.
The Apollo program was origin
ally slated to have 19 flights, but
the NASA Administration, sensing
the mood of the purse-strings,
deleted a couple of flights in order
to reallocate the funds to advanc
ed projects.
Last Chance
So, Apollo 15 represents one of
the last chances we will have for
many years to watch the Moon on
live television.
Why did Congress urge a cut
back on Moon flights? I'm afraid
that I am a hopeless cynic. They
didn't do it because they wanted
to pump more money into the
cities, or into education, or even
into unmanned space exploration.
They did it because the large
rockets and other pieces of
expensive hardware that kept the
aerospace industry thumping for
years have been built, and there is
little political capital in continu
ing to fund Apollo.
Essentially, Apollo has ceased
to be a lucrative engineering
project, employing hundreds of
thousands of blue and white-collar
workers, and filling the coffers of
hundreds of companies, large and
small.
It has become a scientific
project, one which promises to
return knowledge that would be
of interest, at least initially, only
to a handful of specialists in such
arcane fields as geology, chemis
try, biology and physics.
NASA, of course, has done its
part to keep the program as
hardware-oriented as possible.
Many years ago, with great splash
and hoopla, NASA announced a
training program for scientist
astronauts. Rosparchers from all
over the United States were
recruited to undergo astronaut
training, with the lure of making
in situ measurements on the moon
and in interplanetary space be
tween the Earth and the Moon.
Only Test Pilots
To date, not one scientist
astronaut has left the Earth. The
men who have made the Moon
trip have all been test pilots. In its
infancy, of course, the program
needed test-pilots, for the goal of
the early flights was to test

equipment, not to carry on
scientific studies.
By now, everyone is pretty
satisfied that the equipment
works just fine (in spite of the
Apollo 13 misadventure, which
was beyond the control of the
astronauts anyway). Even though
each flight involves a new toy to
be tested, such as the LRV (that's
Lunar Roving Vehicle, the Model
T of the heavens), there is really
no excuse for continuing to
exclude scientists from lunar
flights.
NASA is probably aware of
this. I guess it's just a matter of
bum luck that scientists were
expected to participate in the
later flights, the ones that were
deleted for budgetary reasons.
The nation's scientists have not
been silent on the subject. In a
report issued by the National
Academy of Sciences (Priorities
for Space Research 1971-1980,
Washington, D.C., 1971) the
Space Science Board of NAS takes
NASA to task:
".. . we believe that failure to
use the investment already made
in Apollo systems for lunar
exploration will amount to a
waste of national resources and
will greatly diminish the scientific
significance of the Apollo pro
gram."
Learning Experience
On the other hand, according
to a booklet written by Gene
Simmons, Chief Scientist of the
Manned Spacecraft Center (On
The Moon With Apollo 15, an
excellent guide for the layman),
"The [Apollo 15J astronauts
have learned much about science,
and in particular, about lunar
science . . . They are able to set up
experiments, such as those of
ALSEP [Apollo Lunar Surface
Experiments Package], but more
importantly, they understand the
scientific purposes behind the
various experiments.
".. . obviously anyone can pick
up rocks with which to fill boxes
and bags. Only a person highly
trained in the goesciences, how
ever, can properly select those few
rocks from many that are likely to
yield the greatest amount of
scientific return when examined
in minute detail in the laboratory
back on Earth .. . The prime crew
has been especially fortunate in
having the constant geologic tute
lage of Astronaut Jack Schmitt, a
geologist himself."
That last gentleman, Dr. Jack
Schmitt, "a geologist himself," is
one of those scientist-astronauts
who signed up to go to the moon,
and is on the Apollo 15 back-up
crew.
Why isn't he on this flight,
instead of tutoring the prime crew

in the difference between a rock
and a rille? Why is he on the
back-up crew instead of on board
Apollo 15 right now, on his way
to where he could do the most
good for the program and for
himself?
Same Question
It's the same question I asked
myself last March when Alan
Shepard raised the first lunar
divot, endearing himself (and
presumably the manned space
program) to the Sunday duffer.
Shepard—instead of a scientist
—was on board Apollo 14 because
his good friend and former test
pilot-astronaut, Dick Slayton,was
virtually in charge of picking
astronauts.
It is NASA's internal political
machinations that determine who
flies and who doesn't, and in the
Byzantine world of NASA poli
tics, the scientists lose.
But all this is beating a dying
horse. What new programs does
your Space Agency have up its
celestial sleeve?
The biggest engineering project
(and hence, the most expensive)
to be seen in the next decade will
be Sky lab, an orbiting space
station that will keep trained
observors (presumably a high
portion of whowi will be scien
tists, but many of whom will be
Air Force), alive and happy for
weeks at a time in orbit above the
Earth. The station will be served
by re-usable rocket boosters, a
sort of space shuttle. Money has
already been appropriated for
preliminary design of the re-usable
rockets.
Intriguing Future
By far the most intriguing of
the "science" projects to be
tackled in the next decade is the
so-called Grand Tour of the outer
planets. A few years ago, some
clever fellow pointed out that the
planets of the outer solar system
(those planets that lie beyond the
orbit of Mars) will be in a unique
position at the end of this decade
to be studied by a single space
craft. The next such favorable
alignment will not occur for 175
years.
Curiously (or perhaps, not so
curiously),the National Academy
of Sciences report mentioned

above downgrades the Grand
Tour to lowest priority, because
the scientists who worked on the
study are afraid that NASA's
preoccupation with a giant project
will lead to a neglect of smaller,
less-expensive, but highly produc
tive experiments.
Ironically, although the NAS
report apparently carried little
weight with NASA, the Senate
Committee on Aeronautical and
Space Sciences took it to heart,
and lopped off $20 million of
NASA's $30 million request for
the Grand Tour, and applied it to
the scientifically unproductive
Nerva rocket engine, a pet project
of Chairman Clinton F. Anderson
and Senator Howard D. Cannon;
the House later restored half the
cut.
NASA'S Earth-oriented pro
jects should start becoming visible
in the next few years. Weather
satellites have already made some
impact in improving predictions.
As part of the Global Atmos
pheric Research Program (GARP),
NASA will be launching new
measuring instruments with the
goal of achieving accurate ten-day
forecasts by the end of the
decade.
The Earth Resources program,
which seeks to use satellites to aid
in governing natural resources, got
a big boost this year with a NASA
project to monitor corn blight in
the midwest.
Since Earth Resources has great
pork-barrel appeal, Congress is
interested, and the program
should pick up quite a bit of
support in the future.
Meanwhile, Apollo 15 is on its
way to the Moon, and we must all
wish the three passengers our best.
The television pictures from the
Moon are supposed to be superb,
so don't miss them. In order to
catch the prime-time audience,
NASA has scheduled the moon
rides to begin at 6:24 a.m.
Saturday, 3:44 a.m. Sunday, and
12:24 a.m. Monday, PDT.
