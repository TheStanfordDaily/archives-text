I Today is July 30, 1971. On this day, in the year 1971, the
X Stanford Daily turned over its opinion page to the forces of \
\ Women's Liberation. To compensate for this gross lack of \
X objectivity, the Daily ran the following definition of Woman,
ยง attributed to the students of the London Technical College:
Woman- Thought to be a member of the human race. Seldom ),
X found in natural state. Surface coated with paint. Has low \
\ boiling temp and freezing point varies. . . Highly explosive. %
% Extremely active when in the vicinity of the opposite sex. \
X Chiefly ornamental. Probably the most powerful seducing agent \
X known. Illegal to own more than one specimen. ),
If you know of anyone owning more than one specimen, call
our business office at 321-2300, ext. 4632. We'd be happy to $
X take up some of the slack. If you would like to advertise for (or
against) a liberated woman, call our business office at ext. 4630. \
The Stanford Daily regrets that not one female member of its
X vaunted softball team turned up for our first game, against the \
\ Biology Department. Those of us there felt so guilty, we blew
the game 12-7 (congratulations, bio!). If you'd like to arrange a \
\ game with us, we promise our team will be fully integrated.
