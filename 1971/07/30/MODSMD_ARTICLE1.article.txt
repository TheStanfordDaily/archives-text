# Grand Jury Probes Area Radicals
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
A secret federal grand jury in San
Francisco has reportedly begun investi
gating revolutionaries throughout the
Bay Area.
Reports of the grand jury became
public this week when a Richmond
member of the Revolutionary Union
(RU) told a San Francisco radio station
that she had been subpoenaed. An
informed source has confirmed that the
jury has been operating for "quite some
time" and is investigating radicals
belonging to many different organiza
tions.
RU member Linda Reyonds called
KSAN, an FM rock station, and told
newsman Dave McQueen that she had
been subpoenaed to appear before the
grand jury Thursday, August 5. Accord
ing to McQueen, she believed she would
be questioned about possession and
transport of explosives.

Reynolds was among those arrested
in an April 5 raid on a Richmond RU
collective, where police said they found
marijuana and four sticks of dynamite.
Those in the house denied the charges,
which were dropped later.
A source involved with government
intelligence agencies told the Daily that
the grand jury has been gathering
evidence about revolutionaries for a
number of weeks, with most informa
tion until now apparently coming from
police agents. The source said the
investigations in search of criminal
indictments would range from funding
of the Black Panther newspaper to
Redwood City's Venceremos.
He suggested Stanford's suspended
English Professor Bruce Franklin, a
Venceremos leader, is one of the targets
of Justice Department prosecutors
bringing evidence to the jury. And he
said a Santa Cruz Mountain "bomb
factory," which police charge was run
by former Stanford radical James
Johnson, is also likely to be studied.
He indicated a second activist has
also been subpoenaed, although that
person could not be reached to confirm
the report.
Federal grand juries for this region
meet behind closed doors in San

Francisco's Federal Building. They
gather evidence about suspected illegal
acts and issue criminal indictments
when they believe sufficient evidence
has been shown to press charges.
The source contacted yesterday said
the grand jury involved is a special
panel authorized by the Nixon admini
stration's "strike force against organiz
ed crime." U.S. Attorney for Northern
California James Browning refused to
either confirm or deny reports of a
grand jury focusing on radicals.
But he confirmed that the "strike
force" grand jury, formed under the
Organized Crime Act of 1970, has been
investigating areas other than mob
racketeering. He said the law allows it
to investigate any crimes, even though
it has special powers to continue
beyond the 18-month limit placed on
regular juries.
Rumors of an impending grand jury
have been circulating among local
revolutionaries for several months.
Some radicals suggested the jury would
rely heavily on Senate testimony
delivered in February and March by
former Stanford radical-turned-FBl
informer Thomas Edward Mosher.
Bruce Franklin said, "We'd been
figuring all along there would be a

grand jury designed to attack the
movement on many different levels.
They'll probably hit the whole Bay
Area."
He charged "there are no protections
of rights" for those called before grand
juries. A grand jury can compel a
witness to testify in spite of his pleas of
self-incrimination by granting him im
munity from any prosecution based on
the statements.
A grand jury investigating radicals
would be unlikely to call well-known
activists because the immunity granted
would protect them from later prose
cution.
Franklin said "They're acting like
there is some kind of conspiracy
(among radicals) when they're the ones
who are sliding under rocks." He called
the investigation a "fishing expedi
tion."
But referring to general policy,
Browning said, "You've got to give the
government prosecutors some credit in
not wasting a lot of time and striking
out blindly in many different direc
tions." He said the government lawyers
do not "make cases out of thin air."
Browning insisted "particular crimi
nal acts of particular persons" are
investigated rather than entire radical
groups.
