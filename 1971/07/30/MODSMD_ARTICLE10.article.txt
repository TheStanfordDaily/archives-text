"i. If he says, 7 won't be home for dinner
tonight, don't wait up for me,' don't ask where he
is going. Such a question gives the impression you
do not trust him.
"2. If he comes in very late, don't ask where he
has been. Such a question gives the impression you
are insecure.
"3. Keep his clothes in perfect condition.
"4. Keep his stomach full.

"5. Keep his car clean.
"6. Keep the kids quiet and away from him
when he comes home at night. Questions can drive
a father crazy—especially if he doesn't know the
answers.
"7. Give him plenty of sex no matter how tired
you are or what kind of day you've had.
"& Don't ask him for money.
"9. Starve yourself if you must, but stay a size
10 forever. Never mention the fact that he has
gained 30 pounds and the seams in his pants are
splitting.
"10. Don't tell him your troubles. A woman
who stays home all day shouldn't have any."
