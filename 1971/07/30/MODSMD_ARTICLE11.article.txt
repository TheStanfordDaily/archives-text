In order to do that someone has to convince the
Stanford Trustees that it would be in their best
interests to admit more women. I think quotas that
discriminate against anyone on the basis of sex,
color, political views (the potential you have for
becoming a radical or whatever) or whether you're
Jewish or English should definitely be eliminated.
Submissiveness
Next, and hardest, we have got to stop bringing
up women to believe there is something instinctive
which demands that we be submissive, not only
physically (when the time is right), but also
intellectually. We've got to stop believing that we
were not only doomed to be slaves, but doomed to
love every minute of it.
If the word slave bothers you, look at an Italian
contessa's analysis in this month's issue of "Vogue"

(The following letter, which
was signed by 19 women and men
(mostly in the Anthropology
Department) was also sent to
President Lyman and Dr. James
McClenahan, director of Cowell
Student Health Service.)
Cowell Student Health Service
was established to serve the
normal medical needs of the
student population at Stanford.
One in six graduate students and
one in three undergraduates at
Stanford are women, but this fact
is ignored at Cowell.
The gynecological serervices at
Stanford are inadequate, and have
been so for many years. The
recent concession with respect to
the Pill has been counteracted by
a worsening of other services. To
be specific:
1. Due to the shortage of
gynecologists at Cowell, gynecol
ogy appointments have to be
made at least a month ahead, a
situation that has been true for at
least four years. There has been
no apparent effort to fill this
demand by hiring another part- or
full-time gynecologist.
2. There are a number of simple
and repetitive checks for serious
diseases (such as TB) which are
required or recommended for
everyone. The Pap smear, a test
for uterine cancer, is an annual
check strongly recommended for
every female past puberty, and
required for women using contra
ceptives. Uterine cancer is one of
the most common forms of cancer
among women and is curable if
caught early. Regular Pap smears
have drastically reduced the inci
dence of uterine cancer in the
U.S.
Until this year, when Cowell
started to issue contraceptives, the
Pap smear was a "normal service"
and free to students. Now it costs
$7.50, which some of us cannot
afford to pay. Planned Parent
hood does it at cost for $1.75.
3. Cowell has finally accepted
the responsibility of dispensing
contraceptives to students, but it
is still very ambivalent about it.
Sexual activity is a reality among
Stanford men and women, and
the burden for contraception rests
solely on the latter.
Cowell puts many obstacles in
the way of a woman—whether
legally adult or not, married or
single—who wish to postpone
childbearing: the one-month wait
for the gynecologist, the $7.50
Pap smear test, an unusually high
charge for contraceptives (twice
the local commercial price), and
an apparent ruling against des
pensing of lUD's.
Cowell's policy towards health
services for women reflects the
attitudes of a society which makes
women ashamed of their bodies
and ignorant of their health needs.
Women's health problems are thus
treated as low-priority both by
Cowell and by themselves
The idea that the health needs
of women are those of a minor
"special interest group" and there
fore optional is merely a reflec

tion of other inequalities at
Stanford. Football players, a
much smaller group, are not
charged for treatment of their
broken limbs or their special
physicals, yet being a football
player is a matter of individual
choice, but being a woman is not.
To provide adequate care for
women at Stanford, we therefore
recommend the following
changes:
1. That an additional specialist
in gynecology be hired.
2. That the charge for Pap
smears be dropped.
3. That contraceptive advice
which explains and evaluates all
available alternatives be given to
both men and women.
4. That all contraceptives be
available on campus at the lowest
possible cost.
sisterhood
Editor, The Daily:
Some days I think that the new
Woman's awakening and sister
hood is wasting its energies
energies we need to direct toward
our goals. While we should be
developing our own potentials,
individually and as a group, we
should learn not to adopt the
tactics of those we are in close
contact or conflict with—we have
to learn not to condemn others
while we leave the doors open for
all possible desires of woman.
As example of wasted energies I
see that often we alienate those

of why American women supposedly make such
lousy lovers. She says that we do not have the
proper attitude towards slavery. We keep fighting it.
According to her we just refuse to accept the fact
that a woman was made to want nothing more than
to serve a man, devotedly, completely, without
asking why, and without any complaints.
I hate to sound Stalinist, but we have to destroy
ideas like these; they serve only to oppress women.
I'm not suggesting thatwe,as women,should pick up
the gun against all men and their conspirators and
"by opposing them thus end them;" that would not
only be incorrect, but lonely.
I want to join with men to end our mutual
oppression by society. As Chairman Mao says:
"Genuine equality between the sexes can only be
realized in the socialist transformation of society as
a whole."

women who have worked for
goals we all want by themselves
and for themselves; we may ask
for persons who are contented
with their lives to change because
we disapprove of one facet. We
ask persons who have striven hard
to strive harder when the concern
should be in developing ourselves
mentally, physically and emotion
ally and learning to accept others
for themselves.
We must decide that men and
women who disagree with our
goals are not our enemies, but our
partners on this earth with whom
we must learn to live.
What are these goals for which
we as women should work? Well,
I'm sure that everyone defines
them differently, so here goes
another attempt. They are:
1. The ability to develop
ourselves to our fullest potential
in whatever way, and for whatever
we decide;
2. to receive full credit (money
or otherwise) for what we do;
3. to be able to have free choice
in when (and if) we have children;
4. to share with our mates (if
we choose marriage or living
together) the responsibilities of
the home and (if desired) child
ren; and
5. to become whole female
persons who are an important part
of the community in which we
live, and the world in which our
energies are directed.
