## State Violates Sex Rights

bill evers

(Editor's Note: This is the first in a
two-part series systematically treating
government intervention in economic matters
on a gender-related basis and in private sexual
activity. This part deals with autistic and
binary intervention. Part Two will deal with
triangular intervention, including marriage,
divorce, prostitution, pornography, labor
protective laws, and alimony.)
Men and women have equal natural rights to
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As
Angelina Grimke, feminist and abolitionist of
the pre-Civil War era, used to explain, all
human beings have the same rights because
they are all moral beings.
These rights, however, are sometimes
violated, occasionally by their fellow human
beings acting in a private capacity, but most
often by their fellow humans acting in the
name of government.
The government is an organization which
systematically and regularly practices violent
intervention into the peaceful life of society. A
time-honored arena of government invasion of
privacy is sex-related activities. The govern
ment tries to regulate human sexuality and to
insist that differences in gender in some way
entail differences in natural rights.
In analyzing governmental intervention in
society, it is helpful to have some kind of
framework. Economics Professor Murray
Rothbard of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute
has devised a typology of intervention which
can be applied to sex-related governmental
action.
Types of Intervention
Rothbard groups interventionist activities,
according to their effects, in three categories:
autistic, binary, and triangular. In autistic
intervention, the ruler's prohibition or pre
scription is aimed directly at the subject as an
individual; there is no forcible transfer of
goods or forcible provision of services. In
binary intervention, there is a forced gift from
the subject to the ruler. In triangular
intervention, the ruler forces an involuntary
exchange of goods or services between two
subjects.
i In the class of "rulers," we must place not
'just the official members of the governmental
apparatus, but also the net beneficiaries of
governmental activity. All three types of
intervention—autistic, binary, and triangular
occur in government interference with sex
related activities in the United States.
In cases of autistic intervention, the coercive
agent imposes a pattern of behavior on others,
without taking anything material away from
them directly. The impact of autistic interven
tion falls directly on an individual as a
separate, singular entity, rather than on an
interacting pair of individuals. The root of all
sex-related autistic intervention is the claim
that the individual does not have an absolute
right to control his own mind and body.
The dissemination of birth control informa
tion and the call for abortion on demand in
the past sparked major moral controversies.
But these examples of autistic intervention are
dying out, though there still remain some
restrictions on birth control information and
on abortion.
Abortions on Demand
In Santa Ana, Calif., Dr. John S. Gwynne,

who has been arrested six times in the last 18
months for providing abortions on demand, is
now challenging the constitutionality of the
state's 1967 therapeutic abortion law. The
California law sanctions abortions in some 500
state-accredited hospitals after a panel of three
doctors has determined that a woman's
physical or emotional health would be
impaired by childbirth.
An important essay by Lucinda Cisler
(published in Notes from the Second Year and
reprinted in Sookie Stamble's Women's Libera
tion anthology and in the August 1970
"Ramparts") attacks four restrictions which
crop up in current abortion reform bills and
liberalized laws such as the one in California:
(1) Abortions may only be performed in
licensed hospitals; (2) Abortions may only be
performed by licensed physicians; (3) Abor
tions may not be performed beyond a certain
time in pregnancy, unless the woman's life is at
stake; (4) Abortions may only be performed
when the married woman's husband or the
young single woman's parents give their
consent.
Cisler refutes the rationales usually offered
for these restrictions, affirms that a woman
"belongs to herself and not to the state," and
calls for total repeal of abortion laws.
It might do well to point out that the
principle that one has an absolute right to
control one's own body, which is the principle
on which contemporary feminists have built
their case for abortion repeal, faces a new
threat in recent veiled proposals by neo-
Malthusians for compulsory birth control.
Tax Differences
In cases of binary intervention, the coercer
forces his victim to make an exchange or a
unilateral gift. The binary hegemonic relation
ship in sex-related activities involves for the
most part taxation and government expendi
tures, but it also includes forcible rape.
The inequity of differential taxation of the
married and unmarried and the subsidy of
children through tax exemptions for depen
dents are self-evident matters. But one
important aspect of incidence and effects of
taxation has almost escaped notice—the fact
that there is no taxation of the productive
activities of a housewife.
When differential rates of taxation are
applied to different lines of production, there
is a misallocation of resources. As economics
professor Edwin Dolan of Dartmouth has
pointed out: "If housewife services are
untaxed, while commercial janitorial services,
child care centers, laundries, restaurants, and
houses of prostitution are taxed, then
housewives will have a competitive edge, and
every male wanting any of these services will
be encouraged to contract for them via
marriage rather than contracting for them via
the market."
New Labor Force
Dolan gives an example of the workings of
the tax system: "Suppose a woman, before
marriage, has been trained in the skill, let us
say, of computer programming. Suppose her
marginal product as a computer programmer is
$3.00 an hour, while her marginal product as a
domestic servant is only $2.25. Clearly, it
would be good economics for her to find
employment as a programmer and hire various

specialists to fulfill the bulk of her cleaning,
cooking, and child care functions, pocketing a
clear premium of 75 cents an hour. Yet what if
her husband is already earning $10,000 a year,
putting her in the 30 percent tax bracket?
That leaves her with $2.10 takehome from her
programming job, less than enough to pay the
cooking, cleaning, and child care contractors."
Dolan suggests a tax deduction for the
purchase of commercially produced household
services. Then, "those women who did not
have a natural comparative advantage for the
performance of housework would flow into
the labor force."
(Mickey and John Rowntree's article "More
on the Political Economy of Women's
Liberation," in the January 1970 "Monthly
Review" is an excellent article on the present
status of women in the labor market.)
Rape is something which governments
generally do not aid and abet, although it has
historically been a common activity of
conquering soldiers. Nonetheless, efficient and
effective protection against rape has not been
provided by the government's police forces. A
while ago, Berkeley feminists asserted their
right to bear arms and demanded that they be
allowed to carry concealed deadly weapons in
order to fend off assailants. This seems to be a
just demand. (Of course, all persons should use
only the quantity of force necessary and
sufficient for self-defense.)
