# Vasectomies Gain Popularity
## 
### VICKI PERRIS 
"Performing a vasectomy is
about as easy as removing a wart"
says Stanford doctor John Sands.
"You could take a bum off the
streets and teach him how to
perform the operation within a
few weeks."
Vasectomy, a simple, short
operation to sterilize men, is
becoming increasingly popular.
About 100,000 of these opera
tions have been performed in the
U.S. in the last year alone, more
than the total amount for the five
years before that. Advocates call
vasectomy a sure birth-control
method and emphasize that it in
no way restricts sexual activity.
The operation itself is fairly
simple. A small incision is made in
each side of the scrotum, so that

the vas deferens (the small tubes
through which sperm travel), can
be lifted out, cut, and tied off.
This blocks the passage of sperm.
The testicle continues to produce
sperm, but it is absorbed by the
body.
Usually, a vasectomy can be
done in a doctor's office under
local anesthesia. The man can
return home afterward, and may
be back in action within a few
days. Complications are rare, and
are minor when they occur.
Men are not sterile immediately
after the operation, and it may
take up to six weeks for the
remaining sperm in the testicles to
be eliminated. A sperm count is
made after a few weeks to be sure
that no sperm remain in the
sexual fluid, and some other form

of contraception must be used
until then.
Though men become sterile
soon after the operation, a vasec
tomy has no effect on a man's
sexual drive, and in fact many
men enjoy sexual intercourse
more once the fear of an unwant
ed pregnancy has been removed.
Pat Sheeran, the Executive Direc
tor of the San Mateo Planned
Parenthood Association, reports
that many men's wives are "jubi
lant" about their husbands' having
had the operation, because they
no longer have to worry about
birth control methods.
The simple procedure costs less
than $150 through a private
physician. But San Mateo's Plan
ned Parenthood clinic, with the
help of a federal grant, is the
state's first clinic offering free
vasectomies to men with low
incomes. The operations are per
formed once a week, on Thursday
night, by a doctor from the
Stanford Medical Center. Four
vasectomies are performed each
Thursday.
To be elligible for a vasectomy
at the San Mateo clinic, a man
must have an income of less than
$7000 and have no insurance plan
which would cover the cost of the
operation. The clinic arranges the
operation for men who cannot

afford the high cost of private
medical care.
Before a man is placed on the
two-month waiting list for the
operation, counseling is done at
the San I\4teo clinic to be sure
that the operation is in the best
interest of the man and his wife.
Sheeran, who is a qualified
counselor, says the average couple
coming to the clinic is . . white,
and Catholic, with two children.
The men are usually around
thirty, and the wives a little
younger."
Sheeran said that he might
deny some couples the operation,
if there were a valid reason, but so
far it hasnot been necessary. He
would not hesitate to refer a
couple to a psychiatrist if he
thought psychiatric counseling
necessary. Also, the operation
might be denied to very young
men who have not had any
children.
Although state law does not
require consent of the spouse
when a married man is seeking the

operation, the San Mateo clinic
will not perform the operation
without a wife's consent. All files
are kept confidential.
Since the San Mateo clinic
began handling vasectomies in
April of this year, they have
counseled about 150 couples, and
performed 61 vasectomies. "Many

couples change their minds" says
Sheeran, "when they are in
counseling. Although there is a
small chance of the operation
being reversed, the process is
complicated, requires surgery, a
stay in the hospital, and is not
certain to work. We advise them
that the operation is final."


UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL?—Not really. Vasectomies are being
offered to more and more men as a quick and painless form of birth
controL As seen in this diagram, the vas deferens is cut and tied in a

U.S. in the last year alone, more
than the total amount for the five
years before that. Advocates call
vasectomy a sure birth-control
method and emphasize that it in
no way restricts sexual activity.
The operation itself is fairly
simple. A small incision is made in
each side of the scrotum, so that

the vas deferens (the small tubes
through which sperm travel), can
be lifted out, cut, and tied off.
This blocks the passage of sperm.
The testicle continues to produce
sperm, but it is absorbed by the
body.
Usually, a vasectomy can be
done in a doctor's office under
local anesthesia. The man can
return home afterward, and may
be back in action within a few
days. Complications are rare, and
are minor when they occur.
Men are not sterile immediately
after the operation, and it may
take up to six weeks for the
remaining sperm in the testicles to
be eliminated. A sperm count is
made after a few weeks to be sure
that no sperm remain in the
sexual fluid, and some other form

of contraception must be used
until then.
Though men become sterile
soon after the operation, a vasec
tomy has no effect on a man's
sexual drive, and in fact many
men enjoy sexual intercourse
more once the fear of an unwant
ed pregnancy has been removed.
Pat Sheeran, the Executive Direc
tor of the San Mateo Planned
Parenthood Association, reports
that many men's wives are "jubi
lant" about their husbands' having
had the operation, because they
no longer have to worry about
birth control methods.
The simple procedure costs less
than $150 through a private
physician. But San Mateo's Plan
ned Parenthood clinic, with the
help of a federal grant, is the
state's first clinic offering free
vasectomies to men with low
incomes. The operations are per
formed once a week, on Thursday
night, by a doctor from the
Stanford Medical Center. Four
vasectomies are performed each
Thursday.
To be elligible for a vasectomy
at the San Mateo clinic, a man
must have an income of less than
$7000 and have no insurance plan
which would cover the cost of the
operation. The clinic arranges the
operation for men who cannot

afford the high cost of private
medical care.
Before a man is placed on the
two-month waiting list for the
operation, counseling is done at
the San I\4teo clinic to be sure
that the operation is in the best
interest of the man and his wife.
Sheeran, who is a qualified
counselor, says the average couple
coming to the clinic is . . white,
and Catholic, with two children.
The men are usually around
thirty, and the wives a little
younger."
Sheeran said that he might
deny some couples the operation,
if there were a valid reason, but so
far it hasnot been necessary. He
would not hesitate to refer a
couple to a psychiatrist if he
thought psychiatric counseling
necessary. Also, the operation
might be denied to very young
men who have not had any
children.
Although state law does not
require consent of the spouse
when a married man is seeking the

operation, the San Mateo clinic
will not perform the operation
without a wife's consent. All files
are kept confidential.
Since the San Mateo clinic
began handling vasectomies in
April of this year, they have
counseled about 150 couples, and
performed 61 vasectomies. "Many

couples change their minds" says
Sheeran, "when they are in
counseling. Although there is a
small chance of the operation
being reversed, the process is
complicated, requires surgery, a
stay in the hospital, and is not
certain to work. We advise them
that the operation is final."


UNKINDEST CUT OF ALL?—Not really. Vasectomies are being
offered to more and more men as a quick and painless form of birth
controL As seen in this diagram, the vas deferens is cut and tied in a
simple and safe operation performed in the doctor's office.
"Performing a vasectomy is
about as easy as removing a wart"
says Stanford doctor John Sands.
"You could take a bum off the
streets and teach him how to
perform the operation within a
few weeks."
Vasectomy, a simple, short
operation to sterilize men, is
