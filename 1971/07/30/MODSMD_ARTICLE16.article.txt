# Med Clinic Set Up In San Jose
## 
### DICK GEIKIE 
Stanford medical students have
launched a community health center in
an impoverished area of San Jose.
Initiated at the close of spring semester
by third year Stanford medical student
Chris Murlas and several of his peers,
Gardner Family Health Center serves a
community of 17,000 which has no
local doctor.
Designed to eventually be a full
service dental, optimetric, and medical
facility, the current center at the
Sacred Heart Elementary School, 310
Edwards Ave., San Jose, operates as a
first line treatment clinic with severe or
emergency cases being taken to the
Valley Medical Center. "We are open
Monday through Thursday evenings
from 6:30 to 10:30," said Phil Smith
Stanford pre-med student, "and pro
vide transportation and child care to
make it as easy as possible for working
people of the area to visit the clinic. We
hope to expand the service to include
Friday nights and Saturday mornings at
some future date."
Starting with initial investment of
$200 and a phenomenal amount of
manual dexterity the ten Stanford
medical and pre-medical students built
examining rooms, offices and a labora
tory to transform the ground floor of
the one time elementary school into an
effective neighborhood clinic.
With donations from Stanford, Val
ley Medical Center, O'Conner Hospital,
pharmaceutical companies and private
physicians, of examining equipment,
tables, scales, lights, sterile bandaging
and nearly $15,000 worth of drugs, the
students are dispensing more medical
attention to the areas inhabitants than
they have seen in years. "Gardner's
population consists of 53 percent
young Chicano and 40 percent old
Italian families with nearly half making
less than $4,000 per year and without a
car," added Smith.
First year medical student Fernando
Mendoza emphasized, "One of the
greatest problems is the language
barrier. We are trying to get community
people to work as translators for the

doctors during examinations. This is
also a great opportunity for Chicano
youths to get involved in the health
field. We need many more Chicano
doctors and nurses."
Chris Murlas, Acting Coordinator
said, "We want to become a self-suf-

ficient community clinic with funds
coming from patient billing, commen
serate with their ability to pay,
Medicare and Medical benefits. We
don't want Office of Economic Oppor
tunity funding because of all the strings
attached."

doctors during examinations. This is
also a great opportunity for Chicano
youths to get involved in the health
field. We need many more Chicano
doctors and nurses."

PEOPLE'S MEDICINE—HeaIth care delivery for the poor is being realized by
a group of Stanford medical students in the community of Gardner. The
Gardner Family Health Center now serves the 17,000 residents of the San
Jose neighborhood, where family income is generally less than $4,000 per
year.
Stanford medical students have
launched a community health center in
an impoverished area of San Jose.
Initiated at the close of spring semester
by third year Stanford medical student
Chris Murlas and several of his peers,
Gardner Family Health Center serves a
community of 17,000 which has no
local doctor.
Designed to eventually be a full
service dental, optimetric, and medical
facility, the current center at the
Sacred Heart Elementary School, 310
Edwards Ave., San Jose, operates as a
first line treatment clinic with severe or
emergency cases being taken to the
Valley Medical Center. "We are open
Monday through Thursday evenings
from 6:30 to 10:30," said Phil Smith
Stanford pre-med student, "and pro
vide transportation and child care to
make it as easy as possible for working
people of the area to visit the clinic. We
hope to expand the service to include
Friday nights and Saturday mornings at
some future date."
Starting with initial investment of
$200 and a phenomenal amount of
manual dexterity the ten Stanford
medical and pre-medical students built
examining rooms, offices and a labora
tory to transform the ground floor of
the one time elementary school into an
effective neighborhood clinic.
With donations from Stanford, Val
ley Medical Center, O'Conner Hospital,
pharmaceutical companies and private
physicians, of examining equipment,
tables, scales, lights, sterile bandaging
and nearly $15,000 worth of drugs, the
students are dispensing more medical
attention to the areas inhabitants than
they have seen in years. "Gardner's
population consists of 53 percent
young Chicano and 40 percent old
Italian families with nearly half making
less than $4,000 per year and without a
car," added Smith.
First year medical student Fernando
Mendoza emphasized, "One of the
greatest problems is the language
barrier. We are trying to get community
people to work as translators for the

doctors during examinations. This is
also a great opportunity for Chicano
youths to get involved in the health
field. We need many more Chicano
doctors and nurses."
