# Chinese: All Day Study
## 
### 
Ever spent eight hours a day on one
of your courses? That's about par for
the 50 students taking an "intensive"
Asian language at Stanford this sum
mer. Their goal: to learn a year of
Chinese or Japanese in ten weeks.
Corina Winchester, a first-year
Chinese student explained her daily
routine: After four hours of class in the
morning, she does some laboratory
work and takes a test. It is "highly
recommended" that she attend another
hour of lab later in the afternoon. After
dinner, she spends most of her evening
in Arroyo House studying and preparing
for the next day's class.
Obviously, students in the ten-week
intensive program have to be extra
ordinarily motivated. Lumi Nakatani, a
high-schooler from Tokyo who's in
first-year Chinese, claimed that of the
20 in her class, only several have
dropped out, and "three or four are
behind."
The perils of getting behind in a
15-unit, hyperpressurized language
course are told by one student, who
declined to be identified. Now having
to drop the course, he'd discovered
how hard it was only after it began: "I
was sick two days and found it
impossible to catch up ... if you miss
any of the course, you're lost." The
first-year course was labelled "Chinese
I-through-whatever," he said ruefully.
The Asian language students are all
housed in Arroyo, where they can
reinforce each other. Foreign students
studying intensive English, many of
them Japanece, also live in Arroyo, and
the two groups interact, giving and
getting help in turn.
A fourth-year Chinese student from
Princeton, Ginny Kansky, added that
the student-linguists had developed a
"close-knit" community, but that "it's
not too popular a place for parties,"
with the 50-hour study weeks most
kids carry.
She is studying "Classical Chinese,"
and hopes to study Chinese law. "Most
of the people here aren't motivated for
specific careers involving the language,"

she noted, "but this is still probably the
best school in the country for learning
the language." Kansky pointed out that
the professors at Stanford were "better
than those I studied under in Taiwan."
It costs less, incidentally, to study in
Taiwan, even with transportation, than
in Stanford's summer program.
Yin Chuang, professor of second
year Chinese, noted that intensive
language courses "were a Western idea,
very conscious of time . . . they pro
bably wouldn't be popular in the
Orient, outside of'Westernized'cities."
According to Chuang, the majority
of students are not studying for a
career; of those who are, Howard
Yamaguchi hopes to better his chances
to get a civil engineering job in Asia,
Bailey wants to move to Japan, Kansky
can use Chinese in law or journalism.

Nakatani is typical of those others
who'd like to travel or understand
Eastern culture better. Curiously,
knowing Japaner*, as she and several
others do, can be a handicap when
you're out to learn Chinese. "It's easy,"
she remarked, "to sometimes get the
characters—there are over 3,ooo—mixed
up in the two languages. Knowing
Japanese is no real help."
None of the students voiced any
hopes that President Nixon's proposed
China visit would open doors for study
or careers on the mainland. Professor
Chuang, however, said that Asian
languages are becoming more popular,
with some Stanford courses possibly
doubled next year. The Nixon break
through, he commented, may en
courage even more people to enter the
field.

Nakatani is typical of those others
who'd like to travel or understand
Eastern culture better. Curiously,
knowing Japaner*, as she and several
others do, can be a handicap when
you're out to learn Chinese. "It's easy,"
she remarked, "to sometimes get the
characters—there are over 3,ooo—mixed
up in the two languages. Knowing
Japanese is no real help."
None of the students voiced any
hopes that President Nixon's proposed
China visit would open doors for study
or careers on the mainland. Professor
Chuang, however, said that Asian
languages are becoming more popular,
with some Stanford courses possibly
doubled next year. The Nixon break
through, he commented, may en
courage even more people to enter the
field.
Ever spent eight hours a day on one
of your courses? That's about par for
the 50 students taking an "intensive"
Asian language at Stanford this sum
mer. Their goal: to learn a year of
Chinese or Japanese in ten weeks.
Corina Winchester, a first-year
Chinese student explained her daily
routine: After four hours of class in the
morning, she does some laboratory
work and takes a test. It is "highly
recommended" that she attend another
hour of lab later in the afternoon. After
dinner, she spends most of her evening
in Arroyo House studying and preparing
for the next day's class.
Obviously, students in the ten-week
intensive program have to be extra
ordinarily motivated. Lumi Nakatani, a
high-schooler from Tokyo who's in
first-year Chinese, claimed that of the
20 in her class, only several have
dropped out, and "three or four are
behind."
The perils of getting behind in a
15-unit, hyperpressurized language
course are told by one student, who
declined to be identified. Now having
to drop the course, he'd discovered
how hard it was only after it began: "I
was sick two days and found it
impossible to catch up ... if you miss
any of the course, you're lost." The
first-year course was labelled "Chinese
I-through-whatever," he said ruefully.
The Asian language students are all
housed in Arroyo, where they can
reinforce each other. Foreign students
studying intensive English, many of
them Japanece, also live in Arroyo, and
the two groups interact, giving and
getting help in turn.
A fourth-year Chinese student from
Princeton, Ginny Kansky, added that
the student-linguists had developed a
"close-knit" community, but that "it's
not too popular a place for parties,"
with the 50-hour study weeks most
kids carry.
She is studying "Classical Chinese,"
and hopes to study Chinese law. "Most
of the people here aren't motivated for
specific careers involving the language,"

she noted, "but this is still probably the
best school in the country for learning
the language." Kansky pointed out that
the professors at Stanford were "better
than those I studied under in Taiwan."
It costs less, incidentally, to study in
Taiwan, even with transportation, than
in Stanford's summer program.
Yin Chuang, professor of second
year Chinese, noted that intensive
language courses "were a Western idea,
very conscious of time . . . they pro
bably wouldn't be popular in the
Orient, outside of'Westernized'cities."
According to Chuang, the majority
of students are not studying for a
career; of those who are, Howard
