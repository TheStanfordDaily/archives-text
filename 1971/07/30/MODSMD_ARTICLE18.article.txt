BILL DIES
Sponsors have withdrawn a bill in
the state assembly to give more power
to Stanford police, the proposal's
opponents said. The bill has not been
forwarded to its next committee step,
effectively killing it, according to Santa
Clara Sheriffs Sgt. Don Tamm.
Tamm said his department and
Stanford are now working on a
substitute working-relationship be
tween the two departments. He said the
new system would involve deputizing
Stanford's security patrolmen.
It has also been learned that the
liberal opposition to the bill in
Sacramento was encouraged by Stan
ford student leaders. Members of the
Council of Presidents worked with
Tamm and urged Assemblyman Willie
Brown to oppose the bill which was
initiated by the University administra
tion.
