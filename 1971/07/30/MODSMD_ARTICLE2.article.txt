# Rich Named Dean Of Med School; Appointment Ends Long Search
## 
### 
Dr. Clayton Rich, an associate dean
at the University of Washington School
of Medicine, has been named Dean of
Stanford's medical school.
Rich's appointment, effective Sept.
1, includes the positions of professor of
medicine and Vice President for Medi
cal Affairs.
The 47-year-old specialist in diseases
of the bone succeeds Acting Dean John
L. Wilson. Wilson has served since Dr.
Robert L. Glaser resigned 11 months
ago to become Vice President of the
Commonwealth Fund in New York.
The selection came after year-long
meetings of a faculty-student search
committee led by the University
President.
Rich, who was associate dean for
research and clinical affairs at the
University of Washington, was visiting
campus when his new job was announc
ed Wednesday. Rich said he and

administrators "had been working to
wards" the appointment for several
months.
The new dean said the challenges of
his new position include financial
problems facing all medical schools. He
explained government support of medi
cal research is no longer increasing at its
traditional rate.
Asked about a violent sit-in at
Stanford Hospital in April, Rich said he
takes the new job aware that "intel
lectual vigor and controversy go hand
in-hand" on modern campuses.
He pointed out that Stanford Medi
cal School "has taken a strong stand on
admission of minority students as a
matter of policy." He said "maintaining
contact with reality" requires special
efforts to recruit minority students.
Rich said medical schools have made
"vast improvement in the last five
years" to reform and update their

curricula. He called Stanford a leader in
that effort.
Medical schools share responsibility
with other institutions for solving the
nation's problems in delivering ade
quate health care, according to Rich.
"It has become apparent in the past
few years that the system in this
country isn't working very well," he
said. "We'll have to devise better ways
of providing proper health care to
everyone, not just a few."
Rich said the nation has made "a
new commitment of the past few years
that medical care is a right and not
something you buy if you have spare
cash." But he conceded the promise is
not yet fulfilled.
Although predicting more public aid
for health care, Rich said, "I hope we
don't end up with one monolithic
government system. That's been so
ineffective in the countries where it's
been tried."
Rich favors extension of public and
prepaid medical clinics, but said the
individual practioner should be main
tained for those who can afford him.
"The classical private patient rela
tionship is a very good, personalized
method of receiving medical care."
