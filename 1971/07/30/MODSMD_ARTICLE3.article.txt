# Prisoners' Reality
## Ex-Con Teaches Psych Course 
### MADELINE NELSON 
"I want to see if I can put people in
front of you who are finks, liars and
rats, who've been totally corrupted,
who are incapable of feeling, to see if
you can sense the fears they have of
being detected... I want you to
perceive the truth of the world around
you as you relate to it." Carlo Prescott,
39 year old black ex-convict, who has
spent 16 of his last 19 years in prisons
is speaking to his students in a summer
seminar he teaches on the "Psychology
of Being Imprisoned."
Sponsored by Dr. Philip Zimbardo of
the Department of Psychology, who
sits in on the course but does not teach
it, and funded under a grant from the
National Institute of Mental Health, the
unique seminar is being enthusiastically
attended by a diverse group of students
who range in backgrounds from a high
school junior to a 50-year-old school
nurse. Scheduled as a twice weekly,
two hour seminar, it usually holds
students for three to five hours.
Prescott, who pulls no punches in his
graphic descriptions of life inside prison

walls, comes across as an articulate and
sensitive man. Often, he urges his
students into discussions of themselves,
their lives, their world, drawing the
relationship to the subject matter of
the course by pointing out that "we all
have our prisons. What I want to do is
refine your perception of the world and
the people in it. . . all of the people."
The idea for the course arose
sometime last spring after a teaching
assistant introduced Prescott, recently
paroled from Vacaville after serving
seven years for armed robbery, to
Zimbardo. Zimbardo, impressed with
what Prescott could contribute to
students, invited him to lecture in a
social psychology course. Later, Zim
bardo was able to arrange funding
which allowed Prescott to teach the
seminar this summer.
Prescott is not trying to teach a
specific set of information, no one
discusses research and results. He is
attempting to make his students find
those things in their lives which help
them break out their own backgrounds
and reach other people whose lives are
seemingly different. "Most other peo

pie haven't been through what I've
been through," Prescott states, "but
they've been hurt, they've been lonely
and they can understand what it means
to be imprisoned."
As part of the course, Prescott talks
openly about his own experiences in
prison, the racism, the brutality, the
homosexuality. Occasionally he invites
other ex-convicts to take part in the
discussions.
One guest told the seminar, "I never
confronted racism in West Oakland, 1
wasn't even aware of it. But I was made
quite aware of it the minute I got into
prison." The best jobs, the jobs which
can teach useful skills, all go to whites,
Prescott added. Also the shops where
weapons can be made are controlled by
whites. It's a fact of prison life that
"whoever constructs weapons tech
nically controls the prisoners."
Prison officials use the racism and
homosexuality to degrade and control
the prisoners. According to Prescott,
once a prisoner learns that he isn't
really human, he will not object to
anything that is done to him. There is
"no attempt or intent" to change
prisoners in a positive way.
He views prisoners as political people
who have decided that the conventions
and laws of the society do not apply to
them. Since the prisoners, especially
the black and Chicano convicts, did not
have anything to say about the laws,
they do not feel they have to obey
them.
Although he sometimes has to prod
them into being open, Prescott's
students clearly find both their teacher

and his course extremely exciting.
Often the students open up with
Prescott and talk about their ex
periences. Occasionally he will create
conflict to involve their emotions as
well as their minds so they can find the
connections between themselves and
the ex-convicts.
According to one student, "Carlo
comes across as a human being more
than anyone else." And that statement
proves Prescott's belief that people can
break out of their racial, cultural,
religious, ethnic and sexual prisons and
meet as people.
