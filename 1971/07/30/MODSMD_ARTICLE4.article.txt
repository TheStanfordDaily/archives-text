# Billy Graham: 'Jesus Or Devil'
## 
### DAVE SPECTOR 
Commentary
High above second base, a poor
farmer's son has enthralled nearly
200,000 people over a period of a
week. Billy Graham's Northern Califor
nia Crusade, "my most successful one
ever," is now on display at the Oakland
Alameda County Coliseum.
Attacking sexual promiscuity, drugs,
and Devil worship Wednesday night,
Graham said, "American is on the verge
of one of the greatest spiritual regenera
tions in its history."

This crusade is youth oriented;
Graham wears his silver-grey hair over
his collar and says "far out."
The thousands of spiritually starved
lemmings every night represent all
backgrounds. Many bring their Bibles
and search for a passage he quotes as if
their fingers are walking through the
Yellow Pages.
Refined Spiel
Graham's spiel is more refined than
that of a faith healpr. No one shouts
"Heal mfe, Billy; Save me, Billy!"
People drop bills and checks into the
white buckets passed through the
stands.
Selling Jesus like Arthur Godfrey
sells Axion, Graham presents a decision
which everyone "has to make": Jesus
Christ or the Devil.
The choice is repeated and empha
sized; Jesus or the Devil, Jesus or the
Devil, Jesus or the Devil. According to
Graham, "Someday the power of
choice will be gone and you will bow to
Him, but it will be too late because it's
Judgement Day."
Shades of Flip Wilson: "Devil gonna
get you."
This builds until the climax of the
Billy Graham Revue: the Declaration
for Christ. Thousands stream from the
stands onto the baseball infield, tele
vision cameras whir, the 5,000 member
choir sings in the background, and a
BART train travels in the background.
The first people on the field are
ringers. They are Counselors and will
pass out literature. But they serve the
purpose of establishing a herd instinct
which brings more people onto the
field who confess to being sinners.
After Graham signs off the tele
vision, he leads the confessors in prayer
and instructs them in the four points:
n»ad the Bible; prayer; develop a new
attitude toward people; get into the
Church.
The counselors take the names of the

converts and hand them a little red
book (no, not the Thoughts of Mao
Tse-tung). This is a dream political
organization—each counselor is respon
sible for a small group of converts
which lends a personal touch.
Graham's The One
But Graham is the overwhelming
attraction. Pacing the flower bedecked
podium with hand movements that
would put a karate expert to shame, he
delivers the Message with the fervor of
Ralph Williams.
His booming voice echoes three
times over the amplifying system. He
confesses, "1 believe in the Devil and
demons; 60 percent of the American
people believe in the Devil according to

the Gallup Poll." As spiritual advisor to
President Nixon, it is difficult to doubt
the man.
The plea for money is low key. The
only request is for a $100 check.
Books, records, songbooks are on sale
to help spread the Gospel. Graham,
though, is paid a salary and receives
money from his column "My Answer,"
syndicated in over 146 newspapers.
(Money has to come from somewhere
since admission to the Crusade is free.)
As the people slowly file out, the
computer-run scoreboard, usually filled
with CHARGE! and other bits of
baseball lore, is emblazoned with "Jesus
said—l am the way—the truth—the
life John 14:6."

life John 14:6."
Commentary
High above second base, a poor
farmer's son has enthralled nearly
200,000 people over a period of a
week. Billy Graham's Northern Califor
nia Crusade, "my most successful one
ever," is now on display at the Oakland
Alameda County Coliseum.
Attacking sexual promiscuity, drugs,
and Devil worship Wednesday night,
Graham said, "American is on the verge
of one of the greatest spiritual regenera
tions in its history."

This crusade is youth oriented;
Graham wears his silver-grey hair over
his collar and says "far out."
The thousands of spiritually starved
lemmings every night represent all
backgrounds. Many bring their Bibles
and search for a passage he quotes as if
their fingers are walking through the
Yellow Pages.
Refined Spiel
Graham's spiel is more refined than
that of a faith healpr. No one shouts
"Heal mfe, Billy; Save me, Billy!"
People drop bills and checks into the
white buckets passed through the
stands.
Selling Jesus like Arthur Godfrey
sells Axion, Graham presents a decision
which everyone "has to make": Jesus
Christ or the Devil.
The choice is repeated and empha
sized; Jesus or the Devil, Jesus or the
Devil, Jesus or the Devil. According to
Graham, "Someday the power of
choice will be gone and you will bow to
Him, but it will be too late because it's
Judgement Day."
Shades of Flip Wilson: "Devil gonna
get you."
This builds until the climax of the
Billy Graham Revue: the Declaration
for Christ. Thousands stream from the
stands onto the baseball infield, tele
vision cameras whir, the 5,000 member
choir sings in the background, and a
BART train travels in the background.
The first people on the field are
ringers. They are Counselors and will
pass out literature. But they serve the
purpose of establishing a herd instinct
which brings more people onto the
field who confess to being sinners.
After Graham signs off the tele
vision, he leads the confessors in prayer
and instructs them in the four points:
n»ad the Bible; prayer; develop a new
attitude toward people; get into the
Church.
The counselors take the names of the

converts and hand them a little red
book (no, not the Thoughts of Mao
Tse-tung). This is a dream political
organization—each counselor is respon
sible for a small group of converts
which lends a personal touch.
Graham's The One
But Graham is the overwhelming
attraction. Pacing the flower bedecked
podium with hand movements that
would put a karate expert to shame, he
delivers the Message with the fervor of
Ralph Williams.
His booming voice echoes three
times over the amplifying system. He
confesses, "1 believe in the Devil and
demons; 60 percent of the American
people believe in the Devil according to

the Gallup Poll." As spiritual advisor to
President Nixon, it is difficult to doubt
the man.
The plea for money is low key. The
only request is for a $100 check.
Books, records, songbooks are on sale
to help spread the Gospel. Graham,
though, is paid a salary and receives
money from his column "My Answer,"
syndicated in over 146 newspapers.
(Money has to come from somewhere
since admission to the Crusade is free.)
As the people slowly file out, the
computer-run scoreboard, usually filled
with CHARGE! and other bits of
baseball lore, is emblazoned with "Jesus
said—l am the way—the truth—the
life John 14:6."
