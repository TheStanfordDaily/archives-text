Jerry Carter
I've long considered the newspaper world to be
one of the bastions of the "It's a man's world"
philosophy. It certainly meets all the requirements.
It is the kind of profession where an aggressive,
self-assured style of work is not only rewarded, it is
demanded.
And as one would suspect, the most successful
and powerful members of the press have tradition
ally been men.
Of course, the newspaper world, like the rest of
the world, is changing, and whether it is still a
"man's world" is open to debate.
Debate Begins
I opened up the question of male chauvinism to
colleagues (nearly all men this summer) and ran into
an'interesting problem. The men in the office are
willing to accept that there may be some chauvinism
in the operation of the Daily, but they cannot see
where.
I think most of the men feel that the newspaper
atmosphere here is probably the least chauvinist
place around. I am told that "any woman who
wants to make it on the Daily, can." (Interesting
way of putting that, boys.) I was quoted the fact

'The only alliance I want to make with Women's
Lib is in bed. 9 -abbie hoffman

that of the last four editors of the Daily, two have
been women.
It is just difficult in the extreme for the men here
(or in any business situation) to see just how this
kind of atmosphere oppresses women.
To begin with it is a "man's world" simply in
terms of ratio: men outnumber women four or five
to one. It is a rare freshman woman who can walk
into the Daily office on any afternoon and feel
comfortable around a room full of worldly
upperclassmen clanishly bullshitting about how to
better run the world. Women are just generally
excluded from this activity.
Men's Rights
Now, I'm not saying that I don't think men have
any right to activities, conversations, or entertain
ment that excludes women; on the contrary, I think
they have a perfect right to it. I'm just saying that
when there is no alternative—nothing a new woman
can feel comfortable with, then she is necessarily
discouraged from working there.
It is important to note, too, that 90 percent of
the time spent in the office is spent on bullshit of
one kind or another, the other 10 percent of the
time is spent trying to make up for all the time
wasted, usually meaning everyone yelling at the top
of their voices. (Very masculine, you know.)
When a woman walks into the Daily office (it gets
to be a rarer occurence all the time) she is wither
immediately or eventually "checked out" by every
man in the room.
If she is nothing out of the ordinary she is
allowed to go on her way, and the men make a

mental note to deal with the "chickie" at some
future time.
So, the woman sits in a chair in the middle of the
room all alone, and then on her way she goes,
usually right out the door.
Rest of Time
The other 10 percent of the time when we are
actually working is even harder on women. It is hard
on everybody, no question about it, but it is
particularly hard on women.
It is really difficult for a beginning woman staffer
to bring in a story she has written and stand by her
judgement that it is a well-written piece, and also be
able to defend her opinion, loudly if necessary, to
one of the senior writers.
New staffers in general and women in particular
often wish they could find a way to get out of the
whole commitment.
As a woman you are conditioned to believe that a
man's opinion is more valuable than yours, simply
because he is a man. Men are somehow supposed to
be more rational that women in general, simply
because of some primate heritage or another.
As a woman you may fight that notion for a
while, but depending on how you were brought up,
you eventually start to have some doubts yourself.
When people expect you to be less rational, you
start to behave that way.
Conditioning
Women are conditioned from childhood to
believe this. As John Stuart Mill wrote in his essay
on the subjection of women: "All women are

brought up from the very earliest years in the belief
that their ideal of character is the very opposite to
that of men; not self-will, and government by
self-control, but submission, and yielding to the
control of others."
Men, and women too, would find this less hard
to accept as true if they examined the values women
are taught as children. As little girls we are
encouraged to play with dolls, toy stoves, and small
carpetsweepers, while our brothers play with toy
rocketships, science kits, and mathematical games.
The image of ourselves in textbooks which we are
supposed to identify with is that of a helpmate, an
onlooker, an observer of male activities. "Look,
Jane, look! See Dick run and jump! Admire him!"
It is no wonder that women are rarely in positions
of authority anywhere in the world, let alone the
Daily. True, two women have been editors, but on
an all around scale we are going from a high of two
women in positions of authority this spring, to no
women in those positions this fall.
All Oppressed
I'm not saying that it's some sort of plot by all
the "male chauvinist pigs" trying to enslave half of
humanity. Men are as trapped by this system as
women are. (The men in the office get tired of
looking at each other's faces after too long.)
So, what to do. Well, to take care of the 90
percent of the time, I think there should be more
women on the staff so that when a new women
staffer walks in, it won't be to a room full of men
who in one way or another intimidate her.

way of putting that, boys.) I was quoted the fact

'The only alliance I want to make with Women's
Lib is in bed. 9 -abbie hoffman

that of the last four editors of the Daily, two have
been women.
It is just difficult in the extreme for the men here
(or in any business situation) to see just how this
kind of atmosphere oppresses women.
To begin with it is a "man's world" simply in
terms of ratio: men outnumber women four or five
to one. It is a rare freshman woman who can walk
into the Daily office on any afternoon and feel
comfortable around a room full of worldly
upperclassmen clanishly bullshitting about how to
better run the world. Women are just generally
excluded from this activity.
Men's Rights
Now, I'm not saying that I don't think men have
any right to activities, conversations, or entertain
ment that excludes women; on the contrary, I think
they have a perfect right to it. I'm just saying that
when there is no alternative—nothing a new woman
can feel comfortable with, then she is necessarily
discouraged from working there.
It is important to note, too, that 90 percent of
the time spent in the office is spent on bullshit of
one kind or another, the other 10 percent of the
time is spent trying to make up for all the time
wasted, usually meaning everyone yelling at the top
of their voices. (Very masculine, you know.)
When a woman walks into the Daily office (it gets
to be a rarer occurence all the time) she is wither
immediately or eventually "checked out" by every
man in the room.
If she is nothing out of the ordinary she is
allowed to go on her way, and the men make a

mental note to deal with the "chickie" at some
future time.
So, the woman sits in a chair in the middle of the
room all alone, and then on her way she goes,
usually right out the door.
Rest of Time
The other 10 percent of the time when we are
actually working is even harder on women. It is hard
on everybody, no question about it, but it is
particularly hard on women.
It is really difficult for a beginning woman staffer
to bring in a story she has written and stand by her
judgement that it is a well-written piece, and also be
able to defend her opinion, loudly if necessary, to
one of the senior writers.
New staffers in general and women in particular
often wish they could find a way to get out of the
whole commitment.
As a woman you are conditioned to believe that a
man's opinion is more valuable than yours, simply
because he is a man. Men are somehow supposed to
be more rational that women in general, simply
because of some primate heritage or another.
As a woman you may fight that notion for a
while, but depending on how you were brought up,
you eventually start to have some doubts yourself.
When people expect you to be less rational, you
start to behave that way.
Conditioning
Women are conditioned from childhood to
believe this. As John Stuart Mill wrote in his essay
on the subjection of women: "All women are

brought up from the very earliest years in the belief
that their ideal of character is the very opposite to
that of men; not self-will, and government by
self-control, but submission, and yielding to the
control of others."
Men, and women too, would find this less hard
to accept as true if they examined the values women
are taught as children. As little girls we are
encouraged to play with dolls, toy stoves, and small
carpetsweepers, while our brothers play with toy
rocketships, science kits, and mathematical games.
The image of ourselves in textbooks which we are
supposed to identify with is that of a helpmate, an
onlooker, an observer of male activities. "Look,
Jane, look! See Dick run and jump! Admire him!"
It is no wonder that women are rarely in positions
of authority anywhere in the world, let alone the
Daily. True, two women have been editors, but on
an all around scale we are going from a high of two
women in positions of authority this spring, to no
women in those positions this fall.
All Oppressed
I'm not saying that it's some sort of plot by all
the "male chauvinist pigs" trying to enslave half of
humanity. Men are as trapped by this system as
women are. (The men in the office get tired of
looking at each other's faces after too long.)
So, what to do. Well, to take care of the 90
percent of the time, I think there should be more
women on the staff so that when a new women
staffer walks in, it won't be to a room full of men
who in one way or another intimidate her.

I've long considered the newspaper world to be

of their voices. (Very masculine, you know.)
When a woman walks into the Daily office (it gets
to be a rarer occurence all the time) she is wither
immediately or eventually "checked out" by every
man in the room.
If she is nothing out of the ordinary she is
allowed to go on her way, and the men make a

mental note to deal with the "chickie" at some
future time.
So, the woman sits in a chair in the middle of the
room all alone, and then on her way she goes,
usually right out the door.
Rest of Time
The other 10 percent of the time when we are
actually working is even harder on women. It is hard
on everybody, no question about it, but it is
particularly hard on women.
It is really difficult for a beginning woman staffer
to bring in a story she has written and stand by her
judgement that it is a well-written piece, and also be
able to defend her opinion, loudly if necessary, to
one of the senior writers.
New staffers in general and women in particular
often wish they could find a way to get out of the
whole commitment.
As a woman you are conditioned to believe that a
man's opinion is more valuable than yours, simply
because he is a man. Men are somehow supposed to
be more rational that women in general, simply
because of some primate heritage or another.
As a woman you may fight that notion for a
while, but depending on how you were brought up,
you eventually start to have some doubts yourself.
When people expect you to be less rational, you
start to behave that way.
Conditioning
Women are conditioned from childhood to
believe this. As John Stuart Mill wrote in his essay
on the subjection of women: "All women are

brought up from the very earliest years in the belief
that their ideal of character is the very opposite to
that of men; not self-will, and government by
self-control, but submission, and yielding to the
control of others."
Men, and women too, would find this less hard
to accept as true if they examined the values women
are taught as children. As little girls we are
encouraged to play with dolls, toy stoves, and small
carpetsweepers, while our brothers play with toy
rocketships, science kits, and mathematical games.
The image of ourselves in textbooks which we are
supposed to identify with is that of a helpmate, an
onlooker, an observer of male activities. "Look,
Jane, look! See Dick run and jump! Admire him!"
It is no wonder that women are rarely in positions
of authority anywhere in the world, let alone the
Daily. True, two women have been editors, but on
an all around scale we are going from a high of two
women in positions of authority this spring, to no
women in those positions this fall.
All Oppressed
I'm not saying that it's some sort of plot by all
the "male chauvinist pigs" trying to enslave half of
humanity. Men are as trapped by this system as
women are. (The men in the office get tired of
looking at each other's faces after too long.)
So, what to do. Well, to take care of the 90
percent of the time, I think there should be more
women on the staff so that when a new women
staffer walks in, it won't be to a room full of men
who in one way or another intimidate her.

Her vocational role was to be second in

Genesis
A Woman: an animal that can cook.
"/ think a woman ought to be elected to public
office. They have made such a mess of things raising
so many sorry men. Either they've got to raise
better men, or take over the government. "
Jerry Carter
I've long considered the newspaper world to be
one of the bastions of the "It's a man's world"
philosophy. It certainly meets all the requirements.
It is the kind of profession where an aggressive,
self-assured style of work is not only rewarded, it is
demanded.
And as one would suspect, the most successful
and powerful members of the press have tradition
ally been men.
Of course, the newspaper world, like the rest of
the world, is changing, and whether it is still a
"man's world" is open to debate.
Debate Begins
I opened up the question of male chauvinism to
colleagues (nearly all men this summer) and ran into
an'interesting problem. The men in the office are
willing to accept that there may be some chauvinism
in the operation of the Daily, but they cannot see
where.
I think most of the men feel that the newspaper
atmosphere here is probably the least chauvinist
place around. I am told that "any woman who
wants to make it on the Daily, can." (Interesting
way of putting that, boys.) I was quoted the fact

'The only alliance I want to make with Women's
Lib is in bed. 9 -abbie hoffman

that of the last four editors of the Daily, two have
been women.
It is just difficult in the extreme for the men here
(or in any business situation) to see just how this
kind of atmosphere oppresses women.
To begin with it is a "man's world" simply in
terms of ratio: men outnumber women four or five
to one. It is a rare freshman woman who can walk
into the Daily office on any afternoon and feel
comfortable around a room full of worldly
upperclassmen clanishly bullshitting about how to
better run the world. Women are just generally
excluded from this activity.
Men's Rights
Now, I'm not saying that I don't think men have
any right to activities, conversations, or entertain
ment that excludes women; on the contrary, I think
they have a perfect right to it. I'm just saying that
when there is no alternative—nothing a new woman
can feel comfortable with, then she is necessarily
discouraged from working there.
It is important to note, too, that 90 percent of
the time spent in the office is spent on bullshit of
one kind or another, the other 10 percent of the
time is spent trying to make up for all the time
wasted, usually meaning everyone yelling at the top
of their voices. (Very masculine, you know.)
