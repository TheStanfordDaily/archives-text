## Roots Of Women's Rights 
### 
miller and gerling

The phenomenon of the cur
rent women's liberation move
ment is a result of a cultural lag
due to the imbalance between
technology, sociology, and ideolo
gy. When these three factors
complement each other, a stable
society exists, but when anyone
evolves faster than others, a
readjustment becomes necessary if
the culture is to survive in its
altered form. Women's liberation
is part of that readjustment.
In the past, it was reasonable
for women to be tied to the home
for two reasons. First, in a world
of high infant mortality and short
life-spans, it was adaptive for all
women to produce as many
children as possible.
Society was structured to pro
mote the raising of children by
emphasizing the importance of
the family (since a woman who is
frequently pregnant or nursing is
less than able to fend for herself,
and the long maturation period of
human children requires a stable
nurturant environment—hence
marriage) and ideology reinforced
the vision of woman as Divine
Mother in both pre- and post-
Christian cultures.
Second, when women's lives
involved multiple pregnancies and
numbers of small children, it was
efficient for them to take the
major responsibility for childrear
ing as well. The multiple tasks of
maintenance of the home and
family, washing, cooking, clean
ing, sewing, devolved upon them
almost automatically.
Technology's Effects
With the Industrial Revolution,
men found it more economic to
abandon a life style based on the
cultivation of a few acres and
found an increased separation
between their work and their
home life. The great majority of
women, however, remained pri
marily wives and mothers, and
social and ideological patterns
evolved in an agrarian society
were still functional.
Within this century, the acceler
ating pace of technology began to
outstrip traditional society and
ideology drastically. One area of

technological advance has been in
medical knowledge. Decreases in
infant mortality and increases in
life-span make high fertility less of
a positive value in preserving the
species, and may even be detri
mental to its continued survival.
Also, the development of effective
techniques of birth control makes
it possible for women to control
their own biology. Freed from the
constraints of frequent childbear
ing, many women can begin to see
themselves in roles other than that
of mother.
Technology has altered the
productive base of society as well.
An increased availability of and
demand for consumer goods
brought women into the work
force, a move which was greatly
accelerated by the labor shortage
during WW 11.
After a short post-war depres
sion in the number of employed
women, an increasing percentage
of women began to enter the
labor force. In 1968, 29.2 million
women made up 37 percent of the
working population. About one
third of these women had children
under 18 years of age, and
approximately two million of
them had children less than three
years of age.
Nevertheless, women are still
expected to assume the major
responsibility for the care of
home and children. The average
working man has one job, but
many worKing women have two.
Wives vs Workers
This discrepancy between the
fact of women as workers and the
ideological and social perception
of women as wives and mothers
contributes to the channeling of
women into low-paying, low
prestige jobs. A woman whose
husband makes no contribution to
housework and child care has
neither time nor energy to ad
vance her career.
A girl who is brought up to
believe that her primary role in
life is that of wife and mother
(despite the fact that most women
in this society bear their last child
around the age of 30 and have a
life expectancy of another 34

years) is less inclined to educate
herself in preparation for com
petitive work. Yet half of all
women between the ages of 35
and 54 were working in 1968, and
the commonest cause for taking a
job is economic necessity.
This contradiction between the
changes brought about by tech
nology, the facts that many
women work outside the home,
that women can now control their
own fertility, that unchecked
reproduction is potentially disas
trous to the species, and the
still-prevalent thesis that a wom
an's highest destiny is in marriage
and motherhood results in a waste
and misuse of women's talents.
The women's liberation move
ment is an attempt to bring the
social structure into line with the
new realities of existence. This
involves changes in modes of
thought and action which have
developed over thousands of years
and is, predictably, an extra
ordinarily difficult struggle.
Differing Priorities
Some of the apparent divisive
ness which appears in the wom
en's movement arises from the
multiple tasks facing us and the
question of priorities. For women
under economic pressure, especial-

ly women with children, better
pay and improved child care are
the important goals. For women
who have some financial security,
the opportunity to express them
selves as persons rather than as
"wives" or "women" takes on
importance. For women with
professional aspirations, access to
training, opportunity to work,
and recognition for achievement
are vital.
For women who recognize that
control of their own bodies is
basic to control of their lives,
abortion, birth control, and self
defense are burning issues. Women
who view the problems as arising
from the rigidity of society
demand an increased acceptance
of human variation, a society
which can accommodate a variety
of life styles.
None of these goals are mutual
ly exclusive; all are essential to the
development of a new and balanc
ed society. We would hope that
each individual would set her or
his own priorities and work with
us in achieving this end.

ideology drastically. One area of

technological advance has been in
medical knowledge. Decreases in
infant mortality and increases in
life-span make high fertility less of
a positive value in preserving the
species, and may even be detri
mental to its continued survival.
Also, the development of effective
techniques of birth control makes
it possible for women to control
their own biology. Freed from the
constraints of frequent childbear
ing, many women can begin to see
themselves in roles other than that
of mother.
Technology has altered the
productive base of society as well.
An increased availability of and
demand for consumer goods
brought women into the work
force, a move which was greatly
accelerated by the labor shortage
during WW 11.
After a short post-war depres
sion in the number of employed
women, an increasing percentage
of women began to enter the
labor force. In 1968, 29.2 million
women made up 37 percent of the
working population. About one
third of these women had children
under 18 years of age, and
approximately two million of
them had children less than three
years of age.
Nevertheless, women are still
expected to assume the major
responsibility for the care of
home and children. The average
working man has one job, but
many worKing women have two.
Wives vs Workers
This discrepancy between the
fact of women as workers and the
ideological and social perception
of women as wives and mothers
contributes to the channeling of
women into low-paying, low
prestige jobs. A woman whose
husband makes no contribution to
housework and child care has
neither time nor energy to ad
vance her career.
A girl who is brought up to
believe that her primary role in
life is that of wife and mother
(despite the fact that most women
in this society bear their last child
around the age of 30 and have a
life expectancy of another 34

years) is less inclined to educate
herself in preparation for com
petitive work. Yet half of all
women between the ages of 35
and 54 were working in 1968, and
the commonest cause for taking a
job is economic necessity.
This contradiction between the
changes brought about by tech
nology, the facts that many
women work outside the home,
that women can now control their
own fertility, that unchecked
reproduction is potentially disas
trous to the species, and the
still-prevalent thesis that a wom
an's highest destiny is in marriage
and motherhood results in a waste
and misuse of women's talents.
The women's liberation move
ment is an attempt to bring the
social structure into line with the
new realities of existence. This
involves changes in modes of
thought and action which have
developed over thousands of years
and is, predictably, an extra
ordinarily difficult struggle.
Differing Priorities
Some of the apparent divisive
ness which appears in the wom
en's movement arises from the
multiple tasks facing us and the
question of priorities. For women
under economic pressure, especial-

ly women with children, better
pay and improved child care are
the important goals. For women
who have some financial security,
the opportunity to express them
selves as persons rather than as
"wives" or "women" takes on
importance. For women with
professional aspirations, access to
training, opportunity to work,
and recognition for achievement
are vital.
For women who recognize that
control of their own bodies is
basic to control of their lives,
abortion, birth control, and self
defense are burning issues. Women
who view the problems as arising
from the rigidity of society
demand an increased acceptance
of human variation, a society
which can accommodate a variety
of life styles.
None of these goals are mutual
ly exclusive; all are essential to the
development of a new and balanc
ed society. We would hope that
each individual would set her or
his own priorities and work with
us in achieving this end.

The phenomenon of the cur
rent women's liberation move
ment is a result of a cultural lag
due to the imbalance between
technology, sociology, and ideolo
gy. When these three factors
complement each other, a stable
society exists, but when anyone
evolves faster than others, a
readjustment becomes necessary if
the culture is to survive in its
altered form. Women's liberation
is part of that readjustment.
In the past, it was reasonable
for women to be tied to the home
for two reasons. First, in a world
of high infant mortality and short
life-spans, it was adaptive for all
women to produce as many
children as possible.
Society was structured to pro
mote the raising of children by
emphasizing the importance of
the family (since a woman who is
frequently pregnant or nursing is
less than able to fend for herself,
and the long maturation period of
human children requires a stable
nurturant environment—hence
marriage) and ideology reinforced
the vision of woman as Divine
Mother in both pre- and post-
Christian cultures.
Second, when women's lives
involved multiple pregnancies and
numbers of small children, it was
efficient for them to take the
major responsibility for childrear
ing as well. The multiple tasks of
maintenance of the home and
family, washing, cooking, clean
ing, sewing, devolved upon them
almost automatically.
Technology's Effects
With the Industrial Revolution,
men found it more economic to
abandon a life style based on the
cultivation of a few acres and
found an increased separation
between their work and their
home life. The great majority of
women, however, remained pri
marily wives and mothers, and
social and ideological patterns
evolved in an agrarian society
were still functional.
Within this century, the acceler
ating pace of technology began to

around the age of 30 and have a
life expectancy of another 34

years) is less inclined to educate
herself in preparation for com
petitive work. Yet half of all
women between the ages of 35
and 54 were working in 1968, and
the commonest cause for taking a
job is economic necessity.
This contradiction between the
changes brought about by tech
nology, the facts that many
women work outside the home,
that women can now control their
own fertility, that unchecked
reproduction is potentially disas
trous to the species, and the
still-prevalent thesis that a wom
an's highest destiny is in marriage
and motherhood results in a waste
and misuse of women's talents.
The women's liberation move
ment is an attempt to bring the
social structure into line with the
new realities of existence. This
involves changes in modes of
thought and action which have
developed over thousands of years
and is, predictably, an extra
ordinarily difficult struggle.
Differing Priorities
Some of the apparent divisive
ness which appears in the wom
en's movement arises from the
multiple tasks facing us and the
question of priorities. For women
under economic pressure, especial-

ly women with children, better
pay and improved child care are
the important goals. For women
who have some financial security,
the opportunity to express them
selves as persons rather than as
"wives" or "women" takes on
importance. For women with
professional aspirations, access to
training, opportunity to work,
and recognition for achievement
are vital.
For women who recognize that
control of their own bodies is
basic to control of their lives,
abortion, birth control, and self
defense are burning issues. Women
who view the problems as arising
from the rigidity of society
demand an increased acceptance
of human variation, a society
which can accommodate a variety
of life styles.
None of these goals are mutual
ly exclusive; all are essential to the
development of a new and balanc
ed society. We would hope that
each individual would set her or
his own priorities and work with
us in achieving this end.

The phenomenon of the cur
rent women's liberation move
ment is a result of a cultural lag
due to the imbalance between
technology, sociology, and ideolo
gy. When these three factors
complement each other, a stable
society exists, but when anyone
evolves faster than others, a
readjustment becomes necessary if
the culture is to survive in its
altered form. Women's liberation
is part of that readjustment.
In the past, it was reasonable
for women to be tied to the home
for two reasons. First, in a world
of high infant mortality and short
life-spans, it was adaptive for all
women to produce as many
children as possible.
Society was structured to pro
mote the raising of children by
emphasizing the importance of
the family (since a woman who is
frequently pregnant or nursing is
less than able to fend for herself,
and the long maturation period of
human children requires a stable
nurturant environment—hence
marriage) and ideology reinforced
the vision of woman as Divine
Mother in both pre- and post-
Christian cultures.
Second, when women's lives
involved multiple pregnancies and
numbers of small children, it was
efficient for them to take the
major responsibility for childrear
ing as well. The multiple tasks of
maintenance of the home and
family, washing, cooking, clean
ing, sewing, devolved upon them
almost automatically.
Technology's Effects
With the Industrial Revolution,
men found it more economic to
abandon a life style based on the
cultivation of a few acres and
found an increased separation
between their work and their
home life. The great majority of
women, however, remained pri
marily wives and mothers, and
social and ideological patterns
evolved in an agrarian society
were still functional.
Within this century, the acceler
ating pace of technology began to
outstrip traditional society and
ideology drastically. One area of

technological advance has been in
medical knowledge. Decreases in
infant mortality and increases in
life-span make high fertility less of
a positive value in preserving the
species, and may even be detri
mental to its continued survival.
Also, the development of effective
techniques of birth control makes
it possible for women to control
their own biology. Freed from the
constraints of frequent childbear
ing, many women can begin to see
themselves in roles other than that
of mother.
Technology has altered the
productive base of society as well.
An increased availability of and
demand for consumer goods
brought women into the work
force, a move which was greatly
accelerated by the labor shortage
during WW 11.
After a short post-war depres
sion in the number of employed
women, an increasing percentage
of women began to enter the
labor force. In 1968, 29.2 million
women made up 37 percent of the
working population. About one
third of these women had children
under 18 years of age, and
approximately two million of
them had children less than three
years of age.
Nevertheless, women are still
expected to assume the major
responsibility for the care of
home and children. The average
working man has one job, but
many worKing women have two.
Wives vs Workers
This discrepancy between the
fact of women as workers and the
ideological and social perception
of women as wives and mothers
contributes to the channeling of
women into low-paying, low
prestige jobs. A woman whose
husband makes no contribution to
housework and child care has
neither time nor energy to ad
vance her career.
A girl who is brought up to
believe that her primary role in
life is that of wife and mother
(despite the fact that most women
in this society bear their last child
around the age of 30 and have a
life expectancy of another 34

years) is less inclined to educate
herself in preparation for com
petitive work. Yet half of all
