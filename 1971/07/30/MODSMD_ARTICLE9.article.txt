## Women's Liberation Is A Thorny Subject 
### 
steven g. ungar

Well, how much can a guy take? It seems that
even if I don't say anything, I'm going to get in
trouble.
I make no claim to be an expert on either
Women's Liberation or on women. This paper
wasn't my idea. In fact, when I thought about
the thing for a couple of days and realized that
no matter what I said somebody would get mad
at me, I told the Daily's opinions editor to forget
it. She called me a yellow coward, and demanded
to know whether I was "a man or a mouse?"
I speak from a man's perspective. A friend of
mine once said that no man could ever write
about women's problems, because no man could
ever know what it is like to be a woman. I agree.
Since I really haven't given the Women's
Liberation movement the serious study it
deserves, I shall simply meander through some of
the more significant slogans, phrases and
catchalls, and see where it takes me.
Women Always Right
For my Sisters who claim that I am not
capable of writing a coherent paper on the
subject, I confess: I am not. Even if I were, I
wouldn't argue the point. When I was a little boy
my mother told me that a lady is always right.
Personal observation has confirmed this many
times.
So, if you're ready, I'll gird up my loins, you
gird up whatever you've got that needs girding,
and we'll ramble down the thorny path of
Women's Lib.
Women are oppressed—l shall get off on the
right foot by accepting this as obvious. Taken in
the loosest sense of the word, women certainly
are oppressed. Unfortunately, taken in the
loosest sense of the word, so are many other
classes of beings, most of them more sorely so
than women (e.g., blue whales, peregrine falcons,
timber wolves, etc.).
While I sympathize with women who feel they
are being shafted by society, I really can't feel as
sorry for them as for the poor birds who had oil
spilled all over them last winter.
Tough World
I readily concede that in the economic sphere,
women are suffering a gross injustice. Common
sense and decency demand that employment,
pay, the opportunity for advancement, and all

the other concommitants of the business world
not be based on any factor other than job
performance. It is clear that, at this time, women
are not being treated fairly in the labor market.
But taken in the larger sense of the word,
women are no more oppressed by society than
are men. They may be oppressed in different
ways, but not, I believe, more severely.
Everyone bitches. It's a tough world.
Sisterhood is Powerful— Right again! You bet
your bazooms Sisterhood is Powerful. Anytime
you get half the population of the country
agreeing on something, you've got yourself one
hell of a power group. The question is, what are
the realistic chances of getting any large group of
women to act as a bloc?
Very small.
The Democrats would be delighted if they
could get all the Democrats to agree on
something—on anything!
No Agreement
And groups don't have to be all that big to be
powerful. Smaller blocs, such as Jews, Italian-
Americans, Polish-Americans, Ku Klux Klans
men, Communists—any ethnic, political or social
group—potentially has power, if it can only get
all its constituents to act in unison on an issue.
None of the above groups, to my knowledge
(with the exception of the Communist Party 40
years ago) has ever managed to get all of its
members to agree on anything. And each of these
groups includes women as a subset! If the
Communists can't get all women Communists to
agree on something, what are the chances that
any women's group can get all women to agree
on anything?
As I said, very small.
OK, maybe I'm being too restrictive. Women
constitute 53 percent of the population. If you
can get one tenth of these women to act in
unison on some subject, you have a force to
contend with.
'Lib' A Loser?
I maintain that if this should occur, the
present Women's Liberation power structure will
have little or nothing to do with it. Quite plainly,
"Women's Lib" is a loser outside of the big cities
and the college campuses.
To quote Arlene Croce, the editor of "Ballet

Review," in a recent paper in "Commentary"
("Sexism in the Head," Vol. 51, No. 3, March
1971, p. 63): "...Women's Liberation, so
called, is the only movement that has to struggle
full time to pursuade its constituents of their
need to be liberated."
It's true. Look around you at Stanford, at this
campus chock full of self-aware, self-conscious
people. Even here, a sizeable proportion of
women seem to believe that male chauvinism can
be fun.
Middle America
If the movement limps along so badly in a
sophisticated university environment, what must
it be like out on the hustings, where most of
America's women live, married to their lower
middle class blue- or white-collar worker, with
the 3.2 children? How susceptible are these
women to the agrument that they have been
living in a fool's paradise, oppressed, persecuted,
and insulted, chained to a home and a family as
house-slaves?
How would you feel if you struggled through
20 years of married life, raising a family, going to
church on Sunday, God-fearing and loyal to your
husband, and then some cross between a hippie
and a harpie, with a name like Gloria Steinem or
Bella Abzug ("What kind of name is that for an
American—she must be a Jew or a Pollack or
something!") comes along and tells you you've
wasted your life?
How can you build a grass-roots movement
when the leaders of the movement seem to be
lesbians or revolutionaries and scare the hell out
of the grass-roots constituents?
To wrap it up, the movement is becoming
ingrown, with all the decadence usually associat
ed with self-hatred and bitterness. Betty Friedan,
the founder of the National Organization of
Women, just got a divorce, and Ti-Grace
Atkinson has announced that the only way to be
truly liberated is to renounce the oppressor
male and withdraw into an all-female society.
Leadership Failure
That may have some merit, but 1 think an
analysis on the basis of population genetics will
demonstrate that such a society is not likely to
be successful in an evolutionary sense, and is
probably unstable in a psychological sense.

So, while Sisterhood may be Powerful, the
power is not likely to be realized by the present
Women's Lib Establishment. I refer, of course, to
overt power, the kind traditionally exercised by
males, and not to covert power, which women
have always exercised, and probably will
continue to exercise, come hell or high
Liberation.
Women have effectively controlled society
from the sidelines for eons; Sisterhood is
Powerful in the same way that John Ralston is
powerful, as he sits back and watches the players
he controls get their brains beat out to gather his
roses (no offense John—just an illustration).
I don't want to be treated like an object—l'm
with you, lady! I don't want to be treated like an
object either, and I would guess that I'm treated
like an object by the women I know as often as
they are treated like objects by their male
friends. Object-treatment is not sex-specific.
Of course, we are really speaking of two
different phenomena when we talk of women
being treated as objects. First, there is the
individual depersonification mentioned above.
Second, perhaps more galling to some women,
there is the meat parade-dumb blonde syndrome,
personified by "Playboy" and the Miss What-Not
Pageant, in which women are paraded about as
symbols.
Skeptophilia vs Exhibitionism
I have never quite understood the objections
women have to my looking at other women. It
seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.
Psychologists call it skeptophilia, the love of
observing. All evidence indicates that male
human beings have been plagued with this disease
from the beginning of recorded history. Most of
us have learned to live with it.
Women don't seem to get the same thrill from
observing male bodies as men have from
observing females. If there were any sizeable
demand by women for male prostitutes, male
strip teases or male nudie magazines, I'm sure our
great free enterprise system would rise to the
occasion.
Women, on the contrary, seem to derive
pleasure from observing men observing women
(particularly if the subject is themselves, and the

observing isn't too obvious). Perhaps women are
as naturally exhibitionistic as men are skepto
philiac. It wouldn't be the first time the sexes
had complemented each other's behavior.
Individual Considerations
The place for women is in the home —Non
sense. The place for a woman is wherever she can
contribute most to her society and herself. If this
Ls in the home, fine; if it is in business, also fine.
The only sticky point comes with the advent
of young children. I wouldn't want to say
catagorically that women are better endowed to
care for young children than are men, but
biology certainly would suggest it, as would the
habits of most other higher mammals; not to
mention most of the mothers I have known, each
of whom recognizes her husband's incompetence
as clearly as she does her own obligations toward
her baby.
How a mother manages to reconcile her duties
to her family with her desire to get out of the
damned house is a problem that must be solved
by herself, together with her husband. I don't
believe there is any general solution, or any
hard-and-fast rule. How they do it is their
business, none of mine—or yours.
The Women's Lib Pantheon of Heroes—Every
movement needs its scapegoats. Here are some of
the people, who by their work or by their
temperment, have made The Movement possible
by giving it someone to throw things at.
Many of these men are dead. So much the
better. They can't duck.
Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Norman
Mailer, Lionel Tiger, Richard Nixon, Hugh
Hefner, William Rogers, Henry Kissinger ("(
wonder who's Kissinger now, lala"), Casanova,
Sally Stanford, William Shakespeare, Flo Zieg
field, Benjamin Spock, Eugene McCarthy, the US
Navy, and Stokely Carmichael ("the only
position for a woman in SNCC is prone").
Women's Lib makes strange bedfellows.
Women are naturally smarter than men—l used
to think so, but now I'm not so sure any more.
Some of my best friends arc women—As of
yesterday, yes. Now, 1 think I'm in trouble.

Well, how much can a guy take? It seems that
even if I don't say anything, I'm going to get in
trouble.
I make no claim to be an expert on either
Women's Liberation or on women. This paper
wasn't my idea. In fact, when I thought about
the thing for a couple of days and realized that
no matter what I said somebody would get mad
at me, I told the Daily's opinions editor to forget
it. She called me a yellow coward, and demanded
to know whether I was "a man or a mouse?"
I speak from a man's perspective. A friend of
mine once said that no man could ever write
about women's problems, because no man could
ever know what it is like to be a woman. I agree.
Since I really haven't given the Women's
Liberation movement the serious study it
deserves, I shall simply meander through some of
the more significant slogans, phrases and
catchalls, and see where it takes me.
Women Always Right
For my Sisters who claim that I am not
capable of writing a coherent paper on the
subject, I confess: I am not. Even if I were, I
wouldn't argue the point. When I was a little boy
my mother told me that a lady is always right.
Personal observation has confirmed this many
times.
So, if you're ready, I'll gird up my loins, you
gird up whatever you've got that needs girding,
and we'll ramble down the thorny path of
Women's Lib.
Women are oppressed—l shall get off on the
right foot by accepting this as obvious. Taken in
the loosest sense of the word, women certainly
are oppressed. Unfortunately, taken in the
loosest sense of the word, so are many other
classes of beings, most of them more sorely so
than women (e.g., blue whales, peregrine falcons,
timber wolves, etc.).
While I sympathize with women who feel they
are being shafted by society, I really can't feel as
sorry for them as for the poor birds who had oil
spilled all over them last winter.
Tough World
I readily concede that in the economic sphere,
women are suffering a gross injustice. Common
sense and decency demand that employment,
pay, the opportunity for advancement, and all

the other concommitants of the business world
not be based on any factor other than job
performance. It is clear that, at this time, women
are not being treated fairly in the labor market.
But taken in the larger sense of the word,
women are no more oppressed by society than
are men. They may be oppressed in different
ways, but not, I believe, more severely.
Everyone bitches. It's a tough world.
Sisterhood is Powerful— Right again! You bet
your bazooms Sisterhood is Powerful. Anytime
you get half the population of the country
agreeing on something, you've got yourself one
hell of a power group. The question is, what are
the realistic chances of getting any large group of
women to act as a bloc?
Very small.
The Democrats would be delighted if they
could get all the Democrats to agree on
something—on anything!
No Agreement
And groups don't have to be all that big to be
powerful. Smaller blocs, such as Jews, Italian-
Americans, Polish-Americans, Ku Klux Klans
men, Communists—any ethnic, political or social
group—potentially has power, if it can only get
all its constituents to act in unison on an issue.
None of the above groups, to my knowledge
(with the exception of the Communist Party 40
years ago) has ever managed to get all of its
members to agree on anything. And each of these
groups includes women as a subset! If the
Communists can't get all women Communists to
agree on something, what are the chances that
any women's group can get all women to agree
on anything?
As I said, very small.
OK, maybe I'm being too restrictive. Women
constitute 53 percent of the population. If you
can get one tenth of these women to act in
unison on some subject, you have a force to
contend with.
'Lib' A Loser?
I maintain that if this should occur, the
present Women's Liberation power structure will
have little or nothing to do with it. Quite plainly,
"Women's Lib" is a loser outside of the big cities
and the college campuses.
To quote Arlene Croce, the editor of "Ballet

Review," in a recent paper in "Commentary"
("Sexism in the Head," Vol. 51, No. 3, March
1971, p. 63): "...Women's Liberation, so
called, is the only movement that has to struggle
full time to pursuade its constituents of their
need to be liberated."
It's true. Look around you at Stanford, at this
campus chock full of self-aware, self-conscious
people. Even here, a sizeable proportion of
women seem to believe that male chauvinism can
be fun.
Middle America
If the movement limps along so badly in a
sophisticated university environment, what must
it be like out on the hustings, where most of
America's women live, married to their lower
middle class blue- or white-collar worker, with
the 3.2 children? How susceptible are these
women to the agrument that they have been
living in a fool's paradise, oppressed, persecuted,
and insulted, chained to a home and a family as
house-slaves?
How would you feel if you struggled through
20 years of married life, raising a family, going to
church on Sunday, God-fearing and loyal to your
husband, and then some cross between a hippie
and a harpie, with a name like Gloria Steinem or
Bella Abzug ("What kind of name is that for an
American—she must be a Jew or a Pollack or
something!") comes along and tells you you've
wasted your life?
How can you build a grass-roots movement
when the leaders of the movement seem to be
lesbians or revolutionaries and scare the hell out
of the grass-roots constituents?
To wrap it up, the movement is becoming
ingrown, with all the decadence usually associat
ed with self-hatred and bitterness. Betty Friedan,
the founder of the National Organization of
Women, just got a divorce, and Ti-Grace
Atkinson has announced that the only way to be
truly liberated is to renounce the oppressor
male and withdraw into an all-female society.
Leadership Failure
That may have some merit, but 1 think an
analysis on the basis of population genetics will
demonstrate that such a society is not likely to
be successful in an evolutionary sense, and is
probably unstable in a psychological sense.

So, while Sisterhood may be Powerful, the
power is not likely to be realized by the present
Women's Lib Establishment. I refer, of course, to
overt power, the kind traditionally exercised by
males, and not to covert power, which women
have always exercised, and probably will
continue to exercise, come hell or high
Liberation.
Women have effectively controlled society
from the sidelines for eons; Sisterhood is
Powerful in the same way that John Ralston is
powerful, as he sits back and watches the players
he controls get their brains beat out to gather his
roses (no offense John—just an illustration).
I don't want to be treated like an object—l'm
with you, lady! I don't want to be treated like an
object either, and I would guess that I'm treated
like an object by the women I know as often as
they are treated like objects by their male
friends. Object-treatment is not sex-specific.
Of course, we are really speaking of two
different phenomena when we talk of women
being treated as objects. First, there is the
individual depersonification mentioned above.
Second, perhaps more galling to some women,
there is the meat parade-dumb blonde syndrome,
personified by "Playboy" and the Miss What-Not
Pageant, in which women are paraded about as
symbols.
Skeptophilia vs Exhibitionism
I have never quite understood the objections
women have to my looking at other women. It
seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.
Psychologists call it skeptophilia, the love of
observing. All evidence indicates that male
human beings have been plagued with this disease
from the beginning of recorded history. Most of
us have learned to live with it.
Women don't seem to get the same thrill from
observing male bodies as men have from
observing females. If there were any sizeable
demand by women for male prostitutes, male
strip teases or male nudie magazines, I'm sure our
great free enterprise system would rise to the
occasion.
Women, on the contrary, seem to derive
pleasure from observing men observing women
(particularly if the subject is themselves, and the

observing isn't too obvious). Perhaps women are
as naturally exhibitionistic as men are skepto
philiac. It wouldn't be the first time the sexes
had complemented each other's behavior.
Individual Considerations
The place for women is in the home —Non
sense. The place for a woman is wherever she can
contribute most to her society and herself. If this
Ls in the home, fine; if it is in business, also fine.
The only sticky point comes with the advent
of young children. I wouldn't want to say
catagorically that women are better endowed to
care for young children than are men, but
biology certainly would suggest it, as would the
habits of most other higher mammals; not to
mention most of the mothers I have known, each
of whom recognizes her husband's incompetence
as clearly as she does her own obligations toward
her baby.
How a mother manages to reconcile her duties
to her family with her desire to get out of the
damned house is a problem that must be solved
by herself, together with her husband. I don't
believe there is any general solution, or any
hard-and-fast rule. How they do it is their
business, none of mine—or yours.

sense. The place for a woman is wherever she can
contribute most to her society and herself. If this
Ls in the home, fine; if it is in business, also fine.
The only sticky point comes with the advent
of young children. I wouldn't want to say
catagorically that women are better endowed to
care for young children than are men, but
biology certainly would suggest it, as would the
habits of most other higher mammals; not to
mention most of the mothers I have known, each
of whom recognizes her husband's incompetence
as clearly as she does her own obligations toward
her baby.
How a mother manages to reconcile her duties
to her family with her desire to get out of the
damned house is a problem that must be solved
by herself, together with her husband. I don't
believe there is any general solution, or any
hard-and-fast rule. How they do it is their
business, none of mine—or yours.
The Women's Lib Pantheon of Heroes—Every
movement needs its scapegoats. Here are some of
the people, who by their work or by their
temperment, have made The Movement possible
by giving it someone to throw things at.
Many of these men are dead. So much the
better. They can't duck.

Navy, and Stokely Carmichael ("the only
position for a woman in SNCC is prone").
Women's Lib makes strange bedfellows.
Women are naturally smarter than men—l used

Well, how much can a guy take? It seems that
even if I don't say anything, I'm going to get in
trouble.
I make no claim to be an expert on either
Women's Liberation or on women. This paper
wasn't my idea. In fact, when I thought about
the thing for a couple of days and realized that
no matter what I said somebody would get mad
at me, I told the Daily's opinions editor to forget
it. She called me a yellow coward, and demanded
to know whether I was "a man or a mouse?"
I speak from a man's perspective. A friend of
mine once said that no man could ever write
about women's problems, because no man could
ever know what it is like to be a woman. I agree.
Since I really haven't given the Women's
Liberation movement the serious study it
deserves, I shall simply meander through some of
the more significant slogans, phrases and
catchalls, and see where it takes me.
Women Always Right
For my Sisters who claim that I am not
capable of writing a coherent paper on the
subject, I confess: I am not. Even if I were, I
wouldn't argue the point. When I was a little boy
my mother told me that a lady is always right.
Personal observation has confirmed this many
times.
So, if you're ready, I'll gird up my loins, you
gird up whatever you've got that needs girding,
and we'll ramble down the thorny path of
Women's Lib.
Women are oppressed—l shall get off on the
right foot by accepting this as obvious. Taken in
the loosest sense of the word, women certainly
are oppressed. Unfortunately, taken in the
loosest sense of the word, so are many other
classes of beings, most of them more sorely so
than women (e.g., blue whales, peregrine falcons,
timber wolves, etc.).
While I sympathize with women who feel they
are being shafted by society, I really can't feel as
sorry for them as for the poor birds who had oil
spilled all over them last winter.
Tough World
I readily concede that in the economic sphere,
women are suffering a gross injustice. Common
sense and decency demand that employment,
pay, the opportunity for advancement, and all

the other concommitants of the business world
not be based on any factor other than job
performance. It is clear that, at this time, women
are not being treated fairly in the labor market.
But taken in the larger sense of the word,
women are no more oppressed by society than
are men. They may be oppressed in different
ways, but not, I believe, more severely.
Everyone bitches. It's a tough world.
Sisterhood is Powerful— Right again! You bet
your bazooms Sisterhood is Powerful. Anytime
you get half the population of the country
agreeing on something, you've got yourself one
hell of a power group. The question is, what are
the realistic chances of getting any large group of
women to act as a bloc?
Very small.
The Democrats would be delighted if they
could get all the Democrats to agree on
something—on anything!
No Agreement
And groups don't have to be all that big to be
powerful. Smaller blocs, such as Jews, Italian-
Americans, Polish-Americans, Ku Klux Klans
men, Communists—any ethnic, political or social
group—potentially has power, if it can only get
all its constituents to act in unison on an issue.
None of the above groups, to my knowledge
(with the exception of the Communist Party 40
years ago) has ever managed to get all of its
members to agree on anything. And each of these
groups includes women as a subset! If the
Communists can't get all women Communists to
agree on something, what are the chances that
any women's group can get all women to agree
on anything?
As I said, very small.
OK, maybe I'm being too restrictive. Women
constitute 53 percent of the population. If you
can get one tenth of these women to act in
unison on some subject, you have a force to
contend with.
'Lib' A Loser?
I maintain that if this should occur, the
present Women's Liberation power structure will
have little or nothing to do with it. Quite plainly,
"Women's Lib" is a loser outside of the big cities
and the college campuses.
To quote Arlene Croce, the editor of "Ballet

Review," in a recent paper in "Commentary"
("Sexism in the Head," Vol. 51, No. 3, March
1971, p. 63): "...Women's Liberation, so
called, is the only movement that has to struggle
full time to pursuade its constituents of their
need to be liberated."
It's true. Look around you at Stanford, at this
campus chock full of self-aware, self-conscious
people. Even here, a sizeable proportion of
women seem to believe that male chauvinism can
be fun.
Middle America
If the movement limps along so badly in a
sophisticated university environment, what must
it be like out on the hustings, where most of
America's women live, married to their lower
middle class blue- or white-collar worker, with
the 3.2 children? How susceptible are these
women to the agrument that they have been
living in a fool's paradise, oppressed, persecuted,
and insulted, chained to a home and a family as
house-slaves?
How would you feel if you struggled through
20 years of married life, raising a family, going to
church on Sunday, God-fearing and loyal to your
husband, and then some cross between a hippie
and a harpie, with a name like Gloria Steinem or
Bella Abzug ("What kind of name is that for an
American—she must be a Jew or a Pollack or
something!") comes along and tells you you've
wasted your life?
How can you build a grass-roots movement
when the leaders of the movement seem to be
lesbians or revolutionaries and scare the hell out
of the grass-roots constituents?
To wrap it up, the movement is becoming
ingrown, with all the decadence usually associat
ed with self-hatred and bitterness. Betty Friedan,
the founder of the National Organization of
Women, just got a divorce, and Ti-Grace
Atkinson has announced that the only way to be
truly liberated is to renounce the oppressor
male and withdraw into an all-female society.
Leadership Failure
That may have some merit, but 1 think an
analysis on the basis of population genetics will
demonstrate that such a society is not likely to
be successful in an evolutionary sense, and is
probably unstable in a psychological sense.

So, while Sisterhood may be Powerful, the
power is not likely to be realized by the present
Women's Lib Establishment. I refer, of course, to
overt power, the kind traditionally exercised by
males, and not to covert power, which women
have always exercised, and probably will
continue to exercise, come hell or high
Liberation.
Women have effectively controlled society
from the sidelines for eons; Sisterhood is
Powerful in the same way that John Ralston is
powerful, as he sits back and watches the players
he controls get their brains beat out to gather his
roses (no offense John—just an illustration).
I don't want to be treated like an object—l'm
with you, lady! I don't want to be treated like an
object either, and I would guess that I'm treated
like an object by the women I know as often as
they are treated like objects by their male
friends. Object-treatment is not sex-specific.
Of course, we are really speaking of two
different phenomena when we talk of women
being treated as objects. First, there is the
individual depersonification mentioned above.
Second, perhaps more galling to some women,
there is the meat parade-dumb blonde syndrome,
personified by "Playboy" and the Miss What-Not
Pageant, in which women are paraded about as
symbols.
Skeptophilia vs Exhibitionism
I have never quite understood the objections
women have to my looking at other women. It
seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.
Psychologists call it skeptophilia, the love of
observing. All evidence indicates that male
human beings have been plagued with this disease
from the beginning of recorded history. Most of
us have learned to live with it.
Women don't seem to get the same thrill from
observing male bodies as men have from
observing females. If there were any sizeable
demand by women for male prostitutes, male
strip teases or male nudie magazines, I'm sure our
great free enterprise system would rise to the
occasion.
Women, on the contrary, seem to derive
pleasure from observing men observing women
(particularly if the subject is themselves, and the

observing isn't too obvious). Perhaps women are
as naturally exhibitionistic as men are skepto
philiac. It wouldn't be the first time the sexes
had complemented each other's behavior.

seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.
Psychologists call it skeptophilia, the love of
observing. All evidence indicates that male
human beings have been plagued with this disease
from the beginning of recorded history. Most of
us have learned to live with it.
Women don't seem to get the same thrill from
observing male bodies as men have from
observing females. If there were any sizeable
demand by women for male prostitutes, male
strip teases or male nudie magazines, I'm sure our
great free enterprise system would rise to the
occasion.
Women, on the contrary, seem to derive
pleasure from observing men observing women
(particularly if the subject is themselves, and the

observing isn't too obvious). Perhaps women are
as naturally exhibitionistic as men are skepto
philiac. It wouldn't be the first time the sexes
had complemented each other's behavior.
Individual Considerations
The place for women is in the home —Non
sense. The place for a woman is wherever she can
contribute most to her society and herself. If this
Ls in the home, fine; if it is in business, also fine.
The only sticky point comes with the advent
of young children. I wouldn't want to say
catagorically that women are better endowed to
care for young children than are men, but
biology certainly would suggest it, as would the
habits of most other higher mammals; not to
mention most of the mothers I have known, each
of whom recognizes her husband's incompetence
as clearly as she does her own obligations toward
her baby.
How a mother manages to reconcile her duties
to her family with her desire to get out of the
damned house is a problem that must be solved
by herself, together with her husband. I don't
believe there is any general solution, or any
hard-and-fast rule. How they do it is their
business, none of mine—or yours.

Well, how much can a guy take? It seems that
even if I don't say anything, I'm going to get in
trouble.
I make no claim to be an expert on either
Women's Liberation or on women. This paper
wasn't my idea. In fact, when I thought about
the thing for a couple of days and realized that
no matter what I said somebody would get mad
at me, I told the Daily's opinions editor to forget
it. She called me a yellow coward, and demanded
to know whether I was "a man or a mouse?"
I speak from a man's perspective. A friend of
mine once said that no man could ever write
about women's problems, because no man could
ever know what it is like to be a woman. I agree.
Since I really haven't given the Women's
Liberation movement the serious study it
deserves, I shall simply meander through some of
the more significant slogans, phrases and
catchalls, and see where it takes me.
Women Always Right
For my Sisters who claim that I am not
capable of writing a coherent paper on the
subject, I confess: I am not. Even if I were, I
wouldn't argue the point. When I was a little boy
my mother told me that a lady is always right.
Personal observation has confirmed this many
times.
So, if you're ready, I'll gird up my loins, you
gird up whatever you've got that needs girding,
and we'll ramble down the thorny path of
Women's Lib.
Women are oppressed—l shall get off on the
right foot by accepting this as obvious. Taken in
the loosest sense of the word, women certainly
are oppressed. Unfortunately, taken in the
loosest sense of the word, so are many other
classes of beings, most of them more sorely so
than women (e.g., blue whales, peregrine falcons,
timber wolves, etc.).
While I sympathize with women who feel they
are being shafted by society, I really can't feel as
sorry for them as for the poor birds who had oil
spilled all over them last winter.
Tough World
I readily concede that in the economic sphere,
women are suffering a gross injustice. Common
sense and decency demand that employment,
pay, the opportunity for advancement, and all

the other concommitants of the business world
not be based on any factor other than job
performance. It is clear that, at this time, women
are not being treated fairly in the labor market.
But taken in the larger sense of the word,
women are no more oppressed by society than
are men. They may be oppressed in different
ways, but not, I believe, more severely.
Everyone bitches. It's a tough world.
Sisterhood is Powerful— Right again! You bet
your bazooms Sisterhood is Powerful. Anytime
you get half the population of the country
agreeing on something, you've got yourself one
hell of a power group. The question is, what are
the realistic chances of getting any large group of
women to act as a bloc?
Very small.
The Democrats would be delighted if they
could get all the Democrats to agree on
something—on anything!
No Agreement
And groups don't have to be all that big to be
powerful. Smaller blocs, such as Jews, Italian-
Americans, Polish-Americans, Ku Klux Klans
men, Communists—any ethnic, political or social
group—potentially has power, if it can only get
all its constituents to act in unison on an issue.
None of the above groups, to my knowledge
(with the exception of the Communist Party 40
years ago) has ever managed to get all of its
members to agree on anything. And each of these
groups includes women as a subset! If the
Communists can't get all women Communists to
agree on something, what are the chances that
any women's group can get all women to agree
on anything?
As I said, very small.
OK, maybe I'm being too restrictive. Women
constitute 53 percent of the population. If you
can get one tenth of these women to act in
unison on some subject, you have a force to
contend with.
'Lib' A Loser?
I maintain that if this should occur, the
present Women's Liberation power structure will
have little or nothing to do with it. Quite plainly,
"Women's Lib" is a loser outside of the big cities
and the college campuses.
To quote Arlene Croce, the editor of "Ballet

Review," in a recent paper in "Commentary"
("Sexism in the Head," Vol. 51, No. 3, March
1971, p. 63): "...Women's Liberation, so
called, is the only movement that has to struggle
full time to pursuade its constituents of their
need to be liberated."
It's true. Look around you at Stanford, at this
campus chock full of self-aware, self-conscious
people. Even here, a sizeable proportion of
women seem to believe that male chauvinism can
be fun.
Middle America
If the movement limps along so badly in a
sophisticated university environment, what must
it be like out on the hustings, where most of
America's women live, married to their lower
middle class blue- or white-collar worker, with
the 3.2 children? How susceptible are these
women to the agrument that they have been
living in a fool's paradise, oppressed, persecuted,
and insulted, chained to a home and a family as
house-slaves?
How would you feel if you struggled through
20 years of married life, raising a family, going to
church on Sunday, God-fearing and loyal to your
husband, and then some cross between a hippie
and a harpie, with a name like Gloria Steinem or
Bella Abzug ("What kind of name is that for an
American—she must be a Jew or a Pollack or
something!") comes along and tells you you've
wasted your life?
How can you build a grass-roots movement
when the leaders of the movement seem to be
lesbians or revolutionaries and scare the hell out
of the grass-roots constituents?
To wrap it up, the movement is becoming
ingrown, with all the decadence usually associat
ed with self-hatred and bitterness. Betty Friedan,
the founder of the National Organization of
Women, just got a divorce, and Ti-Grace
Atkinson has announced that the only way to be
truly liberated is to renounce the oppressor
male and withdraw into an all-female society.
Leadership Failure
That may have some merit, but 1 think an
analysis on the basis of population genetics will
demonstrate that such a society is not likely to
be successful in an evolutionary sense, and is
probably unstable in a psychological sense.

So, while Sisterhood may be Powerful, the
power is not likely to be realized by the present
Women's Lib Establishment. I refer, of course, to
overt power, the kind traditionally exercised by
males, and not to covert power, which women
have always exercised, and probably will
continue to exercise, come hell or high
Liberation.
Women have effectively controlled society
from the sidelines for eons; Sisterhood is
Powerful in the same way that John Ralston is
powerful, as he sits back and watches the players
he controls get their brains beat out to gather his
roses (no offense John—just an illustration).
I don't want to be treated like an object—l'm
with you, lady! I don't want to be treated like an
object either, and I would guess that I'm treated
like an object by the women I know as often as
they are treated like objects by their male
friends. Object-treatment is not sex-specific.
Of course, we are really speaking of two
different phenomena when we talk of women
being treated as objects. First, there is the
individual depersonification mentioned above.
Second, perhaps more galling to some women,
there is the meat parade-dumb blonde syndrome,
personified by "Playboy" and the Miss What-Not
Pageant, in which women are paraded about as
symbols.
Skeptophilia vs Exhibitionism

women have to my looking at other women. It
seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.

I don't want to be treated like an object—l'm
with you, lady! I don't want to be treated like an
object either, and I would guess that I'm treated
like an object by the women I know as often as
they are treated like objects by their male
friends. Object-treatment is not sex-specific.
Of course, we are really speaking of two
different phenomena when we talk of women
being treated as objects. First, there is the
individual depersonification mentioned above.
Second, perhaps more galling to some women,
there is the meat parade-dumb blonde syndrome,
personified by "Playboy" and the Miss What-Not
Pageant, in which women are paraded about as
symbols.
Skeptophilia vs Exhibitionism
I have never quite understood the objections
women have to my looking at other women. It
seems harmless enough, it doesn't hurt anybody,
at all, and it gives me some cheap pleasure.
Psychologists call it skeptophilia, the love of
observing. All evidence indicates that male
human beings have been plagued with this disease
from the beginning of recorded history. Most of
us have learned to live with it.
Women don't seem to get the same thrill from
observing male bodies as men have from
observing females. If there were any sizeable
demand by women for male prostitutes, male
strip teases or male nudie magazines, I'm sure our
great free enterprise system would rise to the
occasion.
Women, on the contrary, seem to derive
pleasure from observing men observing women
(particularly if the subject is themselves, and the

observing isn't too obvious). Perhaps women are
as naturally exhibitionistic as men are skepto
philiac. It wouldn't be the first time the sexes
had complemented each other's behavior.
Individual Considerations
The place for women is in the home —Non
sense. The place for a woman is wherever she can
contribute most to her society and herself. If this
Ls in the home, fine; if it is in business, also fine.
The only sticky point comes with the advent
of young children. I wouldn't want to say
catagorically that women are better endowed to
care for young children than are men, but
biology certainly would suggest it, as would the
habits of most other higher mammals; not to
mention most of the mothers I have known, each
of whom recognizes her husband's incompetence
as clearly as she does her own obligations toward
her baby.
How a mother manages to reconcile her duties
to her family with her desire to get out of the
damned house is a problem that must be solved
by herself, together with her husband. I don't
believe there is any general solution, or any
hard-and-fast rule. How they do it is their
business, none of mine—or yours.
The Women's Lib Pantheon of Heroes—Every
movement needs its scapegoats. Here are some of
the people, who by their work or by their
temperment, have made The Movement possible
by giving it someone to throw things at.
Many of these men are dead. So much the
better. They can't duck.
Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Norman
Mailer, Lionel Tiger, Richard Nixon, Hugh
Hefner, William Rogers, Henry Kissinger ("(
wonder who's Kissinger now, lala"), Casanova,
Sally Stanford, William Shakespeare, Flo Zieg
field, Benjamin Spock, Eugene McCarthy, the US
Navy, and Stokely Carmichael ("the only
position for a woman in SNCC is prone").
Women's Lib makes strange bedfellows.
Women are naturally smarter than men—l used
to think so, but now I'm not so sure any more.
Some of my best friends arc women—As of

Well, how much can a guy take? It seems that
even if I don't say anything, I'm going to get in
trouble.
I make no claim to be an expert on either
Women's Liberation or on women. This paper
wasn't my idea. In fact, when I thought about
the thing for a couple of days and realized that
no matter what I said somebody would get mad
at me, I told the Daily's opinions editor to forget
it. She called me a yellow coward, and demanded
to know whether I was "a man or a mouse?"
I speak from a man's perspective. A friend of
mine once said that no man could ever write
about women's problems, because no man could
ever know what it is like to be a woman. I agree.
Since I really haven't given the Women's
Liberation movement the serious study it
deserves, I shall simply meander through some of
the more significant slogans, phrases and
catchalls, and see where it takes me.
Women Always Right
For my Sisters who claim that I am not
capable of writing a coherent paper on the
subject, I confess: I am not. Even if I were, I
wouldn't argue the point. When I was a little boy
my mother told me that a lady is always right.
Personal observation has confirmed this many
times.
So, if you're ready, I'll gird up my loins, you
gird up whatever you've got that needs girding,
and we'll ramble down the thorny path of
Women's Lib.
Women are oppressed—l shall get off on the
right foot by accepting this as obvious. Taken in
the loosest sense of the word, women certainly
are oppressed. Unfortunately, taken in the
loosest sense of the word, so are many other
classes of beings, most of them more sorely so
than women (e.g., blue whales, peregrine falcons,
timber wolves, etc.).
While I sympathize with women who feel they
are being shafted by society, I really can't feel as
sorry for them as for the poor birds who had oil
spilled all over them last winter.
Tough World
I readily concede that in the economic sphere,
women are suffering a gross injustice. Common
sense and decency demand that employment,
pay, the opportunity for advancement, and all

the other concommitants of the business world
not be based on any factor other than job
performance. It is clear that, at this time, women
are not being treated fairly in the labor market.
But taken in the larger sense of the word,
women are no more oppressed by society than
are men. They may be oppressed in different
ways, but not, I believe, more severely.
Everyone bitches. It's a tough world.
Sisterhood is Powerful— Right again! You bet
your bazooms Sisterhood is Powerful. Anytime
you get half the population of the country
agreeing on something, you've got yourself one
hell of a power group. The question is, what are
the realistic chances of getting any large group of
women to act as a bloc?
Very small.
The Democrats would be delighted if they
could get all the Democrats to agree on
something—on anything!
No Agreement
And groups don't have to be all that big to be
powerful. Smaller blocs, such as Jews, Italian-
Americans, Polish-Americans, Ku Klux Klans
men, Communists—any ethnic, political or social
group—potentially has power, if it can only get
all its constituents to act in unison on an issue.
None of the above groups, to my knowledge
(with the exception of the Communist Party 40
years ago) has ever managed to get all of its
members to agree on anything. And each of these
groups includes women as a subset! If the
Communists can't get all women Communists to
agree on something, what are the chances that
any women's group can get all women to agree
on anything?
As I said, very small.
OK, maybe I'm being too restrictive. Women
constitute 53 percent of the population. If you
can get one tenth of these women to act in
unison on some subject, you have a force to
contend with.
'Lib' A Loser?
I maintain that if this should occur, the
present Women's Liberation power structure will
have little or nothing to do with it. Quite plainly,
"Women's Lib" is a loser outside of the big cities
and the college campuses.
To quote Arlene Croce, the editor of "Ballet

Review," in a recent paper in "Commentary"
("Sexism in the Head," Vol. 51, No. 3, March
1971, p. 63): "...Women's Liberation, so
called, is the only movement that has to struggle
full time to pursuade its constituents of their
need to be liberated."
It's true. Look around you at Stanford, at this
campus chock full of self-aware, self-conscious
people. Even here, a sizeable proportion of
women seem to believe that male chauvinism can
be fun.
Middle America
If the movement limps along so badly in a
sophisticated university environment, what must
it be like out on the hustings, where most of
America's women live, married to their lower
middle class blue- or white-collar worker, with
the 3.2 children? How susceptible are these
women to the agrument that they have been
living in a fool's paradise, oppressed, persecuted,
and insulted, chained to a home and a family as
house-slaves?
How would you feel if you struggled through
20 years of married life, raising a family, going to
church on Sunday, God-fearing and loyal to your
husband, and then some cross between a hippie
and a harpie, with a name like Gloria Steinem or
Bella Abzug ("What kind of name is that for an
American—she must be a Jew or a Pollack or
something!") comes along and tells you you've
wasted your life?
How can you build a grass-roots movement
when the leaders of the movement seem to be
lesbians or revolutionaries and scare the hell out
of the grass-roots constituents?
To wrap it up, the movement is becoming
ingrown, with all the decadence usually associat
ed with self-hatred and bitterness. Betty Friedan,
the founder of the National Organization of
Women, just got a divorce, and Ti-Grace
Atkinson has announced that the only way to be
truly liberated is to renounce the oppressor
male and withdraw into an all-female society.
Leadership Failure
That may have some merit, but 1 think an
analysis on the basis of population genetics will
demonstrate that such a society is not likely to
be successful in an evolutionary sense, and is
probably unstable in a psychological sense.

So, while Sisterhood may be Powerful, the
power is not likely to be realized by the present
Women's Lib Establishment. I refer, of course, to
overt power, the kind traditionally exercised by
males, and not to covert power, which women
have always exercised, and probably will
continue to exercise, come hell or high
Liberation.
Women have effectively controlled society
from the sidelines for eons; Sisterhood is
Powerful in the same way that John Ralston is
powerful, as he sits back and watches the players
he controls get their brains beat out to gather his
roses (no offense John—just an illustration).
