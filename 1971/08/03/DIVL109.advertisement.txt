Today is August 3, 1971. On August 4, 1735, John Peter
$ Zengcr, the. editor of the Weekly Journal, was acquitted of the \
$ charge of libelling the British governor of New York by $
$ criticizing his conduct in office. Thus, the principle of a free \
$ and independent press was first established in this country, a $
ยง principle recently under attack, but reaffirmed by the
$ Congress and the Supreme Court.
