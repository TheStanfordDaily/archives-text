# Sallye Davis Speaks
## Support Asked For Angela 
### PAT STANFORD 
"Angela Davis has fought since
her childhood against the madness
of oppression," her mother told
an enthusiastic audience in TVesid
der Union Sunday night.
Mrs. Sally Davis, a school
teacher in Birmingham, Alabama
for 27 years, was speaking in
California trying to raise support
for her daughter.
"I bring you warm greetings
from Angela, who has been in jail
for the past nine months," stated
the Birmingham school teacher.
She commented that the recent
refusal of bail for Miss Davis "was
a tremendous disappointment, es
pecially since the Marin probation

office had recommended bail to
the court and the judge had
refused to grant it.
"Angela has not committed any
crime," she emphasized, "yet she
is being treated as guilty until
proven innocent by the court,
especially when the bail was set at
$100,000 and still refused."
Mrs. Davis went on to describe
her daughter's childhood exper
iences in Birmingham, such as
living on "dynamite hill" and
constantly being subjected to
racial discrimination in the south
ern city. As a teenager, Angela
helped to organize boycotts and
demonstrations. And as she be
came older her awareness of the
black oppression intensified her

desire to liberate all oppressed
people, her mother said. "Because
she dared to speak out against this
madness, a vicious attempt has
been made to silence her."
In reference to her daughter's
present condition, Mrs. Davis said,
"Angela's spirits are very high, in
spit° of the inhumane treatment
she has received, and she radiates
confidence and optimism."
In was also mentioned that the
former UCLA professor has com
piled a book during her incarcera
tion which will be published in
September, the month her trial
will probably begin.
After expressing the mental
hardship that the case has had on
the Davis family, her mother
remarked, "I truthfully wonder
sometimes how my daughter can
be so confident, yet she knows
that she is innocent of all the
charges, and she has confidence in
the people who realize that not
only is her case important but also
that America is on trial."
"We have always been proud of
Angela because she has the cour
age to stand up and fight, and
because she is making a tremen
dous sacrifice we must not let her
down," Mrs. Davis said.
In reference to activities sup
porting Angela, her mother ana
logized the situation to the recent
mass protests in Lt. William
Calley's case. She said Galley was
guilty but received a presidential
reprieve because of mass support.
She also cited the recent demon
stration in Berkeley proclaimed as
"Angela Davis Day" by Mayor
Warren Widener as the type of
involvement to help her daughter.


ANGELA'S MOM—Mrs. Sally Davis, mother of Angela Davis, spoke
on behalf of her daughter Sunday night in Tresidder Union. Mrs. Davis
is on a speaking tour to generate popular support for the former
UCLA instructor who has been accused of murder and conspiracy in
