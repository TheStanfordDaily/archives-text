FCM CHARGES RADICALS
It was probably "one of the more
organized types of radical groups" which
firebombed the Free Campus Movement's
headquarters last week, according to Ray
White, its acting chairman.
In an interview with the Daily White
further stated that "I assume that the
leaflet that went out on the fired workers
is what caused the incident." He denied
knowledge of who put out the leaflet, but
said, "I could probably find out if I wanted
to."
White, who as chairman of the conserva
tive, outspokenly anti-radical FCM fre
quently has gained the ire of local radicals
this year, said that the summer has been
relatively quiet for his group. There have
been no meetings, but the group has shown
up at several rallies for fired workers.
According to White, "Somebody hears
that there is a sit-in going on at Encina and
you can predict that some of our people
are going to wander over... to keep track
of the opposition."
LOCKHEED WINS
The United States Senate approved a bill
authorizing the government to guarantee
$250 million dollars in loans to the
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation. The 49-48
vote ended thirteen days of debate that
had deadlocked the Senate since July 21.
The bill was identical to a version passed
by the House, and was immediately sent to
the President for his signature. Lockheed
has claimed that it needs the guarantee to
complete work on the TriStar jet, and that
failure to obtain government support
would result in almost immediate bank
ruptcy for the giant aerospace firm.

TWO CHINA POLICY
In a dramatic reversal of policy, the
United States announced yesterday that it
will support the admission of The People's
Republic of China to the U.N. However,
the United States reaffired that it will resist
any attempt to expel Nationalist China
from the world body.
In a prepared statement read by
Secretary of State William P. Rogers, the
United States praised the record of the
Nationalists in the U.N., and declared that
"The position of the United States is that
if the United Nations is to succeed in its
peace-keeping role, it must deal with the
realities of the world in which we live.
Thus, the United States will cooperate with
those who ... wish to continue to have the
Republic of China represented in the
United Nations."
COCAINE BUST
In a raid involving Palo Alto police,
Santa Clara County narcotics bureau
detectives, and Los Angeles detectives,

largest of its kind in this area, and netted
two pounds of uncut cocaine.

24, of Palo Alto; Ronald F. Michaud, 27,
of Los Angeles; William M. Mason, 26,

ACLU TO AID SCHOOL AIDE

whose appointment as a multicultural aide
by the Palo Alto Unified School District
was rescinded without a hearing last week,
has announced that the American Civil
Liberties Union has agreed to support him
in legal action against the Board.
In a related incident, Pamoja Vencere

next school board meeting and "give the
fascists hell!" PEACE CORPS

U.S. and about 3.5 percent of these have the
disease itself.
