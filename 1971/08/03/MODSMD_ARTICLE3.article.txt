# New Ground Rule Established As Dolly's Grievance Resumes
## 
### BOB LITTERMAN 
John Dolly's grievance hearing
may resume shortly with several
changes in the ground rules, ac
cording to a letter sent to Dolly
by the grievance committee's new
chairman, Law Professor Byron
Sher.
The hearing began earlier this
summer after Dolly was fired for
his alleged participation in the
April 9 hospital sit-in. It was
postponed when the original
chairman, Assistant Professor H.
Keith H. Brodie, resigned.
Sher's letter, which Dolly re
ceived yesterday, detailed several
significant new developments in
the case. Among these were: that
the hearing must start over from
the beginning with the new
chairman, that the new hearing is
scheduled to begin at 9:30 Friday
morning at a place to be announc
ed, and that the committee will

allow an open hearing only "on
the clear understanding that if at
any time it becomes necessary or
desirable to do so, the committee
will convert the proceeding to a
closed hearing."
In addition the letter requested
from Dolly the following informa
tion: the name of a new employee
representative since Dolly's origin
al choice, Associate Professor of
English H. Bruce Franklin, was
ruled ineligible by Provost William
Miller; a clarification of the exact
nature of Dolly's grievance; and a
list of witnesses which Dolly
would like the committee to call
together with a statement of the
precise question or issue to which
each would address himself. The
letter said the information should
be sent as soon as possible, but
that it must be in to Sher by 5
p.m. today.
Dolly reacted to the letter with
anger. He said, "I'm really pissed
off that they are asking me on one
day notice to lay out my entire
strategy, a list of witnesses, and a
new lawyer. Besides, I'm out
looking for a new job every
morning. . . They are treating me
like I'm a professor, with nothing
to do but sit in a chair all day."
Dolly's Representative
Dolly's representative on the
committee, Roland Finston, said
that the time limit was placed for
Dolly's benefit and "If John needs
any extention, I'm sure he can
have it. Any delay is unfortunate
ly at his expense."
In asking Dolly to clarify his
grievance the letter states, "You
state your feeling that you have
been dismissed without appro
priate cause, and also state that
you have not been given adequate
opportunity to defend yourself
against the charge that you were a
participant in the Hospital sit-in
and were discharged because of
this. Because of the generality of
these statements the reviewing
committee is uncertain as to the
precise grounds of your grievance
and the exact questions that will
be in issue at the hearing.
"It is necessary at this stage to

sharpen the issues ... therefore it
is necessary that we receive from
you as soon as possible a precise
statement of your grievance. For
example, do you complain on the
ground that you were not a
participant in the occupation of
the administrative offices? or that
even if you were, such conduct is
not 'unacceptable behavior'? or
that in any event dismissal is an
excessive disciplinary action in
this case? or some other ground?"
Burden of Proof
Dolly reacted most strongly to
this section of the letter, saying,
"Nelson has fired me, and now I
have to say why its unacceptable.
It should be up to them to set a
case out, but instead they put the
onus on me. I don't even know
why I was fired ... there have
been lots of allegations, but
nothing has been proved. They are
putting the burden of proving my
innocence on me."
Dolly also said that since there
is a tape of the first hearing where
Director of Personnel Robert
Nelson testified, "I wouldn't want
to go through it again."
He further stated that before
the hearing can begin again, "I'm
going to ask who judges the
legitimacy of my representative.
I'm going to challenge the ruling,
and Bruce [Franklin, his original
representative] is going to be
there."
Finston denied that the com
mittee had intended to make the
grievance any harder for Dolly by
asking for the clarification.
Rather, he said, "It's an opportun
ity for John to strengthen his
case ... The initial request for
grievance was fairly sketchy in
terms of the specific grounds of
this grievance.
"Given now that we know
more about the firings, having
heard Nelson's train of thought,
maybe John can further define his
grievance ... and layout as pre
cisely as possible, and as broadly
as possible his grounds to be
agrieved."
