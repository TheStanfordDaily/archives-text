## Consensual Sex, Protective Laws 
### 
bill evers

(Editor's Note: This is the
second in a two-part series treat
ing government intervention in
economic matters on a gender
related basis and in private sexual
activity.)
Triangular intervention occurs,
according to Rothbard's typology,
when the invader compels a pair
of people to make an exchange or
prohibits them from doing so.
Much triangular sex-related in
tervention is simple interdiction
of certain forms of sexual activity
between freely consenting individ
uals. It also includes the regula
tion and licensing of such sex.
The institution of marriage is a
center of triangular intervention.
"Breach of promise" suits, though
now less popular than in the past,
treated offers of marriage as
binding obligations. This denies
humans the right to change their
minds. It deprives them of being
able to exercise freedom of will.
It is absolutely necessary to a
free society to be able to secede
from relationships (of whatever
kind). A laborer may forfeit
payment which has been advanced
to him, but he must be able to
quit his job. Otherwise, he has
contracted into slavery.
In the Reconstruction-era
South, employment contracts
made by blacks were considered

legally binding. Under the terms
of the Black Codes, blacks were
required to find employment.
Quitting was considered desertion,
much as it is in marriage.
Penal Servitude
Blacks who quit were rounded
up, as vagrants, and forced into
the employer's service or penal
servitude. The Radical Republi
cans of the North correctly
assessed the Black Codes as an
attempt to re-institute slavery and
denounced them.
Legal enforcement of promises
to marry and life-time marriage
contracts is a form of slavery.
Divorce should be granted upon
the unilateral request of either
party to the arrangement.
Aside from heterosexual
monogamy, the government also
intervenes in other forms of con
sensual sex to impose restrictions
on number, gender, species, age,
mode, and price.
Bigamy and group marriage are
illegal. Homosexual acts are ille
gal.
(California state assemblyman
Willie Brown recently introduced
a bill to make all sexual acts of
freely consenting adults legal. This
would legalize homosexual activi
ty, but bestiality and sexual

intercourse with consenting mi
nors would still be illegal.)
Comic Relief
Age qualifications imposed on
sexual activity have had conse
quences at once serious and
comical. According to the August
1971 "Playboy," "Courts have
found men guilty of statutory
rape when it was proven that the
men did not know the age of the
girl, when it was proven that she
had lied to him about her age,
when it was proven that she had a
history of promiscuity and even
when it was proven that she was
prostitute.
"In fact approximately 80
percent of the men serving terms
in America today for rape were
not convicted of forcible rape but
of statutory rape."
Furthermore as Jean Murphy
and Susan Deller Ross, point out:
"The sexual act is called rape,
even though consensual, because
women below this age are con
sidered too immature to give their
consent to such an important
act—though they are mature and
intelligent enough to get married
and raise babies without parental
consent at age eighteen, three
years before boys.
"Even though men bear the
brunt of this particular enforce
ment of the double standard, the
law has intended effect of making
it more difficult for a girl below
the 'age of consent' to choose her
own sexual life."
Restricts Positions
Also, the government imposes
restrictions on the positions one
can adopt during sexual inter
course and the forms of
sexual stimulation one can engage
in Quite often, state laws forbid
anything but face-to-face, male
prone, female supine intercourse.

Prostitution (the short-term
rental of sexual partners) is illegal
in all states of the Union except in
parts of Nevada. It has been
legalized in Great Britain, Scandi
navia, and a number of other
areas. In Britain, street solicitation
remains a crime, but no sexual
acts between consenting adults are
criminal any longer.
The New York Times of July
11 points out that the arrest of
suspected prostitutes on the
streets risks "violating their con
stitutional protections of due
process and equal protection of
the law. Loitering with intent to
commit a crime is punishable
where simple loitering is not, and
intent... is difficult to prove."
Paul Chevigny of the New York
Civil Liberties Union has opposed
some of the police's sweep-the
streets tactics and defended the
rights of accused prostitutes.
"After all," the Times quotes
him as saying, "if a girl proposi
tions someone, they can simply
ignore the proposition and walk
away."
Crime Committee
The San Francisco Committee
on Crime found in its recent
controversial study that more
than 50 percent of the arrests in
San Francisco in 1969 were for
statute violations which did not
transgress upon the rights of
others, i.e., crimes without vic
tims: prostitution, sexual devi
ance, drunkeness, drug use, and
gambling.
There were 3200 arrests for
prostitution; nearly one-third of
the jury trial demands in munici
pal court were in prostitution
cases.
Despite recent liberalization,
commercial endeavors in the
graphic, dramatic, and literary
arts, which are deemed sexually

provocative by the authorities, are
still regularly proscribed. The fact
that obscenity exists only in the
mind was well described by Tom
Lehrer in one of his satirical songs
of social commentary: "When
properly viewed, everything is
lewd .. . [And] filth is in the eye
of the beholder."
In addition to these prohibi
tions and regulation governing
human sexual practices, the gov
ernment engages in gender-related
triangular interference in social
and economic activity.
'Protective' Laws
There exist special state protec
tive labor laws such as those
setting limitations on hours of
work, governing weightlifting on
the job, and prohibiting night
work, which apply only to women
employees. Many states also re
serve certain jobs, such as mining
and bartending, for men only.
The hours laws force partial
unemployment on those who
would rather work longer or at
different times.
The safety codes operate, in a
sense, like preventive detention.
People's behavior is regulated in
anticipation of some future pos
sibility, instead of there being
punishment, according to liability,
solely for overt acts.
(For a discussion of the de
velopment of protective laws for
women and similar legislation, see
the chapter "How the Power Elite
Shape Social Legislation" in G.
William Domhoff's The Higher
Circles.)
Women members of the U.S.
House of Representatives attacked
the protective laws on August 10,
1970, as denying women their
equal rights.
Shirley Chisholm (D-N.Y.) said:
"There has for years been great
controversy as to the usefulness to
women of these State labor laws.
There has never been any doubt
that they worked a hardship on
women who need or want to work
overtime and on women who need
or want better paying jobs, and
there is no persuasive evidence as
to how many women benefit from
the archaic policy of the laws."
Equal Pay
"Equal pay for equal work'
laws have consequences which
lead in fact to diminished employ
ment opportunities for women by
depriving them of the right to
undercut. As Armen Alchian and
William Allen point out in their
textbook Exchange and Produc
tion:
"In many jobs where both men
and women might do equally well
in a pecuniary sense, men usually
are hired because of employer
preference for male employees.
But that preference is in part
overcome with lower-wage com
petition by women.
"Rather than try to prohibit
women from access to these jobs
in order to preserve the jobs for
men, the men will advocate 'equal
pay for equal work'—at, of course,
the wages now being paid to men.
"Men can profess to be doing
this for the benefit of women.
Whatever the motivation, the
effect is to protect men's jobs by
reducing opportunity for women
to replace men by taking a lower
salary."
A final form of triangular
intervention by the government is
the court decisions which make it
a married male's obligation to
provide support and a married
female's obligation to supply, free
of charge, domestic services.
The effect of the female's
obligation was discussed in part
one in connection with taxation.
The effect of the male's obligation
is alimony and the only surviving
instance in our legal system of
systematic and regular imprison
ment for debt. This debt, of
course, was imposed by court
order rather than voluntarily con
tracted for.
In the end, all the forms of
government regulation of human
sexual activity between freely
consenting individuals and all
gender-related labor legislation are
a derogation of the human rights
to life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness which are founded in
natural law.
To end this sort of government
intervention in people's lives, a
society must be built in which
every person has the freedom to
do all that he wills.
