where?
Editor, the Daily:
More than our interest was
aroused by your illuminating
article "Vasectomies Gain Popu
larity," on page five of the July
30, Daily.
Your revealing diagram states
that when the Vas Deferens is tied
and cut "sperm are still produced,
but blocked." This statement
stimulated one still unanswered
question: under these conditions,
where do all the sperm go?
We tried sleeping on this, but
we're still not satisfied. Can you
ease our minds on this frustrating
question?
Anxiously,
Sandra Froman

(Author's reply: The case of the
missing sperm is easily solved by
looking at paragraph three of the

article. They are simply reabsorb
ed by the man's body, and cause
no discomfort.
We wish to point out that there
is a vas deferens (sic) between
simply sleeping on this frustrating
matter, and really getting into the
subject.)

Assemblyman Willie L. Brown, Jr.
State Capitol
Please accept our deepest grati
tude for your courageous stance
against Assembly Bill No. 2591,
which would have authorized the
granting of peace officer status to
police officers at private colleges.
It was our strong feeling from
the beginning that this bill made a
mockery of the concept of demo
cratic control over the police, a
concept essential to the mainten
ance of a free society. We, as well
as a large portion of the Stanford

community, viewed with great
distress the lack of any provision
in this bill for control of the
campus police force by an elected
local official or body. It was for
this reason that we so heartily
applauded your courage and fore
sight in attacking this bill for what
it wasâ€”"the seeds of a Fascist
state."
There continues at Stanford a
battle waged by many of us to
bring the services of the Univer
sity community more fully under
the democratic control of the
people that need and pay for
those services. It heartens us to
know that on an issue as impor
tant as this, we have allies in the
State Legislature as forceful as
yourself.
With sadness, we find the
record of our own University
Administration on this issue
short-sighted and insensitive in
comparison with yours. Without
any discussion in the general

University community, without
any attempt to obtain any consen
sus from the various elements of
that community, the Office of the
President proceeded to initiate,
lobby for, and, indeed, stake the
very prestige of the University on,
a bill that was alien to the
concepts of a democracy.
