# Freitas, Jubb, Shaw
## Three Gridders End Stanford Careers Early 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
Three of four Stanford football
players whose future plans have
been in doubt, will probably not
be playing football here next
season. Of the four-Jess Freitas,
Mike Gilyard, Rufus Shaw and
Steve Jubbâ€”it appears that only
Gilyard will return.
Freitas, who was the backup
quarterback behind Heisman
Trophy winner Jim Plunkett, will
enroll at San Diego State. Shaw, a
speedy flanker on last year's
freshman team, is headed for
Southern Methodist University in
Texas. And Jubb, who has grad
uated but who was eligible for
another year of competition, will
most likely forego the extra year
to pursue his musical career.
Freitas told the Daily last week
that he has signed a letter of
intent to San Diego State. He said
he would have to redshirt this
year due to NCAA regulations,
but he would be able to play the
next two seasons for the Aztecs.
He will enroll academically and
work out with the team this fall.
He said he had contacted San
Diego State earlier this summer
after he began to think that he
might want to go somewhere else

next year. "I started looking into
other schools and I liked SDS."
"If I'd transferred to another
Pacific Eight conference school I
would have lost a year of
eligibility. San Diego State has a
good building program and they
are a team with a straight
dropback passing style. Their
present starting quarterback grad
uates after this next season and I
should have a good shot the next
two years."
Deep Roots
The departing quarterback says
the roots of his disenchantment
with Stanford's football program
go back farther than this past
year. "This final decision goes
back to when I first played here in
the spring of '70." (Freitas sat out
his freshman season with mono
nucleosis.)
"Overall I felt that I was a
victim of circumstances. I didn't
think things were working out for
me and I didn't think that they
were going to work out in the
future. I contacted Coach [John]
Ralston about two weeks ago and
he said he felt I should do what
was best for me.
"He didn't think that it would

be a good idea for me to leave. He
told me that you should never
quit anything. I really think that
he is a sincere person. But I am
interested in playing football. If I
had stayed here it looked like
there would've been a good
chance I would've been redshirted
this fall anyway."
Ralston told the Daily that he
thought both Freitas and Jubb
would be "vascillating" right up
to fall practice in late August. "I'd
still encourage them to come
back," he said.
Musical Career
Freitas seems now to be a
closed case, but it also appears
that Jubb is pretty certain not to
return. According to Jubb, "It
looks very doubtful." The 6-5 250
lb. All-Pacific-8 offensive tackle
said he most likely would "pursue
his musical career with the Great
Nameless Wonder Band."
"I would still like to play
football. But I don't think I can
do two things well at once. If
some catastrophe occurred and
the band fell apart, I would most
likely play. But although I'd
rather not say for sure, I don't
think that I'll be playing next

fall."
Regarding Shaw and Gilyard,
Ralston told the Daily that he had
not heard from either concerning
their future plans. But he did say
that since neither had come to see
him following spring practice,
neither would be allowed to
attend fall practice. "I just as
sumed they'd quit. If
they want to play, they'd have to
start when school begins in
September."
Since the fall semester does not
begin until September 27, this
would mean that they would miss
the first three games of the
season. Gilyard will apparently
attempt to play after school
begins, but Shaw is definitely not
returning.
Will Return
Last week Gilyard told the
Daily from his Dallas, Texas home
that he has decided to return to
Stanford. "I just made up my
mind to return to Stanford. I am
willing to play wherever I can fit
in best. But I still feel I have the
competitive ability to be tried as a
quarterback."
Gilyard said he would like to
participate in fall practice, but he
said he will still try to play after
school begins. Last fall Gilyard
completed 24 of 52 passes for 533
yards and 9 touchdowns while

leading the Frosh to a 3-1 record.
Shaw, who caught 16 passes for
a fine 379 yards and 4 touch
downs, on the same freshman
team, will not be back. He told
the Daily yesterday that he is
definitely going to SMU. "I had
pretty well decided to transfer to
SMU two or three weeks after
school got out. I'll have to sit out
a year, but I intend to participate
in both football and track the
following year.
"I felt that staying at Stanford
would've hindered my career and
my sanity. It wasn't the whole
school. I really dug Stanford as an
academic institution. But I was
really dismayed and disgruntled
over a couple of coaches.
"After I came to Stanford last
fall I found out that I wasn't
getting the deal I had signed for.
Lying and misrepresentation was
the basic thing. I went home for a
couple of weeks, but when I
discovered I couldn't play at SMU
last year, I came back."
In high school Shaw said he had
been interested in both schools.
But after a year at Stanford,
where he was also a quartermiler
on the track team, Shaw has
decided to move to SMU. He says
he intends to be a five year man
and use all three years of eligibil
ity following this year.
