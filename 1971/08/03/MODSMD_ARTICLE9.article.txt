# 13-Year-Old Indian Guru Spreads His 'Divine Light'
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
"The Guru is an ice cream
freak," his disciple Will said. But
that's not surprising, since Guru
Maharaj Ji is a 13-year-old "per
fect master" on his first trip
outside of India.
The young Guru, who spoke on
campus last night, is spending two
weeks in the Bay Area after
spreading "divine light" in Lon
don, Paris, and L.A.
Balyogeshwar Shru Sant Ji
Maharaj told a Memorial Auditor
ium audience of about 500, "In
me is the same manifested power
as in God... I don't declare
myself as a god, but I declare
myself that I can give you some
knowledge."
He said sensuality drains the
holy energy in most people.
"People think that eat, drink,
women is all there is to life. But
eat, drink, women is not all there
is to my own life."
Most of the Stanford audience
was college students, who the
Guru's followers said were harder
to reach than the mixed crowds
he greeted in Berkeley.
A few people got up and left

during the Guru's 45-minute lec
ture, and a few others eagerly
came forward to talk with disci
ples after the program.
The most enthusiastic crowded
the aisles to be as close as
possible. But most watched quiet
ly as the 13-year-old commented
on material craving, using Ameri
can examples ranging from the
SST to television.
His followers say the Guru—
whose father was also a holy
man—was born "a fully realized
soul" and was capable of deep
meditation at age two. At six, he
was delivering long discourses in
English. And his greatest moment
was at age eight, when he sat on
stage at his father's funeral and
told thousands of disciples to stop
weeping because, "I am the same
man."
Saturday afternoon, the Guru
and his aides were touring San
Francisco in search of ice cream,
while his followers discussed his
teaching in a house at 453 Noe
Street.
Will, a bearded American dress
ed in white Indian clothing, said
he first "took Knowledge" from
the Guru in India seven months
ago. He and several other Ameri
can disciples "were commanded
by his mother to come back to
America"and prepare for his visit.
"By his grace," the followers
are managing to stretch their

meager funds to cover all the
expenses of a traveling personal
ity. Saturday, one girl was busy
making calls in search of free
leaflet-printing. Her long tele
phone explanation of the Guru's
spiritual powers was ended when
she was passed a note pointing out
that "Berkeley is a toll call." Will
said their financial problem shows
the age old difficulty of "balanc
ing the material and the spiritual."
The American disciples spoke
with both the enthusiasm of true
believers and the calm of those
trained in the Eastern arts of
meditation. Their conversations
mixed Eastern images ("the lotus
lives in water but never becomes
wet") with American slang ("I
was really freaked the first time I
met him.")
Will explained that the Guru's
appearances create a spiritual
"thirst in people that grows until
it's unbearable." Then they recog
nize within themselves "their need
for this perfect master."
He said a hundred new follow
ers—some of them aged Christians
"who have been waiting for this
moment all their lives"—are form
ing an "ashram" in Los Angeles to
serve the Guru. He hopes to start
a San Francisco ashram to medi
tate and study the Guru's para
bles.
One of the Guru's Indian
disciples, addressed as "Mahatma

Ji," said the Guru came to the
West because Americans lack the
Indian peace of mind. He said
Indians are materially impoverish
ed but "are mentally satisfied.
They sleep very well in their small
huts and fields. They take no
sleeping tablets."
To prepare for his work in the
West, the Guru's father sent him
to English-language St. Joseph's
Academy in Dehra Dun, India.
But like other ninth-graders, the
Guru is not exactly enchanted
with math and composition.
Mahatma Ji said the Guru told his
mother, "I am perfect in my
knowledge. I don't want to waste
time in the classroom."
But his mother, whose opinion
is also holy, still wants him back
in school. Mahatma Ji said such
conflicts between Holy Mother
and Guru son are usually resolved
by "sitting down and discussing
the problem."
Will insisted the young Guru
came to the West only to share his
spiritual gifts. "He doesn't give a
damn about seeing the United
States. He didn't come here to
sightsee."
Yet Will admitted the master
"dug Disneyland" and went on

the Pirate Ship ride twice. He also
liked a "triple creature feature" at
a drive-in movie. And, of course,
he's been eating gallons of ice
cream.
According to Will, when some
one in L.A. expressed amazement
at the Guru's age, the young
master answered in a profound
voice, "I'm not 13 years old. I'm
older than 13 .. . but not quite
14."

came to the West only to share his
spiritual gifts. "He doesn't give a
damn about seeing the United
States. He didn't come here to
sightsee."
Yet Will admitted the master
"dug Disneyland" and went on

the Pirate Ship ride twice. He also
liked a "triple creature feature" at
a drive-in movie. And, of course,
he's been eating gallons of ice
cream.
According to Will, when some
one in L.A. expressed amazement
at the Guru's age, the young
master answered in a profound
voice, "I'm not 13 years old. I'm
older than 13 .. . but not quite
14."


YOUNG GURU—Guhi Maharaj Ji sat on a makeshift throne at Mem
Aud. The 13-year-old urged the onlookers to open themselves to "the
divine light"
"The Guru is an ice cream
freak," his disciple Will said. But
that's not surprising, since Guru
Maharaj Ji is a 13-year-old "per
fect master" on his first trip
outside of India.
The young Guru, who spoke on
campus last night, is spending two
weeks in the Bay Area after
spreading "divine light" in Lon
don, Paris, and L.A.
Balyogeshwar Shru Sant Ji
Maharaj told a Memorial Auditor
ium audience of about 500, "In
me is the same manifested power
as in God... I don't declare
myself as a god, but I declare
myself that I can give you some
knowledge."
He said sensuality drains the
holy energy in most people.
"People think that eat, drink,
women is all there is to life. But
eat, drink, women is not all there
is to my own life."
Most of the Stanford audience
was college students, who the
Guru's followers said were harder
to reach than the mixed crowds
he greeted in Berkeley.
A few people got up and left

during the Guru's 45-minute lec
ture, and a few others eagerly
came forward to talk with disci
ples after the program.
The most enthusiastic crowded
the aisles to be as close as
possible. But most watched quiet
ly as the 13-year-old commented
on material craving, using Ameri
can examples ranging from the
SST to television.
His followers say the Guru—
whose father was also a holy
man—was born "a fully realized
soul" and was capable of deep
meditation at age two. At six, he
was delivering long discourses in
English. And his greatest moment
was at age eight, when he sat on
stage at his father's funeral and
told thousands of disciples to stop
weeping because, "I am the same
man."
Saturday afternoon, the Guru
and his aides were touring San
Francisco in search of ice cream,
while his followers discussed his
teaching in a house at 453 Noe
Street.
Will, a bearded American dress
ed in white Indian clothing, said
he first "took Knowledge" from
the Guru in India seven months
ago. He and several other Ameri
can disciples "were commanded
by his mother to come back to
America"and prepare for his visit.
"By his grace," the followers
are managing to stretch their

meager funds to cover all the
expenses of a traveling personal
ity. Saturday, one girl was busy
making calls in search of free
leaflet-printing. Her long tele
phone explanation of the Guru's
spiritual powers was ended when
she was passed a note pointing out
that "Berkeley is a toll call." Will
said their financial problem shows
the age old difficulty of "balanc
ing the material and the spiritual."
The American disciples spoke
with both the enthusiasm of true
believers and the calm of those
trained in the Eastern arts of
meditation. Their conversations
mixed Eastern images ("the lotus
lives in water but never becomes
wet") with American slang ("I
was really freaked the first time I
met him.")
Will explained that the Guru's
appearances create a spiritual
"thirst in people that grows until
it's unbearable." Then they recog
nize within themselves "their need
for this perfect master."
He said a hundred new follow
ers—some of them aged Christians
"who have been waiting for this
moment all their lives"—are form
ing an "ashram" in Los Angeles to
serve the Guru. He hopes to start
a San Francisco ashram to medi
tate and study the Guru's para
bles.
One of the Guru's Indian
disciples, addressed as "Mahatma

Ji," said the Guru came to the
West because Americans lack the
Indian peace of mind. He said
Indians are materially impoverish
ed but "are mentally satisfied.
They sleep very well in their small
huts and fields. They take no
sleeping tablets."
To prepare for his work in the
West, the Guru's father sent him
to English-language St. Joseph's
Academy in Dehra Dun, India.
But like other ninth-graders, the
Guru is not exactly enchanted
with math and composition.
Mahatma Ji said the Guru told his
mother, "I am perfect in my
knowledge. I don't want to waste
time in the classroom."
But his mother, whose opinion
is also holy, still wants him back
in school. Mahatma Ji said such
conflicts between Holy Mother
and Guru son are usually resolved
by "sitting down and discussing
the problem."

Indian peace of mind. He said
Indians are materially impoverish
ed but "are mentally satisfied.
They sleep very well in their small
huts and fields. They take no
sleeping tablets."
To prepare for his work in the
West, the Guru's father sent him
to English-language St. Joseph's
Academy in Dehra Dun, India.
But like other ninth-graders, the
Guru is not exactly enchanted
with math and composition.
Mahatma Ji said the Guru told his
mother, "I am perfect in my
knowledge. I don't want to waste
time in the classroom."
But his mother, whose opinion
is also holy, still wants him back
in school. Mahatma Ji said such
conflicts between Holy Mother
and Guru son are usually resolved
by "sitting down and discussing
the problem."
Will insisted the young Guru
came to the West only to share his
spiritual gifts. "He doesn't give a
damn about seeing the United
States. He didn't come here to
sightsee."
Yet Will admitted the master
"dug Disneyland" and went on

the Pirate Ship ride twice. He also
liked a "triple creature feature" at
a drive-in movie. And, of course,
he's been eating gallons of ice
cream.
According to Will, when some
one in L.A. expressed amazement
at the Guru's age, the young
master answered in a profound
voice, "I'm not 13 years old. I'm
older than 13 .. . but not quite
14."


YOUNG GURU—Guhi Maharaj Ji sat on a makeshift throne at Mem
Aud. The 13-year-old urged the onlookers to open themselves to "the
divine light"
"The Guru is an ice cream
freak," his disciple Will said. But
that's not surprising, since Guru
Maharaj Ji is a 13-year-old "per
fect master" on his first trip
outside of India.
The young Guru, who spoke on
campus last night, is spending two
weeks in the Bay Area after
spreading "divine light" in Lon
don, Paris, and L.A.
Balyogeshwar Shru Sant Ji
Maharaj told a Memorial Auditor
ium audience of about 500, "In
me is the same manifested power
as in God... I don't declare
myself as a god, but I declare
myself that I can give you some
knowledge."
He said sensuality drains the
holy energy in most people.
"People think that eat, drink,
women is all there is to life. But
eat, drink, women is not all there
is to my own life."
Most of the Stanford audience
was college students, who the
Guru's followers said were harder
to reach than the mixed crowds
he greeted in Berkeley.
A few people got up and left

during the Guru's 45-minute lec
ture, and a few others eagerly
came forward to talk with disci
ples after the program.
The most enthusiastic crowded
the aisles to be as close as
possible. But most watched quiet
ly as the 13-year-old commented
on material craving, using Ameri
can examples ranging from the
SST to television.
His followers say the Guru—
whose father was also a holy
man—was born "a fully realized
soul" and was capable of deep
meditation at age two. At six, he
was delivering long discourses in
English. And his greatest moment
was at age eight, when he sat on
stage at his father's funeral and
told thousands of disciples to stop
weeping because, "I am the same
man."
Saturday afternoon, the Guru
and his aides were touring San
Francisco in search of ice cream,
while his followers discussed his
teaching in a house at 453 Noe
Street.
Will, a bearded American dress
ed in white Indian clothing, said
he first "took Knowledge" from
the Guru in India seven months
ago. He and several other Ameri
can disciples "were commanded
by his mother to come back to
America"and prepare for his visit.
"By his grace," the followers
are managing to stretch their

meager funds to cover all the
expenses of a traveling personal
ity. Saturday, one girl was busy
making calls in search of free
leaflet-printing. Her long tele
phone explanation of the Guru's
spiritual powers was ended when
she was passed a note pointing out
that "Berkeley is a toll call." Will
said their financial problem shows
the age old difficulty of "balanc
ing the material and the spiritual."
The American disciples spoke
with both the enthusiasm of true
believers and the calm of those
trained in the Eastern arts of
meditation. Their conversations
mixed Eastern images ("the lotus
lives in water but never becomes
wet") with American slang ("I
was really freaked the first time I
met him.")
Will explained that the Guru's
appearances create a spiritual
"thirst in people that grows until
it's unbearable." Then they recog
nize within themselves "their need
for this perfect master."
He said a hundred new follow
ers—some of them aged Christians
"who have been waiting for this
moment all their lives"—are form
ing an "ashram" in Los Angeles to
serve the Guru. He hopes to start
a San Francisco ashram to medi
tate and study the Guru's para
bles.
One of the Guru's Indian
disciples, addressed as "Mahatma

Ji," said the Guru came to the
West because Americans lack the
Indian peace of mind. He said
Indians are materially impoverish
ed but "are mentally satisfied.
They sleep very well in their small
huts and fields. They take no
sleeping tablets."
