# Harris Announces People's Union; First Project To Stop Navy Ship
## 
### JOHN MARKOFF 
David Harris, former Stanford Stu
dent Body President and draft resister,
has announced a new political organiza
tion, the People's Union, to which he is
now devoting himself fulltime.
The Union, a more or less undefined
political group, has set as its first major
project stopping the aircraft carrier
U.S.S. Constellation from sailing to
Vietnam on October 1. The group also
has bought a farm near Fresno which
Harris hopes will be in production by
next year.
Helping Harris to organize the Union
are Paul Barnes, a draft resister who
also helped Harris organize a food
strike in prison, and members of the
Palo Alto based Institute for the Study
of Non-Violence.
According to Harris, "The idea of
the People's Union really came into
form amongst a lot of us who were in
the penitentiary together. All of us felt
the need to take the politics that was
implicit in the Resistance and to build
it into a much more concrete form . . .
not just to begin taking on one specific
project, but taking on a broad range of
social problems in some kind of
context.
"I came out of the joint looking for
a context to put my work in. That
Stanford speech (April 3 before an
overflow crowd in Memorial Church)
was the first time I'd done anything for
two years. I was uncertain at that
Stanford speech, and obviously I'm not
over that uncertainty now. The only
way I know to deal with that problem
is that you begin to feel your way
toward something that feels comfort
able. For me that's what the People's
Union is.
Stanford Speech
"When I did that Stanford speech
there were three alternative directions I
could pursue. I could do nothing, or I
could play public personality and run
around making comments about things.
"The other alternative was to begin
collecting a set of people to work with
and begin building some kind of larger
political context, and that's the one
I've been slowly trying to do since I got
out of the joint."
In the near future the group's main
focus will be in San Diego where it will
be "plugging into" already established
anti-war groups which have been
working for some time on the attempt
to stop the Constellation from sailing.

Harris explained the project as
"going down to San Diego and
organizing our own vote amongst the
70,000 sailors in the First Fleet on the
question of whether or not the U.S.S.
Constellation ought to go back to
Vietnam on October 1 or not. We really
see ourselves as trying to go into that
situation and trying to crack open the
whole Navy scene."
Said Barnes, "What essentially is
happening is that we're going down
there to organize conflict. I don't mean
that that's what you do, but you know
that conflict is going to happen."
Harris added, "I suspect that the
scene in San Diego is going to be a very
heavy one. The Navy is not going to be
very happy to have us there, and the
police aren't going to be happy to have
us there either."
Staying Out of Jail
Both Harris and Barnes stressed that
the day to day activities of the Union
will developed as the action
progresses in San Diego. "I'm sure that
two of my activities will be trying to
stay alive and trying to stay out of jail,
which may end of consuming a lot of
time," said Harris.
He forsees "evening meetings, street
corner stuff and leaflets. The central
problem we have to overcome in San
Diego is getting information out."
According to Harris 40 sailors have
been transferred from the Constellation
for being involved with the activities of
the Concerned Officers Movement, a
naval anti-war group. So far the
People's Union has sent them an offset
press to help get information out to the
community and other San Diego
sailors.
Beg, Like Always
The Union derives funding from
several sources. It has received royalties
from the Carry It On movie about
Harris and his wife Joan Baez. It also
expects some profits from a book
recently written by Harris and another
member of the Union, Bob Fitch. Baez
has contributed from proceeds of
several of her concerts, and according
to Harris, "The other way to get money
Ls to beg, just like people have always
done it."
The future of the organization is
uncertain, he said, but "what we have
in the backs of our minds is at some
time organizing some sort of mass
organization, half-way a labor union

and half a political party . .. not in the
standard American sense of a political
party, but something much closer to
the anarchist parties in Spain. We want
to build concrete phenomenon that
people can get up next to and rub
against, because that's how people
understand."
New Constituency
Harris feels that a new political
constituency has opened up that wasn't
there five years ago. He calls them the
people who make between $8,000 and
$10,000 a year and have a mortgage on
their home. He feels that they are ready
to listen to new political alternatives.
He thinks that theories that are
popular on the left that say that third
world people in America will make the
revolution are wrong because there
aren't enough of them. "Revolution is
either going to come out of the main

blood of America, or it's not going to
come at all," he said.
Harris criticizes many of the left
organizations who spend their time
creating ideologies. "People's Union is
an organization that's not interested in
perfects, by that 1 mean not interested
in ideologies. Perfects are useless to
people, people are approximate things.
They act in approximate ways, they
just pursue directions. That means that
instead of talking about answers, what
you talk about is solutions.
"What we want to do in taking on
really concrete work projects is to learn
a lot of lessons and through those
concrete work projects begin to devel
op ourselves a base."
Harris said that the image that the
members of People's Union have is a
mechanism which will allow them to
