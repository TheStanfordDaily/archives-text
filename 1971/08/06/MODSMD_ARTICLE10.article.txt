# Varied Types Of Art

### BARBARA MEADE 
If you are up for laughs see the
Guggenhead Collection in its atro
cious entirely and come away
with a smile, maybe even an
Excedrin Headache No. 42.
By popular demand the show
has been held over two additional
weeks, showing until Friday Au
gust 20th in the second floor of
Tresidder where you can jeer,
acclaim or merely view these self
acclaimed masterpieces from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. Go early to fight
the chuckling crowds.
This incredible mishmash of
masterworks was accumulated by
Paul Anthony in 1965 and opened
in Phoenix, Arizona, where it sent
people sputtering, giggling and
some times fuming. Since 1967
the collection has been appearing
in most major cities of America,
leaving a wake of newspaper,
radio and TV publicity.
Mr. Anthony claims to have
been inspired by a seizure of
"bronchia jocularis while leafing
through an art magazine." All the
paintings, collages and assem
blages were done by special
commission, or else donated with
the agreement that the artist
remain anonymous. All of the
artists are well-known, and two or
three are nationally prominent.
Hence all attributions are ficti

tious, and Mr. Anthony gets credit
for captions.
Lots of Laughs
Laughter is the sole raison
d'etre for the show. The viewer is
assaulted with a wide range of
categories such as Misdemeanors,
Wretcheries, A Gallery ofNudies;
featuring "Staircase Descending A
Nude," by Marcel Dutel, and
"Nude Departing On Roller
Skates," by Paul Whee.
Among the Neo-Classic crackups
of this semi-hallowed collection
one is filled with awe of "Allergy
In A Chinese Garden" by Fu
AhChou. Fu's innovation was
producing flower-like forms by
inhaling blue, yellow and white
watercolors until he sneezed. But
like so many modern artists Fu
"didn't know when to stop
painting."
This show illustrates to the
limits of spoofdom the crisis
confronting a modern artist in
deciding which comes first; the
title or the painting. Guggenhead
Collection tells us the obvious, its
the title that makes it. Gaze on the
abstract "Bold Stroke With A
Limp Wrist," by Andre Frutoir,
and try to resist a smile, for the
title.
Not to be mistaken, the Gug
genhead Collection is not being
anti-modern art. Rather it is a well

intended poke-in-the-ribs pun on
contemporary art. Admission is
free for this infamously Awful
Modern Art Show. But hurry,
Standing Room Only.
Anderson Collection
Meanwhile across campus, the
Anderson Collection entitled "A
Decade In The West" is now on
exhibit in the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. The collection
offers a refreshing, yet serious
array of contemporary West Coast
Art.
This show will run through
August 15th, and the museum
sells descriptive catalogs which are
a worthwhile investment for mod
ern art enthusiasts. The emphasis
on "California Art" is presented
in a great bredth of oils, litho
graphs, polyglass forms, and mas
sive wood carvings, all of which
characterize the energetic daring
of the works of artists living and
producing work in California.
Wide Appeal
In its entirety the Anderson
Collection does not demand pen
sive reflection from the viewer,
nor does it lack the capacity to
evoke pleasure and nostalgia for
familiar California places. No
visitor can remain indifferent to
the massive robust woodwork
rendering offered by Robert Strini
at the museum entrance.
Nostalgia is summoned in such
works as Howard Hack's "Window
No. 27 Clay and Davis Street
Barber Shop," and Wayne
Thiebaud's "Candy Counter." Wil
liam Wiley's "Lame and Blind in
Eden" mocks the sunny stilllife
innocence of Robert Harvey's
"Landy and Esther in Granada."
In sharing the collection of Mr.
and Mrs. Harry Anderson, the
viewer is rewarded with experienc
ing a varied and provocative
representation of contemporary
California Art. It is considered
one of the major collections of
international modern art, art as a
reflection of life style.

sells descriptive catalogs which are
a worthwhile investment for mod
ern art enthusiasts. The emphasis
on "California Art" is presented
in a great bredth of oils, litho
graphs, polyglass forms, and mas
sive wood carvings, all of which
characterize the energetic daring
of the works of artists living and
producing work in California.
Wide Appeal
In its entirety the Anderson
Collection does not demand pen
sive reflection from the viewer,
nor does it lack the capacity to
evoke pleasure and nostalgia for
familiar California places. No
visitor can remain indifferent to
the massive robust woodwork
rendering offered by Robert Strini
at the museum entrance.
Nostalgia is summoned in such
works as Howard Hack's "Window
No. 27 Clay and Davis Street
Barber Shop," and Wayne
Thiebaud's "Candy Counter." Wil
liam Wiley's "Lame and Blind in
Eden" mocks the sunny stilllife
innocence of Robert Harvey's
"Landy and Esther in Granada."
In sharing the collection of Mr.
and Mrs. Harry Anderson, the
viewer is rewarded with experienc
ing a varied and provocative
representation of contemporary
California Art. It is considered
one of the major collections of
international modern art, art as a
reflection of life style.

This is one of the sculptures on
exhibit at the Stanford University
Museum of Art as part of "A
Decade in the West. ' "Michelin
X" is a 1965-66 work by Peter
Voulkos. Other artists represented
in the show include Robert
Motherwell, David Park and Stan
ford's own Keith Boyle. The
exhibit will continue through
August 22. Admission is free and
hours at the museum are from 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. on Tuesday
through Friday and from 1 to 5
p.m. on Saturday and Sunday.
If you are up for laughs see the
Guggenhead Collection in its atro
cious entirely and come away
with a smile, maybe even an
Excedrin Headache No. 42.
By popular demand the show
has been held over two additional
weeks, showing until Friday Au
gust 20th in the second floor of
Tresidder where you can jeer,
acclaim or merely view these self
acclaimed masterpieces from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. Go early to fight
the chuckling crowds.
This incredible mishmash of
masterworks was accumulated by
Paul Anthony in 1965 and opened
in Phoenix, Arizona, where it sent
people sputtering, giggling and
some times fuming. Since 1967
the collection has been appearing
in most major cities of America,
leaving a wake of newspaper,
radio and TV publicity.
Mr. Anthony claims to have
been inspired by a seizure of
"bronchia jocularis while leafing
through an art magazine." All the
paintings, collages and assem
blages were done by special
commission, or else donated with
the agreement that the artist
remain anonymous. All of the
artists are well-known, and two or
three are nationally prominent.
Hence all attributions are ficti

tious, and Mr. Anthony gets credit
for captions.
Lots of Laughs
Laughter is the sole raison
d'etre for the show. The viewer is
assaulted with a wide range of
categories such as Misdemeanors,
Wretcheries, A Gallery ofNudies;
featuring "Staircase Descending A
Nude," by Marcel Dutel, and
"Nude Departing On Roller
Skates," by Paul Whee.
Among the Neo-Classic crackups
of this semi-hallowed collection
one is filled with awe of "Allergy
In A Chinese Garden" by Fu
AhChou. Fu's innovation was
producing flower-like forms by
inhaling blue, yellow and white
watercolors until he sneezed. But
like so many modern artists Fu
"didn't know when to stop
painting."
This show illustrates to the
limits of spoofdom the crisis
confronting a modern artist in
deciding which comes first; the
title or the painting. Guggenhead
Collection tells us the obvious, its
the title that makes it. Gaze on the
abstract "Bold Stroke With A
Limp Wrist," by Andre Frutoir,
and try to resist a smile, for the
title.
Not to be mistaken, the Gug
genhead Collection is not being
anti-modern art. Rather it is a well

intended poke-in-the-ribs pun on
contemporary art. Admission is
free for this infamously Awful
Modern Art Show. But hurry,

gust 20th in the second floor of
Tresidder where you can jeer,
acclaim or merely view these self
acclaimed masterpieces from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m. Go early to fight
the chuckling crowds.
This incredible mishmash of
masterworks was accumulated by
Paul Anthony in 1965 and opened
in Phoenix, Arizona, where it sent
people sputtering, giggling and
some times fuming. Since 1967
the collection has been appearing
in most major cities of America,
leaving a wake of newspaper,
radio and TV publicity.
Mr. Anthony claims to have
been inspired by a seizure of
"bronchia jocularis while leafing
through an art magazine." All the
paintings, collages and assem
blages were done by special
commission, or else donated with
the agreement that the artist
remain anonymous. All of the
artists are well-known, and two or
three are nationally prominent.
Hence all attributions are ficti

tious, and Mr. Anthony gets credit
for captions.
Lots of Laughs
Laughter is the sole raison
d'etre for the show. The viewer is
assaulted with a wide range of
categories such as Misdemeanors,
Wretcheries, A Gallery ofNudies;
featuring "Staircase Descending A
Nude," by Marcel Dutel, and
"Nude Departing On Roller
Skates," by Paul Whee.
Among the Neo-Classic crackups
of this semi-hallowed collection
one is filled with awe of "Allergy
In A Chinese Garden" by Fu
AhChou. Fu's innovation was
producing flower-like forms by
inhaling blue, yellow and white
watercolors until he sneezed. But
like so many modern artists Fu
"didn't know when to stop
painting."
This show illustrates to the
limits of spoofdom the crisis
confronting a modern artist in
deciding which comes first; the
title or the painting. Guggenhead
Collection tells us the obvious, its
the title that makes it. Gaze on the
abstract "Bold Stroke With A
Limp Wrist," by Andre Frutoir,
and try to resist a smile, for the
title.
Not to be mistaken, the Gug
genhead Collection is not being
anti-modern art. Rather it is a well

intended poke-in-the-ribs pun on
contemporary art. Admission is
free for this infamously Awful
Modern Art Show. But hurry,
Standing Room Only.
Anderson Collection
Meanwhile across campus, the
Anderson Collection entitled "A
Decade In The West" is now on
exhibit in the Leland Stanford
Junior Museum. The collection
offers a refreshing, yet serious
array of contemporary West Coast
Art.
This show will run through
August 15th, and the museum
sells descriptive catalogs which are
a worthwhile investment for mod
ern art enthusiasts. The emphasis
on "California Art" is presented
in a great bredth of oils, litho
graphs, polyglass forms, and mas
sive wood carvings, all of which
characterize the energetic daring
of the works of artists living and
producing work in California.
Wide Appeal
In its entirety the Anderson
Collection does not demand pen
sive reflection from the viewer,
nor does it lack the capacity to
evoke pleasure and nostalgia for
familiar California places. No
visitor can remain indifferent to
the massive robust woodwork
rendering offered by Robert Strini
at the museum entrance.
Nostalgia is summoned in such
works as Howard Hack's "Window
No. 27 Clay and Davis Street
Barber Shop," and Wayne
Thiebaud's "Candy Counter." Wil
liam Wiley's "Lame and Blind in
Eden" mocks the sunny stilllife
innocence of Robert Harvey's
"Landy and Esther in Granada."
In sharing the collection of Mr.
and Mrs. Harry Anderson, the
viewer is rewarded with experienc
ing a varied and provocative
representation of contemporary
California Art. It is considered
one of the major collections of
international modern art, art as a
reflection of life style.
