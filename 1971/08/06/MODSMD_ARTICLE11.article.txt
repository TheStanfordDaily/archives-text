# 'Robin' Doesn't Make It
## Weak Multi-Media Show 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
It isn't terribly easy to criticize
an amateur production in which
many young people have worked
long hours to prepare a struggling
young playwright's product for
the stage. But casting sympathy
aside, some productions are
worthwhile and some like
"Robin" aren't.
A troupe of 18 Stanford
students, graduates and outsiders
compose the ALOTAVUS Theatre
Company which is currently per
forming this play, which was
written by a former Stanford
graduate drama student, Bob
Walter. After sitting through near
ly two hours of their efforts, I
sympathize with what they are
trying to do, but still must report
that the total product falls far
short of success.
Song, dialogue, dance, film and
a light show are combined into
what the company terms a "multi
media extravaganza." Although
the cast is energetic, only a few
people show any great amount of
talent and their strong moments
can in no way make the show
work for me.
One must return to the play
itself as the source of the major
problem. "Robin" follows the life
of the title character from infancy

through early adulthood. Each of
the five "movements" of his life
and the play is filled with all kinds
of problems—social, interpersonal
and psychological.
Director Speaks
In a press release about the
show, director Richard Carp says
"Robin is a personal attempt on
our part to deal with and come
out from our alienation. If there is
any answer in the play, it lies in
the total play as it happens on the
stage, not in a specific statement
within it."
But ironically only a few
statements in the play really
showed me any validity in solving
the problems and the total pro
duction falls entirely short of
triumph. In the end, everyone
removes their masks and clothes
and by being open, frank, "real"
and "one with the peace and love
nation," they try to begin to bring
order to confusion.
I am not trying to put down
that entire philosophy. No one
can deny that our society could
use a lot more love and peace. But
although such a "solution" may
provide mellowness and inner
peace for some, it does little to
really cure many of the social ills I
felt the play focused on.

If Walter were looking only at
one person's problems, perhaps
such a solution would be all that
is needed. The alienated fatherless
boy finally finds peace and
happiness after many years. But
purposely or not, Walter has made
us look at too many general ills to
make the play hinge only on what
happens to little Robin.
Incomplete Solution
Perhaps Robin and his friends
have "got it all together" at the
end. Maybe that's al! Walter
wanted to achieve. But after being
constantly exposed to so many
social ills throughout the play,
such a solution for me is only very
partial at best.
Maybe Walter wants us to
extrapolate to the point where the
happy and peaceful people go out
and turn the world around. But
such a stretching of the imagina
tion is too great for me and when
I have to be reminded of all these
problems with only such an
incomplete solution offered, I am
disappointed.
Admittedly "Robin" might
somehow be developed into some
thing worthwhile. Walter has some
valid ideas about the falseness and
inhumanity of people and the
resulting alienation which other
people feel. But although
"Robin" works now and again to
point him out well, it doesn't
really show me any real probably
successful alternative.
But leaving aside a judgement
of the total "multi-media" pro
duction, most of its parts alone
and the troupe's execution of
them is not too great. Major
problems exist on almost every
level. The songs and music are not
really special. There are a few nice
numbers like "I Want to Fly" and
"Open Your Eyes." But most of
the songs have nothing more than
simple musical progressions and

very predictable and unoriginal
lyrics.
Two of the dance numbers are
quite good—a tap dance sequence
early in the show and a later twist
routine—but they alone cannot
uplift a weak show.
Waste of Film
The films and light show don't
add much to the production. The
films often seem to be thrown
together with little thought or
continuity. For example, where
do pictures of the Town and
Country Billiard Parlor on El
Camino Real fit in with Robin's
infancy.
And Carp's direction has some
major problems. A couple of
times, actors give long dialogues
with their backs to the audience—
a cardinal sin for any company.
And when the poor acoustics in
the Branner Hall Dining Room are
combined with bad placement of
actors, both spoken and sung
words are often very hard to
understand.
There are some good points to
the production of "Robin." A few
of the performers are talented and
handle themselves well. Becky
Daniels as Robin's mother early in
the play, and Scott Hickey as the
grown-up Robin are two who
showed good voices and some
decent acting ability.
The set
designs by Sam Ambler and Jim
Spickard are fairly nice, especially
some giant masks which serve
both as background and late in
the play as very effective masks
for actors.
It's somehow ironic that music
for the show is provided by a
group called the "Palo Alto City
Dump." They are one of the
stronger points of "Robin" and
they show good execution of
what is not the most remarkable
music ever composed.

is needed. The alienated fatherless
boy finally finds peace and
happiness after many years. But
purposely or not, Walter has made
us look at too many general ills to
make the play hinge only on what
happens to little Robin.
Incomplete Solution
Perhaps Robin and his friends
have "got it all together" at the
end. Maybe that's al! Walter
wanted to achieve. But after being
constantly exposed to so many
social ills throughout the play,
such a solution for me is only very
partial at best.
Maybe Walter wants us to
extrapolate to the point where the
happy and peaceful people go out
and turn the world around. But
such a stretching of the imagina
tion is too great for me and when
I have to be reminded of all these
problems with only such an
incomplete solution offered, I am
disappointed.
Admittedly "Robin" might
somehow be developed into some
thing worthwhile. Walter has some
valid ideas about the falseness and
inhumanity of people and the
resulting alienation which other
people feel. But although
"Robin" works now and again to
point him out well, it doesn't
really show me any real probably
successful alternative.
But leaving aside a judgement
of the total "multi-media" pro
duction, most of its parts alone
and the troupe's execution of
them is not too great. Major
problems exist on almost every
level. The songs and music are not
really special. There are a few nice
numbers like "I Want to Fly" and
"Open Your Eyes." But most of
the songs have nothing more than
simple musical progressions and

very predictable and unoriginal
lyrics.
Two of the dance numbers are
quite good—a tap dance sequence
early in the show and a later twist
routine—but they alone cannot
uplift a weak show.
Waste of Film
The films and light show don't
add much to the production. The
films often seem to be thrown
together with little thought or
continuity. For example, where
do pictures of the Town and
Country Billiard Parlor on El
Camino Real fit in with Robin's
infancy.
And Carp's direction has some
major problems. A couple of
times, actors give long dialogues
with their backs to the audience—
a cardinal sin for any company.
And when the poor acoustics in
the Branner Hall Dining Room are
combined with bad placement of
actors, both spoken and sung
words are often very hard to
understand.
There are some good points to
the production of "Robin." A few
of the performers are talented and
handle themselves well. Becky
Daniels as Robin's mother early in
the play, and Scott Hickey as the
grown-up Robin are two who
showed good voices and some
decent acting ability.
The set
designs by Sam Ambler and Jim
Spickard are fairly nice, especially
some giant masks which serve
both as background and late in
the play as very effective masks
for actors.
It's somehow ironic that music
for the show is provided by a
group called the "Palo Alto City
Dump." They are one of the
stronger points of "Robin" and
they show good execution of
what is not the most remarkable
music ever composed.

SAVE ME—The new multi-media production "Robin" is being
performed nightly at 8:30 p.m. in the Branner Hall Dining Room
through Sunday night and then again from August 12-15. Tickets are
$2 for the show which is being put on by the ALOTAVUS Theatre
Company.
It isn't terribly easy to criticize
an amateur production in which
many young people have worked
long hours to prepare a struggling
young playwright's product for
the stage. But casting sympathy
aside, some productions are
worthwhile and some like
"Robin" aren't.
A troupe of 18 Stanford
students, graduates and outsiders
compose the ALOTAVUS Theatre
Company which is currently per
forming this play, which was
written by a former Stanford
graduate drama student, Bob
Walter. After sitting through near
ly two hours of their efforts, I
sympathize with what they are
trying to do, but still must report
that the total product falls far
short of success.
Song, dialogue, dance, film and
a light show are combined into
what the company terms a "multi
media extravaganza." Although
the cast is energetic, only a few
people show any great amount of
talent and their strong moments
can in no way make the show
work for me.
One must return to the play
itself as the source of the major
problem. "Robin" follows the life
of the title character from infancy

through early adulthood. Each of
the five "movements" of his life
and the play is filled with all kinds
of problems—social, interpersonal
and psychological.
Director Speaks
In a press release about the
show, director Richard Carp says
"Robin is a personal attempt on
our part to deal with and come
out from our alienation. If there is
any answer in the play, it lies in
the total play as it happens on the
stage, not in a specific statement
within it."
But ironically only a few
statements in the play really
showed me any validity in solving
the problems and the total pro
duction falls entirely short of
triumph. In the end, everyone
removes their masks and clothes
and by being open, frank, "real"
and "one with the peace and love
nation," they try to begin to bring
order to confusion.
I am not trying to put down
that entire philosophy. No one
can deny that our society could
use a lot more love and peace. But
although such a "solution" may
provide mellowness and inner
peace for some, it does little to
really cure many of the social ills I
felt the play focused on.

If Walter were looking only at
one person's problems, perhaps
such a solution would be all that
is needed. The alienated fatherless
boy finally finds peace and
happiness after many years. But
purposely or not, Walter has made

There are some good points to
the production of "Robin." A few

Daniels as Robin's mother early in

The set

some giant masks which serve
both as background and late in

It's somehow ironic that music

SAVE ME—The new multi-media production "Robin" is being
performed nightly at 8:30 p.m. in the Branner Hall Dining Room
through Sunday night and then again from August 12-15. Tickets are
$2 for the show which is being put on by the ALOTAVUS Theatre
Company.
It isn't terribly easy to criticize
an amateur production in which
many young people have worked
long hours to prepare a struggling
young playwright's product for
the stage. But casting sympathy
aside, some productions are
worthwhile and some like
"Robin" aren't.
A troupe of 18 Stanford
students, graduates and outsiders
compose the ALOTAVUS Theatre
Company which is currently per
forming this play, which was
written by a former Stanford
graduate drama student, Bob
Walter. After sitting through near
ly two hours of their efforts, I
sympathize with what they are
trying to do, but still must report
that the total product falls far
short of success.
Song, dialogue, dance, film and
a light show are combined into
what the company terms a "multi
media extravaganza." Although
the cast is energetic, only a few
people show any great amount of
talent and their strong moments
can in no way make the show
work for me.
One must return to the play
itself as the source of the major
problem. "Robin" follows the life
of the title character from infancy

through early adulthood. Each of
the five "movements" of his life
and the play is filled with all kinds
of problems—social, interpersonal
and psychological.
Director Speaks
In a press release about the
show, director Richard Carp says
"Robin is a personal attempt on
our part to deal with and come
out from our alienation. If there is
any answer in the play, it lies in
the total play as it happens on the
stage, not in a specific statement
within it."
But ironically only a few
statements in the play really
showed me any validity in solving
the problems and the total pro
duction falls entirely short of
triumph. In the end, everyone
removes their masks and clothes
and by being open, frank, "real"
and "one with the peace and love
nation," they try to begin to bring
order to confusion.
I am not trying to put down
that entire philosophy. No one
can deny that our society could
use a lot more love and peace. But
although such a "solution" may
provide mellowness and inner
peace for some, it does little to
really cure many of the social ills I
felt the play focused on.

If Walter were looking only at
one person's problems, perhaps
such a solution would be all that
is needed. The alienated fatherless
boy finally finds peace and
happiness after many years. But
purposely or not, Walter has made
us look at too many general ills to
make the play hinge only on what
happens to little Robin.
Incomplete Solution
Perhaps Robin and his friends
have "got it all together" at the
end. Maybe that's al! Walter
wanted to achieve. But after being
constantly exposed to so many
social ills throughout the play,
such a solution for me is only very
partial at best.
Maybe Walter wants us to
extrapolate to the point where the
happy and peaceful people go out
and turn the world around. But
such a stretching of the imagina
tion is too great for me and when
I have to be reminded of all these
problems with only such an
incomplete solution offered, I am
disappointed.
Admittedly "Robin" might
somehow be developed into some
thing worthwhile. Walter has some
valid ideas about the falseness and
inhumanity of people and the
resulting alienation which other
people feel. But although
"Robin" works now and again to
point him out well, it doesn't
really show me any real probably
successful alternative.
But leaving aside a judgement
of the total "multi-media" pro
duction, most of its parts alone
and the troupe's execution of
them is not too great. Major
problems exist on almost every
level. The songs and music are not
really special. There are a few nice
numbers like "I Want to Fly" and
"Open Your Eyes." But most of
the songs have nothing more than
simple musical progressions and

very predictable and unoriginal
lyrics.
Two of the dance numbers are
quite good—a tap dance sequence
early in the show and a later twist
routine—but they alone cannot
uplift a weak show.
Waste of Film
The films and light show don't
add much to the production. The
films often seem to be thrown
together with little thought or
continuity. For example, where
do pictures of the Town and
Country Billiard Parlor on El
Camino Real fit in with Robin's
infancy.
And Carp's direction has some
major problems. A couple of
times, actors give long dialogues
with their backs to the audience—
a cardinal sin for any company.
And when the poor acoustics in
the Branner Hall Dining Room are
combined with bad placement of
actors, both spoken and sung
words are often very hard to
understand.
There are some good points to
the production of "Robin." A few
of the performers are talented and
handle themselves well. Becky
Daniels as Robin's mother early in
