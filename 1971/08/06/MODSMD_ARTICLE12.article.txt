# 'The Physicists'
## Strong Summer Production 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment, in its only production of
the Summer Quarter, is presenting
an excellent production of Fried
rich Durrenmatt's "The Physi
cists." The play runs only through
tomorrow night, at the Nitery,
with an admission price of $1.00.
Durrenmatt is a German play
wright and author whose work is
under produced in this country.
"The Physicists" combines wit,
philosophy, and murder in a

blissfully short 90 minutes which
never drags, never bores, never
makes you sorry you ever got into
the habit of going to the theater.
Perhaps that's why I think
Durrenmatt is such a first-rate
fellow.
Insane Asylum
The play is about three inmates
of an insane asylum, all of whom
were physicists in real life, and
each of whom has an interesting
delusion. One is convinced he is
Einstein, another thinks he is Sir
Isaac Newton, and the third
converses with King Solomon.
The first two have also developed
a nasty habit: they like to strangle
their nurses.
Durrenmatt avoids the cliche
of guessing who is crazier, the
patient or his psychiatrist. The
psychiatrist, Fraulein Dr. Mathilde
Von Zahnd, is obviously a bit
crackers herself. The only sane
people seem to be the nurses, and
they keep getting killed.
The play slowly develops into
an interesting drama in which the
central theme is the social respon
sibility of the physicist (and, by
implication, all scientists), in a
world which tends to use scientif

ic discoveries to implement Arma
geddon.
Bruce Pribram has the central
role of Johan Wilhelm Mabius, the
gentleman who talks to King
Solomon, while Jerry Post plays
Herbert Georg Beutler, in a
Newtonian frock coat and wig,
and Bob Ayres plays Ernst Hein
rich Ernesti, a soft-spoken, fuzzy
haired Einstein.
Good Actress
The eccentric Fraulein Dr.
Mathilde Von Zahnd is played by
Robbi Levitow, one of a few
actresses at Stanford who can
really act. This time Miss Levitow
is the prototype German spinster
psychiatrist, a hump-backed Lotta
Lenya, hair tied back, cigar in her
mouth, and an accent you could
slice and eat with your knock

worst.
Director Mary Geldard has
taken these four fine actors, along
with a host of supporting players,
and used them to create an
entirely sane fantasy world. Scene
Designer Wendell Cole has render
ed considerable assistance by
transforming the Nitery (a mad
place to begin with) into a homey,
Mittel European insane asylum.
One minor complaint (which is
likely to affect only such purists
as myself) is that the actor who
plays a cigar-smoking police in
spector doesn't really know how
to smoke a cigar. He should
practice more.
Tickets are sold only at the
door. The theater is small, and
tends to sell-out, so arrive early.
It's a good show, and I would
encourage you to see it.

sibility of the physicist (and, by
implication, all scientists), in a
world which tends to use scientif

ic discoveries to implement Arma
geddon.
Bruce Pribram has the central
role of Johan Wilhelm Mabius, the
gentleman who talks to King
Solomon, while Jerry Post plays
Herbert Georg Beutler, in a
Newtonian frock coat and wig,
and Bob Ayres plays Ernst Hein
rich Ernesti, a soft-spoken, fuzzy
haired Einstein.
Good Actress
The eccentric Fraulein Dr.
Mathilde Von Zahnd is played by
Robbi Levitow, one of a few
actresses at Stanford who can
really act. This time Miss Levitow
is the prototype German spinster
psychiatrist, a hump-backed Lotta
Lenya, hair tied back, cigar in her
mouth, and an accent you could
slice and eat with your knock

worst.
Director Mary Geldard has
taken these four fine actors, along
with a host of supporting players,
and used them to create an
entirely sane fantasy world. Scene
Designer Wendell Cole has render
ed considerable assistance by
transforming the Nitery (a mad
place to begin with) into a homey,
Mittel European insane asylum.
One minor complaint (which is
likely to affect only such purists
as myself) is that the actor who
plays a cigar-smoking police in
spector doesn't really know how
to smoke a cigar. He should
practice more.
Tickets are sold only at the
door. The theater is small, and
tends to sell-out, so arrive early.
It's a good show, and I would
encourage you to see it.

SING ALONG—Stanford Summer Chorus soloists (left to right) Marc Clemens, Kari Windingstad,
Anthony Antolini and Pamela Erickson are seen rehearsing with director William Wells at the keyboard.
The chorus will give a free concert tonight at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel Auditorium, featuring works by the
late Igor Stravinsky.
The Stanford Drama Depart
ment, in its only production of
the Summer Quarter, is presenting
an excellent production of Fried
rich Durrenmatt's "The Physi
cists." The play runs only through
tomorrow night, at the Nitery,
with an admission price of $1.00.
Durrenmatt is a German play
wright and author whose work is
under produced in this country.
"The Physicists" combines wit,
philosophy, and murder in a

blissfully short 90 minutes which
never drags, never bores, never
makes you sorry you ever got into
the habit of going to the theater.
Perhaps that's why I think
Durrenmatt is such a first-rate
fellow.
Insane Asylum
The play is about three inmates
of an insane asylum, all of whom
were physicists in real life, and
each of whom has an interesting
delusion. One is convinced he is
Einstein, another thinks he is Sir
Isaac Newton, and the third
converses with King Solomon.
The first two have also developed
a nasty habit: they like to strangle
their nurses.
Durrenmatt avoids the cliche
of guessing who is crazier, the
patient or his psychiatrist. The
psychiatrist, Fraulein Dr. Mathilde
Von Zahnd, is obviously a bit
crackers herself. The only sane
people seem to be the nurses, and
they keep getting killed.
The play slowly develops into
an interesting drama in which the
central theme is the social respon
sibility of the physicist (and, by
implication, all scientists), in a
world which tends to use scientif

ic discoveries to implement Arma
geddon.
