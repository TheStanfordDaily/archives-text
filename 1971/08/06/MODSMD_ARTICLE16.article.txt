# The
						Crisis Within'
## Alums Back For Confab 
### VICKI PERRIS 
The sixth annual Summer
Alumni Conference entitled, "The
Crisis Within," is being held this
week with over 240 alumni
returning to campus for the
ten-day session.
The conference is under the
direction of Professor Lewis W.
Spitz. With him on the faculty are
professors Albert H. Hastorf, a
psychology professor and dean of
the School of Humanities and
Sciences, David M. Kennedy,
assistant professor of History, and
Robert McAfee Brown, professor
of religion.
Format is varied, and includes
lectures, seminars, and discus
sions. David Harris, a former
Stanford student body president,
returned to give a lecture Monday
and Eileen Hernandez, the pres
ident of the National Organization
for Women, will speak this evening.
Although Professor Hastorf
says that the returning students

are "extremely receptive," at a
discussion Thursday afternoon
about the merits of alternative
lifestyles, many of the returnees
showed skepticism about this
mode of living. Jane Laird, a
brightly dressed alumnus, com
mented after the discussion that
. . people who believe that the
alternative life style will work
completely are being very naive."
"I hadn't realized how much
things had changed," said one
alumnus (class of *45). "Both the
campus itself and the things that
are taking place here are 'radical
ly' different then when I was
here."
The alumni got a chance to
talk with students who are cur
rently enrolled several times dur
ing the week, once at a discussion
of the proposed urban campus for
Stanford, and again at the discus
sion on alternative life styles.
Conference members are most
ly from California, although some
are from out of state, and some

come from outside of the U.S.
The American counsul general in
Rome, John L. Kuhn, graduated
from Stanford 36 years ago—and
is now back for the conference.
Some are recent graduates, but
the bulk of the returning students
graduated over ten years ago.
Their reasons vary also. Some
want to "get back in touch" with
what is happening in the world
today, and some came back
because of nostalgia.

Visiting alumni will be taking a
cinematic LSD trip today because
of two San Francisco artists who
advocate the use of "acid."
Fred Wolf and Norman Miller
of the Project Artaud artists'
cooperative drove down from the
city yesterday after they read
about the Summer Alumni Con
ference and its exploration of
current issues.
Wolf pointed to the alumni's
Wednesday night program on drug
use, which included a film on
heroin addiction. He said the
visitors should also view his film,
which advocates "the use of acid
in a supportive setting as a way to
enlightenment."
Wolf said his 1967 film shows
"80 people on acid at one time
having a Garden of Eden scene."
And he said the "highlight
shows a young girl taking her first
acid trip and achieving Nirvana."
But he added casual usage is an
"abuse" of LSD.
Mrs. Sheila Cahill, coordinator
of the conference, first told the
artists it was too late to add them
to the busy and "exhausting"
program the alumni are pursuing.
But after viewing the 90-min
ute film, she agreed to show half
of it this afternoon at 4:30 p.m.
in Jordan Hall, Room 040.
She said it would be an
"interesting experience" for the
visitors. Wolf will be on hand to
answer the alumni's questions
about their "first trip."
