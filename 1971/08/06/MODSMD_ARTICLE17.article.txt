# Officials Review Police Power Idea
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Deputizing University police
under the Sheriff's department
was the major plan discussed
Wednesday as Santa Clara Coun
ty's Sheriff and University admin
istrators considered alternatives
for the future of Stanford's
campus police.
Sheriff James Geary, new cam
pus police chief Marvin L. Her
rington, and Presidential Assistant
John Schwartz compared idear to
give full police powers to the
University's limited security force.
Geary yesterday denied press
reports that he had suggested
deputizing all Stanford police,
insisting such a plan would only

apply to a small part of the
campus force.
Campus administrators report
edly objected to the control
Geary would have over those
campus police he deputized.
Geary said Stanford's chief Her
rington could supervise the day
to-day activities of the deputized
officers.
But the sheriff said that Her
rington "would have to be more
or less under my control to a
degree" in matters of policy
concerning the deputies.
Stanford officers—who now
lack arrest powers and other full
police capabilities—would have to
qualify under state "peace of
ficer" standards before being
deputized, according to Geary.
This weekend, Geary will send
Undersheriff Tom Rosa to Har
vard, Yale, and Cornell univer
sities to study their campus police
forces.
A Stanford-initiated bill that
would allow the University to
operate an independent full
powered police force apparently
stands little chance of passage in
this session of the state legislature.
Meanwhile, former campus
police chief Thomas Bell, who
resigned in April, was this week
named security chief at San
Francisco's well-known Ghiradelli
Square shopping center.
