NEW STAFF ORIENTATION
Personnel officials will give new employees clearer
information about grievance procedures because of
charges this week by student official Diane Fields.
Fields, a member of the Council of Presidents,
went Tuesday morning to an orientation session for
new University employees. She said she was checking
out reports the employees were not told how to lodge
a complaint. The grievance procedure became
controversial this summer after five employees were
fired.
Benefits supervisor Dudley Bennett confirmed her
charge that his weekly speech to the employees had
included no mention of grievance procedures.
Although the procedures were included in a package
given the new workers, Bennett conceded that not
even he has ever read all the literature in the bulky
orientation envelope.
Bennett said he had not been mentioning grievance
procedures because his work covers only health and
insurance benefits. He explained that an employment
office representative—who would handle such topics
as grievances—had stopped participating in the
sessions several years ago.
New Employment Manager Mark Rosenfeld
promised the grievance plan will be explained in the
orientation sessions beginning next week. He added
that he plans to revamp the entire orientation
program in the near future.
NEW OMBUDSWOMAN
Lois S. Amsterdam has been appointed the
University's Ombudsman for the 1971-72 academic
year. She will serve the community to receive,
examine and channel complaints in an attempt to
obtain speedy and impartial redress.
Amsterdam is a lawyer with extensive experience as
a social worker and as director of the Law Reform
Unit of the Legal Aid Society in San Mateo County.

Referring to her past experience in negotiation, she
states "I hope to be able to successfully employ that
aspect of my legal experience in my new position."
In making the appointment, Provost Miller said,
"Amsterdam is an outstanding choice; she has the
human qualities which are essential to the position of
Ombudsman. Her interest in people and in the
institution will allow her, I believe, to be very
instrumental in helping the University serve the
people within it."
LYMANS RETURN
Combining business and pleasure, President and
Mrs. Richard W. Lyman have spent the last six weeks
circling the globe. Leaving San Francisco on June 23,
the Lyman's spent two weeks in Japan attending the
International Institute of Education Conference.
On July 4, they flew to Copenhagen, their jumping
off point for a tour of the overseas campuses as well
as a vacation. Their itinerary includes Copenhagen,
Venice, Paris and London in addition to the
campuses. Lyman and his wife are expected to return
to Stanford today.
NEW FIRE RATING
The Pacific Fire Rating Bureau has regraded
Stanford's fire rating for the first time since 1946 and
raised the University from a Class 5 to a Class 4 on a
scale of 10. Palo Alto is rated Class 3; Los Altos and
Sunnyvale are Class 4, according to Stanford Fire
Chief Frank Jurian. The new survey was done at the
request of fire insurance companies, he added.
The new rating applies to the academic and
residential areas as well as to SLAC. The foothills,
which are mainly grasslands and as such uninsured,

were rated Class 9. This is standard for areas without
a water system or fire hydrants.
PEOPLE'S PLAZA
About 20 trash containers were set on fire
Wednesday night at a "People's Plaza" concert in
downtown Palo Alto at what was formerly Lytton
Plaza. The police asked the band to stop playing
when the situation seemed serious and the band
complied.
In addition to the fires, the plaza area was strewn
with broken bottles and light fixtures, according to
police reports. Slogans urging "Revolution" and "kill
the pigs" were painted on the planters.
NEW UNION?
At its 45th statewide conference the California
School Employees Association adopted a resolution
which would open the way for a CSEA chapter at
Stanford.
Although the CSEA has maintained that its
membership was open to employees of private
schools, there has been some question as to whether
the National Labor Relations Act applies to private
institutions. The NLRB held hearings last Fall and the
CSEA states that, "it appears certain that the NLRB
will assume jurisdiction at Stanford." A ruling is
expected this Fall.
COMPUTER AWARDS
Stanford professors John McCarthy and Donald K.
Knuth won awards for their contributions to
computer science at the annual conference of the
Association for Computing Machinery in Chicago.
Professor McCarthy won the A.M. Turing Award
for his work in the field of computers. Prof. Knuth
was named the recipient of the Grace Murray Hopper
Award for distinguished achievement by a young
professional in computers.
