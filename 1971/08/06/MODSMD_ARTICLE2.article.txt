# Grand Jury Witness Appears, Refuses To Answer Questions
## 
### LARRY LIEBERT 
Contra Costa College student Linda
Reynolds yesterday told a federal grand
jury in San Francisco that she will not
answer questions about alleged illegal
explosives unless government agents
reveal whether they used wiretaps in
investigating her.
While Reynolds, 20, appeared before
the closed grand jury in the Federal
Building, about 200 radicals marched
outside to protest her being sub
poenaed. Demonstrators, mostly mem
bers of Venceremos and the Revolu
tionary Union, chanted, "Free Sister
Linda, stop the grand jury."
Reynolds' subpoena last week
prompted widespread reports—both
from radicals and sources close to
intelligence agencies—that a compre
hensive investigation of Bay Area
radical activities is underway.
But Reynolds and her attorney,
Frank Pestana, said they did not believe
the investigation involving her was part
of a broader probe.
Reynolds was arrested April 5 in a
Richmond house where police said they
found dynamite and marijuana. The
dynamite charges were later dropped.

and Pestana insisted, "She's not an
involved person" in radical causes.
Called Back
The grand jury has called Reynolds
back for a Sept. 9 appearance.
Reynolds gave the jury only her
name and address, Pestana said after
yesterday's session. After that she
demanded to know if "any wiretapping
or other illegal means" were used to
gather evidence for her subpoena,
according to the lawyer.
He said that when she was told she
had no right to challenge the investiga
tive methods, she refused to answer
further questions.
No Responsibility
Pestana said, "She had no responsi
bility to participate in an investigation
based on illegality." He said he had
information that illegal methods were
used but gave no details.
Reynolds stepped outside the jury
room after every question to ask
Pestana's advice, he said. Not even
lawyers are allowed to accompany
those subpoenaed into grand jury
courtrooms.
Pestana, who addressed the rally,

charged grand jury investigations have
been "bastardized." He said U.S.
attorneys use the juries "to avoid the
usual procedure of a preliminary
hearing," which requires more solid
evidence.
Personal Aquaintance
Revolutionary Union member Sue
Garrett—a friend of Reynolds—told the
Daily that Reynolds' association with
RU was through personal acquaintances
rather than political activism. She said
Reynolds' only activism has been
advocacy of a nursery project in which
her 4-year-old daughter would partici
pate.
Garrett said police had alleged that
Reynolds had furnished dynamite to
her and another RU member. But she
denied those allegations and said such
charges were never filed.
Although an RU collective was
"busted" the same day, Garrett said no
RU members lived in the house where
Reynolds was arrested.
Reynolds never appeared before the
protestors, but she was aware her friend
Garrett had helped to organize the
protest, Garrett said.

outside to protest her being sub
poenaed. Demonstrators, mostly mem
bers of Venceremos and the Revolu
tionary Union, chanted, "Free Sister
Linda, stop the grand jury."
Reynolds' subpoena last week
prompted widespread reports—both
from radicals and sources close to
intelligence agencies—that a compre
hensive investigation of Bay Area
radical activities is underway.
But Reynolds and her attorney,
Frank Pestana, said they did not believe
the investigation involving her was part
of a broader probe.
Reynolds was arrested April 5 in a
Richmond house where police said they
found dynamite and marijuana. The
dynamite charges were later dropped.

and Pestana insisted, "She's not an
involved person" in radical causes.
Called Back
The grand jury has called Reynolds
back for a Sept. 9 appearance.
Reynolds gave the jury only her
name and address, Pestana said after
yesterday's session. After that she
demanded to know if "any wiretapping
or other illegal means" were used to
gather evidence for her subpoena,
according to the lawyer.
He said that when she was told she
had no right to challenge the investiga
tive methods, she refused to answer
further questions.
No Responsibility
Pestana said, "She had no responsi
bility to participate in an investigation
based on illegality." He said he had
information that illegal methods were
used but gave no details.
Reynolds stepped outside the jury
room after every question to ask
Pestana's advice, he said. Not even
lawyers are allowed to accompany
those subpoenaed into grand jury
courtrooms.
Pestana, who addressed the rally,

charged grand jury investigations have
been "bastardized." He said U.S.
attorneys use the juries "to avoid the
usual procedure of a preliminary
hearing," which requires more solid
evidence.
Personal Aquaintance
Revolutionary Union member Sue
Garrett—a friend of Reynolds—told the
Daily that Reynolds' association with
RU was through personal acquaintances
rather than political activism. She said
Reynolds' only activism has been
advocacy of a nursery project in which
her 4-year-old daughter would partici
pate.
Garrett said police had alleged that
Reynolds had furnished dynamite to
her and another RU member. But she
denied those allegations and said such
charges were never filed.
Although an RU collective was
"busted" the same day, Garrett said no
RU members lived in the house where
Reynolds was arrested.
Reynolds never appeared before the
protestors, but she was aware her friend
Garrett had helped to organize the
protest, Garrett said.
Contra Costa College student Linda
Reynolds yesterday told a federal grand
jury in San Francisco that she will not
answer questions about alleged illegal
explosives unless government agents
reveal whether they used wiretaps in
investigating her.
While Reynolds, 20, appeared before
the closed grand jury in the Federal
Building, about 200 radicals marched
outside to protest her being sub
poenaed. Demonstrators, mostly mem
bers of Venceremos and the Revolu
tionary Union, chanted, "Free Sister
Linda, stop the grand jury."
