# Dolly's Hearing Resumes After Two Week Delay
## 
### 
The grievance hearing for John
Dolly, one of five hospital workers
fired for alleged participation in the
April 9 hospital sit-in, resumes today at
3 p.m. in room 82 of the graduate
school of business after a two week
delay occasioned by the resignation of
H. Kieth H. Brodie, the administration
appointed chairman of the hearing
board.
Before the start of the hearing, the
board, with newly appointed chairman
Byron Sher, Professor of Law, will have
to rule on the validity of a ruling by
Provost and Acting President William
Miller prohibiting suspended Assoc.
Prof. Bruce Franklin from serving as
Dolly's grievance representative.
At a meeting yesterday with Frank
lin and Dolly, the grievance board
heard arguments on the Franklin issue
and also announced several changes in
the procedural outlook of the board.
"What is disturbing me," John Dolly
commented about the changes, "is that
Sher is dropping all the legal safeguards.
He says hearsay evidence will be
allowed, which means that anyone can
say anybody accused me of anything,
and I can't get to question my accuser.
Even worse than that, Sher said that it
isn't necessary for Nelson to prove me
guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. It
sounded to me like he was saying that
since Nelson is the boss and this isn't a
court of law, all he has to prove in
order to fire me is that he had good
reason to suspect me."
In response to a request for
clarification of his grievance, Dolly
presented a detailed letter claiming
mistreatment at the hands of the
University Personnel department.

In describing the nature of the
grievance which he filed after being
fired, Doily maintains that:
—Assuming Nelson will present his
testimony as he did during the initial,
aborted, hearing, the primary focus of
the grievance will be the inconclusive
nature of the evidence, much of which
is hearsay.
—"Unacceptable behavior," as used
by the Personnel Director as the reason
for firing him, is an unnecessarily vague
term.
—Nelson has produced no conclusive
evidence as to "unacceptable behavior'
at the sit-in.
—At no point did Nelson present
any evidence before Dolly was fired.
Dolly explained that when he initially
visited Nelson and asked him for the
evidence which led to his being fired,
he was told that the evidence could not
be disclosed to him.
—By firing him before the comple
tion of his pending criminal case, Dolly
is being forced to expose his court
defense.
—University guide memo 22.8 re
quires that an intended dismissal for
cause be reviewed by the director of
personnel. This review did not take
place because it was Nelson, and not his
supervisor, who originally fired Dolly.
—Research work in the department
where he worked was disrupted when
Dolly was given only one day's notice
of his firing.
Dolly is asking for remedial action
which would include restoration of his
employee status, payment of lost
salary, and a letter of apology from
Nelson for his refusal to follow proper
procedures in the case.
