# SWOPSI Project Released
## Report Documents DOD Research 
### PAT STANFORD 
"Over 20 percent of the Department
of Defense sponsored research activity
at this university is directed toward
solving phenomena that do have direct
military importance," stated Stanton
A. Glantz, in a news conference
yesterday discussing the recent publica
tion of a SWOPSI report on Defense
Department research funding at Stan
ford.
Glantz, a doctoral candidate in
applied mechanics who headed the
student research project, explained that

"the university is very deeply engrossed
in militarist activities because a substan
tial amount of funds have been
available from the Army and the Air
Force to conduct fundamental re
search."
Volume I of the report, entitled
"Two Perceptions: The Investigator's
and the Sponsor's," contains a project
by-project description of over 100
DOD sponsored activities as of Febru
ary 9, 1971.
The study was originated as a
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on Social
and Political Issues) project last March
when Glantz, who is a student member
of tiie University Committee on Re
search, failed to convince the Commit
tee to undertake such a study on its
own. Glantz's motivation was to get
"people who knew about technology- to
study and publish these documents and

to provide a fairly honest appraisal of
the work."
Another member of the research
project, physics student Carol A.
Farlow, suggested that, "The university
has turned into a corporation that sells
a product—research, and this report
explains the details of that approach."
When questioned about the emphasis in
the report on Defense Department
work, she observed that the "DOD has
the most technological projects, and
they have a long history of financing
technical work that can be used in
military operations."
Individual Descriptions
The individual project descriptions
in the SWOPSI report were based on
the proposals submitted by the princi
pal investigator, the current contract, a
questionaire answered by the investiga

tor, and (in most cases) a summary of
research work prepared by the Techni
cal Monitor in the DOD.
In addition, the principal investiga
tor for each project was given an
opportunity to preview the report and
have his comments included in the final
version. According to Glantz, fewer
than ten percent of the investigators
chose to exercise this option, and most
of these made only minor revisions to
the descriptions prepared by the group.
As indicated by the title of the
SWOPSI report, the nature of contract
research as stated at the university
often differs from the description filed
with the DOD sponsor. For example,
Glantz cited a medical school project
sponsored by the USAF School of
Aerospace Medicine.
