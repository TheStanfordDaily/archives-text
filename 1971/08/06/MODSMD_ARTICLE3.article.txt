# SWOPSI Project Released
## Report Documents DOD Research 
### PAT STANFORD 
"Over 20 percent of the Department
of Defense sponsored research activity
at this university is directed toward
solving phenomena that do have direct
military importance," stated Stanton
A. Glantz, in a news conference
yesterday discussing the recent publica
tion of a SWOPSI report on Defense
Department research funding at Stan
ford.
Glantz, a doctoral candidate in
applied mechanics who headed the
student research project, explained that

"the university is very deeply engrossed
in militarist activities because a substan
tial amount of funds have been
available from the Army and the Air
Force to conduct fundamental re
search."
Volume I of the report, entitled
"Two Perceptions: The Investigator's
and the Sponsor's," contains a project
by-project description of over 100
DOD sponsored activities as of Febru
ary 9, 1971.
The study was originated as a
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshop on Social
and Political Issues) project last March
when Glantz, who is a student member
of tiie University Committee on Re
search, failed to convince the Commit
tee to undertake such a study on its
own. Glantz's motivation was to get
"people who knew about technology- to
study and publish these documents and

to provide a fairly honest appraisal of
the work."
Another member of the research
project, physics student Carol A.
Farlow, suggested that, "The university
has turned into a corporation that sells
a product—research, and this report
explains the details of that approach."
When questioned about the emphasis in
the report on Defense Department
work, she observed that the "DOD has
the most technological projects, and
they have a long history of financing
technical work that can be used in
military operations."
Individual Descriptions
The individual project descriptions
in the SWOPSI report were based on
the proposals submitted by the princi
pal investigator, the current contract, a
questionaire answered by the investiga

tor, and (in most cases) a summary of
research work prepared by the Techni
cal Monitor in the DOD.
In addition, the principal investiga
tor for each project was given an
opportunity to preview the report and
have his comments included in the final
version. According to Glantz, fewer
than ten percent of the investigators
chose to exercise this option, and most
of these made only minor revisions to
the descriptions prepared by the group.
As indicated by the title of the
SWOPSI report, the nature of contract
research as stated at the university
often differs from the description filed
with the DOD sponsor. For example,
Glantz cited a medical school project
sponsored by the USAF School of
Aerospace Medicine.

THE BEM'S WILL GET YOU-That's science fiction jargon for Bug Eyed Monster. BEM's, along with some of the more
sophisticated features of science fiction, are the subject of serious study in the Science Eiction Institute.
The university's contract title is
"Thresholds for Permanent Functional
Visual Damage in Humans using Visible
Radiation," while the government's
title was "Aircrew Visual Impair
ment/Injury thresholds from Nuclear
Weapons."
Glantz commented that "the faculty
was fairly cooperative in our work, but
none of the professors at Stanford
knew about the differences in titles.
"The central reason for the differ
ence in names of the projects was to
clarify to members of the Congress the
need for defense research in that
particular area."
Social Sciences Also
Although most of the contracts
sponsored by the Defense Department
are technologically oriented, the DOD
also supports work in the social
sciences. One such project at the
Hoover Institution is entitled "Re

search on Political Fragmentation and
Regional Viability of Mainland China."
According to the SWOPSI summary,
"the objective of this work is to assess
political developments in Mainland
China during the period which will
follow Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao."
While the report of the SWOPSI
group contains primarily descriptive
material about current research activi
ties, members of the SWOPSI group
suggested various changes which they
thought should be made in the
relationship between Stanford and the
Defense Department.
One proposal suggested by the
committee was to minimize the direct
dependence of graduate students and
professors on DOD contracts for
financial support.
Changes in Funding Needed
Currently, many professors receive
much of their salary from income

provided by the contracts which they
are able to obtain. Graduate students
are often hired to work on particular
projects rather than receiving indepen
dent support. The committee recog
nized, however, that such changes
would probably have to occur in
Federal funding policies before they
could be implemented at Stanford.
Glantz cautioned, however, that he
was "hesitant to make strong state
ments about the information [in the
report] until we have studied it more;
and that will come via the analysis in
Volume II."
The second part of the SWOPSI
report—the committee's analysis and
reaction to the information in the first
part—is due to be completed in
November.
Reaction to this first part of the
committee's report has been mixed.
New Left Project members issued a
statement saying, "This report, with its
bulk and its detailed information,

constitutes prima facie evidence for
what Stanford radicals have been
arguing for six years: that Stanford is a
federal-grant university tied to U.S. war
efforts. None of this research should be
done anywhere, including Stanford."
Professor William R. Rambo, Di
rector of the Stanford Electronics
Laboratory, called the report "com
pletely laudable, a singular service to
the community, that will allow it to
base discussions on fact, not on
emotions. A very real contribution."
However Dr. Rambo was disturbed
to see the discussion "move so quickly
into the interpretive phase."
Professor Alan T. Waterman, Jr. of
the Department of Electrical Engineer
ing felt that "this is a group trying to
do an objective study. But the leader of
the group expressed his opinion openly
before the study started, and it seems
his opinion is the same now."
Copies of the report are available at
the SWOPSI office for $5.00.
