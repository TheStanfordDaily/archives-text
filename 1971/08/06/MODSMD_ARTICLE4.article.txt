# Sci Fi-Medium For Speculation
## 
### DICK GEIKIE 
Commentary
Do you believe, "We are what we think our future
is?" The members of the Institute for Science Fiction
and Fantasy are convinced of it.
Grouped under the Graduate Division of Special
Program the Science Fiction Institute consists of
four courses in various aspects of science fiction and
fantasy. But what is science fiction?
A. Berkley Driessel, Assistant to the Provost and
Lecturer in General Studies, suggests, "Science fiction
is that body of extrapolative literature which has
some basis in current scientific fact." Regarded as
more than twenty first century cowboys and indians,
science fiction is a medium for speculation on
science, politics, social systems, education, and the
nature of being human.
"The focus of the institute," says Driessel, "is
hypothesis or model building. Science fiction is a
vehicle for exploring the consequences of various
social and technological changes by building models
of tomorrow which are metaphors that allow a
commonality of inquiry. We build a common frame
of reference through science fiction, making it
possible for a sociologist to view the co- quences of
a biological development without ht. g any real
expertise in the biological sciences."

Driessel emphasized the interdisciplinary potential
of the Institute: "We see its function within the
University as a vehicle by which students from
various fields can integrate their quite different types
of specialized knowledge by imaginative considera
tion of the future, or by imaginative consideration of
other non-reality contexts."
Arthur Hastings, Assistant Professor of Public
Address and Small Group Communication, feels that
science fiction, "is based in plausible social and
technical concepts. You can lake an idea, expand it
to a plausible end and by suspending belief in normal
reality, play with the concept."
"Dealing with the improbable-plausible," is one
way Driessel feels science fiction affords technical
and social speculation. "It's possible for there to be
scientific break throughs that effect our way of life or
very existence; in cybernetics or neurology for
example. How would we respond to a totally
automated society or what if we could alter the
learning segments of the DNA molecule to allow
instant learning with photographic memories. Science
fiction makes it possible to extrapolate any such idea
to a plausible conclusion."
Resides supposing the consequences of particular
technological or social actions, Hastings feels, "we
can learn what it means to be human. By
hypothesizing how we would react to different forms
of alien life, we get a greater insight as to how we

should relate to other humans."
There are several different bases from which a
science fiction writer can work. One is the Robert
Heinlein style question, "If this goes on, then
what?" That is to take a current situation or trend
and then postulate possible ends if we continue in
such a manner.
Another basis for science fiction writing, according
to Driessel, is the, "alternate future or time flow
technique. What if the Spanish Armada had won? It is
interesting to then trace the consequences of such a
reversal on world actions" . . . How well do you speak
Spanish?
"Of late," says Hastings, "there seems to be a
trend away from the technical preoccupation of the
past, to the sociological consequences of specific
actions." Many of the noted science fiction writers,
such as Issac Assamov, Robert Heinlein, Arthur Clark,
and Stanford guest lecturer Curt Siodmak. come from
scientific backgrounds. According to Driessel, "Many
science fiction writers now come from the humani
ties."
Science fiction today is starting a "new wave," but
the questions explored are still intriguing. Could our
violent natures be caused by extraterestrial influ
ences? How will the population crisis end'' Can a
democratic government survive? Could dnigs end all
hostility in the world?
What if . ..?

reality, play with the concept."
"Dealing with the improbable-plausible," is one
way Driessel feels science fiction affords technical
and social speculation. "It's possible for there to be
scientific break throughs that effect our way of life or
very existence; in cybernetics or neurology for
example. How would we respond to a totally
automated society or what if we could alter the
learning segments of the DNA molecule to allow
instant learning with photographic memories. Science
fiction makes it possible to extrapolate any such idea
to a plausible conclusion."
Resides supposing the consequences of particular
technological or social actions, Hastings feels, "we
can learn what it means to be human. By
hypothesizing how we would react to different forms
of alien life, we get a greater insight as to how we

should relate to other humans."
There are several different bases from which a
science fiction writer can work. One is the Robert
Heinlein style question, "If this goes on, then
what?" That is to take a current situation or trend
and then postulate possible ends if we continue in
such a manner.
Another basis for science fiction writing, according
to Driessel, is the, "alternate future or time flow
technique. What if the Spanish Armada had won? It is
interesting to then trace the consequences of such a
reversal on world actions" . . . How well do you speak
Spanish?
"Of late," says Hastings, "there seems to be a
trend away from the technical preoccupation of the
past, to the sociological consequences of specific
actions." Many of the noted science fiction writers,
such as Issac Assamov, Robert Heinlein, Arthur Clark,
and Stanford guest lecturer Curt Siodmak. come from
scientific backgrounds. According to Driessel, "Many
science fiction writers now come from the humani
ties."
Science fiction today is starting a "new wave," but
the questions explored are still intriguing. Could our
violent natures be caused by extraterestrial influ
ences? How will the population crisis end'' Can a
democratic government survive? Could dnigs end all
hostility in the world?
What if . ..?

Commentary
Do you believe, "We are what we think our future
is?" The members of the Institute for Science Fiction
and Fantasy are convinced of it.
Grouped under the Graduate Division of Special
Program the Science Fiction Institute consists of
four courses in various aspects of science fiction and
fantasy. But what is science fiction?
A. Berkley Driessel, Assistant to the Provost and
Lecturer in General Studies, suggests, "Science fiction
is that body of extrapolative literature which has
some basis in current scientific fact." Regarded as
more than twenty first century cowboys and indians,
science fiction is a medium for speculation on
science, politics, social systems, education, and the
nature of being human.
"The focus of the institute," says Driessel, "is
hypothesis or model building. Science fiction is a
vehicle for exploring the consequences of various
social and technological changes by building models
of tomorrow which are metaphors that allow a
commonality of inquiry. We build a common frame
of reference through science fiction, making it
possible for a sociologist to view the co- quences of
a biological development without ht. g any real
expertise in the biological sciences."

Driessel emphasized the interdisciplinary potential
of the Institute: "We see its function within the
University as a vehicle by which students from
various fields can integrate their quite different types
of specialized knowledge by imaginative considera
tion of the future, or by imaginative consideration of
other non-reality contexts."
Arthur Hastings, Assistant Professor of Public
Address and Small Group Communication, feels that
science fiction, "is based in plausible social and
technical concepts. You can lake an idea, expand it
to a plausible end and by suspending belief in normal
reality, play with the concept."
"Dealing with the improbable-plausible," is one
way Driessel feels science fiction affords technical
and social speculation. "It's possible for there to be
