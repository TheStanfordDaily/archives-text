## Frees Oppressed Men

I was going to abstain from the Woman
Question discussion, but the articles in last
Friday's Daily are so lacking, that it's necessary to
fill the gap. There has been no discussion in the
Daily yet of the benefit of Women's Liberation to
men or to the radical movement.
The dominant male/submissive female role
playing is mutually destructive. "If you love me,
why don't you beat me?" is just an exaggerated
form of dialogues like:
"I want a man who takes command."
"But that's against my whole ..
"Well, I guess if you don't have it in you ..
"Oh shit, you mistake consideration for
weakness..
It is only Women's Liberation that can kick us
out of such pathological do loops.
Truly liberated women are much more
interesting to talk, work, and be with. It simply is
not that enjoyable to have girls slobber on your
sleeve, laugh at your jokes if they're not that
funny, or agree with your political analysis if it's
for shit. ("Oh, I don't know a thing about
politics.") Finally, it is an immense relief to be
done with The Game.
Psychic Splits
To the many psychic splits found at Stanford
and in the Movement such as mind/body, and
thought/feeling must be added strength/gentleness.
I have seen this split healed only in the few truly
liberated women I know.
A good deal of the machismo, elitism,
competiveness, and ruthlessness that our society
teaches us has been carried over into the
Movement. Women's liberation can serve to
counteract these poses.
(It must be mentioned in passing that some of
the most ritualized macho poses have been struck
by radical women. I would simply say that this is

not a part of being "liberated," although it may be
a by product of the liberation process.)
The women's movement has been a healthy
force in the face of radicalism's present maladies.
It has provided a point of entry into radicalism for
women who, until recently, could find no
identification with any part of the Movement.
Moreover, it has given longtime radical women a
chance to contribute more creatively to the
Movement instead of merely doing shitwork for
the men.
Although many women must at first withdraw
into women's collectives in order to understand
their own situation, it is with amazing speed that
Women's Liberation has linked up its struggle with
the issues of political prisoners, Vietnam, and
black liberation.
Supportive Role
Women played a crucial supportive role in the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel strike, but they are
now playing even more important parts in making
demands from their own positions in the labor
force.
The number of women workers has increased
remarkably in the past two decades. Between 1961
and 1968, for instance, the number of wives in the
labor force increased by one fourth, three times
their population increase, to more than seventeen
million.
The economic demands that women's liberation
makes on capitalism can put a great strain on the
system. I'll resist the temptation to say that
women's demands for better jobs are unmeetable,
even though the system to date has come nowhere
near satisfying demands of blacks, who comprise a
smaller segment of the work force, for employ
ment
I don't know. But even if women are integrated
into the work force in better jobs, the spirit of the
women's movement should provide a continued
antagonistic momentum.
The woman's demand for control over her body
is incompatible with the boss's control over her,
whether he pinches her ass during dictation or
gives her a monotonous series of computer
programs to run.
All too often at Stanford, because of our
relative insulation—because we are not napalmed
daily—radicals have constructed artificial self
images to show that our politics are constant and
that we take them seriously. We see ourselves
clenching rifles, hurdling trenches as we go to take
a building. The women's movement has enabled us
to show what we mean by "Our politics are about
our lives."

blowing out of here real soon.)

The woman's demand for control over her body
is incompatible with the boss's control over her,

All too often at Stanford, because of our
relative insulation—because we are not napalmed
daily—radicals have constructed artificial self
images to show that our politics are constant and
that we take them seriously. We see ourselves
clenching rifles, hurdling trenches as we go to take
a building. The women's movement has enabled us
to show what we mean by "Our politics are about
our lives."

I was going to abstain from the Woman
Question discussion, but the articles in last
Friday's Daily are so lacking, that it's necessary to
fill the gap. There has been no discussion in the
Daily yet of the benefit of Women's Liberation to
men or to the radical movement.
The dominant male/submissive female role
playing is mutually destructive. "If you love me,
why don't you beat me?" is just an exaggerated
form of dialogues like:
"I want a man who takes command."
"But that's against my whole ..
"Well, I guess if you don't have it in you ..
"Oh shit, you mistake consideration for
weakness..
It is only Women's Liberation that can kick us
out of such pathological do loops.
Truly liberated women are much more
interesting to talk, work, and be with. It simply is
not that enjoyable to have girls slobber on your
sleeve, laugh at your jokes if they're not that
funny, or agree with your political analysis if it's
for shit. ("Oh, I don't know a thing about
politics.") Finally, it is an immense relief to be
done with The Game.
Psychic Splits
To the many psychic splits found at Stanford
and in the Movement such as mind/body, and
thought/feeling must be added strength/gentleness.
I have seen this split healed only in the few truly
liberated women I know.
A good deal of the machismo, elitism,
competiveness, and ruthlessness that our society
teaches us has been carried over into the
Movement. Women's liberation can serve to
counteract these poses.
(It must be mentioned in passing that some of
the most ritualized macho poses have been struck
by radical women. I would simply say that this is

not a part of being "liberated," although it may be
a by product of the liberation process.)
The women's movement has been a healthy
force in the face of radicalism's present maladies.
It has provided a point of entry into radicalism for
women who, until recently, could find no
identification with any part of the Movement.
Moreover, it has given longtime radical women a
chance to contribute more creatively to the
Movement instead of merely doing shitwork for
the men.
Although many women must at first withdraw
into women's collectives in order to understand
their own situation, it is with amazing speed that
Women's Liberation has linked up its struggle with
the issues of political prisoners, Vietnam, and
black liberation.
Supportive Role
Women played a crucial supportive role in the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel strike, but they are
now playing even more important parts in making
demands from their own positions in the labor
force.
The number of women workers has increased
remarkably in the past two decades. Between 1961
and 1968, for instance, the number of wives in the
labor force increased by one fourth, three times
their population increase, to more than seventeen
million.
The economic demands that women's liberation
makes on capitalism can put a great strain on the
system. I'll resist the temptation to say that
women's demands for better jobs are unmeetable,
even though the system to date has come nowhere
near satisfying demands of blacks, who comprise a
smaller segment of the work force, for employ
ment
I don't know. But even if women are integrated
into the work force in better jobs, the spirit of the
women's movement should provide a continued
antagonistic momentum.
