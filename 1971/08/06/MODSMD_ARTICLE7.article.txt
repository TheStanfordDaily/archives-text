## Equal Pay Law – Sexist Act 
###

The chief remedy of the reformist as
opposed to revolutionary Women's Lib people
has been the equal pay for equal work idea.
Women do not get as much as men for
performing certain types of work. This is
obviously unjust, is it not?
"THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW is the
response given to the question, and the ladies
are off to the soapboxes and the Congressional
Office Building.
The unfortunate part of the approach of
part of the W.L. movement is that the
consequences of this legislation will be worse
than the situation it is intended to improve.
The unfortunate consequences of this
legislation are not seen because of a misunder
standing of the manner which wages are
determined.
The equal-pay-for-equal-work legislation is
based on the idea that employers arbitrarily
determine wage rates and that he can set them
low and reap tremendous profits unless
government or the labor unions do something.
Middle Man
In the long run it is the consumers who
dictate what the wage rates will be: The
businessman or entrepreneur is a middle man,
trying to use his understanding of the wishes
of the consumers to deliver a product which is
sufficiently valuable to them that he will make
a profit on it.
His profit, if there is one, will depend on his
buying his factors of production below what
the consumers will pay for his product.
As a result of competition by those who
would be glad to produce the same product for
smaller profits and larger prices for wages, raw

materials, etc., there is always the tendency in
the (hypothetical) free market for the profits
earned by the entrepreneur to be squeezed and
disappear.
These include profits earned by holding
wage rates below the market price. If the
entrepreneur in Company A does not want to
lose his workers to his competitors he must
pay each worker pretty close to the value of
the additional product the worker produces.
Marginal Workers
Wage rates are ultimately set, then by the
MARGINAL PRODUCTIVITY OF LABOR,
that is, the market value added to the product
produced by the marginal employee, the last
one hired.
If for any reason, the entrepreneur's cost
rises such that the market value of the product
produced by the marginal worker is not
enough to compensate the business man for his
added costs, the marginal worker will have to
be discharged.
What does all this economic theory have to
do with the equal-pay-for-equal-work legisla
tion? The attempt to raise women's wages by
legislation, thus raising the cost to the
entrepreneur of the marginal women workers
above the market value of their production,
will cause unemployment of women possibly
massive unemployment.
International Case
ENGLAND—Sidney and Beatrice Webb, hardly
apologists for capitalism, mention that at the
turn of the century men typesetters were being
threatened by the lower-priced competition of
women typesetters. So an equal-pay act was
passed; the last woman typesetter died many
years ago.

The author who quoted this example, an
economist named W. H. Hutt, included it in a
little book about the economics of discrimina
tion: "The Economics of the Colour Bar." In
this excellent book, Hutt, an adamant
opponent of the apartheid system, shows that
the nitty-gritty of the apartheid system is our
old friend equal-pay-for-equal-work.
In the South African case, the legislation
keeps the skilled black worker out of the
mines. In the labor market there are what can
be called non-preferred persons. In the South
African and, to a lesser extent, American
situation, it is the black person.
Included in the list of non-preferred persons
is everyone whom, if the employer had to
choose solely on the basis of physical
appearance or other non-monteary considera
tions, would be passed up in competition with
other workers.
If non-preferred workers are allowed to
compete at the lower price that employers are
willing to pay, then they will be hired. Once
they have passed the color or sex or age bar,
their wages will increase as they increase their
productivity.
There is plenty of evidence around to show
the bad effects of government price fixing
upon many of the black people in the U.S. and
South Africa.
Let us not add to this tragedy the forced
unemployment of millions of women. The
"sexist" would be advised to work for the
equal-pay act; women who are concerned with
their own liberation should oppose it—in
effect, if not in design, it is a "sexist"
proposal.
