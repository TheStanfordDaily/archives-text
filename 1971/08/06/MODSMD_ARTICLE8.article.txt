Editor, The Daily:
We as doctors who practice in
the community and at the Stan
ford Hospital wish to express our
outrage at the planned repression
against workers at Stanford that is
being carried out by the admini
stration of the university and the
hospital.
Not satisfied with calling in
170 riot police to forcefully
break-up a peaceful sit-in led by

the Black United Front; not
satisfied with over 220 criminal
charges filed against the partici
pants in this labor dispute; not
satisfied with the blood that is on
its hands from those who were
attacked by the police, the Stan
ford administration has begun to
fire all the workers who they can
identify as being present at the
sit-in.
By firing these five workers for
alleged misconduct resulting from

the sit-in, Stanford has acted as
judge and jury and has surely
eliminated any chance these work
ers have for a fair trial on the 48
criminal charges they are facing.
The threat of more firings as
other workers are identified as
having participated in the sit-in is
surely an attempt to further
intimidate workers into future
inaction.
We will not remain behind the
shield of our profession and stay

silent. President Lyman, Provost
Miller, Mr. Nelson, Dr. Wilson, the
intimidation of workers must stop
and you must use your power to
see that charges against the 24
people still facing criminal prose
cution are dropped.
